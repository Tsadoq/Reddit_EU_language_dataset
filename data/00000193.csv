22,"What are you talking about? Massacres were happening right from the get go, there was the Holocaust by bullet where German soldiers were shooting up villages and columns of refugees promptly after invading Poland. Furthermore, it‚Äôs some sort of sick joke to say that the German population was unaware of the murder- how could they be ignorant, when so many were involved? When trains of Jews and other minorities were taken to hundreds of camps across Germany and areas of German settlement returning with no one, when the smell of death blanketed the land, when millions of Germans were complicit in these crimes it‚Äôs ridiculous to say people just had no clue.

If that was the case and no one knew, why were there groups like the White Rose made of students distant from the war making pleas to do *something* like the following quote?

&gt; Since the conquest of Poland, 300,000 Jews have been murdered in this country in the most bestial way ... The German people slumber on in dull, stupid sleep and encourage the fascist criminals. Each wants to be exonerated of guilt, each one continues on his way with the most placid, calm conscience. But he cannot be exonerated; he is guilty, guilty, guilty!

You can argue that people didn‚Äôt realize the full scale, but the German people *knew* such things were going on. Obviously they weren‚Äôt going to speak up about what they knew after the fact; at least, not unless [they didn‚Äôt know someone was listening](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/bugging-hitler‚Äôs-soldiers-program-transcript/950/).",,/r/europe/comments/ac401h/a_quarter_of_all_holocaust_victims_were_murdered/ed79zqp/,sparkling_uranium,1546575759

108,"How is colouring the London Eye 'throwing away' our national identity? A Europe minded city showing its solidarity is hardly an attempt at erasing anything. You have to keep a few things in mind:

Firstly, the referendum was one by a margin of 1-2 percent, which means that there's no 'clear message' from the people that they want to leave, only a slight majority.

Secondly, even though the leave side won, we're still talking about millions of people that really want to stay.

Thirdly, many of us live as expats, considering how difficult it was to vote on the referendum (the information was not readily available and our vote had to be sent off months beforehand), many of us weren't able to vote, and even those of us that did are in a terrible position thanks to loads of people that didn't pay any attention to how it would be for us.

Fourthly, the UK is a composite state, in which 2 of the four countries absolutely did not want to leave, Scotland and Northern Ireland are being ripped out of the EU (in many ways) due to the English and Welsh. Obviously many Scots and Irish were behind leaving, but even so, it's easy to understand how this could be viewed as other countries weighing through harder than others. 

Lastly, perceptions have changed **a lot** and there's evidence that a second referendum would prove to be different. We now know what the options are, May's deal that pleases nobody is the only deal we're going to get, so the option is May's deal, no-deal (the worst possible outcome) and remain. It would certainly give me the chance to cast my vote as an expat, having missed the last vote (despite being 2 or 3 weeks early of the vote in the UK).",,/r/europe/comments/ac50pz/were_better_together/ed71ez4/,JonoNexus,1546568226

136,"How is the article written? Is it supportive of China's government in general or specifically of Xi Jinping? I myself am sort of fascinated or mesmerized by china.

I ask because you don't have to look too far to find excellent things being done by the government. Motivations aside, China is pushing relentlessly to become a world leader in scientific research. For example the Nature INDEX which tabulates number of high quality scientific papers by county / region / institution which are accepted into quality peer review journals. [China is currently #2](https://www.natureindex.com/annual-tables/2018/country/all) behind the US, and just put down a **13.3% (!!) increase** in the fraction of high quality scientific papers in the world. (BTW, congrats to Austria, Czechia and Norway for also throwing down double digit percent increases! Go science!) You you've probably heard that just put another lander on the moon and have plans to put a rover or lander on Mars by 2020.

Further their government fully understands the social and societal benefits of expensive (and often operating at a loss) infrastructure [such as high speed rail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JDoll8OEFE).

When it comes to transferring energy grids to carbon neutral sources, [China is a goddamn juggernaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_China). They basically have gone from 0 renewables to world leader in installed capacity  [in the space of 5 or 6 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_by_country). This explosion has leveled off to increase its renewable energy share by a cool 1% a year. Also a lot of growth and planned expansion in [Nuclear as well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_China) which is good for stopping climate change.

Finally the quality of life and [HDI for Chinese has been increasing dramatically](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/all/themes/hdr_theme/country-notes/CHN.pdf) for years and look like it should continue.

&amp;#x200B;

**Before any of y'all get mad at me, yes I know that this all does come at a big cost.**

As you know much of this is because China has a single party government, meaning that if there is political will for something, there isn't opposition compared to the mess that democracy can be. And while this may be refreshing when good projects are carried out efficiently, its not so good when it is a bad project like social credit, detaining Tibetan,  [Uyghur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghurs)  and muslin minorities.

But I'm kinda curious of what other people think about it. A lot of people seem to write them off as either CHYNA &gt; communism &gt; bad, or ""the people that make the cheap things I buy"", but it is obviously so much more than that. Do the inevitable benefits to humanity from an educated nation of 1.3 *billion* people outweigh the loss of free speech? With climate change threatening to wipe out humanity, does having an efficient one party energy policy in the worlds biggest CO2 emitter outweigh the loss of religious freedom? China does have a long history with communism and suppression of the people, but as their populace becomes richer, and better educated, will these some day be looked upon as growing pains? It is easy for me to say ""they are doing what needs to be done to overall build a better world"", but I'm not the one sitting in a Muslim re-education camp in Xinjiang.

159,"lmao saying Bolsonaro isn't a fascist isn't defending him. Pinochet wasn't a fascist either.

literally neither of those guys have anything that represents a fascist ideological or economic platform. Where is the nationalizing of the economy, the corporatism, syndicalism, etc etc? 

Opening Brazil and the Amazon to be destroyed by foreign corporations is the exact antithesis of a fascist government, which is anti-global market by nature. If a hypothetical fascist government wanted to destroy the Amazon, they would do it isolated.

So no, a conservative who says he will ""cleanse the street of the enemy"", regardless of the fact that it could have come from Il Duce's own lips, is not a fascist himself.

He could literally start a genocide of Brazil's natives, industrial extermination ala WW2, and no, it still would not be fascism, just because both ideologies are doing the same thing.

And these distinctions are important, even if you're the kind of person who prefers simple answers, and doesn't see any value in differentiating between his own enemies.

186,"&gt; but can't he still be removed by the CPC?

Technically, yes. But you have to understand two things:

a) How power is transfered in China.

Since 1983 the first step to become the (elected) leader of China is replacing the old leader as the Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China. (Actually the old leader will hand it over) Thats where the real source of power is. Who ever controlls this party organ has defacto 100% control over the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army, the Police and the China Militia. And as long as the leader holds that position is basically is untouchable. Through that position he is the one having all the guns and the intelligence sources.

b) The political process:

Further to replace Xi one would need an alternative. A party member the majority of the Chinese communist party can get behind. Obviously Xi would get rid of him. Most likely through corruption charges. Therefor the person must have such tremendous prestige, that a corruption charge can not be sold to the public. Such a person does not exist in China today. Yes, 40 years ago there was Deng Xiaoping, the glorious revolutionary veteran and Maos Paladin. Sure. But the generation of the revolutionary veterans is dead. Maybe 2 or 3 are still alive, but over 100 years old. The arrests and disappearances of Chinese Billionairs shows that money is no protection in Chinas political system. So right now there is nobody who could challenge Xi.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/acbir1/major_newspaper_in_poland_published_a_full_page/ed77555/,zehferris,1546573147

194,"&gt;I know when it was renamed.

If you know it happened less than 100 years ago, then why the evident whining about people that use a name that lasted for roughly 1600 years? 

Do you see any Dutch crying about their country being called Hollandia? Swiss about Helvetia? Let's bring it closer to home, do you see any Greek giving a flying F about Turks calling Thessaloniki Selanik? And yet it's always the Turks that are crying and making it an issue.

We've called the City Constantinople and we're not going to adopt the Turkish mispronunciation of ""Stin Poli"" for the city or any other place (ex. Kos in Turkish became Istankoy). FYI, most Greeks in non-formal conversations would still say ""Stin Poli"".

Here is a song by popular singer Notis Sfakianakis called ""[Ta Klemmena](https://youtu.be/lTS2RtIDDq4?t=110)"" (the stolen).

At the 1:50 mark listen and tell me what your Turkish ear hears when he says ""Stin Poli"" and then ""Aghia Sophia"". Tell me what words Turks adopted for both in your language.

Feel free to find new names if the ""new"" ones you adopted are too Greek for you.

To be clear, I find what the Chinese government is doing there with the reporting on internment and efforts to strip people of their religion and culture to be appalling, especially considering the scale at which it's being carried out. At the same time I remember after travelling through Kunming in early 2014, a few weeks later I read in the news that almost 40 innocent people were killed and over a 100 more injured when separatists stormed the train station in Kunming wielding long fruit knives. 

I don't endorse the violence carried out by those kinds of separatists in China, but the Chinese government does fuck over places like Tibet and Xinjiang.

3) again, can you be more specific ? what tax reform would you like to see and how is the EU stopping it ?

4) so your solution to solving a crisis is to create more deficit ? in a country with 100% of GDP as debt ? what is this economics books you've been reading where the state has an infinite supply of money to draw from ?

Spain's problems rely mostly on bad education that doesn't properly prepare its population, corruption that hampers competitiveness and innovation, lacking infrastructure to secure services and so on.

339,"&gt;Economists are actually surprised this is not happening. It's a strange economic situation right now, since that expected raise is just not happening.

What economists are saying this? [Because despite record inflation, real wages have been growing.](https://www.reuters.com/article/germany-wages/update-3-german-real-wages-rise-despite-higher-inflation-idUSL8N1W625P)

&gt;Yes, because it then ends up as more company profit that primarily serve the upper class which spent do not spent that added money in the economy like a worker on minimum wage would. Trickle down economics does not work.

This is utter nonsense. How do you think banks have money to lend for a prospective homeowner? How do you think an entrepreneur can find funding for his widget which will increase overall productivity? If you want to most direct evidence that trickle down economics work just look at China. It has enormous wealth inequality with very little regulation. And it lifted hundreds of millions out of abject poverty. US startups do so well not just because of a single massive market but because the massive private equity which is available to innovative businesses.

&gt;Look at the difference between median and minimum wages in Germany. The gap there is large. Nobody is talking about removing the gap completely.

And again that does not mean that increasing minimum wages would be a good idea.

&gt;You are here basically advocating for creating a lower class that can not participate in a meaningful way in the economy. If that is the case, there are bigger issues then minimum wage Germany should look at. Because this would create a cycle of poverty those people will not be able to escape from otherwise, creating resentment and trouble down the road.

No I am advocating for the exact opposite. Those whom lack the basic skills which every German has would be able to find employment, make up that skill deficit, and eventually be on par and be able to compete with your regular Germans. The policy which you are advocating for would ensuring the creation of a class of unemployable individuals who have no way to make money, build skills, and build a life for themselves.

365,"The Crusades really had nothing to do with it; if anything Armenians thrived thanks to their relationships to the Franks, allowing them to have a friendly bastion to the south of their kingdom in Cilicia, and benefitting hugely from trade between Europe and their ports in the Levant. The harsh reactions you are thinking must be in reference to some of the Armenians living in the county of Edessa after the crusaders took control of it, but they were just a drop in the pond.

&amp;#x200B;

The decline of the Armenian state is down to two things:

* The pulverisation of the Armenian nobility
* The depopulation of the Armenian highlands

Both the Byzantines and the Persians had a vested interest in dispersing Armenian nobles from their homelands and moving them to other places where they had less potential to unify and were less of threat. They weren't entirely successful, but the Arabs, and especially the Seljuk and Koyunlu Turks, eventually were. Successive invasions and settlements of Arab and Turkish tribes in to the Armenian highlands displaced the nobility and the urban classes, who fled towards the Byzantine Empire and to Georgia, or across the Black Sea into Europe in the latter case.

&amp;#x200B;

And the reason why Armenians weren't able to organise a resurgent nobility again is simply that there eventually weren't enough of them in the end. Thanks to the policies of the Byzantines and the Persians, migration of Armenians out of their homeland accelerated. Hundreds of thousands of Armenians found themselves in Anatolia, Syria, and Macedonia, where they had been settled by Byzantine emperors for various reasons. More fled the subsequent Arab, Seljuk, and Mongol conquests. 

&amp;#x200B;

But it was the invasions of Tamerlane and the Koyunlu Turks in the 14th and 15th centuries that were the most destructive.  Scores of people were massacred, even more sold into slavery - to the degree that it became the first point in the history of Armenia that Armenians no longer constituted a majority in their own land. This was really the point of no return - upwardly mobile Armenians had to reinvent themselves as traders, merchants, craftsmen, and bureaucrats in the great cities of the Middle East and beyond -across the Mediterannean and Indian Ocean too - which they did very successfully. But the peasantry who remained in the Armenian highlands had no real power structures of their own to look after them: on the mid-level they were under the thumb of stronger Kurdish or Turkish chieftains, and on the higher level they were subject to the Ottoman and Persian imperial administrations.

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunes only changed when the Russians conquered Eastern Armenia and invited Armenians from Persia and Turkey to resettle the area to create a stronghold that they could call their own. This was the foundation of the modern South Caucasian republic of Armenia today. The polar opposite happened in Western Armenia, when the Armenian presence there was finally eradicated in the 1915 genocide.",,/r/europe/comments/ac6v94/languages_spoken_in_the_eastern_roman_empire_580/ed6k8xo/,KanchiEtGyadun,1546554521

381,"So much negativity in this thread. So here's mine:  


January -February  


Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage, and Michael Gove all independently of one another suddenly come to the realisation that using dogmatic, sectarian rhetoric in order to further their political careers is wrong and immoral. They convince the eurosceptic part of the UK that brexit was an act of national self-harm based on platitudes and empty notions of nationalism. The UK realises that the EU is primarily an economic union which has enormous benefits, and ask to cancel brexit. The UK is welcomed back with open arms by their European partners, no grudges held.  


March - April:  


Scientists at CERN accidentally discover a safe and practical way of sustaining nuclear fusion, which results in Europe abandoning coal, oil, and natural gas entirely. Eneregy prices drop dramatically thanks to the almost limitless power now available. Electric cars become cheap and easily available. Meanwhile, a new, deadly disease emerges, but for some mysterious reason it only targets people who hold anti-vaxxer views. Ironically, a vaccine is soon developed but, unsurprisingly, it has little use. Soon the disease is eradicated, along with all anti-vaxxer articles on facebook.  


May - June:  


Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain remember where all the money they misplaced in 2008 is. Their debt is eradicated, their economies blossom, and their food gets even better.  


July - August:  


A meeting of European right wing politicians chaired by Orban is secretly recorded. It reveals that the scare-mongering tactics employed by populists serve no other purpose but to galvanise people into voting for them, and the disdain they feel towards the very people who vote for them is explicitly stated. Nationalist movements across the entire continent become marginalized, as more and more Europeans realize that patriotism is more than just symbolism and empty platitudes. Europeans unite in mutual respect, sharing and appreciating each other's cultures.  


September - October:  


Donald Trump accidentally chokes on one of his tiny, tiny hands, but miraculously doesn't die. The experience changes him dramatically, and none of his previous ego and chutzpah can be seen. Instead he becomes a true statesman, uniting Americans and turning the US onto a path of World cooperation.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other side of the globe, a viral video of Vladimir Putin, wearing a pink dress while singing ""She'll be coming 'round the mountain"" emerges on the internet. The Russian media agencies are not able to cover it up, and it is soon seen by most Russians. The macho-man persona of Putin is irreparably damaged, his support dwindles, and he is forced to resign. Confused, the people of Russia elect a new leader, who transforms Russia into a nation where human rights and personal freedoms are held in highest regard. Russia soon becomes a trustworthy partner on the international stage.  


November - December:  


A charismatic Islamic leader emerges in Syria, who creates a new, reformed version of Islam. This version throws off all vestiges of tribal barbarism and sectarianism, and soon muslims of all creeds and nations flock to it. Centuries-old feuds are finally put to an end in the interest of building a better future, and for the first time in decades, the middle east is at peace.

&gt; praising/encouraging violence against journalists and reporters

You mean like violence against Tucker Carson's home? That wasn't him. 

&gt;  trying to imprison political opponents for crimes they have not committed (or at least strongly pushing the idea, since he is actually not able to do it for real yet at least)

Clinton *did* commit a crime by running a private e-mail server while serving as Secretary of State whose communications should've by law been a matter of public record. A better question is, why are you insisting she'd *not* be locked up for it. Pure political bias.

&gt;  using his position for personal economical gain

Possibly, but that's hardly unique for any politician.

&gt; ushing constant propaganda to gaslight and manipulate the public

Heaven forbid a politician has an opinion and attempts to appeal to public

&gt; there's of course also the nepotism

That's awful and surely something never seen in the Democratic party, among the Kennedys or Clintons or so forth.

&gt; constant political rallies when there's not even an election coming up

How terrible.

&gt; the military parade he wants to hold

How terrible.

&gt; constant praise of dictators around the world

He does not accept the Divine Unassailable Unfathomable Wisdom Straight From God's Mouth that the likes of CNN like to push. Many people, like Victor Orban, that the corporate media calls dictators, aren't by any stretch of imagination, whereas his meetings with actual dictators like Kim Jong Un have produced positive results. In short, who cares.

&gt; openly talking about how he wants to implement systems similar to those used by dictators to stay in power

He told a joke and every leftists triggered in horror, as usual.

&gt; Sure. Nothing there.

Okay. Now tell me how the heck is he ANY more dictatorial than any previous US president? How has anything he's done not been within his rights to do so, and indeed his duty to his voters and his country? Has he grabbed himself any unconstitutional power that he isn't entitled to? Nope, he hasn't done anything. He's followed the law. He even let bloody Jim Acosta back in the press conferences when a judge ruled that he should, despite not really needing to hold any press events in the first place. Despite all the whining, he hasn't done anything that's least bit more dictatorial than any US president before him.

418,"&gt;The USA is a republic not a democracy   

Uhm   

&gt;A republic (Latin: res publica) is a form of government in which the country is considered a ‚Äúpublic matter‚Äù, not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are not inherited, but are attained through **democracy, oligarchy or autocracy.** It is a form of government under which the head of state is not a monarch.[1][2][3]

&gt;**In American English**, the definition of a republic refers specifically to a form of government in which elected individuals represent the citizen body[2][better source needed] and exercise power according to the rule of law under a constitution, including separation of powers with an elected head of state, referred to as a constitutional republic[4][5][6][7] or **representative democracy.**   

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic)  

&gt;Representative democracy (also indirect democracy, representative government or psephocracy) is **a type of democracy** founded on the principle of elected officials representing a group of people, as opposed to direct democracy.[2] Nearly all modern Western-style democracies are types of representative democracies; for example, the United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy, France is a unitary state, and the United States is a federal republic.[3]

At least in Julian March it was clearly ethnical. Slavs were supposed to disappear, period. It didn't matter if it's going to be through assimilation or ethnic cleansing. Fascist propaganda here was based on two premises: first, Julian March is a frontier area which was formerly deitalianized; second, the Italian people sacrificed a lot in fight for that land. The obvious implication in both cases was that Slavs were foreign, intrusive and hostile.

The attitude towards Jews was more ambiguous, because fascists at first considered them integrated enough to contribute to their totalitarian nationalist project. ",Istria/Styria,/r/europe/comments/ac4wn3/today_94_years_ago_benito_mussolini_proclaims/ed69kex/,suberEE,1546547278

Instead, Britain‚Äîwhere the political system is in paralysis over the divorce from the EU‚Äîserves as a deterrent to others, a warning of the dangers to a middling global power of pushing national interests to the exclusion of all else.

It‚Äôs a song written during the closing period of the Second World War. Depending who you ask it may or may not be racist.

Canada has formally apologized for both of those things, as well as the head tax on Chinese immigrants, rejecting the Komagatu Maru, and interning Japanese-Canadians in World War 2. 

One of the reason that Canada gets less grief internationally is that it behaves like an adult, taking responsibility for its wrongs, making restitution to the victims, and attempting to prevent the same abuses from recurring.

This isn't to say Canada is perfect. There is a long way to go in reconciling with indigenous peoples, for instance, but at least there is a commitment from all levels of government and most Canadians to keep trying.

Also, during the tenure of the highly conservative government you are referring to, Canada did receive quite a lot of international criticism, particularly for the regressive environmental policies and inaction on climate change.",Canada,/r/europe/comments/ac40gt/us_president_pleased_europeans_are_unhappy_with/ed5y2jo/,jtbc,1546539206

Yes. Utterly so. It's used as a racist dogwhistle more than not.

I see people starting to turn *against* Trump and Brexit, for example, both of which only won through Russian interference, lies and propaganda. I saw Le Pen lose to Macron in France, despite the very same conditions. I saw Merkel win again in Germany. Again, despite the best efforts of certain groups.

&gt; This is just the start and I'm grateful that we have Trump who is actively trying to fix these problems.  
  
Sure, Trump is *totally* fixing those problems. By implementing tarriffs that are hurting the US economy and driving companies bankrupt... turning against allies and treating them like shit... acting subservient to Russia and Saudi Arabia in almost any matter he can...  
  
Is the fact that Trump's golf clubs are staffed by illegal immigrants also him fixing these problems? Or the fact that he hires immigrants for his other companies and clubs as well? Or the fact that he puts all manufacturing he runs (his MAGA caps, for example) outside America?

659,"&gt;The EU is a particularly weak military ally

I don't necessary agree with you there. On military expenditure France ranks 6th and the UK 7th, Germany 9th and Italy 12th. The EU combined would be as much as China, by the way. It's ironic that the US president actually mocked the idea of an European army. 

Not only that, you're forgetting soft power. War isn't only fought with weapons, it's also economical and diplomacy. the EU is a huge economy and a war with EU would mean a huge economic crash. A war against the US AND EU would mean an absolute breakdown. 

&gt;a huge trade imbalance with the US. 

&gt;We run a huge trade deficit with the EU. $147 Billion. 

You are not 'losing' by having a 'trade deficit'. A trade deficit isn't bad, the US has it with **many** countries.

&gt;(that would be Australia, Canada, or possibly Japan).

The [US has a trade deficit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_the_United_States) with Canada amounting around $17 billion. Japan? **$68 billion.** Australia is the only country of those three you have a surplus with, and it's only 14 billion. 

Canada, Australia and Japan spend LESS on their military then France or the UK. The EU as a whole dwarfs countries like Canada, Australia or Japan.

According to your own arguments, those other allies _suck._ 

&gt;What is the point of NATO? It was founded to keep the Soviets out of Europe, but there is no Soviet Union anymore. The US gets very little from the alliance, as Europe's militaries are less and less effective every year. If Europe cannot defend itself, what use is it as a military ally to anyone else?

The US gets a safe EU out of NATO, which is good for their economy. The US gets an EU they have control and influence over. 

The US waves their big dick (military) and in turn the EU listens to US voices. The US has a voice in Europe because you let us use your big dick. The US spends their military as diplomatic currency. That's why you spend so much money on it, that and the war industry. 

You assume that European countries can't defend themselves, but I'm not really sure if that's the case. Again, their spending isn't that low compared to other countries, and certainly not compared to countries around the EU (without those countries also crashing and burning economically in a war). Against whom would they be fighting, anyway? Against... 

...the Russians? The Soviets aren't gone, right there in the north. Different name, sure. Russia is your geopolitical opponent, by the way. Another reason that NATO is helpful for you. If the US wants to keep Russia in its place and make sure it doesn't get strong again, they'll be smart to help the EU.

You'd think that Russia would be a potential ally, maybe? You've got a trade deficit with them. Economy? Comparable to Italy. Their military is pretty great, though. If you love allies that are dictators and only care about warfare than sure, great choice!

&gt;If Europe wants beter relations with the US, maybe not calling every Republican in the US a racist NAZI would be a good start.

I never called any Republican a Nazi, and I totally agree with you that calling Republicans is wrong. 

*BUT* Europe does know the tactics of Nazi's, history and all that, so if European countries tell you that there might be some parallels with Europe in the past and the US now, they might have some good points? Again, Republicans aren't Nazi's, but it's a warning that something like Nazism *can* happen.

731,"*Author: Ambrose Evans-Pritchard*

&gt;To be charitable, you could say the euro has proved itself merely by surviving until its 20th birthday this January. That is a low bar.

&gt;Monetary union has otherwise failed as an economic and political endeavour. The evidence of Europe's 'Lost Decade' is that it can only ever be made to work under a regime of technocrat Caesaropapism, that is to say by stripping elected parliaments of their lifeblood control over taxation, spending, and the core economic policies of the nation state.

&gt;‚ÄúOne day, the house of cards will collapse,‚Äù says Professor Otmar Issing, the founding chief economist of the European Central Bank and the chastened prophet of the euro project.

&gt;The London School of Economics has assembled package of papers by illuminati from Europe and North America to mark this week‚Äôs anniversary, published by the journal Comparative Political Studies.

&gt;Mark Copelovitch, Jeffry Frieden, and Stefanie Walter do not pull their punches in the prologue. The calamitous EMU saga has led to the ‚Äúmost serious economic crisis in the history of the European Union‚Äù. It has done ‚Äúmore lasting damage‚Äù to swaths of Europe than the Great Depression of the 1930s, and pitted eurozone states against each other in a bitter struggle for control over the levers of policy.

&gt;The political dynamics have become poisonous. Years of rolling crisis ‚Äúentrenched and amplified the power and influence of creditor countries such as Germany‚Äù, working through the ECB and the European Council.

&gt;In other words, EU bodies became debt collectors for the creditor bloc, and enforcers of a German-imposed strategy of debt deflation and fiscal contraction. The burden of adjustment fell on the weaker states, leading to a contractionary bias for the whole system. The Nobel fraternity have watched this display of pre-modern and pre-Keynesian illiteracy with a mixture of horror and despair.

&gt;Yet nothing is actually changing. There has been no Truth and Reconciliation to probe the disaster that was allowed to unfold. Those in control of the EU machinery still think they were right. The ideology prevails.

&gt;The LSE papers said EU leaders have responded at every stage with half measures in a ‚Äúsequential cycle of piecemeal reform‚Äù, just enough to stop the collapse of EMU without resolving the core deformities of an orphan currency with no fiscal union to back it up. ‚ÄúWhat is clear is that the status quo cannot persist indefinitely if the Euro is to survive in the long term,‚Äù it said.

&gt;I would argue that the spectacle of an EU in such a shambles from 2010 to 2015 led directly to Brexit.  It profoundly shook the moral prestige of the EU, and demolished claims of economic competence.

&gt;While EU leaders quibbled over decimal points and debt repayment in Brussels, youth jobless rates reached 57pc in Greece, 56pc in Spain, and much the same across Italy‚Äôs Mezzogiorno.  These were levels once unthinkable in a modern developed democracy. They have left a wreckage of ‚Äòlabour hysteresis‚Äô that will lower economic speed limits for a generation to come.

&gt;Several hundred thousand economic refugees came to work in Britain from the EMU depression belt. A further wave from Eastern Europe came to the UK instead of going to the eurozone as they would have done in normal times. The double surge had maximum impact just before the Referendum.

&gt;More subtly, the euro crisis revealed that the pathologies of monetary union cannot be managed by normal democratic means. The elected prime ministers of Greece and Italy were toppled in 2010 and 2011 and replaced by EU  functionaries in soft coups organized by Brussels and the pro-EMU vested interests of each country.

&gt;The ECB switched off liquidity support for Greek commercial banks in 2015, knowingly (and illegally?) precipitating a banking collapse that was hard to reconcile with the ECB‚Äôs treaty duty to uphold financial stability. When push come to shove, the reflex was authoritarian. It spoke to the character of the EU. That I why I voted for Brexit.

&gt;The LSE says the euro crisis was predictable and was in fact widely-predicted. It mimicked countless episodes in Latin America, East Asia, and other emerging markets, where debtors borrowed heavily in dollars that they could not print.

&gt;The pattern is for countries to succumb to credit booms while money is loose and the ‚Äòcarry trade‚Äô is in full bloom. They spiral into busts when confidence evaporates and the capital flows dry up. This is the classic ‚Äòsudden stop‚Äô faced by states that do not borrow in their own currency.

&gt;Europe‚Äôs elites imagined that current account deficits did not matter in the magical euro union, even though the deficit states in Southern Europe and Ireland had lost their sovereign policy instruments and no longer had a lender-of-last resort behind them. They were therefore no different from Argentina or Thailand.

&gt;The elites also failed to grasp that fixed exchange rate systems (without full fiscal union) switch currency risk into default risk. The rating agencies also missed this elephant in the room and so did the International Monetary Fund, as it confessed later in its devastating mea culpa. Ideological capture drained everybody of their senses.

&gt;The illusion that monetary union was risk-free led to epic bubbles, made worse by a one-size-fits-all interest rate set for German needs when Germany was in trouble.

&gt;When the storm hit, the Berlin-Frankfurt-Brussels riposte was to misrepresent what was in essence as a cross-border banking and capital flow crisis as if it were caused by fiscal profligacy in the South. This became the ‚Äòmorality tale‚Äô version of EMU. It lives on in the policy structure.

&gt;It was and is fundamentally bogus - except for Greece under New Democracy - but it served the interests of Northern creditors. Prof Issing says the rescue of Greece in 2010 was in fact a bail-out for French and German banks. The IMF has admitted that the country was in effect sacrificed to save the euro and the European banking system at a delicate moment.

&gt;Yes, the South was naive. Nations feasted on the windfall of lower interest rates. They let unit labour costs ratchet up, even as Germany was ratcheting them down through the Hartz VI wage squeeze in what was objectively - if not intentionally - a beggar-thy-neighbour policy. They forgot that they cannot devalue their way back to exchange rate equilibrium.

&gt;The EU‚Äôs cardinal error was to then try to force the high-debt states to claw back 20pc or 30pc lost labour competitiveness against Germany through ‚Äòinternal devaluations‚Äô, a euphemism for slashing demand. This was self-defeating even on its own crude terms. It shrank the economic base and drove up debt ratios faster through the denominator effect.

&gt;The LSE says the result of so much damage is that the eurozone‚Äôs troubles today ‚Äúappear disturbingly similar‚Äù to those of Japan, trapped in deflationary stagnation for twenty years with broken banks. Except that euroland is not Japan. It is not a cohesive society with a monetary and fiscal machinery working in harmony. ‚ÄúEurope‚Äôs debt problems look even more serious and threatening,‚Äù it said.

&gt;Debt-to-GDP ratios in a string of vulnerable countries are far closer to the danger line now they were at the onset of the global financial crisis a decade ago -  up from 68pc to 125pc in Portugal, 36pc to 98pc in Spain, 99pc to 131pc in Italy, 65pc to 99pc in France, 54pc to 96pc in Cyprus, and 103pc to 176pc in Greece (despite haircuts).

&gt;A weaker euro, interest rates of minus 0.4pc, quantitative easing (six years too late), and a belated end to fiscal austerity, did induce a modest cyclical recovery from 2015 to 2017 but it is not self-sustaining and is already petering out.

&gt;The eurozone risks crashing into next the global downturn with no defences. Rates cannot drop any lower. There is no proper banking union with pan-EMU deposit insurance. The dangers of a sovereign-bank ‚Äòdoom loop‚Äô remain. They are on full display again in Italy.

&gt;Emmanuel Macron‚Äôs grand plan to rebuild EMU on safer foundations has come to nothing. There is no fiscal entity worth the name. Counter-cyclical budget stimulus to fight shocks is prohibited by the machinery of the Stability Pact and Fiscal Compact. The ECB is still unable to act as a full lender-of-last resort.  

&gt;Berlin has written a ‚Äòdebt brake‚Äô into the German constitution, a way of telling the world that it will not take any serious steps to reduce a current account surplus of 8pc of GDP - a much greater threat to EMU survival than anything happening in Greece.

&gt;The LSE team takes a long view, comparing the eurozone‚Äôs travails to struggles between Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson over the handling of state debts in the United States. The battle saw disputes over the First and Second National Banks and lasted until the completion of US monetary union in the 1870s - and took a civil war to resolve. ‚ÄúCrafting a functioning economic and monetary union is a long hard road,‚Äù they said.

&gt;The presumption is that the Europe‚Äôs leaders must in the end agree to some form of fiscal union but this runs into the fundamental barrier of democracy. Such a system would eviscerate the tax and spending prerogatives of elected parliaments, forgetting the lessons of the English Civil War and indeed the American Revolution.

&gt;It can retain democratic legitimacy only if the EU goes the whole way to a supranational federal union akin to the USA, and for this there is not the slightest popular support in any major country. 

&gt;The ineluctable conclusion is that a monetary union of budgetary sovereign states cannot be made to work, and should not be made to work. The euro is a constitutional anomaly. It must therefore be broken up. All else is self-deception.",,/r/europe/comments/ac630o/the_euro_has_failed_threatens_democracy_and/ed5fac5/,In_der_Tat,1546524977

Spanish flue has nothing to do with Spain, but it got the name because Spain was the only major country reporting on the issue, since it wasn't fighting in WW1. They reported the problem so they must be at the heart of the problem.

We hear about all the nonsense that's happening in the US, so it must be unique to the US.

Canada did some absolutely horrible things to it's native population as late as the 1980's. They denied a ship of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany with the Canadian PM stating ""None are too many!""
They had a highly conservative government that among other things promoted the use of asbestos throughout the world. Do they get shit for that? No.

That, plus the innate joy that Europeans take on sneering and calling Americans racist warmongering baby-killers because they actually have a military.  Oh, that's enraging.  

Europe's vaunted exports only go to sea because the US Navy keeps the sea lanes clear.  For free.  Europe gets a big fat bonus of $150 billion every year in the form of unfair trade deals.  These deals were put into place during the Cold War as gigantic bribes to stay on the free world side.  You'd think Europeans wouldn't need bribes to be on the good guys' side, but apparently that wasn't the case.  

It's amazing to me that Europeans feel butthurt about Trump finally insisting on equality.  It's like all these freebies are some kind of birthright.  Well, since they've been going since before you were born, I suppose that is indeed the case.  

&gt;US voters are perfectly happy to completely shit all over their supposed allies.

1167,"Short answer: No.

Long answer: Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.

Serious answer: Not a chance, what made Velvet Divorce possible was the cultural and historical context between Slovaks and Czechs. The same context is much different between Slovaks and Hungarians. Czechs are viewed as our ""brothers"". Hungarians on the other hand, if I had to choose a single word, would be ""oppressors"". Granted, the relationships have improved a lot and these days only hardcore nationalists think that way. But if Hungary suddenly tried to take large parts of Slovak land away, that would revert back real quick.  
Just from a historical context, the last time that was done isn't exactly viewed positively around here. Outside of Czechoslovakia [the Munich agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement) and the relevant-to-this-conversation [First Vienna Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Vienna_Award) may have neutral names, but over here they are called Munich Betrayal and First Vienna Diktat. Trying that shit again would basically bring back the historical context of WW2, which I'm sure no one wants.

There were intermarriages and even cases of Venetians converting to Orthodoxy by themselves. That kind of relationship became even better during the late stages of Venetian rule where the fear that the Turks might conquer Crete (said island) was growing, so the Venetians were something like the last hope of the locals.

On the other hand, when Ottomans conquered Crete, some rich Venetians converted to islam because they didn‚Äôt want to lose their properties. Those Venetian converts to islam had a reputation of being more barbaric than the Turks themselves. But the same thing can be said about the local Greeks who converted to islam too. They were always stereotyped as hating the christian Greeks more than anything. That lead to a lot of violence.

Because by paying more than minimum wage they get to choose workers who are better and more productive than those who are making minimum wage. If the cost of a lousy worker is what it used to be the cost of a good worker then a business must either accept a loss in productivity in less effective workers or face pressure to increase wages to yet again get workers who are more productive. However if this exceeds the costs of investing in either moving out of country or using greater automation to improve productivity then the business will do so.

The net result as it has been often before, will be less people employed and small businesses will have a harder time growing as the minimum cost of productivity has artificially increased.",,/r/europe/comments/abjorc/germanys_minimum_wage_is_barely_above_the_poverty/ed4q0ou/,yabn5,1546491890

1329,"Uh, when you fail to uphold the terms of a military alliance, those aren't allies. Can anyone blame the US? Europe (and Germany especially) has sought to exploit the collapse of the Soviet Union for economic and political gain and in doing so has provoked the paranoia and anger in Russia that has created Putin.  

To do so whilst relying on US-funded security and expecting to be treated as the equal of the USA in global affairs is absurdly presumptuous, arrogant and ungrateful.

Europe will now reap what it has sown: a hostile Russia and a self-interested USA.

The icing on the cake is the withering criticism America is subject to every time our name comes up.  The derision, the sneering elitism, the laughter at the stupid barbarians.  Calling us baby-killing warmongers.  Those were your true feelings, too, you made it quite well known.  It wasn't some ""only joking mate"" act.

There are predominantly black churches, and these range across sects, mostly Baptist, but also Methodist and Pentecostal. That being said, these sects are by no means solely Black; the largest Baptist ""institution"" is the SBC, of which only a 5th of the constituent congregations are classified as minority congregations, and the Baptist tradition itself is generally agreed to hail from 17th century English separatists.

So again, there is no such thing as a gospel church. Gospel is a genre of music. Saying that ""American gospel churches are very often black"" is in and of itself meaningless unless ""gospel"" is code for ""black"", in which case the statement becomes ""American black churches are very often black"" which is a tautology, not to mention a stupid euphemism in the first place.

That all being said, the original point is that most American churches are ethnically European, which is true even within the Baptist community.

And in the exact same *relative* sense, DB does a better job than I initially thought.

Particularly once you realise the monstrous task DB has: They operate one of densest and most highly frequented full-scale railway network on the planet and move around the biggest chunk of Germany's export wonder economy, from north to south, east to west, every day, on budget and comparatively cheap, all while being dangerously underfunded for years and constrained by a corporate structure that isn't really helping to facilitate enything since the German government still didn't manage to decide whether DB is a state agency or a private enterprise, which means that DB AG has the worst of both worlds.

You can't say that ulemas are an authority, since there can be many of them and they can claim what they want, and no one is above em who could make their arguments null. There is no muslim church with an authority. 
Also, islam is very tightly connected to politics, and the goals of the religion are a bit different than the other two. While I consider today's Christianity as a conservative hippie kumba yo kinda thing, to put it that way, judaism is still closed up and has no interest spreading.

As if there's only one answer?  Open borders and take in all of these uneducated people from hostile cultures?  Frankly most of the problems the EU has today stem from this same attitude: completely ignoring the wants and needs of the people of the EU.

1405,"We don't have the high population densities to make these networks viable in the vast majority of the country. The northwest corridor (Washington to Boston that connects 5 large cities in an almost straight line) has the necessary population density, but is so densely populated, that it is estimated to cost 150 billion to upgrade like 500 km or track. Our national train network (Amtrack) has shitty reliability because it does not own many of its own tracks, and therefor freight trains get priority. Rental fees on the tracks make tickets very expensive even though they are subsidized. Being that the northwest corridor is the only profitable branch of Amtrack, there is little incentive for them to upgrade it.

Additionally, American cities are lees dense and larger than European ones, so even if you arrive in a city via train, you are likely still a un-walkable distance to your destination and will need an additional form of transportation. Combined with low gas prices, many Americans, for better or worse, find it more convenient or cheaper to just drive.

There is a short distance of high speed line somewhere in the northeast but its like 30 km or something stupid. A high speed line from San Francisco to San Jose is currently being built.

I love Elon, but I'm not a fan of hyperloop. Even his wildest predictions do not allow for many passengers/hour so I think it is a very expensive complex solution that will have little effect. As for as I know, nobody is seriously building one but him. On the other hand, If his ""Boring Company"" diggers are as fast and cheap as he claims, I could see digging a tunnel through the northwest corridor for a high-speed line to be a good solution.

* In the same vein, the Swiss-EU institutional agreement will be a pathetic failure, and as a result the Bilateral Agreements 1 will be terminated. Not sure if the timetable for that last one will still fit in 2019 though, it'll most likely happen between mid-2019 to end-2020.

Never trust Martin the Berlaymonster! On the other hand, the ECB's presidency will go to Jens Weidmann.

That's what I thought until the Gilets Jaune debacle happened anyway - now they might exchange roles and give the ECB presidency to a Frenchman and the Commission presidency to a German. The French might not tolerate a teutonic ordoliberalist teaching them fiscal discipline, while a German EC president could heat up German European leadership and willingness for reforms in the face of a laming Merkel. Wait and see, I suppose.

* In keeping with the mood, the European Parliament elections will result in a slight gain for EU-sceptics, with low overall voter turnout. As usual.

* The next recession will hit or be about to, and it's going to be 2008 again but without the lube.

* Switzerland will stay in the top 20 economies by nominal GDP

You are attacking my character and my attributes by calling me daft and an idiot instead of staying on topic. I think it's 

&gt;you have yet to address why upholding national sovereignty is somehow an act of pushing ""radical european values""

I think the ECHR should overrule any national blasphemy laws that infringe on a persons freedom of speech as is stated in the European convention. Especially in cases like this where the person accused was just stating well known fact about a historic figure. If that means overruling national sovereignty so be it. If they're not allowed to overrule national sovereignty what is the purpose of a supranational court in the first place? Either disband it or force it to comply with the basic rights as stated in the European Convention and overrule the verdicts from national courts that are in violation.

I live in Poland (not a native here) but the pre-fab commie era towerblocks are quite popular on the market now, as the older stuff ages badly and the new capitalist apartments often have thin walls and other issues.

&gt; Most striking is the emergence of sharp regional differences. Whereas 96% of those living in the East felt safe in their city only 76% of those living in the West shared that feeling. On the other hand, almost one in four in the West (24%) felt unsafe in their city in contrast to only 4% of those in the East. This regional variation is noteworthy and has historical significance for Jews in Europe. It is a reversal of the situation whereby over the past two centuries the ‚ÄúWest‚Äù was regarded as more welcoming and safer for Jews than the ‚ÄúEast.‚Äù

My mum works in Banedanmark, which is the company responsible for most of the Danish railways system, and she worked with this as it was happening. 

Basically what happened, was that a trailer from the freight train was blown off of the wagon, and right into the front of the passenger train.

My mum is convinced that something must've been wrong with how the trailer was secured, despite of the media saying it was likely only because of the wind.

But how could wind have blown a loaded trailer off of the wagon anyways? Well. The freight train was on its way to a beer brewery, returning with empty bottles. It often goes back and forth with full bottles one way, and empty bottles the other way. This trailer was full of empty beer bottles, so it was very light. Still it should not have been possible.

&gt; The came policy that was pushed by the Cyprus government before the invasion, which continue to push for ethnic segregation in order for the two sides to unify. Nothern Cyprus also has a seperate government that is just funded by Turkey, a government that has voted several times for unification. 

Excuse me but the Cypriot state was not created by Cypriots, but by foreign powers. Their constitution was imposed by UK, GR and TR. Their state had very weak institutions on purpose, which led to the clash between the communities. The Cypriot state never endorsed the horrible deeds done by the EOKA-B, but claiming the island is 100% Turkish and ignoring the fact it's been Greek in culture and language for millennia as MANY Turks do is dishonesty. If anyone wants ethnic segregation nowadays it's definitely not the Greek community.  
Reunification was rejected in the Annan plan by the Southern unoccupied areas [for a number of reasons](https://ifestos.edu.gr/a-principled-basis-for-a-just-and-lasting-cyprus-settlement-in-the-light-of-international-and-european-law-by-the-international-expert-panel-convened-by-the-committee-for-a-european-solut/), and they were very reasonable if you ask me.  
It's about time real Cypriots (no matter if Greek, Turkish, Armenian or Maronite) take the reins of their country and expel the invaders.  


&gt; I was referring to the PKK because a huge chunk of ""Turks being genocidal"" news are just about the Turkish military killing PKK members. Soes the military also raid civilian villages? Yes, and I'm not saying it's not wrong, but so does the PKK which are reported as a freedom fighting rebel group by the BBC. The page they have on it is just messed up. 

I'm by no means defending PKK but I can see why they're so violent against the Turkish state after all the shit they had to put up to. Either way, Kurds, be them members of the PKK or not, have the right to constitute their own state if they so want, according to international law.

You literally have no idea what the greco-turkish war was, let alone know about any war crimes.

Greece has never done any war crimes and that's a fact unlike Germany which has been found guilty and accountable for. 

No one blames young generations of what the previous ones did, but nations as a whole and countries have a historic continuity and political accountability which can't be erased, excused or forgotten. Today's Germany isn't Nazi Germany but that doesn't erase Germany's international obligations or moral accountability of its past. History is history, not a criminal record which you can erase. If you don't like Germany's crime history then sorry to be you, its how things go.

Especially in WW2's case there is no way to even compare what the Nazis did with anyone else. The Nazis were evil - #period#. What the Allies did were in direct response of the Nazis total war mentality. Trying to even up is what a Nazi would do.

No, because in order to follow this logic, there would have to be quite a few christian nations which do it, which there isn't. On the other hand, practically all Islamic nations follow a similar ideology.

The vast majority of Islamic nations imprison if not execute gays.

There are maybe 2 or 3 Christian nations (mostly in sub-Saharan Africa) out of the rest of the world that do. Pretty much every Islamic nation with the exception of Turkey, openly pushes imprisonment or execution for sodomy or homosexuality.

02/01/2017 17:45 Some 4,000 people attended the commemoration of the 525th anniversary of the entry of the Catholic Monarchs into the city, according to the traditional ceremonial, in which the central point lies in the tremolation of the Royal Standard from the balcony of the Town Hall.The presence of a detachment of the Legion and the parade of groups of Moors and Christians displaced from the towns of the province where this festival has tradition have added presence of Granada before the City Hall and the streets through which the procession ran, a concentration of people who has extinguished the echoes of extremists of left and right that - as has become usual in recent years - have tried to monopolize for themselves the meaning of the commemoration on a day declared a holiday in the local calendar by decision of the first republican corporation in 1932. The epochal procession, in which together with the replicas of the Banner and the sword of King Ferdinand, together with the first coat of arms of the city and the traditional trades of the city are reproduced, has opened the celebration, accompanying the municipal corporation to the Royal Chapel, where the tumuli that housed the mortal remains of the Catholic Monarchs are conserved. Councillor Juan Antonio Fuentes (PP) carried the Banner, which he ceded to Raquel Fern√°nde, also of the PP, who shook him in front of the tombs of Isabel and Fernando. The councillors of Vamos Granada-Podemos and IU have not attended the events.

A group of Moors, one of the novelties of this year's takeover. M. RODR√çGUEZ
A 'Te Deum' in the Royal Chapel, where the first civil and military authorities of the province waited, has preceded the religious ceremony in the Cathedral, from where the retinue in full returned to the Plaza del Carmen, seat of the City Council, where thousands of Grenadians had concentrated to respond to the traditional 'what' with which the crowd answers the invocations of the councilman in charge of tremolar the Banner. With a firm voice, Fuentes has invoked Granada for up to three months, as established by protocol, Granada, with live to Spain, the Catholic Monarchs, the King and Granada, while the National Anthem plays. The municipal band, for its part, has interpreted the anthems of Andalusia and Granada, also highly applauded by the public attending the events, among the public, minority groups, in smaller numbers than in previous years according to sources of the Local Police, have not ceased to throw slogans in one direction or the other from positions of extreme right and extreme left. Independence flags of Andalusia have been seen along with the pre-constitutional flags of Spain and Phalanx, New Force and National Democracy. The applause and cheers of the public have extinguished the cries of some and others, although the party has not regained the sense of family that it had in its origins before the latent threat of incidents that for the time being, and since there are concentrations of extremists, have not gone beyond verbal violence. The mayor of Granada, the socialist Francisco Cuenca, referred to the journalists the character of ""celebration and respect"" and the historical significance of the commemoration that was established in the Capitulaciones signed by Isabel and Fernando with Boabdil, the last king of the Nasrid dynasty. A representation of the delivery has closed the official commemoration of the Taking in front of the monument to Boabdil, starring the groups of Moors and Christians, in parallel, other groups that oppose the commemoration have held a rally elsewhere in the city.

2008,"&gt;By Karolina Wigura and Jaroslaw Kuisz

Let's take a more in-depth look at these two authors.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karolina_Wigura

&gt;Her academic interests include political philosophy, especially of Hannah Arendt, Paul Ricoeur, and Karl Jaspers; sociology and ethics of memory, with a focus on transitional justice, historical guilt, reconciliation and forgiveness in politics ‚Äì these are the core themes of the book she published in 2011, titled ‚ÄúThe Guilt of Nations. Forgiveness as a Political Strategy‚Äù;[2] she also devotes her research to the history of emotions, as well as emotions and passions in politics. 

&gt;Between 2012 and 2016, she was a member of the board of Stefan Batory Foundation. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Batory_Foundation

&gt;The Stefan Batory Foundation (Polish: Fundacja im. Stefana Batorego) is an independent Polish non-government organization established by American financier and philanthropist, George Soros and a group of Polish opposition leaders of 1980s

So in other words, a Soros shill who spent a considerable amount of time in her academic endeavors pushing white guilt and whose political interests seem to be inspired by members of the Tribe^^TM or those associated with members of the tribe.

Jaroslaw Kuisz on the other hand seems to be a far-left activist journalist who writes not only for the New York Times, a Jewish-owned newspaper, but also several far-left newspapers and publications. He, too, seems to have surprisingly many personal connections to members of the tribe, including, again, George Soros and many others:

The problem with nuclear is what do you factor into the costs? There are nuclear plants for which long term waste disposal has not even been solved, no one wants to take in the waste, regardless of how much cash they are offered. How much cost should be factored in, when the cost is unknown?

Another problem with nuclear is the huge costs if anything goes wrong. Fukushima will cost $1tn to clean up ... should that $1tn be factored into the costs of nuclear power generation?

3) His authoritarian tendencies will be challenged on the supreme court. The opposition will be very much concerned for his pick of supreme court justices.

4) He will treat journalists with disrespect (he already did this yesterday during his inauguration).

5) He will either cut relations or have bad relations with Cuba and Venezuela, but won't do the same for other dictatorships. Some tension may grow between Brazil and Venezuela, but no war will actually occur.

""The  increased  risk  of  childhood  leukaemia  associated  with  living  in  a  rural  area  did  not  in  itself  account for the increased risk associated with living near a nuclear power plant.

\&gt;Is a life that is thrown into foster care equally worth as a life that is nurtured by a loving family? Statistically speaking that is not how it is.

I think society would try and protect both.

But we didn't, because despite knowing about climate change for 40 years, nobody asked himself the hard questions before now, which evil is better ? Also our dumb mayor don't want us to build offshore wind power stations because it's not pretty. Turns out just with those we wouldn't need anything. Wind is good we you have a lot of sea and we do, but our mayors are dumb piece of shits.

Also to run safe we have between a third and half of our reactors being stopped at any point in time, which means we can't produce as much energy as we could. Hence, we import energy during winter from out neighbour, but we also provied energy to almost all of neighbours at all times so it kinda evens out.

2415,"The ""uses waste"" thing is super oversimplified unfortunately.

One company making these claims had to back down on these claims after their own professors smacked them down.

https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603731/nuclear-energy-startup-transatomic-backtracks-on-key-promises/

""asserted that its molten-salt reactor design could run on spent nuclear fuel from conventional reactors and generate energy far more efficiently than they do. In a white paper published in March 2014, the company proclaimed its reactor ‚Äúcan generate up to 75 times more electricity per ton of mined uranium than a light-water reactor.‚Äù""

""the company downgraded ‚Äú75 times‚Äù to ‚Äúmore than twice.‚Äù In addition, it now specifies that the design ‚Äúdoes not reduce existing stockpiles of spent nuclear fuel‚Äù or use them as its fuel source.""

The thing everyone forgets to mention about reusing spent fuel in MSRs is you need to reprocess it first. Standard used nuke fuel is noble-metal clad urania pellets of various enrichments depending on the reactor design. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fuel

After irradiation and use in a normal reactor, you mostly have uranium left inside, but the x% that has undergone fission and/or neutron capture is extremely active. Some U238 becomes Pu239/Pu240/Pu241 from catching some neutrons. The reason it is considered spent is the shit formed absorbs neutrons so well that it makes it very difficult to use in the reactor. When they say they can reuse spent fuel, they don't refer to what would be the ideal case, simply taking out a spent rod from a traditional reactor and adding it to the molten salt reactor. They need to separate out the most benign as well as useful isotopes, those of uranium and plutonium generally. The way they do this involves dissolving all the spent fuel in acid, which if done too soon can release a ton of volatile isotopes into the atmosphere (eg. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Run where a huge area of washington state was exposed to airborne releases of I131 causing tons of cancer cases)

So normally they cool it for a few years first. The chemical process of turning spent solid fuel pellets into a MSR-compatible fuel (uranium chlorides) results in tons of high-level, aqueous nuclear waste which is actually harder to safely store long term and is a larger environmental risk than spent fuel.

Imagine you spill a few pellets of spent fuel outside; whatever, they are pellets, you (or your remote robot, better plan) can pick them up and put them away semi-safely (caveat: it takes you years to do it and it oxidizes to more environmentally-mobile forms, then cleanup is much harder). Reprocessing waste is solution based, the shit they are still dealing with at Hanford, after leaking into the river for decades. Compare a spill of this to trying to clean milk up off your lawn; its not going to happen, and it will spread much more readily through groundwater movement.

So naturally every location with an extensive nuclear reprocessing history is an environmental nightmare. For example Mayak, russia reprocesses spent nuclear fuel and is pretty much the most polluted spot on the planet: http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/radwaste-storage-at-nuclear-fuel-cycle-plants-in-russia/2011-12-russias-infamous-reprocessing-plant-mayak-never-stopped-illegal-dumping-of-radioactive-waste-into-nearby-river-poisoning-residents-newly-disclosed-court-finding-says

""Between 2001 and 2004, around 30 million to 40 million cubic meters of radioactive waste ended in the river Techa, near the reprocessing facility, which ‚Äúcaused radioactive contamination of the environment with the isotope strontium-90.‚Äù The area is home to between 4,000 and 5,000 residents. Measurements taken near the village Muslyumovo, which suffered the brunt of both the 1957 accident and the radioactive discharges in the 1950s, showed that the river water ‚Äì as per guidelines in the Sanitary Rules of Management of Radioactive Waste, of 2002 ‚Äì ‚Äúqualified as liquid radioactive waste.‚Äù""

And the entry of reprocessing waste into the environment created a lake so polluted you can't even stand near it without getting a lethal dose: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Karachay

""Karachay is the most polluted place on Earth from a radiological point of view.[2] The lake accumulated some 4.44 exabecquerels (EBq) of radioactivity over less than one square mile of water,[3] including 3.6 EBq of caesium-137 and 0.74 EBq of strontium-90.[4] For comparison, the Chernobyl disaster released 0.085 EBq of caesium-137, a much smaller amount and over thousands of square miles. (The total Chernobyl release is estimated between 5 to 12 EBq of radioactivity, however essentially only caesium-134/137 [and to a lesser extent, strontium-90] contribute to land contamination because the rest is too short-lived). The sediment of the lake bed is estimated to be composed almost entirely of high level radioactive waste deposits to a depth of roughly 11 feet (3.4 m).

The radiation level in the region near where radioactive effluent is discharged into the lake was 600 r√∂ntgens per hour (approximately 6 Sv/h) in 1990, according to the Washington, D.C.-based Natural Resources Defense Council,[5][6] sufficient to give a lethal dose to a human within an hour. ""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution_of_Lake_Karachay

""The pollution of Lake Karachay is connected to the disposal of nuclear materials from Mayak. Among workers, cancer mortality remains an issue.[5] By the time Mayak's existence was officially recognized, there had been a 21% rise in cancer cases, a 25% rise in birth defects, and a 41% rise in leukemia in the surrounding region of Chelyabinsk.[6] By one estimate, the river contains 120 million curies of radioactive waste.[7]""

Hanford, Washington is nearly as bad but the US took moderately more precautions so its mostly contained in leaky tanks. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hanford-nuclear-cleanup-problems/

Yes, hanford is weapons waste, not nuclear power reactor waste, but the exact same chemical processes are used to extract usable isotopes from spent fuel for use in new power plants, vs bombs (you just leave the fuel in a reactor shorter for weapons, that way Pu240 does not build up too much, and Pu240 complicates weapons design).

Not only does reprocessing make nuke waste more easily spread in the environment, it also is a weapons proliferation risk; any facility doing reprocessing for power reactors can easily use the same equipment for extraction of weapons grade plutonium. The US banned domestic reprocessing specifically to slow the spread of the tech to countries that would use it for weapons programs.

And after all that, reprocessed fuel is more expensive than fresh, so there is no economic incentive to use spent fuel if new is cheaper. Rokkasho in Japan is the only large scale civil fuel reprocessing plant where costs are fully available. Hanford, Mayak, Sellafield, La Hague are all so involved with the weapons industries over their history that costs are impossible to find, and more outdated designs than Rokkasho anyway. Rokkasho has not even opened yet and its lifecycle costs are estimated at over 106B.

So lets be clear about this, the German Childhood Cancer Registry has found that there is a significantly increased risk for children under five years of age to contract leukaemia the nearer they live to a nuclear power plant. The German Federal Office for Radiation Protection formally confirmed these findings, stating that ‚Äòin the vicinity of nuclear power plants, an increased risk of 60 per cent was observed for all types of childhood cancer, and for childhood leukaemia the risk doubled equaling a risk increase of approximately 100 per cent‚Äô.

With the attention to technical detail associated with Germany, the German government also appointed a multi-disciplinary Expert Group to assess the KiKK study findings. They concluded that ‚Äòthe study-design complies with the state-of-the-art of epidemiological science, the study is the methodically most elaborate and comprehensive investigation of this interrelation world-wide, and incidence risk has been sufficiently proved for Germany‚Äô. Further analysis of the KiKK study by the German Expert Group went on to state that childhood cancer near to nuclear power plant sites was actually underestimated by the KiKK researchers ‚Äì and so the risks are considerably above those reported.""

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/oeh.2009.15.3.318

""A government-sponsored study of childhood cancer in the proximity of German nuclear power plants (German acronym KiKK) found that children &lt; 5 years living &lt; 5 km from plant exhaust stacks had twice the risk for contracting leukemia as those residing &gt; 5 km. The researchers concluded that since ""this result was not to be expected under current radiation-epidemiological knowledge"" and confounders could not be identified, the observed association of leukemia incidence with residential proximity to nuclear plants ""remains unexplained."" This unjustified conclusion illustrates the dissonance between evidence and assumptions. There exist serious flaws and gaps in the knowledge on which accepted models for population exposure and radiation risk are based. Studies with results contradictory to those of KiKK lack statistical power to invalidate its findings. The KiKK study's ramifications add to the urgency for a public policy debate regarding the health impact of nuclear power generation.""

Coal provided such an amount to the East German economy it was politically untouchable at the time.

So Germany started replacing nuclear with renewables first, and now that the former DDR has a more diverse economy is able to work on phasing out coal too. ",Monaco,/r/europe/comments/ablwrv/germanys_energy_mix_keeps_getting_cleaner_as_coal/ed25oe4/,dongasaurus_prime,1546403196

2514,"I have to admit, our first arguing point is getting complicated and I've reread our comments many times and I'm still not able to follow right now.

As I understand it: accepting = from normal to accommodating, not accepting = the rest. And now as you made a point that cutting yourself has an effect, that _but_ evoked that's is some additional thought which was omitted; however, I'd argue that's already included and it plays a role whether is someone is accepted or not and tweaks the willingness.

---
&gt; Of course, what I meant is that while positive outcomes of dealing with this hypothetical Muslim are unlikely for you through the lens of their religion, there are other things you can miss out on.

You can miss out on a great person even without personal labels, e.g. very few people choose to go a place with drug injections and try to befriend people which happen to there.

I also still can't get rid of the impression because of you particular phrasing that you're trying to cherry-pick parts from a person while one has to deal with a whole person.

Further I'm not trying to make it a black and white thing, that's where the willingness comes in. I think the question is this: should one tweak willingness based on religious labels or not? You can miss out on in summary good persons as well as in summary bad persons (from your point of view). if the ratio is different for some subgroup of people it's optimal to change your willingness accordingly (you can't get to know all people and not to miss out anything).

&gt; I don't see why declaring one's self a member of a religion should cause such expectations.

You state a condition, there are associated conditional probabilities to it. And it is actual discrimination.

&gt; I label myself a Christian because I choose to follow Christianity (no particular denomination), but that hardly means I push my believes on others or am a religious fundamentalist.

Would you mind if I asked you a bit more personally, because that's a thing I don't quite understand. Why do you choose to follow Christianity but no particular denomination? If it is different from just being religious (~i.e. choose to follow your own thing), why that difference is important to you, why do you need that label?",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/abm04v/percentage_of_people_whod_be_willing_to_accept/ed1xh3n/,Goheeca,1546395661

2715,"&gt;we were the biggest power since the Roman empire.

Keep up. This is the comment I was answering to.

Let's say there is a war between England and Germany 1 vs 1 in 1898. There is absolutely no way England could have landed troops in Germany or conquered it. Some hegemonic power. 

Britain wasn't the biggest power in the world, an overinflated naval empire with little ability to do anything on land. Need I remind you that a tiny country like Belgium had a bigger output than the crown jewel of your empire, India with its 400 million people? And out of those 400 million people, how many actual effective soldiers could you muster? Just canon-fodder. The same applies to the second French colonial empire that owned half of Africa, give me a strong base in Europe over these useless empires that look good on modern maps. 

That's the whole reason why France + Britain+Belgium+Russia, owning 80% of the land in the world, were even against Germany and Austria, who had almost no colonial empire. 

So no, Britain was never a hegemonic power, although you might jerk yourself off at all the useless land you owned at the time.

Of course the Roman legionnaires were mostly foot soldiers with just a few horses for support. If they all had horses they had to have quite an extensive agricultural economy behind it to supply all that grain and still feed themselves.

Also, Germans killed everyone and burned all the villages below the Rhine, so I presume that's why these numbers are quite low.

You're right that it was not worth it for the Romans to conquer the Germans, but that was because they were fierce warriors (unlike the Gauls, which they managed to genocide and/or make submit to the Emperor).

It's almost creepy considering how much misery the euro has caused, and continues to cause, just to say ""yeah but traveling is nice"". It shows no regard for actual people's lives. The removal of a tiny inconvenience of the middle class is more important than the economic outlook of hundreds of millions of people.

First, the people in the government seized the oil production, but didn't give it to competent people who know something about oil production. Instead, they went with corruption and gave control to friends, family, and political allies, who are not competent and steal the revenue. On top of that, the price of oil has been unusually low for a few years now, which makes Venezuela's low grade oil much less lucrative. 

Second, the government has tried to set prices, which is a completely absurd and outrageously ignorant policy. If the forced price is below the cost of producing the product, the companies producing the product have to either go bankrupt, cut corners where-ever they can (product quality, wages, workers' conditions, ignoring environmental regulations etc.), or get their funding from somewhere else. If there is a government subsidy for them, they won't have to go under, but in such a case the price setting is useless, because the subsidy alone would've been enough to allow for cheaper products. Fixed prices don't solve economic problems, they make the markets struggle to adjust themselves to changes in demand. It would be far, far better policy to just give a bunch of free money to the people the prices were set for (presumably, the poor) and let the markets figure it out.

And third, they have hyperinflation due various reasons, such as the weak economy, and probably ignorant belief that printing more money somehow creates wealth. 

It Venezuela a failure because of socialism? No, because none of these policies are really necessary parts of socialism. But as is the case with many socialist countries, the people who seized power in the name of socialism tend to not actually believe in socialism and use it just to justify their power-grab and theft of the wealth of the country.

Yup.  Looks like Merriam purchased rights to the dictionary after Webster died, hence the modern Merriam-Webster.  And apparently Merriam referred to two people, not one.  Huh.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Webster

&gt;Noah Webster Jr. (October 16, 1758 ‚Äì May 28, 1843) was an American lexicographer, textbook pioneer, English-language spelling reformer, political writer, editor, and prolific author. He has been called the ""Father of American Scholarship and Education"". His blue-backed speller books taught five generations of American children how to spell and read. Webster's name has become synonymous with ""dictionary"" in the United States, especially the modern Merriam-Webster dictionary that was first published in 1828 as An American Dictionary of the English Language.

3079,"So building these fires on the beach was actually a safety compromise created by people who really didn‚Äôt understand the forces at play. 

I grew up here, about 4 blocks from the church you see in some of these pictures, and up until the 1990‚Äôs each little micro neighborhood organized our own fires. You have to realize Scheveningen was strangely isolated, especially in the old fishing village. Families knew each other going back hundreds of years. It was not unusual to see women in traditional [garb. ](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gymnopedie/9998851455) I went to school with people who had never left Scheveningen, never even took the tram to The Hague. The fires were a tradition going back generations, that played on all of that history. Come New Year there would be hundreds of fires, some as high as 10m, but most between 1 - 3m, at many intersections. People would enjoy their fire, wander to admire other people‚Äôs fires, share drinks and celebrate. Of course inherent in this was a competition to show who had the biggest and best fire. 

Neighborhood kids would collect whatever wood they could find. Starting mid December Kids go door to door asking for your Christmas trees - or at least ask you to promise to to give them to a rival group. A pile of old pallets and broken furniture would start growing in some dark corner of the local park in about November. People would take turns standing guard, because rival fire groups might raid, especially those assholes from Duindorp. Of course, we‚Äôd organize our own raids, because it‚Äôs important that Scheveningen build the biggest fires. 

Come NYE, it all got up at the narrow intersections and set it ablaze. 3 and 4 meter fires in pure residential areas were not unusual. I remember the year the fire over by the Chinese restaurant got so hot it broke all the windows. I remember the year it melted the paint on our front door. Of course, while this is going on, everyone, and I do mean everyone, is wandering around with a giant bag of fireworks they got from Poland while gleefully ignoring every safety precaution ever written. Point the firework at your head? Check! Put a bunch in beer bottles? Check! There was a guy who ‚Äúallowed‚Äù his Mercedes to get blown up every year - no idea what his insurance rates must have been like. 

Anyway, you get the idea; fire, gunpowder, chaos. We had friends visit one year who were coming from a war zone who said it reminded them of home. I think it was in anticipation (or dread) of 2000, that made the city decide to crack down. No more unsanctioned fires. Fires had to have a certain amount of clearance between the flames and the buildings. 

Naturally, there was resistance. On Dec 31 199_ the fire went up in front of the house as it normally did. But the city was wise to this, and had a fleet of dump trucks and bulldozers that roamed around scooping up the fires before they could be lit. The last minute scramble for wood was one of the moments I really saw everyone in the neighborhood work together, as we defied these stupid rules, and for the pride of Scheveningen rebuilt our fire! But even as we enjoyed our 3+ meter high blaze of coffee tables and a lounge chair, I think we all knew it was the end of an era.

Meanwhile, the fires in the designated spots were getting bigger. There had always been fires at those places, but now that all the small fires were gone, it wasn‚Äôt just showing your neighbors on the next block yours was bigger, it was neighborhood vs. neighborhood. So up, up, up they went. After it reached 100 feet, with the heat causing the tram lines to twist and bend, the city decided to move it to the beaches. Except now it was no longer neighborhood vs. neighborhood - now it‚Äôs Scheveningen vs. Duindorp, and that rivalry goes back ages. 

You see where this is going right? So now because they‚Äôre only building one fire, engineering it becomes critical. Random shaped wood won‚Äôt cut it, we need pallets that can be neatly stacked. Luckily, there‚Äôs a harbor, so plenty of those, but kids stop coming door to door to collect trees. The building of the fire has shifted from a kids of the neighborhood endeavor to something grown ups with machines build. There‚Äôs organization and structure and groups. And now it‚Äôs not just your 12 year old neighborhood pride at stake, it‚Äôs your dad‚Äôs 49 year old manhood, so up, up, up goes the pile. 

TL;DR The continued consolidate of NYE fires led to larger and larger fires.

Because all of a sudden the central bank cannot make 1 country's interests, but has to compromise between what dozens of countries want. This of course means that if one country's interests don't align with the rest of the EU, they're screwed. The BCE blackmails countries to align, mainly by taking public debt as hostage.

3132,"It is not just democracy, it is freedom, democracy, human rights, rule of law and a market economy ... that is much more that just ""will of the majority"", the EU project covers all these aspects together.

There is no automatism for throwing a member state out of the EU for unwarranted application of force. The problem in Catalonia is that two legal principles are in conflict: the territorial integrity of the state and the right of peoples to self-determination. Both rights are valid and need protecting. The EU approach to this is negotiation, the Spanish and Catalan governments should find a way to work it out ... and they did work it out, with a deal passed by both parliaments and there was peace. However, the previous right-wing government took the deal to the Constitutional Court which found it unconstitutional. The EU solution is such cases, where both parliaments have accepted a concept that is unconstitutional is to negotiate a constitutional amendment that satisfies both sides. This has not happened, which is why they have a mess.

With Serbia and Kosovo, Serbia no longer controls the territory and the majority there wants independence. It is necessary for Serbia and Kosovo to negotiate meaningful relations between them that include full minority rights. The EU has massive experience in this e.g. Northern Ireland and is able to help. The goal of Serbia should be EU membership for both Serbia and Kosovo, as this guarantees that Serbs in Kosovo will lead normal lives and be able to work culturally and economically with relatives and the motherland over the border.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/aap2gd/protests_in_belgrade_serbia_29122018/ed0guiq/,trisul-108,1546352305

3141,"&gt; That's cool to know. I was just now playing Apollo 11 in VR, and thought it was weird the instruments were showing me the height and velocity in feet.

In the early days of space exploration it was still customary
for {astro,cosmo}nauts to have a military aviation background.
Actually it was during the course of the Apollo program that
NASA chose to send actual scientists to go on the flights to
conduct experiments themselves. Initially they encountered
heavy resistance from the military crowd who thought it
undermined their value to the program:

&gt; Apollo‚Äôs final lunar mission [i. e. Apollo 17] took advantage of
&gt; behind-the-scenes lobbying by the lunar science community to
&gt; have a professional geologist visit the Moon. Many of the
&gt; astronauts, whose backgrounds were usually in the fighter-pilot
&gt; / test-pilot milieu, believed that a dangerous environment such
&gt; as an experimental spacecraft in the vicinity of the Moon was just
&gt; not the place to take someone who was not already inculcated
&gt; in the philosophies surrounding aviation.
&gt;
&gt; ‚Äî How Apollo Flew to the Moon, W. David Woods, p. 48

Thus it‚Äôs understandable that usability wise, the operating panel
for the AGC was designed to be handled intuitively by pilots. The
the scientists who later got on bord probably rolled their eyes

Orange and yellow areas are regions of high and low intensity lighting respectively that increased in brightness over the ten years. Grey areas are unchanged. Pale blue and dark blue areas are of low and high intensity lighting that decreased in brightness. Very dark blue areas were present in 1993 and had disappeared by 2003.

Would you care to expand on what's so great about this ?

Anyway, the Euro did not curtail those ""freedoms"" by itself. Is started with the Treaty of Rome, in 1957, starting the Common Market. Fluctuating national currencies proved to be a hindrance , specially after Nixon unilaterally decided to end the convertibility of USD to gold, in 1971.

The member states of the EEC responded by creating the *European Monetary System* in 1979, whereby they pledged to limit the fluctuations of their national currencies within a narrow band of ¬± %. They also introduced the ECU as an abstract currency unit, to ease the settlement of trade balances.

&gt;it allows the BCE/Germany to blackmail countries (they did it with Greece and Italy)

My take:
I don't know which part of their program could be described as libertarian, but I am not an expert. They advocate less regulation, more power for employers, but they are not alone, they overlap in this topic with conservative parties. In addition they advocated legalize marijuana and relax abortions laws. 

Couldn't resisted and looked on wiki history, discussion : Somebody added libertariansm  month ago, without discussion or new source, but discussion under SaS is old and barebone.

Sulik ( party chairman), in my opinion could be described as closet libertarian (maybe, I am not expert and I don't want  to delve in this topic), but much of libertarian policies - as I know it from US politics&amp;blogs -  are not marketable in Slovakia. Even the marijuana legalization is long run. So if Sulik become prime minister in next election (even if he win, it is not given) he will steer Slovakia politics more to the right spectrum, but chances that he introduce some libertarian program are slim.

China (or at least that business guy suggests this) is pretty much saying weaken your (negotiating) position and we will treat you as if you strengthened your position because we want to encourage others to weaken their position too.

The EU is negotiating from a position of strength aka representing the biggest market etc. As long as the UK is part of the EU, it shares that strength. The Chinese guy suggests that since China wants to encourage ppl leaving the EU it would treat such leavers beneficially. It seems pretty obvious why China would want to weaken the EU. It also seems pretty naive to think that once you've left the position of strength that the EU offers that China would treat you not only as if you still had that strength, but even better. For starters such behavior would antagonize the EU, which is  still a much more lucrative trading partner than whatever leaver could offer.

The EU parliament was very much in favour of intervening in Syria nearer the outbreak of the Syrian war in favour of the rebels. It was the UK parliament which voted against the action which subsequently led to Obama making a U turn on the policy too.

If you want to compete in the middle east with the likes of China and America then you need to support an integrated military.

3603,"&gt; Trump fired the first shot, 

This is a chicken and egg situation.  Trump was responding to a deal that he did not feel was good for America and he is not the one that made the original deal.  

As for "" Canada being forced to become a vassal state""  that just tells me that we have different ideas about what a vassal state is.  If you are curious ask the neighbors of China or Russia such as Ukraine, Georgia, Eastern Europe, Checknia etc or for China; Nepal or Tibet or India or all their neighbors around the South China Sea.  

This is a pet peeve or mine, I served in the Army along the DMZ and along the East/West German border and in Iraq.  I have seen first hand examples of how China and Russia deal with their neighbors.  

I also live about an hour from the US/Canada border,(which is the longest undefended border in the world), and no I do not think we bully Canada.  I think we are a very good neighbor compared to what we could be if we believed in might makes right.  I agree that might gives you certain capabilities but as a combat veteran I can tell you that no Canada is not treated harshly compared to how I see other countries operate.  

Just look at how the EU is screwing over the UK on Brexit.  I really don't see the US throwing its weight around as much as it could and frankly I would be outraged if we acted like the EU much less Russia or China.  

As for the current trade agreement, in the end Trump settled for no major gains from Canada.  The dairy thing was an irritant because the dispute was about a milk solids product used in cheese that did not even exist when NAFTA was negotiated and according to NAFTA it should have stayed tariff free.  In my opinion, Trumps main trade target is China but he has to address them on a global scale and yes that pulls other nations into it.  I voted against Trump but I have seen China cheating on trade and intellectual property for decades and listened to several presidents talk about doing something about China.  Trump is the first one I see actually doing stuff about China's trade abuses which again I think is the big picture on the trade situation.  

The US and Canada have been good neighbors for a long time and I do not see that changing from our side.  It is New Years so have a good night and I wish you and Canada well in the New Year.  ",,/r/europe/comments/ab63mw/brexit_us_ambassador_issues_trade_deal_warning_to/eczr36u/,Clacla11,1546316356

&gt;The rights of Englishmen are the perceived traditional rights of citizens of England. In the 18th century, some of the colonists who objected to British rule in the British colonies in North America argued that their traditional[1] rights as Englishmen were being violated. The colonists wanted and expected the rights that they (or their forebears) had previously enjoyed in England: a local, representative government, with regards to judicial matters (some colonists were being sent back to England for trials) and particularly with regards to taxation.[2] Belief in these rights subsequently became a widely-accepted justification for the American Revolution.[3][4]
&gt;
&gt;The American colonies had since the 17th century been fertile ground for liberalism within the center of European political discourse.[5] However, as the ratification of the Declaration of Independence approached, the issue among the colonists of which particular rights were significant became divisive. George Mason, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, stated that ""We claim nothing but the liberty and privileges of Englishmen in the same degree, as if we had continued among our brethren in Great Britain.""[4]",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/abe7r6/its_2019_and_still_this/eczsx4j/,vokegaf,1546318375

&gt;Swatch Internet Time (or .beat time) is a decimal time concept introduced in 1998 by the Swatch corporation as part of their marketing campaign for their line of ""Beat"" watches.
&gt;
&gt;Instead of hours and minutes, the mean solar day is divided into 1000 parts called "".beats"". Each .beat is equal to one decimal minute in the French Revolutionary decimal time system and lasts 1 minute and 26.4 seconds (86.4 seconds) in standard time. Times are notated as a 3-digit number out of 1000 after midnight. So, @248 would indicate a time 248 .beats after midnight representing 248/1000 of a day, just over 5 hours and 57 minutes.
&gt;
&gt;There are no time zones in Swatch Internet Time; instead, the new time scale of Biel Meantime (BMT) is used, based on Swatch's headquarters in Biel, Switzerland and equivalent to Central European Time, West Africa Time, and UTC+01. Unlike civil time in Switzerland and many other countries, Swatch Internet Time does not observe daylight saving time.

&gt;The Euro: Monetary Unity To Political Disunity?  
&gt;  
&gt; Aug 28, 1997  [ Milton Friedman ](https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/milton-friedman)  
&gt;  
&gt;SAN  FRANCISCO - A common currency is an excellent monetary arrangement under  some circumstances, a poor monetary arrangement under others. Whether  it is good or bad depends primarily on the adjustment mechanisms that  are available to absorb the economic shocks and dislocations that  impinge on the various entities that are considering a common currency.  Flexible exchange rates are a powerful adjustment mechanism for shocks  that affect the entities differently. It is worth dispensing with this  mechanism to gain the advantage of lower transaction costs and external  discipline only if there are adequate alternative adjustment mechanisms.     
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The United States is an  example of a situation that is favorable to a common currency. Though  composed of fifty states, its residents overwhelmingly speak the same  language, listen to the same television programs, see the same movies,  can and do move freely from one part of the country to another; goods  and capital move freely from state to state; wages and prices are  moderately flexible; and the national government raises in taxes and  spends roughly twice as much as state and local governments. Fiscal  policies differ from state to state, but the differences are minor  compared to the common national policy.    
&gt;  
&gt;Unexpected  shocks may well affect one part of the United States more than others  -- as, for example, the Middle East embargo on oil did in the 1970s,  creating an increased demand for labor and boom conditions in some  states, such as Texas, and unemployment and depressed conditions in  others, such as the oil-importing states of the industrial Midwest. The  different short-run effects were soon mediated by movements of people  and goods, by offsetting financial flows from the national to the state  and local governments, and by adjustments in prices and wages.  
&gt;  
&gt;By contrast, Europe‚Äôs common market exemplifies a situation that is  unfavorable to a common currency. It is composed of separate nations,  whose residents speak different languages, have different customs, and  have far greater loyalty and attachment to their own country than to the  common market or to the idea of ""Europe."" Despite being a free trade  area, goods move less freely than in the United States, and so does  capital.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The drive for the Euro has been motivated by politics not economics. The  aim has been to link Germany and France so closely as to make a future  European war impossible, and to set the stage for a federal United  States of Europe. I believe that adoption of the Euro would have the  opposite effect. It would exacerbate political tensions by converting  divergent shocks that could have been readily accommodated by exchange  rate changes into divisive political issues. Political unity can pave  the way for monetary unity. Monetary unity imposed under unfavorable  conditions will prove a barrier to the achievement of political unity.

3818,"&gt;I like to think that a nation in the EU has more rights than a state in the US however, especially since the UK applied to join, instead of what you propose of a crushing of economy until a forced annexation

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Uh.... have you seen how the EU treats Switzerland? The US does the same thing with Canada that the EU does with Switzerland. It's irrelevant how many rights a US state has compared to an EU state. That doesn't change the fact that we have both pooled our sovereignty together as states precisely so we can negotiate better deals with external parties, like Canada or Switzerland. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Personally, I'm on Canada's side here, but I'm over-dramatic. Canada was humiliated, like very rarely before in modern history.  
&gt;  
&gt;This  is the sort of thing which breaks trust and makes people hate you for a  while. It's why soft-power and diplomacy is important. Incidents like  these fester in the collective memory.

&amp;#x200B;

Canada has been afraid of the US for the last 150 years and Canada will continue to be afraid of the US no matter what the US does. They are insecure because they are so small and we are so big. There is nothing the US can do about that. 

&amp;#x200B;

The US isn't going to negotiate bad trade deals for American farmers because Canadians might complain about being bullied by the US. Especially when they complain about being bullied all the time anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;It just feels rich, considering the past two years of 'rhetoric' over 'globalist' and 'commie fascist EU' from the US.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think anyone has ever called the EU communist or fascist except some bizarre members of the alt-right, or Trump when he's saying something stupid. The far-right in Europe says much worse things about the EU than anyone in the US says about the EU. Most people in the US don't ever talk about the EU or really know what it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I do mind them being *hypocritical and loud jerks*  about it however. In fact, I think Americans should be even more pissed  at their leaders than anyone else. The U.S has signed almost no new  trade deals since 2016, just renegotiated, whereas most other nations  are scrambling to go around them. It's outright self-sabotage.

Yeah, I am pissed about it. But I don't think it actually makes much difference because I do not believe that the US and EU could negotiate a trade deal no matter who the US president was. There are serious trade and regulatory differences that we can't bridge. I'm more upset with Trump for pulling out of the Asian trade deal with Japan. 

&amp;#x200B;

But then, he did negotiate a better deal with Canada and Mexico. So you have to take a win where you can find one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;People  don't like being humiliated, and the current loud and public approach  that the US has is less a trade deal, than a capitulation. This is why  trade deals are behind closed doors.

&amp;#x200B;

The Canadian deal was negotiated behind close doors. Canada wasn't being humiliated until they started being overdramatic and making a big deal out of everything. The actual changes to NAFTA were small and in a few sectors that Trump wanted to renegotiate, so that just explains how overdramatic and silly the Canadians were being. 

&amp;#x200B;

Canada acts overdramatic as a negotiating point. It isn't to be taken seriously. ",,/r/europe/comments/ab63mw/brexit_us_ambassador_issues_trade_deal_warning_to/eczcim0/,sandyhands2,1546302150

3840,"Looking at this map it basically confirms to me that French is an increasingly irrelevant language. 

Also im sorry but Canada really shouldnt be all blue, it should be green, as outside of Quebec, Canada is not a French speaking country at all. The further west you go French basically plummits off a cliff to the point where its not a part of the people's lifes/culture/history in any way at all. It doesnt exist basically. Its not commonlly heard or spoken in Canada outside of one province in the East. And the only reason French is recognised as an official language in Canada is to simply pander to and gain the votes of the Quebecois, by keeping them happy and on side of the ruling elites in Ontario(the other power centre of the country). So in effect Quebec they basically are over-represented in the federal government and have a disproportionate amount of political power over the rest of the country etc just cuz... That's what it boils down to.


Also I mean the fact is if Canada had let nature take its course, the French language in Canada would've naturally died out and gone existinct ages ago. It still will mind you, but it'll take a bit longer due to artificial laws and policies to try to save it etc.. But ultimately you cant save that which is already dead.

- Sweden has a new election and the Sweden Democrats end up supporting the government.

- France enters recession, putting the final nail in the coffin of Macron's popularity. French protests resume, dragging France in to further chaos.

- Germany avoids recession, but the French chaos takes the shine off of Merkel's successor and the CDU in general as they are tainted by association.

- German Greens do not actually collapse. Nor does the AfD.

- Spain has an election. It's a rout for PP and Podemos, whilst PSOE and Ciudidanos gain. But the balance is made by VOX, which propels the Spanish right in to government.

- Italy either enters recession or remains stagnant. This damages m5s but not Lega. Lega dumps m5s for its natural allies on the right after a new election. Because the budget deficit from the latest budget is only 2.4% the markets do not enter crisis mode.

- Belgian Federal election makes government formation impossible. Flemish independence movement begins to flare up. N-VA and Vlaams Belang fight for the soul of the Flemish right, whilst the Flemish Greens steadily grow.

- Danish general election produces a disappointing result for the right, which retains a knife-edge lead in the election.

- European parliamentary elections are tainted by Macron's problems. ALDE actually ends up losing seats. GUE-NGL, Greens and ENF all win, with ENF the biggest winners. EFDD manage to not die. ECR stays still. S&amp;D devastated. ECR devastated. Pall over Europe.

- Estonian election is a big win for EKRE. ALDE parties win overall.

- Finnish parliamentary election ends up not being the bust for the PS, who end up at 10%. SDP wins.

**Act I**

Anxious over the looming Brexit deadline, Nicola Sturgeon calls a meeting of all pro-independence political parties to determine the best course of action. They meet on March 1st, hoping that they can hash out a way to stop Brexit within the next month. Days go by, then weeks, as Nicola's hopes turn to despair. That is, until March 21st when a late-night guest knocks on her chamber door.

‚ÄúPatrick, whit ur ye daein' haur?‚Äù exclaims Nicola.
‚ÄúTh‚Äô grin is soft, Nicola,‚Äù replies Green party MSP Patrick Harvie, ‚Äúuir plan can finally gang intae motion.‚Äù

Perplexed, Nicola asks ‚Äúwhit th‚Äô buck ur ye talking‚Äô abit, Patrick?‚Äù
‚ÄúFollaw me,‚Äù says Patrick, mysteriously.

Nicola follows Patrick to his Prius where he tells her to get in. ‚ÄúWa, whaur ur we gonnae?‚Äù asks Nicola, ‚ÄúSooth,‚Äù replies Patrick, ‚Äútroost me, Nicola."" Reluctantly, she gets in and they hit the road.

After 6 hours of driving, the little Prius drives by a place well-known to both passengers. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre passin‚Äô sooth ay th‚Äô wall‚Ä¶‚Äù whimpers Nicola. ‚ÄúAh ken, we main gang tae whaur th' grin is soft‚Äù replies Patrick, ‚Äúwa diz it matter if th' grin is soft?‚Äù asks Nicola, to no response.

16 more silent hours pass until the duo finally makes it to their destination.

‚ÄúLondon?‚Äù asks Nicola. ‚ÄúOch aye‚Äù replies Patrick, his voice as heavy as a claymore, ‚Äúwe‚Äôve come tae meit uir maker.‚Äù

‚ÄúTh‚Äô Sassenach didne make us,‚Äù scoffed Nicola, ""Th' Scottish waur a prood, independent fowk lang afair th' Sassenach cam aboot.‚Äù ‚ÄúNae th‚Äô Sassenach, uir savioor,‚Äù replies Patrick, ‚Äúin th‚Äô soft grin.""

The pair walk up to a quaint pub. The sign reads ‚ÄúTh‚Äô Highlander‚Äù. Patrick leads Nicola into the dimly lit where they meet Mr. Gilwill.

‚ÄúWelcome Mr. Harvie, we have two rooms prepared for ye,‚Äù booms Mr. Gilwill. Mr Gilwill corrects himself ‚ÄúI mean, rooms for you both.‚Äù ‚ÄúSpick Scots ye traitur!‚Äù screams Nicola.

""Haud yer sheesht, they dornt ken thes is a Scottish pub,‚Äù whispered Patrick, ‚ÄúThank you, kind sir we would love to stay in this fine establishment,‚Äù says Patrick, Englishly.

They carried the luggage I forgot to write about earlier to their rooms. Exhausted from the long drive, Nicola and Patrick fell asleep in their respective rooms.

The clock struck 2am and Mr. Gilwill woke our heroes. ‚ÄúTh‚Äô pub is closed,‚Äù said Mr. Gilwill, ‚Äúth‚Äô ritual main begin.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhit ritual?‚Äù asked Nicola, ‚Äúye Greens ur a bampot.""

Patrick sighed, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonnae St. James‚Äôs park. Troost me.‚Äù Reluctantly, Nicola walked with Patrick and Mr. Gilwill to St. James‚Äôs park.

Upon arriving at the park, they were met with a circle of hooded men chanting in an incomprehensible language. ‚ÄúFa ur these fowk?‚Äù asked Nicola, ‚Äúan‚Äô wa ur they chantin‚Äô in Scottish?‚Äù

Patrick explained, ‚ÄúIn 1603, th' scottish kin' Jimmy VI becam kin' ay th' Sassenach an' Irelain an aw. He ordered thes royal park be renovated,‚Äù Patrick paused, ‚Äúan', as th' kin' ay Scootlund, he decreed 'at Scotland‚Äôs greatest hero receife a proper burial.""

‚ÄúYe pure techt‚Ä¶,‚Äù asked Nicola, ‚Äúoch aye,‚Äù interrupted Patrick, ‚ÄúWilliam Wallace is buried in thes park.""

Patrick went on. ‚ÄúTh‚Äô Green ceilidh has assembled uir finest druids.‚Äù ‚ÄúAn‚Äô ye hunk he‚Äôll come back?‚Äù asked Nicola.

I have to say that from years ago Granada seems forgotten to Central government. They hasn't a railway connection because there is a plan to switch from Cercanias to AVE which lives the city in a limbo.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm not sure is Granada has a metro.

Anyway, you can get more info about spanish railroad systems which as another countries, some Metropolitan Areas mixing Metro+Tram+Cercanias.

The City always was in favour of remaining because the smart money always knew where it's coming from. And the City's global importance comes from the fact that it's basically Europe's trading and clearing hub. Cut it off from the Continent and you've got a problem on your hands. 

Claiming the City to be a strong point in any negotiations is a double-edged sword, because as soon as you play that card and someone calls you out on it, you're done.

&gt;**Has the channel between England and France ever been so frozen that you could walk across it?**
&gt;
&gt; It may have done. At several times in the seventeenth century, there seems to have been only a couple of miles of open sea between Dover and Calais. This is attested by a number of witnesses, and its possible that the ice may have, unobserved or unrecorded, have completely covered the Straits of Dover at some stage. Here are two accounts
&gt;
&gt;&gt;In 1684 the frost was so severe that nearly all the birds perished; the Thames was covered with ice eleven inches thick; at a fair held upon it, printing-presses were erected which struck off verses and inscriptions commemorative of the event, several of which memorials are still extant. A private letter of the date of February the 9th of that year, mentions the appearance of a great deal of ice in the Channel, adding that it was reported that the ice between Dover and Calais was within about a league of joining.

&gt;&gt;Loving Cossin,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;... The frost broke w'th us last tuesday, which being more noteable than any since the memory of man, take a small account as followeth: the first Instant Mr. Shoesmith told me that the tide for some dayes had not been seen to flow neer folstone [Folkestone] towne by 3 leagues, by Reason of the Ice which lay there; that the Ice lay some miles off in the sea ag'st Romny [Romney], and that there was uppon the topp of the Steeples to be seen and [sic] Islands of Ice, one the West of the Light many miles long; but the next day, when I was at the Light, I took a boat-hook in my hand, and seeing the Ice lying soe thick I went on till I was about 2 rods uppon the sea, so far that Thomas Smith judged there was 3 faddom of water undr me; if I had been there at full sea (which was an hour or more before) I might have gone out a mile, the flakes joyned so close together, and where I put my staf between them I felt Ice underneath. This was, as old Quick judges, about a league in breadth ag'st the poynt, but at farly poynt it seemed to be at least 3 leagues; in length it was as far as I could see from East to West, and 'tis verily believed was the same from dover to the land's end. Old Quick observed some flakes to begin to come about 12 days before from the Eastward, which increased every day, and upon the fall of the tide went always toward the West, w'ch by Reason of the wind never return'd again. About 2 houres after I was uppon it, I observed that when the wind and tide went together, then all the Ice moved as fast as I could ride foot pace along by the side of it, and did drive most part of it from the shore directly towards beachy poynt [Beachey Head]. I judg it must come from holland or other eastern p'ts, w'ch by Reason of a continued eastally wind was brought this way. A great deale of it remanes yett to be seen in the sea, but not soe much but that the vessells now pass againe, which was more (as I was told) then the pecquet boats did for some weeks. ...

3984,":/ Yeah, conspiracies are a plague these days. The anti-vaxx stuff is just ridiculous. I recently read up on how the Italian government actually put that into policy this fall, then the results were so atrocious that they actually (we're talking about demagogues here) reversed their message/disinformation a mere couple of months later. And someone's actually voting for all these types, who'd endanger whomever as long as it serves their political goal of more power. 

Tbh, the Kremlin explanation seems to hold the most water. As careful and critical as I am with political documentaries, the ""Active Measures"" one that came out this year painted a pretty scary picture of exactly that explanation, and all the history on the Ukraine, Georgia, and what's being reported on the 2016/Brexit interference, I haven't found a single thing so far (on that part) that doesn't check out (unfortunately?).

I'm suddenly considering if this means we may actually go back to phrases like ""3rd world countries"" - maybe it's too early to tell how the cold war ends.   

p.s. I mean ""Xth world countries"" as phrases originating from the cold war; not as any kind of a ranking or other such nonsense.

Sales of internal combustion engine cars in 2018 are unlikely to be surpassed in any future year, as demand in the world‚Äôs three largest markets stalls and carmakers seek to ramp up production of electric cars.

‚ÄúWe will probably see the peak of combustion engine car sales in 2018 based on global sales through October, plus estimates for November and December,‚Äù said Felipe Munoz, global automotive analyst at Jato Dynamics, a supplier of automotive data. ‚ÄúAt the beginning of the year we had a more optimistic perspective for the global market. This has changed in the last six months.‚Äù

That idea that combustion engines would be displaced by ‚Äúzero emission‚Äù technology has become mainstream in recent years, but predictions at the start of 2018 generally held that demand would keep growing until 2022 or later. 

Selling combustion engine cars to customers ‚Äî this will not grow in the future
Axel Schmidt, global automotive lead at Accenture However, the global car market in recent months has been characterised as ‚Äúdisastrous‚Äù by one analyst and a ‚Äúnightmare‚Äù by another, owing to the US-led trade war, Brexit, financing issues among Chinese consumers, the embargo on Iran and new emissions targets in Europe.
Although 2018 sales are likely to be slightly higher than a year before ‚Äî Moody‚Äôs is projecting growth of 0.2 per cent to 95.5m ‚Äî demand has been shrinking since the summer in the three biggest markets, namely China, the EU and the US. 

‚ÄúWhen you look at 2018 since the summer, new car sales in all of the important markets are going down,‚Äù said Axel Schmidt, global automotive lead at Accenture. ‚ÄúSelling combustion engine cars to customers ‚Äî this will not grow in the future.‚Äù

Evercore ISI is projecting total sales to fall by 0.6 per cent in 2019, while Morgan Stanley sees a 1 per cent fall in automotive production, which would be the first decline in nine years.
A cyclical peak in car sales is different from an all-time peak. What makes the present situation unique is that even if overall car sales pick up slightly in 2019 or 2020, electric cars are predicted to grow fast enough to shrink the portion of combustion engines sold.

Under Moody‚Äôs projections, global car sales will grow by 1.2 per cent in 2019 to 96.6m cars. Electrified vehicle sales are expected to grow by 1.5m units next year, according to AlixPartners, a consultancy. That would be 1.6 per cent of added market share next year ‚Äî which implies the pie will shrink for combustion engines.

In China, the world‚Äôs biggest car market, growth in the market for combustion engine cars has already stalled, while demand for electric cars is accelerating.

Alternative-fuel car sales, by contrast, nearly doubled from 405,000 to 793,000.

China is the wild card for whether the combustion engine will grow in 2019. Barclays projects Chinese car sales will rebound by 4.7 per cent, which could be enough to extend global sales of combustion engine cars. But the forecast is predicated on government stimulus that most analysts no longer expect.

He's been on it since the 1980s, for whatever reason, so it's highly likely that his stance toward German car manufacturers resides on a psychological level and there's not that much to be done about it. 

But it doesn't matter all that much anyhow. The real elephant in the room isn't German cars, it's forcing open the EU's agricultural market, where Trump actually *has* a point since the EU has a way of erecting non-tariff barriers for food, largely due to French and Italian pressure. Germany has been supporting them forever, but not out of self-interest. If Trump can trade in German support for not doing anything with cars, he has a win, since he has to open up new markets for US agribusiness anyway.

4306,"There are currently 12 reprocessing plants in the world, with another one being build (in Russia) and one going online soon (in Japan). With the exception of Japan, all reprocessing plants that ever existed were either small scale research plants or used by nuclear powers to harvest plutonium. There have been plenty of feasibility studies that came to the conclusion that reprocessing is simply more expensive than the one-use cycle, which is why you barely see them build without military involvement - its simply too costly. In the end, only about 1/3rd of fuel is actually reprocessed, and this number is projected to go down since the new reprocessing plants wont be able to keep up with the increasing fission plants. 

Another issue is that of the 96% uranium in nuclear waste only about 1% are feasible to use again (after enrichment), so you end up with mostly unusable uranium. The biggest usage of reprocessing is in the harvesting of plutonium - since a reprocessing plant could significantly contribute to nuclear weapons proliferation you wont see them outside of nuclear superpowers and some select, trusted states.

4319,"The healthiest way is to conduct a census but that is very expensive, thus a cheaper way is preferred; survey. The difference is in census you ask every individual in a country (millions of people), and in survey you ask to some individuals that are selected randomly (thousands of people).

You have a budget to conduct a survey. It has major effect on the approximation of the results.

You need to determine the [sample size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination). If you want a greater confidence interval you need bigger sample size. If the sample size is too big you will be out of budget. Bigger the sample size better the confidence interval.

A country is divided into states or cantons or districts. But generally statisticians divide a country into [statistical regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUTS_statistical_regions_of_Turkey) that may or may not overlap with governmental districts. These statistical regions are fuhrer divided into sub-regions and so on.

At the smallest sub-region let's say you want to select 12 people randomly (because it has population of 12000, but if it had population of let's say 15000 you would select accordingly; 15 random samples). Further more you may want to divide this sample size into 2 groups; males and females. Or may be you can divide it into age groups. But dividing into professions would lead to bias. Thus we select these samples randomly.

What is [random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_randomness)? It is hard topic. It is a very big topic. Computers are not good random generator. Best random generator use at least 2 independent sources such as radiation and noise to generate random numbers but these are not completely random too.

Using a random number generator you select sample individuals randomly from let's say their neighborhood. The samples in the neighborhood should be proportional to the population. And then you make a visit to their home. Cheaper alternative could be calling by phone. It is not good survey if you conduct the survey in the street because then the survey would be [biased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias). And it would not be random but haphazard. We don't want [haphazard](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/haphazard-sampling/) sampling!

Random sampling is very important in order not to face with things like this; ""If you ask 100 educated people you will get different statistics then asking 100 peasants"".

And of course they are many other things that needs to be done for the survey but it is a very detailed and a long list.

At the end you get something like. With sample size of 1230 people out of 12300000 population size we predict with with 95% confidence and 2% error that 60% of people will say ""blah"", 20% will say ""whoo?"", and the rest will say ""nah"".",Turk from Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/ab0j9k/almost_half_of_europeans_dont_know_that_meps_are/ecy19kq/,darkhorn,1546265869

4355,"&gt; How is politics a minor point in this conversation?
    
Because it is not the main reason why Dutch people want to stay, and the reasons why Dutch people want to remain are not relevant to this thread anyway. I only pointed out how many of the factors for leaving named in the article are also present in the Netherlands. Yet support for the EU is higher in the Netherlands than many other EU countries.
    
&gt; this is a major difference between the UK and apparently the Netherlands, the end all be all of government is not economic advancement.
    
That was not what I said. I said that the purpose of the EU is mostly economical for the Netherlands. The UK is actually very similar as they are also more interested in trade benefits than in political federalization when it comes to the EU. The lack of a desire to influence other countries is not evidence that a country only cares about the economy.
     
&gt; The UK for a long time was used by other countries in the EU to argue their political case, I don't know why you seem surprised that we feel the EU is not politicly beneficial for us when we are used to fight your battles which you do not want to fight out of fear.
    
That is a very cynical way to view things. The countries that view the EU as mainly economical do lose a political ally with brexit, but that does not mean that those countries were somehow exploiting the UK. In fact, the UK also benefited from the support of those countries. Your statement is essentially: ""we feel the EU is bad because we had political allies that agreed with us"".   
     
&gt; The sole purpose of the EU is to influence other countries, secondly, the reason rich countries are rich is because they can influence other nations / the world.
     
The purpose is to reduce non-tariff trade barriers by harmonizing regulations. Which is very beneficial for the economy. ",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/aazzcv/why_britain_decided_to_leave_the_eu_but_other/ecy1lt5/,DomesticatedElephant,1546266230

Exactly the attitude I was talking about. You can say this about any country Russia attacks. ""What happens in [Romania, Estonia, Latvia, pick any EE country] is a thing between [...] and Russia.

Please... there were lots of injustice done to EE countries post WW2 untill USSR colapsed. A LOT. And to some other countries even after. But fuck them. Lets swallow poor Russia's propaganda. Which is exactly what you did.

Is abusing its power to conquer some neighbors. Thats what it does.

some of which were colonists moved post WW2 over the bodies of initial inhabitants who were sent to gulags. They can go fuck themselves to Russia right away .

4426,"&gt;Great point and lets not forget that the system of individual protections which slowly evolved in Britain over centuries have become the benchmarks for civil rights around the globe. 

No. They evolved in Europe (incl. UK) and the US. Hard to argue Rousseau, Montesquieu, Kant and Jefferson had no major influence on this. And the signature English thinker, John Locke himself, could only publish/live in the Dutch Republic until the Glorious Revolution, banished from your oh-so-liberal England. Liberalism is not a British invention, despite its enormous (and probably biggest) contributions to it.

&gt;The rule of law, an independent juridiciary, trial by jury, habeaus corpus and private property rights are some of the great contributions this Isle made to the rest of the world. 

I think you are partially correct here, with the connotation that these developed independently in other places in Europe too - think of the modern Germanic (Germany/Low Countries) idea of a Rechtstaat, Switzerland's political history, the Nordic Viking assemblies or Renaissance Italy.

&gt;This is important because it contradicts the remainer view that our rights are somehow guaranteed by being the member of the EU. If they ever picked up a history book they would realise that most of Europe, barring a handful of noble exceptions, have lived in despotisms well up to modern times. 

*Including England*. It is a farce to think of England as anything less than a despotic monarchy or better, a despotic oligarchy until the mid 19th or even early 20th century. Virtually all the people who died in WWI never had been allowed any say in politics. You would realise this too if you picked up your history book, before lecturing others on it.

4500,"&gt; Did I say import everything from Norway? No. Import part of it. There is a new pipeline being built from Norway to Poland now for example. 

Germany is already importing part of it's supply from Norway, Russia is only 40%. Less than Poland is importing from Russia. But we need a solution for ALL of Europe. If we wanted to, we could out compete Poland in the price for Norway's natural gas easily and meet OUR demand by sucking up its entire supply. We need to think 30 years in to the future when it comes to energy.

&gt; Nuclear power is better than renewable 

Nuclear power is not better than renewables. It actually suffers from the same category of problems as them.

For that, you just have too look at France, if it weren't for imports from neighboring countries there would have been brown-outs in 2 winters in the last decade, because for every degree the temperature drops it required 2.3GW of addition electricity for heating (or about 1 additional nuclear power plant)

As the costs are mostly from construction, the most economical way to run a NPP is to let it run at it's max output all the time. That's evident from Hinkley Point C with a construction cost of 20 billion and a guaranteed sales price of 10 cents per kWh.

If you build more NPPs to supply peak demand, that NPP will have to increase it's sales price accordingly. If it runs at 50% capacity on average, you would need to charge 20 cents. Which is economically impossible.

For the same money as 1 Hinkley Point C, you can build 10 or 20 times as much capacity in natural gas power plants.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/aaylva/germany_would_oppose_new_nuclear_missiles_in/ecxrao9/,Alcobob,1546251222

The leave campaign focused heavily on the migration crisis and the need for the UK to have control of their own borders.   
The UK people voted for leave after that campaign (which, again, focused heavily on border security).   

Now you claim it wasn't about the borders at all.   

Can you support your claim that the leave voters didn't vote for leave because of border security? The way the leave campaign ran, it sure sounded like it was about that. Was there a different referendum I missed where people rejected the notion that it was about the border?      

You can't unilaterally decide that the issue the leave campaign focused most on is suddenly no longer the major issue defining Brexit.    

And if the border issue wasn't all that much of an issue anyway then the Irish border issue wouldn't be an issue at all. If free movement of people and goods should continue after Brexit then there's no reason for a border there (something the EU would be fine with). It's the UK that no longer wants free movement of people and goods which is why there's the Irish border issue in the first place. Because we can't have restrictions on goods and people while also having no border between Northern Ireland and Ireland unless we de facto put Ireland outside of the EU's customs union as well.

4623,"Alright i'll bite, in the first point he makes.

***From the turn of the century onwards, you have this extraordinary rise  of the idea of England as a political community \[ie, a popular desire  for England-only legislation voted on by English-only politicians\]. All  the public opinion surveys show this.***

For starters i would love to see the ""public opinion surveys"" he's referring to, the concept of English-only legislation being voted on by English-only politicians is not a main stream policy, UKIP played around with it but unfortunately their one MP was unable to implement it. He's pushing the o-so-tired narrative that Brexit is actually just some pointless exercise in nationalism, it's a great line, it lets you distract from any actual criticism and push this false narrative that really Brexit is just an English thing (ignore all the people who voted for it in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) and they are just doing it because they are secret nationalists.

It's a straw man because the type of ""English nationalism"" he claims exists is not even remotely mainstream nor was the concept of England as an individual country becoming more independent of the rest of the UK even a topic of discussion during the referendum. Describing it as the ""ghost in the machine"" is blatantly false, the driving forces behind Brexit were in no way linked to some mythological resurgence in English nationalism, [here's a you gov survey taken after the Brexit vote](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/7lnxwjw12j/BBC_EnglishIdentity_March18_Results_for_website.pdf), more English people identify as British than English. [Here's a paper by Warrick university](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/centres/cage/manage/publications/305-2016_becker_fetzer_novy.pdf) that atempts to identfy the ""reasons behind Brexit"", there are numerous, they are complex, none of them are some latent English only nationalism.

&amp;#x200B;

***It comes originally from Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson, this mad  idea that somehow the 100 years war shows the English capacity to throw  off feudal vassalage. It‚Äôs a ludicrous misunderstanding of history.***

So i can't find Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg mentioning the 100-year war in a public statement so tempted to call a straw man here, but they could have said that somewhere so I'll instead pick up his second straw man in one paragraph his apparent ""disdain"" for the vassalage term being used. See this is a straw man because, as i suspect he knows perfectly well, the actual term that MPs use is vassal state that is used in common English much more widely than to just refer to its feudalistic root, the context that MPs used it means to be in a servant or subordinate position.

Again straw man, he's creating a fictitious scenario, in this case stating that backbench MPs are claiming we will be feudal tenants of Europe which is factually false, their use of the term Vassal state in line with modern usage of the word vassal and came about criticizing Theresa Mays deal not criticizing our previous relationship with the EU, no serious politican ever claimed we were a vassal state under the pevious arrangement with the EU beacuse that statement would be wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

***Because originally the thing that characterised heroic failure in the  English imagination was not self-pity, but Brexit is full of hysterical  self-pity.***

So at this point hes just purposfully throwing out insults, he makes the assertion that heroic defeat is used as an overarching construct in British schools to detract away from the bad stuff the British empire did. I went to a British school and the bad stuff was not glossed over, neither was the good stuff, generally i think British school children who study the British empire gain a fairly balanced view. To be blunt trying to debate an Irishman about the British empire rarely leads to an impartial evaluation.

The strawman here is two fold, he's making the claim British children are taught the Empires history through material designed to mislead about the negatives, that's not true. I'm not sure what hysterical self pity is but considering half of Paris is currently on fire i don't think we are quite as hysterical as one might think.

***There‚Äôs no doubt that Germany is the major power in Europe, and that‚Äôs  one of the things going on with Brexit. It‚Äôs this idea that this country  we defeated twice in the 20th century is now seen as the dominant  power. That leads to fantasies that Britain really lost the war and  we‚Äôre being taken over insidiously by the Germans.***

This answer frankly goes beyond a strawman and is just straight up decieit to push his viewpoint. No British person i know views Germany as this antagoistic enemy nor is there any animosity towards Germany because we were at war with them. Nazism was and is a disgusting belief system, we beat it. The Germany of today is nothing like that and I have yet to see any public opinion poll or reputable study that remotely suggests that we view Germany as insidious or as anything other than a close ally.

I would even question if we view the EU as insidious, They have always been fairly open that their desire is a move towards a federal Europe, a lot of people may disagree with that but I certaintly haven't felt they were somehow trying to steal power, power was given to them freely and openly via agreements the UK made.

&amp;#x200B;

***I‚Äôm increasingly convinced that there will be a second referendum. The  Sherlock Holmes principle is always a good one: you eliminate the  impossible and whatever remains, however improbable, must be the  solution. The second referendum has always been highly improbable but  everything else is looking impossible. There‚Äôs just no deal that the  Europeans can do that can get through the House of Commons. And no deal  is so catastrophic that you have to hope that no sane parliament would  allow it. So the one thing left is a second referendum.***

I actually agree that a peoples vote (second referendum) is the logical choice however since we are on the hunt for strawman arguments this is again one that has to be pointed out, a no deal is absolutely not impossible, in-fact some political commentators believe it to be the most probable.

I don't actually dislike Fintan O'Toole, he's a good journalist and honestly I would think his book isn't intended to be a netural balanced look at Brexit so attacking him for that would be unfair (and ironically a strawman).

Denmark and The Netherlands that you take as example have higher GDP per capita than the UK. Even though GDP per capita doesn't say everything, the UK definetely isn't ""richer"" than one of those said countries.

The president‚Äôs power over domestic policy may be comparatively constrained, but it is still substantial. I think only Americans should have the power to elect the person who is given the nearly unilateral ability to decide whether or not a bill is made into law. I think only Americans should be able to choose the person who fills our executive agencies and federal judiciary. 

It‚Äôs the same reason that a resident of New Jersey doesn‚Äôt get a say in any local or statewide positions in New York even though New York‚Äôs policies can have an effect on New Jersey. Even if it doesn‚Äôt always work, it encourages people to look at candidates holistically. And at the very least, single-issue voting Americans still have to deal with any consequences of bad policies at home, and maybe they‚Äôll change their vote in the future.

1, is there a question to be asked that a lot of the current huge US tech firms have overly focused on the current tech scene, internet 1.0 if you will and have not focused on what happens next....just look at facebook. 
A few years back facebook was involved with what seemed some next gen research in robotics, quantum computing ect, they were R&amp;D etc a lot....now it seems they are stagnating a bit with their legal and ethical woes and a lot of that future research has gone a bit quiet.....
I'd not betting against FB going away in the decade ahead.

Google/Alphabet had a smaller but similar issue. they bought Boston dynamic (an innovative, but I'd argue not the kill all competitors their bots are so much better behemoth some made them out to be)
What did Alphabet do....sold them to Softbank, something I think we'll look back on in decades ahead as one of those ""what were they thinking!"" moments in technology.

2, the next revolutions in ""tech"" robotics, biotech, etc etc....there doesn't seem to be overly dominant US/Chinese giants just crushing all...hell a European company, Bayer, just finished buying the US giant agri biotech big boy Monsanto...
You could even say Bayer is a tech company now as they control the 2 most used farm big data/farmer digital interface system, Xarvio in EU, Fieldview in the US....two technology fields that will only increase in value goign forward.

What I think I'm saying is, the future isn't set in stone with the winners being crowned for all time...

Another and probably the biggest problem: loose nukes. Most ex-Soviet countries in 1990s were in chaos, with underfunded military and extreme corruption. The more owners, the higher is the chance of nuclear weapons finding their way to the black market. A lot of conventional Soviet weapons did, [with Ukraine being one (if not the) leading source](http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html). The solution was to reduce the number to 1 post-Soviet nuclear country. Even the Russian stockpiles had an American eye on them until 2012, by mutual agreement.

*Such an agreement could have changed the course of 20th century history, preventing Hitler's pact with Stalin which gave him free rein to go to war with Germany's other neighbours.*

*The new documents, copies of which have been seen by The Sunday Telegraph, show the vast numbers of infantry, artillery and airborne forces which Stalin's generals said could be dispatched, if Polish objections to the Red Army crossing its territory could first be overcome.*

*But the British and French side - briefed by their governments to talk, but not authorised to commit to binding deals - did not respond to the Soviet offer, made on August 15, 1939. Instead, Stalin turned to Germany, signing the notorious non-aggression treaty with Hitler barely a week later.*

5228,"&gt; Which politicians? Let me tell you a secret: german politicians are totally clueless when it comes to military affairs. Which means they are not credible conversation partners in that respect so nobody here would take them serious

Don't tell me that there is literaly zero politicians in Germany that would profile in security/defense issues. They don't have to perfect experts understanding every single weapons system or whatever, they would really just have to introduce debate - what are German security interests, what are the benefits and costs of Germany being in NATO and the EU (from the security point of view) and how should Germany contribute to these alliances.

If the result of this debate is that the majority of the German public feels comfortable being a freerider in NATO and does not want to contribute anything to boosting the alliance capabilities in the Eastern flank, then at least there would be some clarity on that, instead of what we have now.

And if you genuinely think that German politicians would have no arguments that could win over the population and that explaining to the German population that Bundeswehr is needed also because Germany needs to contribute to the alliance, then what is even the point to have you as an ally? I mean, if you think that this is close to snapping now, then surely you'd say that if Germany actually was forced to militarily help its allies in the East, it would snap anyway, right? If the public forced the political leadership to not help, then what's even the benefit of being in the alliance with you? 

I mean, if your public is perfectly okay with refusing to help allies, then perhaps it should also be confronted with no longer being able to extract benefits from the membership of NATO.

That being said, I don't really believe that this is the truth. I don't believe that it's impossible to convince most of the German public that contributing to the collective security of the alliance is necessary and benefitial for Germany itself.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/aavbxu/german_army_considers_recruiting_other_eu_citizens/ecw7kj8/,kristynaZ,1546201191

During the early days of the Empire, the Emperor could call upon levies from his various subjects, and travel around the Empire to put down unruly vassals. However following a series of interregnums and succession crises, the Emperors became much weaker and lost much of their control over the territories outside of their personal realm. The various princes also became far more powerful following the 14th Century, when they began to elect the Emperor.

Finally in 1648, after the 30 Yeas War, the various tiny states of the Holy Roman Empire were defined as sovereign entities. This formally turned it into what you describe, a loose confederation of various states.

I think the Holy Roman Empire under the Ottonians and Hohenstaufens could definetly be called an Empire, it wasn't that much less centralized than most other medieval european states at the time.",Kingdom of France,/r/europe/comments/aavxxt/the_history_of_europe_every_year/ecw8ua3/,Anthemius_Augustus,1546202178

5350,"&gt; A general measure should be to have more country-wide debate about security issues and how the army can help tackle them. Politicians simply need to explain more why is military needed and how it contributes to the safety of the German public. If people feel that the military is useful to them, they will appreciate it more and look at soldiers more favourably. 

For that to work, you'd have to change the entire threat perception. Current deployments are perceived as political favors to allies and not something that contributes to the safety of Germany.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; A more concrete measure to gain IT experts for example would be to connect the university IT faculties, the army and the defense industry sector more closely, similarely to how other industries are connected with the relevant vocational schools in Germany. 

Will be met with furious resistence from professors and students. Many universities employ civil clauses that bar military research. That went as far as to actually being written into law by the state of Lower Saxony for some years. The federal goverment can't do much about that since matters of education lie with the states.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; EDIT: I would also like to add that the results of the public debate on the security of Germany would be quite useful to your allies too. Germany is a country that is quite difficult to read when it comes to defense, it's not clear what your political elites think that your security interests are, it's not clear what the public thinks your security interests are, it's not clear how you want to achieve them. Overall more clarity from Germany in this area would be welcome. 

Brings me back to your first point. The public rejects intervention and projection of power via the military. Ideally it should act as a territorial defense force. Allies want it to do more than that. As a result you have a political leadership that is stuck in between.

The percentage increased between 1939 and 1943 due to the Rome-Berlin ''emigration pact'', however the percentage of italian spoker remained stable between 1947 and 1971, and decreased in the following years.

&gt;What about those who died because of its creation? 

What are you referring to here? In case you have forgotten it was created in and was formed during war time. Those who died as a result of the civil war can be used on both sides. My comment specifically referred to the estimated around 8 million excess deaths. Something which I have [evidence](http://www.academia.edu/1072631/Review_Red_Plenty_by_Francis_Spufford) and [other evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC259165/) to prove it with.

&gt;What about those who were send to Siberian work camps, just because they had one cow more than their neighbor? 

I doubt it. Evidence?

&gt;What about those who got shot by the KGB, for no reason? 

Most people executed probably were executed for one reason or another, but once again miscarriages of justice are hardly something specific to the USSR. They happen in the USA to this day and they happen in the Russian federation - the direct result of the event you think we should be celebrating so much.

&gt;What about those who got drafted into an army and died in Afghanistan? 

What about them? The fall of the USSR hasn‚Äôt failed to stop wars happening. People died in the war in Afghanistan fighting people like [this](https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/52a1c37869bedd476f5aaefd-750-501.jpg). They were fighting against terrorists that were supported by the USA. Do you use WW2 as an argument on the same lines? Do you forget that the socialist secular Afghanistan government invited the Soviets to fight these terrorists?

&gt;What about those whose food was taken away and sold to support industrialization, but in turn caused massive starvation? 

There was famine before the USSR and I think you‚Äôll find that the cycles of famine that had existed for centuries were ended by the communist party and the reforms they introduced. The main reason for the famine in the 1930s was actually the hoarding and burning of grain and livestock. [Even the BBC accepts this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/mwh/russia/stalincollectivisationrev1.shtml).

&gt;What about those who died to radiation because of mismanagement and what about those who are still dying or getting sick because of Chernobyl effects that are still felt today? 

How can you blame that on the fact that the USSR existed? There was a nuclear disaster in Fukushima this decade. You‚Äôre really clutching at straws now.

&gt;What about those who died because a tank ran them over, just because they wanted to express their free will?

[Uh-huh](https://imgur.com/ZTbgLw9), I really doubt that happened, but if it did provide evidence. And what do you mean by ‚Äúfree will‚Äù?

Okay, but that's precisely what you should have a debate about and maybe some of the politicians should be bold enough to try to explain to the public that Germany is in an alliance, it consumes the collective security that comes from it and so it is also expected that it will contribute to the collective security.

Because in the end, Germany also profits from the fact that EU and NATO states are not a target of hostile military aggression of foreign powers. Should that not be the case and should these alliances not work, conflicts that are nowadays contained in Ukraine might spill over to other countries, even to countries which are neighbouring Germany, or in an extreme scenario, even to Germany itself.

If the public does not understand this and does not understand for example why it's valuable that Germany sends its troops to the Baltics, then Germany will continue to be an unreliable ally.

A more concrete measure to gain IT experts for example would be to connect the university IT faculties, the army and the defense industry sector more closely, similarely to how other industries are connected with the relevant vocational schools in Germany.

EDIT: I would also like to add that the results of the public debate on the security of Germany would be quite useful to your allies too.

European market standards, for example, are very influential. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_effect)

Then we can also take initiative in building the international treaty structure needed to tackle the tragedy of the commons type dynamic that prevents a solution to the problem. This also requires cooperation of others, but when they just have to go along countries are much more likely to do so rather than actively oppose it, just like they would rather do nothing than actively go out of their way to improve their climate impact.

&gt; I'm all for that for the sake of doing our part

Absolutely, that's the basic standard. That alone already gives other countries the message that it's possible and feasible, and gives activists and politicians examples of successfull implementations.

In addition, if we're at the forefront of environmental regulation, we'll also cultivate the commercial products adapted to that new situation. It's not just charity, as some people fear.

Their competitors, the liberal [Open Vld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Vlaamse_Liberalen_en_Democraten) of the incumbent mayor and Samen (a common list of Christian democrats, social democrats and greens) refused to co-operate with Forza Ninove. N-VA, which lost heavily and was reduced to two seats, refused to work with both and chose for the opposition, leaving a padlock situation. Right before the deadline passed, one of the N-VA councillors decided to join a coalition of Open Vld and Samen, giving them a majority. The man was kicked out of the N-VA and received death threats from Forza supporters, but sticks to his decision, stating he wanted to put the interests of his town above those of his own carreer.

Also: South Tyrol had no native industry, pretty much all of it was built by the Italian goverment - stupidly, I'd have to add, since the region is pretty far off the industrial region around Milano and you had to bring in pretty much all raw materials from the south, and yeah, it did not end up becoming sustainable and is now all gone. Are you telling me that was not a deliberate attempt to establish an Italian majority in the region? Please.

Where is this italian majority danger if after 20 years the percentage of italian population was the same of 1943 ?

You surely know that the ''cattedrali nel deserto'' phenomenon, namely the building of industrial complexes in the middle of non industrial areas was a constant of post war Italy due to ideological motivations and mismanagement.

Indeed ST was not an industrial area, so you avoided the flooding of southerns that ''invaded'' the rest of north Italy with the exception of poor Veneto.

&gt;with SISDE running a good portion of the bombing campaign as false flag while torturing and murdering suspects and Italian carabinieri nearly executing the population of a whole village with more than 100 people in retaliation for a car accident they thought was an attack: Go fuck yourself.

''Nearly'' killed 100 people ???

Still no shooting of civilians, but a good number of policemen killed.

Violence of police, colour me surprised, same happen in all of Italy during lead years, there was not any widespread violence towards german population.

Before  you tell me to fuck myself you can ask the germans spaeakers in Hungary and romanian-german  (I choose former axis countries, so no ethnic revenge here) deported in Siberia if there is not true that the italian republican management toward germanic minority was pretty fair.

&gt;btw, fun fact: you ever talk to people from Trentino? They fucking hate the Italians in South Tyrol, terroni, all of them.

So?

First BFM and Figaro are in the verge to become FoxNews, you need to draw the line between editorial bias and spreading a political agenda. I do not endorse RT obviously, I'm just saying all of the information broadcasted to the masses (on TV) have a neoliberal bias, the same idelogy directly or indirectly attacked by the Yellow Vests. They heavily focus on the violence of protestors, ignoring the fact that the governement didn't listen to them until some violence were done and apologizing the violence of policemen (""Blue live matters"" style). 

Just recently, BFMTV invited as a neutral person on set a representative of parisian shopkeepers to speak about the Yellow Vests and the damages caused. BFMTV hid the fact that this guy was a candidate for the Parliament elections under Macron political party (he lost). It's not just editorial bias at this point, it's at best a blatent incompetence (just google his name before inviting him) and at worse (and certainly) a way to manipulate the public opinion.  BFM are more legitimate than RT because one is broadcasted on TV and the other on Internet but their integrity is similar. 

The yellow vests turns, logically, at ""alternative information sources"" which is where RT come in. Raw footages always seems preferable to be informed for people who distrust the mainstream medias. They have the feeling they can forge their own opinion without a man in suits hinting at them what to think. If you want to gain their trusts maybe start doing real journalist job because for now on, raw footages are a better reporting work than vox pop interviews (the speciality of 24/7 new channel) by example. 

Finally : 

&gt;France has a very wide spectrum of media of all sizes across the entire political spectrum

That's true but it doesn't tell the whole story. The TV (the most favored media by the lower classes) has a very narrow political spectrum (from center-right to right).

RT does not employ journalists and it does not report the news or engage in journalism. It is not a news outlet but a military operation. 

What you write may be your impression of the French media landscape, but it is objectively wrong. France has a very wide spectrum of media of all sizes across the entire political spectrum: http://www.digitalnewsreport.org/

As a side note, the difference in editorial line between BFM and other French TV stations is very obvious to me even as a foreigner. 

You're also making the very common mistake of equating editorial line with journalistic quality. I may not agree with the political positions and conclusions of Le Figaro or Die Welt, but I know their reporting is fact-based and they are not deliberately lying or trying to mislead their readers. I also know that RT is in fact systematically lying and trying to mislead its readers and viewers because of all the times they've been caught doing so.

Actual journalists make mistakes and have biases, like anyone in any profession, but they are under far more scrutiny than any other profession for them with possibly the exception of the health care sector. Journalism is not designed to make these mistakes (while RT *is* designed to misinform you), just like chemotherapy is not designed to make you throw up. 

Journalists have norms and rules, usually *self-imposed ones* in how to deal with these mistakes, entire sub-sections of the sector and parts of every reputable newsroom devoted to finding them. Der Spiegel is handling the Claas Relotius affair - devoting its entire front page to it! - for the most recent example. Can you imagine RT admitting any mistake like that?

Also the lyrics I choose were the only of that song to support your photo OP. The other verses name Irish men who fought and died on the other side.

Do not dare dismiss these men's lives by saying that Irish didn't fight against fascism 

&gt;They came to stand beside the Spanish people
To try and stem the rising fascist tide
Franco‚Äôs allies were the powerful and wealthy
Frank Ryan‚Äôs men came from the other side

&gt;Even the olives were bleeding
As the battle for Madrid it thundered on
Truth and love against the force of evil
Brotherhood against the fascist clan

&gt;Bob Hilliard was a Church of Ireland pastor
Form Killarney across the Pyrenees he came
From Derry came a brave young Christian Brother
Side by side they fought and died in Spain

&gt;Tommy Woods age seventeen died in Cordoba
With Na Fianna he learned to hold his gun
From Dublin to the Villa del Rio
Where he fought and died beneath the blazing sun

If your pushing an agenda then grand. But give the full story. Showing a photo and staying ""this was Ireland"" is wrong. Do some research and show what percentage was in fact supportive of Franco.

In Spain we care about family, we are not a soulless culture who hates having small talk with other people. We are not passive aggressive weirdos who need to buy prime time on reddit and make it look like if the world ""loved us"".

True is Spaniards spend more time with their families but that's in part to the economic crisis and cultural mentality. If you want to use that as a way to do harm I must say go back to your dark and isolated sauna. Or better get drunk as usual right?.

I must say despite the terrible labor market in Spain(which it would make you happy, because you exploit it). Spain is way healthier country that most scandinavian. Just read your comments to realize you have nothing else in your life to do other than policing this sub ;-).

It must be tough for you living in such isolated country where people cannot even make eye contact with other humans let alone having random chat unless is strictly necessary.

5692,"&gt;I think it's a pity that the English took all the terrible spelling from the French and none of the awesome monarch-head-chopping.

The awesome monarch head chopping that lead to the restoration of the monarchy a few decades later? Aswell as two Empires?

The reason France is a Republic today frankly has more to do with the fact that the Bourbon pretender (Henri V) to the French throne in 1871 was pretty unreasonable in his demands (refusing to become King unless France abandoned the tricolor as the national flag), and as such the French government decided to wait for a more liberal pretender.
But by the time the last Bourbon pretender finally died, royalists no longer had a majority in the national assembly, and people had moved on by that point.

That the Republic became France's lasting government form was really a result of a series of seemingly random circumstances, most politicians after Napoleon (the first one) were in favour of some kind of monarchy. In other words, most politicians in France during the early 19th Century tended to look towards 1791 as the ideal, rather than 1793.",Kingdom of France,/r/europe/comments/aanj26/how_inbred_are_europes_monarchs_oc/ecv9upp/,Anthemius_Augustus,1546173030

5765,"&gt; Yeah, I'm not big into this whole cultural appropriation bit.

Me neither, that's why Americans need to stop pretending to be Cherokee, Irish or Norwegian as an ""ethnic option"", a ""symbolic ethnicity"", as if it were a leisure activity.

Imagine the arrogance of Americans trying to unilaterally redefine semantics to the point where ""I am --"" now literally means ""I am of --ian descent"", just because they are plagued with an identity crisis and their young nation barely has any history. 

That Americans are rootless is their problem. especially when it's so opportunistic that their ""ethnicity"" (one of, say 32 or 64 they get to choose from like a menu) vanishes like a fart in the wind as soon as trouble arrives and they want to be American again to wank over their military might.

And 'Black Friday' isn't 'culture' you American bellend. It's a surrogate for culture, a phenomenon perfectly describing the utter hollow superficiality that Americans bring to the table besides pop culture and mindless mass entertainment. 

And no, we hardly do 'Black Friday' if at all. No fat people crushing door styles to kill each other for the sake of buying shit. 

But for you to present an example of your culture, out of all the things you could have chosen, which is a dark spectacle of violent consumerism we didn't even adopt as a continent is the funniest stereotype I've seen in a while.

Italians, Greeks, Norwegians, the Polish and the Irish ultimately decide who is one of theirs, and if we won't humour the role-playing embarrassment that
is 5th generation melting pot Americans selecting whichever great-grandmother they fancy for the time being, that is *our* prerogative.

If we really want to do something against climate change, we need to change a lot and also renounce a lot of convenient things. If the government forced us to renounce e.g. cars this would cost a lot of our freedom, so there needs to be another solution but I have no idea what.

5856,"Paywall. For those who do not have access:

Russian President Vladimir Putin has a new toy and he wants Russians to think of it as their Christmas present, too. On Wednesday, he¬†called¬†the successful test of a new supersonic weapon ‚Äúa remarkable, excellent New Year‚Äôs gift to the nation.‚Äù Russians probably would have preferred a rollback of a recent retirement-age increase under their trees, but that doesn‚Äôt much matter to Putin‚Äôs view of his country‚Äôs national interest.

The question to ask as a¬†bad¬†political year ends for Putin is to what degree his militaristic worldview should survive his leadership. That doesn‚Äôt only depend on Russians;¬†once Putin is gone, the West ‚Äî¬†but largely Europe ‚Äî¬†will have another chance to tempt Russia with different prospects.

Russia has a broad set of geopolitical options. It can try to be a global military superpower, a status it achieved in the 20th century despite a weak economy thanks to its armaments and creative strength harnessed by fearsomely repressive regimes. It can accept the status of a regional power, increasingly turning into China‚Äôs junior ally and natural-resource base. Finally, it could establish¬†itself as part of a greater Europe, following¬†ideas¬†first developed in the early 20th century by Halford Mackinder, one of the fathers of geopolitics.

Putin‚Äôs predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, at first embraced the latter path, but his impoverished, chaotic Russia scared and repelled Europeans, who saw an alliance with the U.S. as far more profitable and useful from a security point of view. The U.S. never supported the greater-Europe notion because, ever since French President Charles de Gaulle advocated ‚Äúa Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals‚Äù in 1959, this was a project to counterbalance U.S. power. Meanwhile, not even Yeltsin could quite imagine Russia fully integrated into European institutions, which were still taking shape during his rule. His last years in power were spent in a clumsy balancing act between Russia‚Äôs three¬†options.

Putin inherited this fundamentally weak stance. A quick learner and adroit tactician, he soon had the skill (and the oil revenue windfall)¬†to play Russia‚Äôs cards better than Yeltsin had done. Yet his natural preference was for the superpower option, the iffiest and most adventurous of the three but also the most consistent with his training and experience as a Cold War spy.¬†Besides, he didn‚Äôt see a viable alternative.¬†He‚Äôd come¬†to see Europe as a collection of U.S. vassals incapable of independent policy. So,¬†ever since his 2007 Munich¬†speech¬†criticizing the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the power dynamics of a ‚Äúunipolar world,‚Äù Putin has pursued the superpower revival plan through military adventures in Georgia, Ukraine, Syria and now, with the help of private mercenary armies, in Africa.

Strengthening economic ties with Europe and supplying resources for China‚Äôs continuing boom ‚Äî¬†the other two parts of the initial balancing act ‚Äî¬†became harder with this refocusing. Europe‚Äôs peace¬†project rejects aggression. To China, a militarily powerful, assertive Russia is an annoyance rather than a potential ally, and any kind of resource dependence on it is a risk.

The superpower¬†game can only be played if Russia has a¬†formidable nuclear deterrent. Without it, the Kremlin¬†doesn‚Äôt have the freedom to fight smaller wars. That‚Äôs why Putin focuses on developing weapons the U.S. and its allies don‚Äôt have. The Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, tested on Wednesday in Putin‚Äôs presence, supposedly can break through missile-defense systems to deliver a nuclear payload at 20 times the speed of sound.¬†

Vladislav Surkov, once Putin‚Äôs chief domestic ideologist and in recent years his eastern Ukraine czar, wrote an¬†article¬†in April extolling the virtues of geopolitical solitude. ‚ÄúFor four centuries, Russia moved east and for another four centuries it moved west,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúBoth paths are at their end.‚Äù

But even the ‚Äúhappy solitude of a leader, a breakaway¬†alpha-nation,‚Äù to use Surkov‚Äôs phrase, is increasingly hard to sell to Russians. For the older generation, Putin‚Äôs is the second iteration of a superpower game that brought¬†them no economic benefits. For younger Russians, it‚Äôs an opportunity-limiting factor. Many Russians realize, now that they‚Äôve seen the world, that their country doesn‚Äôt have the economic power to go it alone. Repression is Putin‚Äôs only answer to these doubts and fears.

It‚Äôs not a comfortable answer, however, given Russia‚Äôs history of blowing up when its people‚Äôs patience runs out.¬†Whenever and however Putin may leave, any successor will need to revise Russia‚Äôs¬†geopolitical choice. Putin has taken two decades to show that he doesn‚Äôt have a reverse gear. A new leader will be free from this constraint, and Russia may find itself considering its three choices again.

Europe has a lot to gain if it has the courage. Drawing Russia in could solve some of the European Union‚Äôs fundamental problems. With its massive natural-gas reserves, Russia could propel Europe faster toward hard-to-reach environmental goals. With its untapped economic potential and need for immigrants to develop its vast territory, it could be a big help in resolving migration issues. With its recent investment in agile, modern military power ‚Äî¬†yes, in the Avangard, too ‚Äî¬†it could provide a backbone for a joint European military.¬†

Establishing a vast European common market including Russia wouldn‚Äôt be impossible: Even despite Putin‚Äôs hostility toward the West, Russia has¬†adopted¬†many European technical standards as it moved away from obsolete Soviet ones.¬†

All of this, of course, would only make sense for Europe if Russia were prepared to yield some sovereignty, accept some rules of conduct and adopt Europe‚Äôs¬† values. That‚Äôs difficult to imagine today, but then the current EU would have looked fantastical¬†as recently as 30 years ago. If European leaders were more farsighted, they‚Äôd be working on a¬†comprehensive trade and security offer to Putin‚Äôs successor.

In the absence of such interest from Europe, any Putin successor will be tempted to continue the superpower game to the bitter economic end, with China waiting to get access to Russia‚Äôs natural resources on the most favorable terms it can get. The option of continuing as China‚Äôs junior partner, the least preferable for Russia, could end up choosing itself.

That‚Äôs hardly in Russia‚Äôs interest ‚Äî¬†and probably not in Europe‚Äôs, either, because would mean either a repeat of post-Soviet chaos or a strengthening of China. I‚Äôm unaware, however, of any preparatory work in the European capitals for the inevitable Russian succession.

With Russia left to its own devices,¬†Putin‚Äôs geopolitical choice, with supersonic weapons under the Christmas tree, has a good chance of surviving his departure from the Kremlin.

&gt;The H1-B visa isn't for Silicon Valley, it's for the country, but the US is a country that doesn't make education affordable. We aren't really interested in making medical school easier to access, we're just willing to import a doctor who got training elsewhere (at the cost of their country's citizens) instead. Medical school is stupidly expensive.

You're painting an incorrect picture here. The US has higher college [graduation rates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tertiary_education_attainment) than the vast majority of the world and most of Europe.


It is extremely expensive to study in the US, but despite this tertiary education is still more prevalent than in most other places. So this idea that there is a lack of college graduates in the US because of cost is not true. People simply borrow to go to college anyway.
