You cannot produce good solutions without first understanding the problem you wish to solve, how it fits in a wider context and whether it actually even needs addressing.

That's not true. 

NI can secede because the GFA mandates that if there's indication that the NI public supports reunification then a border poll *must* be held on the question. 

There is a legally defined process there. For Scotland, there is no such mandated process. There is no legal mechanism to leave the UK, much in the same way there's no legal mechanism for any region of Spain to just decide to secede. 

Scotland was *allowed* a referendum. Under the devolution laws, constitutional matters are explicitly reserved for Westminster to decide on. After negotiations by the SNP with the coalition government an exception was permitted which allowed the Scottish Parliament to pass the Scottish Independence Referendum Act and hold the referendum. 

In order to have another referendum the Scottish Government would have to negotiate a second exception otherwise any referendum held would be considered illegal and unconstitutional.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/b6y4ej/brexit_mps_defeat_mays_withdrawal_agreement_for/ejpfql8/,Mynameisaw,1553911060

Training doesn't seem realistic (more going through the motions..) and even things like fitness and basic soldiering skills seem off. I have a cousin who decided to go the officer route in the Bundeswehr and while the academic aspect seems excellent (seriously, his military history is spot on and he can think strategically) the leadership ability is just not there in the same way, small unit tactics seem under practised, fieldcraft seems almost theoretical.

It's both funny and sad, how few people here have actually read [the directive](http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-6637-2019-INIT/EN/pdf).

Page 67:
&gt; The cooperation between online content service providers and rightholders **shall not result in the prevention of the availability of works** or other subject matter uploaded by users **which do not infringe copyright** and related rights, **including where such works or subject matter are
covered by an exception or limitation**.

Page 68:
&gt; When rightholders request to remove or disable access to their specific works or other subject matter, they shall duly justify the reasons for their requests. Complaints submitted under this mechanism shall be processed without undue delay and **decisions to remove or disable access to uploaded content shall be subject to human review**.

&gt; **This Directive shall in no way affect legitimate uses, such as uses under exceptions and 
limitations provided for in Union law**, and shall not lead to any identification of individual 
users nor to the processing of their personal data, in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC, 
Directive 2002/58/EC and the General Data Protection Regulation.

255,"Pointing out near identical behaviors in European and non-European ethnicites on a Europe-centered forum isn't an attempt at muddying the waters. You can't seriously assume anyone on /r/europe thinks with Mauritanian laws on their minds... This is yet another dog whistle issue for the *concerned citizen brigade* that happens to be pretty anti-LGBT when the winds don't happen to blow against that particular matter. 

&gt;But the fact of the matter is in every single country in Europe LGBT rights are upheld in the legal system whereas in 33 countries in Africa and the entirety of the Middle East it is illegal to be attracted to the same sex.

And neither the OP story, nor the comment I originally replied to remarked that. And let's not even get into how differently those LGBT rights are interepreted in Sweden vs. Russia. 

&gt;So the next time an Imam is preaching about how gays should be murdered or when Islamic fundamentalist groups in Chechnya are sending death squads around to murder gay people and their family members who don't turn them in you can explain how it's ""islamophobic"" and we should be moderate centrists and welcome differing views and come to a compromise where only half of gays are killed.

257,"&gt;Its not like Facebook or YouTube is competing with any legacy business.

Youtube facilitates 60% of digital music streaming but only pays 11% of the revenue that artists get paid for digital music streaming.

It is almost impossible for streaming companies that actually have to pay for licenses to compete when Youtube can serve the majority of the market while only paying a fraction of the royalties and having a much wider library under the guise that its ""user uploaded content"" and so they're not liable for .

Much smaller companies have been sued into non-existence for trying to take advantage of the same loophole, Grooveshark to name but one, they simply don't have the political clout and economic might that Google has to get away with it. Ironically both Google and Facebook started to censor Grooveshark before they finally got sued out of existence, both companies leading the charge against them being forced to play by the same rules.

This is not a ""deregulating"" dynamic that leads to a future with freedom for all, its a dynamic that leads to a future where only huge monopolies can compete because they've rigged the system so no one else can compete with them, while cynically proclaiming a love of freedom and deregulation only when it benefits themselves and never when it doesn't.

You can say they're just taking advantage of new technology that old laws weren't designed around, and avoiding inefficient and burdensome regulation, except they're actively gaming the system for their own benefit at all times.

Google sits on a mountain of software patents and copyrights and they have no intention of letting them go, and they use the government to prosecute them heavily to prevent competition and innovation. Google stacked the Obama-era Whitehouse and FTC with former Google staffers. they are masters at regulatory capture.

""regulation for thee but not for me"" is not freedom of any kind, its just a power grab for monopolists.

&gt; Rather, I’d see the same level of under-legislation (as far as that is the case) distributed to older legacy businesses, and the exceptions made standard

That's never going to happen when these companies are actively and at all times working on securing corporate privileges for themselves and no one else.

If a hospital has to pay for a licensing fee to play music I fail to see why one of the biggest companies in the world should be exempt.

&gt;I remember seeing a Peter Thiel video (on YouTube even) going on about how perhaps the breakneck speed of internet technology can be attributed to the lower level of legislation in that field, as compared to most other areas which have progressed at a much slower speed. 

Peter Thiel wrote a book, Zero To One, where he explicitly outlined his intention to monopolize every business he was in so he could crush competition and then price gouge consumers.

""competition is for losers"" and ""monopolies are the way to go"" sound like hyperbolic paraphrasing but they're actual quotes. Thiel doesn't give a solitary droplet of shit about allowing consumer choice.

This is a ""libertarian"" who makes millions mining big data for big government.

Although we should be grateful for Thiel being sociopathic to admit this because its the dominant philosophy in Silicon Valley, Thiel just doesn't feel a need to hide beyond ""making the world a better place"".

432,"I was in the German Navy and I can tell you, we are so fasucking inefeccient. One thing to note is on how fast something is declared as in not working condition. You heard about all of these stuff that doesn't work right? I can tell you, easily 90% works just fine, but the military places way too high of a standard on everything where a motor that hasn't been inspected in the last 8 hours may already be considered as ""not in working condition"". 

The next part is on how much time is often spend in quite a useless way. For example, cleaning times are often placed in such a shitty way together with all the other stuff, that you just can't get stuff done as a soldier. Example: I've had to do oil inspections for the motor, we just had a training instance, brought everything back and now have like 45 minutes until cleaning starts. My oil inspection takes around 1 hour and it is stupid if I were to do it any shorter than that because half the time is spend solely on getting the equipment and cleaning it.

This means I can either waste a bunch of time trying to do my oil inspection or not. THere is no exception of me maybe starting a bit later or similar.

Even with almost full crew on the ship it was nearly impossible to stay on top of having everything maintained according to standard, which is why you either don't have everything maintained and declared unusable or you cut corners, which was done a lot. You won't believe how many people I've seen write down values just from their memory without even actually looking for said values. 

Not there is a lot of other stuff as well. Germany has a fuckload of mostly useless office staff in the military. I would bet that easily 1/3-1/2 of the soldiers never actually do any real battle training and are just doing office stuff all day long. I don't know British or French wages for the military, but Germany does have quite high wages for everyone, this may also play a part in the entire thing.

Then there is the most pressing thing probably. There is just such a huge amount of waste in producing stuff. For example, the new 125 class was supposed to be fully rolled out for 4 years now. They should already have replaced the 122 class. Meanwhile the 122 is the probably most used class in the entire navy while the 125 has still to actually get out of production for the first ship. This problem persists not only with the 125, eerything takes too long. If you are quoted for a ship maintainance that it will take 6 months, you can be sure that it will take 11 months.  If you are quoted for a year, we can see you back in 1.5-2 years.  There are people who are two years in service on a ship with only a few days actually being at sea. The rest of the time they added zero value to nothing.  Just imagine your contractor in a private area would take nearly double the time for the repair than they quoted you, but will bill you for the entire time. 

We have people decide for equipment and budged matters who apparently never saw the actually reality of the situation and this is a problem. Why would we need 2 crews for a single ship? We would be better off having 3 ships for 2 crews by how long they are in a state of repair. ",,/r/europe/comments/b6ydmf/defense_expenditures_of_nato_countries/ejomrwr/,Mad_Maddin,1553889212

529,"I am afraid if that is what they though in schools in the good brand new USA, that’s just wrong.

You are right in that most of Iberoamérica the people are way more mixed than in NA. It wasn’t rape (although it obviously wasn’t uncommon) but the fact that in early 15th century Spain was the first country to make laws that declared the natives citizens of Spain (the encomienda system in the “Laws of the Indira”), and although it wasn’t fully applied at first because the colonist didn’t wanted to follow the law from the king (the system had viceroyalties and under then the comuneros) in 1542 the “new laws” passed, in some countries (like what now is Perú), the colonists reveles against the crown because they considered it was unfair for them, in fact in Mexico the colonists at first didn’t apply it, but eventually had to and they ended up losing their wealth. The “new laws” further limited the excesses of the encomienda system (that already prohibited enslaving the natives since 1512 although as I said the colonists never wanted to apply it). Then in 1550-1551 the Valladolid debate took place, and the dawn of human rights concept was born. More importantly, the debate reflected a concern for morality and justice in 16th-century Spain that only surfaced in other colonial powers centuries later. It’s curious how other countries maintained slaves in their countries centuries later but Spain, trough the black legend (I am sure you know about it), is the one that is portrayed as evil, even though  the criticism to Spain is about events taken place 3 centuries before and far far less grow-some and terrible as they have been portrayed in English speaking countries. 

To suggest that the encomenderos (the colonists) just followed the orders of the Spanish monarchy is just plain false. The colonists never wanted to comply with the law issued by the Spanish monarchy because those laws always diminished the colonist powers and highlighted the fact that natives were also citizens of the crown of Spain.

Also cheap labor is an effect, not a cause. You are kind of looking at it the other way. It's not because romanians are cheaper, it's because english people are too expensive. This is actually a sign of a healthy, competitve economy. Yes, it leaves some people out, but it's the people that demand more than their work value.

594,"It really depends. You have to understand that what AKP is is actually a network of interest. If you are a party member you have very good opportunities in your life. Here are your options if you support AKP:

1) You can directly work for the state. You can be a police or a civil servant. There are around 270 thousand police in Turkey, and this is only the police. There are many other similar jobs in Turkey and they all get good money. The lowest police salary is 4.5k per month and that is really low for the police, while a medical doctor might get around 7k. So you see the problem? It does pay off to be an Erdogan supporter.

2) You can work in a municipality. Most major cities and nearly all small cities are ruled by AKP and they give you good money if you work there. You are mostly expected to show up in Erdogan meetings and be an active supporter. 

3) You can work in private companies working with the state, which means nearly all private companies. Largest projects in Turkey are infrastructure projects like the new airport, roads and bridges etc, or energy infrastructure or state supported production stuff. So even if you want to work in a private company, you better support Erdogan or act like you do.

There are many uneducated supporters of Erdogan and nationalists in general but those people do not make decisions. Actually I would confidently say that more than half the country hates Erdogan, if not more. But what can you do really? I have college degree and I make around 2-3k liras per month. If I lose my job I cant live another month. It is a real desparate situation that you get used to live in.

The British people took the first opportunity given to leave the EU, so clearly Brits do not want to be part of any federal EU, regardless of whether it's legitimate or artificial.

EU doesn’t just give money to countries. There are specific guidelines which it follows when allocating grants budget for projects in certain areas.

I used to work for an NGO and we won an EU grant a couple of times (culture project), upwards of €200k and the amount of work and standards EU applies in overseeing the project was the most stringent I’ve ever come across. So it’s no joke, you really need to have some pros working on the project and a tight plan in order to win an EU grant. 
If the EU thinks a project doesn’t stand a good chance to become self-sustainable once the grant money is spent it won’t fund it. I’m curious to see what the success rate of EU funded projects is but wouldn’t be surprised if it were high.

&gt; I expect us leaving to be shit in the short term

*And* the long term. I'm sorry but this isn't a ""struggle today, prosper tomorrow"" situation. Economic analyses are in consensus that we're irreparably harming our long-term potential.

And that means *you* get poorer, and our NHS and police are slower to get the funding they need, and more people die needlessly, and we turn to cheaper sources of shitty food in the world market because we have to.


&gt; I also think that the EU has a hand to play in the rising inequality

I'd call that more the fault of domestic government which slices public services via austerity, sets relatively low taxes for the rich, and fails to regulate the housing market effectively.

The EU has much less control over our economy than you think. And don't forget that we have always had a democratic say in the EU's processes. 

Now we lose that input, but do you suppose the effects of our neighbouring continent will not still be felt in the UK? That we can bury our heads in the sand and expect not to be impacted by EU policies, having thrown away our power to influence them?

---

&gt; freedoms

As far as freedoms go, we aren't exactly a libertarian paradise on the home front. The bulk of losses to personal freedom in the UK have come from domestic lawmaking, as we have pretty authoritarian domestic government.

And we do lose freedoms by leaving the EU. For example, the right to freely travel and work across all of Europe, which is a pretty amazing privilege for a person to have. It belies an astounding lack of ambition that people would disregard such a right, let alone to strip it from their fellow citizens who *do* want to keep it.

&gt; I also think a country should be able to control who it lets into its borders.

Sure. But we *do* control who we let into our borders!

Do you know that the UK will still be in need of cheap immigration after brexit? Our businesses heavily rely on labour which British workers cannot provide. And *you* benefit from that, by low prices. 

So with immigration continuing to be inevitable, would you rather immigrants come from Europe, or from other, less-culturally-aligned parts of the world like Pakistan, West Africa, or the Middle East?

&gt; protectionist free trade

Sure, it's a protectionist organisation - but considering the EU makes up a full 20% of the world's GDP, it's not exactly a small zone of protectionism. Moreover, as EU members we are party to excellent trade deals with other countries in the world - which we are now losing from Brexit (only 8 out of 40 have been partially replicated).

Because you agreed to give it to them in the first place (talking about the parents here, not the children). So they are the Danish responsibility.

877,"&gt;Er zitten in Nederland al genoeg mensen zonder baan, 

Dit los je niet op door immigratie te stoppen, we hebben al een personeel tekort aan mensen in veel industrieen bijvoorbeeld zorg.

Het idee dat immigratie compleet stoppen meer problemen oplost dan dat het zal creeëren klopt gewoon niet.



&gt;er is ook simpelweg niet genoeg ruimte voor immigratie zeker wanneer ze kinderen nemen; 

We zouden technisch gezien als we net zo dichtbevolkt zouden wonen als het meest dichtbevolkte land in de wereld 500 miljoen inwoners kunnen hebben, dit is niet iets wat ik zou willen maar we zullen pas in 2050 19 miljoen bereiken, aan ruimte hebben in Nederland geen probleem.



&gt;De immigranten integreren ook heel slecht.

Er zijn zeker immigranten die zich niet goed integreren, maar bijna alle immigranten die ik heb leren kennen zijn allemaal prima geintegreerd, ik zie gewoon dit probleem niet in onze samenleving.

&gt;Over het klimaatakoord, natuurlijk snap ik dat we niet oneindig fossiele brandstoffen hebben en we moeten alternatinief even verzinnen. Maar het huidige plan kost te veel geld voor te weinig resultaat. En de derde wereldlanden die gaan ook echt niet overstappen totdat alle fossiele brandstoffen op zijn. Dan kan je natuurlijk zeggen dat wij een voorbeeld moeten zijn, maar daar gaan arme landen niet om geven. Wat wel zou helpen is de economie in die landen helpen groeien met de voorwaarde dat ze ook groener gaan worden (wat dan met heel de EU afgesproken moet worden). En dat zou natuurlijk veel geld gaan kosten en het zou ook erg moeilijk zijn om dat te gaan doen, ook omdat China al enorm investeert in Afrika, maar dat is de enige manier waarmee ze gaan overstappen. En dan zijn  Rusland, de VS, China, en India er ook nog, die moeten dan zelf meedoen, wat erg onwaarschijnlijk is in de nabije toekomst. Dus wat er nu gaat komen daar heb ik geen vertrouwen in.

Het huidige plan kost minder dan verwacht 1,6-1,9 miljard per jaar, fors lager dan de verwachte 3-3,9 miljard per jaar.

Wij zijn verantwoordelijk voor onze uitstoot en niemand anders, de kosten die we nu investeren krijgen we gedurende de komende eeuw(en) meerdere keren terug in bespaarde kosten door de gevolgen van klimaat verandering te verminderen.

De kosten van het klimaatakkoord moeten niet bij de gemmidelde burger worden neergelegd, de vervuilers moeten hun eigen verduurzaming betalen in de vorm van een co2 heffing.

893,"&gt; Narrowly passing a law you don't entirely agree with is far from becoming tyrannical.

Whether it's tyrannical depends on the repression the law imposes, and the repression this law imposes is monumental. 

For you to claim otherwise is a bit like a carpenter telling a pulmonologist that ephysema is merely a rhetorical exaggeration. 

&gt; If you don't like corporate lobbying, you must like the EU: the EU has done things like fining Microsoft, preventing mergers etc.

Yes, because Microsoft is American. Turkey might also be targeted, as might Russia, but when it comes to European lobby groups, it infrequently escalates beyond a slap on the wrist. The corrupt French and German lobbies responsible for this mess are pampered and placated. That's not only not good enough: it's regional chauvinism and double standards.

There's plenty of googling you can do on corporate lobbying in the E.U. and to pretend the E.U. is an undivided, unmitigated success in the struggle against corporatist corruption when E.U. law literally mandates neoliberal free market ideology and facilitates corrupt European lobbies resulting in monstrosities such as this is dishonest.

&gt; So you want to be slaves to the demands of corporations who can just move from one jurisdiction to another if they don't get the laws they want?

This goes both ways: if I run a small or medium-sized business, I no longer have to be a slave to the demands of authoritarian nations or backsliding, illiberal democracies as I move from one jurisdiction to another.

Clearly, the alternative is acceding to Europe wide corporate neoliberal repression. I weigh the options and choose the destroy the E.U.

I'm fully content with that decision, because E.U. has violated my ultimate red line, and you clearly don't appreciate the seriousness of my previous statements on the matter, nor how deeply offended and appalled I am by the E.U. intrusion into my field and its savaging of digital liberties, which you aren't professionally equipped to understand the far-reaching implications of.

&gt; So you think that corporations should be able to perform environmentally harmful practices

The entire notion that pulse fishing was ""environmentally harmful"" was a product of French corporate PR lobbying, and you googled just now and immediately fell for it. The alternative, dragnet fishing, rips apart the sea floor and that is what fishermen are now going back to: because of the corrupt, crony, jealous French and their underhanded E.U. machinations.

&gt; a minor problem like the alleged miscategorizing of pulse fishing

Tell that to the Dutch fishermen whose entire lives and livelihoods are invested in this. Also, there is no ""alleged"". It's miscategorised, period, and this unscientific miscategorisation is the product of French lobbyist lying.

&gt; A much better way to address things like this is giving the EP legislative initiative, so they can amend the existing laws on their own initiative, rather than having to wait until the Commision starts it.

No, this entire directive should have never been made. It's a transparent attempt by lobbyist cronies and French cultural nationalist to control and repress the internet. Giving the E.U. legislative initiative when the majority of the EP was in favour of this miscarriage of a law will be of no use, and it does nothing to clear up the lobbyist corruption problem.

&gt; By blowing up the EU you will be exposed to much stronger corporate pressure.

By blowing up the E.U., corporations no longer have a single point of access they can corrupt. So, when The Netherlands wants pulse fishing they will do pulse fishing, and all the French can do is specifically refuse those ships entry from their waters. We can then collaborate with other countries who aren't as corrupt and decided on our own fishing policies.

Same with upload filters. So, no, I don't agree the corporate pressure would always be stronger, but at minimum, political diversity would thwart the corrupt neoliberal and Franco-German control to a much better degree than possible now. 

The constant claims that international coordination of policy would be impossible without the E.U. only supports my claim: it takes away a single point of access for the French, the Germans, or any other corporatist sack of shit seeking to legislate digital liberties ouf of existence for purposes of capitalist greed.


&gt; Again, it's the same politicians in the national states

Given the regional differences, this is outright false.

&gt; Then you would be inconsequential - why apply a different solution for the same problem?

For the same reason you yourself brought it up. You expect that I would respond in a different way when facing my own government - and I would. Simple enough, no need to tapdance around your own point with sophistry once I give you the clarity you are demanding in terms of differential approach.

&gt; Again, it's not the EU, it's elected representatives of the people and of the governments of the member states. Almost half of the EP voted against it. And thanks to the resistance we put up, there are many limitations introduced in the text

This is the ""fig leaf"" reasoning I'm so very used to over the past 25 years. Horrible legislation is introduced, and the text starts out being ***utterly insane***, then, using the DITF technique, negotiators concede ""compromises""  moving the needle the point on the scale they always anticipated it would end up at.

This process is entirely hollow and meaningless and the compromise is just as horrible as anything else: the fundamental obligation of upload filters is still there, no matter how apologists (fig leaf-based or otherwise) attempt to spin it. 

There is **clearly** a problem of structural neoliberal corporatist corruption inside the E.U., with double standards and severity of intervention applied depending on regional origin.

What we have to do now is destroy the E.U. what the E.U. can do to prevent this is fully repeal this totalitarian monstrosity of a law. This isn't a negotiation, and the saponaceous, siippery, fast-talking bureaucrats who think they can jedi mind trick the increasingly angry European populace with the usual corporatist boilerplate platitudes and psychological manipulation fig leaf tactics are sorely mistaken.

The E.U. has just turned a substantial portion of its already shrinking base into a direct enemy. **Should the E.U. respond to this unforgivable blunder by displaying the same stubborn, obtuse  wilfully ignorant, obstuctionist hostily they displayed regarding the economic and migrant crisis, it's going to end very, very badly**.

The elections are soon. I will vote to destroy the E.U. and every single goddamn brother in this beautiful field of hours who still has an ounce of fucking integrity will do the same. 

Fuck the E.U. and the E.C. - we know they won't budge, and now neither will we. Down with all of it - my allegiance lies with my beloved field, not with disgusting luddite cretins like Voss and his cronies.

I know the difference can at times be subtle, but ""*shamelessly coercing your friends and partners into following your views*"" and ""*constructively negotiating with your friends and partners to reach an agreeable compromise*"" are actually two different sorts of actions and not freely interchangeable.

For decades, the UK have abused its veto rights to blackmail and undermine the EEC/EU, in its own, exclusive interest. Literally no other member state behaved this way, continental Europeans actually cooperated together to reach their common goals. I'd expect living in one of the world's oldest democracies would make one familiar with this concept. Maybe I'm wrong.

Incidentally, stating that the UK didn't squeeze out enough exemptions from the EU, implying it didn't have enough already, is beyond wrong and deluded: it's, quite frankly, downright indecent and obscene.

It has been pointed out already that of all the members of the EU, the UK enjoyed the most exemptions and special treatments. Which was already, in my opinion, highly aberrant and exceptionally unfair for everybody else. You know, your equal partners.

All of our choices have shades of grey ie. both good and bad things are going to happen because of them. There are probably right now some policies of current progressive democratic governments that in the future will be considered evil. And this may be because either we do not have the full picture of what is happening or the people in the future do not have the full picture of what it is like to live in today's society.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/b6pm35/brexit_standing_ovation_no_uk_prime_minister_ever/ejna88c/,Salmonman4,1553853801

995,"&gt;If someone wants to make something entertaining, then do it for fun.  
  
Unfortunately creating [""The Far Side"" wasn't for fun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Larson#The_Far_Side) it was for money. It was a syndicated comic - so he could pay his bills.  
  
&gt;While on vacation in San Francisco, he pitched his work to the San Francisco Chronicle and, to his surprise, the Chronicle bought the strip and promoted it for syndication, renaming it The Far Side.[4] Its first appearance in the Chronicle was on January 1, 1980. A week later, The Seattle Times dropped Nature's Way.[5] The Far Side ran for fifteen years, syndicated initially by Chronicle Features and later by Universal Press Syndicate, until Larson retired with his final strip published on January 1, 1995.  
  
It was not a ""meme"" when it was published, and, except as allowed by law, should be protected as his copyrighted Intellectual property. 
  
&gt;Imagine if every guy that made a meme decided he wants compensation for creating the meme, and the law enforced it.  
  
As I said, Larson didn't make a meme, he was selling his syndicated comic.  
  
 You say ""most"" - which? Not to put too fine a point on it, but everyone who creates original products like this deserve to be protected. Do you feel like this about music, videos, and movies? Should all entertainment be free? All of those people(every single one), the singers, artists, programmers, producers, creators, writers,  expect to be paid for their work - **because it IS actual work** - whether you see it as work or not.

1063,"&gt;The euro would probably never have been created.

The creation of the euro was not inevitable; it was based on the determination of certain member states. They chose to continue with implementing the single currency without all members on board. The UK and Denmark acquiesced to this wish with the caveat of an opt-out. This sounds like a healthy relationship and fair use of opt-out (rather than veto)

&gt;don't get the option to opt out of the euro.

That's because they are signing up to a union that includes the euro. The UK and Denmark joined prior the single currency, so had every right to reject it.

When a company applys the documents for you and take flat fee only if you win the case, it's pretty win win situation.

Not everyone want to apply by them self against the airlines... just because some people dont have patince, some of them have lack of confidence when it comes to opening a file against a company and some just are too lazy :P

1217,"I have issues with that assessment. Even the most hardcore atheists disagree with you. ""Prayer"" in Christianity can mean a few things but generally to the average person refers to attempting to contact and speak to a higher physical being through your thoughts. 

Meditation is not a religious concept at all and is an activity that involves connecting with yourself and being mindful of your own actions, emotions, and psychological well-being. It's not relegated to Buddhism, it was not invented by Buddhists and most people who practise it are not buddhist. Any practitioner of mental health will advise it for those suffering from stress, or anxiety.

&gt;the church did use to provide a sense of community and support.

As opposed to all those other religions who offer not to provide a sense of community and support? 

&gt;the whole new age Buddhism is just rediscovering Christianity under a veneer of ""exotic"", eastern religion (with no small dose of orientalism) palatable to people who like modern multiculturism and like to consider themselves as cosmopolitan, and, as such, inherently distrust and/or dislike Christianity because Christianity has been tied to conservative politics since 1789

Then why hasn't Hinduism become more popular in the west? It's an eastern ""exotic"" religion, an older one, (the predecessor to buddhism) 
and why is it's growth spreading faster in places like America, than in places like the former Soviet states where the Russian orthodox church is the primary returning religion, or the Nordic countries both of which are more secular or distrustful of the church. 

I would say it's attractiveness has more to do with the fact that Buddhism is not a ""religion of the book."" One of its core tenets is impermenance. Everything is susceptible to interpretation and change. Whereas the Judeo-Christian religions survival rely on beating a dogmatic drum of a beat made thousands of years ago, Buddhism aptly can be ""re-incarnated"" and reinterpreted with changing modern times. This can have it's own issues of course to the point that some have even gone as far as described it's ideas as, as loosely formed as a quasi-religion. 

Another point of attractiveness for persons is essentially it's fundamental differences in approach to life than Judeo-Christian teachings. The bible teaches that God is perfect and everything happens for a reason and if a person is suffering it is deserved or a test. The first ""noble truth"" of Buddhism is that life can be imperfect, flawed and full of suffering with no greater reason or meaning to it and that just has to be accepted. I think most people can agree with that. 

There are various branches of Buddhism that are as ""out there"" as some of the Christian or Islamic faiths but overall I think the reason it's taking hold on the west is because generally it's just a more down to earth, non-dogmatic religion that is far more open to question and reform.

Danes did not invite johadis into their country. Danes have never been  given an informed decision on mass immigration; no Western country has, or they would have revolted rather than accept the deluge of hostile people into their neighbourhoods.

&gt; You made them your people

Danes never made them their people, they never wanted to become part of the Danish people, and now they are not Danish people.

&gt; people who have, by your own admittance here, not done anything

So? If I go on a holiday to Japan and abandon my kids there, Japan will repatriate them. 

&gt; have the potential to maybe do something, possibly, but who really knows

Your ignorance is showing. Muslims in general in Europe have outrageously extreme views, largely reject integration, and have a high rate of support for ISIS, close to a majority in those instances. The kids of a dedicated and committed johadi will probably have a certain probability of having an extremist outlook. Muslims in France for example prefer to marry their Moroccan cousing via arranged marriage than find a local bride. This coupled with the fact that they aren't ethnically Danish means that they certainly will not benefit Danes by remaining in the country.

&gt; expunge the undesirables

Who are the undesirables? This is the important thing. If they are actually Danish, then they get to stay, because they are part of the country for better or worse. If they aren't ethnically Danish, that means they are the result of recent immigration (probably), so yes there is absolutely a cause to strip them of citizenship and deport to whatever country they probably have a lot of links with and identify with more (like Iraq or Morocco)",,/r/europe/comments/b6o8zc/denmark_plans_to_deprive_jihadists_children_of/ejmvw0d/,WrathOfAnon,1553833447

Did you not recall anything that happened in Poland?

&gt; Made plans for a government-in-exile and evacuated the government and engaged in appropriate messaging to the public.

They had 1, it was in France and moved to London following the French defeat.

&gt; Moved the Polish army to Franco-British lines if that was where the real battle was intended to be fought.

Completely ignoring the logistics of this whilst also ignoring the signal it would give to Germany to take Poland.

&gt; Evacuated as many people as possible. The Finns pulled people out before the Soviets came through.

To where? They were surrounded by 3 invaders.

At the end of the day when its Europe stacked against Britain, Europe is more powerful in all the meaningful measurements.

Secondly, as if it wasn't bad enough for Britain already, a major component of British internal security is at stake in these negotiations, ie the Good Friday Agreement.  So not only is Britain faced with the task of trying to negotiate a favorable deal when the guy across the table is so much more powerful than it, Britain is also handicapped by this internal security issue which gives it even less room to maneuver in negotiations.  

Basically the cards were completely stacked against Britain from the start, there was no way it would ever achieve what was promised in Brexit campaigns but once again people have to learn that reality trumps campaign promises.

Because the lie, whether by omission or misrepresentation or outright stating something that is false, is comfortable.

1461,"&gt;Well no, what it seems to me is that he's looking around, getting an estimate, and that estimate becomes the finalized tally displayed on the screen?

No, the non-seats screen tally is the anonymous electronic vote. There's generally 3 types of voting in the European parliament, not counting secret ballot and technical difficulty procedures. Hand votes which are just ""judge by sight"", anonymous electronic votes which come out as simply number tallies, and roll call votes which come out as seat placements.  According to the rules of procedure, roll call votes are a bit more ""serious business"", used for final legislation and on request of 40 MPS. Anonymous votes form the bulk of verification votes.  

&gt; I concede that there may be an electronic voting portion, but why bother with counting hands then?  
Speed. The Americans do the same with the voice call system. They also have an electronic system, but they prefer to give significant time for those and it only works in ""roll call"" mode so they also only use it the voice call looks dubious. Admitedly the French and Italian parliaments seem to do only electronic votes, with the French doing anonymous votes (as far as i know) and the Italian doing ""roll call"" voting.  The German parliament is....[weirder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTK8oDEN9IQ), with hand signs, sitting up and down, doorway votes and coloured card votes.

&gt;Also, I'd like to re-state that even after repeated viewings, it seems like the pause after calling the vote seems a bit short for translation. I admit I'm not familiar with how fast translation can happen, but 2-3 seconds seems a bit short?

Primary form of communication is generally the screen, not the translator. And if [these MEPs](https://www.eud.eu/news/interview-two-deaf-meps/) can handle it, I'm not quite sure how anyone can reasonably complain.

1525,"It’s almost 12 am here so I wont be reading the whole thing rn (I’ll come back tomorrow), as I need some sleep. I did read a bit of it, so here are my first thoughts:

In high enough quantities, mercury is dangerous. As is the case with literally any substance, though the threshold for mercury is indeed rather low. Vaccines, however, don’t contain enough to cause harm. 

Here are some quotes from your link which I find relevant: 

&gt; The first real questions regarding thimerosal’s safety were raised in the 1970s, provoked (as will be described in the next section) by rising awareness of the dangers of organic mercury poisoning. Although the latter debate centered on the organomercurial methylmercury found in fish and industrial pollution, ethylmercury did not escape scrutiny. A series of case reports demonstrated the compound’s potential for neurotoxicity when given in large volumes, such as when used as a topical antiseptic to “paint” large omphaloceles.18,19 **These exposures exceeded those in vaccines**, however, by many orders of magnitude. Only one routine infant vaccine in the 1970s, the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis combination, contained thimerosal. *A formal review of thimerosal by the FDA concluded in 1976 that no dangerous quantity of mercury was likely to be received from vaccines and other biological products over a lifetime*.

&gt; The second point concerns the history of mercury poisoning. Central to the public story of thimerosal has been a battle over the meaning of “mercury.” Those in the scientific community take it as axiomatic that **all forms of mercury are not created equal**; *in particular, there are good reasons to believe that the ethylmercury used in vaccines is very different from the methylmercury studied in environmental science*. In public discourse, however, such distinctions are subsumed under a single entity, mercury, with a long and very public history. *Perhaps unfairly, history has endowed mercury in all of its forms with a notoriety that is not easy to erase, as will quickly be discovered by any pediatrician trying to convince an anxious mother that a “trace” of mercury in a vaccine is safe.*

They are investiganting her for allegedly pressuring a former MP named Sebastian Ghita to pay for a private jet used to bring a guy named Nicolae Popa, convicted for running a massive ponzi scheme, back to Romania from Indonesia where he was arrested on an Interpol warrant.

Ghita reported this in 2017 and the issue was investigated by the Romanian AG’s office. They found no wrong doing. In fact, the Romanian Police confirmed that the cost of the plane used to bring that guy here was covered entitely by them and that a public auction was held to contract the plane itself.

Now this Ghita guy is a real piece of work in his own right. He was convicted on corruption charges and fled the country crossing into Serbia. The Serbs had no issue sending him back, but our government never finalised the extradition process. Why? He was a PSD MP and is pretty tight with Dragnea. He also owns and finances Romania TV, a propaganda machine worse than Fox News and RT combined. PSD needs said propaganda machine to keep their supporters in line. Plus, Ghita probably has some pretty serious dirt on his ‘friends’.

Meanwhile, the Minister of Justice, as asked by Dragnea, wrote and passed (along with our incredibly stupid puppet PM) an emergency order that brought changes to the criminal code. I won’t bother you with the details, but that EO led to some definitive sentences being overturned and corruption convicts having to be retried.

1649,"&gt; Supposedly the goal was to keep inflation below 2%. 

What you said can be misinterpreted. The negative rates were not to contain inflation below 2%, but to increase inflation to below 2%. Inflation was too low, so the Riksbank lowered interest rates, so people and investors would be more prone to investing in the economy and in riskier assets in search for a better yield, instead of in government bonds or deposits which provided very paltry returns, all to stimulate economic activity and increase inflation. 

One of the problems is also the fact that Sweden, like all very close partners of the Euro Area, does not truly have a fully independent monetary policy, no matter how much people want to believe that not joining the Euro Area gives monetary independence. The Riksbank cannot suddenly increase rates (significantly) even if it wanted, as long as the ECB doesn’t do the same. There’s a cap on how much the Riksbank can deviate from the ECB. And I do not mean a legal, or declared, or official cap, or even a “fixed, immutable” cap, but a simple cap imposed by economic consideration. 

As Nordea Bank said:

&gt; We expect unchanged policy and no new signals. The Riksbank will hardly see any domestic reasons for hiking the rate in the next few years. We see a repo rate hike in December 2019 because we judge that the Riksbank *will shadow the ECB*.

The same happened to the SNB (Swiss National Bank) in 2015 after the ECB started QE. At that point it was no longer economically possible for the SNB to maintain the fixed exchange rate between the Swiss Franc and the Euro, the massive increase in the balance sheet of the SNB required to keep the fixed exchange rate was starting to undermine trust in the SNB itself, and the SNB was forced to give up on the fixed exchange rate. Whether people like it or not, the Euro Area and the ECB are simply too strong and too relevant, too influencing for their decisions to not have very big repercussions even for EU members or even non-EU European Countries that are not part of the Euro Area. 

Personally, I would prefer to be in the Euro Area and possibly lose “monetary policy independence”, if it meant I could be at the table where the decisions regarding the Euro Area are made, since those decisions influence me so much anyway. But that’s just my opinion.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/b3wn6k/purchasing_power_in_europe/ejlobwu/,Etain05,1553803160

Then we saw what happened to France and crapped our pants.  We also noticed that the French commander on the Italian border refused to surrender because the Italians couldn't do shit against a fortified position in the mountains.  His refusal to surrender actually prevented an armistice for awhile.

Puerto Ricans didn't become citizens after a long process, they got it in 1917 so they could be drafted.  The only real independence movement was to avoid a draft. Since the 1950s they've had referendums to be independent, a state, or keep it as it is.

I fundamentally think that really only Swiss and to some extent Germans can grasp this easily because the sovereign power is split between the feds and the states. The federal government derives its power from the people, working through the states. States have certain sovereign powers, among those being the election of representatives, senators, and electors. Puerto Rico, repeatedly democratically deciding to not become a state, does not have those powers.

1781,"The same could be said about any national legislation being passed against the opposition of a single region or area (which happens more often that not in most of our countries). That's just how democracy works. It's not perfect, but waiting for decisions to be unanimous means you can't do anything worthwhile, and you end up stuck in a perpetual state of status quo, lagging being everyone else, which ultimately lead to stagnation, or disaster.

I mean look at what's happening in the UK right now, they don't even need it to be unanimous, they only need a majority to support a plan, any plan to get out of a highly destructive mess, and they can't even agree on this between themselves. It speaks volumes about the complexity of any democratic system.

Now, regarding your (very understandable) grief about the copyright directive, it's worth noting that directives, while mandatory, are guidelines, and as such, member states enjoy a great deal of freedom in the actual implementation in their national legislation.

It's also worth noting, and it's a very important point because you're misguided about this, that French and German MEPs together only represent 22% of the European parliament. So they certainly don't decide by themselves of the outcome, even if they voted unanimously (which isn't even remotely the case). Additionally, as several people have pointed out already, smaller countries enjoy a higher number of representatives, proportionally to their population. One example was about how, quoting, ""*the individual vote of an Estonian counts for more than the votes of 4 individual Germans*"". Which is, to the best of my knowledge, absolutely unheard of in any instance of democracy around the world and throughout history. 

The EU is incredibly attached to the diversity of opinions and representativity of its minorities, it's part of its DNA, and a great deal of time and effort is invested in reaching compromises. But when setting up the collective rules we want to abide by, you cannot expect the few to perpetually block the will of the many.

Let's say you want to independently decide on a copyright legislation. It means leaving the EU. Which means not being able to voice your opinion and participate in the European legislative process anymore. I mean okay, why not. Except you'd still have to abide by EU legislation, because the EU wouldn't allow your country to have its companies conventiently protected by European law, while European companies aren't as much protected in your own country. That's just logical, and fair. So you essentially end up with zero practical benefit, only downsides.

Which is, by the way exactly what is already happening right now with the UK, even though it's not even out of the EU yet. The US warned the Brits that if they'd expect to cut a trade deal, they'd have to abide by the US legislation. And because the US so vastly outweights the UK, the latter won't have any choice but fall in, or not get a deal.

That's why people need to realize that the EU isn't just about getting wealthier. It's first and foremost about securing our overall independence on a global stage where continental superpowers like China and the US are the main actors and able to impose their will on weaker, smaller entities. That's why I'd very much rather share my own part of sovereignty with my neighbours, and have a few disagreements with them, than be subdued to a wholy different set of legal, societal and cultural values.

1793,"&gt; That you somehow understand that there needs to be clear evidence for human-caused climate change, and none of them actually understand that that's the case. 

If you are going to enact global political changes, you need to have definitive evidence. Are carbon emissions responsible for the climate changing? Maybe a part of it. Is it the most significant vehicle? I doubt it.

 I would bet [the active volcanoes under Antarctica](https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=295861&amp;org=NSF&amp;from=news) have something to do with it. This, along with the dynamic tilt of earth’s axis and the fact that we are in the period between ice ages are all contributing factors.

Your side has the burden of proof because you are attempting to use this as an excuse to enact radical political change. 

And it doesn’t do you any favors to call those who are, in fact, looking at ALL contributing factors, as opposed to your naive assessment that CO2 emissions are the sole cause, somehow less educated.

&gt; You're way overstepping your expertise on the subject by claiming that they aren't doing their job properly, especially since you don't actually seem to be able to come up with alternative explanations for the current warming that is going on.

I just did.

———

The earth has undergone radical changes since its formation. 99% of all species that have ever lived on this planet are extinct, many due to sudden, catastrophic traumas. To think that you can alter the climate of a planet with current technology is ridiculous.

Survival of the species is not dependent on preventing climate change. Rather, it depends on acquiring technology that ALLOWS us to alter climate to ensure greater habitability on other planets.

So in summary:

No, not everyone agrees that carbon emissions are the sole cause of climate dynamism.

Forcing me to pay additional taxes is not going to prevent the climate from changing.

1883,"With regards to small creators, the idea is that while major publishers already have the legal and monetary capabilities to control distribution and punish copyright breaches, e.g. by DMCA complaints (which work because the internet is dominated by American websites) and lawsuits, smaller actors can't follow the same approach - at least, that's been my impression from hearing about content creators on YouTube who got their content stolen but were unable to do anything about it. With this directive, the hope is that it creates new instances for complaints (i.e., you can raise issues with EU institutions as arbiters, rather than YouTube), which makes it less likely to be ignored and more likely to be fair - it takes away the self-regulatory aspect. That said, I'm not a content creator myself, and I don't have any hard data to back up my position on this, so take it with a grain of salt; it's simply how I rationalise things.

&amp;#x200B;

It's true that the directive only applies to EU, but because the EU is such a huge and influential regulatory body, we have the [Brussels Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_effect) coming into play - organisations choose to adopt to EU regulation even without legal requirements simply because it's practical.

&amp;#x200B;

The point on journalism is very interesting, and I actually don't think it's that naive. One of the reasons why we're seeing more and more biased (and generally worse) reporting along the lines of Fox News is that news organisations are forced to seek corporate sponsorship to survive - there simply isn't enough money in the business these days, with everyone getting their news from third parties. When you see a news article shared on Facebook or Reddit, do you actually click through and read the whole thing, or are you satisfied with the title and short excerpt you'll see automatically (or, in Reddit's case, the autotldr bot)? I'd wager most choose the latter, and so the organisation actually responsible for the article sees none of the money. I do think there's a grey area here though - I think it's unfair to demand everyone to have a license, but I also think it's perfectly reasonable to say that, for example, Google News and other aggregators pay their share - at least when they go beyond the title of the article. It's a shame the directive makes little distinction here, although I guess it's also to avoid organisations to skirt the rules by, again using Fox News as an example, claiming to be an ""entertainment media"" and not primarily dealing with news.

Constitutional rights are not up for local mob rule. 51% of people in a town or city cannot decide to violate the constitutional rights of the other half.

What those people hate is the idea that, if people ""lower on the totem pole"" as of now get equal rights to them that *they* might end up lower in the hierarchy overall.

That's where this fear of ""the natural order being upset"" comes from. When those people, who are lower on the social hierarchy because they deserve to be there, can rise up - does that mean I could be treated by them the way I treat them now in the future?

Before for example LGBT groups the exact same fears and hatred existed towards Black people. Before then it was women. Before that (especially in Europe) it was democratic movements in general.

*All of that still lingers*, especially in the US. Because all of it violates the ""natural order"" that some groups try to propagate, in which your position on the social hierarchy is determined by gender, color of skin or sexuality.

It's current legal status is that its a creation of the federal government.

How can a small creator prevent their content from being shared without automated content filtering everywhere?

BTW, as I understand it, the directive does not apply to non-EU websites (correct me if I'm wrong).

Today, I read an opinion piece in Gazeta Wyborcza (largest Polish daily) in which the author explained what he believed to be the purpose of the directive: People are not reading newspapers, but are using Facebook and other online platforms instead.

For comparison, the independence party (IPU) had 0.46% of votes and the Pirate party had 0.85% of votes. Even if the communists were united in a single party (what was the communist motto again? 🤔), they would not be the top party even amongst these minority groups.

They never usually get any publicity, but during the elections there is always the minor party debate, where all the leaders of these minority parties are invited, communists included.

The physical voting action was irrelevant to my comment.  The statement I made compared the time required to *make an informed decision* to the time required to press a button.

&gt; Being a parliamentarian is a job, you can fuck it up., and trying to idiot proof it just makes it harder for everyone else to do their job properly.

I'm pretty comfortable saying that if incorrect directives with significant impact are being passed at an EP level due to MEP errors, then it's probably pretty safe to say that it's time for procedural change to the European Parliament.

The cost of a miniscule amount of a legislator's time is irrelevant compared to the costs imposed by implementing that directive.

2292,"&gt; What you're leaving out from your explanation is that right now Youtube is NOT held responsible when they do things through these steps. 

They can be held responsible **if they don't do the steps**. 

&gt; Under the new system THEY CAN BE, so Youtube will do everything in their power to set up a system that that can't happen.

Youtube already have everything they need in place. 

YouTube is already art 17 compliant.

Only change there will be is the redress system.

&gt; Youtube will now be held liable. You need to understand this. Being held liable is very very dangerous for companies like Youtube and they will do anything to not be liable

Held liable is very dangerous for any company or person. 

&gt; If this means that they will take a video down on a single report, then that's the way it's going to be.

They already do

&gt; No amount of systems of redress is going to matter, because Youtube does not have to explain why they took a video down nor are they obligated to publish any video.

Why would they not have a video up that was **officially cleared out copyright violation**?

&gt; Yes, they managed to bully Google and lobby enough political power to force Google's hand.

You are being biased here.

They win in the court, and you refer as ""bully"" and ""lobby"".

They won in court because they managed to prove that Google was making money off their work and not paying them. How is this bully?

You can't treat Google as if they were a charity. They aren't. 

&gt; This legislation is for the same reason: so that more and more rights holders can force their will onto Youtube.

They can't ""force their will"". That's not how it works, and just like in the ""bully"" example since you are using an inflammatory language which is not true and is biased.

&gt; At the end of the day it's the independent creators and users that have to pay for all of this bullshit while getting nothing out of it.

Independent creators will have the redress mechanism and the copyright sharing system.

&gt; This type of stuff is probably why Google got involved in lobbying themselves, so that they wouldn't fall prey to this again.

Again, you are treating Google as if they were a charity. A ""Google is good"" and ""Copyright holders bad"" point of view. Both have rights and obligations.

No amount of lobbying would change the fact that YouTube was making money of music and music videos uploaded to YouTube.

Arguing ""we can keep this money because we didn't upload it, the user did"" excuse didn't fly with the court. 

And yet, you assume they were ""bullied"" and were victims here.

&gt; Youtube has so much user generated content that if every single case requires even a simple ""okay"" from a lawyer then they would need to hire more lawyers than engineers.

They don't need it under art 17 either.

Art 17 requires them to have a reasonable system in place to deal with copyright dispute. Which they already do.

&gt; If you give them a notice, they will take it down, precisely so that they would not have to deal with it legally. Under the current rules, they're not liable. Under the new rules they are.

You seem to be overestimating just how liable get are. They are liable to have a system in place, which they do.

They are not liable for ""this video got through the crack, now pay us 20 millions"". This is not the case.

2332,"Just a friendly reminder that Arlene foster (The leader of the DUP, who has had an inordinately large say on proceedings to date) isn't an MP or an MEP.

She's an [MLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(Northern_Ireland)), and the supposed leader of a government that hasn't existed for [801 days](https://howlonghasnorthernirelandnothadagovernment.com/). 

The reason it hasn't sat for so long is because she was involved in a [corruption scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_Heat_Incentive_scandal) and so Sinn Fein will not sit in government with her specifically. They'll sit with someone else. Just not her. 

But she refuses to step down as party leader, and somehow her party the DUP feel this is acceptable.

Arlene Foster is personally responsible for the lack of a local government in Northern Ireland for over 2 years.

2368,"Sending a battleship within range of the coastline of a hostile power without overwhelming air superiority would have been nuts, especially given the state of the Royal Navy's capital ships in September 1939.

Of the fifteen battleships and battlecruisers in operation at the onset of the war, only five would have been fast enough to take part in a raiding action against the German coast - *Rodney*, *Nelson*, *Hood*, *Repulse*, and *Renown*. But all of these fast units were needed to protect against German commerce raiders in case they broke out into the Atlantic and threatened supply lines to the Empire, as the remaining ten battleships weren't really fast enough to get involved in that sort of fight.

Secondly, as shown several times throughout the war, air and submarine power were both serious threats even to modern battleships. *Prince of Wales*, which was basically brand new, and *Repulse* were both sunk by aircraft off of Singapore. The older *Royal Oak* was sunk at anchor by a U-boat right at the start of the war. To add to these threats was the heavy mining of the North Sea, making it difficult to traverse.

So, the Royal Navy would have had to have sent the most valuable third of its capital ship fleet into range of overwhelming enemy air power, through minefields, and risking submarine attack, in order to shell some cities. This would have taken place before the Blitz, so it would have been a clear propaganda victory for Germany given the inevitable civilian casualties and collateral damage, and would have had minimal strategic value given that half of Germany's ports lay in the Baltic, but could have resulted in the destruction of all of the Royal Navy's most valuable capital ships. Yeah, great idea!

Britain was not ready to fight in September 1939, and France even less so, despite massive rearmament programmes. It's easy to say that the war could have been ended quickly by a decisive assault over the Maginot Line, but difficult to see how either the UK or France could have maintained that momentum with the state of their equipment and personnel.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/b68cjm/manifesto_in_front_of_british_embassy_in_warsaw/ejk0me3/,intergrav,1553753936

2478,"We can be reconciled or you can stop the very least understand my point of view depending on how in depth your knowledge is of Spanish politics. I don't like nationalist of any sort regardless of whether they are Spanish, Catalan, or any other. Saying that Spain is authoritarian in it's approach towards Catalonia is a misuse of the word authoritarian but it also makes me wonder how much you've followed Spain over the last 12 months at the very least. Likewise I think the word oppressive is being misused. 

One can say that Rajoy and Puidgemont goofed up on the first of October given both of their statements and thoughts but calling Rajoy's response to the referendum  and subsequent  udi lacks context. Both were looking for a political victory and neither want to go all the way to 100% according to statements from the trial. 

Likewise I think it's absolutely ridiculous to say Sánchez or Iglesias can be considered anything close to authoritarian or oppressive. If you still want to say that  then you are free to do so but I'll think you don't follow Spanish politics if you think the country(or Catalonia) is a hive mind ideologically and politically. One of them has been president for the past year. Had this been a different time period without the country being hyper politicized due to the first of October then I think the current president would have been able to reach a political solution involving a social or economic agreement.

Casado and Abascal are truly the closest to being oppressive and hopefully they won't take power. The latter is trigger and in my opinion he just talks and doesn't think about what he's saying. Bad quality for a potential leader since he would definitely make the situation worse. Abascal on the other hand is unabashed with his fondness for Franco. He would arrest the Catalan politicians for speaking about it which would lead to riots. 

The other person, Rivera, would pick fights with them until he fills justified in suspending autonomous powers.  Last week, we saw that play out over ribbons because political symbols can't be displayed on public buildings during election season. Both sides continued to escalate. One side compared themselves to Jews during the Holocaust while the other side continued pressing for charges to pressed because the other leader didn't discard the symbols fast enough.

2498,"&gt; ""People on YT"" can't do the things I listed, nobody can. Making YT videos are not the only work musicians have to do when they create and distribute content. Musicians on their own that only make music and put it on YT don't get minimum living wage from their music, best case scenario it's a way to get recognition from professionnals. I don't even know an exception to this rule.
&gt; 
&gt; 

You think the millions of dollars that Gangam Style made in ad revenue is not enough to even cover minimum wage?

&gt;It's difficult for an independent artist to do anything, because there's a lot to be done when you're a musician, because there are more music being made than any human could listen to in a lifetime and we now have access to most of it.

Sure, but organizations such as RIAA aren't the ones that make a piece of music popular. The artists still need other people to do all of that. On the other hand, such organizations are still going to take their piece of the pie.

&gt;and organizations like collective collect of copyright agencies are an entirely different part of the industry and they defend independant companies and unsigned artists as well.

Oh yeah? So where are they whenever independent artists or similar are in trouble? Nowhere, because it's not their obligation to help.

&gt;No, not force, licences are going to be negociated

Yeah, ""negotiated"" and if Youtube doesn't accept the deal then they can sue Youtube and say that Youtube is not ""doing its best effort"".

&gt;So if they get ""extra money"" they have to share it just the same (so it's not extra).

But it is extra. The same share from a larger amount of money is still more money. Furthermore, they'll just say that they need more resources to do all of these deals with the platforms, thus they need a larger share.

&gt;You seem to link rightholders solely to MCNs, that's only a really really small fraction of rightholders that where specifically designed for YT, they don't have much in common with the rest.

MCNs are a great example, because they tried to set up the same type of situation on Youtube as exists on TV and radio with the rights holder organizations. However, we got lucky that they were unable to grab enough of a hold on the situation.

&gt;Yeah if you want them to redistribute to you royalties claims, you have to ask them to handle your copyrights, but you said ""puts a whole bunch of rules on those creators"", that's the part I didn't get.

If you are part of *any* organization there are rules you must follow. They can kick you out if they don't like you. Usually in practice these types of situations are corrupt as fuck. 

I find it laughable that you see nothing wrong with the situation, where everyone has to pay a tax ""to help the artists"" but it's only paid out to artists who join a specific organization. I guess all those other artists don't matter.

**Egypt**

&gt;""Our aim is the full restoration of the rights of the Palestinian people. In other words, we aim at the destruction of the State of Israel. The immediate aim: perfection of Arab military might. The national aim: the eradication of Israel."" – President Nasser of Egypt, November 18, **1965** ( Wait a minute... but I thought it was a war of Israeli aggression? But that's two years before... nevermind. )

&gt;""We are now ready to confront Israel .... The issue now at hand is not the Gulf of Aqaba, the Straits of Tiran, or the withdrawal of UNEF, but the ... aggression which took place in Palestine ... with the collaboration of Britain and the United States."" – Nasser, June 2, 1967 ""

&gt;""May 19, 1967: ""This is our chance Arabs, to deal Israel a mortal blow of annihilation, to blot out its entire presence in our holy land""  - Radio Cairo

**Jordan**

There is no difference between one Arab people and another, no difference between one Arab army and another."" – King Hussein of Jordan, after signing the pact with Egypt May 30, 1967

**Iraq**

&gt;""The existence of Israel is an error which must be rectified. This is our opportunity to wipe out the ignominy which has been with us since 1948. Our goal is clear – to wipe Israel off the map. We shall, God willing, meet in Tel Aviv and Haifa."" – President Abdel Rahman Aref of Iraq, May 31, 1967 ""

**Palestinian Leadership**

&gt;""This is a fight for the homeland – it is either us or the Israelis. There is no middle road. **The Jews of Palestine will have to leave. We will facilitate their departure to their former homes**. Any of the old Palestine Jewish population who survive may stay, **but it is my impression that none of them will survive**."" – Shukairy, June 1, 1967 

&gt;""""We shall destroy Israel and its inhabitants and as for the survivors – if there are any – the boats are ready to deport them."" –  Shukairy, June 1, 1967, speaking at a Friday sermon in Jerusalem""

**Syria** 

&gt;Syria's forces are ""ready not only to repulse the aggression, but to initiate the act of liberation itself, and to explode the Zionist presence in the Arab homeland. The Syrian army, with its finger on the trigger, is united.... I as a military man, believe that the time has come to enter into a battle of annihilation."" – Syrian Defense Minister **Hafez Assad**, May 20, 1967 ( Well well, look who's sharing his official legal opinion concerning the 'liberation' of land through war with us. )

It's difficult for an independent artist to do anything, because there's a lot to be done when you're a musician, because there are more music being made than any human could listen to in a lifetime and we now have access to most of it. Right holders are there to help artists through that, they didn't create this situation, I understand concerns about saturation of the market and the communication power of Universal/Sony/warner, but that's not going to change with this directive, and organizations like collective collect of copyright agencies are an entirely different part of the industry and they defend independant companies and unsigned artists as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Because now more rights holder organizations can force Youtube to pay them extra money. 

No, not force, licences are going to be negociated, and that doesn't change anything for the percentage they share with the artists, that's not a free negotiation, there are laws to prevent abusive licencing, and minimums fixed for the percentage they get/redistribute to artists. So if they get ""extra money"" they have to share it just the same (so it's not extra).

Isn't that the Scottish government? Do you also feel the need to qualify Westminster as the Tory/DUP government?

Westminster also publishes GERS of which 96% of the data is guestimates or voluntary studies. 

And rather than suggesting foul play as you do, I go ahead and say Westminster has been dishonest when it was deemed politically expedient

51% wants something else. When they then have to decide what that something else should be, it some want curry, some want sushi, some want kebab. And it turns out that there is no majority for the something else.

The brexit vote was a protest vote. It was the vote for something else, something other than the status quo.  
The something else has now been negotiated (at least partially) - it is the withdrawal agreement.  Is there a majority of people who want *this* something else? We don’t know - that would require asking people again.
In lieu of asking the people we can ask the people’s representatives. The people’s representatives have not approved the something else.

Taking into account the indicative vote results released just minutes ago, the representatives do not agree in a majority on anything. 

So whose vote should count the most? The 49% of the people who knew they wanted pizza, or the three something else groups making up 51%, who do not agree on what they want.

You're not reading. It is NOT lifted. There were a bunch of requirements and legal pressure that can only be solved with filters. That is still there.

That's bullshit. Even now illegal stuff you post will be taken down or the platform gets punished. This just redirects the crime to the owner of the platform, and not just the one that uploaded it.

Your last paragraph is quite the strawman.  You sure showed Mr Strawman.  That type of discrediting is actually a textbook Nazi (not the leftist everyone is a Nazi type bit the real served-under-Hitler-in-the-1940s kind) tactic.

&gt;In the 19th century, Southern Democrats were whites in the South who believed in Jeffersonian democracy. In the 1850s they defended slavery in the United States, and promoted its expansion into the West against northern Free Soil opposition. The United States presidential election of 1860 formalized the split, and brought the American Civil War. After Reconstruction ended in the late 1870s they controlled all the Southern states and disenfranchised blacks (who were Republicans). The ""Solid South"" gave nearly all its electoral votes to Democrats in presidential elections. Republicans seldom were elected to office outside some Appalachian mountain districts and a few heavily German-American counties of Texas.[a]

And from your wikipedia page:

&gt;The first Klan flourished in the Southern United Statesin the late 1860s, then died out by the early 1870s. It sought to overthrow the Republican state governments in the South, especially by using violence against African-American leaders. Each chapter was largely autonomous and highly secret as to membership and plans. Its numerous chapters across the South were suppressed around 1871, through federal law enforcement. Members made their own, often colorful, costumes: robes, masks and conical hats, designed to be terrifying and to hide their identities.[16][17]

From the same article:

&gt;The third and current manifestation of the KKK emerged after 1950, in the form of localized and isolated groups that use the KKK name. They have focused on opposition to the civil rights movement, often using violence and murder to suppress activists. It is classified as a hate group by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center.[18] As of 2016, the Anti-Defamation League puts total KKK membership nationwide at around 3,000, while the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) puts it at 6,000 members total.[19]

It is on government record in the US that the Democrats voted against the Civil Rights act in 1964.  They also voted against emancipation.

Left or right, the Democrats have always been extremists, and, as recent political and media events have shown, dishonest.

The right and left in Europe over the course of the the 20th century are both guilty of the worst atrocities the world has ever seen. But trying to separate the Nazis and the Communists into groups with different levels of morality is daft.  Both were murderous and highly tyrannical. And yes...the Nazis were left wing, Hitler just moved them more toward fascistic governance after taking the party over.  Socialists tend to sperg out over this because they just can't have anything in common with the National Socialist party.

2793,"&gt;First off, what is the point of this statement? You're biased, I'm biased, yes that's how humans work. And then we debate the facts. There is no such thing as an impartial debate.

The point is that his whole original point was that people should be free to vote on whether they leave the EU or not and should have the freedom of choice, and then he goes and proposes the most one-sided, biased referendum question ever, intentionally designed to trigger people's emotions and make them vote the way he wants to. It undermines his whole point, and prove that he doesn't give a shit about giving people actual choice, he just wants them to vote the way he wants. 

&gt;You're just calling it uninformed and dumb because it doesn't agree with you. The EU is no cure-all for economic ills or an undeniable boon on your society: Spain, Italy, and Greece all feature economies in shit states, and France has been on the ropes. So yeah, it is perfectly reasonable to consider the economic benefits of membership to not be so great so as to outweigh the national benefits of sovereignty and self-determination.

I never said the EU was good, or that remaining was better than leaving or vice versa. My point is that the average person on the street doesn't know enough about the issue one way or another, and can't be expected to know the ins and outs and all the advantages and disadvantages of EU membership. And when you force people to vote on something they are not informed about, the result is an uneducated, uninformed vote. This isn't rocket science, it's basic common sense. I'm not pro or anti EU, I'm just anti uninformed and uneducated votes deciding the future of a whole generation of people, many of which had no say in the matter (UK youth who were too young to vote but will be affected by Brexit).

&gt;It is well known that the chief peril of democracy is an uninformed public, but the alternative is an authoritarian state, which has its own laundry list of issues. At the very least, in a democracy the nation's public decide their own fate and get the bed they made, rather than single cabal or despot doing so.

I'm sorry, but this is 100% false. There is a whole world of possibility between an uninformed public and an authoritarian state, and you stating that those are the only two alternatives is misleading and false. You can have a responsive, democratic, and accountable government that does the will of the people without putting monumental, life-changing decisions to the whim of the common person, who is in no position to fully grasp the nuances and complexity of the issue he's asked to vote on.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/b61zqi/times_cartoon_mps_take_control/ejj0twx/,emergency_poncho,1553723960

2811,"&gt; If you walk into any statistics course and calculate the median for a cardinal dataset you'll simply get no points for it

It doesn't matter what you get points for in what sounds like a course that is at best needlessly prescriptive and at worst outright wrong.

It feels like a dick move to 'pull rank' over levels of academia, but what gets you points in a stats 101 course and how you use statistical methods to analyse real data for research purposes aren't necessarily the same thing, and from your example it sounds like they are actively at odds.  


It's like if you are asked to describe the dimensions of an object that's 10 feet tall and 5 feet wide, and you tell me ""Well if you say it's 5 feet wide you won't get any points. Height is the correct measure"". Both measures are useful and one cannot replace the other.

Was leased after US invaded Cuba and installed its own puppet regime. Cuba wants it back, and they're occupying it nonetheless.

It's a colony but of course, that's a grey area. There are other colonies too but they're also grey areas.

Not really. They don't exercise the same rights when it comes to US elections, place is not part of many stuff US states are. Again, that's a colony. Sure, that's a bit different than other occupations of course.

The UK rebate is calculated to return 2/3rds of the UK's net contribution on the GNI/VAT based own resources system, because otherwise the UK would be contributing a similar amount to France while getting far less EU spending (the RoI would be 1 in 6 rather than 1 in 2, making the UK's net contribution by far the biggest in the EU). It exists because the way the EU takes in revenue isn't designed to deal with a country for which the EU does so little, and the result was becoming more and more absurd.

For example, Poland and Russia took territory from Germany after WW2 and it was recognized by the international community. The US, China, Russia and Korea took territory from Japan after WW2. Likewise, Syria (and other Arab nations) were the aggressors in the 1967 war. They started the war with a blockade of Israel and by massing troops on the border preparing for an invasion. A blockade is an act of war. Since Syria was one of the aggressors, Israel has the right to keep the land it conquered from the aggressor. This is done to deter aggressors from starting a war. The aggressors get punished with territorial losses. 

The bad behavior was Syria's and Egypt's for starting the 1967 war by blockading the Straits of Tiran to israeli shipping in violation of international maritime law, mobilizing their armies, and forcibly removing the UN peacekeepers on the israeli border.

Israel offered to give Golan back to Syria in exchange for a peace treaty 4 separate times. They refused in every case, because they chose eternal war over everything else. The result is now that Golan has been in israeli hands longer than it ever was in Syrian hands. Syria had many chances to get Golan back.

2919,"&gt;Worth pointing out that the EU is doing their very best to get rid of all those bilateral agreements that the Swiss spent decades creating. 

It was and is a two way street though. The EU an CH have been building those bilateral agreements together in the past few decades. This worked so far, but I think both sides are less and less inclined to create new bilateral agreements. I too believe that CH will face their own sort of Brexit choice.

On the EU side, there is a feeling that CH is currently at max capacity having their cake and eat it. CH meanwhile feels that all those agreements limit them in making autonomous/sovereign decisions. CH is trying to renegotiate some of those agreements to enhance their decision making capabilities. The EU on their part get the feeling that CH doesn't offer a lot (if any) of reciprocity. The EU meanwhile wants those agreements to be tit-for-tat. Brexit is, as we speak, putting more and more pressure on those talks.

If someone doesn't move first, a guillotine clause will be triggered and CH will be very very sovereign. And decades worth of agreements will have to be redone.

Now. 

&gt; Why, when they are not affected by it? A hint that Google doesn't benefit from this is because they are against this Directive.

This is faulty reasoning, a non-sequitur. Google can benefit from it more than some others and still be against it. Why? Because it imposes a cost on them that they wouldn't otherwise have to deal with and that cost is the implementation of censorship mechanisms on a never-before-seen scale. That takes time and money and it reduces their traffic volume even after the implementation.   
But small European new media companies are affected far worse by this because they have no way at all to develop these kinds of mechanisms. So their only choice is to exist at all as a company or to wait and then license these kinds of filters from large companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft.

&gt; Read the damn thing. 

Experts agree that the consequences of this bill, **by necessity**, go far past what is explicitly and directly called for, because the guidelines set out in it can't be implemented without the aforementioned drastic censorship mechanisms. That they by and in themselves aren't mentioned in the directive doesn't change that one iota. Ergo it is you who has fallen for

First off, what is the point of this statement? You're biased, I'm biased, yes that's how humans work. And then we debate the facts. There is no such thing as an impartial debate.

&gt; You also fail spectacularly to refute my argument, that these political issues are extremely complicated and the average person doesn't have the time, resources, or even desire to fully educate themselves on the matter and form an informed opinion on the matter, which leads to an uneducated, easily swayed opinion (as we saw with Brexit).

You're just calling it uninformed and dumb because it doesn't agree with you. The EU is no cure-all for economic ills or an undeniable boon on your society: Spain, Italy, and Greece all feature economies in shit states, and France has been on the ropes. So yeah, it is perfectly reasonable to consider the economic benefits of membership to not be so great so as to outweigh the national benefits of sovereignty and self-determination.

&gt; Finally, your accusation of me being arrogant is laughable and pathetic. According to your logic, I shouldn't rely on a medic expert to diagnose my rare disease and make an informed decision on my behalf, the question ""do you stay bound to your limb which may or may not have a flesh-eating bacteria eating your tissue from the inside out"" is a perfect question to ask the owner of such limb.

Appeal to authority is the most classic example of authoritarian reasoning in the book. ""You don't know any better, you need to concede your thought and choice to [X expert]"". That is an undemocratic line of thought. It is well known that the chief peril of democracy is an uninformed public, but the alternative is an authoritarian state, which has its own laundry list of issues. At the very least, in a democracy the nation's public decide their own fate and get the bed they made, rather than single cabal or despot doing so.

2997,"Populism is a method of dealing with problems, thus no issue is in and of itself populist. Any issue can be resolved in a populist manner, if the first question a government asks isn't ""What's good for my people?"", but rather ""What's going to get me the highest approval rating?"". And yes, every government is populist to some extent. Raising pensions, attacking unpopular groups, wielding against politically powerful groups, those things happen everywhere. But the whole purpose of having a representative democracy is that our representatives can use their knowledge and make decisions, that most people, having not dedicated our careers to the study of political decisions, would disagree with.

It's only in Germany that a you can almost perfectly predict government policy by assuming the'd take the popular option on the issue. Perhaps the only time there's an exception it'd involve a politically powerful special interest (like the media with the new copyright directives) or the opportunity of enrichment (as with the NordStream pipes).

If you doubt me, I can give you a simple proof. Ask yourself, who are the allies of Germany that are widely hated among the population? After all, most of the population doesn't study strategy or foreign policy, so there should be at least one foreign country on which the population and those in power disagree, right? Or does the entire population of Germany consist of experts on foreign policy?

This is why the US, UK and France have too many of those to count. In the whole southern Balkans Turkey is widely held in low esteem, yet every government there counts them among their allies. Poland maintains friendly relations with the current government of Ukraine and it's nationalist allies. With Germany, I honestly don't know who to name.

&gt;When you come back from an international trip, you may be left with a handful of coins in a currency you can't spend at home. While most foreign exchange companies and large banks are willing to buy back international bills, it can be harder to find a home for unneeded coins. Unfortunately, you'll probably have to take a loss on the coins' face value in order to turn them back into money you can use.

You also cant even do mental gymnastics to explain the Suica card.

- This map does not take into account the big difference in Cost of Living
between the cities.

- Wage is only one of many factors that determine the Quality of Life in a 
city. Other factors include: Cost of Living, Safety, Traffic, Pollution, 
Population Density, Access and Quality of Institutions, Access and Quality of Public Services like Healthcare and Education, Access and Quality of Goods and Services, Quality of Infrastructure, Availability and Diversity of Jobs, Social and Welfare support, Personal Freedom and Democracy, and many more. 

For those of you who wonder what is the difference between low wage - low cost of living and high wage - high cost of living. The main difference is that if you have low wage, you would have access to fewer goods and services, only those that can be provided on low price, wheres if you have high wage, you would have access to more goods and services, even if those that can be provided on a low price are provided on a high price. The high wage gives you more alternatives, wheres the low wage gives you fewer alternatives, as there are fewer items on the market.

That the difference is smaller than the STEM difference could suggest that there's more than this. But extrapolating is useless. However, this is just one single difference of behaviour. Perhaps multiple *innate* behavioural and interest differences exist that all contribute to the current disparity. Perhaps not.

It may very well be that young girls prefer x, y, z (generally) over a, b, c, for boys. Then this is reinforced by the parents and surroundings during childhood. Further leading into different paths in life. Part of the reason why a parent might choose a certain method of upbringing that is different  between a son or a daughter could follow from societal norms (dolls for girls, trucks for boys), or because the daughter pointed at a doll in the store, or both. The difference may have been small, but large enough that it gets reinforced during childhood and ultimately resulting in different interests and choice of education/job.

3165,"There are no link tax, that's an outright lie.

The story of the link tax went something like this:

The original version of art 11 (keep in mind directives go through a lot of revisions and amendments) extended the same copyright that video and music have online to written text. 

Some critics pointed out that art 11 was not defining minimum amount of words. Proponents argued that notes, words, frames and size for music, books, movies and pictures also don't have a minimum defined, and it's up to courts to define those minimums.

So the following hypoyhetical was proposed, if you create a link with a copyrighted text eg: www.example.com/once-upon-a-time-a-boy-named-John etc...
So under those circumstances, could one charge royalties to anyone that links there?
Critics argued that under the writing of the law crawlers and links could unintentionally break copyright. Proponents argued that in law, common sense rules and it was not necessary to think of every possible loophole.

So critics activists took this idea and branded art 11 as link tax, to rally people against it.

So, there isn't anything there that ever said there could be a link tax, but an extreme hypothetical if a what-if scenario.

During the first debate of art 11, an amendment was voted in favor that excluded links from copyright, effectively shitting down any possible debate about a link tax.

3171,"&gt; Why is not being a member so horrible?

It's not that not being a member would be terrible. It's the manner in which they're leaving that's terrible.

Leaving the UK basically resets their trade system (because they were part of the EU single market, and all their trade deals were based on that). Trade regulations will go back to the baselines from the WTO, which means some things can't be traded for a while, and other things will have default tariffs. They will need to renegotiate trade deals with the rest of the world... but they'll have far less leverage.

That alone is pretty damaging to agriculture. They're going to lose some companies who will simply move businesses out of the country to avoid the issues (IIRC a few have moved already). It'll be a while before trade gets back to where it was.

Secondly, they'll have no say in EU operations anymore. Relationships with EU member nations are by far the most important to them, and yet they're radically changing all of those relationships all at once. I don't think this will lead to WWIII or anything, but it's far from ideal.

Thirdly, leaving with no deal means there will have to be a ""hard border"" between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. That includes a barrier and a customs stop between the two countries. If you don't know why that's a fucking terrible idea please look up ""The Troubles"" and ""The Good Friday Agreement"". In fact, May's ""backstop"" deal was mostly about the border issue.

&gt; There are some countries in Europe that aren't members like Switzerland and Norway, and they seem to be doing fine.

Given the reasons people gave for leaving (unelected EU parliament, membership dues, and border control among a few other things), NEITHER of those models would satisfy anyone. They don't even address most of the issues that leavers brought up, and they leave the UK in a less powerful position. In fact, anyone who looked at what was happening should immediately conclude that those are not options.

3229,"&gt; No, that's not how the law works, that's not how judges operate

Certainly, judgements that are wholly unreasonable but do follow the letter of the law have never happened...

&gt; article 13 doesn't *necessarily* reflect reality
&gt; but the rule of law doesn't *have* to agree with that

But it might, and that is the fear. The possibility is created. If the most restrictive interpretation shouldn't happen, it just shouldn't be possible to be interpreted that way. Whether or not it is possible for the EU to write it in such a way is not *my* problem, it is *theirs*. Just because *they* can't do it is not a reason for *me* to accept overly restrictive policies.

&gt; exceptions to the article when the subject matter concerned is for non-commercial purposes or doesn't generate significant revenue

Just because the problem is mitigated on my personal scale doesn't prevent it from being applicable to my employer's scale, nor from the scale of the platforms I want to use, and thus it can still effect me. And even if it didn't effect me, that wouldn't be a reason to just accept it.

Content service providers being barred from applying filters that are too restrictive doesn't mean anything. The tech is not on the level where this distinction can be accurately made in an automated way, regardless of what words some politician comes up with.

To answer your main point though, the EU just isn't that big of a deal in the UK, like it is on the European continent. Mainland Britain was not completely devastated by WW2 and as such, the EU and similar institutions are just that, no more than institutions. In Europe however they embody and symbolise peace on the continent through political and economic cooperation.

Before 2016 the EU wasn't really talked about as a major issue. No one really cared about it. If you look at polls from 2005, it's nowhere near a relevant topic. Yeah you had Tory Eurosceptics kicking off with Maastricht, but when Blair came in, Euroscepticism dissipated. 

Only because of the referendum did people start to care one way or another. People who couldn't name a single MEP suddenly claiming to love the European Union, people who only heard about Juncker a few years ago suddenly claiming they've always despised the EU. It happened on both sides, and since the result their views have entrenched and the divisions have increased.

Personally, if we leave with a deal of some sort, not much will change in people's day to day lives. Life inside the EU isn't a utopia, but neither is life outside of it, it's about the same.

3295,"&gt; ""early"" is not defined in relation to the solar noon

Early is most certainly defined in relation to the solar noon, or rather, sunrise and sunset. Those are the only absolute things, the numbers on the clock are just numbers. I could easily get used to 16:00 being the solar noon; then I would probably go to work around 13:00, and if for some reason I needed to get up at 11:00, I would be annoyed: ""It's way too early! The sun doesn't even rise until 11:30!"" And if my workplace insisted that I come to work at 09:00 because 09:00 is 09:00, I would resign and find a job that had a sane schedule with respect to the sun, rather than the nominal numbers on the clock.

&gt; Alternatively we can agree to move all work, school and business schedules one hour earlier

But we already decided the time of these things. If schools start at 08:00, that's because people preferred 08:00 instead of 07:00. Most people don't like having to wake up when it is pitch-black outside. If most people where you live actually want to wake up earlier, I don't see why it wouldn't easily happen organically, without requiring a top-down approach by the government. Indeed, if the government actually moved the clock, I think that's exactly what would happen: people would just gradually start to do things later, so 09:00 would eventually be the new 08:00.

3306,"&gt; So right now uploading a video to youtube would be an act of communication under this directive.

Yes, but the text doesn't say that simply uploading the video, and youtube communicating it its users, makes youtube liable. It only says that youtube giving access to a video to its users is an act of communication.That part of the directive in no way makes filter a requirement.

&gt; So they have to make sure to not even communicate the copyrighted material and uploading like it works now is communicating it as seen above. Also it says right there that the content provider is liable.

You forgot to quote a part there that says : 

""[...]and in any event

(c)acted expeditiously, upon receiving a sufficiently substantiated notice from the rightholders, to disable access to, or to remove from, their websites the notified works or other subject matter, and made best efforts to prevent their future uploads in accordance with point (b). 

So, no, a platform is not liable as soon as it communicates some copyrighted content to the public. It is liable if it fails to remove copyrighted content once it is informed of its existence and if it fails to follow best standards to keep it off its service.

3324,"Back then, Romania was a country in crisis trying to recover from communism. Or, in other words, doing its best to adapt a completely new system, which is extremely difficult for any country. Turkey had its own problems but was much more stable and prosperous than Romania, mainly because it already was a part of the ""system"". However, in following years, Erdoğan happened. Romania was on the path to recovery and even became a part of the EU. We, on the other hand, isolated us further and further from modern world and decided that it would be a very good idea to privatize everything, kill agriculture and erect some concrete abominations instead of fields, oppress people so the ones skilled enough shall leave the country for greener pastures, spend all the money on infrastructure and pocket some of that etc... You may not hear too much about it since the government is heavily cracking down but Turkey has been suffering from a severe financial crisis recently. Let's see what happens after the local elections. Other than blind Erdobots, everyone sees that this is not sustainable and things will go much worse before they go better. All in all, Turkey slowly declined and then started nosediving, while Romania was recovering in the process. Now, unless they're paid in USD/EUR or ""too much"" in Turkish liras, it would probably make more sense for a Turk to live in Romania to provide for his family. 

To put it into perspective, EUR/TRY exchange rate on April 1, 2014 was **2.94** and it is **6.10** as of today. Admittedly, minimum wage has managed to increase during the process. Back then, it was 846 liras (€287) and today it is 2020 liras (€332). However, the prices have been increasing a lot more than that. It is now not surprising to wake up to see Turkish lira lose %5 value throughout the night. Our currency is extremely volatile.

Funnily enough, we also have queues for veggies and fruit now! The government decided to set up some ""regulated sales points"" in many cities, where you can buy a limited amount, which I believe was 3kg per person, of some main veggies and fruit. So, tomato is 4 liras/kg at your supermarket? You go to the sales point where it is probably cheaper and get in the queue. Erdoğan supporters used to accuse previous governments of managing economy terribly and thus people having to queue for basic needs. Of course they never talk about how we got our ass sanctioned to hell due to Cyprus operation back then. Now, those same people thank the government for giving them cheaper products... Well, under normal circumstances, the prices at supermarkets should be even lower than at sales points, but whatever, it is impossible to explain what's wrong with the current government to any AKP-Erdoğan supporter.

Anyways, sorry if this was too much of a rant. This is basically how it goes. Ironically, Turkey looks much more communist today than the countries which actually experienced it. State officials are corrupt and terribly rich; most of people hardly make ends meet; surveillance, oppression and intimidation is going on full force; we are essentially a police state now...

3350,"I had / have a similar issue. It started around age 23 and, as I later found out, ties into issues that have been around since childhood. I find it hard to find enjoyment in this world and see it in a positive light. I find it hard to ignore what happens - even if I can only see a vague outline - and enjoy the small things everyone always talks about. There is so much negative... stuff around and I find it hard to tune out. A combination of career trouble, death of my best friend, and resulting alcoholism drove me to the brink of disaster. I very nearly gave up and I can't really claim to have ""gotten myself"" out of that all on my own.

Because, in that particular moment, another ""me"" - forgotten and figuratively beaten out of me since childhood - re-emerged, along with memories of a painful childhood, memories which are still not fully part of ""me""; I simply don't relate to them and can’t remember those days. That part of me views the world very differently. There's so much hatred and anger in that past that the present, no matter how bad it might be, barely registers as a drop in the ocean. And from that anger and bitterness stems energy and persistence I simply did not know I / this body / however one views this could have. That part of me showed me that one can actually enjoy the small things and find them to matter, if only briefly, before they vanish in a sea of doom and gloom. That the darkness can be as much a safe place to go unnoticed as it can be a thing to fear and avoid. I just do not know how to see or do that myself. I find it hard to let to, hard to accept that life is painful, unfair, and maybe going nowhere. But there's a part of me which can, so I clearly must be able to too. Somehow.

The hardest part, for me at least, is that accepting life also means accepting my memory of the past is flawed – and that many of my issues are deeply personal. That I actually do have memories of extremely painful years which I've repressed, that what I assume I value I might not actually hold dear, that there is anger and resentment buried deep in me, and that there's a whole different version of me, a me which I am more than a little bit afraid of because of that past – a me which is many things I’m not: social, outgoing, opinionated, rash, and at times brutally direct and unafraid. If I could accept that part of myself, I theorize, I could maybe come to see the value in life too - but I'm not sure how. It involves utterly re-evaluing my sense of individuality, of who I am, and everything I have in the past held to be true.

It means giving up what I believe I value and cling to as a framework of myself, to replace those notions with what I do actually value emotionally. It means facing the fact I might be a bad person, might think and believe things I find impractical or - worse - flat out morally or ethically wrong. Most of all it means accepting that who I am underneath my rationale and who I think I am / want to be does not really align. To me, it means most of all, accepting I am not in control and have to let go of my existence. Something I find extremely hard to do since “letting go” usually makes things worse and has in the past been my worst fear (if I let go, I will fail – that’s what was hammered into me, even though rationally I know that’s not at all true).

Now, I'm pretty sure not everyone with such issues is in quite the same position I'm in, because most people don't have an entirely different repressed self lingering in their minds at all times. But I think the underlying mechanics are present in many people coming of age in this world. What one was raised with, what one was taught, and reality end up being two very different beasts and I think that happens with every generation. It's left to us to determine how to fit the pieces together, while at the same time trying to make an existence in a world which seems hell bent on removing the ability or hope of doing that. Time and again, I hear the same question muttered, out of earshot of people who might provide simple answers and quick fixes that everyone knows don't work: ""what's the point to it all"" and “why are we even trying”?

Many people give quick, simple answers that amount to busywork – things to distract the mind with to avoid the harder questions, or fill whatever dissatisfaction is left with some sort of meaning. I do that too to distract myself – it’s a bandaid most and one that constantly peels off. In all honestly, I don’t really have an answer and am more and more beginning to realize I don’t want one. There’s a part of me which can deal with this, a part which can be profoundly wise and insightful, and insanely dumb and narrow-minded, in the same breath. So my ultimate goal is to become more like that, more able to let go, and hope that somehow improves my perception and quality of life. Though the gulf might be too wide to ever mend completely. I have a sense that, with age, the best I’ll manage is a mostly-healed mental scar, but never a complete “me” again. The two halves have diverged too much over the years.

In the interim, I’m dealing with my own problems poorly enough and can, at best, ignore the larger ones in the world and hope they don’t affect me. But I think the deeper truth is that, in order to grow and fill those dark spaces, one does somehow have to let go and let life be as it is. That sounds profound but I’ve no idea how the hell to do that. I find most of my value systems, my ways of evaluating life, are bound into a rational framework I was taught but which is proving… well, not entirely useful in practice. While on the other hand my emotions are a chaotic mess I try to keep at bay, in part out of fear of negative impact, and in part as I do not feel ready or stable to approach them. I’m not sure where I’m going with all this. But what you wrote struck me relatable – by own issues, which revealed a bit soup of deeper problems, started around the same age. Wish I could say it gets better but I can barely say it gets a bit easier without sounding hollow and pretentious.

3479,"I dunno. I don't think it's a fair comparison. Filtering content gets you really close to China. It's a whole other beast compared to prioritizing traffic. Internet in America is essentially the same experience for users in after the FCC's Net Neutrality ruling. Nothing has really changed for us.

No single service or provider based in the United States is abusing power by throttling or prioritizing content in a way that's perceptible to most people. Start-ups in the United States still have just as much opportunity as they did before. And in a year or so there's a possibility that net neutrality can be passed again by the next administration's FCC or even Congress.

No company has the ability to do it effectively filter content before it's uploaded. Not American and especially not European. They can't cope with copyright infringement properly as it is. Filtering content as it's uploaded? Good luck.

2) The uploading user is still liable... And the content-provider was still liable until now...

He basically has to check for licences, it's now legally required to respond to any kind of complaint about copyrighted material (this wasn't exactly a norm in Europe) and if necesary provide proof he has done something to dether further uploads of such material... That doesn't mean complicated and expensive filters necessary;

3) Facebook, Youtube and the big ones will bassicaly not be very affected since they have a complicated filter already in place; There will still be Let's plays (hell, some of them receive games before release dates from devs) and most likely also coversongs unless a copyrighter makes a complaint about such material (which is actually what happened in theory until now) .. The difference is that from now on they will be mandated by law to do so... How this will be implemented on national levels remain to be seen, but from the articles, nothing really changes;

3633,"&gt; There is no proof that this is the war that Homer mentions

Look. I already said Trojan war as Homer said didn't happen. Because according to Homer there were Greek deities who fought in the war. Or a 10-year-long siege (though sieges like this are possible, but not in bronze age), or Ethiopians fighting on Trojan side. 

My theory is that the Piyama Radu dude (he was described as ""adventurous"" and a rascal by Hittites) tried to push a claim on Wilusan throne. This made the Hittites upset and they sent their forces there because Wilusa was vassal of Hittites. Then Greeks probably helped Piyama Radu guy and they most likely won because Hittites send a letter to a King in Wilusa called ""Alaksandu"". Which means Piyama Radu's son became the king after his father usurped the throne. Centuries later the war narrative turns into something else and Homer goes to islands, Western Anatolia to gather information about the war and TA DA we have Illiad.

archeologic evidence also shows that a war happened in Troy. It is the same war. But obviously the war was entirely different.

Also funny how Greeks never mention Hittites. Or Native Anatolians. In Greek mythology, natives of Anatolia either mysteriously disappear or get slaughtered (like Perseus did in Iconium)",Voice of Reason Kara Boğa,/r/europe/comments/b2xl6o/greece_condemns_erdogans_threats_and_hate_speech/ejh24he/,Thephalanx23,1553659648

3688,"&gt; Why is 'feeling welcome' important?

How could it not be? Starting a university education is a pretty stressful process, and in my (anecdotal) experience, a large portion of students quit early on because it becomes too much to handle. If specifically women are being made to feel unwelcome (intentionally or not), it's logical that a higher portion of them would quit, and perhaps pursue their interests in a way that doesn't make it a negative experience.  

There's a lot of interests that can be pursued both through a university education and on one's own. The advantage of a university education, amongst other things, is getting a degree demonstrating one's qualification within a subject, which you aren't gonna receive by pursuing the interest in your own time. The question is whether that's worth making the pursuit of your interest an unpleasant and negative experience, which of course for many people isn't.

3710,"&gt;Article 11 just extends existing rights to press publications. Because people were concerned this could have an impact on sharing links, the legislator explicitly added an exception for links just to eliminate any ambiguity.

Right, but people are still concerned that it restricts the sharing of news stories (headline and summary with a link, or potentially just the headline) in a way that is unreasonable. That's what the 'link tax' refers to. 

Whereas previously you were generally seen as safe in taking a headline and a link, or a headline, summary and link, that is no longer the case (because Article 11 was explicitly intended to deal with the issue of news site content being presented on other sites, people just reading the headlines and browsing past, rather than having to visit the publishers website and so potentially provide advertising revenue). The entire rationale behind extending those rights is to ensure that publishers content is either licensed or viewed on the news publications site.

&gt;Will this be the end of Google News? Only if Google News chooses to do this. Google News will no longer be able to copy parts of the article outside, so the reader doesn't have to read the articles anymore.

Or if anyone else does it.. This is a problem for news aggregation sites generally, not just google news, in fact it probably isn't a problem for google news as they will work with publishers. It is a problem for say, a plant blog that used to show the headlines and first few lines of plant care articles from other sources.

In short, it takes something that used to be fairly good web etiquette (pulling a short bit of content and linking to the full) and prevents it. 

&gt;In any case, there is no link tax. To say only the owner of the content can republish it, in my opinion, is a no-brainer.

So essentially your argument is that you don't like that it has been termed a 'link tax' (even though it creates a cost to link sensibly to offsite content..) rather than it no-longer being part of this package?",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/b5rdy9/julia_reda_article_13_a_disaster_for_internet/ejgs5u9/,-ah,1553651527

The purpose of government is to work for the society, for the people. Not entertain the wants of a few lobbies who can afford to line the pockets of a few selfish individuals. Furthermore, the very nature of the passing of this article is a joke.

&amp;#x200B;

Society is a set of rules placed on people, where said people agree to these rules. Because they agree to these rules, order can occur. In this case, we have not agreed to these rules. These rules are not agreed by society. Only by a few purchased/bought individuals and people so detached with the situation they had no idea what they even voted for.

&amp;#x200B;

It is not fair, nor acceptable to expect everyone in a society as large as the EU to follow such a set of rules (article 13) which the wide populace does not agree to. It is not fair, nor acceptable to enforce such a legislation which was put in place by not only clearly corrupt and incompetent individuals, but also flat-out misinformed people. Some of the people in congress who voted for article 13 even apparently did so by mistake - which outlines the situation of what is either corruption, bribe, misinformation or incompetence.

3826,"&gt; Well it seems Belgian MEPs actually answer and actually answer with arguments. Something not many coutries are blessed with. 

I forgot to add, I am still waiting for an answer from Ivo Belet's office, the final MEP I contacted. :)

&gt; The directive in the version of those you quote sounds good, but with the imprecise wording and the things some German and French politicians say it does not seem the actual laws will look like that, at least in their respective countries.

The version I quoted was from September! Article 13 has since then been rewritten completely from scratch! Please don't base your current opinion on it, I was merely illustrating why I changed my mind, and how others did not.

&gt; But I’m nit sure this law will actually help Europeans and not give power to the American companies. Sometimes laws backfire. 

Yes, sometimes laws backfire, but it doesn't appear that this one has that potential. Also do not forget that there are 32 articles, and even the most radical opponents only oppose 3. 

Article 5 for instance includes more exceptions for educational uses, especially for digital and cross-border cases. 60% of educators say they do not use digitally copyrighted works in their lessons, because they are afraid of legal repercussions. 25% of educators say they are stopped from using digital content in their lessons at least once a week. 

This is especially relevant in a time where services like Brilliant are emerging, which are cross-border, and digital. They were not able to use the same copyright exceptions as regular, offline, national education. 

&gt; So sure, the EU could rip it apart, but that would basically mean them pulling out and that would hurt the typical Eurooean and the small European company (ans the economy) a lot. 

If they pull out they lose one of their largest markets. Their shareholders will not allow that. Their stock would tank massively. Their competitors would still have access to the European market, and easily outcompete them.

&gt; using “evidence” ranging from “my uncles shop...” to “research” done by obscure bodies as proof, while dismissing legit, even government owned bodies prood against it as “corporste propaganda”. 

In the EU legislation is made by the Commission which is an apolitical institution. It does not concern itself with public opinion (but it does care about arguments from the public, as made evident by the fact any citizen can get involved with the drafting of any legislation), only with research and effectiveness. It published multiple studies on the subject, as it does with all laws, totalling thousands and thousands of pages. 

&gt; the same may happen with YouTube vs the European artist/consumer with this directive if it is implemented into law the wrong way (the Voss and French politician way).

There are many evil ways to implement this law. But there are many evil ways to implement the existing laws too. It's a directive, it is meant to give as much freedom to the member states as possible.

Currently there is no guaranteed right to parody in Europe. We completely rely on the benevolence of our national governments to implement that right.

And you know what? Most countries implemented this exception. Sure, some did not. But should we really prohibit the majority of member states from making laws to enforce copyright online, just because some member states might not do this in a way we like? Surely that cannot be the case, and that's also not what we did in the past.

Sure, some countries like the UK and Ireland might even not allow you to make digital copies of works you own for personal use. But why should the UK and Ireland being especially restrictive prevent other countries from adding an exception to parody?! (Directive 2001/29/EC)

Or to apply the same line of thought to the current law. Why should some countries not be allowed to ensure a fair pay for their small content providers, just because Germany might try to be especially restrictive with that? If Germany wants to abuse this law, let them do so. The companies will just flee to the EU country with the best climate for them to do business in. 

&gt; But I do see potential bad and even ironic effects and until this directive is implemented by the most radically for it EU countries and the implementation proves otherwise, I will see this as a misguided step in the wrong direction.

I somewhat agree. Article 17 is not something that will excite anyone, and it definitely can be interpreted in a bad way should a member state feel like they want to be especially malicious. 

However, I also recognise that a few member states being malicious shouldn't prevent other member states from genuinely improving their laws. And I also see that the law that was approved wasn't ""Article 17"". It was the ""Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market"", a law with 32 articles, a lot of which _are_ articles to get really excited about, like Article 5 which I mentioned previously. 

Thanks for having an honest and open conversation by the way! Sometimes on Reddit it feels like we're talking to robots. Even though we might not agree, I can certainly respect your stance on the issue!

I will summarize it for you: In the Scandinavians you have the most egalitarian societies. People are as free as they can be in the modern day to pursue whatever career they want. Still 90% of nurses are women and 90% engineers are men. Compare that to a country with very low egalitarian policies. Like Bulgaria. 50% of scientists are women. 50% of 'bosses' are women. So while you lower the socio economical factors and the BIOLOGICAL factors maximize - they CONFIRM the traditional gender sterotypes are based on nature not in society. In fact society and culture are so profoundly based on what nature bestowed upon its, that is laughable how modern day sociologists can argue that we are 99% socium. Women tend to go for 'male dominated' fields in poorer countries because they want to earn a livable wage. While in the Scandinavians they are free to go after whatever the ywant. And it just so happens that women ON AVERAGE are more interested in people, while men ON AVERAGE are more interested in thigns. Doesnt mean one will not follow the other.

It only means that in order to eradicate this biological trait you have to introduce tyranny. All of the 'gender quotas' in certain fields need to be abolished because 50/50 equal spread will never be accomplished without terrorizing and bending peoples natural proclivities and desires.",,/r/europe/comments/b5nhn3/danish_girls_are_more_likely_to_lose_interest_in/ejg8cnz/,jjBregsit,1553637015

3922,"&gt; Still, who would decide which is better and what does accessible mean?

It's a directive. Member states decide. 

&gt; YouTube already pays creators as most music videos or on Vevo channels of their respective companies (and this directive lobbyists), also most TV and movie stuff is official. 

The issue is that those payments are not fair. Content creators have to accept whatever breadcrumbs YouTube pays to them, since YouTube could just choose not to pay anything at all. It's not like the rightholders right now can just walk away from the negotiating table, since they can't take their content off of YouTube. 

Despite services like YouTube being the preferred way for consumers to access creative works, services like YouTube represent only 4% of revenue for those works. That's a _huge_ value gap, and the gap is even larger for smaller creators. 

Article 17 is meant to force platforms like YouTube in conducting more fair licensing agreements. 

&gt; Also we have the fundamentals, you don't make a law of which a small group lobbying for it is in favor and the vast majority of normal people are not. Not in a democracy. 

In a representative democracy, representatives study and vote on legislation. They do this as their full time jobs.

I think it's quite arrogant for people to make ridiculous claims like ""it'll make platforms liable for any infringement!"". 

Nonetheless, the representatives have heard the concerns, taken them into consideration, and where the concerns were valid, amended the law accordingly. The process took over two years and it has finally come to an end. Yes, there is still fierce opposition, but usually this is not based on solid argumentation. There are still strong arguments against Article 17, but they usually do not outweigh the benefits, both of Article 17 and the other 32 articles in the legislation.

3930,"&gt; Second that ""companies won't bother to take the risk and just block everything"" which is like saying that YouTube won't allow any more videos because videos will be copyrighted from now on. Not true, and even if it was, it would allow other companies to fill in that space

YouTube blocking EU users is certainly an *option*.

If the potential liability from being sued by copyright holders due to material getting through the blocks is greater than the amount of money that YouTube makes from the EU, then it only makes business sense.

Videos are already copyrighted.  The only reason YouTube can show you user videos *at all* is 1. because the liability for copyright infringement is currently the responsibility of the users uploading content and 2. because the copyright enforcement regime is notice-and-take-down, meaning they are not liable as long as they take down videos promptly.

Article 13/17 changes all that.

If YouTube does pull out, any competitor will have to comply with exactly the same law that killed Google's business.  And they won't have a hundred million's worth of R&amp;D and a decade's worth of experience in automatic identification of copyrighted material in order to help them comply.

&gt; Third that it will impact websites, again ignoring that the directive explicitly exempts small websites and asks for the effort done be proportionate to the company/website size.

It does not exempt small websites that are older than three years.  The small business exceptions are very weak.

&gt; If you are a small content creator, your rights will actually be greatly increased, as you will be given a state run office the will mediate between you and hosting website, which will be before courts. For example, if YouTube removes your content you will be able to go to this entity for appeal (the real reason why YouTube and Google are fighting hard to stop this)

This will not help you if Google decide that complying is more trouble than it's worth.  In that case there won't be a YouTube to distribute videos on - the EU cannot force a private company to provide a service.

Even if YouTube doesn't restrict EU services, since the penalties for taking content down are so much weaker than the potential liability should infringing content get through, it is almost inevitable that the filters will be made more stringent in order to minimise YouTube's risk of being the target of litigation.

Either way, it will be harder and take longer for you to post your own original content online.

As far as I can tell, the real goal of this directive is to set up a compulsory licensing regime whereby rights management organisations like GEMA can take a bigger cut of Google's ad revenue.  It does this by stacking the deck entirely in favour of copyright holders - websites will have almost no grounds to refuse a license from a copyright holder, as they cannot control what content their users will upload, and prompt takedown is explicitly no longer enough (otherwise the existing regime would be sufficient).

The only alternative is to implement 'best practise' to prevent upload.  But it is literally impossible to prevent upload without reviewing the content, whether manually or with a filtering algorithm.

This law completely reverses the legal basis upon which the Internet has operated successfully for almost its entire lifetime.  It's a bad law passed to increase the income streams of traditional publishers whose business model has failed to adapt.  It risks the open platforms and free communication which have allowed modern independent creators to build an audience for themselves.

Some people are certainly misinformed.  But there are a lot of people who have read and understand the Directive who are horrified that it has passed.",,/r/europe/comments/b5ox1r/article_13_has_just_been_approved/ejg8gsv/,edmundmk,1553637094

&amp;#x200B;

Now as I see it these two paragraphs directly contradict each other. So ambiguity remains. You can´t both follow 17(4) and 17(7). Of course 17(7) only really means that the laws the member states make cannot literally require businesses to implement upload filters directly. This is also in direct conflict with 17(8) in regards to general monitoring. But what you have to realize is that all this means is that the law cannot literally say ""corporations are required to have general monitoring which can be totally indiscriminate"". But Axel Voss has made it pretty clear that this does not mean that if article 17 leads to such monitoring corporations would be fined or anything like that. This is basically just empty talk which is actually a major point of the criticism in Germany. The only reason this is in here is because the CDU and SPD wrote in their coalition contract that there shall be no general filters. But in reality there is no alternative.

You have practically no interest in shaming the harming of innocents, unless you believe yourself to be the victim.

You think that admitting you were wrong on anything is damaging to your tribe while not doing so due to a childish rivalry is actually more harmful to your collective psyche.

Perhaps I am, cause I'm a realistic, and that's how shit sadly works. Being the moral side won't get us anything at all. 

&gt;More childish sentiment that assumes rivalries and vengeful behavior is eternal. The same mentality behind the justification of blood feuds.

4055,"&gt; what i am reading is that the law is about removing (or at least minimising) false negatives. otherwise, you as a service provider, can circumvent this directive by implementing a useless filter that returns 100% false negatives.

Platforms have to do a best effort to remove duplicates of previously reported illegitimate content. What is a best effort is constrained in multiple ways. The most relevant ones are:

1. Article 17(5) says that member states, in determining what is a best effort, should take special attention to the cost and availability of said effort, especially relative to the size of the service. For instance, a expensive system detecting JPEG encoding artefacts is likely too expensive for small image boards, but it will be perfectly feasible for Instagram.
2. Article 17(7) says that any best effort shall not result in legitimate content being taken offline.

So to then say that copyright filters will lead to unfair takedowns is contrary to what the law says. Sure, there will be a lot of false negatives. But that's fine. If there is no way to reduce the amount of false negatives without taking offline legitimate content, then the current approach is sufficient.

What they entered into was supposed to be a trade union that has grown out of control and how the process works to change things is broken due to the inability of members to put forth legislation which is done several times removed from the countries. On top of that the fact that they couldnt even guarantee that they wouldnt put forth a change to prevent one from leaving in the future. It stops the UK from being able to deny entry to people that can and are dangerous in some cases until they have done something within the country. There currently are areas that Muslims force Islam on people living in them and law enforcement has largely turned a blind eye due to how it would be made out by the media. We have people getting attacked by immigrants for walking with their partner because they happen to be gay, women assaulted for walking around alone, etc. This is all due to the fact that they have little desire to assimilate and instead live together in such large numbers that they basically control entire communities and while Muslims in general are not a problem Turkish Muslims tend to be far less tolerant than most. Those that got allowed into the EU disproportionately left for England. There are a bunch of other

4246,"The members of the European Parliament voted on an amended directive that deals with online copyrights. One of the iffier parts was that a website  could be held liable for copyrighted information it hosts. Under the proposed measure if, for  example, if you made a song and someone on YouTube plagiarized it,  you could sue YouTube. As  a result, YouTube and everyone  else would have to really up the security of what counts as copyrighted  stuff, not host anything suspicious or not show it in the EU.

The measure passed in the European Parliament. Now it needs to get the go-ahead of the national governments in the Council. I think it will do so, since they already had negotiations between the parliament and the governments before that which produced the current compromise text.

If they give their assent (they are using qualified majority rules), they have 2 years to make national laws based on this directive. EU directives are not laws in themselves, they are basically guidelines   the member states pledge to implement in law. Since they are making  the laws and they get some leeway on how they interpret the directive, we don't know *exactly* what will be in them. They are the laws that matter, though, because they are the ones people get sued under. 

If  they don't give it, hmm, as far as I can tell the whole thing goes back to negotiations again and the parliament and the national government representatives have to agree on a text again or they give up and the current way of copyright dispute resolution continues.",,/r/europe/comments/b5ox1r/article_13_has_just_been_approved/ejfaqq8/,4uk4ata,1553615477

4255,"&gt;Me neither. As societies become more prosperous and gender egalitarian, the gender disparity in STEM increases. There's nothing wrong with that.

It increases because of the long maternity leaves, other societal reasons and the sexism that makes it difficult for women, so it's easier to just go elsewhere. 

&gt;A lack of female role models in Psychology/Medicine/Law/Marketing/Journalism didn't stop women from entering those fields en masse.

Yes, because they are more acceptable, people professions where they can still get money. The irony is that because they became female fields the wages plummeted. 

&gt;There are many fields that used to be 99% male in the past and are now majority female.

Exactly, they change because they are cultural, not biological issues. 

&gt;And I don't know what your job experience is, but a lot of those fields are more sexist than any STEM field I've ever seen.

We already had this argument so I guess now we're just going in circles. To end I'd say that you can't let perfect be the enemy of good. You'll never find your perfect measurement that accounts for everything.

Furthermore, pushing in a direction that produces results opposite to what you want and blaming it on poor measurements after the results are in is bad science. You have an hypothesis before the experiments are done (more egalitarian society = less difference between men and women) and you agree on certain ways to measure things. If after the experiments are done the data contradicts your hypothesis it means it was wrong. You can just try again with a new measurement method, of course, but like I said, the things you're mentioning are very hard and likely impossible to measure in any scientific sound way.",,/r/europe/comments/b5nhn3/danish_girls_are_more_likely_to_lose_interest_in/ejfawkx/,adnzzzzZ,1553615582

""EU member states now have two years to pass their own laws that put the Copyright Directive into effect.

In a statement, YouTube said the final version of the directive was “an improvement” but that it remained “concerned” that Article 13 could have “unintended consequences that may harm Europe’s creative and digital economy”.""

So basically the final version of Article 13 was an improvement but still potentially subject to issues, but nothing so rife for abuse that it's literally THE END. Also that EU member states can implement it in the way they see fit. I'm gonna just out on a limb and say the majority of people aren't gonna notice it including almost everyone here. 

One thing I've changed my opinion on, is growing up with Dial up since the 90's, I've always maintained the internet was different and the internet was free, with whatever BS happened in real life the internet was different, different rules, different philosophies. Honestly I no longer believe that, if there's anything the last 10 years have taught me is that the internet is an extension of real life now, not separate and now must be subject to the same rules as real life. Youtube/Google, Facebook, News Orgs, Reddit, twitter and more have taught me, the lines have blurred and there are too many ""normal"" people that haven't subscribed to any sort of ""meta"" or established rules, these persons perception of what they think of ""the internet"" to begin with is massively skewed. The internet is now rife abuse: Death threats and consequences have changed, misinformation campaigns have exploded, users have become extremely prone to mob mentalities, safe spaces and confirmation bias have become a thing, ideals have changed, how copyright sharing has already been tightened and changed, most people only consider the internet to even be just a few websites, most people here probably aren't even going on places that super exist outside of hosted media. 

I can't remember the last time I went to a website that really existed outside of the spectrum of the giants webspace, like a Z-THING or some dudes crappy 90's HTML awful website with 20 gif's of the same thing on loop. The game's changed and I think the more people recognize that the more we can help it shape something constructive out it where disinformation thrives, there has to be standards now. 

I know this will be unpopular but most 99% of people hearing about article 13 passing will not even read the article, in the next 2 years they will probably think it's already been implemented, kind of the in same way a lot of voters thought Brexit was already implemented just by virtue of having passed.

It will of course depend a 100 % on how the rules are implemented and whether companies are able to find loopholes etc. I haven't been following the subject that much, so I might be mistaken and the press announcement is of course going to make it sound more positive than it is. That being said, I think this paragraph seems positive: 

&gt; Currently, internet companies have little incentive to sign fair licensing agreements with rights holders, because they are not considered liable for the content that their users upload. They are only obliged to remove infringing content when a rights holder asks them to do so. However, this is cumbersome for rights holders and does not guarantee them a fair revenue. Making internet companies liable will enhance rights holders’ chances (notably musicians, performers and script authors, as well as news publishers and journalists) to secure fair licensing agreements, thereby obtaining fairer remuneration for the use of their works exploited digitally.

 So, when Tito died, it was clear there will be war at some point ( at least to some people). When Yugoslavia finally broke they attempted to grab areas where serbs are very present and make that into Great Serbia and they thought they can because they controlled JNA (Yugoslavia army). The problem was that not all those areas had clear historical slate and have much mixed history with i.e Croats. Now, if they attempted to negotiate in many of these cases they would probably now have Kosovo and Republika Srpska and much better position for their minorities in neighbouring countries. But, they were greedy and as always, oblivious to political realities so they lost almost everything. Much of this I blame on Milosevic regime but again.. the guy couldn't have done it alone. 
Oh yeah, maybe they shouldn't have done things like Vukovar, Srebrenica and bombing of Dubrovnik which got them bombed by Nato the first time in Bosnia. I can understand ambition, but I will never understand serbian abusive relationship with reality.

4536,"&gt; It levels the playing field.

You and Axel Voss are equally clueless about this. Upload filters as article 17 requires DO NOT EXIST. If anybody managed to create one, it would be an advancement in machine learning of immense proportions. This kind of filtering requires human-level intellect, something that is at least decades away.

Hell, even *humans themselves* have a hard time sifting through the *millions* of complicated copyright claims. For example, someone films a public protest, some guy drives by, playing some song by Rihanna, and loudly plays a song by Rihanna. You can be that filters will erroneously think that this video contains copyrighted content, and will filter it out.

This article 17 is *unenforceable*, since it relies on sci-fi technology.

So, what will happen is that we'll get faulty filters. Since developing even these is an incredibly difficult and expensive process, and also requires samples from *every copyrighted work on the planet* (otherwise the filter cannot recognize copyrighted stuff), they will be developed by a few tech giants with deep enough pockets. These filters will ... mostly ... work, and will flag perfectly legal stuff as well, exactly as we see it today already with content ID. European companies will have no choice but to license these filters from US giants.

4540,"&gt; It is not consumption valleys or peaks that matter. These are pretty predictable. What matters is the amount renewables can cover at their worst point not that they can do 66% or more when they work very well. 

If renewables can supply 100% of demand 90% of the time at a cheap price, then that means there's room in the budget for even expensive storage without raising the average price of energy too much.

&gt;As for storage we simply lack the technology or the geography for the technology we know 

At some point we'll have to tackle a renewable supply of heating fuel anyway. So if we have the infrastructure to convert excess electricity to methane or another chemical storage format, that can serve both as electricity storage, and a way to have a renewable heating supply.

Brexiteers want out of the EU because they don't feel feted enough by Brussles, they resent the strong ties between France and Germany because deep down they feel they are being marginalised, that it should be them. They resent the concessions they have to make with the EU because the want that it were the reverse, that the EU dance to Wesminster's tune. Immigration, along with the demonisation of the poor and the vulnerable, has become a way of masking discontent with the relentless austerity policies, of Universal Credit, zero hour contracts, wages that haven't risen since the 70s.

Independence: we want out of the UK because fundamentally the Union binds our sovereignty, our electorate will always be trumped by England, this in one measure or another has been an issue for almost the entire history of the Union. 
We don't like what they UK has become and is becoming. Hollyrood expends considerable energy on softening the blow of austerity policies on our health service, services for the disabled and the vulnerable of our society through on financial strings we don't control. We disagree on immigration - our economy needs the free movement of people. We see Brexit as economic suicide. We see the party within a party that drives Brexit and wants closer ties with Trump's isolationist US directly with our exports like whisky and salmon being used as bargaining chips.

4650,"&gt; Please, we both know that's what you've been referring to when you speak of ""eroding a people's sovereignty"".

Absolutely not. You deny the right of others' to extrapolate but you're a master at the practice. The so-called ""debt trap"" is another issue altogether.

Outright selling the ownership, or ceding the long-term exploitation of a strategic asset to a corporation owned by a foreign government is a net loss of sovereignty in my book.

&gt; Don't try to deny it.

Well ok then, so much for ""intelligent debate"". If I were to use the same argument as Trump, that'd be Trump argument, and my argument, but only one would serve as reference. Read into that whatever you want.

&gt; But that doesn't mean you should just dismiss anything you believe isn't right and refuse to learn more.

Keyword being *authoritative* source. I learnt a lot over the years and speaking with you would be pointless otherwise.

&gt; No, they're not. I live in HK, I should know.

As you said yourself, it's ""not exactly"" home. Anyway it's hard to quantify, since there's no proper study and no independent polling. No point on dwelling on the topic. The fact is they've invested insane amount in propaganda, both domestic and international, and probably wouldn't go on doing so should they deem it to bring little value.

&gt; China is far more open to foreign companies than even Japan and Korea today.

How would you quantify that?

&gt;  but there's a reason why foreign brands earn so much money in the China market to the point of pandering to them 

The market is much bigger? Japan and Korea populations add up to about 200 millions, that's Shandong and Henan. HK has historically been extremely open and was never pandered to.

&gt; And the persecution of Huawei is just the trendsetter. Given the obvious political motive by the US in trying to shut them out of international markets, we can expect anti-China propaganda to expand towards other Chinese brands as they reach Huawei's level.

We'll see. I can't agree with your assessment but only the future can tell.

&gt; The fact that it should encourage the US and EU cores to compete with Chinese influence by investing time and money of their own into Italy as well. 

That's not a game anyone should play if they aren't ready to fall 100% into one's ""sphere of influence"". Like courting guy X in the hope that guy Y gets jealous and come back with more, and so on and so forth.

&gt; Don't you think it's more condescending if I insulted your intelligence by lying to you otherwise, like claiming I'm ""worried"" for your own good?

4666,"&gt; Maybe you shouldn't categorise a whole nation?

The stereotypes form for a reason. I'm Polish and the stereotype about lots of Poles being thieves is sadly true. There are a lot of such scum as burglars, robbers and thieves in this country and the justice system is extremely lenient towards them. 

My friend got his apartment burglarized, had the faces of the subhuman scam on film and the police did not allow him to publish that. After 2 months he got a letter that the case was closed because they couldn't locate the perpetrators. If he were to publish the video on his own he would face jail time and be liable to pay a restitution to the burglars for hurting their public image. They didn't steal much as he fortunately took his laptop with his on that day, so he just gave up. 

Pretty much everyone I know has been robbed or has had their stuff stolen at some point. 

Recently there was a famous case where [a shop owner noticed a thief and closed the door until the police arrived](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=pl&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwiadomosci.gazeta.pl%2Fwiadomosci%2F7%2C114883%2C24435651%2Cpoznan-sad-skazal-sklepikarza-za-uwiezienie-zlodzieja-nie.html). The thief said that the shop owner has chained him to a window grill to the prosecutor and not only was he not charged, the shop owner was sentenced to 10 months suspended for 2 years and forced to pay the thief 1000 zł. The only evidence were the claims of the thief and there was no window grill in the room where the thief claims to have been kept.

I mean, from the purely demographics perspective, Russia's (or Eastern Europe's, for that matter) future looks kinda bleak in comparison.

4864,"&gt; such as the ""China debt trap"" propaganda

I never once mentioned the China dept trap, you did. So you make a statement, generalise it then use it to argue against my point? That's hardly fair now, is it?

&gt; And you don't need to be a particularly bad kind of person to think of ""others"" as unpersons, that's just how humans are naturally wired.

Quite true indeed. In our case though, that's another assumption you made based on your own biases, that somehow ""western"" folks would look down upon PRC subjects for being incapable of forming their own opinion. Yet the general media profile is vastly different in ""the west"", that the coverage of event swings wildly between the US TV channels you're maybe more accustomed to reading about on the internet and smaller-diffusion papers in North America or Europe (I admittedly don't know much about Oceania). I don't really want to harp on that topic but it again feels like a bruised ego that tries to fight off every perceived aggression even when there genuinely are none.

&gt; My argument is my own. I take offence at your claim it's not.

I didn't try to claim it isn't and may have misworded my thoughts. While you're entitled to your opinions, I can't judge the actions of X or Y entity based on what someone else thinks of them, but rather based on what X or Y themselves say about it. If I find myself distrusting that entity or its representatives for whatever reason I'd be looking at the analysis of people well-versed in the field, with a verifiable background, and eventually cross-reference X or Y statements with those experts assessments. I might still be wrong in the end but no reddit user should ever be used as an authoritative source.

&gt; Not really. Have you even read the PRC discuss at length Alexander Hamilton's infant industries argument? 

No, indeed. It seems to me that their public stance has always been a ""we're developing, we have special circumstances, some protections are thus warranted"" but I struggle to find actual statements from officials, save for empty words like opposite my recollection, like ""[All countries should remove trade protectionism of all forms, and mutually open market](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t24962.shtml)"" by Jiang Zemin, then Chairman. 

&gt; The Chinese government absolutely SUCK at propaganda.

*abroad. They're masters at home. Tied in with real, palpable and impressive wealth gains for a lot of its citizens, it does wonders for its popularity. I'd wager the few who dared dissent in public recently, and who were quickly and quietly suppressed, have meager support.

&gt; Protectionism was behind the rise of strong domestic brands who moved on to becoming international champions, a fact echoed again and again by East Asian economies like Japan and Korea following the US's protection of its infant industries. 

For sure. Protectionism is vilified by those who can abuse free-trade and heralded by those who can't. Tables turn quickly depending on the market. Only a fool who deny that the PRC expertfully puppeteered avid companies in investing at home, exchanging huge capital gains for IP, when the end goal always was to grow its own industry which would eventually take over. The success story is currently most visible in the consumer electronic market, but I believe transportation will soon follow (lead by rail) and it's just a beginning.

Though that was hardly the point of the conversation. I was saying that it may be legitimate to restrict trade with a partner that won't allow you to take over their industry like you allow them to take over yours. That's where I have to bounce back on your Huawei argument: sure, the US stance on Huawei might be partly politically motivated, it doesn't mean it's preventing all Chinese companies from succeeding. The low-end to mid-end smartphone market, for instance, is trusted by Chinese brands (not just suppliers but wholly operated and controlled operations). The car market's time might come when Chinese cars get competitive, just like it happened with Japanese then Koreans.

&gt; All I'm arguing is to treat China like competition for US influence. 

I'm not sure what you're trying to say here. What's US influence on Italy, and how would it benefit the country to receive more Chinese influence? Italy already imports a great deal more from the PRC than from the USA, wouldn't it make the Chinese influence already greater?

&gt; That's how thing should be, instead of listening to silly US propaganda which only aims to reserve Italy (and other countries) for US influence only.

Sounds like you're talking about Italy as a cake you want the PRC to have a piece of. Kind of condescending tbh.

&gt; In that regard, China cannot and should not help you there.

That's convenient. Yet perfectly true, practically speaking. We're out of an economic discussion here though, and onto a moral/political one: should one take advantage of others, because they don't know what's good for them? I don't know, but the fact is countries by and large always do. One strength of the PRC has always been its professed ""economics with politic"" stance, a facade that served it well. So I guess you'd agree with me, should those trade deals be unbalanced, it would eventually be Italy's fault for agreeing to them in the first place.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/b39r8j/xi_says_china_ready_to_take_ties_with_italy_into/ejeae1b/,dalyscallister,1553575930

4905,"&gt; Keep in mind there's no way the US would be convicted of even a single war crime by the international court.

This is true, and the US has a troubled history with punishing its own for bad decision making in war and even deliberately killing civilians without military necessity. Killing civilians is by itself not entirely wrong according to the most broadly accepted agreements on the rules of war but it has to have some kind of necessity to justify it.  ""Necessity"" being defined as necessary to achieve a certain objective, that's vague as all hell of course and the politics between states that influence ICC cases (and who even goes before the Judges) makes it even worse but that's nonetheless the only definition thats broadly accepted. 

In practice is means you aren't supposed to deliberately target civilians but if some die while you're targeting or intending to target something else is not a war crime.  The US has a bad reputation of even meeting that standard in many cases, for example the Grdelica  training bombing or the My Lai Massacre in Vietnam.  There are some examples of the US doing the right thing like the case of Robert Bales who massacred several civilians in Afghanistan but the cases of doing the right thing are too few in my opinion.

I can't deny the US should do better in enforcing the rules of engagement and holding itself accountable for the incidences when they are violated.  

&gt;To explain what I meant. We're pretty defiant my nature. Military losses alone were never gonna make us surrender, and they weren't even that great, NATO destroyed mostly decoys. Overall I'd say their military performance was very poor considering they fought a failed state. All their KLA ground offensives failed too. Destroying our infrastructure though, occasionally killing civilians, making them fear for their life, that could and in the end did.

I'd say the military performance was overall very effective since the objectives of the military action were achieved in short order.  

I agree with you though that attacking infrastructure is what ultimately ended the conflict. Though I still disagree that was deliberate targeting civilians as a manner of military strategy though the pilot of that aircraft attacking the bridge may have deliberately targeted civilians personally I think he did so without explicit orders.

I hope this doesn't sound too offensive what I'm about to say but I hope you can at least understand the dilemma of choice that was faced and that I talked about earlier.  American assessments agree with you that just targeting the military was proving ineffective at achieving the goals of bringing Serbia to the peace table and compelling them to agree to an occupation of Kosovo by UN peacekeepers.  It wasn't only that Serbians were willing to endure military loses its that the Serbia Army was so spread out and so good at concealment we couldn't make effective strikes.

The decision was then ""If targeting the military isn't sufficient, what else can we target or should we just go home?"" The answer was to target infrastructure, bridges, Novi Sad's water treatment and supply facilities, and similar targets that couldn't be hidden.  That decision necessitated accepting the loss of civilians, though I still deny that any deliberate targeting of civilians was done as a manner of strategy, which was a cost we were willing to have Serbians pay.  That's cruel but I hope you can understand in the context of how Serbian forces also faced similar decisions and choose to accept the fact that civilians would suffer, excluding the instances where civilians were deliberately targeted.  Its a sad fact of war that in order to bring the level of force necessary to make your enemy surrender and accept your terms that civilians will inevitably die. 

Lastly, I've denied twice that civilians were deliberately targeted but I understand that killing civilians can in some circumstances push an enemy to surrender.  At times it just emboldens them, but sometimes it makes them lose the will to fight. If you feel that was the case in Serbia I can't really argue against you and I can understand how'd you feel that civilians were deliberately targeted if it fits into your understanding of how the Americans achieved victory in the end.  

Personally as an American I try not to be biased towards my own country even though I inevitably am but I still feel from all I've read that there was no policy of deliberately targeting civilians but a policy of accepting some civilians would die as a result of expanding the air campaign to target infrastructure and civilian infrastructure.  That's a very fine line but I feel like its an important one since in the 1990s and even today it would be impossible wage a military campaign of that scale without somewhere killing a civilian so that line represents the difference between inadvertent civilian causalities and deliberate massacres ",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/b57vhj/yesterday_marked_the_20th_anniversary_of_the/ejdxwxg/,MeatsimN64,1553565156

Its actually perhaps a hundred times more complicated than Brexit itself is, and probably far more damaging.

&gt; The Scottish economy is rich and relatively diversified, with 2014 per capita GDP estimated to be US$47,369 (based on the Scottish government's estimates, which include Scotland's geographic share of North Sea output, abbreviated asScotland (Geographical) in the table above). Scottish wealth levels are comparable to that of the U.K. ('AAA'), Germany('AAA'), Ireland ('BBB+'), and New Zealand ('AA-'). Even excluding North Sea output and calculating per capita GDPonly by looking at onshore income, Scotland would qualify for our highest economic assessment. Higher GDP percapita, in our view, gives a country a broader potential tax and funding base to draw from, which supports credit worthiness.

no they didnt. War in Baltics went on for good 10 years after WW2 ended, NKDV were fighting partisans well into 1950's.

5196,"&gt; Which basic individual rights do you have that a German or a French citizen doesn’t have? The right to be under surveillance 24/7 in the democracy with the most complete CCTV mass surveillance?

You haven't read the case of Andrew Symeou? That was in my first post. 

&gt;Speaking of democracy and and liberty and such—While we’re digging out old timey glorious achievement—you don’t hear much praise for these liberties from citizens of former British colonies. Why would that be?

I have no idea where you're going with this but i can think of a former British colony which certainly is full of praise of liberty and democracy, it's called the USA. If you were a little bit familiar with history you would know that they built their political system on the rights of the English by that point and took it even further. 

&gt;Which individual rights do you see threatened by EU policies? I mean, name a few. 

I literally quoted an example in my very first post which you haven't even bothered to look at, lol. 

&gt;And why do you imply that individual rights don’t matter in the rest of EU democracies? Vague “good old times” from centuries ago are quite irrelevant today. Invocations of former glory are rather ridiculous.

Because these EU states have only just begun on the way to individual rights and liberties. You are fledgling democracies in comparison to the UK. You could easily fall back into the bloodthirsty hands of tyrants, why on Earth should we trust you? 

Remember, the English pioneered these rights. The Germans are emulating the Anglo-American tradition because their own politics led them to disaster.

5200,"Actually, a counterthreat is highly unlikely. As a winner you don't want to rule over nuclear ashes, you want to gain something out of it because otherwise you've wasted people and resources for basically zip.

Thing is, as the winner it'd be a stupid move - sure, if you threaten back you might look mighty, but a government which has nukes and is on the verge of losing and becoming occupied territory or vassaled, generally will count on the opposing side taking into account that any nuke-throwing match will result in severe destruction for the winning side, which the population of the winning side would revolt over after the nuclear dust has settled down.

I'm pretty sure albanians, especially back then, when the Kanun was our sacred book, which forced albanians to act fairly and honorably with everyone, such things happened. Yes perhaps isolated cases, but certainly not comparable to what the slavic rule did throughout the century to us. The riots, do you have any idea why they happened? Certainly not. It was students who started it, because they wanted better conditions and to end the brutality of the regime, to release the political prisoners, then the violence you used in those riots aggravated the situation and angered the population, which led to more riots, more imprisonment, more violence , killings  and the worst part is that you poisoned students during those next 10 years, there were even talks of sterilizing the females to reduce albanian population.  We didn't start anything, we wanted independence just like you, and the creation of an albanian national state which included all albanian-populated territories in it, we didn't get that instead we got cut in half and that's when you started the genocide since 1912.

**NO**

* The risks of becoming independent looked too great when it came to things like the currency, EU membership, the economy, jobs and prices. (**47%**)
* A strong attachment to the United Kingdom and its shared history, culture and traditions. (**27%**)
* A NO vote would still mean extra powers for the Scottish Parliament together with the security of remaining part of the United Kingdom, giving the best of both worlds. (**25%**)

**YES**

* The principle that all decisions about Scotland should be taken in Scotland. (**70%**)
* That on balance Scotland's future looked brighter as an independent country. (**20%**)
* That independence would mean no more Conservative governments. (**10%**)

When asked about the main issues that influenced their decision most NO voters selected ""The Pound"", while most YES voters selected ""Dissatisfaction with Westminster politics"".

5371,"&gt;This NATO response was absolutely about stopping a genocide.

NATO doesn't care about genocide. Look up their demands during the peace talks, or you want to I'll list them here. Those weren't the demands of a side out to get peace and prevent the killings, but of a side out to assert its dominance over the region.

&gt;This was only a NATO action in the first place, because China and Russia vetoed a UN intervention for their own strategic reasoning.

They did so because they knew that NATO had no good intentions and was in it for geopolitics. 

&gt;Look at it from any direction and it becomes clear that the intervention was solely about preventing further bloodshed and ethnic cleansing.

Only if you look through the lense of their propaganda. Look deeper and you'll see the truth.

&gt;Comparing it to Iraq (which was not a NATO operation) or the illegal Russian annexation of Crimea is disingenuous.

Iraq wasn't a NATO op. but it was a US and UK op. who were the ones mainly behind the '99 bombing. And just like in '99 it was an illegal aggression. Russia's also committed an illegal aggression, like NATO did in '99, pretending to have noble intentions when all they cared for was geopolitics. It compares quite well.

&gt;The problem is that in authoritarian Yugoslavia, people knew little about what their forces were actually doing and had no idea about the brewing international pressure because of their government's genocidal actions.

Yes, the media was a propaganda machine but people knew what was coming. It was talked about quite a bit in the run up.

&gt;To this day, many are thus convinced that the bombings were unjustified, sudden and driven by political motives, whereas in reality, this couldn't be further from the truth.

That's the truth whether you like it or not. It was unjustified as it was one sided in a conflict that wasn't. NATO was aiding the KLA long before the bombing, yet the KLA was still losing, which is why they intervened. They don't care about ethnic cleansing. You have this delusion that NATO is some force of good and is moral. They're not. Like all major powers, they're pieces of shit. Though they have to be if they wanna stay on top.

&gt;This region was at the time and is today only strategically important in the sense that armed conflict there is considered dangerous. Otherwise, it's of little value. We are not in pre-WW1 times anymore.

The Balkans has always been stratigically important, especially in the 90s when our leadership refused to drop communism, reform and open up to the West. Which is why they began working against us as early as 1990.

&gt;That said, I'm not claiming that the intervention was perfect. Nothing is and there were innocent civilian victims, which is an unfortunate reality of warfare that can not be ignored.

5459,"&gt;I'd be interested in what real data says on the subject.

I doubt there is any that directly answers the subject. [This ancient Pew Research from 2004](https://news.gallup.com/poll/12043/americans-know-little-about-european-union.aspx) suggests that Americans know very little about the EU, generally are more positive re: EU than their own country, majority view EU as a likely superpower. 

&gt;For example, Disney basically writing US, and thus world, copyright laws. 

Excuse me???? This is just plain uninformed about basic history.  The EU (and its predecessors and member states) are father, mother, origin of all species of bad copyright law. 

People often claim that Disney somehow wrote US copyright law and then this copyright law was exported to the world. Other fucking way around dude; bad copyright law is a disease that originates in Europe and then infects the US. 

Take the infamous Sonny Bono law, derisively referred to as the Mickey Mouse Act. What did the law do? It expanded US copyright periods.... to provide for the same term of protection that existed in Europe under the 1993 Directive on harmonising the term of copyright protection. If the US did not expand its copyright period, US copyright owners would have lost extended copyright period in the EU under the Berne Convention.  As the Senate Report explained: 

&gt;The purpose of the bill is to ensure adequate copyright protection for American works in foreign nations and the continued economic benefits of a healthy surplus balance of trade in the exploitation of copyrighted works. The bill accomplishes these goals by extending the current U.S. copyright term for an additional 21 years. **Such an extension will provide significant trade benefits by substantially harmonizing U.S. copyright law to that of the European Union** while ensuring fair compensation for American creators who deserve to benefit fully from the exploitation of their works

Note that Disney had lobbied since 1990 for copyright extension. It fell on deaf ears until after the EU expanded copyright protections in 1993. And of course, the EU legislation was worse, because it retroactively removed works from the public domain.  Meanwhile, most European countries continue to lack basic protections like a flexible fair use doctrine available in the U.S. 

And now what is the EU up to? Article 15 bullshit! ",,/r/europe/comments/b4xnf2/inside_chinas_playbook_to_pit_eu_countries/ejcgtd1/,valvalya,1553529386

5463,"Never confuse Sardinia with Sardinia-Piedmont Kingdom under House of Savoy. Piedmont always considered Sardinia as a colonial land from which steal the richness, a big part of the sardinian woods were cutted cause Savoia wanted to build railways in Piedmont; a giant quantity of iron, silver, gold, lead, copper, coal got stolen from sardinian soil in order to make House of Savoy even richer. What made the Savoy as Kings it's the title of Sardinia (which is a kingship), before the illegitimate inheriting of the island they were just small DUKES of the FARMS. Piedmont imposed a regime of terror, oppressing the sardinian population in all the ways (super-heavy taxes, laws against sardinian liberty, enclosures which destroyed sardinian economy). The memory of these evil times still resist today, ""sa giustitzia"" (the piedmontese justice) is still considered a really bad thing and it's used in the spoken language as a bad curse.

5466,"&gt; still thing there's a fair bit of moralism involved as well. The American political.mindsetnis interesting, and whether they just ended up buying their own propaganda I don't know, but politicians and military leaders often actually believe they are doing the right thing and defending the free world. As a result of this mentality, defending democracy and the like even shows up in classified texts. 

Not so sure about that being the case in Kosovo. The higher ups definitely knew what they were doing.

&gt;When it comes to intervention pushed by America, I would say they're still definitely more interested in geopolitics, but they also need to convince their allies to make it a NATO thing. The thing is, not all of NATO necessarily has practical interests in the same interventions, and these have to be justified to them. Granted, many will go along out of a perceived obligation, it is after all an alliance, but moral or ideological justifications are needed as well, and I'm sure some of the national leaders are swayed by that aspect of it.

Some yes, but the British and Germans definitely weren't. Doubt the French were either. The Italians didn't gain too much I believe but I doubt they cared about the dead either, probably just following their allies.

&gt;But that's just my point of view on it. I'm not pretending the ""free world"" is made up of saints, it's not, but it's not evil or at least all self serving either. I absolutely understand your cynicism. Really, once you understand geopolitics on some basic level I suppose you can't help but be a little cynical.

This system works well in Australia.

Once again, the people who support this system are not automatically racist. They too can believe everyone is equal. Not wanting to just allow everyone in but instead wanting to have a say in things by only allowing those with perspecive (along with true refugees fleeing war, of course) into your country is by no means racist or against equality but instead is only focussed on the sustainability of national healthcare, judicial, educational and benefit systems, as well as containing cultural considerations.

Yes thats a very important distinction. 

&gt;But why does someone always have to bring them up when someone mentions our victims?

Because a lot of people are under the impression that Serbia and Serbian forces (meaning both the military of Serbia and paramilitaries from Serbian political entities like Srpska and independently formed units) view themselves as the primary victims in the Yugoslav Wars and feel like they have to correct the record.

For my opinion I think the air campaigns over Bosnia and later Kosovo and Serbia were necessary in order to secure the agreements that led to the end of those conflicts.  Its unfortunate that even despite all the technology and intelligence the American military has, there are still occasions were targets are misidentified or guidance systems fail and I'm deeply sorry for that.

Most of my life I've been advocating for the use of games during education because they do have qualities and transferable skills, but recently I've been forced to tone down, because many people now think games are just as valuable as ""real"" situations.

Point is, games can only cover a very small part of the real life situation, and those aren't even the most valuable skills you get by gaming. Such things as team working are much more valuable.

5562,"&gt;Yes thats a very important distinction. 

Thank you, someone at last.

&gt;Because a lot of people are under the impression that Serbia and Serbian forces (meaning both the military of Serbia and paramilitaries from Serbian political entities like Srpska and independently formed units) view themselves as the primary victims in the Yugoslav Wars and feel like they have to correct the record.

Trust me, we don't have that problem. At least most don't. That's a much bigger problem in the other 3 groups, whose people often have a hard time admitting that they did anything wrong.

&gt;For my opinion I think the air campaigns over Bosnia and later Kosovo and Serbia were necessary in order to secure the agreements that led to the end of those conflicts. Its unfortunate that even despite all the technology and intelligence the American military has, there are still occasions were targets are misidentified or guidance systems fail and I'm deeply sorry for that.

You've clearly not read NATO demands during the Kosovo war peace talks. NATO administration of Kosovo, a military mandate over it, a military base their, full access to all our territory for their troops and even full immunity from all our laws. Do these look like the demands of someone who really wants peace or of an empire looking to assert its dominance over the area and take control?

As for errors, just look up the Grdulica train bombing, where one of your pilots fired off a 2nd missile into a civilian train despite clearly seeing what he had done with the first one.

&gt;Still there's no reason to not have a monument to these children, even though its politicized by everyone considering the context of their deaths they were just children and remembering them can be healthy if that remembrance doesn't come with anger and resentment

5566,"I'm guessing you mean me. But I never meant to say that right vs. left is (completely) obsolete. I'm merely stating that the main point of debate shifted towards ultranationalism vs. pretty much everything else.

Or, in other words, the far-right or whatever you want to call them *is* mainly about ultranationalism (and everything that comes with it, like xenophobia, white supremacy, wanting to close the borders, et cetera).

That's why I personally rather speak of ultranationalism than of far-right. Ultranationalism is what defines them the most, imho.

Democracy is definitely under attack. No doubt. That's been going on for a while. Some EU countries are even close to becoming a hybrid regime or illiberal democracy. That's exactly why I have my doubts about being part of this club. I don't want my country to be part of a Union that allows it.

But I don't fear for my own country. Not yet anyway. We're still a strong, full democracy. And if Baudet becomes the biggest, then he should get the opportunity to form a cabinet. And the rest of us have to swallow it.

But if other parties don't want to cooperate with him, then he and his supporters have to swallow *that*.

I feel like it would tend to show the contrary. Spain was utterly destroyed by its civil war and needed to be rebuilt and repopulated.

The truth is that there isn't a simple explanation like this. Each one of those countries had its own unique story between 1940 and  2018. WW2 is only a part of this story for Poland. Bolchevism is actually a more important factor when it comes to Polish demography. For Turkey, it's because a big part of this country didn't undergo its demographic transition before 1940.

&gt;I want Europe to remain dominantly white and culturally unchanged.

Meaning and further explanation (if you actually bother to look up what else Baudet has to say about this):

The current immigration and integration policies don't allow for smooth integration into society. Anyone can look up the CBS statistics for crime, for instance, from which you could, at the very least, conclude that something is not going the way it should be. 

Dominant, in this context, means that they want a large majority. The very presence of the word ""dominant"" means that those of a different background are welcome. Baudet has further added that those of a different background are welcome as long as they are capable of adapting and adhering to our Western values. As long as people take over the reins and uphold, cherish and further Dutch culture and its values, it shouldn't matter where they're from. If current immigration and integration policies remain the same, and there's a massive influx of immigrants, an even bigger divide between people will form because those people will group with one another rather than mingle with the ""native"" population (like they have been). This will lead to an overall cultural shift (africanization), a hostile environment for a torn people that don't care about each other's culture or values, more actual racism, and more time and resources spent on fixing those things. We already have a problem right now; we should focus on fixing that first.",North Brabant (Netherlands),/r/europe/comments/b51u6e/holland_after_winning_the_provincial_and_senate/ejbzncy/,glory_amen,1553515451

Wrong.

5713,"The first “statement” comes from a series of satirical tweets from Annabel Nanninga, the leader of FvD Amsterdam, far before her political career when she was working for a satirical right-wing news outlet.


The second statement is not even racist or fascist. Don't you think we should be proud of the western culture? With the many freedoms we enjoy today, the tolerance toward homosexuals and all the women's right etc. You could argue that our culture is better than, let's say, some Middle Eastern countries.


The third statement was made by Jernaz Ramautarsing an unelected member of the party. He made these statements as someone with a Surinamese background and that he “wishes that people from his country had higher IQ, but that it is not the case” (I'm paraphrasing) While these statements cannot be excused, this puts them in a bit more context. He is no longer a member of FvD because of these statements. 


The fourth statement as far is I can tell is simply made up or translated very poorly. I think this comes from the recent victory speech from the party leader Thierry Baudet, when he talks about the history of The Netherlands during our golden age when we explored the world and became very prosperous because of it. 


The fifth statement is the same thing, either made up or translated poorly. He was talking about the fact that in recent history the politicians of Western Europe have allowed many hundreds of thousands of immigrants to come to Europe. These people bring with them a very different culture and different values that sometimes don't match with the values of Western culture and that this causes problems within European countries.


The sixth statement is just made up nonsense. And if I'm wrong, please provide me with a source. Thierry Baudet had written several fiction books, with some chapters describing how the male character tries to seduce a female character. This has been used to smear Baudet as a sexist.


The last statement was also made by Baudet, commenting on the fact that women on average earn less than men. The Netherlands has a long history of female empowerment and equality between the sexes. However there still exists a wage gap. Baudet crudely tried to explain why this wage gap on average still exists by saying that women have different aspirations from men.


I would appreciate it if you had a little more substance to back up your claim about FvD being a fascist party. These kind of smear tactics have lead to a Dutch political figure (Pin Fortuyn) being killed by a far-left activist in 2002. Just yesterday a protester was heard yelling: “Those who want to kill Thierry say: “bang” “bang” “bang””, during a march against racism in Amsterdam.

That is not the only option. The EU Commission is favouring a policy called ""reciprocity"" in the public procurement market. Rather than outright banning a third country from partaking in the EU's public procurement market, the EU would mandate that a third country is allowed to partake just as much as EU member states are allowed to partake in said third country's own public procurement market.

Being EU-sceptic can mean different things. It means you can be so sceptical that youve given up hope and want to leave the Union (Wilders, Farage), or it means what the vast, vast majority of EU sceptics want, changes to the EU.

  
Youre kinda a fool for thinking all EU-sceptics want to leave the Euroepan Union. If that were the case we would already have had a Nexit years ago.

5889,"Oh god i made this too long. Just read tldr. I am stopping now. 

It is logically impossible. Yea their fertility rates are crazy high which progressively pushed kurdish ratio from 9% to 12% and now 15%. Lets say they will go another step and be 18% but thats it. The thing is in the end kurds will be assimilated. Kurds are learning turkish not the other way around. Half of the kurds are in the west and most of their children couldn't care less about kurdishness, they just live their life like any other turkish kid unless their parents are overzealous. Those people will melt in the end no matter what. Now people in the east. Turkish was already lingua franca of the cities in the east(even before birth of TR, countryside on the other hand would speak local languages. Now, nearly everyone not also knows turkish but they use that in daily life unless they personally know the other person knows kurdish(relative,most cases) and they can hardly pass the kurdish to their children. Sometimes they can understand but cant speak etc. Some of course enroll their children to kurdish schools where they can learn kurdish. Nearly a decade ago when this was allowed people overstated the demand and opened loads of kurdish schools, fast forward couple of year and most of them closed because there wasnt as much demand. 
Check the graph here: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Turkey
Nearly as much as people say turkish is mother tongue as kurdish in diyarbakir.  And thats in 65. And kurdish nationalists say diyarbakir is the capital of kurds. 

Anyway, what I am saying is. Kurds were not integrated before. During otto times they just did their own tribal thing in mountains, they had autonomy and ottos didnt really care about them. They were seen as a front against persia nothing more. There wasnt even high interaction between kurds and turks before turkey happened. Now they are well integrated. When turkey said they were looking for 6 new village guards in one of the southernmost provinces nearly all the eligible villages applied. 

TL; DR: kurds will assimilate in the end so realistically it will never happen. Their fertility rates are decreasing too. They are just 50 years behind us in terms of fertility rates. 

  There is already high disunity among kurd themselves(different tribes on mountains). Even the most kurdish nationalist pkk-like person i met was very angry at kurds regarding their backwardness, islamism and disunity(too tribal). Thank god she is in uk now, not our problem anymore.

Good point. So it wasn't Y-DNA, then. 

According to a study cited by Wikipedia, Krygyz people are 1/2 to 2/3 EA, Hazaras -- another central Asian ethnicity -- are around 1/2 CA (my initial study). I was unable to cobfirm your 25% EA ancestry in Turkmens, but let's just assume you're right anyway for the sake of argument.

If we were to use Turkmen people -- who would have the lowest share of EA ancestry among all CA by far -- as a proxy for CA ancestry, and ignored all other CAs, then yes, Turkish people are more than 15% central Asian.

However, labelling that share ""Turkic"" as you did in your fancy map would be highly misleading, as any non-EA ancestry is clearly of non-Turkic origin. Turkmens have extensively interbred with the local Iranian population.

Google gedmatch results of Turks instead. There is a huge difference between what that company shows and an actual calculator. And according to Gedmatch, it is mostly Middle Eastern and Central Asian. Lots of people upload their results to gedmatch aftee they get their results. Modern genetic companies have terrible components.

&gt;You're basing this on on TWO samples?? Also, the different Turkish provinces have different birth rates and people migrate from province all the time. That data is outdated and two samples is way too flimsy evidence.

You do realize 2 medieval samples are what we only have right? And they confirm that Oghuzes that migrated are virtually same as Turkmens (as expected)

5965,"Which is why we should help Africa to get to higher standers of living if you really want to do something about that. Helping poor nations develop is the best cure for overpopulation (*and* uncontrolled, illegal immigration). South Africa's birth rate, for instance, is at 2.46, down from 6.45 in the 1960s.

But saying you actually want to help these countries develop, is not done in the populist era. You'll get downvoted into oblivion for even mentioning it.

Lower birth rates are also happening in certain muslim countries (Malaysia birth rate: 2.04, down from 6.45 in the 1960s. Indonesia (largest muslim nation in the world by population) birth rate: 2.36, down from 5.67 in the 1960s. Bangladesh birth rate: 2.10, down from 6.85 in the 1960s (East Pakistan). Iran birth rate: 1.66, down from 6.91 in the 1960s). And they're not even at our living standards, not even close, but they have been catching up and it shows in the birth rate.

And Turkey's birth rate itself is at 2.05 right now, down from 5.96 in the 1960s.

While globalism hasn't been particularly great for the middle class in the West, it has been great for the rest of the world, especially the (former) third world countries. It shows in the birth rate.

Prosperity isn't the only factor, though. Education is important as well.

""We're not special, we just had a head [start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5EQt348).""

Having said that, all these programs and ideas and tax benefits (in, for instance, Poland and Hungary) to improve the birth rate are useless, imho. They only show a small bump in the birth rate, but nothing spectacular. And it's only temporary and they cost a lot of money. You won't get close to the replacement rate of 2.1 by enforcing fuck plans; people who prosper, just don't want to have a lot of kids. 

If you really wanna get to the replacement rate (and sustain ethnic population levels), you need to get dirt poor again.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/b55t6z/poland_spain_and_turkey_population_comparison/ejbmqhq/,Leocto,1553495797
