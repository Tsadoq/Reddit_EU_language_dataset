34,"&gt;You start with the premise that regulations such as this make it noticeably harder to start a business. I disagree. As long as you follow a plan that is not based on shady tactics, you will be fine. 

Really? Tell me, do you need to do *any* extra work because of this kind of regulation when making a new web service? If the answer is ""yes,"" then it increases the barrier to entry into this field.

&gt;If anything it mostly hinders major already existing companies that usesd to operate without concern of citizens privacy.

Barriers to entry tend to overwhelmingly favor large existing corporations.

---

The answer to my earlier question is undoubtedly ""yes."" You absolutely need to do extra work to comply with the GDPR. An example: email is considered personally identifying information, which means that if your web service has a login system, then you need to figure out whether you are and how you are compliant with the GDPR. This takes extra work. You add enough of these small things that require ""extra work"" together and you have significantly less business in the sector. Examples of other such limitations are the complexity of the tax system, how much and what you have to keep track of in book-keeping etc.

The problem with the GDPR is that it has many of these small things that will increase the costs of doing business. You have to worry about it, even if you don't do anything malicious with the data, because of how vaguely the GDPR was written and how large the potential penalties are.

Worst of all, a company like Facebook can likely just get you to consent to it anyway, in which case it's mostly moot.

---

EDIT: one more thing. There's something weird in the GDPR: it requires that if a service asks for your consent to handle your data, and you refuse, then the service must still work without problems.

False.

The Spaniards that have their nation recognised actively deny that right they have for granted to the national minorities.

Which is a big deal of where the whole conflict started, btw.

Right now, millions of Spaniards are celebrating our representatives and association leaders being held in preemptive jail, so there's that too.

You wear an English flag, so you should know about how the US Constitution includes the natives in the preamble. Similar thing happens over here, we're recognised, but only symbolically —and in a lesser extent than the american natives I'd say. And as it happens on the US, that threshold will be exploited by those that are majority.

&gt;You disliking Spain's existence sounds like a personal problem to me (I mean, I feel for you, but them's the cards, maybe somewhere there's a parallel universe where Catalan nationalists are in charge...*shudder*). 

Well of course it's a personal problem! Mine and of about 3-5 million people in Spain, if we're to take into account the people from the other national minorities.

One would say that having had a terrorist band for half a century, being about that same kind of identitarian conflict, would have taught Spaniards something about the reality of their own country, but apparently not many learnt anything about the plurality of the country they live in —and they'll proceed like you're doing here: with condescendence and contempt.

&gt;Lmao by the way no one believes they own you (another 100% opinion that you try and make sound as if it has a basis in reality), but you better believe you and your ilk have no right to any kind of unilateral change to our constitutional situation. 

We are owned de facto when our decisions are subject, bc of demography, to what the gross of Spaniards feels about us. For every independentist, there're 10 people against.

Any change to the Constitution will be done by Spaniards and for Spaniards. The national minorities don't get a say in it, they're not enough to do so.","Yes, I'm an independentist",/r/europe/comments/8k1t28/the_spanish_monarchy_is_the_european_monarchy/dz86f9g/,Erratic85,1526711766

&gt;Canada[edit]

External image￼ Map identifying baselines and territorial sea in the Canadian Arctic islands;[15]retrieved 25 March 2017


Canada ratified UNCLOS on 7 November 2003 and had through 2013 to file its claim to an extended continental shelf. As of December 2013, Canada had announced that it would file a claim which includes the North Pole.[16] Canada plans to submit their claim to a portion of the Arctic continental shelf in 2018.[17]


In response to the Russian Arktika 2007 expedition, Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister, Peter MacKay, said ""[t]his is posturing. This is the true north strong and free, and they're fooling themselves if they think dropping a flag on the ocean floor is going to change anything... This isn't the 14th or 15th century.""[18][19] In response, Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, stated ""[w]hen pioneers reach a point hitherto unexplored by anybody, it is customary to leave flags there. Such was the case on the Moon, by the way... [W]e from the outset said that this expedition was part of the big work being carried out under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, within the international authority where Russia's claim to submerged ridges which we believe to be an extension of our shelf is being considered. We know that this has to be proved. The ground samples that were taken will serve the work to prepare that evidence.""[20]


On 25 September 2007, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said he was assured by Russian President Vladimir Putin that neither offence nor ""violation of international understanding or and Canadian sovereignty"" was intended.[21][22] Harper promised to advise the Crown to defend Canada's claimed sovereignty by building and operating up to eight Arctic patrol ships, a new army training centre in Resolute Bay, and the refurbishing of an existing deepwater port at a former mining site in Nanisivik.[23

113,"&gt; We are the tax payers of Europe and when the money are spent in European companies it circulates back. When the money is spent on American companies it may be less but it is out of our economy and into theirs. 

You are not made better-off by stockpiling money.

Let's imagine that you cleverly avoid trading with everyone else, using their services.  But you offer services to the rest of the world, of course, so that you can make money.

What will happen?

Your bank account will rise.  But you won't be able to *spend* it on anything useful.  Remember, you stopped buying things from the outside world to ""make yourself richer"".  The only thing you can do is spend that money internally, and workers domestically are very expensive because everyone has a large bank account, so prices are high.  The actual *stuff* that you wind up getting — apples, satellites launched, whatever — is reduced.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism

Europe once thought that this sort of policy was a good idea.  It was hundreds of years ago when European proto-economists figured out the problems in it and clued the world in.

Today, we understand that you're made better off in terms of seeking to engage in trade, to leverage [comparative advantage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage).

In the long run, countries are in trade equilibrium with the rest of the world.  Blocking an import is just blocking an export.

Now, there may be legitimate reasons to buy launch services  in Europe.  Maybe the cost is a worthwhile tradeoff on national security grounds, where national security is a positive externality.

Oh God here goes.
Well firstly they say that the actual 'place of Finland' is just Eastern Sweden. Helsinki is in Eastern Sweden and when people fly there it's not like they would notice.
World maps are altered as it's a U.N conspiracy to keep people believing in Finland. And the idea that an entire country is made up seems so bizarre that nobody would ever believe it, making it easy to do.
Finland's main company, Nokia, is apparently owned by the Japanese and they're a main player in this.
Now as for 'why' people would want to invent Finland as a country that's a bit more in depth and there's a few reasons as to why Sweden and Russia go along with it but it's mostly to do with Japanese fishing rights.
You see the Japanese love their sushi but tight fishing regulations and public outcry mean they can't fish as much as they want. So after the Cold War they agreed with Russia to create a 'landmass' called Finland where they could fish. After all, if people thought there was a country there nobody would expect the Japanese to be harpooning whales would they?
The fish is then transported through Russia where a small percentage of the food is given to the population, (they were of course starving at the time of Finland being invented), and then is shipped to Japan under the disguise of 'Nokia' products. Japan is apparently one of the worlds largest importers of Nokia products despite the fact that 'nobody there owns a Nokia phone' apparently.
The crux of all this however, and my favourite part, is the homage that the Japanese gave to this entire conspiracy theory.
What do fish have? Fins. Therefore they named their imaginary country Finland.
There are loads more that they go on about but I can't remember it all at the moment.

Suddenly? It was a contentious part of the negotiations for the JCPOA. 
&gt;Despite attempts to include ballistic missiles in an agreement over Iran’s nuclear programme, Iran’s resistance proved too difficult to overcome. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) took a compromise approach, relegating the matter to a new United Nations Security Council resolution—Resolution 2231—and imposing an eight-year conditional ban.

218,"I believe a differing view could be of merit here. If Iran was to actually restart their program then you are right, the deal is dead. However, outside of pr tokens restarting it is not in the countries interests in my opinion. 

Iran has been forced into economic isolationism from the western world for decades now. The sway the west has on Iran's existing economic is relatively low (relative to to the economic size of other trading countries). Economically what Iran sees in the west is a chance to combat its gripping economic crisis. If the west minus the US is still able to give Iran this chance then one of the main drivers behind Irans commitment is still valid. In my opinion, given the sizes of the european economy and especially the total sizes of the economies still maintaining this deal that should be achievable.

US armed forces do not play a part in the same game. Outside of Iran itself a military clash could reasonably only happen in Syria imho and that ship has sailed.  
I don't believe that attacking Iran itself on any meaningful scale is a viable strategy. For one Iran has a functioning air defense and is, well, naturally well suited for hiding potential targets. This makes a bombing campaign very high attrition. A ground invasion would have to cope up with just about the least suitable terrain for such an invasion on earth (mountainous desert) after the Himalayas. Checking especially with the track record of previous invasion and comparing the relevant populations success here would be highly unlimited. Besides, the US is the main influencer of both Israel and Saudi Arabia as well as Egypt (and at least nominally Turkey). If it gains control over Iran it controls all of the major factions in the middle east. This could translate into a de facto control of the oil and nat gas prices. Given that is the lifeblood of the Russian economy I wouldn't be surprised if they would be willing to go to war directly to stop such an occurrence. Given the reliance of other major powers, such as the EU and China, on this price there is going to be further pushback from this side.

So all one is left with is to harass civilian shipment. The US would certainly be in a position were this is possible, but would on the same token lose much more than Iran on the international floor. 

It boils down to what the other parties of the deal want, and I believe we have seen as predictable as clear statements on this front.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/8ke8cj/eu_considers_iran_central_bank_transfers_to_beat/dz7wb41/,Bartsches,1526695815

&gt;Iran's nuclear ambitions causes an arms race with it's neighbor's. Is that surprising?

KSA has ballistic missle arsenal since 1988. Its Strategic Missile Forces have been established in 1986.

Why do hawks are now so hell-bent on nuking it? What exactly do they give as a reason?

*Iran regional ambition*. Which is a joke. Iran outplayed you in Iraq in which US itself failed miserably by understanding nothing about that country, nor about its region.

Instead Jared now supports MbS whose first thing in office was order bombing campaign over Yemen that in years afterwards totally failed in its military objectives and turned whole country into giant humanitarian diasaster zone.

228,"&gt;This slogan refers to a win\-lose strategy

&gt;‘America First’ was always a slogan aimed at Washington politicians who placed too much time, attention and resources on Geopolitical endeavors \(Middle East\), instead of domestic issues

&gt;America First is about focusing on domestic issues and funding those issues instead of foreign endeavours

""America First"", like ""Make America Great Again"", has no meaning.  It's not meant to.   It's just a vapid saying that Trump uses that people project their own meaning on to.  ""America First"" somehow means simultaneously that we need to get out of the ""bad"" Iran nuclear deal and enter into a ""good"" North Korea nuclear deal.  It means we need ""no more stupid wars"", while fundamentally changing nothing about our Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria strategy.

""America First"" and ""Make America Great Again"" are just mouth noises.  It's the kind of half\-baked sentiment your not\-too\-bright baby boomer uncle would say over Thanksgiving dinner.  It makes him \*feel\* better, but it's not about any specific policy.  He just wants people in power who remind him of himself.  To ascribe any kind of deep meaning concerning international trade, domestic spending, or defense strategy on to these sentiments is giving Trump and the baby boomer uncle way too much credit.",,/r/europe/comments/8kbh6i/if_its_america_first_then_europe_will_respond_in/dz7wso5/,Zachrist,1526696433

&gt;#Italy’s coalition: the key policy pledges 
&gt;
&gt;**Five Star and League close in on forming populist government together**
&gt;
&gt;Italy’s two big anti-establishment parties, the Five Star Movement and the far-right League, are closing in on forming a populist government together — the first time such Eurosceptic forces will run one of the eurozone’s largest economies and a watershed moment for the EU.
&gt;
&gt;At the heart of their agreement is a coalition document published on Friday that is being put to the two parties’ respective members and would form the basis for their co-operation in power in Rome.
&gt;
&gt;Here are some of the important policy pledges within the 58-page agreement.
&gt;
&gt;**Europe**
&gt;
&gt;* An overhaul of all EU fiscal and monetary rules. “It’s necessary to review the structure of European economic governance, which is asymmetric, and based on the dominance of the market compared to the broader social and economic dimension.”
&gt;
&gt;* A review of all rules related to the single market — “which have accumulated over time and do not respond to citizens’ interests”, including the Bolkestein directive which sought to liberalise EU economies and had “prejudicial effects on the national interest”.
&gt;
&gt;* Opposition to all “aspects” of trade deals like Ceta and TTIP that involve an “excessive weakening of citizens’ protections” as well as “damage to fair and sustainable competition”.
&gt;
&gt;* The EU seven-year budget, up for negotiations this year, must be “revisited with the aim of making it consistent with this government contract”. The mechanisms of management of EU funds designated for Italy must be “reformed”.
&gt;
&gt;**Taxes**
&gt;
&gt;* The introduction of a double-tiered “flat tax” regime on income for individuals and companies, with rates set at 15 per cent and 20 per cent, as well as a fixed deduction of €3,000 for families, leading to more “fiscal equity”.
&gt;
&gt;* The “sterilisation” of the safeguard clauses in Italian law that would trigger automatic VAT increases next year, an “intolerable hit for families and companies”.
&gt;
&gt;* Removal of an extra tax on electronic cigarettes and the “anachronistic” elements of the excise tax on petrol
&gt;
&gt;* The installation of a “fiscal peace” between the government and citizens, loosening the power of tax authorities.
&gt;
&gt;**Spending**
&gt;
&gt;* Italian citizens below a certain income level will receive €780 per person to “guarantee the dignity of the individual and stoke the working potential of our country”.
&gt;
&gt;* A €2bn investment for the reorganisation and strengthening of employment centres to help the jobless find work.
&gt;
&gt;* Scrapping the 2011 Fornero pension reform by allowing people the chance to leave work if the “sum of their age and years of contribution is equal to 100”.
&gt;
&gt;* Free day care for Italian families and an “economic prize” for all women who return to work after maternity leave.
&gt;
&gt;**Immigration**
&gt;
&gt;* A “review” of EU missions in the Mediterranean, to prevent arrivals of boats in Italian ports without “shared responsibility” from other countries.
&gt;
&gt;* The reform of the Dublin treaty to force the “automatic and mandatory relocation of asylum seekers among EU member states”.
&gt;
&gt;* The establishment of “temporary stay facilities” in each region to house as many as 500,000 migrants earmarked for deportation within 18 months, a “priority which cannot be delayed”.
&gt;
&gt;* Stepped-up checks and the illegal closure of radical Islamic associations, mosques and places of worship through the creation of a special law.
&gt;
&gt;Banking
&gt;
&gt;* A “radical” review of EU bail-in rules, which “provoked the destabilisation of credit in Italy with negative consequences for families, which saw their savings expropriated”.
&gt;
&gt;* A “discussion” over Basel ratings protocols, which “create grave prejudice for the survival and the development of small Italian businesses”.
&gt;
&gt;* The “redefinition” of the “goals and mission” of Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the bailed-out Italian bank in which the state is a majority shareholder.
&gt;
&gt;* A move towards a separation between investment banking and traditional lending, both in terms of their activities and their supervision.
&gt;
&gt;**Foreign policy**
&gt;
&gt;* Membership of Nato is confirmed, with the US as a “privileged ally”, alongside an opening to Russia, which should not be seen as a “threat” but as an “increasingly important economic and trade partner”. Sanctions should be withdrawn.
&gt;
&gt;* Refocusing Italy’s attention on the southern front and intensification of co-operation with countries fighting terrorism.
&gt;
&gt;* Review of Italy’s military missions abroad to evaluate if they properly meet the country’s national interest.
&gt;
&gt;* Reforming election procedures for Italian voters living abroad.
&gt;
&gt;Industry
&gt;
&gt;* Alitalia should be “relaunched” in the context of a transport plan that “cannot do without the presence of a competitive national carrier”, implying a halt to the sale process.
&gt;
&gt;* The high-speed railway between Turin and Lyon will be reviewed “in its entirety”.
&gt;
&gt;* Rai, the state television, will have new “guidelines based on greater transparency, the elimination of political patronage and the promotion of meritocracy”.
&gt;
&gt;* Incentives for the purchase of hybrid and electric vehicles to speed up Italy’s implementation of the Paris climate accord.

There were a lot of Unteroffizier fighter pilots in the Luftwaffe. See for example:

or

[http://don\-caldwell.we.bs/jg26/cas\_ad.htm](http://don-caldwell.we.bs/jg26/cas_ad.htm)

Ulrich Steinhilper wrote in his autobiography that one of the replacement pilots his unit was sent during the Battle of Britain was a  Gefreiter \(and he complained that his training was inadequate\).

Edit: Just noticed there are several Gefreiters listed as casualties in the both the loss lists I linked to as well.

Edit 2: The pilot in question was Uffz Oswald Fischer, 10 Jabo Staffel, JG 26, shot down off Beachy Head by a flak ship on 20 May 1942: 

[http://don\-caldwell.we.bs/jg26/cas\_eh.htm](http://don-caldwell.we.bs/jg26/cas_eh.htm)

\&gt; Also Bf 109s had pretty bad range and needed drop tanks to increase their range for the dogfights taking place over the british isles which makes a bomb load highly unlikely. 

The Luftwaffe began bombing attacks with Bf 109s on the UK in July 1940. By later in the year large numbers had been modified, and on 15 October they flew 175 bombing attacks on London.

I believe the Bf 109F had a bit longer range, which would have made it even easier to carry out bombing attacks on the UK than with the 1940 109E.",,/r/europe/comments/8k7fub/erich_the_black_devil_hartmann_the_most/dz7o5kf/,WhiteSatanicMills,1526685859

279,"While you are right with that, i think it's important to also give more context.

&gt;Poland doesn't want Russian gas

Poland doesn't want Russian gas, but it still uses Russian gas. Want and can are different things. Again it isn't impossible for single countries to change their source of natural gas, it is impossible for all of Europe to do so.

&gt;Ukraine doing without Russian gas for 900 days already

On paper at least. It still uses Russian gas. (As in the gas that actually runs in the pipelines to Ukraine is from Russia)

This is actually one of the reasons why i think NS2 will be good for Europe as a whole. So far Russia has been a reliable source for Germany. The less non Russian gas Germany uses, the more gas from for example Norway is available to the rest of the countries in Europe.

The total input of natural gas to the inner EU pipeline system stays the same and we can rather freely modify which country receives what amounts of natural gas from what source.

As pipelines are only 1 way, the actual gas used will stay the same anyway. But in case Poland (for example) has issues with Russia, it could on paper buy all their gas from Norway while Germany on paper reduces it's import from Norway and increases it from Russia.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/8kbh6i/if_its_america_first_then_europe_will_respond_in/dz7odoo/,Alcobob,1526686128

1) Plenty of Democrats at the time were opposed to the deal as well. There was only just barely not enough votes to actually override a veto on it(1 or 2 votes shy of 60 iirc).

2) Even if that weren't the case, we're a democracy, not a dictatorship. We don't grant presidents the power to make whatever deals they like all on their own and then force future administrations to abide by them.

That's the point. If at least 30% of people believe it, they already won. What they are doing is twisting or manipulating Quim's articles, to make people believe he said things he actually never said. Like with ""Spaniards are beasts"". He never said that. But to know this, you have to read the original article. And El País assumes majority of Spaniards won't do so, since they are in Catalan language. It's perfect.

This El País article is a good example:

By reading the [original article](http://www.elpuntavui.cat/article/7-vista/8-articles/710557-pioners-de-la-independencia.html) it is clear. El País takes a word from the 1st paragraph and connects it with a sentence from 2 paragraphs below, creating a new sentence (and meaning) that doesn't exist in the original article.

The Danzig Crisis Timeline

24 Oct 1938 	Joachim von Ribbentrop met with Polish ambassador Józef Lipski at Berchtesgaden in southern Germany. During the meeting, he noted that Danzig was German and Germany wanted to see it back within German borders. He also noted that Germany wanted to build a highway and a railway through western Poland to connect East Prussia with the main German territory, and that Germany would like to have Poland join the Anti-Comintern Pact.

31 Oct 1938 	Poland noted to the Germans that Danzig was to remain independent, and that Poland was not interested in signing the Anti-Comintern Pact.

24 Nov 1938 	Adolf Hitler ordered his top military leaders to prepare plans for the invasion of the Free City of Danzig, but careful to include that it was not to include war with Poland.

5 Jan 1939 	Adolf Hitler met Polish Foreign Minister Józef Beck at Berchtesgaden in southern Germany and, in a friendly manner, mentioned that Danzig was German, and it was in his interest to one day see it return within German borders.

26 Jan 1939 	Joachim von Ribbentrop arrived in Warsaw, Poland and spoke to Polish leaders regarding the German wish to annex Danzig and to have Poland sign the Anti-Comintern Pact.

21 Mar 1939 	French President Albert Lebrun visited London, England, United Kingdom. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain attempted to persuade Lebrun to enter into a British-French-Polish alliance to contain Germany; a similar proposal was also sent to the Polish leadership via the British ambassador in Warsaw, Poland, but the Polish responded coolly. On the same day, in Berlin, Germany, German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop expressed that if Poland continued to not agree with German demands for Danzig and if Poland continued to resist signing the Anti-Comintern Pact, then the present German-Polish friendship would deteriorate.

22 Mar 1939 	Poland requested consultations with United Kingdom and France regarding German demands for Danzig. United Kingdom and France expressed willingness to go further than mere consultation and suggested a formal treaty.

25 Mar 1939 	German intelligence chief Wilhelm Canaris reported to Adolf Hitler that his agents had detected Polish troop movements on the Polish border with Danzig. Hitler met with Army chief Walther von Brauchitsch regarding this latest development in his attempt to acquire Danzig.

28 Mar 1939 	Polish Foreign Minister Józef Beck met with the German Ambassador in Poland that any further demand on Danzig by Germany might result in war between Poland and Germany.

30 Mar 1939 	British Ambassador in Poland Howard Kennard offered Poland a British-French-Polish agreement in which the three countries would mutually guarantee each others' borders; this agreement arose from the build-up of tension between Germany and Poland over Danzig. The Soviet Union was purposely excluded from the negotiations per Polish demands.

31 Mar 1939 	British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain noted that the United Kingdom and France would guarantee Polish borders, with military force if necessary.

6 Apr 1939 	The 30 Mar 1939 British-French-Polish agreement to mutually guarantee each others' borders was signed into a formal treaty in London, England, United Kingdom.

20 Apr 1939 	Italian Ambassador in Berlin, Germany, Attalico, sent a message to Rome, Italy, noting that war between Germany and Poland seemed imminent.

28 Apr 1939 	In a two-hour speech to the German Reichstag which was widely broadcast around the world, Adolf Hitler repudiated the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and expressed the wish to annex Danzig. In regards to the recent British-Polish treaty, Hitler claimed that it broke the terms of the 1934 German-Polish non-aggression treaty, thus the 1934 agreement was now void; he was, however, willing to negotiate a new one with Poland. Finally, addressing US President Franklin Roosevelt's letter of 14 Apr 1939, in which Roosevelt requested Germany to guarantee the borders of 31 nations, Hitler noted the result of the subsequent survey that revealed most of the nations (Poland excluded) responded they were not at all threatened by Germany.

5 May 1939 	Polish Foreign Minister Józef Beck spoke to the Polish Parliament, noting that the German-Polish relationship was rapidly deteriorating due to Germany's bullying tactics.

6 May 1939 	Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano met with his German counterpart Joachim von Ribbentrop in Milan, Italy, where Ciano informed Ribbentrop that Italy would not be ready for war for another three years. Ribbentrop noted the comment, and informed Ciano that Adolf Hitler did not yet have any plans for war.

7 May 1939 	The French ambassador in Berlin, Germany dispatched a warning to French leadership of deteriorating German-Polish relations.

9 May 1939 	The French ambassador in Berlin, Germany dispatched another warning to French leadership, noting that he had reasons to believe that Adolf Hitler was presenting or was about to present a plan to Joseph Stalin for the partition of Poland.

23 May 1939 	Adolf Hitler held a long speech before his top military commanders, starting by noting Danzig as a means to engage Poland in a war to gain Lebensraum (""living space"") for the German people, and then digressing to note the possibility of war with Britain and France, the need to occupy the Low Countries for their airfields, and strategies for a war in western Europe and the Atlantic.

19 Jun 1939 	The German Army reported that thus far 168 officers had been infiltrated into Danzig in prepration of action.

21 Jul 1939 	British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax wrote to British Ambassador to Poland Clifford Norton, asking him to expressed to the Polish government the British desire for Poland to refrain from acting defiantly to recent German threats.

24 Jul 1939 	Hungarian Prime Minister Pál Teleki informed Germany and Italy that should a war broke out between Germany and Poland, Hungary would not participate in a joint invasion; German leader Adolf Hitler would soon intimidate Teleki to retract the statement. On the same day, Italian leader Benito Mussolini warned Hitler that should war break out due to the Polish-German tension, Italy would come to Germany's help, but Mussolini believed it would not be a simple Polish-German War, but rather, other nations such as the United Kingdom and France would be dragged in, leading to another great war.

4 Aug 1939 	Polish customs officials on the Danzig border began carrying arms, which alerted the Germans.

7 Aug 1939 	A group of British businessmen met with Hermann Göring in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, warning him that British public sentiment would not allow another act of appeasement, and that the public would push the British government to declare war on Germany.

9 Aug 1939 	Germany sent a message to Poland noting that its uncooperativeness to work with Germany, ie. its refusal of German demands to annex Danzig, might lead to war, and Germany would not hold the responsibility for starting an armed conflict.

10 Aug 1939 	Poland responded to Germany's message from the previous day, noting that should a war between the two nations start, it would be German aggression that started it, and Poland could not be blamed.

23 Aug 1939 	Albert Forster was appointed by the German government as the State President of the Free City of Danzig.

26 Aug 1939 	French Prime Minister Édouard Daladier sent a message to German leader Adolf Hitler, noting that while France desired peace, it would fight for Poland should it be invaded.

27 Aug 1939 	German leader Adolf Hitler responded to the message from French Prime Minister Édouard Daladier from the previous day, noting that Germany had no intention of fighting France, so if France was to attack Germany due to the German-Poland situation, it would be a war initiated by France, and Germany could not be faulted for such a conflict; additionally, Hitler stressed that Germany had no territorial demands on the German-French border. Meanwhile, Hermann Göring's friend Birger Dahlerus, a Swedish national, attempted a parallel route to negotiate for peace.

29 Aug 1939 	Through the Swedish businessman Birger Dahlerus, Germany expressed that Germany only desired Danzig and a small section of the Polish Corridor, while a plebiscite should be held in the near future to determine the fate of the remainder of the Polish Corridor.

30 Aug 1939 	Poland refused to dispatch a delegation to Germany to negotiate over the topics of Danzig and the Polish Corridor. Polish Commander-in-Chief, Marshal of Poland, Edward Rydz-Smigly ordered the mobilization of the army.

31 Aug 1939 	Adolf Hitler offered the United Kingdom that Germany would not risk war if Poland was willing to turn over Danzig and a small section of the Polish Corridor, and that Poland was to allow a plebiscite for the remainder of the Polish Corridor in the near future; British Ambassador in Germany Nevile Henderson expressed that the United Kingdom, while desiring peace, could not sacrifice Poland to achieve that goal. Meanwhile, Henderson continued to press Poland to send a delegation to Germany in a last attempt to negotiate peace over Danzig and the Polish Corridor. When Polish Ambassador in Germany Józef Lipski attempted to send Henderson's message to Poland later in the evening, he found that Germany had cut telephone and telegraph communications to Poland.

2 Sep 1939 	Germany annexed the Free City of Danzig. Adolf Hitler advised the United Kingdom and France that he would withdraw from Poland if allowed to keep Danzig and the Polish corridor.

494,"Not a lawyer, but

&gt;Is it generally acceptable to use a gun for self defence 

The concept of self defence is very strictly limited. You have the right to defend yourself \(or someone else\) against an immediate threat to health or life. Even then your response must be measured and appropriate. E.g. if you had the option to flee, it will be seen as murder if you killed the attacker instead. Killing an attacker is only accepted, if no other option was available to you. On the other hand, you do not have to put yourself under undue risks. You don't have to try to disarm someone with a weapon.

Definitely not covered under the right to self defense are offences against property. Shooting burglars or thiefs will be prosecuted as murder.

507,"&gt;This is completely wrong.

Is it? 

Those values *did* vanish. [Churchill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0274DBjrZQ) reacted to it happening. Those affirmations were needed *because* those values were under attack. 

1215 is late Medieval ages, nearing the beginning of the end. Between the collapse of the Roman Empire and 1215 those values weren't exactly protecting the common man.

And they were gone during certain periods of time after 1215 as well.

&gt;And again, very rarely top-down supra-national inter-ethnic political unions didn't end up at some point in bloody civil wars.

Again? You were talking about top-down entities earlier. Not top-down supra-national inter-ethnic political unions. There haven't been many of those around in the history of mankind. Especially not like the EU. We don't have many historical entities to compare it with. So your comment earlier that ""history tells us that those kind of political unions don't really end well"" doesn't really apply.

Civil wars started over many things, not just political unions. Ultranationalism, for instance, works very well, too.

I need to call it a day. I don't disagree completely though. I never claimed one *needs* this EU to keep the peace, to prosper and to secure all of those values. The EU isn't sacred to me. You can find that in my history post, but I wouldn't recommend looking at it, since it's filled with shouting as well.

511,"&gt; If Germany is truly aligned to the ideals of liberal democracy then they should keep relations with Russia to a minimum.

Germany works with different governments, regardless of the type of government in power as long as it is beneficial to us. (Beneficial also means more good than bad) Number 1 goal of Germany is to keep Germany safe.

Russia is a cornered Tiger. It will not go away and you cannot forcefully change its behavior, it will stay a tiger. If we needlessly threaten it or don't supply it with some food, it will strike at us if it is beneficial to them.

Right now and for the foreseeable future it is more beneficial for Russia to not strike. It would gain nothing it cannot gain for cheaper by buying it from us. This is what Germany keeps safe.

When you conduct international business or diplomacy, you should always remember what you have that other people might want and how costly it would be to get that. A war always has a high cost, but if there is no cheaper way to get it, it might be right path to follow.

This isn't a moral issue. Ukraine is the best example for it. After the revolution it wasn't clear if Ukraine was still willing to offer use of Crimea to Russia at all, at which point taking it with war became a valid option. Again, this has nothing to do with morals, it was deeply amoral, but a valid strategic choice.

606,"&gt; Trump is a bumbling fool and basically degenerated to a point where he might need a legal guardian to manage his life, he acts whimsically and changes his opinions randomly.

Merkel would disagree:

&gt; The Chancellor was not surprised by Trump's behavior. **She occasionally points out that he had already announced everything he had planned during the election campaign.** According to her assessment, he is now working through this. The closer the next congress elections come in autumn, the more demonstrative. Only those have to revise, Merkel thinks, who thought at the beginning that things would not be so bad.
&gt; 
&gt; Therefore, unlike Martin Schulz, for example, the Chancellor would not call Trump irrational. **In his categories, so her perception, Trump behaves predictably.** And in his first year in office, Merkel heard from him again and again about two of these categories: America has been ripped off for decades, and that is over. And all his predecessor Barack Obama left him was crap anyway. In Trump's view, the Iran Agreement brings the two together.
&gt; 
&gt; Merkel was never particularly enthusiastic about this agreement. She has gone along with it rather than vehemently pushing it forward. She always had understanding for some objections from Israel and also made the Federal Government the advocate of Israeli interests during the negotiations after the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu was destroyed. The Chancellor therefore does not see the responsibility for the weaknesses of the agreement in Berlin. In 2015, when the treaty was concluded, the result of their consideration was not 100:0 but rather 55:45 - and the decisive factor was that according to the information available at the time the Iranian nuclear programme was well advanced and under time pressure.

609,"White smoke rose over Lampoldshausen in January. In a test stand of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Baden-Württemberg, engineers set fire to the powerful rocket engine ""Vulcain 2.1"" for the first time. In a series of tests its properties should be checked closely.

With a thrust of 130 tons, the unit, which is partly manufactured in a 3D printer, will help to launch the future ""Ariane 6"" rocket into space. Europe's states are currently working on it with billions of efforts - to replace the reliable but no longer competitive ""Ariane 5"".

The new rockets are manufactured in Bremen and near Paris, and will then take off from the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana. There is currently the new launch pad. In two years, it will give the maiden flight from there.

But the ""Ariane 6"" has a problem: it is too expensive compared to the American competition. Specifically, it is about the rockets of the - strongly supported by the US government - private company SpaceX. They are - used - for about 50 million dollars per start to have. It is a price that the Ariane 6 can never reach, even if, as promised, the cost is halved compared to the Ariane 5.

SpaceX boss Elon Musk has also announced that the launch costs will even drop sharply with the latest version of his ""Falcon 9"" (""Block 5"") rocket . So what should Europe do? Benefit from the cheap offers of the Americans - even at the risk that someday will end? Or, with billions of dollars, keep your own access to space?

Alain Charmeau is the boss of the Ariane Group. In an interview, he explains that from his point of view Musk can only offer his fight prizes thanks to massive help from Washington - and what problems the Europeans can get involved with. Whether his arguments will convince European leaders, will show. Only if they could guarantee the ""Ariane 6"" a foundation of operations, the rocket would really be built in series, so Charmeau.",,/r/europe/comments/8kexo5/americans_want_to_kick_europe_out_of_space_german/dz730f5/,pisshead_,1526664577

611,"SPIEGEL ONLINE: The new ""Ariane 6"" rocket is scheduled to launch in July 2020 for the first time. Can you do that?

Charmeau: Yes. We are on schedule.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: So that the project does not become a piper, you need support. Europe's governments should commit to buy a certain amount of rockets. What commitments do you have meanwhile?

Charmeau: The first start is funded with the development contract. Now we need customers for launches number two, three and so on. After all, we have already received an order from the European Commission.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: There they want to buy two missiles for ""Galileo"" navigation satellites.

Charmeau: According to our plans, we need a total of five launches in 2021 and eight in 2022. Part of this needs to be done by the governments or the EU Commission.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: What do you imagine?

Charmeau: We are thinking of a total of four ""Galileo"" launches, plus a probe from the Esa, plus one German and one French government mission. We need a clear signal that we can start producing the other rockets. And we need a total of seven contracts for guaranteed launches. Till the end of June.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: That sounds sporty. And why just until the end of June?

Charmeau: Because the production of the first rocket is already running. Our factories, our teams now need more orders to continue their work. The second launch of the ""Ariane 6"" should already take place in late 2020 or early 2021, depending on customer requirements. That's in less than three years.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: What happens if you do not have the contracts until the end of June?

Charmeau: Without contracts, we would have to stop production.

Expensive for Washington, cheap for Europe - but why?

SPIEGEL ONLINE: You say that you need government contracts to maintain production. At the same time, the German Bundeswehr is launching its ""SARah"" reconnaissance satellites on rockets of the US company SpaceX. How does it fit together?

Charmeau: Germany spends a lot of money on the ""Ariane 6"" and has increased its share by 20 percent compared to its predecessor ""Ariane 5"". I am convinced that the German government is interested in the utilization of the plants in their country. That's why satellites - for defense and others - will be launched with our ""Ariane"" and ""Vega"" missiles.
SPIEGEL ONLINE: Even with militarily sensitive satellites Germany does not do that.

Charmeau: But in the future they might do it.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: Meanwhile SpaceX is cheaper.

Charmeau: Sorry, but that's not true. One should ask why SpaceX bills the US government $ 100 million per launch, but launches much cheaper for European customers. Why are they doing that?

SPIEGEL ONLINE: Because they can offer such launches for commercial customers - as well as the German government - cheaper.

Charmeau: You do that to kick Europe out of space. And the public and our politicians should know that. It is about the question of whether Europe will still be active in space tomorrow. Our US friends do not really support that. I am signing contracts with European governments for $ 100 million per launch. That is the price that SpaceX demands from its own government. If, however, Germany wants to start shopping cheaper, our US competitor will benefit from it.
SPIEGEL ONLINE: Why should a government spend more money on a start than it has to? You can also use the money to build roads and bridges or rehabilitate schools.

Charmeau: The simplest reason: It creates jobs in Germany. And these companies and their employees pay taxes that end up in the German budget. I am pretty sure that SpaceX employees pay nothing to the German tax office. And it's about more.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: And that?

Charmeau: It's about the business of the future. Why are all the billionaires investing in space? Why is Jeff Bezos coming to Germany too and declaring that the country should not go into space? He makes money with your personal information. Today he knows your Amazon orders, tomorrow he drives your car.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: He'll probably do that anyway. We have long since said goodbye to our data in many fields. I'm just recording this conversation with an iPhone. Since I have given my data but long ago.

Charmeau: Should not we at least try to fight for independence? We still have an industry for rockets and satellites that is absolutely in the lead worldwide. Should we give that up?

SPIEGEL ONLINE: Conversely asked: Why should we keep it partout?

Charmeau: First there are the economic reasons. There will be a huge market for the evaluation of space data in the future, for the Internet of Things, autonomous cars and so on. But there are also strategic reasons. Germany and France want to work together to build a future fighter plane . Such a plane does not fly without space technology. We can not give that up.

Spacecraft ""IXV"": Before the hot hell ride
SPIEGEL ONLINE: One of the reasons that SpaceX can offer its launches so cheaply is that the company relies on reusability. When does the first ""Ariane"" rocket stage gently return to Earth so it can be reused?

Charmeau: The reason SpaceX is cheaper on the commercial market has nothing to do with reusability. The only thing that matters is that they charge their own government $ 100 million per launch. And I'm ready to do that too.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: Nonetheless, SpaceX says they can offer their rockets cheaply through reusability.

Charmeau: How do you know that? Do you know their real cost structure?

SPIEGEL ONLINE: For me as a customer it is certainly cheaper to fly my satellite on a used SpaceX than on an ""Ariane"".

Charmeau: Because the company is over-spending too much money on your government.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: You have already said that several times.

Charmeau: SpaceX has a guaranteed startup market for the government, maybe ten times the size of ours in Europe. Since then you can easily put the reusability in the foreground for the rest.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: You also said that reusability would not be worthwhile for Europe. As the?

Charmeau: Let's say we have ten guaranteed launches a year in Europe and have a rocket that you can reuse ten times - then we would build exactly one rocket a year. That does not make sense. I can not tell my teams: 'Bye, then until next year'!

SPIEGEL ONLINE: How many starts would you need, so that reusability is worthwhile for you?

Charmeau: That's just what we're looking at. Maybe about 30 starts a year. But we always have to ask ourselves, if these technologies pay off for us. But we definitely prepare it. For example, our future ""Prometheus"" engine is reusable. We are also working on the technology of retrieving and reusing a rocket stage.

618,"Not quite, there were many parts of the warsaw pact that faced collectivism, even brutally, but the famine that happened in Ukraine was completely unique in it's scope and scale. Elsewhere, even if you faced brutal collectivism, you would have been very unlikely to face the same risk of starving as someone in Ukraine was.

Collectivism in itself had absolutely nothing to do with the famine in Ukraine. It never approached similar death tolls elsewhere, and there were many policies that *only* existed in Ukraine that caused the mass starvation. Hell, even within Ukraine, there were plenty of areas completely famine free that had the same policies of collectivism as the parts that did have famine, but were not targeted by the same policies that made the famine so bad (e.g. ""blacklisting"" communes, that is, denial of all supplies and thorough searches for hidden food overwhelmingly happened in regions the famine occurred, also, illegal restriction of travel was significantly more enforced in areas the famine happened).

True, there was also a USSR-wide famine caused by collectivization, but it wasn't nearly as long-lasting and severe, and most of the difficulties with forced collectivization that most recipients faced wasn't starvation (at all really) but about brutal political oppression and disenfranchisement.

The idea that collectivization caused the famine has two sources;

1) That was the initial western understanding of it (and it was perpetuated by politics of the cold war, doing so made ""communism"", in general, look disastrous)

2) Post-Stalinism, when it was actually addressed, it was easiest and politically most-expedient to characterize it as policy ""mistake."" Rather than admitting that the political environment of government in the past was fine with letting millions of people starve to death.

Collectivism has such a hated memory because it was a tool of brutal political oppression and control. It was a tool that was used greatly in the implementation of policies that actually caused millions of people to starve, but in itself it is not what took food away from people, and elsewhere (or other times, too) it was also a tool for aid as well (i.e. the logistics of delivering food and supplies was also done through a commune-by-commune basis). Nor was it a source of ""shortage"" due to economic inefficiency. Although collectivism did dramatically decrease yields (especially at first), and *was* economically inefficient, the vast majority of the time it never led to producing less food than the population required.

The article you linked is literally from today. I am pretty sure the majority of Germans did not even know of those things at the time when that poll was conducted, and they probably do not know much about China to begin with. Notice also that the main difference there between the USA and China is that more people decided that they do not know enough to judge China's leadership. Meanwhile the USA is infamous for things like conducting torture while claiming to uphold allegedly shared Western values and being the main cause of the refugee crisis, with Trump and Bolton seemingly wanting to start yet another war in the Middle East.  And frankly speaking, your erratic foreign policy has more of an impact on our lives than what China does within its own borders on the other side of the planet, so it is to be expected that Germans both know and care more about the former.

The battery operated the AA search-lights. The unit was issued rifles for self-protection, thus being the only armed female military unit of the Finnish Defence Forces history.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Searchlight_Battery_(Finland)

&gt; Armed service caused a minor crisis for the Lotta Svärd organization, which had emphasized a principle of nonviolence[discuss]. Because of Soviet agent and invasion danger the Lotta Svärd central committee had to consent to arming the women in the searchlight battery. The leader of the Lotta Svärd organization, Fanni Luukkonen, said that armed service for women meant the ""death of womanhood"" (Finnish: ""naiseuden kuolema""), but that the wartime situation demanded extraordinary measures. The weapon used by the women was an Italian Terni military rifle that was also used by other anti-aircraft units.[1][2][3]

Personally i'm not into nationalism at all and the issue isn't so much nationalistic as it is patriotic (to me wanting to preserve a part of your history/culture is not nationalistic but patriotic. It's not attacking the other guy or thinking him to be lesser than you, it's protecting your own shit).

Where i disagree is that if you abandon your history, in the end it will disappear. For better or worse, Greece is a country that values its history a lot, probably cause we haven't had a lot of other things to value lately.. and while being proud of something that other people did a long time ago might seem silly (even when they're your ancestors) i think that appreciating and protecting your history is important. 

It's not like i'd lose something personally if today Alexander the Great and Macedonia was attributed to FYROM or another random country.. the only thing that would change is that i'd lose ""bragging rights"" on a meme level, lol. But still the fact that another country is after a part of history they're unrelated to, seems wrong to me. 

Furthermore, a Macedonian identity would cause trouble to Macedonian Greeks that aren't ""Slavic Macedonians"", or even products like for example Macedonian Halva which won't be the same thing anymore. Geographically speaking, there are Macedonians in Greece, Bulgaria, Albania.. having a Macedonian identity is troublesome there. 

I don't think there's a Slavs vs Greeks mentality anyway. We don't have an issue with Slavs. There are strong bonds with Serbia and we get along well with Bulgaria. Even with FYROM we don't have any other issue other than the name thing. Personally i can't wait for it to be over so that our countries can cooperate as best as we can, since i don't see any other obstacles and the people don't have any other issues between them. But yeah, since history happens to be important here and our neighbors have shown willing to try to claim it for themselves, i think that i fair compromise should be found so that we won't have frictions in the future.

This also makes it harder to start a tech sector business in the EU, because the negative opinion from the web services sector will spill over.

Less tech sector capability doesn't seem that big of a deal. After all, we can just make it up in other sectors, right? Maybe not. The future is about tech after all.

The infrastructure currently is not strong enough for the solution to be 'everyone will just buy from Germany'. Even if that was physically possible, Germany is not the source of the gas and if Russia decided that they will not send enough gas to Germany to cover the needs of all of Eastern Europe, then Germany will not just magically create that missing gas.

&gt; It would be the foremost issues everywhere and the most hostile and directly threatening thing Russia has done to the EU since 1989.

Well, nobody expected Russia to annex Crimea and start a proxy war in the Eastern Ukraine either. The security enviroment in Europe is deteriorating, alliance with the US is weakened, the EU itself deals with plenty of other issues, the UK is leaving the Union. Does that mean that Russia will likely turn very hostile to CEE? Not that likely, but also can't be ruled out. Particularely not in the case of Ukraine.

&gt; It would be the foremost issues everywhere and the most hostile and directly threatening thing Russia has done to the EU since 1989.

I'm sorry I don't just blindly believe in Germany's noble intentions and their undying commitment to the CEE region. 

&gt; then there is no reason for Germany either to trust EE in not abusing their current grip on the pipeline.

The likelihood of Russia trying to screw over you is way less likely than Russia trying to screw over EE. And Ukraine is also very unlikely to want to screw over any important country in the West, as they are completely reliant on the West currently.

912,"NS2 is about European interests. Why? Because Europe has no other source of natural gas that can supply it for 10+ years right now.

What would the next best source of gas be? Oh Iran, the same country that the US just put under sanctions again 

And the third best? That would be Qatar, another country of proven human values. A country that could not provide Europe with gas because there aren't enough LNG tankers in the world and there is no pipeline going to Europe.

The matter of fact is, if we throw all the natural gas reserves of Europe together, we wouldn't even reach the 10 year mark.

Putin is absolutely right when he asked ""Where else could Germany get it's gas from"". That doesn't mean that a single country could switch to another source, single countries could. But not all of Europe at the same time.

And the last issue is time, it's expected that by 2030 solar energy and batteries for storage will reach the point where their power is cheaper than the non renewable ones. So we have 12 years left to do something.

Construction of a pipeline takes about a decade if you include planing, permits and construction. So by the time we have a pipeline to Iran or Qatar, the pipeline has a good chance to not make a return of its investment.

Anybody who says that NS2 is not in the interrest of Europe should simply say what their alternative plan is. And besides unrealistic one liners so far nobody has brought up anything that stands up to even the most moderate of scrutiny.

No LNG is not realistic, especially from the US. As i said there aren't enough LNG tankers in the world. Even if there were, it costs way more.

Not using natural gas also doesn't work, as the transformation to renewable energy requires power plants that can react to changing production in time. All the while there still are houses that get heated with gas, which you cannot replace within 10 years until you want to invest large sums of money.

This complete topic is such an annoying non issue where people blurt out stupid shit like ""We should diversify"" and ""We're funding Russia"" with it. Well duh, should we diversify? Yeah obviously. CAN we diversify? No unless we are prepared to really invest money NOW.

And for what? That the change to solar energy comes a few years earlier? Not worth the money.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/8kbh6i/if_its_america_first_then_europe_will_respond_in/dz6i5qs/,Alcobob,1526642990

If his rethoric is something to go by, he does not considers spaniards to be even *human*.

He has also expressed his admiration by Daniel Cardona, who created the far right group Estat Catala, and who once said ""there is no way the skull of a catalan and a castilian are similar"". 

Estat Catala was active until the 80s and they published a newsletter arguing for catalans's racial superiority toward spaniards. At no point has Torra apologized or attempted to distance himself from these people.

Rebate on fees was completely fair. CAP is piss poor anti free market policy anyway that fucks over a LOT of poor countries, and we're not just going to give France billions to grow food for basically no reason.

Don't want to be in the Euro is again completely fair. It's a dysfunctional currency that will one day collapse unless the EU integrates to a far greater extent than currently (and a greater extent than member state citizens want too).

Not wanting to be in Shengen was smart and again completely fair. Do you see millions of Syrian refugees in the UK? No, just Germany. Enjoy that Shengen goodness guys, but not sure it was worth it tbh.

Not wanting to pay child benefit to children who don't even live in the UK? Pretty fair really.

Kick out people who come to the UK purely to abuse our benefits system? Pretty fair too.

""Loads of preferential treatment others don't get""... What? All we wanted was to be able to limit EU immigration to 100,000/year net for a few years. If the EU's leaders had given us that we'd have voted to remain and the EU wouldn't be losing 40% of it's military power and over 15% of it's economic power as a result. And THAT's what you call preferential treatment? Most EU countries never had to cope with this level of immigration in the first place, let alone for literally 20 years straight. In 2015 alone half a million EU citizens came to live in the UK, and 200,000 brits left. That's a demographic change of 700,000 people in a single year, in a country of just under 70 million people.

1100,"Odometer manipulating is a huge problem in Europe, not only because it is a fraud on the price of the vehicle, it also raises safety concern for the consumers. Not knowing how many kilometers a car really did before purchasing can result it accidents on motorways or very expensive, unexpected repair bills.

One partial solution from 2014 will be starting in just 3 days, from May 20th 2018. 

&gt; “As from 20 May
2018 and at the latest by 20 May 2021, testing centres shall communicate electronically, to
the competent authority of the Member State concerned, the information mentioned in the
roadworthiness certificates which they issue.” 

and

&gt; Member States shall
ensure that, for the purposes of checking the odometer, where an odometer is normally
fitted, the information included in the previous roadworthiness test is made available to
the inspectors as soon as it is available electronically. In cases where an odometer is found to
have been manipulated with the aim of reducing or misrepresenting the distance record of a
vehicle, such manipulation shall be punishable by effective, proportionate, dissuasive and
non-discriminatory penalties.

An electronically available roadworthiness test, even if it would cost more than a normal inspection, would mean that the European Union and car manufacturers could put up a fight against odometer manipulations decently, but it would require an effective work between the member states of the EU.

Odometer manipulating is a big problem in Hungary. Many people can only afford buying used cars, and there is a general problem with ""buying kilometres and not condition."" Many of the used-car buyers are willing to pay more for a car with less mileage, making them more likely to buy a car with a manipulated odometer.

National defense is one of the standard examples of a public good, and you tend to require spending on those to avoid underspending.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good

&gt;In economics, a public good is a good that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous in that individuals cannot be effectively excluded from use and where use by one individual does not reduce availability to others.

-

&gt;Public goods include knowledge, official statistics, **national security**

-

&gt;Public goods provide a very important example of market failure, in which market-like behavior of individual gain-seeking does not produce efficient results. The production of public goods results in positive externalities which are not remunerated. If private organizations do not reap all the benefits of a public good which they have produced, their incentives to produce it voluntarily might be insufficient. Consumers can take advantage of public goods without contributing sufficiently to their creation. This is called the free rider problem, or occasionally, the ""easy rider problem"" (because consumers' contributions will be small but non-zero). If too many consumers decide to ""free-ride"", private costs exceed private benefits and the incentive to provide the good or service through the market disappears. The market thus fails to provide a good or service for which there is a need.[20]
&gt;
&gt;The free rider problem depends on a conception of the human being as *homo economicus*: purely rational and also purely selfish—extremely individualistic, considering only those benefits and costs that directly affect him or her. Public goods give such a person an incentive to be a free rider.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8jxxan/european_countries_by_military_expenditures/dz62u2k/,vokegaf,1526614478

I still can't see any genocides or whole country take overs or whole colonisations. Mate, you popped up out of nowhere and claimed those have happened to Bulgarians, and now you're talking about some small scale ethnic cleansings and some border disputes, and no genocides, no mass colonisations, no mass deportations of a nation, no total annexation.

Some claim that they're Illiyrians so that's closest you can get mate.

&gt; Once again showing your ignorance of history. Pirin Macedonia is a region in Bulgaria. It is in fact Bulgaria. Upper Macedonia would be Vardar Macedonia (which is todays FYROM)

Lol, Pirin Macedonia isn't history but geography for starters. Secondly, that story is far more complicated than that. Folks in the region has a regional identity already, and they saw themselves as Macedonian Bulgarians. I'd understand if you were talking about Greece naming them Slavophone Greeks or Serbs calling them Serbs, or Pomaks in the region being called as Bulgarians by Bulgaria but your example is meh. Sorry but I havant even thought that you were referring to Macedonian region in Bulgaria since it doesn't make any sense to me. :v Anyway, since it's not a genocide, or a total annexation or a mass expulsion of a nation, I'm so moving on.

And believe me, I do know enough to say you're not able to come up with anything you've claimed, but only total ethnic cleansing attempt was on the Bulgarian Pomaks and Bulgarian Turks but even that doesn't qualify to things I was referring to, nor it was about ethnic Bulgarian bunch at the end.

&gt;In a statement on Monday, Poland’s Foreign Ministry defended the march as a largely patriotic event and “a great celebration of Poles,” 

&gt;The interior minister had previously called the rally “a beautiful sight.”

what exactly was that sight?
&gt;marchers bore signs with messages like “Europe Will Be White” and “Clean Blood.”

Why are you so outrageously anti-US?  All of your comments are extremely aggressive.

The US gets paid to maintain bases in Europe.  

http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-trump-allies-20160930-snap-story.html

I'm sure Poland and the Baltics don't want the US going anywhere either.

&gt;no EU country is obligated to reach that 2% as of yet, not until a couple of years at least.

They aren't obliged either way as it is a target and a commitment, but not a requirement. I understand that the target is a ways off, but economic situations in Europe have been improving but the military spending as a percent of gdp has flatlined in most NATO countries, or isn't being increased at a fast enough rate to reach 2% in time.

1453,"&gt; we'll have to make compromises for them as well as them compromising with us

In the past few weeks you had the SF leader using the term Londonderry, a Unionist backed by SF elected to the Senate of the 26 counties, talks about giving NI politicians observer status in the Dáil, and SF and the Irish government openly welcoming discussion around the topic of a UI and extending the conversation to Unionists.

What are the other side's politicians doing? Racially abusing our PM 3 times, calling all Irish people retards, Tories threatening to wreck our economy, Arlene Foster being Arlene Foster, Stormont shutting down because they refuse to give the Irish language the same recognition as other regional UK languages, Foster saying she will leave Ireland forever if there is a UI, several DUP figures saying that there will never be a UI.

Compare Ireland to NI since we got independence. In one place, a minority (Protestants) flourished and became as happily integrated as can be. In the other country, the minority were burned from there homes regularly, humiliated, shot in the street, refused jobs and housing, interned, belittled every step of the way. And compare Ireland to NI right now - NI is a backwater.

As has always been the case in the 6 counties, there's one rule for them and one for us. We always have to compromise, turn the other cheek, and be subjected to constant oppression (and I mean that word). 

So I find it strange you saying that the onus is on us to compromise...",,/r/europe/comments/8k8dm4/a_united_ireland_some_northern_ireland_unionist/dz5ytba/,lbcbtc,1526609680

1510,"&gt; I disagree. The US is looked at from a macro level in this context, but in reality we all know that targeting swing states would have an outsized impact in any trade war. This is the same thing, but arguably an even bigger vulnerability.

I understand that's your point. I'm not disputing that point, I'm saying his metric, ""trade / GDP"", is irrelevant because it is affected by irrelevant variables. I'm going to use an extreme and unreal example just make it more obvious.  

So the US is going to target specific EU states. OK. Now suppose EU states do 0% trade with the US and only trade (a lot) among themselves. Then what? Now suppose that the trade between themselves is smaller, what changed? Nothing because the US can't affect them. 

Like I said, it's not the case. But the fact individual countries do a lot of trade, doesn't reflect how much the US can affect the block or each individual country. Your point is different and about what happens when an individual country is affected. But you can't measure that vulnerability via the ""trade / GDP"" metric.

&gt;#Why Trump Can Safely Ignore Europe
&gt;
&gt;*Its Leaders Readily Condemn But Never Act*
&gt;
&gt;By [Jeremy Shapiro](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/authors/jeremy-shapiro)
&gt;
&gt;Europe has reacted swiftly and with great fury to U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision last week to pull out of the Iranian nuclear deal. The problem is not simply that the Trump administration has undermined one of the signature achievements of European foreign policy but that his inherent volatility, his unpredictability, and most of all his lack of commitment to the transatlantic alliance mean that any act of U.S. disruption is now possible. Righteous indignation is the language of the day, and predictions about the death of the transatlantic alliance abound.
&gt;
&gt;But laments and indignation do not add up to strategy. The real question is not whether Europeans are pissed off but whether they will do anything in response to Trump’s actions. The answer is most likely no.
&gt;
&gt;A CALL TO ARMS—AGAIN
&gt;
&gt;The U.S. withdrawal from the Iranian deal certainly feels like a critical moment in transatlantic relations. For Europeans, the [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2017-03-29/jcpoa-helps-irans-elites-and-hurts-rouhani), as the agreement's formally known, marked a rare instance in which a coordinated effort by the Europeans decisively influenced Washington’s decision on a critical international security issue. Trump’s withdrawal from the deal is therefore not merely a threat to regional stability and nonproliferation but also a repudiation of the notion that Europe can influence the United States on difficult security issues.
&gt;
&gt;Europe has unified around its condemnation of Trump’s decision. France, Germany, and the United Kingdom issued a [joint statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-statement-from-prime-minister-may-chancellor-merkel-and-president-macron-following-president-trumps-statement-on-iran) expressing their “regret and concern” and reaffirmed their intention to continue honoring the deal. [The EU itself quickly followed suit](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/iran/44238/remarks-hrvp-mogherini-statement-us-president-trump-regarding-iran-nuclear-deal-jcpoa_en) in expressing its disappointment, and so far no single European country has said that it supports the U.S. decision.
&gt;
&gt;The reaction in the media has been even more dramatic. The latest issue of the German newsmagazine *Der Spiegel* featured a cartoonish image of a left hand flipping the bird with Trump’s likeness etched on the middle finger. A related article in the issue noted that “[Europe’s] relationship to the United States cannot currently be called a friendship” and advocated joining the “resistance against America.”
&gt;
&gt;Such anger and frustration are real, but they are not new. Starting with the Suez invasion in 1956, the U.S.-European relationship has gone into a “crisis” once or twice every decade. Indeed, in 2015, during the halcyon days of the Obama administration, *Der Spiegel* used similar language after it was revealed that the [National Security Agency](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2014-04-17/reforming-nsa) had tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone. “German-American friendship no longer exists,” it wrote. “The chancellor must show Washington a clear sign of resistance. Germany must free itself from this pact.” German officials messaged in backroom seminars that the alliance could never be the same. A few months later it was the same.
&gt;
&gt;U.S. officials have heard this refrain so many times that they have developed a rather jaundiced attitude toward European “resistance.” Their view seems to be that Europeans say all manner of things but never do anything in response, so it is not necessary for Washington to pay much attention. Even during the [2003 crisis over Iraq](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iraq/2006-03-01/intelligence-policy-and-war-iraq), a supposedly shining moment of European resistance, 14 EU members actively supported the United States, including Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.
&gt;
&gt;Of course, frustrations are mounting and eventually they will matter. But before we confidently assert yet again that “this time is different,” it is worth remembering why the alliance has sustained this frustratingly unequal bargain for so long.
&gt;
&gt;THEY NEED IT MORE
&gt;
&gt;The simple answer is that Europeans need the alliance more than the Americans do. For Europe, the transatlantic alliance is its rock of stability in an otherwise ever-changing world and the foundation on which it has constructed [European security and European integration](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2017-11-30/europes-readiness-problem). Shared values and interests, much more so than with authoritarian powers such as Russia and China, also drive the bond.
&gt;
&gt;The United States does value the transatlantic alliance. It wants help on international security issues such as Afghanistan or Syria, and U.S. officials certainly enjoy proclaiming that the United States leads the world. But the reality is that the United States doesn’t need the European alliance for its own security. As Trump has implied many times, the United States can simply walk away from the relationship.
&gt;
&gt;In theory, Europeans could simply band together and provide for their own security.  Combined, they have as much economic weight and military power as the United States and far more than any of their potential rivals, including Russia. In practice, they still prefer relying on the United States for their security rather than relying on one another.
&gt;
&gt;The United States, after all, is a distant power with only a passing interest in the internal affairs of Europe. EU countries, by contrast, are deeply involved in one another’s affairs—they have multiple internal disputes that range from how to deal with their common currency to how to manage immigration. They look to their relationship with the United States not simply for security from external threats such as Russia or terrorism but also for a potential ally in their internal disputes with other EU states. Surveys by the European Council on Foreign Relations show that at least 11 European governments believe they have a “special relationship” with the United States that gives them advantages they can’t get from their European partners.

1556,"[continued from parent]

&gt;In Greece, for example, policymakers look to Washington for protection not from Russia or terrorism but from [Germany’s stringent economic policies](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/greece/2015-01-25/so-long-austerity). In Poland, the government’s distrust of the EU and other European nations, especially Germany, is palpable even as Warsaw relies on them for economic support. The Polish government does not want to increase its dependence by relying on its EU partners for protection from Russia as well. Its relationship with the United States is, in part, a diversification strategy.
&gt;
&gt;In short, Europeans, working together, could provide for their own security from external threats. The problem is that they also want political protection from one another. And only the United States can provide that.
&gt;
&gt;This asymmetric dependence lies at the [heart of the alliance](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-03-05/world-after-trump) and means that so far Europeans have had to make their peace with the Trump administration. Yes, European leaders frequently resort to rhetorical broadsides aimed at Trump’s numerous sins. Merkel told a campaign audience nearly a year ago that the United States could no longer be relied upon and that “it was time for Europe to take its fate in its own hands.” French President Emmanuel Macron recently took Trump to task on climate change in front of the U.S. Congress. But beyond these principled stands, they have done precious little to counter Trump.
&gt;
&gt;Europe’s initial plan was to rely on the so-called adults-in-the-room theory—the idea that the generals and Republican establishment figures who surrounded Trump in his first year would blunt his worst instincts. As the thinking went, Trump might commit any number of blunders on Twitter, but [U.S. policy toward Europe](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2018-01-18/trump-normal-foreign-policy-president) would remain as it had always been, and Europeans need only condemn the outrages. U.S. officials, when visiting Europe, encouraged this view by advising their European colleagues to pay no attention to the president of the United States and his tweets but rather to look at the policy. On issues such as Russia and NATO, the officials noted, U.S. policy followed its traditional course even as Trump challenged the orthodoxy on social media.
&gt;
&gt;At this point, however, most of the adults in the room have left and Trump seems to be asserting more of his own influence on U.S. foreign policy. France, Germany, and the United Kingdom engaged in an extended and coordinated charm offensive to keep Trump from leaving the JCPOA. They offered all manner of concessions to Trump’s position on the Iranian deal and even gave him a meeting with Queen Elizabeth II. But in the end, all of this flattery only signaled weakness in Trump’s eyes and he ignored their pleas.
&gt;
&gt;Still, Europeans do have options that could conceivably sustain the Iranian deal in the face of U.S. opposition. As French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has proposed, the [EU could enact blocking legislation](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2018-01-16/can-europe-save-iran-deal) to protect European companies from U.S. secondary sanctions and even compensate them for losses or fines. It could seek to set up a purely European finance house to oversee euro-dominated transactions with Iran to avoid the U.S. dollar and the U.S. financial system. And it could create a European agency capable of monitoring the activities of foreign firms, as the U.S. Treasury does, to enable them to retaliate against U.S. companies.
&gt;
&gt;A NEW BARGAIN
&gt;
&gt;It is unlikely, however, that Europe will pursue such tough measures. European companies and especially the banks don’t really want the protection. They don’t trust European governments to protect them, and they don’t want to risk getting entangled with U.S. authorities over a relatively small market such as Iran’s.
&gt;
&gt;Moreover, once the moral outrage fades, it is hard to imagine the European consensus holding in the face of concerted U.S. opposition. Poland, with its deep sense of reliance on the U.S. security guarantee, and the United Kingdom with its [Brexit-induced isolation](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-kingdom/2017-12-19/theresa-mays-brexit-dilemma) seem obvious candidates for defection. But there are many others—most every EU state still needs and wants the U.S. security guarantee.
&gt;
&gt;For the longer term, however, the transatlantic alliance needs to find a more balanced bargain if it is to thrive and serve the needs of both sides of the Atlantic. Otherwise, European frustration and U.S. indifference will eventually erode the partnership from within.
&gt;
&gt;Despite the constant call for increased European defense budgets on both sides of the Atlantic, more spending is only a small part of that new bargain. The more essential element is a recognition on the European side that on issues such as Iran, Europeans have interests that are distinct from those of the Americans and that they can protect them only by sticking together and driving a hard bargain with Washington. This doesn’t mean siding with Russia or China over the United States, but it does mean seeing the alliance in the same geopolitical terms that Washington does.
&gt;
&gt;As of now, however, there is very little sign of that shifting. Trump’s frightening volatility, his antialliance bluster, and his penchant for destroying sacrosanct international agreements have done much to bring Europeans together.

1648,"There’s a bit of circular logic in your comment. 

Trump and Brexit happened, in no small part, *because* they played on people’s already existing concerns about spending and immigration. 

Barack Obama and George Bush both at times pushed Europe to pay their 2% on NATO but they didn’t. But was that a concern of most Americans? NO. Consistently, most Americans care first about jobs, then healthcare, schools, retirement.. not NATO spending. Same thing goes for foreign spending, when asked, most Americans overestimate how much foreign aid the US gives, and they say they’re giving too much, but they never rank it as a priority. 

Therefore, it doesn’t make sense to suggest that this is all a materialization of the concerns that people have. Brexit and Trump happened, to a great deal, because campaigns put these particular issues front and center and pressed them because they’re issues that get people angry or scared which gets them most motivated to vote. 

So the question becomes, if these aren’t responses to existing concerns, but rather responses to manufactured or exaggerated problems - what’s the motivating factor? What does someone get out of this since it’s not a desire to help address existing problems?

Even though they portray themselves as an LGBT-friendly party, Mr. Rivera has said before that calling a union between two people from the same sex a ""marriage"" generates unnecessary tension and drama. (Not verbatim but I'm on mobile so can't look for much right now). The CIS barometer in January 2018 showed the voters of C's to be around 6.75 on a 0 (being left) to 10 (being right) scale and they have been showing a soft shift towards the right from their first appearances on the Spanish media (remember they were founded in 2005, so not entirely new). This responds to an actual shift of Spanish voters moving to the right side of the spectrum which C's has known how to handle pretty well.

Whenever they have had the opportunity they have sided with the PP, giving them support in whatever measure they have needed to pass (which is the only political power they have had so far), even when they could've sided with other left-wing parties to end with legislations that don't fit too much in their programme.

And now for a personal story (and opinion).

1822,"&gt;I think his demand of closing Incirlik, unless Gülen is extradited, will prove to be a useless one.  Gülen might not be a U.S. citizen, but I think the U.S. has refused to extradite him before. Ince must be well aware of his chances being very slim here.

He also knows this.Gülen is a sensitive issue for Turkey.Pretty much all of Turkey hate him for a very good reasons.Many Turks see that as US hosting a problematic Islamist who broke Turkish laws(i am not even talking about the coup.There are litterarly videos of him telling his supporters to infiltrate the state institutions which itself is a huge crime).He escaped to US in 90s when military began cracking down on Islamist.

US should extradite Gülen to Turkey if İnce wins but i am not sure if they would.Even if they don't they might close down some of his schools and İnce's goverment will have a much better pr compared to Erdoğan which will make those actions easier so something happening about that issue is very likely which is good for İnce.

And most importantly it is a good propaganda material for election(İnce himself also knows what will most likely happen).

&gt;So what will he do? Actually close down the base by December 24th? You say it is unlikely, which would mean that nothing would happen at all and this is all empty rhetoric.

&gt;I'm just trying to figure out what his angle is here.

I explained his angle.These don't mean ""we are going to do x"".It usually means ""we are unhappy about y to consider x so please understand"".

This particiluar promise itself will likely be forgotten after the election and İnce would likely start talks with US for exteridation which would make people kinda happy about this situation.

What happens if nothing comes out of those talks?Most likely cold relations and Turkey going more and more against US but again Turkey will not kick US out of İncirlik unless something very very big happens(For example after Operation Atilla US sanctioned Turkey hard and Turkey temp. closed those bases to US troops and only allowed NATO troops to be there.).

1884,"Geopolitics always operates around the concept of the need of a 'balance of power'. Great powers need to be more or less equal in strength, and if one becomes too strong other powers ally themselves against said stronger state. Pretty much every pre-WW1 conflict was based on this. Modern geopolitics isn't much different except its more covert and done through proxies instead of full scale war. 

So with that in mind, looking at this map shows that Russia would've become too strong, especially with a non-existence Germany. Even before 1871 you had Prussia as a bulwark, but in this map its been reduced to very little. Its not inconcievable that more than one of the German successor states (and Austro-Hungarian ones) could've fallen under Russian sphere of influence, bringing Russian expansion at its westernmost point in history. Also the former German territory annexed by Russia here was rich in coal and industry. 

In addition, with a Russian-friendly state (Bulgaria), controlling the Dardanelles Russia would likely have more access to the Mediterranean than ever before, something other Great Powers would be concerned about.

Catalonia doesn't want to secede because of Rajoy, although he's basically the reason why we don't have our Estatut (he started the signatories thing) which ended up starting the pro-independence process. The general discontent comes before him (Zapatetro totally lying about respecting the Estatut, etc.).

2029,"[Politeness Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politeness_theory)


Edit: The translated, condensed version of Politeness Theory is:

Among strangers, humans value two things; privacy and status. Most rudeness is something that hurts another's status ( positive face) eg ""you're a stupid ugly person, Becky"". However, in a lot of countries privacy/freedom (negative face) is also heavily valued. Speaking to some rando on the street is effectively forcing them to be polite to you aka not being status-rude by refusing to respond. This is an invasion of privacy. 

Breaking protocol on privacy (negative face) can lead to a response of broken protocol on status (positive face). So stopping in front of a stranger and demanding some of their time

""Hello!"" *direct eye contact*

may lead to the response

There were several people on standby so someone was going to sit there whether she realized it or not and the last person who got on the bus was this massive, overweight disgusting guy whose only seat option was with this girl. The look on her face was priceless. I've never experienced anything more satisfying. She was speechless when he first asked her to move.

As for the exact layout of the land, whether the exact 67' borders or modified borders that's subject to negotiations. This is also the exact position of most of the international community including the UN. If an Israeli government would think, and could show, that it was in our best interests to return the annexed territories I would have no issue with that. Generally I think that Israel should negotiate with the view of maintaining those territories. Certainly the Golan heights and the Judean hills for strategic purposes, I feel considerably less strongly about East Jerusalem outside of a few Jewish neighborhoods. 

My position regarding negotiations though and how I think the final agreement should look like is irrelevant. I was not the person to invoke international law and I would generally not to do so for exactly the reason you stated above, I do not take international law so seriously, it is used as justification by powerful nations to impose their will on weaker nations, it is rarely applied equally or fairly and will arguably never be.

&gt;Your saying about food and safety in workplace was living standard either. USSR simply had no resources to provide either. So my argument about living standards is as good as yours.

I didn't give an agrument about food and safety standards in the USSR i gave facts, it is a fact that millions died in famines in the USSR and that work standards were horrific.


&gt;One of the main flows of democratic system is precisely that. Anybody, regardless of their skills, has equal say. Which allows populists to get ellected. That's a feature of democracy, not an issue.

Yes and that is also a feature in the a socialist workplace, this was nowhere to be found in the USSR

 


&gt;If wage can differ according to performance, why say in a company couldn't differ? The more valuable and skilled you're, the more say you got. Why should line workers, who have no clue about management and don't know wider picture, have same say as managers? Especially if they got in for nothing and if they run a company to the ground, they could just get into another company for nothing.

You have equal say because that is a rule built up in the system, just like how in western democracy earning more doesn't give you more voting power in elections.

&gt;Pension is good example why state is kinda needed. Just stashing money in a sock isn't a wise idea. Without a state, it's hard to have redistribution (pensioners get what workers pay in ponzi scheme style) system.

2223,"&gt; This is independent of that. I was making fun of your unsound argumentation. 

Sure, if you remove the parts you don't like, you can do whatever you want to my argumentation.

&gt; ""The fact that F is evidence that L."" is equivalent of writing ""F=&gt;L"" (F causes L) and from that follows ""!L =&gt; !F"" which you can rewrite back to ""if there is no looking then there are no fuckups"", which is my joke

No. Just no.

Your logic is sound. The manipulation you apply to the F proposition is not.

!L =&gt; !F actually means, by your own definitions of L and F, that ""if there is no one looking then YOU DON'T GET TO SEE FUCKUPS"" and __NOT__ that _there are no fuckups_. Do you have a problem with 'if there is no one looking then no one gets to see fuckups'? (including you, which by the implicant, is also not looking)

I have argued a million times that I'VE NEVER IMPLIED NOR I'VE EVER SAID ANYTHING THAT IMPLIES THAT THERE ARE NO FUCKUPS. I am very familiar (and in fact, I've quoted it) with the rule that testing reveals the presence of bugs, not the absence of it. 

And considering I've even mentioned the rule, showing I'm familiar with it, why do you still inanely try to rephrase what I'm saying in order to reduce my arguments to it? Even resorting to burde manipulations?

&gt; But nobody bothers, demonstrably. 

Demonstrably with what? With more examples of PEOPLE ACTUALLY CARING ENOUGH TO BE FINDING BUGS BY LOOKING AT THE SOURCE CODE?

&gt; Yes, for any epsilon. 

POSITIVE epsilon.

&gt; It implies my counter to ""which is already an order of magnitude better than the alternative"" was invalid because you count only when there is non-proprietary firmware. 

No. Conveniently again, you forgot the first part: _The fuckup discovery chances are greatly increased if you have the source_. This is what implies that the open source alternative is OBJECTIVELY better. Remember my point? I've repeated it at least TWICE per message so far. 

The ""besides"" part indicates AN ASIDE REMARK. A REMARK that YOU are trying to put in the argument. Even introducing the concept of ""open source firmware"" which I've never mentioned nor I'm even sure if exists in practice.

&gt; Which is classics no true scotsman fallacy.

Actually, IT IS NOT. Because it missing the ""ad hoc"" classifier (aka the ""muddy"" definition of what is a true Scotsman). Or do you think that open source versus closed source is an ""ad hoc"" definition? That you can blame closed source software for problems you find in open source software (or viceversa), and everyone who contradicts with you is going to be incurring a ""No true Scotsman"" fallacy? Seriously?

Go back to school and review your first order logic. Wikipedia is not going to cut it.

No presidential elections though.

&gt; And what do you do if your king gives birth to a bad son?

The king giving birth to a son is something I am confident will never happen.

Joking aside, the crown prince/princess is raised to be a king/queen all their life. It is possible there is someone unsuitable, but it is unlikely and there is a good chance they would abdicate (as shown by the example of Edward VIII in the UK). Moreover, their powers are sufficiently restricted these days that they are unlikely to do harm.

2379,"&gt; Uh, what? The radical minority inside the Greek Cypriots cooperated with the Greek Army and went with a coup d'état and got invaded. That's a whole different story than what have happened in the '63 and until the coup. Are you sure you know things you're talking about?

The Greek government illegally amended the constitution and proceeded to slowly transform the country into typical ethnostate lines by disenfranchising Turkish Cypriots.

&gt; Taksim was long dead by the '60. Greece pulling out something was the issue that made Turkey intervene anyway, and not sure what you're referring to with couldn't stopping Greece from pulling all that nonsense. You mean the coup? It had failed within days anyway.

Makarios conspired with Greece and even though he disagreed at times (particularly with the junta) he was squarely in their camp. Taksim sure as shit wasn't dead as it continued as a reactionary movement up to the invasion. 1963 is the time when Turkey believe the Cypriot government to have breached the agreement, it's when Turkey started making proper plans for invasion and got more involved with Turkish Cypriot political issues.

&gt; They've agreed on the veto rights on related subjects.

No subjects forthcoming. All you do is repeat yourself.

&gt; Turkish Cypriots aren't asking for more anyway, we wanted those rights for not losing our rights and for stopping the enosis. We've ever asked for an 'equal say', but we were happy with having the 1/4 of the say hence our quotas.

You seem to have missed the point. Turkish Cypriots have always campaigned for either very broad autonomy for self-rule or the ability to gridlock the country's political system (like with a proper veto) to guarantee decisions would be taken with consensus and the system couldn't be monopolized by the Greeks. This remains TRNC policy and afaik most parties in TRNC parliament continue to endorse it. So no, they're asking for plenty more. If you personally aren't, stop projecting.

&gt; In future, things are going to be the same on that subject.

I won't take your word for it, considering you aren't a soothsayer.

&gt; Mate, are you aware that we're talking about the times when Greeks and Turks were mass massacring each other, and Ottomans hadn't had that much power in here, and than left all the power to the Brits. Unlike you assume, things went shit when the overlord tightened the grip. Are you sure you do know the history of this very island?

The Ottomans had power enough, like being able to conscript. It's just that the island came under the influence of the respective nationalist struggles late. Doesn't change the fact that it did. Turkish and Greek Cypriots didn't start hating each other because of the Brits, you need to dial down the revisionism.

&gt; Turkey doesn't let it to be a consensus without their interests being fulfilled.

The two sides didn't reach an agreement even without Turkey being at the table.

Interestingly our Nordic neighbor Norway has one of the largest poverty gender gaps to women’s disadvantage.

FWIW, poverty among over 64-year-old women is far more common almost everywhere in Europe. The main reason here being the fact that women’s average pensions are lower than men’s due to shorter careers. Also, women tend to live longer which increases their risk of being widowed and coping on one source of income (poverty rates are calculated based on household income).

2397,"37% of Spaniards believe that abolishing the monarchy would be the best for the country, according to the latest survey published by Ipsos Global Advisor. The study, carried out in 28 countries around the world and which has interviewed more than 20,000 people worldwide, places the Spanish monarchy as the one that receives less support from its citizens within Europe.

This means that almost 2 out of 5 Spaniards believe that abolishing the monarchical regime would be positive to improve the future of our country, compared to 24% of the population that believes that closing the Royal House would have a negative effect.

The situation contrasts radically with the situation of other European monarchies, such as the British, as only 15% of the inhabitants of the United Kingdom believe that the end of the reign of Elizabeth II would be positive. Worldwide, the Japanese Imperial Family is the one that best stops, since it has 96% support from its citizens.

Vicente Castellanos, Director of Public Affairs of IPSOS Spain, points out that ""the support to the monarchy in Spain is the majority, but the percentage of those who perceive it as dispensable is equally important."" On the other hand, he points out that the survey data ""mark a generational fracture, where younger generations claim their right to decide regardless of their political ideology. ""

Castellanos makes reference in his statements to the data thrown by the last Omnibus, an independent study conducted by IPSOS Spain last April, where more than half of the respondents, 52%, are in favor of holding a referendum on the possibility of establishing a republic instead of a monarchy. Within this sector, young people are most in favor of a consultation. Specifically, 63% of Spaniards aged between 25 and 34 want to vote to decide democratically whether to keep King Philip VI in office or not.

This fracture becomes even more evident when analyzing the voting intentions of the more than 1,000 participants in this survey, since left-wing voters are much more likely to hold a referendum than the right-wing voters. While 86% of Podemos voters support the encouragement of a popular referendum, in the case of Popular Party voters the data goes the other way, since only 25% of them are in favor of the referendum. However, for Castellanos the opinion on the monarchy ""is shown more as a generational issue than political ideology, although this power or mitigate depending on the cases the extreme opinions.""",Catalan Republic,/r/europe/comments/8k1t28/the_spanish_monarchy_is_the_european_monarchy/dz47rw1/,Toc_a_Somaten,1526535329

2513,"&gt; I've had professors say this seriously. There's an argument to be had.

Yea, there is, because it's no totally off. You could make that claim and wouldn't have to go out of your way to find historical evidence to support it somewhere. 

You know, one of the problems with German historians in the 19^th and early 20^th century was that while they were formidable researchers when it came to sources from the middle ages (they developed medieval studies as an academic discipline in the process), they had a proclivity to rifle through these sources from the vantage point of the recently founded German nation state and work backwards from there. 

They ended up judging medieval kings and emperors on whether or not they were helpful in this regard -- as if it were the task of a medieval lord, living in a feudal society, to do everything he can to bring about a nation state a thousand years later. True to their mission, they were highly critical of the Carolingians and the Plantagenêts (for putting ""family over country"", as if that somehow weren't exactly what feudalism was all about), but quite fond of the Capetians (because they somehow knew exactly what to do so that 800 years later, a strong, centralised France could come out of it), the Ottonians and the Salians.

And of course they ""found evidence"" that the German-French enmity was indeed ""hereditary"" and the gargantuan conflict arising from it completely unavoidable. And, as you will no doubt have guessed by now, it all started with Charlemagne and his sons playing *A Game of Thrones*.

&gt; Hell, no need to stop there. We can jump aaaalllll the way back to the time of the Romans

You can get those all across the country, but Amsterdam has the reputation for it, so people go there. These things attract a certain type of tourist. We do have the history and culture tourists as well. But many people do come to Amsterdam thinking it's the European Las Vegas, and they treat it as such. Because you can do those things here must surely mean the locals are fine with public smoking, public drunkness and generally 'party' behavior on a regular tuesday afternoon, right? No, actually they just want to get on with their lives and not be bothered by you. [I mean seriously](https://twitter.com/MaartenNauw/status/990229275445026816).

Into touristy restaurants, tourist sites and hotels? That's the three things every tourists spends money on. Local shops often aren't interesting for tourists. And as a landlord, why rent out your place to a bookstore if you could have one of the many fantastic Nutalla themed stores that pay more rent (because that makes sense since we're definitely Italian and surely eat more Nutella than other European countries (we don't!)). Duplicate this process, and your main street will be full of shitty fast-food and touristy shops. A flower market which only sells seeds and packaged bulbs, a cheese store that only sells tiny overpriced portions of air-sealed cheese.  Don't even think you will be able to order something in Dutch there.    

Since airbnb came along, rental prices have gone up. Why? Because the property has increased in value because it's ""rentable for extra income"". Sure is fun to have groups of young tourists staying next door or upstairs and behaving like assholes and making tons of noise in the night.   

Then there's the issue of space. There isn't a whole lot in this old city. Big tour groups take up a lot of room. We've had to close some areas (literally) because it became dangerously overcrowded. Sometimes they [block up](https://twitter.com/schlijper/status/888768871695626240) sidewalks and bike paths.

Hm. While it isn't wrong, it's right only in a way that makes the whole argument go stale. Attributing *Prussian* (the Southern German states had nigh quarrel with the French, as they were in fact their allies most of the time) francophobia to Bonaparte is like saying banks are the reason they're robbed (they're not; lack of money is). 

By the same token, you could say Charlemagne was the reason for all the horrors between the French and the Germans.

2610,"&gt; Do you notice your own Dutch accent when speaking English?   

Yes. But it's not like I do it because I'm 'lazy'. If you want to change your accent, you have to train it.   

&gt; what do you think of it?    

I personally don't mind it, as long as the pronunciation is correct. There's a difference between accent and pronunciation. Most Dutch people are perfectionists and hate anything that isn't a 'good' (American/British) accent. So we end up with people who pretend to sound like the Queen, and meanwhile not sounding natural at all and coming across as annoying smarty-pants.

&gt;  And do you find it annoying when so many ppl try to imitate/mock your accent?

They rarely do. Compared to other well-known language speakers (Spanish, French, German) the accents are often more sublte. I guess this is because Dutch has quite a wide arrange of sounds. And if they do try to mock, they are English. And if they do mock, they do a terrible job at it.

If they see the divine as primarily loving and forgiving the followers will try to emulate that. In my opinion, the loving and forgiving interpretation is more correct for at least my own religion. But loads of my fellow believers see our god as someone who desires obedience before love.

The important thing is that we try to make a paradise here on earth for eachother rather than scramble and fight to make our own individual ones. But that will only be possible with a love for all people. I hope that one day all people will see their fellow people as their family, and that they will choose to be patient and open to the brothers and sisters they disagree with.

2693,"&gt; The Spanish reacted badly in Catalonia. What's more, it was unnecessary. They should have allowed the vote, allowed the declaration of independence, and simply ignored it.

Correct me if I've got the wrong impression here, but it sounds to me as though that would be the plan of choice concerning Scotland as well: Have them vote on it (you've said something to this effect above) and either trust that they will vote against independence, as they did before, or that Westminster will be able to just wait them out. 

Two things come to mind: 

It would seem to me to be a highly risky bet to bank on the polls. Just look at what happend those last two years. Until very recently, the Anglosphere had a reputation for doing the right, the *rational* thing in the end. I hit the hay on 23 June 2016 knowing full well that the UK would stay in the EU because remain was in the lead. After I woke up next morning and turned on the telly, I had my coffee freeze in the mug. Scarcely half a year later, the same thing happened with the elections in the United States. I fell asleep with president Hillary Clinton only to find myself wake up in the arms of Donald Trump. 

Brits and Americans, of all people, have been responsible for the biggest upsets in our recent Western statecraft. Why should anyone trust that it won't happen again, especially with such emotive an issue like Scottish independence at stake? 

Secondly, wouldn't it be problematic (to say the least) if you were to ignore a non-binding referendum in Scotland after having honoured an equally non-binding referendum on Brexit? Although legally possible, wouldn't that require a tremendous amount of political capital to be spent, and would a May government already under pressure from multiple fronts, both foreign and domestic, even be able to muster it in the first place?",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8jmyti/scottish_parliament_decisively_rejects_eu/dz3ovei/,ColourFox,1526513379

Extreme poverty and poverty are both at historical lows and dropping, but that doesn't matter I guess. Genocide and war definately did not exists before capitalism either. What do socialist (not soc-dem) ruled countries bring to the table instead ? Mostly mass impoverishment.

2763,"Reload a moment: 

You was pointing at devalutation as a big problem, I made the exemple of italian experience *between 1950 and 1980*: big inflation and great social-economic achievements. 

You posted a chart that show how **between 1950 and 1980** debt raised only from 25% to 55%. The boom has been under the EMS rules (= no more free devalutation): 55% to 120% in 15 years.

&gt; so your point is? 

My point is that actual economic architecture of UE has been by far too punitive for countries that had a model of growth not compatible with how EMS has been implemented. We had lost too much because of that and something must be changed, there's no magical italian ""reform"" that could change things. Following all european imposed crazy reforms we had only gone worst, and trying to go ahead paying interests on 130% debt without a lender of last resort, without public investiments, reducing year by year the welfare, with no inflation, will keep our country in decline forever. 

Quitting the euro could be a disaster for us, but it's unfair and unacceptable to stay at those conditions. People will become more and more angry, and soon or later the situation will explode. Europe must understand that if it don't reform itself now the italian debt bubble will blow up tomorrow, if it's not this time with lega&amp;M5S it will be the next time. And it will be a disaster for everybody in europe, not only for us. It's not like Greece, italian size is ten times bigger, the chain effect would be huge.

&gt; surely the whole point of the eu was to destroy italy

Not the whole point, but the main point on economic structural choices has been the stop of italian erosion of german export.

&gt; italian failures can't possibly have been the result of the corruption and instability that has dominated all italian govs...

Italian corruption in the last 25 years is in a good share a (self) narrated story, in fact indices show how it's in the EU average. Political instability it's not directly linked to low growth, Spain and Germany in the last years had shown it once again. 

Sure, we had Berlusconi, we have a huge historical problem with the south, a lot of money (expecially in the 80s) could had been expended better. But the main frame of our problems has been to tie our economy at the worst model possible for its nature. Going from very high interests to zero interests with almost no time graduation and with zero mediation has been a disaster.

2830,"This was a late reply. I’ll attempt to respond in order and hope my battery lasts. 

1- I think you are misconstruing (not purposefully) my point. Any governmental body inevitably feels the need to justify its existence and start looking at what it can do. Mandates or not the fact it exists means it feels the need to be useful and often enough dip toes in where they would be best left alone. It’s a simple point about the nature of governments, not the EU specifically. 

2- these aren’t, by and large, general insurance products by rather life assurance savings products. Their nature across different markets is hugely different and though they go by the same name an annuity in say France is pretty much entirely different than an annuity in the UK. Solvency 2 tries to provide regulatory requirements along similar lines to all of the myriad of products in play across the EU but they just aren’t analogous enough to allow this to happen meaning there are some really bodged conditions and opt outs simply to make it work at all. See matching premiums if you’re interested in it. 

As I said though, leave it 20-50 years and market forces would have brought it together naturally to a point where it wouldn’t have mattered. 

Also to be clear, it is not consumer protection legislation. It is prudential requirements legislation but the reality is that because we are in fact talking about different products we end up with different requirements, just badly squeezed into a common framework leaving us with the worst of both worlds. 

3. I think it’s unfair to categorise all of the leave campaign as just lies. The impact of mass migration on the UK is very real and to claim that the influx of people from Poland into various communities hasn’t had an effect is a lie in its own right. Now I’m now suggesting that Brexit is a good thing on that basis (I’m a remainer) but for too long politicians have opted for ignoring these issues and it has bitten them. The leave campaign played on this base reality and threw populist and down right racist lies on top but without that base it wouldn’t have gained traction. 

As for remain not lying. I don’t think it did anything overtly deceitful like leave did but project fear is a case in point of presentation mattering. Worst case analysis was presented as fact. 2 years after the campaign has if anything proven this point, he world hasn’t collapsed. 

Ps- please don’t get me wrong, Leave was a sham and I would prefer to be staying but to suggest he EU is all sweetness and light is to overlook its considerable deficiencies and impacts on national sovereignty.

2832,"&gt;Turks that should be resettled back are the illegal settlers from Turkey.

There are thousands of people that were born from these ""illegal settlers"". Let´s assume that the average dude was 30 when settled to Cyprus: We are talking about people that are +70 years old. This is beyond resonable. There is also the question about the people that were born there. 

&gt;You don't need to demonise Turkey or anything to see that Turkey isn't the best thing for the island.

Turkey didn´t go there to be the best in the first place. The war broke out due to fights and persecution. 

&gt; and we're getting into the point that we are becoming a minority in the face of the settlers

What?

&gt;what Turkey does is both bad for the island in general

Turkey is basically keping you guys alive. I have a hard time seeing this as ""bad"". The main issue for north cyprus is that it has no international recognizition, which is why no investment or trade is happening there. 

Now to the main issue: If you guys want Turkey to just screw off without leaving anything and if you guys face oppression, then what? ""You fucked it up!""? What then? Then there will be a demand for a turkish intervention. 

&gt;Turkish Cypriots and Turkish settlers are two different groups at the end.

People that are born there are turkish cypriots. To begin with, there were not many turkish cypriots anyways. 

&gt;Turkey has its own military and economic interests, and those aren't for protecting the Turkish Cypriots but for protecting their own gains.

What did Turkey gain out of the invasion of Cyprus? Literally nothing. 

&gt; but just maybe a protection for us,

This is what I wrote. 

&gt;Because they're illegal settlers?

I am talking about people that were born there. 

&gt;There are two main sides in here, Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, while Turkey is the foreign player. Of course, if Turkey disturbs things for the sake of its own gains and interests, it's not going to be seen in a positive light.

I will repeat myself: Let´s assume Turkey screws off from that place entirely without leaving any presence or influence. Let´s say turks are getting oppressed again. Then what? Can YOU take this responsibility? Can YOU solve this issue out? What will happen then? There will be a cry for turkish support. This is the issue here.

2885,"&gt; You’re making it sound like Albanians introduced cocaine to The Netherlands and getting rid of Albanians would remove cocaine from the streets. 

Right. You might want to have a look at Albania's use of cocaine: [UNODC Statistics Online](https://data.unodc.org/): Drug indicators - Drug Use and Health Consequences - Cocaine, select ""Europe"" as region. Apparently they are Europe's biggest users.

&gt; The problem are not these people. The problem are your own people and the demand for these drugs.

No, the problem is that our port is excellent to send cocaine to that is destined for the Northern, Western and to some extent Central European market.

&gt; Also imposing VISAs would only hurt the normal law-abidding people who travel as tourists. 

Maybe export less crime and our police might change their opinion on removing visa-free access. 

The fact is, not having easy access to most of Europe is an obstacle for criminals, you should know. Here is an example of pickpockets by nationality in The Netherlands before and after the 2007 accession:

Nationality | 2005 | 2007 | 2009 | 2011 | 2013
---|---|---|---|---|---
Bulgarian  (total) | 40 | 70 | 160 | 150 | 300
Bulgarian (%) | 3.7% | 8% | 12,7% | 9,9% | 14,6%
Romanian (total) | 30 | 100 | 290 | 400 | 800
Romanian (%) | 2,8% | 11,5% | 23% | 26,3% | 39%
Total | 1090 | 870 | 1260 | 1520 | 2050

Now obviously 14,6% of our population in 2013 didn't have a Bulgarian origin, so you can see that not having an open border did work.

2907,"&gt; When you say that the fact that there are fuckups indicates people are looking at code implies that fuckups can't be indicated by other things

This would make sense if we ignore that all examples mentioned so far come from people reading at the code. 

&gt; Because we can't look at code of Windows then according to you we shouldn't see fuckups

No. But you will see much fewer fuckups. 

&gt; therefore there is no reason to move to Linux if there are no fuckups on Windows.

And now comes a completely wrong conclusion. Testing reveals the presence of bugs, NOT the absence of bugs. EVEN if you never saw a single bug in Windows that says nothing about any ""reason to move"".

In fact, the _only_ reason I've potentially given to move to somewhere other than Windows is because open source _allows_ the possibility for external code review, and I've explicitly mentioned several times that I'm NOT saying that it is more fuckup free.

&gt; But they didn't read it when they needed and ought to 

What is this?

&gt; they didn't read it for years and statistically we know there are many more fuckups in code we both use because nobody gives a flying fuck 

Again, your own examples prove you wrong. Looks like people give a fuck and keep finding bug after bug. 

And any way, even if your proposition was true, the point is that since third party reviews are _impossible_ on propietary software, the situation is _objectively_ worse. 

&gt; So Linux is never at fault.

The ""no"" comes from the part where you try to argue that I said ""Then you changed to magnitude better on foss firmware. "". Where the fuck did I say that?

I’m arguing that PKK/YPG do not represent all Kurds and thus Turkey isn’t at war with Kurds in general but with several groups that happen to be predominantly Kurdish but do not represent the vast majority of Kurdish population or their views. PKK don’t just want autonomous Kurdish state, they an autonomous Kurdish state with a very specific political model based on a specific ideology that overwhelming majority of Kurds don’t agree with.

Yes, Erdo is a tyrant, yes, Turkish state has ignored and opressed Kurds for a long time, but that doesn’t change what PKK/YPG and other militias allied with them are: fanatical terrorists that not only hurt the states they are fighting against, but the Kurdish people too.

Look at this from the perspective of Kurds living in Turkey’s East: while the rest of the country is full of tourists nobody comes to the Kurdish areas because of all the fighting going on there. While the rest of Turkish cities continue to grow and evolve Kurdish areas remain shot up and semi-destroyed because of the war. There is no contribution to the local economy from the outside because nobody comes there, small business owners can’t open their shops or earn any money, people are afraid to send their children to school, Kurdish civilians often get caught up in crossfires and IED explosions (remember, the fighting goes in predominantly Kurdish areas, not Turkish ones, and the civilians dying there aren’t Turks, they’re Kurds). Attempts at bringing supplies there or at constructing new neighborhoods are constantly sabotaged by Turkish militias that think they’re clever for doing so cause they’re sabotaging the Turkish economy without realising they’re sabotaging any development withit their own region. Do you think an average Kurds caught in the middle of this shitstorm care about whatever utopia PKK envisions for them or do they just want this Hell to stop so they could move on with their lives?

In 2004, right after the terrorist attacks (last time PP almost lost Madrid) the city voted PP by 6% but the region only by 1% 

The only reason Carmena is mayor while PP rules the region is because the election was basically a coin flip.

3029,"Didn't you read the article? That revolution was about *East Germany*, which at the time was an authoritarian regime. And it folded to unarmed protestors.

You also seem to have misread the next part of my post -- I specifically pointed out that NATO is considered unreliable myself, and how Europe is planning to move on from this transatlantic dependence on the US.

&gt; It's crazy that you see Europe as coming to democracy peacefully.

Please look back, that's not what I said.

But to better exemplify based on the example you have chosen: the French citizenry back then didn't have guns, either. They were acquired in the hour of need, first by stealing muskets and cannons stored in [Les Invalides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Invalides), then using those to [storm the Bastille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storming_of_the_Bastille) and raid its armories to equip themselves further. Furthermore, the revolution as a whole would have likely faltered, were it not for the support of the [French Guards regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardes_Fran%C3%A7aises), which had joined the revolutionaries and led the Storming of the Bastille.

Please look back and analyse history carefully. Not even the US gained their independence by random citizens stockpiling guns for personal use, but by well-equipped and trained local and allied military forces joining the cause.

A popular revolution stands or falls by the support of the government's military forces.

&gt; But the French since the French revolution had a culture of civilian-soldiers that required them to have guns.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_France

Even if we look back at history, France actually had pretty strict gun laws before WW2 (specifically, 1938), in large part because the government at the time feared the threat of armed communist revolutionaries. If you are wondering where the resistance fighters then got their guns from to fight the Germans with, the answer will probably come by itself once you look at *what* types of guns they used, or more specifically in what countries they were produced in. The [FP-45 Liberator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FP-45_Liberator) is of particular interest in this regard, as its explicit purpose was to provide resistance fighters with a stopgap measure to kill a Nazi soldier, then steal his weapons and then just use those.

&gt; It's because the French had guns. Poor villagers don't have guns.

When you wrote this, did it not occur to you that the French revolutionaries weren't exactly rich, either? Do you think the Kurds purchased their own guns and have been living with them at times they did not need them? Or could their current capability have anything to do with having received weapons and vehicles from the US?

&gt; And you admit that guns are needed to fight for freedom, but you get tied up in this notion that a gun will appear when freedom calls.

Yes, because as history shows, this has been the case.

How many revolutions do you know where the citizenry had been swimming in guns during peacetime? Can you list even one or two?",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8ilwq9/eurovision_terminates_contract_with_chinese/dz31ngl/,akashisenpai,1526492038

&gt; The US is growing at a much faster rate. China's middle class is nearing 400 million, India is uplifting people out of poverty. It's a numbers game.

Even by the ""best"" US growth rate estimation its less then 1% faster. By most 2018 estimations its barely different with somewhere between 1% and 0,1% ahead for one of them. And if its a numbers game, then the EU will end up ahead given that its almost got a 200 million higher population (140 without UK). As for India and China, sure they are growing. Which will make especially India with its smaller restrictions a nice market for the EU and the EU itself keeps growing its economy.

&gt; If it's prohibitively expensive to operate in a market...

Damn thats economy for true pro's. If you cant make money somewhere, you dont sell. Hot damn. 

Here is another one. If you get restricted as fuck in your emerging market, you cant amazon and sell shit and get Alibaba'ed instead. 

&gt; As of now - yes, Europe is valuable enough...

The worlds second biggest consumer market, more then twice as big then China, is good enough, hear, hear.

&gt; but between dwindling population and substandard growth...

Which is literally a global problem, especially in developed nations, and about to fuck the developing ones like India and China twice as bad, just throwing in there the one child policy that made sure that theyll get a nice generation gap as fitting to a(n emerging) first world nation, and both India and China have a beautiful imbalance between males and females, growing worse, and so do its effects. As for other nations, again the US isnt far behind, and Japan way ahead. So lets leave the demographics out of this.

As for substandard growth, thats as established thats a load of utter shit, and quite some of the western nations have a gdp growth roughly equal or ahead of the US. http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2014/528775/IPOL_ATA(2014)528775_EN.pdf

Fine, but communists dont have ""representation (and power)"" because people dont want them to be their representatives, it has nothing to do with ""special treatment"".

I disagree. Communist are bad, nazis are bad. I dont think there is any point in arguing which side is ""better"" since they are both evil.

Yes, it literally is a punishment, From what I remember of the incident, all he did was burn the puppet, he didnt verbally incite to violence or anything like that.

3141,"*Influential members call for more action on crime, institutional reform and bilateral disputes*

The European Commission’s drive to bring six western Balkan states into the EU faces resistance from influential members seeking more action to tackle crime, institutional reform and bilateral disputes.

France, the Netherlands and Germany are among EU states wanting to impose tougher demands before agreeing to Brussels’ proposal to open accession talks with Albania and Macedonia.

Their concerns have emerged ahead of an EU-western Balkans summit in Sofia on Thursday aimed at improving relations. EU leaders will be asked to decide next month on whether to start accession talks as the commission has recommended.

One sceptical EU member state diplomat said talks on joining seemed “premature”, given that reforms to improve graft and tackle governance had further to go. Another said the commission appeared to be “running a bit ahead of the music” on enlargement and risked stoking Eurosceptic scaremongering about crime and immigration ahead of European elections next year.

“We have got concerns pretty much across the board when it comes to the rule of law, corruption and state capture,” he said of Albania and Macedonia. “That carrot [of membership] is still there. But they have to do the work.”

A third diplomat said: “Progress has been good, but there are criminal networks still operating. If you are working in an interior ministry in an EU member state, this will make you shiver.”

The reservations highlight a dilemma for the EU, which sees the five states of the former Yugoslavia, along with Albania, as essential to its security, management of migration and geopolitical tussle with Russia. Some states, particularly newer EU members, strongly support further enlargement. 

The commission wants the Sofia summit to help open a path to some of the six western Balkan countries to join the EU by an indicative — and ambitious — date of 2025. Montenegro has been in accession talks since 2012 and Serbia since 2014. 

But Marko Kmezic, a senior researcher at the Centre for Southeast European Studies at the University of Graz, branded the summit a “good family photo opportunity” and said significant progress towards accession required “more time and honest engagement” by both sides. 

“Instead of the region actually catching up with the EU in terms of democracy and economic convergence, we see [it] either stagnating over the past decade or even slowly bogging down,” Mr Kmezic said, pointing to rising authoritarianism in some western Balkan states. “We observe that the EU is actually more interested in other things — keeping stability in the region and preventing external influences, be it Russia, the Gulf [countries] or China.” 

EU members largely accept the logic of having close ties to a region crucial to the bloc’s security. The shutdown of the western Balkans migration route eased Europe’s 2015-16 migration crisis while the area’s location as a gateway to surrounding EU countries has drawn interest from powers including China.

Enlargement would also show the EU’s vitality if the UK becomes the first country to leave the bloc, as it is scheduled to do next year. 

But some EU members say they still need more evidence of the effectiveness of reforms touted by leaders such as Edi Rama, Albania’s prime minister, who says his country is rooting out corruption in the judiciary and tackling criminal networks.

European diplomats say France is a leading sceptic on Balkans enlargement. On the day the commission proposed starting accession talks with Albania and Macedonia, President Emmanuel Macron said the EU needed to reform its internal governance before adding members. Mr Rama met Mr Macron in Paris this week. 

Balkan territorial disputes are another reason for EU wariness. Brussels has made settling these a strict condition of joining, after seeing the destabilising influence of the contested border between Slovenia and Croatia — the most recent entrant to the EU, in 2013.

Greece, an EU member, is technically still in second world war era hostilities with Albania. Athens also refuses to accept Macedonia’s right to use the name, also that of a Greek region. Both disagreements have moved closer to resolution and are EU priorities, with the prime ministers of Greece and Macedonia due to meet on the sidelines of the summit.

A further problem is that five EU members do not recognise Kosovo, largely because of concerns over how it seceded from Serbia. Among them is Spain, where the issue has become even more sensitive given Catalonia’s recent thwarted drive for independence. Mariano Rajoy, Spain’s prime minister, will not attend the summit.

It will be 15 years next month since EU members’ clear declaration that “the future of the Balkans is within the European Union”. Now the pre-summit letter to the bloc’s leaders from Donald Tusk, Europe Council president, talks only of a “European perspective” for the region — and argues the EU is the only partner that genuinely cares about its stability and will not treat it like a “geopolitical game of chess”.

Yeah sure. It's Belgium's fault the Spanish Supreme Court doesn't know how to properly issue an European Arrest Warrant.

&gt; The lawyer says that, while this is a big win that exposes how sloppy the Spanish justice system is, they'd have prefered for this defect of form to not exist, as they were confident in that the charges wouldn't have proceeded anyway —which would have made for a bigger exposure of the political prosecution they denounce.

Totally agree. And I'm gonna assume the Spanish Supreme Court did this in purpose. It's the most important Court in Spain in one of the most important cases for Spain.

3229,"maybe a bit too dramatic headline for a well written piece that tried to cover perspectives of all sides

what was not mentioned there (although author probably is well aware of that just chose not to include it) is that Germany 3 has so much more democratic ways to solve the EU puzzle compared to Germany 1 &amp; 2, there's no reason why Germans should be afraid to lead (not rule) even though I understand their careful approach

what should be also pointed out is one of the articles author referred to, namely this one - 

http://glineq.blogspot.de/2017/12/democracy-of-convenience-not-of-choice.html

as someone who mentioned this multiple times, I appreciate that Milanovic (former lead economist in the World Bank) also understands that citizens of CE &amp; EE states are on the verge of going full EU or slide into semi-authoritarian regimes which they consider to be a price worth paying to keep what they got in 1989

that's why I think Germans are careful here - they know that keeping CE &amp; EE doing whatever it wants would result in continuous support of populist tendencies (and spreading of state/read EU/sponsored corruption) and same results would be achieved by pushing on them too much

similarly, citizens are in a similar state - population too fragile to fully embrace migration (in a way WE is able to embrace it) and too cautious about losing what they gained in 1989 and it is, therefore, understandable in a certain way that keeping homogeneous population many consider to be a priority

fully injecting same principles would be a disaster, I ask for patience from WE with us, it's been 14 years since we've joined and although it led to many problems, many other issues were solved and careful approach with small doses so we have time to evolve &amp; adapt is a way to go",Slovakia,/r/europe/comments/8juomh/the_fall_of_the_german_empire/dz2lb7z/,Bisclavert,1526477575

3237,"&gt; Meh... Russia already has its next generation MBT, IFV, APC, AA, jets, ships and ICBM's either in production or getting ready to enter production.

yea thats what their news channels are saying......look at their actual production numbers instead of what the propaganda says. 

They currently have placed orders for just 100 Armata tanks......100.....they have to replace thousands of obsolete models, and they havent produced any since they showed it back in 2015 (which was 3 years ago I remind you) 

here is a interesting text from wiki about it : ''The Russian Federation was expecting to order 2,300 new main battle tanks for delivery by 2020. In 2015, Russian media had announced that around 20 tanks had been delivered for testing, without naming a source,[77] and at least seven T-14 Armata tanks appeared in the 2015 and 2016 Moscow Victory Day parade, five in 2017.

But in 2016 the Russian defence ministry announced that it had signed a contract for a “test batch” of 100 tanks to be delivered by 2020, with the full project extended until 2025.'' 

Which that kind of speed, they wont replace their T-72 models until like year 2100 or something. And its like that with all of their equipment. Their media has been talking on about their high tech PAK 5th generation fighter since like early 2000's , and still none are in service in 2018. All of their air force still use designs from Soviet era (aside from a few trainer planes). Look into their current inventory of 2018, and find something thats not from Soviet era.....I can find very few things and they are small and mostly insignificant (like uniforms and small drones).

They're much better off being in between them and managing their interests through soft power. Israel can't risk attacking NATO members since NATO is the only reason Israel could've ever survived and in that case, it could mean splitting the alliance, making the world ready for a huge shift in geopolitical power that they really can't use. 

There's a lot of these conflicting interests and countries that can't risk attacking their 'opponents' in the Syrian civil war where Israel and Turkey are both involved for very different reasons, which is why the politics surrounding it are so complicated and mostly aimed at managing the military engagements (like Russia and the US synchronizing their attacks and movements despite being on different sides) to prevent it from spiraling into WWIII.

So, what they are doing is forging a type of government that will be popular to the idiots who believed their campaign promises, by lowering taxes and spending on the public sector, and at the same time hammering the EU from all angles, they will complain about migrants, and the debt, all the greatest hits. 

So, when their policies eventually fail and their coalition comes crashing down, they can point to the EU as obstructing them and their policies, and go to the polls saying ""no, it's not our fault, the EU is out to get Italy.""

3362,"While PKK claims to not kill civilians it has done it a lot in the past, not counting the fact that their attacks on Turkish millitary and police often result in deaths of innocent bystanders (newsflash: exploding IEDs, shooting AKs and throwing hand grenades in densely populated areas results in a lot of collateral damage). From July 2015 to December 2017 attacks by PKK on Turkish soil resulted in around 400 civilian deaths. PKK are also known for kidnapping and assassinating teachers who they do not really consider civilians as they work for Turkish government and also teach Turkish language at schools located in Kurdish-majority areas. They also have a habit of stopping and setting trucks on fire to cause economic damage to Turkish state. Do you know what happens to truckers that refuse to get out of their vehicles or let their livelihood destroyed? That’s right, they get killed.

By the way, the non-civilians PKK attacks and kills are often not armed members of Turkish Armed Forces or millitary police, but also regular cops (even traffic cops performing routine check-ups or patrols) and unarmed conscripts.

Then you have the TAK that engages in full-on terrorist activity and directly targets civilians in ISIS-style suicide bombings. The claim is that TAK and PKK have split from each other, but in a mindblowing turn of events identified TAK members always turn out to be active PKK members and arms that go to PKK often magically end up in TAK’s hands. Their relationship is still heavily debated and TAK is pretty much known as the off-shoot of PKK that is reserved for dirty jobs (such as attacking civilians) so that PKK wouldn’t damage their reputation.

Also the “self-defence militia by Kurds” definition doesn’t work if you’re fighting not in the name of what majority of Kurds believe in but for a very specific ideology most of them do not subcribe to and have no problem attacking and intimidating fellow Kurds who do not agree with you or even assassinate people within your own organizations for not agreeing with you.",,/r/europe/comments/8jo4cu/erdoğans_clapback/dz2fnoi/,ereniwe,1526470252

He claimed the the eu was subsidizing Airbus to give them a competitive advantage over Boeing and he claimed it was unfair...when the reality is they did it to counter us subsidies to Boeing that was letting them undercut every other manufacturer....it's no mystey why the market is split 50/50 between the two companies

Airbus was literally set up by Europeans to counter us monoploy of production through their government subsidies and exclusive contracts that no other company suspiciously ever won


These were defensive actions not offensive actions , they were reacting not instigating 


It's like trump saying it's unfair poor people get government assistance as it gives them a competitive advantage over people that don't....you could say technically that's true but it's not close to the factual reality that it's there to attempt to create parirty between inequality. Not instigate inequality 


https://www.politico.eu/article/us-claims-sweeping-victory-in-airbus-subsidy-case/


&gt;Yet, the victory might be short-lived for Boeing: The WTO is expected to follow up on today’s Airbus verdict with a second ruling that will fault the U.S. for insufficiently addressing concerns about subsidies benefiting the American company, people familiar with the case told the Wall Street Journal.

&gt;The EU claims the U.S. space agency NASA funded federal programs funneled more than $2.6 billion to Boeing, and other forms of tax breaks and federal level help in the U.S aerospace giant for around $8 billion. Some $2.2 billion in export subsidies also need to be added to the Boeing subsidy list, according to the European Commission.





As with everything trump what he claimed was out of context, devoid of the facts of the case and a complete manipulation of the truth and reality of the situation and yet people like you still lap it up

3587,"&gt; It's false thinking that ever growing economy inevitably means ever growing energy consumption. The latter has stopped in developed world, for example. 

Infinite growth on a finite planet is NOT possible. What makes it so sacred anyways? Why do we even need this much growth? It's not only about energy consumption, it's also about resource depletion and pollution. Your graph just shows that our energy consumption has increased since the 2000, and it was unsustainable even then. 

&gt;Just think about it, modern home appliances are more energy-efficient than older ones

While lasting only a decade at best forcing you to buy a new one...

&gt;Cars are more fuel-efficient

While we still have one billion cars driving around...

&gt;buildings more energy-efficient

While being constantly built everywhere while old houses are demolished. 

&gt;Of course, it has required a lot of pressure from environmental protection regulations to achieve, but we're already seeing the results.

Yeah, the result being the continuation of this unsustainable system and our unsustainable lifestyles. 

&gt;With energy consumption in small decline, accompanied with transitioning to green energy, I don't understand where's the problem.

Obviously you don't. You see, the problem is not the efficiency of our modern system, the problem is the gigantic volume of it that reaches almost every part of the planet. Energy consumption is enormous, resource consumption is enormous, ecological damage is enormous... Yeah, green energy is cool and nice, but that alone wont fix the inherent issues with infinite growth. 

&gt;Sure, that is still not the case everywhere in the world, but we've shown that this is achievable and I don't see why developing world wouldn't ultimately end up the same, most likely even quicker due to modern technology.

The 1st world is not sustainable by any metric. When the 3rd world catches up, we are even more unsustainable in the big picture. Why are people still ignoring the elephant in the room? Why are people still maintaining this system where the endless growth of profit and wealth exceeds all other values such as environmental ones? It doesn't benefit us, it doesn't benefit our planet. Where are all the alternatives? 50 years ago we at least had communism, 80 years ago we had fascism, but now we only have this free market capitalism and we treat it as some natural state of being and don't even think about alternatives...

&gt;I think with growing economy we're actually reaching the topic of what exactly do we mean with economy. We usually mean GDP which is not an ideal measurement of economic activity. It doesn't necessarily measure efficiency, productivity and welfare development. So burning more coal would end up with a higher GDP, even though that's not necessarily positive. The key is to look at more indicators, which is again, being already done, at least in EU, which also takes energy consumption for comparison.

We don't need a bigger economy. We don't need growth. That's the reality. And if we want to fight against the climate change, we should not grow anymore. ",Greater Finland,/r/europe/comments/8jk4fz/eu_gdp_numbers_is_out_25_pct_yoy_q1_growth_in_eu/dz257i7/,DiethylamideProphet,1526448815

Anyways -- I suppose both of us are getting a bit hung up on metaphysical concepts here. Just like I am considering only the ability to feel and think a basic requirement to qualify as a human being, you are looking only at the definition of ""human organism"" with complete disregard for its stage of development/viability/sentience.

I suppose both our perspective are easy to criticize that way, due to how we have drawn these lines. However, I maintain that my perspective is much less harmful, as there should be no negative feelings from the two parties involved: one will be the mother, whose decision to terminate the pregnancy would obviously signify her considering this choice as the better one, and the other would be the unborn child, which would never have developed the ability to feel and think in the first place.

And don't you think that this sentience is a critically important part of what makes us ""human""? Though I admit, I do sense a bit of irony that you are arguing from a strictly biological point of view, whereas it is now me who is debating emotion. But forced birth, in the worst case scenario, will ruin two lives, whereas termination will save one and at least prevent ruining the other, on account of never having acquired sapience, never having acquired *life*, in the first place.

But I'm also curious as to the source of your perspective: why exactly do you draw the line at fertilization and not before? If a fertilized egg deserves protection, why not the unfertilized one? What makes the transformation that is fertilization different from the transformation that would, hopefully, later result in the capability to actually think and feel?",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8d80nf/irish_abortion_referendum_poster_placement/dz1tk2x/,akashisenpai,1526435129

I'd assume that this was taken into account by whoever constructed the financial instruments, but you'd think that a euro-denominated pension fund would favor investments in the Eurozone to avoid having to offset dollar-euro shifts.

If mean, if you're having to pay out euros and backing it with US dollar mortgages and the dollar weakens substantially relative to the euro, that's gotta be pretty horrendous for someone along the line.

This refers exactly to the railroad incident I described above and is a ""he said she said"" story nothing wrong done here its perfectly acceptable for a government to purchase stocks. 

The only magic here is that they did not want to shut down the national railroad business and instead rejuvenated it by purchasing its stocks.

Apartheid doesn't necessarily have to be race-based. Apartheid is any legal regime that legally distinguishes between types of people affording privileges to one type over the other.

&gt;here is one Jewish state while there are about a dozen Muslim/Islamic and Christian states. Is allowing the Jews to have their own state too much to ask?

The problem with the Jewish state thing is that there are loads of people who are not Jewish. Of Israeli citizens only 75% are Jewish. If Israel didn't claim to be a liberal democracy is wouldn't matter, but because they do they can't simultaneously profess a state religion.

&gt;the land of Israel was Jewish before it was ever Muslim.

Well, that's literally true because Judaism is older than Islam.

3883,"&gt; Well, you are right, I should have said ""functional military,"" no not no military.

Well, it's actually even functional. Sort of. It's why our soldiers are in Afghanistan. (Remember how that beauty came to pass? As I recall it, because Germans aren't pacificts, but honour the agreements to stand by their allies when they are in need of support. Strangely, that support hasn't gotten us anywhere safer or even anything but harassment from the ones who made the call.)

And in Mali, along with ouf French allies. 

And our navy vessels on patrol around the Horn of Africa, to clean up the mess your 'protection' caused in Somalia. 

And in Iraq, were German army officers are training and supplying the Kurds you abandoned. 

And in Sudan. Where German military advisors make sure that your awesome American weapons don't end up in the hands of ISIS-affiliates (like they did in Iraq after you pulled out).

&gt; The funniest thing about all this is that there is no bigger enabler of US imperialism than Germany. Not only are you a massive military base for the US (from which activities the German public abhors are launched from)

Correct. And that's not counting the bases which are used to wiretap our officials, kidnap our citizens and engage in industrial espionage against our corporations. Incidentally, that's three things the Russians hadn't done to us since the end of the Cold War, just in case you wondered. But then again, the Russians aren't our 'allies', so I guess you couldn't expect anything else that neutrality from those vile bastards. 

And you're wondering why your credibility is stooping to the lowest levels in the history of transatlantic relations around here. 

&gt; Not to mention how much you will increasingly disappoint France, who has wanted a European foreign policy/defense since the '50s.

Yes, and until very recently has been the biggest domestic hindrance to it because of their beef with the United Kingdom. 

&gt; And while your economic intergration fantasy is nice, it was disproven before WWI, when so many argued that a continental war was impossible.

Perhaps it could have something to do with lacking a common currency?

&gt; So your pacifism at all costs will continue to keep the EU weak and dependent on the US while your PM makes occasional comments about being independent from the US.

For once (and quite briefly), I've got to shower praise on Donald John Trump: Nobody has ever managed to alienate Europeans as quickly as he has while bringing down American credibility and reliability even faster than Herbert Hoover. He may be the worst president in living memory for Americans, but for those of us who don't want to see the European Union running aground, he may be just the push we needed to get our act together.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8jm1hm/germanys_typhoon_problem_only_four_fighters_can/dz1l3br/,ColourFox,1526426765

The problem I have with your position is that it isn't the pathways to pain that would really matter, right? It'd be the actual ability to feel pain. If pain could be felt without a pathway, that'd certainly qualify, right?

And the presence of the pathways isn't enough by itself to feel pain- say, a person in a coma can't feel pain but certainly has the pathways. 

Furthermore, the ability to feel pain isn't a great indicator in the first place. Animals can feel pain, for example, but nearly no-one would consider them to have the same moral/ethical worth as humans. 

It's the existence as a distinct human organism that really matters, not its stage of development. Now, there's debates to be had about the efficacy of policy, but to ignore the human existence of an entire class of people in an ""out-of-sight, out-of-mind"" sort of way isn't fully honest.

Exactly. And our 'middle ground', as you call it, is building a political structure to pacify the Continent domestically by means of trade, exchange, mutual understanding and mediation.

In other words: Our middle ground is political integration, not military confrontation. It's the EU, not NATO. And when it comes to that, it isn't exactly helping that our brethren across the pond are constantly haranguing us because we're too peaceful for the taste of Washington warhawks whose only concern is to scare the American people into believing they have to cough up 700 billion bucks a year to fend off imaginary enemies.

Did anyone ever dare to tell you to your face how ridiculous it is to watch from afar how Americans are scared of everyone else on the planet despite inhabiting the richest and most powerful country in the world which has complete domination of the two oceans at its shores and no enemy at its borders?

Either Americans are the most frightful people in the history of mankind or they basically have resigned themselves to the fate of being fleeced to the tunes of trillions a year to enrich the military-industrial complex which runs the place in all but name.

We've weathered all of that lot so far and are still pretty much on deck to make sure it stays that way.

Secondly, it does not matter how much you devalue your currency, because there is China which will produce product cheaper. It was a major change since introducing Euro.

Devaluation is politically more acceptable solution than internal devaluation, but I do not think it would be a magic wand which would fix problems. Problems within economy would still persist, problems within banking sector would still persist, exports would also suffer due currency conversions.

4075,"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/george-soros-ss-nazi-germany/

&gt; Yet the simple truth is that George Soros neither said nor did anything resembling what he has been accused of. In no sense was Soros, who turned 14 years old not long after the Germans occupied Hungary in 1944, a “Nazi collaborator.” At no time did he confiscate (or help confiscate) the property of Jews, “identify Jews to the Nazis,” or help “round up” people targeted for deportation or extermination by the Germans (to answer just a few of the accusations leveled against him). And although Soros did attest during the infamous 60 Minutes interview that he regrets nothing about the time of German occupation, he also said it is precisely because he didn’t do any of the things attributed to him that his conscience is clear.

&gt; ""Shortly after George went to live with Baumbach, the man was assigned to take inventory on the vast estate of Mor Kornfeld, an extremely wealthy aristocrat of Jewish origin. The Kornfeld family had the wealth, wisdom, and connections to be able to leave some of its belongings behind in exchange for permission to make their way to Lisbon. Baumbach was ordered to go to the Kornfeld estate and inventory the artworks, furnishings, and other property. Rather than leave his “godson” behind in Budapest for three days, he took the boy with him. As Baumbach itemized the material, George walked around the grounds and spent time with Kornfeld’s staff. It was his first visit to such a mansion, and the first time he rode a horse. He collaborated with no one and he paid attention to what he understood to be his primary responsibility: making sure that no one doubted that he was Sandor Kiss [Soros’s assumed identity]. Among his practical concerns was to make sure that no one saw him pee.""

&gt; George’s father, Tivadar Soros, provided a similar account of the incident in his 1965 autobiography, Masquerade: Dancing Around Death in Nazi Occupied Hungary (note: Tivadar gives the name of the ministry official as “Baufluss,” but Soros confirmed to us that the correct name is Baumbach):

&gt; “He even helped with the inventory,” Tivadar Soros wrote — a detail one doesn’t find in Kaufman’s book. Some may rush to cite this as proof that Soros was a “collaborator” after all, but given that it occurred on only one occasion, and that Soros was under an imperative to convincingly play the part of Baumbach’s godson while in the company of the actual Nazi collaborators, it doesn’t fly.

&gt; Moreover, these biographical passages demonstrate that Steve Kroft’s claim on 60 Minutes that Soros “accompanied his phony godfather on his appointed rounds, confiscating property from the Jews” is flat-out false. Tivadar Soros wrote that most of young George’s time under Baumbach’s care was spent alone in the latter’s apartment. Both Tivadar and Kaufman report that George only resided with Baumbach for a short time — a matter of weeks — before Tivadar, concerned that his son’s real identity was in danger of exposure, shipped him off to spend the summer of 1944 with his mother (who herself was living under an assumed name at a lakeside resort some distance from Budapest). George Soros spent no further time with Baumbach.

4162,"&gt;This isn't a proof of anything, no one argued over that. However, the number of schools in minority languages halved, while those in Hungarian doubled. That's Magyarisation. 

How many Hungarian schools were there in 1918 compared to 2018? My point was that they were free to study in their language, yes the church funded schools were in Hungarian, but there were plenty Slovakian and Romanian ones too. Just like nowadays most of the schools are Römanian there too, doesn't mean Hungarian ones don't exist.

&gt;Again, we weren't recognised as an ethnic group in Transylvania. There's a difference between that and what you said. 

This is not true, the term they used was államalapító, which kinda means founders of the state, of course they didn't add Romanians as one of the main ethnicities of Transylvania, as when it was created as a seperate entity it was ruled by Hungarian, with the Szeklers and Germans.

But this lack of recognition didn't give them less rights, just less representation which is I don't deny.

&gt;I've never heard of such thing happening. I'm from Timisoara where the revolution started and no Hungarian name was translated into Romanian. Hell, the Romanian revolution started in Timisoara with some protest that supported a Hungrian priest, Laszlo Tokes. No one tried to make his name sound Romanian either. 

Just because you didn't hear from it doesn't mean it didn't happen. Just like the """"romanian"""" king Matthias.

So still, the Romanians were allowed to study in their own language, and use it in institutions. Where is the Magyarisation? If it's having more Hungarian schools than Romanian ones, surely you also claim that the rapid decline of Hungarian schools after 1918 and surge of Romanian ones are also Romaninastion?",Hajrá Magyarország,/r/europe/comments/8jl0id/today_170_years_ago_the_great_national_gathering/dz16gvd/,AnOSRSplayer,1526412833

4191,"I can tell two notable examples (I'm not in any kind of contact with the rest of them so I don't want to bullshit):

* I had a classmate who actually cared a lot about her own identity. Her mother was teaching Romology (Romani studies) at the university. The girl actually learned a Lovári/Lovarícko (a Vlax Romani language) for her school-leaving exam (Bacalaureat for you I think), did charity work and helped poor Gypsies with organizing constructive activities for them. She also knew Gypsy legends for our amusement, for example that Gypsies were kidnapped by the Devil and taken to Hell, that's where they got burned and that's why they have brown skin; before they escaped back to the world.

* The other one is a family living close to my grandparents. They bought the house of an old, crippled alcoholic guy who was my grandpa's coworker and spent his last years getting drunk and singing on his balcony. Anyway, after he died this family bought his house and renovated it, planted lawn and flowers in the garden, re-pained the fences etc. They've been living in our street for a good 10 years now and they are pretty well-respected, they are not noisy, their garden is always clean (they sometimes swipe the pavement in front of their house too), they are very modest and friendly and their son is going to school regularly and speaks perfect, accentless Hungarian with a huge active vocabulary.

In comparison we got new neighbours who are the opposite and would kinda fit the Gypsy steretype but are actually both very whites. The man was sentenced to prison twice for illegal activities, they have 5 cars (who knows from where), organize parties with their loud friends on Saturdays and Sundays until 4 am (in a silent village). The woman is a wreck and is constantly shouting at their pood daughter, their 3 dogs are mad and kept in a very small, dirty place.

After € (and as mentioned the crisis), the real wage growth was lower then ever before YoY because the inflation was pretty high. In 2012  and 2013 the inflation was actually higher than the wage increase so the real wage was reduced. We went over 1000€ in 2014.

4234,"""soca-rel?"" xD

If I'm not mistaken, you said you're an American that stayed about 20 years here, and I'm wondering —and honestly asking, here!— where or in which kind of environment did you actually stay so that you used to hear that kind of terminology?

Because, honestly first time in more than a decade that I hear that expression —which translates, literally, to *pura cepa*, an expression that is common among all the Spanish territory otoh, and so it's nothing special in that sense.

Soca-rel is usually referred to those that are the closest to catalan nationality and traditions, but it's by no means something related to xenophobia. *i.e. Carod-Rovira is a ""soca-rel"" catalan, when he's from spanish parents.* It's also used in a mocking way, by catalans themselves. It's not as if it's something to be proud, but it can be part of your reality.

Also, and just remembering here, that when you don't have your status recognised as a minority, it's up to you to identify as such. Your claim of equalling identifying as a Catalan —and not an Spaniard— would be like saying that the black sportsmen that don't bend the knee during the Anthem are anti-Americans —an accusation they do get, plenty.

&gt;So you say that C's, created in Catalunya as Ciutadans, with the leader of the party a Catalan, are anti-Catalan xenophobes? 

Well, they don't even chant [the official hymn](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DRKgzycWAAAGdzx.jpg) so... xD

Ciudadanos is a party that created havoc in catalan schools where there has never been. That's what earnt them the votes for their kick-start: their anti-catalan policies being harder than those of PP, effectivelly earning their votes. In Madrid, PP doesn't even back them when they try to pass laws to destroy the catalan school system —which they did recently. Nobody sides with them, certainly not PSC.

A few of their ideological founders are also far-right ideologically. Arcadi Espada called for punishing the mothers that decided to not abort babies with detected Down Syndrome, for an example —because of eugenical reasons. He also defended rape culture recently, by siding with the rapists of La Manada.

Ciudadanos also regularly demonstrates among various far-right, filo-fascist groups and leaders —which [are also their voters](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DdJgBTyWsAEKvGL.jpg). Then they say they don't identify with none of that, yet they don't actively tell them out of their demos —because they need their votes, which earn by default with inaction.

For the trolls flooding this thread, I remember some of them since years ago (u/fluchtpunkt, u/VERTIKAL19), cause at every occasion they got they were pushing Kremlin's agenda and defending Russia. u/fluchtpunckt was also heavily lobbying during the greater migrant crisis for keeping the EU's outer borders open and for taking all the migrants to Europe, which I found strange coming from him, a supposed German whose country was already under heavy pressure from the constant flow. What's even more interesting, all these trolls' writing style is so similar that they could as well be one person having dozens or hundreds of accounts with different usernames and flags and writing for all of them. So real Germans of r/europe, imagine the Russians doing these things now to Germany, the EU, USA, what do you think will they do if they will have even more leverage against the EU when they've already done so much damage to both the EU and Europe? Do you like your public opinion, on which Merkel is basing her policies, to be so heavily influenced by Russia? And what the fuck are your secret services doing?

It happens when you start university or when you get your first proper job here. Which is usually when you're ~20.

And I think that has a lot to do with the resources available to a 21 year old. A typical 21 year old can afford his own place here, with or without support from his parents.

4438,"&gt;In any event there are also negative consequences for early leaving your family like  being estranged from them because you lack daily interactions.

We still visit our parents every week. Quite often meeting the family for dinner. Very often visit over the weekends.

It's of course harder if you decide to go to university in the US or mainland Europe. But that's unavoidable.

&gt;Also, participating in family life like an adult and not a teen what helps you understand the meaning of responsibility, which if you’re living by yourself with everything paid does not happen because you’re not accountable for anything.

You start working here as a young teenager. Every summer vacation and often your Christmas vacation is spent working. You earn your own money as a teenager and you spend it on what you need.

This teaches kids responsibility at a very young age. Not only financial responsibility, but their first taste of the responsibility of a fully functioning worker in the job market.

When I got my own apartment in university I paid for my own food, my own rent, my own books. I paid for everything myself, with the money I earned over the summer and every vacation I spent working. Also with all the money I had saved up as a teenager, for all the work I did back then.

Did I get some help from the system here in Iceland? Yes I did, but that's all it was. A little help to keep us going. I had to be exceptionally careful with my money from a very young age, I had to really think about everything I spent it on.

Moving out helps you grow up really fast. Getting a job as a teenager does so as well.

4474,"&gt;Why is there so much stigma regarding people living with their parents in the North?

Nordic countries especially are much more individualistic than the southern european ones, so living by yourself is considered an important step in becoming a self-sufficient adult. But it doesn't mean you have to go immediately when you turn 18/20. I lived with my parents until I was 25 because the place was located close to the university and as a guy in a wheelchair I couldn't easily get a part time job until the last 2 years of my studies, after which I chose to save up the money instead of spend most of it on rent so I could get my own place as soon as I graduated, and I did. I'm in good terms with my parents (and my brothers) and still visit them regularly, but u/9las is correct: it's a statement of independence.

Also keep this in mind: in the Nordic countries student (rental) housing where you share the place with other students is (relatively) cheap and affordable at the student-benefit levels of income that everyone studying full time gets, so for many there's no economic barrier to the move.

The dating thing is also a definite thing: if you're past your early 20s and you take your date to a place that you share with your parents, it tends to send a signal that you can't take care of yourself and your chances of getting onto the 2nd date are slim.

Not the ""lot of"" us Brits - we're not a hive mind by the way, so don't feel you have to make a judgement on the whole country as incapable of a stable partnership based on my reply. 

My feelings when I responded are at least driven by a fairly consistent anti-British rhetoric here. However, if you are trying to paint me, or other remainers or just other brits in a particular light, my actual views have not changed which is precisely why I said i wasn't advocating any particular response based on my feelings of annoyance. 

I wish we had voted remain, I still want to have a close as relationship as possible with the EU. That doesn't mean I'm immune to annoyance caused by the lets punish the brits, we want to see them burn brigade.

4486,"&gt;What exactly did you do in your early twenties that you couldn't do in your parents home? Throw a rager everyday?

Pretty much, but more like every weekend. I could also eat whatever/whenever I wanted. I could stay up at night doing whatever without waking other people up. I could study in peace without worrying about other stuff I had to do. I could take home girls without it being super awkward the next morning. I could have sex without my parents hearing us in the room next door. I could do whatever I wanted with my home (as long as my landlord didn't get mad). I could live close to university so I didn't have to commute &gt;2 hours every day. I could move to a city I liked better than where I grew up. I could move into a flat with my friends, and spend more time with them. I could move to another country if I wanted to and see how that is like. 

&gt;That's not how the economy works. Prices and wages are mostly spontaneous and are greatly affected by both supply and demand. And these in turn are affected by a whole bunch of reasons. Had it been a simple policy choice we would have flipped the switch a long time ago.

Yes, exactly. It's not just about culture or whatever, in a lot of cases people are stopped from doing what they want because of money.

And also be someone's rival because you are too much alike and therefore compete for the same things. It's one thing to say something and it's another thing entirely to do it.

I know that Taiwan and some east Asian countries support gay rights. Today they have the same values as the West and US. Are countries like Romania wahhabi because their society isnt pro-LBGTQ?.

You assume Chechen culture is sexist for what reason exactly? what part of our culture leads to rape or violence against women? In our culture a man cannot approach or touch a woman without her permission. Violence against women is punishable by death in Chechen culture. The ancient vendetta codes(which is banned by Kadyrov) said that if a man kills a woman from a different clan then the other clan has a right to kill 2 men from the other clan. If a Woman kills a woman from a different clan then the clan has a right to kill a man from the other clan. Not a good example but it shows that our culture values woman and does not support sexism.

The problem here is that you and me have different culture, in your culture women were treated as ""Objects"". Giving a woman a slap on the ass in a random cafe in the US was seen as normal in the 1950s THAT is Sexism. In Chechnya if i say ""hey sexy wanna fuck?"" to a woman i will get beat up.

We have several statues of honoring women in Chechnya, one example is the ladies from Dadi-yurt. We have ""womens day"" and all that, there is no such thing as ""mans day"". In our culture women are treated better than men. All this will of course fall on deaf ears because you dont know our culture, you assume everyone who has a different culture is ""sexist"".

Whats with the article you linked? Kadyrov said he condones any honor-killing of gay people. Does that disprove anything i said?

""Then that only proves my point that secular leaders declined to be replaced by wahabbis.""

What are you talking about? you throw around words like wahhabi and secular leaders. Who declined to be a secular leader and for what??

The fact that you assume a woman wearing hijab is a ISIS supporter means that you know nothing of our culture.

""Woman-hatred, child-murder and ISIS-support neatly summarize your culture and traditions.""

I assume you are a troll now, wasted couple of minutes on you. Congrats you had my attention for a couple of minutes. Slither back under the bridge now.

4562,"&gt; BUDAPEST – The list was spread across two pages, white type on a black background.
&gt; 
&gt; There, plain for all to see in a prominent pro-government magazine, were the names of 200 academics, journalists, human rights advocates and others.
&gt; 
&gt; They were the “mercenaries” of Hungarian American financier George Soros, the accompanying article explained. And this was an enemies list.
&gt; 
&gt; At once it was a relic from a darker time in Hungary’s history and a modern-day symbol of just how far the country has veered toward a rebirth of autocracy under Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
&gt; 
&gt; The prime minister has spared little effort in vilifying Soros. Orban has made the Jewish philanthropist the heart of numerous government smear campaigns, countless xenophobic speeches and several pieces of punitive legislation. Before Hungary voted last month, he vowed “revenge” against Soros and his allies for their role in a supposed plot to flood the country with Muslim refugees.
&gt; 
&gt; Publication of the list, just days after Orban won a sweeping electoral victory, seemed to be confirmation that the prime minister intended to make good on his pledge. The magazine’s owner, after all, is a close Orban ally and would have been unlikely to publish it without encouragement from top levels of the government.
&gt; 
&gt; The list was met with a tide of condemnation, including from Michael Ignatieff, president of the Budapest-based Central European University, who called it “a flagrant attempt at intimidation.”
&gt; 
&gt; But if that was the goal, evidence soon grew from Ignatieff’s own faculty at the Soros-funded university that it hadn’t entirely succeeded.
&gt; 
&gt; Miklos Koren, a mild-mannered CEU economist, was outraged when he saw the list. First, because it existed. Then, because he wasn’t on it.
&gt; 
&gt; Not that he had done much to deserve inclusion. He said he generally avoids politics. But others on the list didn’t seem to merit their spots, either. Some were even dead.
&gt; 
&gt; “The only common theme among the 200 names was that at some point, they had all received money from an organization that was Soros-funded,” Koren said. “I could imagine this kind of document in the dark corners of the Internet. But it was shocking to see it in print.”
&gt; 
&gt; So Koren took to the Internet and launched a petition to have his name included among the enemies. He encouraged anyone else who wanted to be added to sign as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Weeks later, nearly 8,000 people have added their names.
&gt; 
&gt; Many have left comments:
&gt; 
&gt; “My husband is on the list. They excluded me. I demand equal credit.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Liberal democracy should be defended.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Wherever there’s a list, I want to be on it.”
&gt; 
&gt; Some signatories pointed out that Orban himself qualifies as a Soros “mercenary,” having received a scholarship from the billionaire to study at Oxford as a young man.
&gt; 
&gt; The reaction, Koren said, “was heartwarming.”
&gt; 
&gt; It was also revealing about the state of modern Hungary, where Orban exercises near-total control and bullying tactics are common. But there’s also free expression, with opponents speaking out on television, in newspapers and on the streets. On May 8, the day the new parliament was sworn into office, thousands of opponents rallied against Orban just outside.
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s not Turkey. It’s not Russia,” said Gabor Klaniczay. “It’s a new form of autocracy.”
&gt; 
&gt; Klaniczay, a medieval studies professor at CEU, was on the list. But he’s used to it. He was on enemies’ lists during communist times as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Back then, he said, it was because he would occasionally sign petitions circulated among dissidents who sought changes to the regime.
&gt; 
&gt; This time, there appears to have been a more prosaic reason: He was included in a Wikipedia entry of notable CEU faculty from past and present, which had been copied name for name. Hence the names of the dead.
&gt; 
&gt; “It was very lazy,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; Other organizations had their entire staff lists copied and included, right down to the administrative assistants.
&gt; 
&gt; At the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights group, most of the staff members rolled their eyes at the list, said co-chair Marta Pardavi. They’ve grown accustomed to being targeted.
&gt; 
&gt; But that wasn’t true of everyone. An administrative assistant reported that her parents were getting abuse from their neighbors, who wondered why they had a Soros mercenary in the family.
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s an extreme example of harassment, and it does impact people,” Pardavi said.
&gt; 
&gt; It also comes in the context of a very real crackdown on civil society, with the government using legislation to make it very uncomfortable – if not impossible – for many independent organizations to operate.
&gt; 
&gt; And even if the government has not gone nearly as far as its counterparts in Turkey or Russia in suppressing dissent, some fear that’s where it’s headed.
&gt; 
&gt; “Let us not underestimate such petty and shameful projects like this list,” wrote one signatory to Koren’s petition. “Who knows where hate speech ends and political terror starts?”
&gt; 
&gt; The magazine that published the list – Figyelo, which means Observer in Hungarian – has dismissed such talk as “hysteria.” It has said that anyone who wants to be removed from the list should simply email the magazine and ask.
&gt; 
&gt; It’s not clear if anyone has done so. But Koren recently emailed the magazine with the names of thousands of people who want to be added.
&gt; 
&gt; “Could you please print these names in a 20-page special edition?” Koren said he asked.
&gt; 
&gt; There has been no reply.
&gt; 
&gt; Gergo Saling and Andras Petho, editors of the Hungarian investigative news website Direkt36, contributed to this report. Both were on the list.  ",He does it for free,/r/europe/comments/8jku37/two_hundred_names_appeared_on_an_enemies_list_in/dz0cyzp/,vernazza,1526383981

GNI actually, which is why RoI does well out of it (inflated GDP, but much lower GNI). The rebate lets us pay in less, as compensation for getting much less out of EU expenditure, thanks to CAP and other programs.

France is a very similar country (very similar populations and look at how we leapfrog in terms of GDP). France gets **double** the EU expenditure within their country that we do. This is why the rebate is fair and necessary for us. I would rather the whole system of contributions was made fair in the first place, but all we were able to get was the rebate.

Our **net** payments over the long run are about the same as France.

&gt;The € is necessary for the eu project as the eu is aiming for a closer union, if the uk isn t happy with that there is no point for joining the eu...states can trade with the eu without being part of it.

That seems pretty arbitrary. Even some countries have different currencies in different areas and do just fine (China + Hong Kong).

Because you hate passport control at airports? Schengen makes *a lot of sense* for countries on the continent where you might pop across the border in your car, or on a walk! It makes zero sense for us, non-continentals. We have our own mini-Schengen for the British Isles which works fine.

4821,"&gt;In the European Union \(EU\), over one young adult out of four \(28.5&amp;#37;\) aged 25 to 34 were still living with their parents in 2016. Across the EU, this share ranged from less than 10&amp;#37; in the Nordic Member States – Denmark \(3.8&amp;#37;\), Finland \(4.3&amp;#37;\) and Sweden \(6.0&amp;#37;\) – to about half in Croatia \(58.7&amp;#37;\), Slovakia \(55.5&amp;#37;\), Greece \(55.0&amp;#37;\), Malta \(51.5&amp;#37;\) and Italy \(48.9&amp;#37;\).  
&gt;  
&gt;Overall, it is estimated that young people leave the parental household at the age of 26 years on average in the EU. But significant discrepancies can be observed between Member States.  
&gt;  
&gt;**In the Nordic Member States and Luxembourg, they flee in their early 20s…**  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2017 in the EU, young people left home earliest in the three Nordic Member States – Sweden \(21.0 years\), Denmark \(21.1 years\) and Finland \(21.9 years\) – as well as in Luxembourg \(21.4 years\). They were followed by those in Estonia \(23.1 years\), Belgium \(23.4 years\), the Netherlands \(23.6 years\), Germany \(23.7\), France \(24.0 years\) and the United Kingdom \(24.4 years\).  
&gt;  
&gt;**… But wait until their 30s in Malta, Croatia, Malta, Slovakia and Italy**  
&gt;  
&gt;At the opposite end of the scale, young adults in Malta and Croatia remained the longest in the parental household. They left home at an average age of 32.2 and 31.9 respectively. Young adults in Slovakia \(30.8 years\), Italy \(30.1 years\), Greece \(29.4 years\), Spain \(29.3 years\), Portugal \(29.2 years\) and Bulgaria \(28.9 years\) also left the parental home at a later stage.  
&gt;  
&gt;It should also be noted that in every EU Member State, young women tended to leave the parental household earlier than men. The highest differences between the genders were registered in Romania \(25.6 years for women, compared with 30.3 for men\), Bulgaria \(26.5 vs. 31.1\), Croatia \(30.4 vs. 33.4\), Slovakia \(29.4 vs. 32.2\), Hungary \(26.0 vs. 28.8\), Greece \(28.0 vs. 30.7\) and the Czech Republic \(25.1 vs. 27.7\).

Fair point, but I think it's better for them to not be able to vote mainly because it's not certain if they'll actually return or not. I'm not sure how to the Turks would be able to regulate this, but I think unless someone actively resides in that country they shouldn't be able to vote in that country's elections.

5006,"&gt;... the argument is about slavery. In other words slavery is highly relevant. I'm a bit confused exactly what you thought we were discussing?

&gt;And no, examining the logical principle you're suggesting is not a straw man. You can repeat it if you want, since repeating things without actually making an argument seems to be your thing, but it's just not. Reductio ad absurdum is not the same as straw man. If you think i've misinterpreted the logical principle you've suggested I think you should clearify exactly what principle you are suggesting.

The was not about slavery, but the military service as a responsibility of citizens of a country. You then came up with a magical new law that allows slavery, to make it easier to attack. That is not reductio ad absurdum, that's a strawman argument.

&gt;You are right, responsibilities are not necesserily coercion. However if you are coerced into taking on responsibilities aginst your will, that is coercion.

Except we are not talking about being coerced into taking responsibilities agains your will. A person in a democracy is not coerced into any responsibilities that he disagrees with. He chooses to comply with said responsibilities if he wants to reap the benefits of staying in that country.

&gt;Yes, not all responsibilties are coercion, that does not mean no responsibilties are coercion. That's just flawed logic.

I said no such thing. That's your invention, and it doesn't even make sense.

&gt;It doesn't matter if you can change laws or you can flee. That has no impact on whether it is coercion or not. Do you seriously not understand that those are seperate issues? Where in the definition of coercion does it say it has to be unchangable and impossible to flee from? It doesn't... right? Can we agree that for something to be coercion it does not have to be impossible to change nor impossible to flee from? Surely you would agree with that, no?

&gt;Rape is coercion, it doesn't matter if you can possibly punch the rapist and run away... it's still coercion. If you have some other argument why laws are not coercion, feel free. But saying you can change it or flee is just not an argument.

It absolutely matters that you can change laws or leave. You have rights, and you can affect the laws yourself. A slave has no rights, and cannot leave. Coercion is naturally something you can't avoid, otherwise you would not be coerced into doing it.

And now you compare rape to laws. Rape is coercion because it is forced on the victim that is not given the option to reject it, being able to punch the rapist or whatever absurdities you keep coming up with is irrelevant.

&gt;Sure, but it's not a contract in any sense of the word. The fact that you and some other people call it a contract doesn't mean it is one... it just isn't.

&gt;A social contract is an idea or, at best, a theory. It's not actually a contract just because it has the word ""contract"" in the name. A contract is a very specific thing.

It's a contract in every sense of the word. If you associate yourself with other people, you have to abide by whatever social contracts they have in place.

It's a contract not because it has the word ""contract"" in it, but because you are literally agreeing to conform to certain terms while you are dealing with people to whom that contract applies.

&gt;And by responding to my previous post you automatically consented to sending me $100. When are you going to uphold your part of the contract?

I never consented to sending you $100, because there is no law that states anything like that. You are on Reddit, so Reddit rules apply, not whatever lunacy you decide to come up with.

&gt;But no, being born in a country does not mean you've consented to anything. That's absurd.

Your parents have consented to anything that involves you, until you are of legal age yourself. You are free to change your country of residence and the citizenship if you want.

&gt;Rules are not contracts.

&gt;I have a rule that I don't allow socialists in my home. That doesn't mean I have a contract with all socialists. And I don't need a contract, I just need a rule.

None of this is relevant to the discussions, just more invalid comparisons and fallacies from your end.

&gt;Are you dumb or something? Comparing two things is not a straw man... what's wrong with you? I suggest you google what a straw man is.

&gt;But yes, a government and the mafia are very similar. Both are monopolies of force.

I don't think you understand how strawmans work...

The government is not similar to mafia. One is a body that serves the people, another is a criminal organization.

&gt;Purpose doesn't matter. Something that is coercion doesn't suddenly become not coercion because the purpose has changed.

&gt;It's like discussing philosophy with a eight year old. Do you understand that in life there are different issues that can and should be discusses seperately? 

What do you mean, purpose doesn't matter? The purpose of the government is not changing, it's there all the time, and it does not involve coercing you to do anything that isn't your responsibility, that you agree with in the first place.

&gt;Let's pretend that's true. That's not a contract. A contract is only a contract between the parties that agree to it. You and your friend can't make a contract that applies to me without me agreeing to it. You do understand that right?

That's true whether you pretend to or not. You keep misunderstanding the concept of ""agreeing"". You automatically agree to abide by the law whenever you enter or remain in a country. If you don't agree, you will simply not be allowed to enter or remain in the country.

Me and my friend can make a contract that applies to me and my friend, and if you want to join our friendship you'll have to agree to its terms as well. Otherwise you'll simply not join if you don't want to.

&gt;Oh that's so cute. The american people came out in force and demanded their government to subsidize Brazilian cotton farmers? Of course not, no one but politicians and cotton farmers want those subsidies... yet the american people have to pay for it.

&gt;In other words the government made a law that restricted the freedom of it's people. 

That doesn't mean that the government made a law that restricted the freedom of its people. It's a matter of fund allocation, and you can take it up with the government that you elected. You gave them the right to make such decisions on your behalf.

&gt;Yes they are. What happends to you if you refuse to pay taxes? You will be subject to violence. Ding ding ding, that's coercion.

&gt;The fact that I comply under threat of violence doesn't mean it's not coerion... that's dumb.

That's not coercion. You need to go back a bit. Why were you in a country that requires you to pay taxes? Did you think it lets you stay in it for free? No, taxes are your payment for using the country. You used the country, and then complain that you are being ""coerced"" into paying for it. If you want to be a freeloader, you should have used a different country instead, one with no taxes.

&gt;No my agreement is non-existent. I comply under threat of violence. You're being absurd. I've never seen such logically flawed arguments in my life.

&gt;If I tell you i'm going to murder you unless you give me $10. The fact that you give me $10 in order to not be murdered doesn't mean that you agree nor that it's not coercion. That's absurd. And the fact that you can flee to mexico doesn't mean it's not coercion either.

You have never been explained how society works in your life. Your agreement is implicit, you comply because you have to compromise in order to reap the benefits of living in your country. You are not under threat of violence, you can leave any time you want, you just don't want to lose the benefits.

What's absurd is yet more nonsense of your murder argument.

They won't know you wheter you are Turkish citizen or not if you don't have a Turkish ID.

You return after 5 years and if they catch you in your third time then you are property of military. But you have option not to return to Turkey or give up your citizenship abroad, or just pay €1000.

Also I forget to mention but if you become a Turkish citizen after 22 (or 23) years old you are not obligated to become a consript, it is optional.

5108,"&gt;No, i'm using the logic of your argument to show it leads to absurd conclusions. It's called reductio ad absurdum and is a completely legitimate way of demonstrating the logical fallacy of an argument.

&gt;If that's not a conclusion that can be drawn from the logic you propose I would like you to explain why not. Just claiming it's a straw man is not an argument.

You couldn't argue against the reality of legal obligations of a person in a society, so you decided to come up with an extreme and ridiculous slavery argument instead, to argue against that. That is a strawman.

Do you think you have no responsibilities in your society? Those responsibilities are not slavery or coercion.


&gt;If slavery is the law... support slavery is per definition conforming with the law. If i'm wrong about that you're gonna have to explain how that is, because I don't get it.

If you disagree with the laws in your country, you can change them or leave the country.


&gt;That's not a contract. And government's change the constitution and break it all the time. Just look at the 2nd amendment in the US, try getting a gun legally in New York.

That is a social contract. That's a thing.

Changing any constitution is very difficult, governments certainly don't do it ""all the time"".

&gt;No I mean I haven't consented to it.

Your concent does not require a verbal or in written statement. You are in a country, so you automatically consent to abiding by its laws. You are not entering a country without agreeing with that.

&gt;Let me demonstrate. By responding to my previous message you consented to sendign me $100. We now have a contract... so when can I expect payment? No? You're not gonna honor this ""contract""?

I don't have any contract with you, because there are no rules stating that I owe you any money. There are rules that define your functions in a society,  so you'll have to abide by them.

&gt;That's highly debateable, but doesn't really matter since laws are not contracts. The government can change laws whenever and however they wish... that's not a contract. If you and I sign a contract, I can't just change the terms of the contract without you agreeing to it.

&gt;Again, laws are simply not contracts.

Laws are a form of a social contract. The government can't change the laws whenever and however they wish, there are laws that restrict what they can actually do.

&gt;That's not the point...

That was another strawman of yours. You compared a government to the mafia.

The government is elected by the people, and its purpose is to govern.

&gt;Yes, of course they are. That's all they are. The only way government has to uphold laws is by coercion. There is no other way. They are not upheld by voluntary participation... laws are not voluntary.

Laws are a result of the people coming together and deciding what rights and responsibilities they have towards each other. The government did not come up with laws to oppress your freedom or something. I suggest actually studying sociology instead of posting such nonsense on the internet, your posts are below high-school level of ignorant.

&gt;Sure, you can argue that coercion and forced labour is good in certain situations if you want. Doesn't mean it's not coercion or forced labour though.

&gt;I'm sure you could make a somewhat decent case that taxes are good. But that doesn't change the fact that taxes are collected through coercion.

&gt;Do you see how those are two different questions? ""Is taxes coercion?"" and ""are taxes good?"" are two different issues, right?

Taxes are not collected through coercion. You agree to pay appropriate taxes whenever you participate in a transaction. Again, your agreement is automatic, you can always choose not to participate in a transaction if you disagree with the terms.

You are using someone else's infrastructure to perform the transaction. That's your country's infrastructure. It's not your infrastructure. You choose to use it, because you are unable or unwilling to come up with your own way of surviving on this planet. As such, the terms of using that infrastructure are something you have to comply with, until you can function without it.",,/r/europe/comments/8jb0d2/austria_cancels_dual_citizenship_for_people_from/dyzjwsl/,JaB675,1526340673

Some countries require a general election before amendment, and some do not (the US does not, but it is a not uncommon requirement in Europe).  The proportion of legislators that must support a change varies.

**Who interprets a constitution, and how they are selected**

Poland appears to have a constitutional tribunal, independent from the high court.

The US uses the high court, but as far as we know, that court [is theoretically vulnerable to court-packing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Procedures_Reform_Bill_of_1937).

**To what degree can the government use resources to spread ideas among the public?**

Up until recently, the government in the US was prohibited from using the BBG to broadcast domestically in the US.  The UK uses the BBC, which has editorial independence (a phrase that hides a lot of complexity.  Many people claim this, but how is it guaranteed?) to broadcast domestically.  Many countries have domestic stations directly controlled.

**To what degree can the government prohibit ""harmful ideas""?**

It's not just Nazi or communist ideas that Poland doesn't like.  Maybe it's Russian propaganda.  Maybe it's ""fake news"".  Internet censorship is a point of growing popularity.

**Is initiative desirable?  On what points?**

Some people are concerned about the interests of legislators diverging from that of the public.  The [initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative) permits bypassing legislators and submitting a proposed law directly to the public.  (California has this, and I feel like it gets utterly inane laws passed...but some people clearly like it.)

**Is referendum desirable?  On what points?**

One of the very few things on which I think that there is fairly-wide consensus on where referendum is desirable is that a popular referendum -- is desirable when entering or leaving a political union or adopting a constitution.  We did not do that when the US Constitution was first created, partly due to simple pragmatic limitations, but most countries today do in those situations -- it is not the Scottish government that decides on Scottish independence, but the public.  Some countries have a route to cancel legislation via referendum.

**What is the appropriate role for legislative immunity, if any?**

The US extends weak immunity to federal legislators -- they essentially cannot be halted by police and kept from traveling to vote in the legislature.  France extends strong immunity to legislators -- they can commit crimes and cannot be charged while serving as legislators, without a legislative vote to strip them of their immunity.

**How should votes be secured against vote fraud?**

Should I be able to validate that my vote contributed to the final count (which some blockchain advocates would want?)  Is requiring ID from voters objectionable (the US and the UK do not require photo identification, for example) or essential to avoid fraud?  How should votes subject to vote fraud be appealed?  We had a very close vote when electing Bush in 2000, to the point that the technical questions behind the voting mechanism became unexpectedly important, and the Supreme Court ruled to terminate further challenges at a certain point.  But the Supreme Court isn't specifically a ""vote appeal"" authority, which some countries do have.

**What is the legitimate role, if any, of election thresholds?**

[Many countries do not grant political power to marginal parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_threshold), setting a higher minimum than would normally be the case to get one seat in the legislature.  Is this legitimate, or an attempt to exclude upstart, challenger parties?  What thresholds are acceptable?

**[First-past-the-post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting)**

Does it generate a stable, centrist system of coalitions that let people see the package that they will actually be getting after the election before committing to a vote?

Or does it exclude anything but an entrenched elite  that can theoretically collude to exclude other parties?

Subtle choices here have tremendous impact on the political structure of the country; FPTP tends to encourage regional parties, for example, whereas PR does not.

**Access to education**

In much of the world, education is essential for wealth and influence.  Should this be guaranteed, and to what level?  Can it be denied, thereby often providing an in-effect exclusion from power?

In particular, in a democracy, the public takes on some degree of responsibility for guiding the society.  That makes education particularly important...and gives long-term political influence to those who can influence the curriculum.

**Selecting the judiciary**

Appointment?  Election?  Can they be removed?  Are they tied to the party system?

**Legislatures: unicameral or bicameral?**

The US has, at the federal level and in nearly all states, a [bicameral legislative system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism), with two separate houses.  In the federal legislature,  the upper legislative house, the Senate is quite powerful.  In the US, the Senate represents each individual federal state, giving small states as loud a voice as large ones.

In the UK, the upper house, the House of Lords, has had a considerable amount of its authority removed: it can no longer permanently, for example, block legislation, which was one of its important roles in the past.  Because this house represented the aristocracy, its weakening has, I'd guess, more to do with the shift away from aristocracy than specifically a desire not to have a two-house system.

And then there are the [unicameral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicameralism) Nordic countries, with but one legislative house.

**Voting mechanism**

Do I get to vote for one candidate, or do I have a ranked set of choices?  If ranked, which mechanism is used to allocate votes?  Do I have an internal-to-the-party-and-almost-completely-under-its-control-if-it-wants-one primary election, the way the US does, and then a general election with one candidate per party?  Are there multiple rounds, as in France?

Ranked-choice voting, if a bit less-approachable, is a favorite of a lot of people interested in voting, but has some [surprising limitations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem)

These are all things that most of our societies hold to be important one way or another.  And yet...there is a remarkable lack of consensus as to the *right* way to do things, and countries do things in a number of different ways.  Yet most of these are fairly-essential to the basic functioning of democracy.

That's a lot of disagreement about even the basics.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8jao10/opinion_why_are_so_many_democracies_breaking_down/dyzcke6/,vokegaf,1526333198

5224,"&gt; Instead of addressing my argument, you come up with your own version that is easier to attack.


No, i'm using the logic of your argument to show it leads to absurd conclusions. It's called reductio ad absurdum and is a completely legitimate way of demonstrating the logical fallacy of an argument.


If that's not a conclusion that can be drawn from the logic you propose I would like you to explain why not. Just claiming it's a straw man is not an argument.


&gt; and conforming with laws is not equal to supporting slavery.


If slavery is the law... support slavery is per definition conforming with the law. If i'm wrong about that you're gonna have to explain how that is, because I don't get it.


&gt; The terms of the contract are clearly specified in the constitution and the laws of a country.


That's not a contract. And government's change the constitution and break it all the time. Just look at the 2nd amendment in the US, try getting a gun legally in New York. 


&gt; You mean you are ignorant of the law, not that you haven't concented nor agreed to it.


No I mean I haven't consented to it. 


&gt; You concent and agree to it by entering or remaining in the country.


That's not a contract. You can't just assume consent and say you have a contract.


Let me demonstrate. By responding to my previous message you consented to sendign me $100. We now have a contract... so when can I expect payment? No? You're not gonna honor this ""contract""?


&gt; The government is also bound by the same laws


No they're not. Government is enforcing the law and thus there is a clear conflict of interest when the government enforces laws that the government breaks. It doesn't work.


And again, laws are not contracts in any sense of the word. 


&gt; The laws are enforceable, in democratic countries.


That's highly debateable, but doesn't really matter since laws are not contracts. The government can change laws whenever and however they wish... that's not a contract. If you and I sign a contract, I can't just change the terms of the contract without you agreeing to it. 

Again, laws are simply not contracts.


&gt; A democratic country is not equal to the mafia


That's not the point...


&gt; and the laws are not coercion.


Yes, of course they are. That's all they are. The only way government has to uphold laws is by coercion. There is no other way. They are not upheld by voluntary participation... laws are not voluntary.


&gt; You enjoy the benefits of living with certain people, so you have to behave according to their rules and contribute to their society as they see appropriate. That means paying taxes, obeying the law, and serving in the military if you are eligible.


Sure, you can argue that coercion and forced labour is good in certain situations if you want. Doesn't mean it's not coercion or forced labour though.

I'm sure you could make a somewhat decent case that taxes are good. But that doesn't change the fact that taxes are collected through coercion.

5234,"&gt; Iran could always just refuse to start up the nuclear program again and suspend all ballistic missile tests of its own accord.

And why would they do that? Why would a rational actor throw away the ace in the hole willy-nilly?

To demonstrate their goodwill? Everything goodwill has ever gotten anyone from Western powers is either a neoliberal reform regime devastating the economy for loot and profiteering, driving millions into poverty and/or starvation (Latin America, East Asia), or a no fly zone above which tends to very quickly develop into an invasion vector (North and Central Africa).

&gt; North Korea's most effective deterrent is not nukes, it's the conventional artillery aimed at Seoul.

Correct. 

&gt; North Korea does not have a nuclear deterrent for the US, since their missiles can't reach the mainland.

Firstly, that's not how nuclear deterrence works. In fact. not at all, but I won't get into that right now. 

Secondly and more importantly, North Korea's nukes were never meant to be a deterrent, as you correctly pointed out by mentioning their capability of shelling Seoul into a smoldering ruin within minutes if needs be. The nukes were meant as a bargaining chip to bring the US and its allies to the negotiating table and get a few concessions out of them. So far, it has worked quite splendidly.

At the same time Europe could put pressure on Israel not to act before any attack happens. Maybe try bringing some Arab states to enforce it. There seems to be a change of mood regarding Palestine.

For too many letters in transliteration there are usually three reasons:

1. Write as you speak, speak as you write just like in Croatian. Take your example of McDonald's: In English you pronounce it as Mack-DON-uhldz, so Georgian adds 'a' - the 'ა' to the word. The final letter is 'ი' - the English 'e' because that's the nominative case marker for that word.
2. Because of one sound = one letter, sounds only have one symbol to denote them, unlike some languages that have to combine some symbols for a sound. For example take English 'ch' and German 'tsch' which in Georgian would be just 'ჩ' or 'sh' for 'შ,' 'ts'' for 'წ' etc.,

3. Consonant clusters: Georgian is famous for it's consonant clusters which in some extreme cases can get up to 8 word initial consonants and when transliterated look even scarier. for example take a 3 consonant initial word 'ცხვირი' (nose) transliterated to English 'tskhviri,' looks scary, doesn't it? or a word with 8 word initial consonants 'გვფრცქვნის' as 'gvpʰrts'kʰvnis, now that's intimidating.

5473,"&gt;You don't choose whether you're a minority. That's not how it works.

Lol, how not? If you're born gay, you're automatically a minority in the whole world. If you're born black in Spain, you're a minority in Spain. Etc.

&gt;What are you talking about? There are two definitions of nation. [...]

It's funny becaue when you argue to some constitutionalists about the national matter they argue that the term ""nationality"" that is included in the Constitution was meant as an euphemism, and as such we do have in fact our nation recognised.

And then you argue with others and they tell you that, not even if 90% of your people agree with it, you don't get it.

You clearly positioned yourself as someone who argues that people shouldn't be what they consider themselves to be, but that this must be imposed. So I'd ask you to reconsider that part of your ideology, because it's essentially unfair.

&gt;What you tried wasn't to get ""your nation recognised"". You tried to secede.

I was talking about the Estatute as the parting point of this whole journey.

90% of the Parliament approved an Estatute and 80% of the people endorsed it in a popular referendum, and then it was mocked by PSOE and PP.

You can't really expect a country to work under those assumptions, to dismiss what 90% of people over a territory agree upon.

&gt;That's ironic. You're literally making the same point I am, but you don't seem to realize it applies to your side? You have rights and liberties, yet you yell ""oppression"" every chance you get. If that's not unperceived privilege, I don't know what is.

It is!

And it's *exhausting*.

And that's exactly as it happens with every other minority fight.

*i.e. Feminism pushes are either perceived by the general public as people pushing for privileges for women, or understood as women seeking equality. And you can't really convince people otherwise, it's very much of a worldview. Peopel rarely switch sides.*

That is, btw, the reason why dialogue isn't possible, because we're parting from two different realities, with people that enjoy something they never have had to challenge or think about (their nation recognised), with people that are trying to gain that same status.

I do sometimes wonder how it has to be, to have an Estate. It must be really freeing to know that you have no more ruling you that don't recognise your reality.","Yes, I'm an independentist",/r/europe/comments/8jam6s/quim_torra_set_to_become_new_president_of_the/dyyoeqm/,Erratic85,1526311391

5577,"All things considered that's a pretty ignorant statement since 'cultural appropriation' in and of itself merely is a technical term that describes a specific process **without** a connotation.

Just like we speak of [artistic appropriation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_(art\)) or [musical appropriation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_(music\)) we can speak of *cultural* appropriation which, at its core, is taking an element from an 'original' culture and incorporating it into one's own.

If we would just take the word in its original meaning this isn't something negative at all with everyone doing it all over the world, all the time - simply because communication leads to exchange and exchange leads to ""appropriating"" elements that weren't a part previously.

This misunderstanding is best solved by a quote from the above article for *artistic* appropriation which explains the academic context of the word:

&gt;**Inherent in our understanding of appropriation is the concept that the new work recontextualizes whatever it borrows to create the new work.**

This recontextualization (which also can be referred to as a *mis*appropriation) is where issues can pop up when it comes to culture.

A simple case are kids playing Cowboys &amp; Indians which is, at it's core, an example of a culture being appropriated. The reason we don't talk about it is because it's completely unharmful in this form since we usually tell our kids eventually in some form that that's not how 'Americans' behave today and explain the **original context** of where it is coming from.

Without this context we'd raise a generation of kids who might genuinely be led to believe that that's what the US looks like today (which is already bad) or a generation that wouldn't believe someone can be American if he's not a stereotypical Cowboy or Indian (which is *really* bad).

____

Now, in this specific case, analogue to the Cowboys &amp; Indians example, I'd like to think this is a non-issue since, just like the people doing the appropriating in that case, people are all in all well-enough informed about Japan and the **original context** of the elements used that a fear of misappropriation is out of place here.

In the exact same scenario when it comes to for example cultural elements of Inuits or Sami people then I'd see this differently since those are much less exposed to the world and there is a real danger of the original context being lost due to the new and recontextualized representation of their culture.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/8jant4/eurovision_israel_winner_netta_accused_of/dyyhdsq/,rEvolutionTU,1526304221

5612,"&gt;You aren't offering any basis for their similarity. There's all forms of physical harm.

Circumcision may not be the most lethal thing (though there is a constant rate of fatalities), but it is still most definitely physical harm. A skin bundled with nerves is slit aside for the child to life with for eternity. This is not as unimportant as you claim it to be. 

&gt;Don't think so. Pretty sure most countries don't regulate it and many permit minors to get them in puberty. 

Do your research, then. Cyprus\*, Denmark, Finland\*\*, France, Germany\*, Greece, Italty\*, Portugal are just some of the countries that have banned underage tattoos. 

\*= Family permit is accepted if 16 or 17   
\*\*= Apparently Finland requires governmental permit 

And I'm pretty positive that scarring your kid falls under physical abuse, so you have to give me some examples on ""legal scarring"". However even if there's some obscure religious scarring allowed (it shouldn't be), this doesn't make circumcision any better. 

&gt;Because I sure as didn't say that a child has no will in reality 

I don't think you understood my point correctly. I'll explain it, again. 

Children are legally not decision makers, they don't have a say in most issues. 

This is because children are both (usually) ignorant but also their brains haven't stopped developing. While it is true that brain doesn't stop developing at a notable rate til mid 20s, it's not comparable to the amount of development through your teens. 

Therefore, what a child has to say in circumcision is irrelevant, and this point is invalid: 

&gt;&gt;just because a kid wants it doesn't mean we should let it

 &gt;Why not? As long as their parents consent to it, why shouldn't they be able to? 

&amp;nbsp; 

&gt;It really is. Confirmed by the hundreds of millions alive and functioning today 

Functioning &amp; alive does not confirm anything. It even goes against your ""16 year olds drinking"" example, because they're also alive and functioning. 

Again; it does not confirm anything. A very sensitive part of your body is slit off. The child is branded as a Jew/Muslim (Except in the US), and he had no say in losing that very sensitive tissue. You can not leave permanent marks on your child for a non-pragmatic reason. Period. It's bodily harm.  

So far your argument has been ""it's not that bad so why ban it?"". ""Not that bad"" isn't good enough. It's not acceptable to lose a sensitive part of your body just because your parents believed in some God. It's abuse. 

And for the record; do you also think FGM is okay? 

&gt;You're presenting a tautology, rather than saying why this is correct. 

I don't think I need to explain to you why harming your child is a bad thing. It's not a tautology; the explanation comes with the statement: Harming your child for no apparent rational reason is a crime and furthermore it's immoral. And that's because harming your child is a bad thing unless you're doing it for the greater good. (Greater good in this context refers to an actual greater good, not morality points from God) 

&gt;I actually can see the difference. Teaching kids fundamentalist religious stuff is waaaaaay more dangerous than circumcising them. They for some reason you don't find this kind of mental harm a problem. 

Hate speech is already banned. We have laws against ""mental harm"". Your point is null and void. 


&gt;&gt;That's not a political statement. 

&gt;Neither is messing with your kid's dick.

The foundational text of Catalan nationalism, Prat de la Riba's The Catalan Nation (1906) says it loud and clear: Catalans are culturally superior to non-catalans and the fate of an independent Catalonia is to destroy Spain and substitute Castile as the hegemonic culture in the Peninsula.

5736,"Yeah, those are the fringe violent nuts that exist everywhere under every government. These people would be violent no matter what, they'd just find a different excuse for it. There wouldn't be a significant increase in violent nuts in Europe if it was a single state. 

People like this make up only a very little percentage of the overall population, even if there are people who actually agree with their violent views because there's a huge difference between being actively violent or just an internet bitching racist for example, one of these being way more convenient, less dangerous, and with very little potential punishment from the law.

Again, I think you are massively overselling what the people are actually willing to do about their government, especially if the government actually makes their country work reasonably efficiently. And I mean the majority of people, not right wing radical nuts.

Again you're just preaching your ignorance. For starters, the military has no use for somebody entering their 40s and consequently folk can't be conscripted at 41 (except under mobilization ofc). The person in question would be missing the roll call, not service itself and would have administrative/bureaucracy issues, not face immediate conscription. And those living abroad rarely face enforcement of these laws as long as they don't stay in the country for over 6 months, at which point it's assumed that they're living here and therefore don't get expat status.

The former because any structures in front of the walls makes it difficult for artillery (of any kind, simply anything that is capable of shoot projectiles at walls or a gate and damage it) to hit outer walls or gates, the latter because of the moats and ditches countering any digging attempts. You can still use previous era features like barbicans or modify them depending on what you are likely to be facing in case of a siege.

And now that cultural appropriation has become the new black and all the rage in the sphere of societal sensitivity, the herd mentality has developed the notion that all sorts of borrowing from foreign cultures  is inherently immoral and vile by default without room for nuance or context. Thus according to this flawed logic, it follows that all acts of borrowing from other cultures - especially from those that are conventionally seen as ""unprivileged"" or those that are simply non-caucasian - are amoral cultural appropriation.

I won't challenge the main body but I will go into the special circumstance of kids: The body of law you speak of _assumes_ in most cases that children can't have any will of their own. This creates a situation where the subject in question has all these supposed rights but no will to exercise any of them (and in many cases be protected by them). The fight is over who has the privilege to exercise the will of the child on their behalf until they are deemed to have their own. Consequently, the state/society figuratively opt to put the child on ice where prevention of any perceived harm whatsoever is the goal. What the state is doing isn't protecting the child's rights but rather its _future_ rights because the child may very well decide against the state's ""protection"" in the future.

One thing that happened is that they upped the penalties and procedures in 2015's ""gag-law"", allegedly created to help fight religious terrorism, but that in the end served to give further privileges to police corps and ways to control society harder, promoting self-censure in people.

Cases like these are meant to be 'made an example', so that people self-censure and it stops happening. That's why all the rappers made the support video and song, to prove that they won't be prosecuted for it —because justice has, in fact, a political agenda through the state prosecutors.

For an example, what happens with Pablo Hasel is that they're calling for a 2 year and 1 day sentence.

5959,"I live in basically the Tourist Mecca, and the fact of the matter here is that **if you stop dodging taxes like AirBnB does** you end up with the same prices.

Not only that, this type of industry fucked up Amsterdam's real estate even more because now we have one rich dude that just rents out houses via these apps and doesn't pay taxes by not registering it as a hotel, whereas actual residents of the city are pushed aside and make way for tourists.

Now we have a law that requires you to make your room comply with the same regulations as a hotel room (not hard to do at all but amazingly some do not) but also **pay. your damn. taxes.** because you are renting out property. Lo and behold, the prices are pretty much the same.",LusoFrench citizen living in the Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/8j3odx/madrid_prepares_to_ban_almost_all_airbnbstyle/dyy6i88/,RafaRealness,1526283839

5962,"Sure, if you don't mind sleeping with the local rats.

I've been travelling a lot the past few years (covered nearly all of Europe) and the reason why we choose airbnb is because we can get a full flat in pristine condition with everything we will ever need for those few days, for the same price we'd get a small and basic hotel room and in some cases **hostel** (looking at you Amsterdam) room.

Sure i agree it's creating problems and i'm very skeptical about using it but let's not hide the truth about incredibly high hotel prices.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8j3odx/madrid_prepares_to_ban_almost_all_airbnbstyle/dyy6io9/,ergotbrew,1526283864

My English GCSE lessons in the 90's really were lacking from a grammar standpoint. It really hit home when I started learning Swedish and it's grammar, which then showed how I didn't have a clue about grammar. ",,/r/europe/comments/8j6nlk/wtf_duolingo/dyy6ivm/,JamDunc,1526283877
