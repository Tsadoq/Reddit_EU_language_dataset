15,"The EU’s foreign policy is inadequate to the task of keeping Europe safe in today’s world of great power politics and uncertainty.
Over the last five years, trust between Brussels and member states dwindled, and policy came to reflect the lowest common denominator of popular opinion.
The coming five years herald acute pressure on Europe, particularly as Russia, China, and the US undermine multilateral institutions and treat trade, finance data, and security guarantees as instruments of power rather than global public goods.
The new high representative should move quickly to rewire European foreign policymaking to exercise strategic sovereignty.
The high representative needs more support on this strategy – from deputies, special representatives, and foreign ministers tasked with specific roles.
The new leadership team in Brussels needs to reoperationalise European defence, build Europe’s self-sufficiency through a strong European pillar in NATO, and consider innovations such as a European Security Council.
Europe will only build greater unity by tackling controversial issues head on in the European Council and the Foreign Affairs Council.

We are expected to pay for shipping in post office- we don’t pay anything driving. The maintenance is from our tax dollars. Government can only “lose” money in highways.

No, its just the standard right wing extreme propaganda. 

He lies over and over again, like this sub likes it.

All these papers have close ties to SD politicians. Literally being created and run by SD people.

Take this lie for example:

&gt;Nyheter Idag I don't read since it always come across as a pale imitation of the others but it's founder Frick was kicked out of SD for leaking information and internal videos to the aforementioned far-leftist org Expo

First of all, EXPO is in no way even left wing, they just cover right wing extreme movements. They have right wingers on the board.

Also, there are leaked emails of Frick telling SD-politicians that the paper is loyal to the party, and then going through the strategy to get SD more support.

&gt; was created as basically a blog answer to a very pernicious Expressen (one of our largest mainstream papers) strategy known as white-pixelling where they wanted to use mosaic:ed pictures of criminals but decided, ""to prevent racism"", to photoshop their skin colour to look white first. 

The idea of ""white pixeling"" was never a thing, it was made up to get idiots to believe in a conspiracy. The most common ""example"" of it that was posted years back was fake.

&gt;the semi-disgraced Ekeroth (removed from holding down political positions

It took them like 10 years (!) of racist scandals before he was removed. 

&gt;Nor were there ever any open gestures to the KKK

&gt;the party's cleanup of all skinheads happened in 1994

&gt;totally unrelated nazi front meeting which got her and her husband kicked out of SD by Jansson. Åkesson et al had no need to purge any of those clowns


I dont even know were to begin here. We are talking about hundreds of nazi scandals over the last few years. NOT only back in the early 90´s. 

Åkesson joined a well known open neo-nazi party, and pretty much everyone at the top is connected to neo-nazis or white nationalists.

Here are some of their still top politicians.

146,"&gt;So what you say is actually true. 

Yes. The deal between the government and the DB is that the DB pays for the infrastructure (tax money is added though) and the government pays for the infrastructure as soon as it's broken. So the DB just let thinks to break down because the government pays.

Another reason for the terrible infrastructure in Germany is politics: it should actually be part of the sources I gave you as well, but as far as I remember a politician just shortened down the number of railways because they costed money. The effect was devastating: those railroads weren't ""too much"" but were actually used against traffic jams, broken trains, detour and so on. That is the reason why the system is broken now: there is just not enough railroad for important purposes.

&gt; The DB is reliant on tax money and mostly state-owned.

The DB Is state-owned (not in parts but in total). BUT some politicians thought it was a great idea to make it into a ""private company"" owned by the state. So it's a joint-stock company with the government as the only shareholder. Ask literally any economist why this is totally bullshit. You basically get the worst out of both worlds: a company that makes money for the top managers (capitalism) with money you don't earn (socialism) and no competition to drive innovation and lower costs (socialism). 

It would be much better if it had stayed public or got privatized (warning! privatization should be done in an ordoliberal way AKA there should be enough train companies to make a fair competition).

I don't think that they earn too little money. Data shows that they actually make enough money. But the money is paid to the top managers and is wasted on corruption (just look at Stuttgart 21). And a lot of money is lost on terrible decisions like buying burning buses in the UK to drive them in a town in Spain where they are too large to fit in the streets and burn down all the time anyway - that would not have happened in a publicly owned or privately owned company. Such things only happen when you are a private company who can't go bankrupt.",,/r/europe/comments/covht7/deutsche_bahn_german_rail_nailing_the_ad_for/ewnb73y/,Antogonissimus,1565573494

* the prices will go up (which is a disadvantage to everyone who has to pay them, businesses and especially the common UK folks), and it is therefore a reasonable strategy to stockpile goods
* it is highly doubtful that the advantages of a sinking pound would even compensate a fraction of the drawbacks (*especially* with the economical segmentation of the UK, where a low pound doesn't really help much)
* those who get most to feel the disadvantages of the nosedive of the pound and the increasing prices (and thus have most motivation to stockpile goods) are rarely the same as those who get to feel most its advantages.

314,"You still need to have a large sample size. But how large the population is doesn't really matter. A 2000 person sample is about as accurate for a large city as it is a large country as it is the entire world.

Think about this situation: I run a company that makes dice. Each die should hypothetically roll a 6 one sixth of the time. I make about 100,000 dice a year. I roll 6000 of them to test. Hypothetically, I'm gonna get 1000 sixes, but in reality, it'll be more like 975 or something, and get a number slightly different from 1/6.

Now imagine the next year I instead made a billion dice, and do the same test, again with 6000 dice.

I'm going to get the exact kind of results as before. I'm rolling the same number of dice, and the dice haven't changed, so the results are going to be just as accurate as before. I'm just as likely to get 975 instead of 1000 now as before.

What this (hopefully) shows is that what determines the accuracy of a sample isn't how big the original population is. Would a larger sample be slightly more accurate? Of course. But the UK being big doesn't really change the accuracy of the sample. 2000 people is a good sample size for a large city, a country, or even the entire world - just like how rolling 6000 random dice won't change, no matter how many there are in the world.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/covyym/brits_choose_spain_as_number_one_dream_location/ewmqaxl/,sandpecker,1565557880

Those random villages are probably the costumers keeping the train afloat and profitable. It’s not about fastness as much as profitable. You could have a fast train that connected from LA to NYC with no stops. But obviously that would fail and having stops where you transport people from the cities and villages in between would work better as in total the average train probably carries more than 600% the capacity from start to end.

&amp;#x200B;

The US 8th AF compiled a report into their own accuracy in the period September - December 1944. They found the most common type of attack they carried out was using H2X radar through heavy cloud cover. 94.4% of bombs dropped using this method fell more than 1 mile from the aiming point. More than 60% of bombs fell more than 3 miles from the aiming point.

&amp;#x200B;

The USAAF might have called this ""precision"" bombing and claimed it was aimed at a particular factory, but the reality is it was a city area raid, and they were conducted using large proportions of incendiaries. 

&amp;#x200B;

What the Luftwaffe pioneered, and both the RAF and USAAF copied, was the tactic of using masses of incendiaries to bomb city centres to cause the maximum amount of damage to housing and infrastructure. As the German orders for Coventry put it: wiping out the most densely populated worker's settlements will hinder reconstruction and the resumption of manufacturing.

&gt; Japan at that period had a debt crisis where interest rates hit 0 so a recession could no longer be prevented by just rolling over the debt with lower interest rates. 

This makes no sense. Japan had a very high interest rate in 1990, and that is what cause them to hit a recession. But the EU has a very low interest rate, even talking about getting a negative interest rate. It's a great time for the EU to take in as much debt as possible.

This isn't just my idea by the way. The 75-100 year debt storm where interest rates hit 0 and the game changes is an idea pushed by people like Larry Summers, Ray Dalio, Hank Paulson etc.

If you look at every recession since the Great Depression to the Financial Crisis, both the EU and the US has been able to end them by lowering interest rates by 5% more or less. The only 2 times in the past 100 years that has happened was the 1930's and 2008-2010. Japan had that happen in the 1990s, I don't remember the exact year, but they did it. They also managed it terribly and their debt/GDP compounded to ridiculous levels so there are some differences between how the EU and US handled theirs thankfully.

&gt;but at the cost of a lot of economic slowness in the southern countries.

Debatable. I'd argue the austerity policy successfully got the debt growth under control, but it did cause a very large economic slowdown that was not necessary. The US managed to balance inflationary and deflationary policies better so our income to debt repayments managed to get better without such a large pullback.

Granted, I'd argue that countries like Portugal have too strong of a currency/debt burden relative to how productive they are and need a different level of the Euro vs. Germany or the Netherlands.

616,"&gt; USA isn't a fascist country

What exactly makes one a ""fascist"" country?

&gt; Fascism (/ˈfæʃɪzəm/) is a form of radical right-wing, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and of the economy.

That's the opening line of Wikipedia's definition from [these sources](https://i.imgur.com/EWu62ja.png). I personally think that's a fair definition of the word, maybe you don't.

Is the US ""radical,"" maybe? Things like the Tea Party and now the Alt-Right holding the highest of offices and contributing to the judicial make up. But maybe that makes the US not radical anymore since it's mainstream? Is it radical in the global sense? Maybe?

Is the US ""right-wing,"" yes.

Is the US authoritarian ultranationalistic, maybe? Jingoism is the accepted norm in America. Children are having their skulls bashed in for not saying removing their baseball hats for the national anthem. Children are forced to pledge allegience to the United States every morning in school. There's always been [a big push to ban the burning of the American flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_Desecration_Amendment) which has been put into law across the country at the federal and state level.

Is the US ""characterized by dictatorial power,"" [maybe](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746)?

Does the US forcibly suppress opposition? The US is ranked [""problematic"" for journalists](https://www.npr.org/2019/04/18/714625907/the-u-s-now-ranks-as-a-problematic-place-for-journalists). The [Obama](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/16/whistleblowers-double-standard-obama-david-petraeus-chelsea-manning) and [Trump](https://www.cjr.org/politics/trump-leaker-arrest-natalie-mayflower-sours-edwards.php) administrations continue the country's long history of prosecuting whistleblowers. We can also talk about the red scare, Muslim bans, voting suppression, etc.

&gt; and strong regimentation of society and of the economy.

[According to the Cato Institute](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/human-freedom-index-files/human-freedom-index-2018-revised.pdf), a right-wing libertarian think tank, the US has one of the worst personal freedom rankings of all western countries (28th in the world).

&gt;  and strong regimentation ... of the economy.

I think this is where the US could fail to fit the perfect definition of fascism if you look at it from a more liberal viewpoint where less government = good. But also maybe not because of the view that if you take power away from the people and give it to the corporations, maybe that's what the government wants. Is that a backwards way of getting strong regimentation of the economy?

To me, I think the US, if you took a liberal definition of all those scenarios could fit the definition of fascism.",,/r/europe/comments/covdtm/how_italys_most_powerful_politician_is_creating_a/ewluwp8/,basscorruption,1565536510

637,"I guess it is wrong :) a little bit (or maybe ""bigly"") exaggerated. Thanks for the comment, bc the post made me think a little more about the punctuality claims of DB: They claim ~75% of trains are on time (according to their definition of 6 mins), hence ~25% are delayed. However, this does not reflect the customer experience, since they often need to change trains. 

For example I commute weekly and need to change once, hence 2 trains. If I apply now binomial distribution (cd), asking for the probability that none of these trains is delayed, I calculate a punctuality probability of ~56% of the trains are on time. 

Honestly, I'm so surprised by the results, because this reflects totally my experience. I always was wondering why these DB provided 75% do not resonate with my gut feeling.

Now, this blows my mind: if DB would adopt a more common standard where the train is considered only as punctual if it arrived within 3 minutes of the scheduled time, the percentage drops fast below the 50% punctuality threshold.

663,"&gt; and ""feminist economy"" - it's so hilarious and inane it cannot help but attract mockery

Have looked up what it actually stands for?

&gt; Feminist economics (...) argues that because modern economics is built around the idea of the “economic man”, it is ideologically weighted towards normalising men’s lives and subsequently ignores the experience of women. For instance, the typical “economic man” works to earn himself an income, engages in traditional market transactions and spends his money selfishly on consumption goods. This individual does not do any housework or have any caring responsibilities, and he certainly doesn’t give birth! As a result, models which are based on “economic man” cannot be expected to understand or even notice gender inequalities, let alone create policies to alleviate them.

&gt; Importantly, traditional economic models also provide an incomplete picture of what affects men’s lives, since men’s existence also depends on unpaid work, on production for direct use and on care, and many men are involved in these activities too. A broader conception of what constitutes “the economy” is clearly needed, with the current system – under mainstream economics – dependent for its continued existence on many activities that lie outside of its scope.

849,"As someone who's regularly travelling to Alsace, I'd say the whole region is pretty touristy. There are plenty of beautiful villages, castles, landscapes, amazing historical sites and so on. Therefore it's really not a surprise that some places can get awfully and sometimes unpleasantly overcrowded, especially in summer and early autumn when lots of people have holidays and there are wine festivals and so on. Out of season (late autumn, spring) it gets a lot calmer. But regardless of that, if you're in the area Colmar is still always worth a visit I'd say. It has a beautiful old town, a more village-esque flair than Strassburg and the Unterlinden museum is definitely worth a visit too (The Isenheimer Altarpiece there is a proto-psychedelic masterpiece for me). 
Really close to Colmar there's the beautiful but normally ridiculously crowded and touristy village of Eguisheim. But from there you could also quickly reach the nearby mountains with lots of medieval castles up there of which some are very touristy and some seem to be completely abandoned and mostly left alone. More touristy and crowded but still very beautiful places are Kaysersberg, Ribeauvillé and Riquewihr and the Haut Koenigsburg in the area between Colmar and Strassburg. 
If you want to go to (usually) slightly less crowded places that are worth a visit in the same area I'd suggest going to places like Turckheim, Hunawihr, Bergheim, Andlau and Dambach-la-Ville instead. There's also the Mont Saint Odile near Strasburg which I absolutely recommend to get up there for the view and then walk through the forests to discover the ""pagan walls"" there.

850,"i think marx's strength is in his incredible critique of capitalism. He forsaw capitalist crises, he predicted they would grow in severity each time. He explained why armies of unemployed people are necessary to create a downward pressure on wages. He perfectly described overproduction and unequal distribution. He passionately describes, perhaps as one of the first, the process of alienation, how competition on the workforce divides people and so organizations and creates internal conflict, nepotism and misunderstanding and how it distantiates us from our natural cooperative nature.  I mean Marx is one of the most important political commentators to have ever lived, it is a shame to see tyrants have such success presenting his ideology if it was their own and always adding in some fucked up totalitarian military component. 

Calling the vast amount of writings Marx left us, saying he had a *daydream* is a gross understatement of the value of his work. 

It is easy to spot people that havent actually read any Marx, they lament about his ideas for communism while in reality for the most part he wrote about the pitfalls of capitalism, for which he is often lauded.

The funny thing is, capitalism is already developing a bastardized form of communism which is being rolled out by AI high frequency trading algorithms that have effectively given our economy to machines, a perfect technocracy in which no human interaction is needed or warranted for the purchase or sale of (financial) products and which is only fixated on monopolized short term interests. At one point humans wont go and purchase stock but it will be done by hyper efficient bots that can trade many times faster and process data many times faster than a human being, then it will be delivered by a selfdriving truck. This will greatly improve distribution of goods, and one could say the only difference would be that the technocracy is fueled by narrow private interests of capitalists instead of the narrow private interests of the communist vanguard.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/coumis/farright_conference_in_lisbon_draws_hundreds_on/ewlfzes/,dapperedodo,1565522473

902,"&gt;And yet the supply route was not enough, because Finland blocked the supply routes over land
The Soviet Union never asked Finland to let supplies through in accordance to the treaties concerning blockades/siege warfare. According to the contemporary laws of war, neutral shipments (non-armed, marked with the Red Cross) would have to be allowed at request, and they would have been subject to search by the blockading force for any contraband (ie. anything not food and medicines).

Finland itself had no food to spare due to the Soviet-caused famine of 1941-1942 (the Treaty of Moscow of 1940, ie. Winter War peace treaty obligated the Soviet Union to sell Finland wheat at global market prices, but they violated it and never sold any during the Interim Peace, despite Finnish purchase requests), so supplying Leningrad just out of benevolence was completely out of question - and even modern laws of war don't require the blockading force to share its own supplies to the blockaded territory.

&gt;Obviously other supplies were required as well
Yet only food and medicines is what even the current laws of war consider necessary. Of course the Stavka wanted to keep their war efforts going by supplying the city with ammo, but that worsened the famine, in comparison to supplying only food and medicines.

&gt;Stop blaming the victims
I'm not blaming the victims, I'm blaming Stalin, who deliberately left the people there knowing the city would be surrounded by Finland on its northern border and German forces at south. The Soviet officials tried to prevent that by starting the evacuation in time, but Stalin explicitly forbad that until evacuation through the main routes was no longer feasible.

1194," The article was originally in Spanish, for those who don't know, VOX is an extremist right wing party in Spain and the ""procés"" in the process in which Catalonia wants the independance from Spain. Here is a tranlation of the article:

\---

VOX and the Catalan ""procés"" are in principle antagonistic elements and impossible conciliation. However, according to journalist David Alandete, they have factors in common, behind which are Russia, and their eagerness to destabilize Europe.

In an interview with Efe on the occasion of the publication of his book ""Fake news. The new weapon of mass destruction"" (Deusto), Alandete affirms that ""Russia has dedicated hundreds of millions of euros annually to the large public disinformation media destined abroad as they are Russia Today (RT) Sputnik. ""

""RT and Sputnik validate points of view that go against the balance of traditional power and politics that Spain has maintained in recent years,"" based on the NATO plus EU model, or what is the same: Europe more transatlantic axis, stands out.

""I think that VOX is in the orbit of Russia, in particular of United Russia,"" the party of the president of that country, Vladimir Putin, ""a far-right, nationalist and closely linked to the Orthodox Church.""

Although Alandete acknowledges that VOX has denied it several times ""and is entitled to do so,"" he says ""Russia wants to continue having an approach"" to them.

Regarding the Catalan ""procés"", to all the trajectory that Catalan indepentism has maintained in recent times and that crystallizes in the illegal referendum of October 1, 2017, Alandete points out that Putin has used it for his own benefit, particularly in cases like the one in Crimea.

In this sense, Alandete recounts in his book an episode starring Putin on October 19, 2019 in the so-called ""Valdái Forum"", known as the ""Russian Davos"".

On that occasion, says Alandete, the Russian president referred to the Catalan case and said that ""the situation in Spain shows how fragile stability can be even in a prosperous and established state.""

""Putin compared Catalonia with Crimea,"" the Ukrainian province that Russia annexed unilaterally in 2014 and has never been recognized by the international community, says Alandete.

At the same time, says the journalist, the Russian president ""admitted that the case of Catalonia was an excuse to remind Europe that at the time it recognized the"" unilateral independence of Kosovo (something that neither Spain nor Ukraine did), but ""at the same time did not recognize Crimea. ""

""Russia has not invented Catalan independence, as British hatred of the EU and xenophobia in Central Europe were not invented."" What it does is take advantage of these circumstances for its own benefit, he emphasizes.

And for this, says Alandete, Russia will not hesitate to use all the media battery of RT and Sputnik to spread ""fake news"" about the Catalan case, such as a headline with which first of them opened its website on October 28, 2017: ""Tanks in the streets of Barcelona. Spain and Catalonia on the verge of a violent outcome"".

But the matter gets tangled up even more when characters like Steve Bannon, former campaign chief of US President Donald Trump, and then White House political strategist, charge of which he was fired seven months later, break in.

Bannon, who is investigated for his alleged role in Russia's alleged intervention in the 2016 presidential elections that led Trump to the White House, has since dedicated himself to setting up a kind of ""international right-wing populism club"" to put together a Eurosceptic front before the elections to the European Parliament on May 26.

Alandete argues that Bannon believes that ""there is room to strengthen the nation-state and attack internationalism"", nutritional ideas of all those right-wing populist parties, some of which have already reached the government, such as Law and Justice in Poland or the League in Italy.

""Bannon hopes that VOX will help choose the right Spanish political life on the right. Don't underestimate him, because he helped Trump win the elections,"" says Alandete.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/coth3t/the_journalist_david_alandete_places_russia/ewl41o8/,TheGabnor,1565504959

You either need a hunters license (passing some theoretical and practical tests) or be having been an active member of a gun club for a while (most have guns you can borrow while at the range, and give safety training etc). Once you get a gun license they won't revoke it if you stop hunting or leave the club though, but it's pretty restricted where you can use legally use it and carrying in public is not a thing,  neither is  getting a gun license just for ""self defense"".

1234,"To summarize: Heirless property, whether Polish or not, in Poland and in every other country falls to the state, so in Poland, to the Polish state.  Owners, Jewish or Polish, who wish to claim their property must prove it was theirs in the courts.  If they can't prove it because of the war started by Germany, or because of deliberate destruction done by Germans, whereby documents and proof of ownership were destroyed, that grievance goes to Germany.  Poland will not give property to people based on say so.  Poland has no obligation to give property or money to self proclaimed Jewish Claims groups from America or elsewhere.  Germany, by the way paid billions to Jewish groups already for loss of Jewish property in German OCCUPIED territories which would include Polish territory occupied by Germany.  Poles paying for this would be paying for something paid for already.  Meanwhile Poland did not get paid by Germany for loss of property.  Poland has survivors of German genocide that need to be cared for.  Israel and Jewish groups got money from Germany to do that.  Poland and Polish groups did not get much money from Germany for Polish victims.  Poland fought the Germans on all fronts.  Jewish American organizations did nothing for European Jews during WW II, and should not be now the recipients of money in the name of Polish Jews.  Communist Poland paid monies to the US and many other countries for properties nationalized by the Soviet imposed Communist regime which btw imprisoned, tortured and killed Poles.  Who will give restitution to the Poles and their families who were imprisoned, tortured and killed?  While the US gives Israel billions of dollars for who knows what, Poland helped cause the downfall of Communism and all it got was a few million from the US to help get on its feet and it gave that money back.  Meanwhile it did a service to the US by weakening a dangerous rival.  This JUST Act is not Just at all and does not put these Jewish groups in a good light, and neither do the 88 senators who are pushing this extortion looking good, and they do a disservice to all the other Jews who have no part in this disgusting attempt to extract money from the Polish victims of genocide.",,/r/europe/comments/cmgw96/us_senators_want_poland_to_pay_victims_of_nazi/ewkv62a/,Deebaytor,1565495592

As Russian I can explain this without any problem.

Like, then I'm talking with, for example, my mom, main argument is ""I don't want to repeat 90's"".   
Also, there is anouther problem - we don't have any real opposition, like there is pretty popular Navalny, but all 40+ population believe what he is proUSA and will sell country if become president. And almost all other opposition is not better, there isn't anybody who really have chances vs Putin.

1596,"Now that you mention it I remember a class I took on religion's history in politics and governance. It talked about what was called the Protestant paradox. 

Protestantism was supposed to be a return to Christianisty's roots and a movement that was much more fundamentalist than the Catholic church that had gone off the deep end. Basically its core principles was the establishment of private faith and a rejection of organized religion, a determinism around the original sin that created the existentialist crisis as we know it, and a push to make Man more involved in the world as a compliance with God's wish to have Mankind shaping the world and thus prove worthy of being made in his image. 

This lead to a much more personal faith that fostered millions of different interpretations which pushed religion out of politics as it was relegated to the private realm in order to avoid conflicts of interpretations. The more involved in the world purpose of Man also lead to a glorification of Mankind and a progressive rejection of God and his influence in the world. It's this sentiment that created deism and the belief that a higher power exist but has absolutely no interest in interacting with mankind, the same way men don't care about ants. 

In the end this glorification and progressive estrangement from God created a movement centered on humankind refusing God's authority and existence as well as promoting self-determination regardless of religion. This also introduced the idea that religion was just an opinion and paved the way to freedom of faith. 

This centering on Mankind created the idea of Nation to assemble a people around one core identity which was not faith. As such, the Church became redundant and left to the side. 

So in the end, a desire to return to a purer Faith and stronger religion lead to secularism and the rejection of the existence of God.

This would explain why Protestant countries are more receptive to secularism and atheism as these concepts are a direct continuation of their faith.

Seen under that light, it makes perfect sense. Thank you for your insight.

Extra information: 

* there were quite a few portuguese in the crew, namely the captain
* the original point of the voyage was to reach the east by going west, the circumnavigation part was due to extraordinary circumstances
* portugal didn't want the expedition to happen because it would undercut portugal's routes to the east indies
* that's why Magalhães was denied money in portugal and made him go  ask the spanish (very similar to columbus, actually)

And, as I mentioned in my previous comment, Magalhães had already been in the area sooo... he was first. The slave was well. :P Maybe you can say Elcano was the first spanish to circumnavigate the world, or the first person to do it in one mission.

1761,"&gt;democracy is ineffective but what makes you think that a corrupt oligarchy would be better?

It's not ""either democracy or corrupt oligarchy"". It's closer to ""democracy or rapid transition to better society"". The reason I say this is because it would only really be a temporary measure - the authoritarian control - it would be temporary until the richest, most powerful people were unable to influence such policies. First, there would be a huge number of policies enacted quickly with no way to prevent them, like wealth distribution, free healthcare etc. After a significant number of years (a few decades) there could be a period of transition to a society where there the power is put in the hands of the workers. 

Democracy is capitalism's best answer. It makes people at the bottom believe they have even a slight influence, when they really don't. It also means that progress is incredibly slow, to the point where the rich and powerful can easily get a Conservative party back into power to reverse the changes against the wealthy. 

I also think that it's inevitable that the world will transition from democracy to authoritarianism, simply because of how powerful the internet is at a tool for controlling people.",Great Britain,/r/europe/comments/cohlgy/moscow_protests_right_now/ewiwgvy/,observingatdistance,1565457824

&gt;In view of differences between both these sources and national GDP forecasts, and also the definition of NATO defence expenditure and national definitions, the figures shown in this report may diverge considerably from those which are quoted by media, published by national authorities or given in national budgets. Equipment expenditure includes expenditure on major equipment as well as on research and development devoted to major equipment. Personnel expenditure includes pensions paid to retirees.


They don't include capital city fire brigades.

defence expenditure is payments on Armed
Forces financed within the Ministry of Defence
(MoD) budget. Armed Forces include Land,
Maritime and Air forces as well as Joint
formations such as Administration and
Command, Special Operations Forces, Medical
Service, Logistic Command etc. They might also
include ""Other Forces"" like Ministry of Interior
troops, national police forces, gendarmerie,
carabinieri, coast guards etc. In such cases,
expenditure should be included only in
proportion to the forces that are trained in
military tactics, are equipped as a military force,
can operate under direct military authority in
deployed operations, and can, realistically, be
deployed outside national territory in support of
a military force.

Even if a no-deal were to take 50% off the trade with the UK, it would only be about 4% of total trade (similar to the losses that occurred due to the Russian sanctions for a number of EU members) for the EU, while the UK would lose a whooping 22.5% in addition to numerous companies relocating to the single market.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/cohlqk/what_of_eu_trade_is_accounted_for_by_the_uk/ewi9t9f/,New-Atlantis,1565443482

2029,"Extract from the link:

'Juan Sebastián de Elcano was the navigator whose expedition completed the first circumnavigation of the globe. He had been born in the Basque town of Guetaria in 1476 and died of scurvy in the Pacific Ocean in 1526. Having participated in Cardinal Cisneros’ campaign that resulted in the conquest of Oran, he took up residence in Seville, where in 1519 he joined the expedition being organised by the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan. Equipped with five ships, its aim was to sail west and find a route around southern America to reach the Spice Islands. The fleet discovered what is now the Strait of Magellan and, enduring much hardship, was the first to cross the Pacific Ocean.

Magellan was killed in the Philippines in an attack on a native settlement and Elcano took over command of the last remaining ship, the Victoria. Reaching the Moluccas in late 1521, he sailed across the Indian Ocean and finally reached the Atlantic.

After almost three years and having covered a distance of 14,000 leagues, the ship reached Sanlúcar de Barrameda on September 6th 1522 and Seville two days later. Although the Victoria arrived laden with spices, the expedition’s original crew of 285 had been reduced to 18 famished and weakened seamen.

The Spanish navigator thus completed the first historically documented circumnavigation of the globe, effectively the first ‘globalisation’.

The Emperor Charles V received the survivors at Valladolid, rewarding Elcano with an annuity of 500 gold ducats and granting him a crest depicting a globe with the motto Primus circumdedisti me (‘You were the first to circumnavigate me’).

In the present day the Spanish Navy’s training vessel is named after him, thus honouring his leading role in epic voyage.'",Europe,/r/europe/comments/cogttt/on_this_day_in_1519_a_spanish_expedition_set_off/ewi2z93/,provenzal,1565436073

That is why just throwing money around will not fix things. Now we use that money to pay for people to do certain jobs that are unrelated to this medical research. And since you can't magically make more people doctors and researchers, just taking money away there (and thus needing to move people to different jobs) is not going to do much.

Budući da začetnici pobune u Hrvatskoj, Martić i dr., umjesto da se odazovu pozivu za mirnu reintegraciju, nastavljaju rat protiv hrvatske države, i zajedno sa kolovođama pobune u Bosni, Karadžićem i dr. kuju nove osvajačke planove za zajedničko osvajanje zaštićene zone Bihać, što Hrvatska ne može dopustiti;

Budući da hrvatski i bosanski Srbi ne samo da sprečavaju povratak prognanika već i nastavljaju s progonom nesrpskog stanovništva;

Budući da srpski ekstremisti, od samih početaka pobune pa i sada, prizivlju u pomoć ostatke talijanskog fašizma, nudeći podjelu hrvatskog teritorija između talijanskog i srpskog imperijalizma;

Budući da razularene paravojne srpske postrojbe, i dalje vrše terorističke napadaje na civilno pučanstvo od Slavonije do Dalmacije, granatiraju hrvatska područja i gradove Otočac, Gospić, Karlovac, pa i za vrijeme dok u Ženevi s hrvatskom delegacijom vode političke razgovore o mirnoj reintegraciji, ponovno bombardiraju i područje Dubrovnika gdje su pale nove ljudske žrtve;

I budući da su svi pokušaji, hrvatske države i međunarodne zajednice, da pobunom otuđeni dijelovi hrvatskoj teritorija budu na miran način vraćeni pod hrvatski suverenitet bili odbačeni i izigrani, hrvatska je država prinuđena da poduzme vojno-redarstvene korake za ponovno uključivanje navedenih okupiranih područja u svoj ustavno-pravni poredak.

Prisiljeni smo na takvu odluku da bismo, nakon četiri godine uzaludnog pregovaranja stali na kraj daljem izigravanju hrvatske i međunarodne javnosti i da bismo osigurali početak vraćanja prognanika na njihova ognjišta.

Stoga u ime demokratske vlasti Hrvatske:

Pozivam pripadnike srpskih paravojnih postrojbi, koji su svojevoljno ili prisilno mobilizirani u paravojne srpske postrojbe, da predaju oružje hrvatskih vlastima, uz jamstvo da će im biti udijeljena amnestija prema važećim hrvatskih zakonima.

Pozivam inicijatore pobune da shvate uzaludnost svoga pothvata i njegovu štetnost za srpsku zajednicu u Hrvatskoj, ako ustraju u pobuni, da se predaju hrvatskih vlastima i prihvate oprost ili pravično suđenje za svoje prijestupe.

Pozivam hrvatske građane srpske nacionalnosti, koji nisu aktivno sudjelovali u pobuni, da ostanu kod svojih kuća, i bez bojazni za svoj život i svoju imovinu, dočekaju hrvatsku vlast, uz jamstvo da će im se dati sva građanska prava, i omogućiti izbori za lokalnu samoupravu prema hrvatskom Ustavu u Ustavnom zakonu uz prisutnost međunarodnih promatrača.

Pozivam predstavnike Srbije i Crne Gore (i njihove SR Jugoslavije) da prestanu podupirati ekstremiste s okupiranih hrvatskih područja, što se očitovalo i na jučerašnjim ženevskim pregovorima na kojima je sudjelovao i jugoslavenski otpravnik poslova kad su hrvatski Srbi odbili prihvatiti mirnu reintegraciju okupiranih područja. To bi bio prvi korak prema općem rješenju hrvatsko-srpskih odnosa na čitavom interesnom prostoru dva susjedna naroda, odnosno normalizacije odnosa na osnovama međusobnog priznanja.

Odlučni smo da prekinemo patnje i neizvjesnost hrvatskih prognanika s okupiranih područja, a da hrvatskim Srbima zajamčimo ljudska i etnička prava u ustavno-pravnom poretku demokratske Hrvatske.

territorial sub-units such as South Ossetia or Abkhazia are granted independence in case of dismemberment of a larger entity such as the former Soviet Union. Hence, South Ossetia did not have a right to secede from Georgia, and the same holds true for Abkhazia for
much of the same reasons. Recognition of breakaway entities such as Abkhazia and South Ossetia by a third country is consequently contrary to international law in terms of an unlawful interference in the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the affected country, which is Georgia.","Russia, Nizhny Novgorod",/r/europe/comments/co8auz/us_european_countries_call_on_russia_to_withdraw/ewhycwt/,Dalnore,1565429044

2151,"&gt; Yes, that is true - according to Russian state sourced information.

As opposed to what? ""Western corporation sponsored information""? The information which said the Iraq had WMDs? The information which blames Syria on using chemical weapons on its people, while having no evidence? The information which somehow always supports US warmongering? Seems really credible.

&gt; That argument is flawed; the irony it coming from a Russian. I have slightly altered your comment to give you some perspective -

Your argument is flawed. The irony it is coming from a Westerner. Here I changed the comment for your kind of propaganda.

&lt;Insert any other excuse, as to why the US invaded other countries and Western governments didn't do much against it&gt; Example, there is a possibility that the Syrian government used chemical weapons on their people, but there is no evidence, but since they are an ally of Russia, they are probably ""evil"", so let's invite ourselves into foreign territory because we decided we can.

&gt; Entities other than the referred ethnic group, without the UN, observed plebiscites, calling for annexation is incredibly dubious. It is a shame to see your comment upvoted in a EU space.

2194,"&gt;Combine both, the lack of density of settlement and sheer total amount of troops, making the conclusion that it'll be only a short term loss for the region is highly questionable.

Again, a few 10k troops reduction is not important. Russia reduced their troops in Germany within three years by 500k to zero after 1990.

After the cold war 1M troops were leaving Germany (US, France, Britain, Russia, ...). The remaining 35k US presence is tiny.

&gt;Further calling the biggest US military presence and more important their biggest air field in europe ""unrelated"" to potential NATO defense plans is beyond shaky without a proper source.

'Potential' is the word. Practically the US troops are participating in US missions largely unrelated to NATO: middle east, north africa, afghanistan... Many of them had negative effects on Europe, like the Libya mission which created a failed state. These missions are why we've seen millions of refugees...

&gt; If Germany truly wouldn't want to ""support"" that kind of behavior beyond mere impotent ""Signal Politik"" much more focused protests would be necessary.

2237,"Reform is very possible. Consider the case of sanctions:
Why were the conservative factions in Iran so against the JCPOA? Because Irans ability to engage in global trade through the conventional channels (as a result of lifted sanctions) loosened the stranglehold that the IRGC had on Iran’s economy and created new centers of power in the private sectors and away from IRGC rogue elements. At the very least it would empower elements that could challenge the conservatives. 

Conversely, when the US pulled out of the deal and reimposed sanctions, private sector businesses lost their access to markets and went under. The IRGC with its state power and regional network of proxies has 40 years experience of evading sanctions and is the only major economic agent in Iran able to continue its operations under international isolation. IRGC/state hold over the economy increases, the unelected political bodies can hold the economy for ransom and gain more political power, democratic elements shrink.

Similarly, in a hypothetical war scenario, domestic issues of reform and freedoms takes a backseat to the more basic issues of security and stability - think Romans and Caesar. People, regardless of their domestic allegiances, will rally around the flag against the foreign invader. They will support whoever has the means to defend the homeland against said invaders - the military, the IRGC, and in an extreme scenario, radical insurgents. This actually happened right after the 1979 revolution when Saddam attacked Iran. Without that war, the Revolution may have been very shortlived, but fighting for your freedoms goes out the window when youre too busy fighting for your life and the territorial integrity of your country.

Iran is not a totalitarian state. There are elected executive and parliamentary bodies, many of whose representatives have a democratic reform agenda. That reform is slow, because of the constant struggle with the unelected government institutions. But foreign aggression only plays into the hands of the anti-West conservatives, who’ll just say “I told you so” re: trusting/negotiating with the West.",,/r/europe/comments/co8gn9/france_doesnt_need_us_approval_to_act_on_iran/ewhtrim/,TheBlackWizardz,1565421979

2261,"&gt; Let's be clear here, Georgians have as much right to the region as Apsny because they've lived there for literal millennia. Just because you cleanse everyone who disagrees with your worldview doesn't mean you're now the rightful owner of the land. 

I'm not saying who is right and who is wrong. In such situations usually every party is right in their own way. Abkhazians didn't want to loose their identity who were a minority in their own autonomous region because they had no controll, while Georgians lived there for many generations. Usually however, it is dumbed down to ""Russia's side = evil"" and ""anti-Russia side = good"".

&gt; Foremost Georgian demands are the return of all ethnically cleansed refugees to their homes and giving them full rights and citizenship under the Georgian constitution. That is what they have the right to. no matter what new spin Russian propaganda puts on it that fact won't change.

Well, the thing is that it's not under Georgia's control, thus the Georgian constitution doesn't apply. 

Abkhazia is similar to Israel in many ways, only that Israel had the ""powerful and righteous West"" on their side while they just ""defended"" themselves from (aka ethnically cleansed) ""some Muslim infidels"", while in case of Abkhazia they have the ""evil Russia"" on their side who expelled ""some people who are opposed to Russia and thus are ally's of the West plus it helps that they are Christian"".

Similar stuff happened during the Kosovo War where Serbs were expelled, but since Kosovo is on the ""right side"" it's ok (after all Serbia/Yugoslavia was an ""evil commie"") and now the West actively supports Kosovo's independence.

Similar stuff happened to Germans in what is now Czechia and Poland, where thousands of Germans were ethnically cleansed after WW2, but since they lost a war and it was a legal agreement, that's somehow different.

In the end, only the de facto control counts. Practically, Georgians have as much right to return to their homes in Abkhazia, as have Palestinians to to return to their homes in Israel. That is the one which they can enforce, which is none.

Just understand that if for some reason Russia became a Western ally, most likely Georgia would have been seen as the oppressor and Abkhazia and South Ossetia would be just two other Kosovos.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/co8auz/us_european_countries_call_on_russia_to_withdraw/ewhu3vt/,CDWEBI,1565422487

2300,"&gt; AMSTERDAM (AP) — The heat wave that smashed temperature records in Western Europe last month was made more likely and intensified by man-made climate change, according to a study published Friday.

The rapid study by a respected team of European scientists should be a warning of things to come, the report's lead author said.

""What will be the impacts on agriculture? What will the impacts on water?"" said Robert Vautard of the Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace in France. ""This will put really tension in society that we may not be so well equipped to cope with.""

The report concluded that the heatwave in late July ""was so extreme over continental Western Europe that the observed magnitudes would have been extremely unlikely without climate change.""

In countries where millions of people sweltered through the heat wave, temperatures would have been 1.5 to 3 degrees Celsius (2.7 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) lower in a world without human-induced climate change, the study said.

Global warming is also making such extreme heat more frequent, the study by experts from France, the Netherlands, Britain, Switzerland and Germany found.

The scientists said that the record temperatures recorded in France and the Netherlands could happen every 50-150 years in the world's current climate. Without ""human influence on climate,"" the temperatures would likely happen less than once in 1,000 years.

Vautard said Europe needs to get used to such heat waves, which are likely to become more frequent and intense.

""This will go up and if we don't do anything about climate change, about emissions, these heat waves which today have an amplitude of 42 degrees, they will have three degrees more in 2050 so that is going to make 45 (degrees) roughly speaking,"" he told The Associated Press.

While the heat wave broke in Western Europe after a few days late last month, the extreme temperatures have since shifted north and are causing massive ice melts in Greenland and the Arctic.

The scientists calculated the odds of this type of heat occurring now and how often it would have happened in a world without man-made global warming and compared them. They created the simulations by using eight different sets of complex computer models.

The U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 2016 studied this new scientific method of climate attribution and pronounced it valid.

Kathie Dello, a climate scientist from NC State University in North Carolina, said the study helps to pin the blame for the heat wave on climate change.

""If searching for a culprit for the intensity of these recent European heatwaves, climate change is the obvious culprit,"" Dello said in an email. ""Attribution is just dusting for fingerprints. Climate change will continue to be a menace when it comes to extreme heat, making these events more likely and more intense.""

Another expert not connected to the study, Celine Bonfils of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, said the findings are clear: ""record hot weather events are becoming more likely, and human-induced climate change is causing this increase in heat wave frequency.""

The new report agreed with their assessments, saying that every recent European heat wave that has been analyzed ""was found to be made much more likely and more intense due to human-induced climate change.""

Because the US was not as much under the threat of an invasion for most of the cold war as Europe. So it made perfect sense to place NATO troops where the threat was. 

Since the collapse of the USSR, you don't need nearly as much protection since the Russian economy (and consequently their military capability) is still not even close to the Soviet levels of 1988. But the smaller Eastern European countries are still threatened by Russia. Moving troops eastwards from Germany to those countries might be considered threatening by the Russians so they just stay in Germany.

2410,"From another Reuters story:

&gt;U.S.-based nuclear experts said on Friday they suspected an accidental blast and radiation release in northern Russia this week occurred during the testing of a nuclear-powered cruise missile vaunted by President Vladimir Putin last year.

&gt;...

&gt;“Liquid fuel missile engines exploding do not give off radiation, and we know that the Russians are working on some kind of nuclear propulsion for a cruise missile,” said Ankit Panda, an adjunct senior fellow with the Federation of American Scientists.

&gt;Russia calls the missile the 9M730 Buresvestnik. The NATO alliance has designated it the SSC-X-9 Skyfall.

&gt;...

&gt;Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Non-Proliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said he believed that a mishap occurred during the testing of the nuclear-powered cruise missile based on commercial satellite pictures and other data.

&gt;...

&gt;Lewis and his team also examined Automatic Identification System (AIS) signals from ships located off the coast on the same day as the explosion. They identified one ship as the Serebryanka, a nuclear fuel carrier that they had tracked last year off Novaya Zemlya.

&gt;“You don’t need this ship for conventional missile tests,” Lewis said. “You need it when you recover a nuclear propulsion unit from the sea floor.”

&gt;He noted that the AIS signals showed that the Serebryanka was located inside an “exclusion zone” established off the coast a month before the test, to keep unauthorized ships from entering.

&gt;“What’s important is that the Serebryanka is inside that exclusion zone. It’s there. It’s inside the ocean perimeter that they set up. It’s not there by accident,” he said. “I think they were probably there to pick up a propulsion unit off the ocean floor.”

2426,"In September, 16 Russian regions—as diverse as the northern Arctic region of Murmansk and southern Stavropol—will be holding direct local and regional elections. As the campaign mounts, there have already been accusations of vote-rigging in places like St. Petersburg and Crimea, and in Moscow, thousands of demonstrators have been protesting the exclusion of opposition candidates in city council elections. Western observers may focus on President Vladimir Putin, but these elections show that, in Russia, other forces are at play as well.

Although Putin is undoubtedly an important and influential figure, his domestic reach has its limits. Examining the appointment of regional governors—and where their expertise lies—could give observers a greater sense of Russia’s economic and political trajectories.

Power in Russia is tightly centralized, and governors are usually members of Putin’s United Russia party, ensuring that the regions remain under Moscow’s ultimate control. But contrary to the way that Putin is often depicted—as an autocrat with control over the country’s day-to-day workings—he does not have oversight of the minutiae of Russian domestic politics.But contrary to the way that Putin is often depicted—as an autocrat with control over the country’s day-to-day workings—he does not have oversight of the minutiae of Russian domestic politics. Instead, it often falls to regional governors and their administrations to distribute state budgets and implement orders from Moscow. And although the governors are ultimately answerable to Moscow, they still have a role to play.

Once, these figures were appointed based on their personal loyalty to the Kremlin. Although loyalty is still important, governors are not immune to change, and even closeness to Putin has not prevented the president from ordering the dismissal of ineffective, weak, or corrupt governors.

In fact, Putin has rotated the regional governors several times, often before elections. This trend was particularly notable in the run-up to and after his reinauguration as president in May 2018. At that time, governors who failed to guarantee Putin large numbers of votes during the elections were generally dismissed, regardless of the economic performance of their regions. But it is not always personal. Shake-ups ahead of the September 2017 regional elections ensured that governors from Putin’s United Russia party secured wins across the board. And sometimes, there is a security element to the governor’s role. Putin has appointed Moscow-born loyalists to govern restive southern regions such as Ingushetia and Dagestan, whose clan patronage networks the Kremlin views as a threat that must be broken up.

Pressure on the governors is mounting. Moscow has been tightening up its key performance indicators for governors, including proving that they have significantly improved their regions’ economies. Every few months, a Kremlin-sponsored think tank publishes its national rankings of the regional governors. The ratings are assessed by a panel of experts along several criteria, including the number of strikes in that region, a tally of local scandals, and the investment climate. Although not a hard-and-fast rule, governors at the bottom of the pile tend to be replaced. The most recent rankings 2019 of the 85 regions put the head of Ingushetia, Yunus-bek Yevkurov, in 84th place. He was dismissed a few weeks later, ostensibly over his handling of a controversial border agreement with neighboring Chechnya that prompted widespread and prolonged protests in his region.

Putin has also placed an additional and thankless burden of responsibility on his regional governors. When he was reinaugurated in May 2018, Putin announced 12 “national projects” that must be implemented by the time his term ends in 2024. These projects, including plans to increase employment, raise living standards, and improve the quality of the roads, have been criticized by a number of Russian liberals for being too vague or broad, financially unachievable in the time frame given, or too difficult to measure. Many regional administrations have also complained about the infeasibility of the projects and a lack of direction from Moscow. Putin, a president who has historically been more focused on foreign policy, has not backed away from the projects but has given the governors a relatively free hand to implement them as they see fit, highlighting some of the importance with which he accords regional administrations.

While Putin may give orders to his officials to improve trade with Japan, China, and South Korea, it is often his representatives, heads of ministries, and governors who are responsible for taking trade delegations from these countries around Russia. Although the budgets for their regions are controlled by Moscow, governors also oversee the day-to-day implementation of laws, such as free trade zones designed to attract foreign investment. Examining some of these governors in more detail shows where Russia’s foreign and domestic policy strategy may be headed.

The Kremlin appears to be appointing governors to high-ranking regional positions who have experience in the business world or other useful backgrounds. This trend aligns with Russia’s strategy toward its own Far Eastern region.

The Kremlin over the past few years has been turning its attention to Russia’s long-neglected Far Eastern region, which it views as having huge investment potential. Changes to regional administrations reflect some of the Kremlin’s strategy for this development. The current minister of the Far East, Alexander Kozlov, was appointed in 2018. Kozlov is young for a Russian politician—just 38—and has a very strong background in coal production and processing from his time working at the Russky Ugol (Russian Coal) company. This appointment suggests something important about Russia’s plans for its extractive industry. Coal production is increasing, despite many other countries’ moves toward sustainable and fossil fuel-free energy. Official government statements support this view—Alexander Novak, the minister of energy, announced at the start of 2019 that by 2025, the Russian government will be investing $22.4 billion in coal mining and in upgrading port infrastructure. The Russian economy is natural resource-dependent, and the country is thought to have 202 billion tons of recoverable coal.

Appointing a minister for the Far East with this kind of technical experience seems to suggest that the Kremlin is working to build regional administrations that can actually deliver on Moscow’s strategy for the future, rather than simply appointing Kremlin loyalists. Given that regional governors have responsibility for the economic development of their regions, including attracting businesses and investment, appointing ministers with knowledge and connections in these industries makes sense.

Another good example can also be found in the Far East, in the Magadan region. Sergei Nosov was also part of the flurry of appointees in May 2018, when he was given the post of governor. Nosov is not local—he is originally from the Urals mining city of Magnitogorsk—but he has a very strong background in metallurgy from his time spent working in industrial regions such as Nizhny Tagil, as the head of a metallurgical plant there. The Magadan region is rich in natural resources, particularly gold, silver, and other precious metals. Nosov’s understanding of metallurgy would be particularly important in developing this sparsely populated mining region. Official sources seem aligned. According to the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment, gold and silver mining in the Magadan region reached record proportions in 2018, with 40 tons of gold and predictions of 44 tons by the end of 2019.",Australia,/r/europe/comments/cod2iz/theres_more_to_russia_than_putin/ewhi7xd/,Sayting,1565408886
2427,"Although governors do not have ultimate decision-making powers, they play a supportive role in Russia’s foreign policy and relationships with other countries.Although governors do not have ultimate decision-making powers, they play a supportive role in Russia’s foreign policy and relationships with other countries. Vasily Orlov in May 2018 became the governor of the Far Eastern Amur region, but his expertise is rather different. While Orlov does have experience in petrochemical companies, having worked at Sibur, a petrochemicals conglomerate, he originally trained as an interpreter of Chinese and English. This is particularly important given Russia’s attempts to attract investment from China and given China’s proximity to the Amur region. Orlov’s knowledge of the country could be very useful for attracting Chinese investment and gaining the trust of foreign investors. It is notable that one of the first things that Orlov has done as part of his governorship has been to revive long-standing but incomplete plans to construct a bridge between the Russian city of Blagoveshchensk and the Chinese city of Heihe, which is scheduled for completion in 2020. Most recently, in late, June Orlov delivered a speech in Chinese at a festival in his region, which was designed to promote Russo-Chinese culture.
To be sure, this is not really a discussion about where power lies in Russia, for it remains firmly in the Kremlin—these governorships are not a precursor to national leadership as they might be in other federalized countries such as the United States. The governors’ role is to remain uncontroversial and implement Moscow’s policies, rather than nurturing political aspirations of their own. Instead, some of these regional leadership changes could be reflective of the Kremlin’s strategy toward Russia’s investment climate, which in turn shapes its future foreign policy.

Looking to Russia’s Far East, it appears that the Kremlin—out of economic necessity rather than political power dynamics—is altering its approach to regional governorships. Instead of appointing former intelligence officials or military officers to the administration, the need to develop the Far East and fuel the Russian economy’s dependence on natural resources might be driving a demand for technocrats, with the industrial knowledge of how development works.

In turn, Russia’s strategy sheds light on what it might be prioritizing in its economic and political future, where personnel and financial resources might be allocated, and how the country might approach its neighbors. These rotations also highlight the fact that Russia is more than Putin, and that there are political changes at play beyond the Kremlin.",Australia,/r/europe/comments/cod2iz/theres_more_to_russia_than_putin/ewhi84z/,Sayting,1565408891

2468,"&gt; The region has seen already massive troop reductions. Many other regions in West Germany had only short term impacts. Cities got valuable space back

First up your own source shows that troop contingent in the particular region I'm talking about has remained almost constant. And signifies the largest amalgamation of US forces present in Germany both now and historically. 

In more densely settled areas like the Mannheim area the valuable space might matter, in a region that saw zero population growth since WW2, it doesn't. No other region of this size comes close to a 2:1 ratio between German locals and US Military attached population.

Combine both, the lack of density of settlement and sheer total amount of troops, making the conclusion that it'll be only a short term loss for the region is highly questionable. 

&gt;But if you ask: the US presence is largely unrelated to NATO defense and is a logistics hub for US operations in Africa, Middle-East and Asia. Also there are large CIA and other intelligence installations. Not sure why Germany should support for example the unlawful US drone wars or the wars which destabilized the middle east and north africa.


Let me remind you that Germany participated in one of those wars. I'll also like to highlight the largely successful US/Nato intervention in Yugoslavia. 

Further calling the biggest US military presence and more important their biggest air field in europe ""unrelated"" to potential NATO defense plans is beyond shaky without a proper source.

Finally, the shifting of these troops to another country (most likely our neighbor) won't end the US Drone war or CIA activity in europe. It'd merely be a shift in location to our neighbors. If Germany truly wouldn't want to ""support"" that kind of behavior beyond mere impotent ""Signal Politik"" much more focused protests would be necessary.",,/r/europe/comments/cnzsqs/us_threatens_to_withdraw_troops_from_germany_the/ewhk968/,scathefire37,1565410801

However, you have to also realize, that the reason as to why much of Europe is so lax on the military is because of the US. Since most EU government don't see warmongering as their interest and believe that the US will help them out anyway, they do not invest in the military and propaganda which promotes it (meant in a neutral sense, not negative), because that would be waste, in fact many have propaganda which tells the opposite. If you take the US out of the equation, many countries will have an actual reason to spend their money on the military and thus promote propaganda as to why a strong military is good, which in return will influence how people think about hose issues.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/cnzsqs/us_threatens_to_withdraw_troops_from_germany_the/ewhkb0s/,CDWEBI,1565410852

I already explained it but I see you want me to repeat, so.. here we go.  
I will occasionally illustrate my statements with the Belgian society.

&amp;#x200B;

* To begin with, there is the most visible part, the one you think of when you talk about Belgium: 

\-food (frites/frieten, chocolate, frikadel/fricadelle, Flemish carbonnade, waffles, etc. -- Belgian cuisine),

\-flags and emblems, their symbolism (black yellow red, rooster and lion, etc.),

\-holidays (Christmas, Sinterklaas, Halloween, Easter, etc.),

\-fashion (quite simple Western style),

\-literature,

\-music,

\-dance, 

\-languages and dialects,

\-and many others.

&amp;#x200B;

More subtly there is also:

* Unwritten rules and communication styles:

\-facial expressions,

\-gestures (the difference between an Italian and a Belgian is clearly visible),

\-personal space (there is a gap between northern and southern Europe, we like to have our own space here),

\-physical contacts (do we kiss to say hello ?, how many times ? with whom ? in what context ?),

\-the tones (ah, that was a question ?),

\-the different conversational patterns according to the social situation,

\-body language,

\-etc.

&amp;#x200B;

* The notions of:

\-courtesy and manners (for example, unlike the Japanese, burps are considered rude here, but no problem to sneeze in public.),

\-beauty,

\-modesty,

\-leadership,

\-etc.

&amp;#x200B;

* The concepts of:

\-self,

\-time (we are monochronous while Africans are polychronic),

\-roles in relation to age, gender, class, family, etc,

\-equality and justice,

\-etc.

&amp;#x200B;

* Attitudes towards:

\-the elderly (respected but they can live on their own without any problems),

\-children, teenagers (they stay longer and longer with their parents)

\-independence,

\-the relationship with animals (not fan of sacrifice but love good meat :/),

\-work (do we look more like the French, the Germans ot the Dutch? I don't know),

\-authority (Belgians like to hierarchise for example),

\-death (rather similar to the general attitude of Europeans; somber but inevitable. In contrast, many Asian countries see death less melancholically, and Mexicans celebrate it.),

etc.

&amp;#x200B;

* The approach in relation to:

\-religion (rather secular),

\-education (the structure of our education system is continental),

\-decision-making,

\-marriage (which has lost its importance for us, unlike Indians for example),

\-etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes a lot of arguing is needed to solve a certain question, and sometimes a lot of wars are needed to solve certain issues. Sweden wouldn't be independent if countries weren't allowed to fight and they definitely wouldn't own province/state ""Skåne"". So Thank God for wars!

Because the US doesn't spend their military budget effectively.

Part of the reason our spending is so high is because it's expensive to field a large, professional, well-equipped military that's expected to deploy overseas.  Few other countries expects their military to be able to deploy across either major ocean in defense of allies and be successful and effective at it.

If our only concern was defending our own borders and nothing else, it would certainly be a lot smaller but then it also wouldn't be nearly as capable elsewhere in the world.

2664,"Honestly I don’t understand your first point. Leaders of other countries, such as Jamaica, have demanded not just an apology, but reparations from the UK. I don’t understand how you feel Spain is unique in being blamed by its former colonies. If you mean to say Spain is being unfairly blamed by the Mexican President for problems that Mexico itself has created then fine, but I don’t see what that has to do with the Black Legend.

Secondly, I think I phrased my own point poorly about the use of the Spanish Inquisition as a metaphor. I agree with you here, I was simply trying to say that the average person uses the metaphor simply because it is standard and well known, and has no intention themselves of perpetuating the Black Legend, even if they are unwittingly doing just that.

Finally, people do not judge what Spain is like now based off a distorted history, ie the Black Legend, (or any history in fact). For example I do not base my opinion on Italy off my knowledge of the Roman Empire, and I doubt you would base your opinion on the UK today based off your knowledge of the Tudor Period. Of course it is true that nations and societies are shaped by their history however any rational person would conclude that it is much more valid to base their opinion of Spain on information from 2019, or at least from recent history, rather than from information about Spain in the 1400s.

Even when immigrants are found to use welfare more intensively than natives, the gap is mostly attributable to differences in social and demographic characteristics between immigrants and non-immigrants rather than to immigration status per se. Moreover, evidence in some countries suggests that immigrants exhibit less welfare dependency than natives, despite facing a higher risk of poverty.

2684,"Europe is facing a season of political turmoil in its North and South.

&gt;In the U.K. and Italy, charismatic right-wing leaders are pursuing high-risk bids for greater power that entail clashes with the European Union, potentially disrupting their nations’ economies and Europe’s already faltering growth.

&gt;The British economy is already taking a hit from the risk of a chaotic Brexit on Halloween, the latest date set for the U.K. to leave the EU. The U.K. economy, the world’s fifth largest, contracted at an annualized rate of 0.8% in the second quarter as business confidence plunged, according to data released on Friday.

&gt;It was Britain’s first quarterly contraction since 2012.

&gt;The weak data, and political turmoil over Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s determination to take the U.K. out of the EU on Oct. 31, pushed the British pound down to a multiyear low of $1.2057, before it recovered somewhat.

&gt;U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to pull his country out of the European Union on Oct. 31, with or without an exit deal. Photo: WPA Pool/Getty Images

&gt;Some of the U.K. economy’s weakness derives from intensifying global trade conflicts. But the U.K. has a particular problem with weak business investment, which has fallen in five of the last six quarters. Some forecasters say a Brexit with no agreement on the U.K.’s future relations with the EU could push the country into a recession.

&gt;In Italy, anti-immigration firebrand Matteo Salvini is pushing to bring down the government and trigger snap elections for October. Opinion polls make him the strong favorite to win a vote.

&gt;On Friday, Mr. Salvini submitted a parliamentary motion of no-confidence in the government in which he serves as deputy prime minister and interior minister. His promises include sharp tax cuts that could challenge the EU’s rules on fiscal discipline and spook bond investors who are worried about Italy’s already-high debts.

&gt;“There is momentum behind the idea that the EU is not delivering, for different reasons, in both the U.K. and Italy,” said Mujtaba Rahman, Europe head at political-risk consulting firm Eurasia Group. “Johnson and Salvini are both following a similar strategy of trying to consolidate their domestic majority, in order to increase their leverage versus the EU.”
As the U.K. negotiates its departure from the EU, one voice has been more vocal than many - Steve Bray has spent the last two years screaming “Stop Brexit” through a megaphone at the U.K.’s Houses of Parliament. Photo illustration: George Downs/The Wall Street Journal

&gt;The two countries’ looming upheavals are symptoms of backlashes against a post-Cold War political order. Many voters, in Europe and beyond, are rebelling against globalization, international agreements and technocracy, which have increasingly constrained national politics and policy in the last quarter-century.

&gt;Politicians from insurgent movements such as Mr. Salvini’s League and even some from venerable establishment parties such as the U.K. Conservatives are tapping those discontents. Now, in two of Europe’s major countries, they are risking significant economic disruption in pursuit of political change.

&gt;“The Brexit slogan, let’s take back control, hit the bull's-eye” of popular discontent with globalization and European integration, said Giovanni Orsina, director of the school of government at Rome’s LUISS university. “The great difference between the two countries is that Italy is, in some ways, in a worse position than the U.K., because of our high public debt and the euro,” he said.

&gt;“Pulling out of the EU is complicated for the U.K., but you can do it,” Mr. Orsina said. “But in Italy we went very far in integrating our economy with Europe’s, and the price of withdrawing would be too high.”

&gt;Political discontents have remained more contained in most other EU countries, so far. In Germany and Spain, mainstream parties continue to lead governments, following consensus-oriented, pro-EU policies.

&gt;But the growing fragmentation of voters’ allegiances among parties from far-left to far-right is making it harder for leaders to preserve their majorities.

&gt;The EU has shown itself adept at muddling through a variety of crises in the past decade. Most European voters continue to support the organization, often placing higher trust in it than in their national politicians, surveys show.

&gt;Events in late 2019 could test the EU’s crisis skills again, as new leaders take the helm of the European Central Bank and the EU’s Brussels-based executive arm, the European Commission, on Nov. 1.

&gt;“EU decision makers will be more concerned about the risks posed by Italy than by Brexit,” because Italy is staying inside the EU, while increasingly threatening to defy the bloc’s rules, said Mr. Rahman.

&gt;Mr. Johnson’s determination to leave the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a deal is the latest answer of the U.K. Conservatives—Europe’s establishment party par excellence—to the challenge posed by a populist upstart, Nigel Farage, whose anti-EU campaigning has eaten deep into Conservatives’ traditional support.

&gt;Mr. Johnson hopes to sideline Mr. Farage and repair voter trust in the Conservatives with an uncompromising commitment to Brexit. But the plan sets him on a collision course with the EU, which has refused to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement that was settled with former Prime Minister Theresa May in November.

&gt;Mr. Johnson’s strategy is a big gamble. His government has a majority of just one in the House of Commons, where lawmakers have made their opposition to a no-deal exit clear.

&gt;The new U.K. leader’s plan could lead to snap elections at some point this fall, either by Mr. Johnson’s choice or because lawmakers force elections upon him to stop Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal.

&gt;With voter sentiment volatile, such an election could bring to power left-wing leader Jeremy Corbyn, a prospect that also makes many investors nervous.

&gt;In Italy, Mr. Salvini’s ascension to power would put him among the ranks of world leaders, including President Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who have risen from the political fringes on a right-wing nationalist platform, benefiting from popular discontent with center-right and center-left incumbents and their perceived distance from average people’s concerns.

&gt;The Italian made his name fighting the inflow of African and Middle-Eastern refugees and other migrants.

&gt;His next promise to Italians is to challenge EU rules on budget discipline by slashing taxes and delivering a fiscal shock that his League party says will revive Italy’s long-stagnant economy.

&gt;Most economists say Mr. Salvini’s promised demand stimulus isn’t a sustainable medicine for Italy’s economy, which suffers mainly from supply-side problems, from ponderous bureaucracy to a surfeit of tiny companies.

&gt;Italian voters, however, have tired of painful structural overhauls and tight fiscal policies, and look set to give Mr. Salvini’s alternative remedy its day.

&gt;Financial markets are already growing nervous about the implications for Italy’s heavy national debt.

&gt;The Rome government flirted briefly with running a bigger deficit in 2018, but it backed down after investors dumped Italian government bonds, hurting Italy’s banks and tipping the already fragile economy into a short recession.

&gt;Mr. Salvini’s rhetoric suggests he wants to override financial markets’ fears—and go all-out for tax cuts.",,/r/europe/comments/coacuj/political_gambits_threaten_more_economic_upheaval/ewgyutx/,karisz,1565393645

Why do you pick voter ID to quarrel? Is that the one you think you have a chance to win?

In other countries one doesn't have to register to vote, you're already on the list and you will receive letters to tell you where to go. In some countries voting is even mandatory by law.

Voter ID is a Rep. lever on those who can't obtain a driver's licence or a passport, people who most likely will vote for Dems.

30k outside Madrid / Barcelona buys you roughly the same quality of life as 60k in the Netherlands or 80k in Switzerland... and a lot more than 100k+ in the Valley (no reasonable amount of money will buy you quality of life in that hellhole).

&gt;most of those jobs are in Madrid or Barcelona where 30k won't get you far unless you live with your parents.

There are thousands of readily open positions in the smaller hubs like Málaga, Valencia, Bilbao, Sevilla or Coruña.

Actually some left wing writers and activists do strongly propose the idea that the UK and/or US should apologise and pay reparations. I’ve never seen anyone demand this of Spain (or Belgium), but I find it highly plausible that certain individuals would indeed demand that though. Nonetheless the point here is that Spain is not unique in this regard. Secondly, the use of Spanish Inquisition as a metaphor is simply because the Spanish Inquisition is the most well known witch trials, and the saying is now commonplace. Of the course the fact that it is well known is in part due to the Black Legend, however this has no bearing on its modern usage.   Also the term definitely does not carry the same severity as ‘Nazi’. Anyway, my point essentially is that any continuation of the Black Legend of Spain’s history does not influence people’s opinion on modern Spain.

This means that the average duration of an Italian government is a little over a year. Less than half of all governments ever lasted over a years, in fact.

And if we take just the Republic, it's actually somewhat worse, with the duration of governments being a little lower than the total average or a little higher if Mussolini is excluded.

The last decade was somewhat stable by comparison, with six governments (or rather five and a half, as Berlusconi's last government lasted from 2008 to 2011), by comparison, however, the previous decade had 5 governments (or rather 4 as one started in 1998 and ended in 2000), three of which were Berlusconis, for a total of nearly eight and a half years.",Magna Graecia,/r/europe/comments/cnytg1/europes_top_5_economies_2019_original_image_with/ewfzkxv/,Alpha413,1565370660

2943,"&gt; First you need to understand the real politics of international relations, not the propaganda bullshit that you are fed through mainstream media.

Sometimes I wish I was Jared, 19.

I'm sure it took you a lot of time and brain power to write all this, it'd be really sad if noone engaged with you. I'm also sure there's something of value in here, so let's do this.

&amp;nbsp;

... Alrighty then.

First economy is hard power not soft, I'd hoped someone who understands the *real* politics of international relations would know this. Or maybe it's part of that propaganda bullshit of the mainstream media. 

1 strike.

You're right, Poland is too close to Russia. That's why the US is wary to settle down there. But not because any hypothetical base is directly threatened but because it's directly threatening. Russia won't take kindly to a US military base at it's border and Trump is absolutely not going to risk his relation with Putin over that. His goal is deescalation, which moving to Poland is the opposite of. 

2 strikes. 

The Polish government consists of American agents? Damn, that is something there. Unbelievable. As in literally unbelievable. There's noting treasonous about the Polish government wanting a US base, it's directly in line with their interests and would have wide public approval. 

Especially as there is no real EU-wide confidence in joint military ventures, the West is being suspiciously shady about this and the East very jumpy. Having a US base there is what's best for everyone involved but the US and Russia. At least at this point in time. See, no need for American agents, good ol' alliances and interests convergence is more than enough to get the job done. Less costs and risk-free.

3 strikes. You're out. 

Too bad you'd almost made it to the half point. Valiant effort though, I'm impressed. I'm sure you'll make it there eventually. You just have to keep trying.

Just for fun, here are a little extra misses:

+ Building a base in a no-deal brexited UK is absolutely not putting pressure on Europe. And I don't even want to know how you came up with it making the EU less self-sufficient, if anything that's the exact opposite of what would happen. With the US and the UK gone, France's project for a EU army would become much more attractive.
+ Is it ""allies helping them?"" or ""allies eloping with them?"". Taking the piss, I know , but I find it funny that both could apply and make sense there.
+ The only tension that would come from Scottish independence would be about the Trident, which is a UK-only issue. The US wouldn't care either way, the nuclear capability of their ally is the last thing that would be relevant to them. They have enough of that already on their own.
+ If Brexit becomes a shitshow, US intervention would only make it worse, just like it does everytime they try to ""stabilise"" a country. That's why the strategy is to offer them a deal overwhelmly in the US' favour, it stabilises the country before anything bad happens and makes them an economic dominion without any need for troubles. If Brexit is a shitshow, the US will wash their hands off them so fast there'll still be remnants of soap on them afterwards. 
+I'm sure you thought your insight on what politics are was groundbreaking but I am sorry to inform you this is one of the most common belief about it. 
+ I am also very sorry to be the bearer of such bad news, but of the 4 helicopters in service in the German military, only 1 was built by Americans. The other 3 were developped by Airbus Helicopters, which is part German. The American one is the Bell UH-1 Iroquois which was made in the 1956 and is a relic of the past (the polite way to call a rusty piece of junk) barely in use. Germany has no interest nor will to buy them from the US.
+ You did mean helicopters when you wrote helos, right? Not that it matter much, there have been a push recently from Germany to buy less American and more European where military is concerned. I don't think a temper tantrum is going to change much. 

Don't be too disappointed with yourself though, it takes a lot of courage to go and shout your opinion like that, you should be proud! And I was right, there were some sentences worth something sprinkled in there! I knew, you had it in you!

+ You were right when you said that the US doesn't want a strong EU. 
+ That pulling out of Germany would be counterproductive to that policy.
+ That Poland is too close to Russia as I mentioned.
+ That Germany is very well placed on a strategic point of view.
+ And of course, that all of this is stupid posturing from Trump and as usual a shameless pandering to his domestic audience.
+ And that nothing will change. 

Now, is all of this as interesting and revolutionary as you advertised it to be? 

Well I guess it is a matter of tastes and appreciation and which metrics you'd use to evaluate it all. I wouldn't even know how to begin to answer. But,

 *Nah it wasn't.*

America is entrepreneur-friendly, EU is worker friendly.

But if your goal is to have a stable, secure job with benefits, America is NOT the place for that unless you land a gov job, and you can’t misrepresent facts: labor laws are outdated or minimal here except for construction in some states.

SALARY: You’ll get paid a fixed $45k-$50k a year and they’ll NEVER let you work less than 40 hrs a week, always more (45-50).

HOURLY PAY: The min wage can’t even pay rent and food in a shitty neighborhood, so you’ll have to put in crazy overtime (40+) to mot live in panic.

BENEFITS: Legally nonexistent, overpriced healthcare even if you’re covered, high premiums that nobody can pay personally. Paid vacation days and sick time is standard 10 days a year total (10 days out of 365 is enough for leisure, destressing, and personal needs?? after working 40+ hours year-long??

2996,"did I say anything about them giving stuff ? I just pointed out that PO was and still is using exactly same type of political bullshit talk, outright lying into faces of people.
Both PO and PiS are guilty of this.

&gt;And those flights maybe are wrong but nothing special (in my opinion). I wonder why people make such noise about it if there are affairs bigger by few order of magnitudes. What about SKOK, GetBack and ""developer"" affairs? Poland should investigate that as well as Amber Gold and VAT affairs. Even prosecutor's office is restraining from doing something. Not to mention about committees which PiS simply don't want to create.

Thats true, those should be investigated too.

&gt;nd about how PiS ""love"" EU. Here is video on youtube where PiS MP Krystyna Pawłowicz is saying about her ""liking"" for EU: youtube.com/watch?v=cvFc1ybRjW0 - it starts about 1:40. I'ts in Polish, but i suppose you know the language. For those who don't understand polish. She says (about EU flag): Mister, European Union is a rag for me. A rag. Really is a rag. First of all because it's not a flag of any country... (and she continues).

If you wan't to delve into the past (like they did with Tusk). In 2004 they joined eurosceptics in UE parliament thogether with Le Pen and Italian neofascist. In 2015 PM Beata Szydło removed EU flags from conference room of KPRM (Chancellery of the Prime Minister). Source in polish.

I did NOT say they ""love"" EU,  what she said was douche thing to say but it doesnt contradict PiS views, you make same mistake many people  who are are for more EU make, euroscepticism does NOT mean someone wants to leave EU for sure, definition of of euroscepticism:
""means criticism of the European Union (EU) and European integration. It ranges from those who oppose some EU institutions and policies and seek reform (soft Euroscepticism), to those who oppose EU membership outright and see the EU as unreformable (hard Euroscepticism or anti-European Unionism/anti-EUism).""

PiS is soft eurosceptics, they want to stay in EU but wants EU to have influence on individual countries, they want EU to be more of trading block with common rules on goods.

&gt;PO-PSL wasn't perfect but who rules now? Who promised to be better than they where?

While this is true we should remember that interest rates are at freaking ZERO %. Thats totally unheard of in history and even more astonishing for the southern European nations which used to have double digit ones.

For the Hundred Days Offensive casualties on wikipedia it counts it beginning from 18th July - Before the operation actually began, which incorrectly includes the Second Battle of the Marne. During the *actual offensive* however, [British casualties](https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/hundred_days_offensive) were about 300,000 and French 279,000. 

For the Spring Offensive, the main offensive was directed at the BEF during [Operation Michael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Michael) and halted at the [Battle of the Lys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Lys_(1918)). For the Somme obviously there were substantially more British, the wikipedia page does show 453,000 British casualties against 200,000 French. As for the 1916-18 period, cumulative [French casualties](https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/war_losses_france) were 651,000, but [BEF casualties](https://www.cwgc.org/find/find-war-dead/results?servedWith=Australian%252cCanadian%252cNew%2BZealand%252cSouth%2BAfrican%252cUnited%2BKingdom&amp;dateFrom=01-01-1916&amp;dateTo=01-01-1920) including died of wounds were almost 797,000.

3508,"This is indeed all personal opinion to some point, but I have strong personal and professional ties to the academia of Bogazici, Bilgi and Sabanci universities. The change for both the students and academics is very visible in all of them. Not just them, but these people had a great deal of influence on the Turkish left including kemalist left. Birikim, Taraf etc. were respected and listened to. Now they are paratoners of hate, nobody that has ever had something to do with either of them has any respect.

What we understand from the word liberal is obvious in Turkey. The second-republican movement was never ideologically super consistent, but you can say that they are economically orthodox, socially constructivist and politically anti-kemalist for a short explanation. What is unterstood by the word liberal is different in all contexts and countries because it became an ideological vacuum cleaner incorporating any and everything the current order stands on. In any given context it can mean a rules based global order, neoliberal economics, normative approach to human rights or non-economic social progressivism which may sound similar in itself, but the pick-and-choose model this wideness allows very non coherent liberal movements around the world. Turkey's liberal movement didn't emphasize the rule of law that much in neither Ergenekon nor Habur for example in favor of other tenets, which arguably led to their own demise. The people who got the legitimacy to call themselves *the* liberals in Turkey indeed lost all political legitimacy after the YAE fiasco.


Islamist intelligentsia and liberals grouped together isn't a brand new idea. Where are you going to put Cemil Kocak for example, fits to some degree in both.

3564,"Venice is a lagoon, a sort of sea within a sea, in reality close to a marsh. It isn’t that deep and enormous boats disturb the ground more. In addition, the place where they dock is right in the centre, which at its height accommodated 150 000 people living there but today gets a million visitors. Space constraints and the fact it’s literally sinking makes it a difficult place for large boats.

In comparison, Dubrovnik has better infrastructure for large boats as the port as far away from the historic old town. The port is a very large area and could probably accommodate 3 or 4 big boats at once with no problem. Add to this the fact that the Adriatic Sea is deeper there than the Venetian Lagoon and it’s a fine place for boats to drop anchor.

There are other problems around cruise ships and the sheer quantities they move, but Venice is less equipped for the present than Dubrovnik for the above reasons.",Scotland,/r/europe/comments/cnoj1z/venice_bans_large_cruise_ships_from_historic/ewemrr5/,TheEvilScotsman,1565329238

I'm not *talking* about a static website, I'm talking about user logins.

The slaughter Germans inflicted was so scientifically detached, so cold and calculated, killing everyone of a particular ethnicity: old, young, female, etc. All major European powers dabbled in genocide, but all of them had factors that made them less momentous of genocides in some way or another.

The shoah was to genocide what WW1 was to war: the arrival of the industrialization.


Best described in Patent application T 58240 Kl. 24 ""Continuous Operation Corpse Incineration Furnace for Intensive Use,"" which is a pretty horrifying document describing process optimization in a Nazi death factory. It  shows the difference between the Holocaust and other genocides.

To cite the german wikipedia:

&gt;In October 1941, cooperation began with Karl Bischoff, the construction manager of the SS in Auschwitz, for the construction of Crematorium II with five three-muffle furnaces in the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp (see also Gas Chambers and Crematoria of the Auschwitz Concentration Camps). The capacity of the Auschwitz-Birkenau facilities for a total of 4,416 corpses per day was extraordinary[2]. 

&gt;These systems were installed and also repaired on site by engineers of the company. Ventilation systems were also installed in the Auschwitz gas chambers to enable faster degassing and thus a faster sequence of killings. Employees of the Topf &amp; Sons company had an insight into the crimes through their work in the extermination camp. Heinrich Messing and Karl Schultze, in particular, were there when the first mass murder took place in Crematorium II on March 14, 1943. Records describing work on the ""dressing cellar""[3] or the procurement of gas-tight windows and doors as well as indicators for hydrogen cyanide residues also testify to complicity.

&gt;**Engineers such as Kurt Prüfer[7] also developed ""suggestions for improvement"" such as the so-called express work: Three corpses were to be burned in each furnace. The designers therefore knew that nobody would receive finely separated ashes for burial purposes. One of the ""improvements"" at Auschwitz was a modification of the furnaces, in which the body fat escaping from the corpses was fed directly into the flames and used for firing.**

&gt;In a received document, an internal and ""secret"" stamped letter of September 8, 1942,[8] from examiners to the management of his company, the capacities of the three furnaces in operation are given as ""250 per day"", those of the five furnaces under construction are given as ""800"", and in addition two furnaces are promised, which could cremate another 800 corpses daily. The company had such eight-muffle furnaces in stock for a planned large warehouse in Mogilew; ""furnaces"" had been branched off from deliveries there. The SS demanded more furnaces from Topf so that the urgent calls would finally be silenced.

&gt;**On February 19, 1943, Prüfer suggested to the central construction management in Auschwitz that the exhaust air from the ovens be used to heat ""Leichenkeller 1,"" i.e., the gas chamber, in crematorium II. Apparently, this was intended to ensure the release of the hydrogen cyanide gas from Cyclone B, even at low ambient temperatures.[9]**

&gt;**On 4 November 1942, the company filed an application for a patent for a continuous furnace for the mass burning of corpses with the Reich Patent Office Berlin under number T 58240 Kl. 24.[10] The patent application shows that the pot engineer Fritz Sander,[11] who formulated the application, was aware of the intended purpose, namely the burning of the corpses of camp inmates. The draft description states:

&gt;In the collection camps of the occupied eastern territories, which were caused by the war and its consequences, with their inevitably high mortality rate, the burial of the large number of deceased camp inmates is not feasible. [...] There is therefore a compulsion to quickly, safely and hygienically remove the large number of corpses by cremation. Of course, this cannot be done in accordance with the legal provisions applicable to the territory of the Reich""[12].

&gt;According to Sander, the patent specification was classified as secret and therefore not processed by the Reich Patent Office.[11] However, historian Annegret Schüle also considers it possible that the patent was not granted because the invention contradicted applicable law,[13] according to which the ashes of different corpses could not be mixed.

&gt;**The functional principle of the furnace should correspond to that of a combustion conveyor: On the one hand, the time for loading and emptying the combustion chamber was to be eliminated, on the other hand, additional fuel consumption was to be eliminated, since the corpses served as fuel for each other. A description of Sanders for ""Cremation furnaces for concentration camps"", intended for the management, describes the inclined arrangement inside the plant and the use of gravity in the context of mass combustion:**

&gt;**The corpses glide into the heated furnace by their own force of gravity on appropriately inclined and shaped supports and then further down, getting burned in this way to finally burn out and incinerate at a suitable point inside the furnace. ""**[14]

Christ, I dont believe for a second that you dont have rudimentary knowledge of how justice system works, thus this is pointless waste of time, but here goes anyway

In order for judge to make a rulling for that, prosecutory would have to present a case and Rackete legal team would have to present her defense. Based on that, testimony of experts, hearing of witnesses etc. judge would eventually make a determination of the case.

There wasnt none as prosecutor didnt charge her yet with anything. He requested that she be kept under house arrest because he deemed her a flight risk and brought this to judge to make a rule on that. She said no as she didnt see her as flight risk and then went on things that none asked her about and she was in no position to make expert assesment on, per above.

4225,"&gt; If every country in Europe adopts climate directives, it makes a big impact... it adds up. Is that really that hard to understand?

Other countries can easily do it because they don't have their economy based on coal or they're rich enough to pay for transition. Poland is not. Neither are Serbia and Bosnia and your economies would get hit hard as well and I'm sure you'd be one of the countries to oppose such EU laws. I have no idea what's your problem with Poland then. It's not that the EU is going to build wind turbines for free just to replace our coal-based power plants.

They had a nice pool and a pool bar, which was empty the first two days, there were only around 30 guests in that ~300 room hotel. On the third day, 4 irish guys joined the party, they were super nice and always invited me to drinks at the pool bar. I had like six drinks with them in two days, then i left. These fuckers never left the pool while i was there. Sometimes one passed out and almost drowned, and the punishment for almost dying was to drink a liter of water and then they continued to drink. It was kinda nasty, but at the same time, i never thought bad of them, even if they were loud and drunk 24/7. It was pretty bizzar. One of them asked me for my number, in case he wanted to catch up. Mind you i only talked to them for a few minutes at the time, they didn't even knew my name. I gave them my number and forgot about it. A month later someone called me in the middle of the night and asked me how i was doing, while being super drunk.

How the various elections worked in republican rome. Even the plebs in Rome had so much more power than a pleeb outside of Rome. For Rich families even outside of Rome weren't a problem and they didn't vote in the same group as the pleebs anyways.

&gt;why did the people need this welfare? promises of handouts only work if people actually rely on those handouts.

It was the growth of the city which was highly unsustainable. The city itself demanded much more food than rural Italy could provide and needed thus to be shipped from other places.  This also increased the price which required subsidies or free bread. This process was highly corrupt.

4403,"iphone is not a basic necessity, its a luxury item with some other applications. 


Meat is food, u need food to live the same way as u do water. Do you like the idea of water being more expensive? How about if u really love water or it brightens your day when u consume water and now suddenly u can no longer afford it and at best can drink it once every 3 days or smtn? What if the price of water keeps going up and up and its quality at best remains the same (while your salary/income gets indexed to country level inflation level). But fear not, the 1% can still afford to drink all the water they want, fill up the pool, spray the lawn and do whatever the fuck they want with it, because for them when they used to pay 10cents, now they have to pay 11 or 12, while for you the measurement is in dozens of euro/dollars. This is the rich vs poor when it comes to prices on ANYTHING reality. 


I love your line of thinking though, money is everything, money is a god, money is a virtue, if u have money u can do anything u want, disregarding anything else, BUY MORE, CONSUME MORE, POLLUTE MORE, EXTERMINATE flora and fauna, hell yeah, lets go. Wait a minute...


What if (and that's a crazy possibility i know) that line of thinking is **exactly** how we got to the current world we live in? What if at some point in our past, people correctly predicted that consumerism (and capitalism and its inevitable regression/decay to an extent) is not the wave and it will lead to the destruction of our world in various ways (climate change, biosphere collapse, inadequacy of infinite growth in finite world/resources and all that) but were laughed at, shunned away and generally made shut up by fairy tales/suppression of information and plenty of other methods, including the usual kick the can down the road mentality. 


Now that's a crazy idea all right! Phew, so glad we dodged the bullet there, that world would be more or less doomed to be miserable for generations to come and the basic human rights, humanitarian values and all that would be thrown out the window the moment tens of millions of refugees start showing up at the other more ""successful"" countries borders. 


As for the purpose of carbon/meat tax and other environmental measures its not really a rocket science - let the poor shmucks bear the overwhelming majority costs for transitioning, **while maintaining current lifestyle for the wealthy**. It has a bit of a silver lining besides self preservation instincts of human race, that is we *might, might* not completely decimate the environment/nature and only wipe out 50-60-70-80-90 percent of biodiversity of our planet (depending how things go obviously), but humanity is directly responsible for current mass extinction event going on, that's a fact and we've done PLENTY. 


After all said and done, i probably should mention that i am not against carbon pricing/taxes and other environmental measures, but if ""The poor were to suffer"" i would like the ""elites/wealth"" to suffer AT LEAST proportionally just as much. 


Arguably, i would like them to bear responsibility for misleading world, for selling fairy tales, for undermining and cutting every possible corner in regards to environment protection and its discussion (and the mass pollution which followed that), for suppression of discussion of the issue and many things more to be held accounted for. 


They can start by opening their purses which are full of fucking money that they stole or ""creatively moved"" to offshore tax havens for decades prior. What was the number again, i remember reading smtn along the lines of 27 trillion$ in offshore accounts or smtn. How about they fucking pay the majority brunt of transitioning costs for a better tomorrow? No downsides right ""make our living standards sustainable economy""? That is to say, i'm not really looking forward to expropriate wealth and make them penniless, but to pay for crimes and morally deplorable actions that they committed prior, which heavily contributed to the world we live in. 


Then introduce the meat tax, the carbon tax, the whatever else u can come up with. Fuck it, introduce a temporary 10-20 year luxury ban or something along the lines of it on shit like super yachts, super jets and other ""glamorous bullshit"", so that the poor actually see with their own eyes, that they are not being bullshitted into sacrificing themselves for the sake of some rich billionaire fuck and his family/relatives, but for the ""greater good"". 


Maybe make an environmental inquisition and give them plenty of power + hire young people with kids, so that if they cut corners and take bribes and shit, its their fucking kids that will suffer as well.

Currently I am for legalizing above a certain age. Maybe 20 and above but open to change based on evidence.

Thing is there is strong evidence that Marijuana use in children/teens has strong effects on developing brains and massively increases the risk of mental illness developing.
So if we just make it legal without any measures against that it will also increase the amount of children who have access to it.

But the status quo is also bad.

So I'd say make it legal but have strong laws against giving it to children and actually firmly enforce those laws. You can also use some of the tax money to increase research into Mariuana (also it not being illegal helps with research) and campaigns to try keeping it outside the hands of children.
You will never be fully successful with it but you have to at least try.

Anyway, looking at income is a bad way to look at wealth. You have to look at wealth directly. You can inherit absurd amounts from your rich parents while having a low income otherwise.

4622,"Ok, it seems you do understand a lot about referendums, but not about Romanian referendums. I'll give a short ermmm rundown of Romanian referendums and try to get my frustration and also my reasoning across. We need to go back 20 years, when the 1st referendum passed that stated there should be only 300 politicians, it passed with a lot of votes and the participation was high. And you guessed it, "" it was only consultant, no need to apply it"", and evrey party dropped the subject. Then Traian Basescu became president, I disliked him with a passion, from contradictory statements to his early days, from his previous ... don't get me started, but, he elegebly won bouth elections by a very thin margin, were talking 100.000 votes. In Romania, regardless of the outcome, around 1.000.000 are fake. No ifs, no buts, to get elected with less than 1mil votes, you are going to be suspected of fraud, voting fraud, nothing new, going over 1 mil, ok. even if I don't like you, let's see what you can do. And why is this important, during his presidency, he showed that all parties are the same corrupt sht. Psd + anyone = love. They will do anything and everything to stay in power. And, as a farewell gift to all parties, he made DNA ( anticorruption organization) and put LCK in charge, with a simple direcive:"" legally, fight high class corruption"". Never outdo your bounds and go ham. And she did, with a passion. Then, PSD, seeing that she is actually competent, and follows the law to the letter, ... well fuck. PSD made a special law that made corruption legal, and people were on the streets with torches, pitchforks and what have you. We were pissed af. ( worth mentioning, Traian Basescu tried to change the special fast rescue intervention, SMURD for short, and he was meet with similar backlash, so he pulled out in less than 48h) . Now, what PSD can do to A stop getting high ranking officials into prison, B get the ones in prison out? Make a new commission, what else, the purpose being A and B, nothing else. Now, since this is "" legal "" you got sparks, but nothing serious. But LCK is still alive, and she did nothing illegal, unethical probably, illegal she would be in prison. So, jump her up, make some bs claims, and keep her out of office as much as possible. Or send her, to Brussels, but then Brussels corruption would have a problem, and if they have a problem, PSD corruption has a steel dildo up the ass. 

Time for a referendum, in this political shitstorm, cuz why not: should marriage be between a man and a woman? And nobody showed up, generally, referendums are for 1 day, this one lasted 2. Etc etc etc. And, of those that went, the main idea was: don't change the constitution mofos, what you do, in the comfort of your home it's your problem, just keep it out of obvious sight, don't hurt nobody. Have fun.

Then, some new shit went down, and our current president, Iohanis, called for a new referendum on justice, wich it passed. ( This is the voting for EU  people referendum, with a high turnout ). Now, one was sent to jail, a million acts of corruption need to be stopped. And, of course, nah, were PSD, referendums don't really affect us.

&gt;Boris Johnson’s ‘anti-elite’ chief of staff Dominic Cummings lives in  a luxurious £1.6 million townhouse in the heart of Islington – and his  wife’s family owns a castle.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cummings, who ran the official Vote Leave campaign, regularly rants about taking on a rich and powerful “Establishment” on his [blog](https://dominiccummings.com/).  
&gt;  
&gt;But the Red Roar can reveal that he lives in a [£1.6 million](https://1067912.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cummings-Townhouse.png)  townhouse in leafy Islington, a short walk from the posh restaurants  and cocktail bars of Upper Street. Shortly after moving in 2013,  Cummings got an extension designed by high-end architects Hamish &amp;  Lyons that [features](https://1067912.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cummings-Extension.png) a “tapestry room”, along with a “formal living room” and reading room.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Cummings is no stranger to grand designs: he is married to Mary Wakefield, deputy editor of The Spectator and [daughter](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/hunt-is-on-for-the-mole-who-exposed-email-scam-in-goves-empire-2358215.html) of Sir Edward Humphry Tyrrel Wakefield, a baronet who owns Chillingham Castle in Northumberland.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sir Humphrey’s staff [write](https://chillingham-castle.com/the-family/) that he has “two sons and a daughter who are frequent visitors, along with their many friends”, while [EU documents](http://cap-payments.defra.gov.uk/Details.aspx?CAPPaymentProcessed2ndId=7233245&amp;Page=&amp;Sort=) show that the castle grounds are home to a herd of CAP-funded cattle.

4626,"&gt;Yes they were 'printing money' to keep labor costs low and remain competitive.

Actually, throughout this time wages in Italy were at least partly indexed, i.e. raising with prices, something that further increased inflation. The main reason the Bank of Italy was printing money was to cover the ever present budget deficit of around 10% of GDP, not to retain competitive exports. Actually, when the Bank of Italy gained independence and the indexation of wages were mostly scrapped, the inflation went down from 20% in 1980 to single digits around 5% in the late eighties, the exchange rate stabilised *and* exports increased.

&gt;And this situation repeated itself with the introduction of the Euro, allowing Italy to get lots of cheap loans and continue overspending. That was the cause for Greece's debt crisis as well.

Partly true, but the debt to GDP ratio for Italy didn't really change dramatically when joining the Euro. Debt was around 100% of GDP in the early nineties, then increased to around 130% with the 1993 recession, and then slowly moved down to around 100% again, which is where it remained until the beginning of the financial crises. The Euro didn't lead to Italy's high debt, it was there from the beginning and strictly following the Maastricht criteria, Italy shouldn't even have been let in in the first place.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/cn5oxi/support_for_the_single_currency_the_euro/ewaphm5/,CanadianJesus,1565248824

In any case it appears the current crisis is over due to these actions, save for a few odd privateers (that German chick), but it was achieved by the actions of two countries, and the floodgate is being guarded by countries/peoples that are ultimately outside of your control.

What worries me is even now there is still no real consensus on what to do, Italy and Greece and Hungary did what they did, they were tutted and berated by the north until their own people rebelled.

&gt; In 1953 United States Senator Joseph McCarthy recited before his subcommittee and the press a list of supposedly pro-communist authors whose works his aide Roy Cohn found in the State Department libraries in Europe. The Eisenhower State Department bowed to McCarthy and ordered its overseas librarians to remove from their shelves ""material by any controversial persons, Communists, fellow travelers, etc."" Some libraries burned the newly forbidden books. President Dwight D. Eisenhower initially agreed that the State Department should dispose of books advocating communism: ""I see no reason for the federal government to be supporting something that advocated its own destruction. That seems to be the acme of silliness."" However, at Dartmouth College in June 1953, **Eisenhower urged Americans concerning libraries: ""Don't join the book burners. Don't be afraid to go in your library and read every book....""**",Romania,/r/europe/comments/cmyqgz/turkish_government_destroys_more_than_300000/ewaqpmr/,adevland,1565249639

4721,"People need to know that often in the former communist countries the political parties name themselves or claim a certain ideology but in reality they are just looking out for the individual and aim to just create a functional modern feudalist state.

Now i shall explain which is which:

- PSD claiming to be social democrats they are in fact former 2nd row communists that toppled Ceaușescu. They only care about personal gain we call them ”ciuma roșie = the red plague” and we greet them with ”Muie PSD = PSD s***s dick”. To sum it up they are corrupt commies.

- PNL the liberals, are the last relevant traditional political party in Romania being founded back in the kingdom days. 

They have been in power for a while and proved to be just as corrupt and incompetent as PSD.

Not commies but corrupt still.

Their high score is due to them being the party of the romanian president Klaus Johannis which is popular (last poll gave him 41% of the voting choice on the upcoming presidential elections this fall)

PNL's score is probably 80% due to Johannis as they do not have any other remarkable politician.

- USR liberals, are the new kids in town. 

Never been into power they are made out of ppl that went: i am not a politician but i bet i can do better than the current ones since all they do is in their personal interest.

They are our hope pretty much and are the cleanest since they are made out of ppl that were never part of politics.

Sure they might  turn out to be shit but is still better than PSD imho.

- UDMR the hungarian minority party, they are usually willing to join any governing coallition and provide a stronger majority in exchange for holding offices that could not normaly hold with their own election score. 

They were part of both social democrat and liberal goverments.

They have been losing voters because of their association with the current PSD goverment especially from the hungarian ethnics that live in the big cities in Romania where USR (the liberal new guys) have crushed everybody.

They are making the best of what they get and a strong governing coallition means stability so is good to have such an option when needing to form one.

They are the most likely to join an PNL+USR+PLUS future governing coallition.

- ALDE communist corrupt liberals, scum of the earth PSD's best bud, they did not even got past the 5% minimum requirement in the european elections, they are expected to implode one way or the other.

- PMP former president's Băsescu's party, corrupt oportunists probably will sizzle down in time and just lose most of their current voters.

- PRO corrupt commies that lost the internal struggle for power in the PSD and got kicked out.

Now they are trying to pull distruntled or oportunistic former colleagues from PSD to grow and become the new corrupt commie claiming to be social democrat powerhouse.

Since PSD is rolling downhill i expect them to succed in their goal.

- PLUS new kids liberals, same as USR made of new people in politics and lead by our former technocrat prime-minister Dacian Cioloș.

Former Agriculture Commissioner of the EU and current leader of the Renew Europe alliance in the EU parliament he is fairly popular and trusted in Romania.

Most of us expected him to join USR instead of making own party but even so they will probably end up together since they ran the european elections as a unit: USR Plus.

Yes there is, evidence, the topic we're discussing. This poll. Your comment history, me living in Germany from 2004 to 2005 and 2011 to 2012.

&gt;Whenever Obama came to Berlin he was greeted with open arms. 

You called him Hitler for the NSA spying. Your media failed to report that NSA spyiung was done with your intel agency...and that your intel agency spied on Hillary and most likely shared it with Russia.

&gt;hen a large minority of Americans voted for an fucking joke of a man. An overgrown orange baby.

Try to broaden your view of history, it didn't begin in 2016. While you're at it look at all your former politicians working with Russian energy firms. Germany is literally a Trojan horse in NATO.

&gt;The fact that you equate this with a fraudulent reporter shows how far you've been removed from any observable reality.

The lack of self-awareness here is amazing and shows how indoctrinated you are. All of your thoughts begin with hate of Americans and work backward form there.

&gt;Most articles published by Relotius weren't about America

Holy fucking shit, now you're trying to excuse this shit. 

&gt;Yes, his lies did criticize aspects of the American society unjustly,

No, he literally made things up to appeal to people like you who even now..in this comment..are pretending his lies were real. Holy fucking donkey balls. I'm going to save your comment for posterity to show how far gone the typical German is with his hate of us.

If Americans were black you'd be David Duke.

4873,"&gt; I feel like its a bit unfair to say that the Brits voted for Boris (who was actually only voted in by about 100 thousand people) or Theresa May (who yes tbf was voted in, albeit without a majority) out of fear.

Boris &amp; Nigel were ""voted in"" when people voted for all the absolute BS both of them were promoting during the initial Brexit referendum. Then people *re-elected* the idiot government of Theresa May, *despite* her proving for years that she had no fucking clue what she was doing and absolutely no progress on the largest catastrophe the UK has faced since WW2.

&gt;Im lucky enough to be able to vote SNP but I feel like we should feel sorry for the English not because they are dumb or anything like that but because of their lack of realistic alternatives to the twats they are electing.

Practically any alternative to leaving the EU - which is the single largest source of trade &amp; prosperity for the lone Island nation - would have been better.

&gt;Finally, in relation to your point about voting farther right, Boris is actually a rather central candidate. Although he is incompetent and wants a hard Brexit, he has a fairly mixed bag when it comes to his track records in that he was one of the politicians in the UK who has campaigned for the development of LGBT+ rights from a fairly early stage.

4904,"&gt; the west treats it differently to suit their interests

Again, I'm not denying countries pursue their interests.  I literally said that.

&gt; If you're trying to police the world at least be consistent about it.

Like all countries the US pursues its interests, that's the consistent piece. 

&gt;And no, no warcrimes were commited in Kosovo by the Serbian troops, in fact the Albanians commited them but Haradinaj and his boys won't ever be punished for it because SERBIA BAD and that sweet sweet US military base in Kosovo needs to remain there.

Of course Serbian troops committed war crimes in Kosovo, there are dozens of examples of massacres of civilians by Serbian troops.

As for the base, I don't think that was really the US reason for intervention and supporting Kosovo's independence.  At the time the Cold War had only recently ended but the US still had a lot of other military bases around Europe and were gradually withdrawing troops from them.  The US had plenty of space for troops if that's what it wanted.

I think the real reason was that the US has an interest in European stability and in keeping Russia from expanding its influence, both of these were served by intervening in Serbia's wars since Serbia was a destabilizing influence and a Russian ally. 

But no I don't deny NATO allies committed war crimes as well, in fact the KLA was even designated a terrorist group by the US until just shortly before the intervention. 

However the US wasn't there to achieve any justice, they were there because Serbia an ally of Russia, destabilizing the region, and because its actions in Bosnia, as well as the Rwandan genocide in my opinion, made Americans and Europeans very weary about potentially allowing another genocide to happen. 

&gt;Also I never denied Bosnian warcrimes, it would be stupid to do so. I don't even know why you brought it up.

I didn't mean to imply you would deny it, but its important because when the US was looking and how the Serbian military would conduct itself in Kosovo it of course looked to how it conducted itself in the previous conflict.  Again, Serbia was acting as a destabilizing factor in the region because it lacked the capability to achieve its war goals in a way that didn't involve such horrific violence that only caused more instability.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/cn6etf/on_this_day_in_2008_russia_openly_invaded_georgia/ew9mckp/,MeatsimN64,1565227621

I’ve seen some commentary that Grace 1 no longer had innocent passage because it left the international straits and then dipped back into Gibraltar’s territorial waters to get parts, which is the [justification](https://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/press-releases/grace-1-confirmed-to-be-carrying-full-load-of-crude-oil-5222019-5112) that Gibraltar used, though I’m not an expert to say one way or the other. If you don’t buy this that’s fine, but it’s also the case that Canada is not necessarily in a strong naval position to successfully resist something like a FONOP and thereby enforce its own understanding of what constitutes its territorial waters on other countries. The Canadian naval capability has substantially weakened relative to other nations since the time when it had the world’s third largest fleet following WW2, and my understanding is that the Harper government’s attempt to strengthen it didn’t go incredibly well and that the Trudeau government has not been terribly interested in this either- though, I encourage you to correct me if that’s wrong, as you will be more familiar with your national politics.

Yes, his lies did criticize aspects of the American society unjustly, but the articles were always narrative pieces, like long form New Yorker articles. Everyone knows the author has an opinion, and it's normal that the story is framed to reflect that opinion (lying is not, of course). No one reads those and accepts them as complete reproductions of the whole truth.

Der Spiegel screwed up - big time. By cautiously making up stories and not getting caught at first, getting famous for his ""remarkable"" story telling, Relotius was abele to generate an air of infallibility, much like people say Elizabeth Holmes had. That made him get bolder and stupider.

The export of timber following Norman invasion would had been incredibly minor too, England's woodland's only became exhausted in the 1600s; making the exploitation of Irish woodlands unnecessary prior. Despite this, there was no meaningful change in the rate of deforestation between AD 1000 and 1800.

Perhaps relatively to the supply there was a large export of timber to Britain, but in the larger scope of deforestation, agriculture is and always has been the primary reason for Ireland (and Britain's) state.

The problem is the second part of his proposal. He wants to ban kids unable to speak German to start school and delay enrollment if necessary. Notice that making preschool mandatory is not going to guarantee that all 6-years-olds will be able to speak German when they have to start school. 

For example a family arriving to Germany with a 6-yo from other EU countries, might find themselves unable to put their kid in first year. Or, as other comments have pointed out, it might happen that a kid cannot go to preschool until the last year because the parents can't afford it, and the one free year is not enough for the kid to speak the language, or many other individual circumstances. What are they going to to with those kids? Put them in preschool with smaller kids adding shame to their situation? Put them in special groups isolating them even more? Languages are communication tools, and the best thing to for learning them is making them useful, and if for any reason a child comes to first year without the language, the best thing for them is to join their peers and let them learn.

5344,"&gt; By the  early  centuries  AD  it  would  seem  most  likely  that  much  of  Scotland  had  been  subject  to considerable  deforestation.  In  northernmost  Scotland  and  the  Northern  and  Western  Isles  this  was probably  not achieved  exclusively  through human  agency, but was a consequence of  the combined effects  of  climate  change, soil deterioration,  blanket  peat  growth  and  human  depredation.  Farther south  the  efficacy  of  natural  mechanisms  may  have  been  somewhat  diminished.  It  may  have  been that  in  some  areas  of  southern  Scotland  little  woodland  persisted,  and  that  areas  remaining  to  be cleared  represented  re-growth  from  earlier  prehistoric  clearance.  But  in  central  and  north-central Scotland  some remnants  of  the original woods  survived,  nibbled by  grazing  animals, but  still  to  an extent intact.

&gt; It is evident from the last chapter that at the end of the Middle Ages Scotland felt herself to be in some senses short of wood – certainly short of the kind of large timber necessary for great construction projects on land and sea. The wood of Scotland is ‘utterly destroyed’, declared Parliament in 1503, probably reflecting at least the king’s vexation in not being able to get his hands on the supplies he needed for his castles and ships.

For what the Nazis effectively did with their targets, Polish suffering (punishment for hiding jews, forced labour, etc) was a side-effect, not the purpose.

She just seems to be rather uneducated and makes some stupid mistakes, but I also feel that there are some ""mistakes"" that seem more common in the southern region. 

For example, I think (just from my personal experience, so this may not apply to all) that it is more common for some people in the south to use the singular form of the verb, even though the subject of said verb is in the plural (i.e ""ei face"" instead of ""ei fac"" = ""they do"").

In my region it is more common to use an invariable possessive article (we use ""a"", for example ""a lui, a ei, a lor""), while in the standard language we use a variable one (""a, al, ale, ai"").

In Oltenia, people use the perfect simple way more frequently than we do in the rest of the country (""eu făcui"" vs. the standard ""eu am făcut"" = ""I did"" or ""I made"").

Most of the differences between our dialects occur in the way we pronounce certain words and some lexical differences (i.e ""harbuz"" in Moldavia, ""lubeniță"" in Oltenia and Transylvania, ""pepene verde"" standard, but all mean ""watermelon"").","România, Moldavia",/r/europe/comments/cn342g/the_ruling_party_of_romania_psd_falls_to_3rd/ew6zmss/,CarpathianSparrow,1565183653

5586,"Your comment is exactly the same as my example. I was just putting it into a different context. You're looking at the world as a zero sum game, as if economic expansion is limited only by resource exhaustion. It doesn't work that way.

You and some others are completely focusing on natural resources and ignoring innovation and the economic growth related to it. 

Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources, so it would really behoove you to look into it if you have any interest in this topic. Here's a start:

In the late 18th century, economist Thomas Malthus proposed that population growth in Europe would outstrip the food supply, leading to all kinds of societal problems like revolutions and the overthrow of the ruling classes. He was wrong; it didn't happen that way. The reason why -- innovation and efficiency increases -- is the key to economic growth. We learned to produce more with less.

That process has continued up to the present day. Do you believe that the economic contributions of Microsoft, Google, and Facebook are based mostly on an increase in resource consumption? Of course they aren't; those billions don't come from producing widgets on an assembly line. Most of that income stems from technological innovation. Such businesses would have been unthinkable in the 18th century, and yet now they are cornerstones of our modern economies.",,/r/europe/comments/cn2b86/scary_german_output_figures_add_to_recession/ew70ph5/,aj_potc,1565184187

5709,"&gt; Aren't many of those ships just dingies on a one way trip?

Largely, no.

To be exact - those departing Tunisia are. Their job is basically to leave the Tunisian SAR zone and make it to Maltese or Italian where Italian and Maltese navy can't offsource the interception to anyone else and thus have to bring them to Lampedusa / Malta. Or, better yet, to make it all the way to Lampedusa port itself. As such, Tunisian smugglers buy old fisher boats, overcrowd them and send them on their way. These are unsafe as it gets due to weight, but their engines have sufficient power to make it to Lampedusa in ideal conditions.

From Libya, until very recently you had dinghies that you speak about that never had even theoretical chance to make it to Malta or Lampedusa and so smugglers MO was to also give migrants on boat one sat phone with phone number. Back during Renzi days this was phone number of MRCC Rome, because Italy was responsible for Libyan SAR zone. That is over a year not the case, so they give them Alarm Phone NGO number which then contacts any NGO ship in vicinity and also Rome / Valetta MRCC. Then what happens is race for interception as Rome calls Tripoli and Tripoli dispatches a Patrol Boat. If there is NGO ship in vicinity, it races to that position as well. If Libyan ship makes it, those migrants are taken to Libya. If NGO ship does, the usual happens.

But lately smugglers in Libya, for premium price, has started to dispatch old fishing boats because now they also aim for deliverance directly to Maltese / Italian SAR zone, while before they only had to get to international waters. Those cases aren't that numerous due to various reasons (eg in town of Zwarah 2 years back there was war triggered by armed citizenry storming militia barrack that was in cahoot with smugglers as they were essentially running a mafia rig in town and making lives of Joe Regulars pretty shit .... but every Joe Regular in Libya has an AK and RPG so they kicked back and hauled some ass, ever since departures from Zwarah dropped to nada).",Slovakia,/r/europe/comments/cn208o/italys_government_wins_confidence_vote_on_decree/ew6h53b/,Niikopol,1565169259

The ruling of the tribunal regarding the sea border makes no reference to historical ownership or historical claims - I suggest you actually read it. You've simply added your own opinion and tried to pass it off as fact. The arbitration does reference historical borders and claims regarding the land border, but not the sea.

For what its worth, I agree that Croatia should abide by the ruling and get this matter done with. But despite the controls put into place to undo any (potential) damage caused by Slovenia's transgressions, the Croatian government is still hanging onto this  lack of trust and foul play to not commit. Slovenia essentially handed Croatia the excuse they were looking for, and they are going to use it for all its worth. Im not necessarily agreeing with Croatia's actions or saying they are the proper way to handle this issue, but at least acknowledge that Slovenia's behaviour contributed to this situation.

The flaw of the whole NUTS approach can also be felt at borders.

Yes, the UK pays more money than they get back in terms of support. This is true for most members of the EU. The benefit of being an EU member for countries like Germany, Holland, France, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, the UK, Belgium and so on, does not lie in the amount of money that is being pumped back. 

**The EU is not a lottery where a bunch of countries pump in money, and then see who get to take the most money out again.**

The 350m, or 390m, pounds that the UK pays for upkeep to the EU is nothing compared to the boost to the british economy it gives to be a member. When leaving the EU, it's not like that money becomes free to use for anything. The loss in revenue generated elsewhere means there will be LESS money in total for the UK to spend on whatever they want, the NHS for example. 

Nobody has said the UK does not pay 350m to the EU. The lie is that it would be possible to use that money for something else if the UK leaves. Get it yet? It's a blatant lie to trick people like yourself to vote leave, without understanding anything about the subject. 

The fact that economists all said that it was a lie didn't matter, because people (like yourself) would rather believe what *sounds* good than what it the truth. Unfortunately, just because you wish something to be true does not make it so. 

So, there you have it. Hope you understand better now. Next time please look up what a politician says and if it can be true before giving him his vote.

My niece was even sent to a Kindergarden that was multilingual - German and Spanish, and she learned to speak German as well as some simple Spanish.  
The problem is probably if children come from migrant families who don't provide that level of support to their children - be it because they can't since they don't speak German well enough to teach it or because they don't care. In that case it is the public responsibility to intervene and provide some sort of assistance to the children.

5877,"&gt;Tatars from Tatarstan or Bashkiria. 

Tatar isn't just a term used for Tatars of Tatarstan. 

&gt;and their history, language and culture is similar to that of Turkey's.

Their language is under the Cuman branch of Kipchak, while Tatarstan Tatars and Bashkirs do speak languages under the Bulgar branch of Kipchak, and Nogay Tatars do speak another branch under Kipchak. Turkey speaks a language under the Oghuz branch. Like seriously? 

They also don't claim to be the same with Tatarstan, but Nogais, Tatars and Crimean Tatars are all Tatars, since they have continued to call themselves as such when Mongols with Turkic army core marched their way down with hordes.

&gt;During World War II, more Crimean Tatars collaborated with German occupation forces than Crimean Tatars fighting in the Russian military and resistance. They deserted from units of the Russian army and went over to the German occupation. They formed Tatar collaborationist units that fought against the Russian army.

&gt;And it was decided to resettle the Crimean Tatars to Uzbekistan. The government accommodated them with shelter, jobs and other necessities. Males between 17 and 45 deported before the spring of 1945 had a better chance to survive in exile than they would have had if drafted into the military. The resettling of the Crimean Tatars was a tough measure that took place in the context of the most violent war in history. 

Here comes the justifications of them being mass deported, genocided and their country being destroyed.

First, Crimean Tatars had no moral obligation to choose between Stalinist Russia or iii. Reich, both of whom were occupiers in their lands.

Secondly, Stalin mass deported anyone he seen as a threat. This included nations that hadn't had any SS units, any collaborators or even haven't been invaded by iii. Reich. If this is your argument and justification, you can call a mass deportation and colonisation on Russians and Ukranians, and destruction of these countries with your brilliance.

Russia also haven't accommodated them with much but simply watch them die. Russia also colonised their lands, give away their homes and properties like it did to many other nations Stalin had mass deported and genocided, with or without them producing Nazi collaborator units. They weren't even alone in Crimea, but the other native Crimean population, Crimean Greeks, also faced the same horror. They also haven't sent collaborators or males, but the whole nation, up to their last individual including ones fought for the Soviet Army. Nice justification attempt you have there. 

&gt; It was quite likely that had the resettlement not taken place, Russian people in Crimea victimized by genocide that Crimean Tatar collaborationist units were guilty of perpetrating would have taken 

Like Russia mass deporting and genociding Chechen-Ingush you mean, and destroying their countries? Where Nazis even haven't made to Chechnya or Ingushetia, and even the rebel Chechen-Ingush leader was defying iii. Reich openly?

Or you mean like Crimean Greeks or Caucasian Greeks?

Russia did what Imperial Russia does, meaning mass deporting and genociding people, and colonising their lands. 

&gt; revenge against Crimean Tatars similar to what was seen throughout Europe in the immediate post-war period.

If it's to have any long-term hope of surviving it needs to change a lot I think. For example when it comes to its goals and its role in the world. We were told it was about cooperation, about making Europe stronger, about European interests etc. and then we continue to fuck ourselves over to act like a charity for the third world.

5978,"&gt;You pretend like this isn't happening in Italy on a much bigger scale mate. You have your own AfD in gouverment, the Agnellis have been stricked into corruption since forever, Unicredit just paid a billion dollar fine for money laundering and ENI has been paying fines for corruption left right and center when they weren't just having dinner with Gaddafi or Libyan warlords. That's not even talking about Mafia Capitale, the fact that ex-Mayors of every big italian town have gone to jail for corruption in recent years, corruption in football and Bancopoli. 

I think you managed to get this all wrong.

I'm saying, the funding AfD gets or bribes your politicians get would be my later concern. Your whole banking system is corrupt. It's a scheme that made tons of proofs out of a sizeable part of EU and even with crisis they have caused with other banks, they continued to do so. Your politicians backed this, and your very state profited out of it let alone your banks, even when things were its worst. That's not recorded on any corruption report of course. Your banks are also responsible for tax evasion and at the centre of the largest tax evasion scandals of EU. Your own very banks also made your whole country a hub to launder Russian dirty money, mafia money and any kind of black money. Heck, your politicians even get bribed for laundering Azerbaijani dirty money. Your financial system even went with schemes for mortgages and made tons of money out of it up to mortgage crisis in the US.

Tell me more about how you're comparing these with Italy, and how some mayors being corrupt is actually a larger scale of corruption. Your whole financial system is notorious for schemes and laundering. Your all large corps are cheating and corrupt. Good luck with finding any equivalents. 

&gt;Well except that isn't really true is it? Plus where do you draw this from? Your extensive knowledge about corruption in Germany? 

From what I've said. Read about your own country a bit more, if you lack the knowledge on your banking system, your own govt backing those, and your own industry being pretty corrupt.

Good luck with the ""we are better"" mindset. If you want to fool yourself with your own corruption that can't compete with anywhere in the EU, I can't help you.",An Adjar born in Tuscany,/r/europe/comments/clzje4/salvini_trying_to_challenge_berlusconis_legacy/ew67vs3/,adjarteapot,1565157272

Either way that makes no sense. Every market has effective options for every group of consumers. I have already explained the reason why a market for lower-income doesn't exist in this sector because the government forces people to pay for these home through taxes then offers it for no optional cost while the private entities don't get the same coerced resources and they can't give away their products for free. This obviously means people choose public housing.

This isn't a fair competition and destroys anyone who was specialized in making low-income homes.
