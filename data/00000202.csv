51,"I don't have too much pity, Germany's severe economic problems were self-inflicted.

Germany anticipated the war as being an opportunity to loot the Allied Powers and seize their land, to carve out a sphere of influence for itself. Since they figured that they would be fabulously wealthy from the adventure, they decided to fund their invasions by taking out a series of massive loans- less for the people to complain about than raising taxes, and if the numbers got a bit high they could just extort the conquered that much more when they won. Then they didn't; oops.

So now while Germany &amp; company had been forced to surrender due to their untenable position, there was the matter that they had not actually fought the war on their own territory. They *had* managed to turn the most prosperous parts of France and much of Belgium into a moonscape where they hadn't burned down or looted it. While it was recognized that the Central Powers could not pay enough to restore what was lost, it was not unreasonable to demand the relatively untouched Central Powers should provide some assistance to the victorious countries that they had devastated.

So came the London Schedule of Payments in 1921 after some years of compromise, which was at the minimum that the public would tolerate in the affected countries such as France and Belgium. This sum was 132 billion gold marks to be paid over 30 years, the equivalent of $33 billion USD at the time and thus about $450 billion modern USD. To be sure, that's a big number- about 14% of the US government's revenue in 2017, approaching the budget for the military in that year! However, Germany was never expected to actually pay the full amount.

There were three series of bonds in the schedule, these being A, B and C bonds. A and B were to be mandatory for Germany to pay and constituted 50 billion gold marks, while C bonds were to be evaluated on the ability of the German government's ability to pay them; this was basically a way for politicians to tell their constituents that they were making Germans pay the 132 billion gold marks in the mean time to satisfy the public opinion but leaving off the 82 billion gold marks beyond what German representatives said that they could pay. This takes us down to about what the US spent on its Air Force in 2017.

Now, you may wonder why I've been specifying gold marks. The German Empire had left the gold standard for the war, and so Weimar was also on a system of paper marks. The Allied Powers were concerned that Germany would just print billions of marks for minimal cost and eat hyperinflation just to spite them with worthless currency, so they made sure that Germany could pay in almost anything but paper marks- gold, foreign currency, or in kind (ex. by the land that had swapped hands, coal exports, that sort of thing.) Germany's brilliant leaders saw a way around this by deciding to spite the Allied Powers by printing ridiculous amounts of paper marks to buy foreign currency and then use that to pay- while the scheme briefly helped them to buy large amounts of foreign currency with their now-overvalued paper marks, the window ran out when other countries got wise and Germany was left with a self-inflicted worthless currency. Bear in mind, they did not need to actually do this; the German industry had still been left intact, the huge cost of the military that had been borne by prior German governments was reduced to minimal amounts.

Unable to get cash payments then, the Allied Powers are asking for payments in kind, such as by coal or timber shipments. Germany defaults many times, willfully refusing to pay what they owed- bear in mind, many of these regular payments were based on what the *Germans* had proposed to pay and that the Allied Powers had reduced their quotas to so that they could get something to rebuild with rather than nothing. Even when it was agreed to pay Germany five marks per ton of coal as a means of encouraging this payment, Germany still shipped at only the most irregular intervals.

The French were especially upset because they relied on this promised coal, as many of their own coal mines had been destroyed in the war. Their flagging industry depended on these shipments, and Germany was just not paying- and so, France with Belgium occupied the Rhineland. This was not terribly profitable because of the cost of occupation, but the French had recognized that Germany did not see itself as a defeated country, and that if no action was taken Germany would feel no obligation to obey any other part of the treaties it had signed. However, this move alienated France from the Anglo powers that wanted a more lenient peace that would encourage German trade; after all, France cares about the reconstruction of French territory, the British and the Americans not so much when there is wealth from trade to be had.

So then we get to the Dawes Plan. Allied Powers got together an approach that ended up more in line with the American position- the German bank would be reorganized because the existing one had proven itself utterly incapable, and a tremendous amount of American capital was injected into the country via loans to jumpstart the economy. This did cause a splendid economy and for a time Germany met its obligations. Soon came the Young plan which halved the German payments needed each year to make the burden lighter and set the end date of payments all the way out in 1988, and to help the German government was provided with even more loans. France's occupation was ended, and with it the French steel industry took a nasty hit because they no longer had the coal to fuel it while Germany's took off with the new investment.

Then the Great Depression happened, and obviously as Germany had so many US loans it got hit rather hard. Germany said that they weren't paying any more reparations, and over the protests of the French a moratorium on the payments was agreed to by the Allied Powers; as the situation degraded the Lausanne conference was called and Germany's war reparations ended up being cancelled after one last payment.

In total Germany paid the equivalent of about 20 billion gold marks over the course of about a dozen years. Averaged out, that's about paying the revenue collected by the state of Ethiopia in 2017 for each of those years. Not a commitment one would willingly jump into, to be sure, but not intolerably hefty for one of the richest countries on the planet with a correspondingly massive industry.

Now think about how the Germans had been acting not only during the war, but prior to it. The 1870 Treaty of Frankfurt that annexed Alsace-Lorraine to Germany also had the French pay an indemnity of 5 billion francs in five years (none of it permitted in kind, but rather in various foreign currencies). This total was about $340 billion in modern USD; the French said that they could only pay 30% of that, so the newly formed Germany essentially said ""vae victis"" and decided to occupy the capital and industrial heartlands of the country until the money was paid, intending to cripple France for decades to come.

Unlike the Germans, the French paid off their debt in full within five years and fully adhered to its terms regarding subjects such as trade up until the outbreak of the next war between them. Unlike the Germans, the French didn't take this as an excuse to run rampaging across Europe killing millions. Versailles was not as harsh as you think, certainly not when the Allied Powers negotiated it down. Or, for that matter, in comparison to what the Germans had planned and even executed; see Brest-Litovsk as the example that Germany presented to the world of what it wanted to do with its own foes. Versailles is therefore no excuse for what Germany would go on to do in WW2.",,/r/europe/comments/9uxond/today_101_years_ago_the_bolsheviks_led_an_armed/ea332ie/,sparkling_uranium,1542692166

‚ÄúPRESS for progress‚Äù is the theme of this year‚Äôs International Women‚Äôs Day on March 8th. As our sixth glass-ceiling index shows, disparity between countries remains wide. But women have made some progress towards equality in the workplace in the past year.

The index ranks the best and worst countries to be a working woman. Each score is based on average performance in ten indicators: educational attainment, labour-market attachment, pay, child-care costs, maternity and paternity rights, business-school applications and representation in senior jobs (in managerial positions, on company boards and in parliament). 

Equality-conscious Nordics typically do well while workplace parity for women in Japan, South Korea and Turkey still lags badly. America under President Donald Trump rose from 20th to 19th place thanks in part to a higher female labour-force participation rate. This year Sweden ranks first, scoring well in female labour-force participation, which is over 80%, and the share of women in parliament (44%). 

Women broadly lifted their presence in the workplace. There has been an increase in the share of women in the labour force, with a tertiary education and of those taking business-school entrance exams, which are a pipeline for senior executive jobs. Yet advances may be slower than anticipated. MSCI, a financial-data firm, has pushed back its estimate by a year to 2028 for when the global share of women on boards will hit 30% (the figure is now 17.3%). 

Countries at the bottom of our index show signs of change in cultural attitudes. Last year the Global Summit of Women, a business and economic gathering of over 1,300 leaders from 60-odd countries, was held in Japan for the first time. The #MeToo movement, a social-media campaign against sexual assault and harassment, arrived in South Korea with fervour. Allegations of inappropriate behaviour against senior prosecutors, chaebol owners and board members there have since come to light as more women are feeling empowered.

It turns out that erosion is actually a thing that needs to be taken into account when looking at how costs develop.

There are also long term trends that need to take into account that the earth we walk on is far more elastic than we would normally think and that removing many, many tons of glacial ice from some places and adding many, many tons of water in others will deform the very earth beneath it and make some parts of it rise and other sink.

W. B. Yeats, 1865 - 1939


 A sudden blow: the great wings beating still

Above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed


By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,


He holds her helpless breast upon his breast.

How can those terrified vague fingers push


The feathered glory from her loosening thighs?


And how can body, laid in that white rush,


But feel the strange heart beating where it lies?

A shudder in the loins engenders there


The broken wall, the burning roof and tower


And Agamemnon dead.

Being so caught up,


So mastered by the brute blood of the air,


Did she put on his knowledge with his power


Before the indifferent beak could let her drop?

_____

I just thought to ask about this, 'cause I haven't really seen much discussion about it, and I can't really find anything useful on this topic beyond the same paragraph on Wikipedia quoted anywhere the term shows up, but: **Graded-Z shielding**

The entry describes its ability to deal with gamma radiation:

&gt; It also absorbs gamma rays, which produces X-ray fluorescence. Each subsequent layer absorbs the X-ray fluorescence of the previous material, eventually reducing the energy to a suitable level.

However, this is mostly for satellite usage, and I couldn't find any real numbers for layer thickness and composition and how it would deal with harder (?) gamma emissions from stuff like decaying ^(233)Pa. 

I haven't had any luck finding *pricing* info on it either, but I'd imagine its primary usage in *satellite shielding* probably doesn't bode well for the affordability of any existing implementations on the market.

So I don't know if the stuff could make for viable shielding with multiple ""layers"" of the stuff, or even if it could lessen the amount of lead or steel needed around a decay tank.

For all I know, it would have all the usefulness of adding a $5,000 laptop to a terawatt render farm 'cause ""it has a CPU too!"".

165,"&gt; No, he doesn't. A you really that obtuse? He says ""equip Europe for future challenges"", by which he means ""re-work the institutional framework to address the problems on our hands"", of which there are plenty.

And it is done *only* by France and Germany. They are the ones that decide for everyone else. We all know how it is in the EU: everyone else gets to vote on what the EU proposed, but if you get the wrong result then you're told to vote again until you get the correct result.

&gt;Nobody has even bothered to hammer out the details, and yet all you hear is ""we'll order anyone around"". Which frankly is ridiculous and lacks any evidence at this point.

His own words say that. *You* even outlined that in your post. I'll put it in a full sentence for you:

&gt;France and Germany should re-work the institutional framework of Europe to address the problems on our hands.

How can you read this and not understand how it's France and Germany deciding for everyone else?!

&gt;Ireland had a second referendum on the treaty after they managed to get vital concessions out of the EU. 

And those concessions consisted of Ireland being able to keep their low corporate taxes and a permanent commissioner. Why would the EU agree to something like that if it wasn't their idea? We're not even 10 years past that point and we've heard many calls from the EU about how the tax situation in Ireland can't remain.

If it's such a debunked point then why are there MEPs that are calling for a [2nd Brexit referendum](https://www.politico.eu/article/german-mep-calls-for-second-brexit-vote/)? If this isn't how things are done then why would an MEP say that?

The Netherlands and France also rejected the EU constitution proposal in a referendum. A few years later it was simply renamed to the Lisbon Treaty and pushed onto them anyway.

&gt;But for fucks sake, be critical about real problems, not imaginary ones, and don't ever let your own irrationality get the better of you.

Issues of sovereignty are the realest problems get. The main difference between Eastern Europe and Western Europe in the 20th century was the question of sovereignty. The countries that could make most of their decisions themselves prospered and the ones that didn't will be playing catch up for at least another 30-50 years, *if* they are allowed to catch up.

251,"While I agree with you, People have problem with Grabowski because he did some questionable things in his research, for example Grabowski said that Polish people are directly and indirectly responsible for deaths of 200,000 jewish people, the thing is that its not based on evidence but on assumption that 10% of the Jews escaped from the Gettos - but this is only a guess and estimate - there is no evidence of how much has escaped. It might as well be 1%(I am not saying that it was this low number, but without having evidence backing number believed to survived you cant say for sure how many polish people killed).

Another questionable thing is that when doing research he gathered info from least developed regions of country, he made research based on 9 regions that ALL were on eastern side of Poland, where largest number of uneducated people lived, and also large minorites from east of Poland, from regions where before pogroms against jews happen(some of those regions arent now even part of poland).
I wouldnt have problem with his research if choosen regions for research randomly, both from west and east side of country, doing that way would prevent result of research be distorted by  factors like differences of education in regions.

294,"&gt; Grabowski said that Polish people are directly and indirectly responsible for deaths of 200,000 jewish people,

Well, his math seems fuzzy, I agree with that. However, my perception is that many people will have a problem with Grabowski even if he has guessed 200. For psychological reasons, it seems like everything above 0 damage the narrative of Polish people as the victims in the WWII. 

&gt; he made research based on 9 regions that ALL were on eastern side of Poland

Was not the eastern side where most of the extermination took place? I mean, if that's right, I could totally see why he decided to focus his research there. 

Leaving Grabowski's research on the side, I think a proper qualitative examination of the errors from the past is important. For instance, Spain recognizing that the expulsion of Jews in the XVI century was a mistake was a step in the right direction. Contrarily, the continuous negative of the Mexican government, and people, of the systematic discrimination against Asian immigrants in the first part of the XX century is morally wrong.

It seems to me like for many in Poland to accept that the Polish population had antisemitic feelings too and that they played a role in the genocide is equal to insult the nation. In my opinion, the opposite would be more damming, negating the collaboration in the Holocaust is harming and mostly a lie people like to say to each other.

We're 40 years past the fact now, but I think it's easy for people to forget that Spain was walking the fine line between another Civil War and a peaceful transition when it did the transition. The Bunker, as the hardliners in the regime were called, didn't want anything to do with Spain becoming a democracy while the current king was facing sympathetic to democracy and also facing pressure to do so from the ""liberal"" elements of the regime. It was a fine line since the Bunker and the army was willing to toss Juan Carlos to the side if he transitioned. And they almost did when they staged coups.

&gt;  
&gt;2.The rights referred to in paragraph 1 shall leave intact and shall in no way affect any rights provided for in Union law to authors and other rightholders, in respect of the works and other subject-matter incorporated in a press publication. Such rights may not be invoked against those authors and other rightholders and, in particular, may not deprive them of their right to exploit their works and other subject-matter independently from the press publication in which they are incorporated.  
&gt;  
&gt;3.Articles 5 to 8 of Directive 2001/29/EC and Directive 2012/28/EU shall apply mutatis mutandis in respect of the rights referred to in paragraph 1.  
&gt;  
&gt;4.The rights referred to in paragraph 1 shall expire 20 years after the publication of the press publication. This term shall be calculated from the first day of January of the year following the date of publication.

Sure we do, we raise them here, and thanks to us joining the EU, they have easier time going to Western Europe than they have going to the USA for example. So by choosing to be part of the EU, we have diverted the larger flow to you.

&gt;**GOBBY Irish PM Leo Varadkar has no idea how much damage he does with every Brexit utterance.** His latest salvo **revealed a patronising, pompous arrogance as misplaced as it was sickening.** The mighty EU won‚Äôt change its rules for little Britain, Varadkar sneered.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre 27 member states ‚Äî the UK is one country,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre 500million people, the UK is 60million. That basic fact has to be understood.‚ÄùThe Sun has some more basic facts:Ireland‚Äôs population is 4.8million. The UK‚Äôs is 66.5million.Ireland‚Äôs economy relies on us so heavily that a ‚Äúno deal‚Äù is forecast to throw 2.5 per cent of its workforce on the dole. It is far more exposed than any other EU country, or the UK.Our billions bailed out broke Ireland in 2010. Has Varadkar forgotten?Is he happy to sour relations with millions of UK customers with long memories, who may take against Irish goods? **A wiser man would have acted as peacemaker, constructively helping both sides forge a historic deal in all our interests**, including those of his country and its wonderful people. **Instead he chose another role . . . as the snivelling suck-up egging on the playground bullies.**


And before anyone tries to qualify it as *only* being the Sun, this sentiment was on display in the express and the Daily Mail and don't forget that the Sun is the [most widely circulated paper in the U.K](https://www.statista.com/statistics/529060/uk-newspaper-market-by-circulation/).

&gt;Fact is that Germany manages to absorb immigrants - coming first and foremost from Eastern Europe - in numbers that are FAR greater than those that pose supposedly insurmountable problems for the UK.

And in the fact of the matters is that you have done through a far larger time period and the UK have absorbed more immigrants from the EU as a whole. ",,/r/europe/comments/9yg82a/may_says_brexit_will_stop_eu_nationals_being_able/ea218w0/,salvibalvi,1542659803

What exactly does the EU want that isn't tied as a condition to something the UK wants? Something that the EU just wants for itself and will actively pursue? 

The only thing that comes to mind is the rights of EU nationals in the UK, which we already discussed the EU offered to grant UK nationals the privileges they had until now.

I suppose the border in Ireland, is one, which does necessitate some degree of control. The UK is supposedly also committed to making sure there's no border with Ireland.

3. If true, the immigration rate for Poles to Germany should be much higher than for Poles to the UK after those restrictions were lifted.

It's simply factual that the Polish population in Germany have come over a much longer period. As mentioned the majority were there even before Germany joined the EU.

No idea yet again. But: How is that relevant? 

&gt;Actually it is about Germany as the debate was about how much better other EU members (like Germany) had been at restricting the immigration from those countries. 

Very much not so.

This here is about the double British hypocrisy: Complaining about unrestricted migration rates when the UK actually **was** at liberty to restrict them. And complaining about ""unmanageable"" Polish migration rates even though they are at a fraction of what hardly even makes news in Germany.

551,"&gt; The UK wants to keep access to the common market

The UK was conducting trade in Europe long before the EU ever came along.  That is not something that the EU brought to the table.  As an American for example if a local company wants to conduct trade with a German country that is fine by me but I consider the national level negotiation to be between the US and Germany.  If Germany wants to add complexity to the relationship by making the US go thru some other organization then I think Germany should inherently make a concession to compensate the US for having to go thru some other organization.  
    

Agreed, it is not clear to me what exactly each side is saying but my general view is that the UK should post Brexit have the same rights and obligations to trade in the EU as say Korea or the US or Japan or any other non-EU country.  

If either the UK or the EU is asking for more rights or influence with the other than that then it should be amicably negotiated and the side asking for special rights or concessions should be prepared to give up something in return.  I would say that to both the UK and EU.

597,"&gt; I'm stating that even if a law can't be enforced in a particular instance, it doesn't mean that the law has not been broken or that the law is invalid

But does also not mean ""the government is doing nothing"" because that's exactly what usually follows this ""let us count all the illegals as liberally as possible"". You even did it up there yourself when you said:

&gt;  but the state is *unwilling* or unable to enforce it

The state enforced that classification because not every ""geduldeter"" automatically stays an ""illegal"" or gets actually deported. It's a process where peoples status isn't fixed, it can varry between 4 different ones with a ""schutztitel"".

The way you are trying to lump all these up, to generalize them all as ""illegals"" is completely ignoring these very important intricacies. You can try to auto-translate [this article](http://faktenfinder.tagesschau.de/inland/auslaender-in-deutschland-101.html) for some more in-depth explanation and actual up to date numbers. But that ""500.000-600.000 illegals in Germany!"" number is a **lie** popularized by the AfD.

Actually ""illegal"", as in had their asylum application denied, didn't get a duldung and are in the process of being deported, are 61.254 people.

Then there's 171.584 people in ""duldung"", which again: Isn't just ""soon to be deported"" but can also change in status in the other direction, it's a highly fluctuating number. [For contrast](https://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/DE/Publikationen/WorkingPapers/wp27-grunddaten.pdf?__blob=publicationFile): At the end of 2008 there were 103.218 people with ""duldung"" in Germany, down from 127.903 at the end of 2017.

Back then a lot of those were Afghani and Iraqi people, and guess what? Germany is still here, over a decade later.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/9ye6ub/macron_europe_must_prevent_global_chaos/ea1t1yw/,Nethlem,1542653438

&gt;There are almost 10,000 species of birds and only around 3 percent of them have a penis. These include ducks, geese and swans, and large flightless birds like ostriches and emus.

This should finally clear up all the questions everyone here has been asking about why it was never Leda and the chicken. The chicken is a dickless bird, understand shitbird? The male chicken is called a cock, that's only because God has a sense of irony. Also before you ask the reason why Zeus didn't use an emu was because they hadn't discovered Australia yet.

I was very pleased to see that after the publication of my book or Jan Tomasz Gross‚Äôs book you could see that Polish intellectuals are ready to re-examine the past.
&gt;
&gt; For many parts of the Polish society it is very difficult, since for decades they were victims themselves, first of the Nazis and then of the Communists. If you look at the countries around Poland, such as Ukraine or the Baltic states, you will not find the same level of public debate about their relationship with their own Jewish minority.

&gt; **Q.:** Are you not worried that revealing the responsibility of Polish peasants for the murder of many Jews will increase the perception of Poland as an anti-Semitic country?
&gt;
&gt; **Grabowski:** That is the reason why in the last two chapters of my book I bring the stories of Poles, who despite the negative image of Jews and the enormous pressure from their relatives took a huge risk in hiding them. It is undeniable that certain things have happened but you must understand the atmosphere in which it happened.
&gt;
&gt; I emphasize the heroism of those who risked their lives to hide Jews from the Nazis, and did so despite the pressure exerted on them from their relatives and neighbors.
&gt;
&gt; We should all remember that the Germans were responsible for this tragedy; it is they who murdered most of the three million Jews who lived in Poland before World War II. My book explains how the Germans were able to mobilize segments of the Polish society to take part in their plan to hunt down the Jews and help them carry out their Final Solution.",,/r/europe/comments/9yfqxi/holocaust_researcher_files_libel_lawsuit_against/ea1iydr/,nilsz,1542645732

There were lots of Poles coming to Germany. In the 80s and 90s. When Poland entered the EU Germany decided to restrict their migration to manageable numbers, so only about 100k were accepted in the beginning. That's because at the same time Germany had to absorb huge numbers of migrants from Russia. 

These days Poles are the second largest migrant group, right after the Turks. Nobody cares because hardly anyone ever notices. Two of my direct neighbours happen to be Polish. The worst thing I can say about them is that one of them sometimes likes to vacuum her car a bit too long for my liking.

&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article162762852/Warum-556-000-abgelehnte-Asylbewerber-in-Deutschland-bleiben.html](https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article162762852/Warum-556-000-abgelehnte-Asylbewerber-in-Deutschland-bleiben.html)

That article ain't only nearly 2 years old by now, it's numbers were already doubtful back then because it's not actually counting people but proceedings. Not every denied application for asylum automatically translates into some person needing to be forcefully removed, just like not every suspended deportation does equal an ""illegal being illegal in Germany"".

[Case in point](http://faktenfinder.tagesschau.de/inland/auslaender-in-deutschland-101.html):

&gt;So waren zum Stichtag 30. April 2018 bundesweit 232.838 Ausl√§nder ausreisepflichtig, wie eine BAMF-Sprecherin dem *ARD-faktenfinder* mitteilte. Davon hatten 171.584 Personen eine Duldung. **Bleiben 61.254 abgelehnte Asylbewerber ohne Duldung in Deutschland - sie gelten als ""vollziehbar ausreisepflichtig"".**

Weird how out of those 556.000 to 600.000 ""illegals"" only around 60.000 actual ""illegals"" are in need of deportation. Exaggerating the real number by a factor of nearly 10, that's quite bold!

You're missing the point. In year 1918 is celebrated as **establishment** of independent state of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (though we're a bit different since prior to year 1795 we were an independent state) and then were is year 1990-01 **re-establishment** of independence which is also celebrated.

E.g.: [The Act of Reinstating Independence of Lithuania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Independence_of_Lithuania) (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Valstybƒós atk≈´rimo aktas) or Act of 16 February was signed by the Council of Lithuania on 16 February 1918, proclaiming the restoration of an independent State of Lithuania.

[The Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania or Act of March 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_the_Re-Establishment_of_the_State_of_Lithuania) (Lithuanian: Aktas dƒól Lietuvos nepriklausomos valstybƒós atstatymo) was an independence declaration by the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic adopted on March 11, 1990, signed by all[1] members of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania led by SƒÖj≈´dis. The act emphasized restoration and legal continuity of the interwar-period Lithuania, which was occupied by the USSR and lost independence in June 1940. It was the first time that a Union Republic declared independence from the dissolving Soviet Union.

957,"&gt; 6 But Jesus has now obtained a more excellent ministry, and to that degree he is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted through better promises. 7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need to look for a second one.

&gt; 8 God finds fault with them when he says:

&gt;‚ÄòThe days are surely coming, says the Lord,
    when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel
    and with the house of Judah;
9 not like the covenant that I made with their ancestors,
    on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt;
for they did not continue in my covenant,
    and so I had no concern for them, says the Lord.
10 This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel
    after those days, says the Lord:
I will put my laws in their minds,
    and write them on their hearts,
and I will be their God,
    and they shall be my people.
11 And they shall not teach one another
    or say to each other, ‚ÄúKnow the Lord‚Äù,
for they shall all know me,
    from the least of them to the greatest.
12 For I will be merciful towards their iniquities,
    and I will remember their sins no more.‚Äô

&gt;13 In speaking of ‚Äòa new covenant‚Äô, he has made the first one obsolete. And what is obsolete and growing old will soon disappear.

Hebrews 8:6-13

&gt;31 The days are surely coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah. 32 It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt‚Äîa covenant that they broke, though I was their husband,[a] says the Lord. 33 But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 34 No longer shall they teach one another, or say to each other, ‚ÄòKnow the Lord‚Äô, for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, says the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquity, and remember their sin no more.

1045,"&gt;It's hardly an inner circle when the various members of the EU are free to enter the exact same agreement

That will be OK if true but I don't think is the case. I mean if we look at the Schengen area I see that Romania (and Bulgaria) are still kept out of it because Holland (and to quite some extent Germany) have their own comercial interests at Black Sea and Romania didn't bow to them in that regard.

I see no reasons why Germany and France won't use the same tactics if they split EU in various ""speeds"" and circles. I see no reason for most of EE (and some WE) countries to drift from NATO and a solid defence alliance with US and form a still hypothetical so called EU army when is obvious France and Germany interests in this regard are not similar with the others (especially EE but some WE too) and they either did just some symbolic gestures either acted outright hostile to EE in relation with Russia, and in general disregarded EE vital security interests for some rather shallow or shadowy individual economical and political ties with same Russia. 

As of now the direction this EU project seems to take is one inspired by the former Habsburgic empire, with a central core who rules over various outward circles kept under control and less developed and exploited but who don't actually have much in common as culture, society, spirituality and common goals.

It was a frankenstein type entity that crumbled with first occasion with most of its parts just waiting to rip it in pieces and going in their own ways. I am afraid that such dumb historical concept and take on things will actually blow up the last chance of Europe to become a relevant world power and presence in world affairs.

How I see the things is that France and Germany should imediatly renounce to stir EU as their vechicle for a desireable rule of Europe by themselves because that will fail in an ugly way. They should cut down their influence and start an approach more similar with an updated Roman Republic (even empire) approach, which was the last successful pan-European entity and the last time Europe was the actual leading world power from all points of view. That should be the common denominator for most EU nations from historical and cultural pov and the source of inspiration for an eventual EU confederation and super-state, lead by a central government elected across all EU for a specific period of time (even a consul if you wish, as a sort of president) and local governs in a more decentralized manner (like ancient Roman governors, just democratically elected localy, not named by the emperor or central Senate)

Is needed a real common goal and some common background to unite all EU countries under the same flag and that flag definitely isn't France or Germany lead alliance despite as much as some people there dream to. You simply can provide a serious influence that can win the hearts and minds across EU. I mean English (mostly due to US however) is the most common used language in Europe and either that should stay or we introduce lets say Latin for EU administration and a future hypothetically EU military, and eventually have a sort of common variant of it as EU most common language. Neither French or German language are able to become this common language for various reasons

Is needed an equal development across EU even if that means Germany, France etc will need to cut down their profits and transfer them or allow others (mostly EE) to rise close to their levels. Is needed a common foreign policy and acknowledgement of whats the main danger for EU, if you go by very narrow national (or even some too big to fail national companies) interests you're bound to upset others and eventually get rejected.",,/r/europe/comments/9y6jlw/in_a_speech_to_germanys_parliament_french/ea0vpm2/,duras2,1542616903

In a few years time, when their growth will come back to Earth, they will be able to spend a lot more resources on quality control. Also, the new age of cars isn't just about the hardware. It's also software. Tesla has a huge leap in software over the established cars and they are unlikely to give that up. It's a vertical integration model.

1348,"&gt; You're right, but Russians make up 81% of Russia. China is 91% Han Chinese. Ottoman Empire was more like 30% Turkish (not 10%, I was wrong). So it's not the same at all.

""was"" is the key word here. If Turkey had control over the Balkans today you would form a much more significant percentage as the Russians do in Russia, Also unlike Russia or China the Ottomans were able to use Islam and the concept of the Ummah to greatly quell much of the Muslim population of your Empire 


&gt; Clearly, Izmir and Western Thrace are given to Greece, much of the rest of Turkey is divided between other countries. Right, Britain really wanted Turkish territorial integrity. You guys sure as hell helped with attacking us too, especially the Aegean coastal cities like during the Gallipoli campaign. Wasn't until you also had your ass kicked that you withdrew. Saying that Britain wanted to protect the Ottoman territorial sovereignty is the funniest and stupidest thing I've heard today, especially since it's coming from a ""historian"".

You fought us in WW1 and you lost. If you had stayed neutral there wouldn't have been a Sevres. Blame Enver Pasha and his ambitions. It's easy to take a single event and act like it was the norm. When in reality the norm was to protect your sovereignty in the face of Russian expansion for most of history. The Ottomans decided to jump in bed with the Germans and that's that. You can ignore history all you want 

&gt; Saying that Britain wanted to protect the Ottoman territorial sovereignty is the funniest and stupidest thing I've heard today, especially since it's coming from a ""historian"".


Maybe you can do some history reading on the: 

- Crimean war 

- Russo-Turkish War

- Ottoman Egyptian war 

And maybe after that some figures like

-  Lord Palmerston

- William Ewart Gladstone

britain was protector of the failing, disorderly Ottoman Empire.

1406,"&gt;All that fuss because he said that Germans are the ""only people in the world who planted a memorial of shame in the heart of their capital.""
&gt;
&gt;It's **fucking absurd** to claim this to be a an anti-semitic comment. 

The entire speech is anti semitic. He is dismissing what happened to the Jewish people and saying so what, who cares about it.

&gt;&gt;They are ultra nationalist, xenophobic, homophobic, anti semitic, admire the Nazi party and Hitler, and are holocaust deniers. 
&gt;
&gt;Not only has nationalism stopped meaning what what it meant in the past. That is a nation being better/superior to others. So not only nationalist, but ultra nationalist. What is an ultra nationalist, and what had the AfD done to indicate that they're such? Someone who takes pride in their nation and culture? See you just throw these terms arround like it's nothing.

That is not the definition of ultranationalism. According to Bugajski it's 

&gt;ultra-nationalism resembles fascism, marked by a xenophobic disdain of other nations, support for¬†authoritarian¬†political arrangements verging on¬†totalitarianism, and a mythical emphasis on the ""organic unity"" between a charismatic leader, an organizationally amorphous movement-type party, and the nation

So no it's not just someone who takes pride in their culture. Funny really, you accuse me throwing words around without knowing their meaning yet it is actually you who does that. 

The AfD have show this in their actions. They have a xenophobic disdain for other countries. Look at the rhetoric they use towards other countries. For instance, Petry, who led the moderate wing of the party, thinks that the word v√∂lkisch should be used again, it should be brought into the mainstream. The word has distinct Nazi connotations and is defined as nationalistic and he wants it to be part of common usage again.

&gt;So not wanting unvetted violent migrants arriving in droves amongs illegal migrants that are all pretending to be refugees is xenophobic? Maybe not wanting to take in migrants all together is xenophobic as well? Why should Germany take in any at all? Under what obligation do they have to take in any migrants at all? Let me tell you something, all people are naturally xenophobic, it's called tribalism. Fucking babies are born xenophobic, they prefer people that look like them over those that do not.

No, I have never made this claim. You are making things up that I never said. You have also failed to argue against your own imaginary argument. Xenophobia is classed as a prejudice against people from other countries. That is using a preconceived notion that is not based on reason. Assuming all Syrians or Afghans are terrorists is one such example. All of them are not terrorists or rapists and neither are the majority. Assuming that they are is a preconceived notion not based on reason, so it's prejudice against people from other countries, so it's xenophobia. 

&gt;Homophobic? So what, do they promote violence against homosexuals? No, then what? Oh they're against same sex marrige? Wow how homophobic. How dare they follow the teaching of their faith. Why do homosexuals even want a marrige?  Surely they're not as stupid as those AfD guys that believe in God. And if they're stupid(/r/europe tells me anyone that believes in god is stupid) believe in God and are Christians then they should know that they're not applicable for marrige. (Side not, I doubt you're at all opposed to actual homophobes and anti-semites arriving in millions to Germany. You know those very one that actually prosecute both groups with violence)

They believe that gay people should not be allowed to have the same rights as heterosexual people. That means that that are discriminating against gay people. That's homophobia. 

And you appear to imply that this is fine because they are simply following their faith. Do you therefore allow Muslims to kill non believers because it's part of their faith? I actually think there should be tighter immigration but nice job making something up again. 

&gt;What anti-semetic organizations? What anti-semetic things did they say? I'm obviously not just going to take your word for it as your idea of what is anti-semitic is downright retarded.
&gt;
&gt;Who in the AfD admires Hitler and denies the holocaust? Oh what a few individuals that did got fired? What?!

Their founder H√∂cke. I gave you the speech. Their other founder Gauland said that the holocaust is a 'speck of bird shit in German history. That it doesn't really matter. He's also been accused by historians of echoing Hitler. 

Members of the party, who have not been removed, even disrupted a holocaust your and tried to deny gas chambers and the atrocities committed even happened.

Steinke called the man who tried to kill Hitler a traitor and said that Germany were forced to invade Poland. His Nazi views were known long before this came out.

&gt;If AfD is a neo-nazi group then it appears so am I. So I might as well start prasing hitler while I'm at it right? 

At least you're self aware

&gt;
&gt;This bring me back to the point you absolutely overlooked.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Furthermore, what has the party done that's indicative of neo-nazism?  What have they run on and proposed thats indicative of neo-nazism? People are too quick to slander. Sure, the only right-wing party in Germany will attract neo-nazis, and other radicals that don't align with the views of the nazis but are still labeled as such, but that is not representative of the entire party.

I've given you examples. They are not the only right wing party in Germany. CDU, CSU, FDP, the blue part and OKP are all right wing. 

I've given you examples of the leaders echoing Hitler and saying that the holocaust wasn't really a big deal. The leaders and founders have said this. The leaders and founders have shown they are neo Nazis, so it stands to reason that the party that they lead and that they founded is based on their views.

&gt;Is it bad to want you to see actual neo-nazis so you can stop throwing the term arround so carelessly?

I'm applying the term accurately. It is bad that you ignore actual neo Nazis, but you yourself have admitted that you share their views.

&gt;One more thing. Is Israel a neo-nazi country in your oppinion? They have some of the most xenophobic, homophobic, and nationalistic citizens and government found anywhere. And if you count muslims as semites, which they are. They're also anti-semitic.

Muslims aren't Semites. Some Semites can be Muslims, but not all Muslims can be Semites. If they are then you are saying that Islam is not just a religion but a race as well. In which case you can be racist towards Muslims so we can add to the AfD list. 

Israel also isn't homophobic. They allow gay people to adopt and they don't allow discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. 

They are nationalistic though but they do not support the Nazi party, revere Hitler or Nazi symbolism and they do not they the holocaust.

&gt;100% doubt you will have read all of even half of this before you reply with some other stupid shit. 

It's odd that would call a logical dissemination of your comment stupid shit. I look forward to your incompetent attempt to dismiss my claims. It's fun to see just how inept you are and just how desperately you are trying to defend a neo Nazi party. But then again you did admit you support their views so if makes sense that you would defend it

1506,"\&gt; I see your point, but you have to realize that there is a distinction between the Ottomans and Turkey.

Not really it's the successor state. But this is strange coming from you as you insinuated  in your other comment and this one that Greece is a basically a successor state to the Byzantines which is why you use language like ""take back""

\&gt;  no empire built upon the lands of so many different ethnic groups can survive for long.

Russia has, so has China, And Turks/Muslims made up a large percent of the Balkan territories, it wasn't a colonial style empire like the British Empire. The Balkans definitely can qualify as a Turkish ""homeland"" in fact there were more Turkish urban centres in that region than in anatolia, Where was Ataturk himself born again?

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  Turks made up like 10% of the population of the Ottoman Empire.

&amp;#x200B;

even ignoring other Muslim populations I don't think that's right

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  Despite the help of so many countries, including great military powers like Britain, Greece was unable to take back much of the lands they considered to be their historical homeland, like Istanbul and Izmir.

&amp;#x200B;

It took back quite a lot for a very new small country and entity. Also Greece wasn't the only country that had help. British policy towards the Ottomans was based on actually protecting it's territorial sovereignty as it provided a good buffer to Russia which is why we supported you during Ottoman Egyptian wars, The Russo-Turkish war or the Crimean war and even went against Greece's interest several times like in 1897 in places like Crete.  So we actually did a lot to prevent the Ottomans losing even more land. So you're welcome, the Greeks and others probably would have grabbed more if not for Great Britain. Actually we even did that during the war of independence in Greece After the Egyptians left the Greeks were pushing north and we called a cease fire to stop them from taking even more lands from you. So it's not a miracle that the Ottoman Empire survived as you describe it, it was actually just western help. Otherwise it would have collapsed far sooner and it would have been far worse off for Turkey. But countries (mostly) Britain pulled you out from under the water far more than once.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  I will admit that many Turks are still bitter about not being able to keep most of the islands though. But I suppose Northern Cyprus makes up for that haha

&amp;#x200B;

Turks owned all of Cyprus at one point. And I wouldn't say that. The Aegean islands are far more numerous and important than the north of Cyprus. The Greeks basically had Cyprus x 10 in 1912.

1507,"I'm not interested in an anglophone EU in 200 years.

As for French influence, you should worry about German influence instead, because it is that country that the current EU setup favours (for geopolitical and treaty reasons), which is problematic for the stability of the union.

My understanding is that France acts to keep a necessary balance. France has approached Italy but the project is frozen at the moment, and last year it felt like there was discussions with Sanchez, but nothing seems to have come out of it. What would you say if instead of Germany+France, it had been Spain+France ? What if it was enlarged to the founding members + Spain + Portugal ? That's one way to fix the current German-favouring imbalance.

Only Germany seems interested in such a closer union with France right now, so that's the news you get. And it's quite possible the project might be stalled by Germany and remain symbolic, so I wish you'd get on board yourself. I mean Spain.

1536,"I agree that the Soviet doctrine ""everything is done, we don't talk about anymore"" from the 50s wasn't really helpful. Still even during the cold war western Germany always put in great efforts make the Polish (west)German relations better. I get that NS2 is against Polands strategic interests, but the whole thing gets artificially blown up by Poland. It's not we endanger their energy security, if at all we endanger our own and not even that. It's just a fact that Russia needs our money as much we their resources and it will stay like this in the predictable future. For the security aspect we just were not in the position to help them. Our military was in the middle of a transition period in the wrong direction and there was not much we could do beside equippe them. They got quite a few tanks and airplanes for 1‚Ç¨ per piece after all, while the rest of the countries had to pay for the material. I know that our relationship to Russia is often viewed with suspicion in eastern Europe, but even during the biggest diplomatic crisis during the cold war they were always a reliable business partner for us. That they think we pay war reperations by doing business with them is exactly what I mean that some just live in a fantasy what if world. 

The change in polish policy was not just that they didn't act friendly anymore. They fueled an anti German sentiment to thrive on that in future elections and dismantle not only German efforts to make all our life better.

I mean what does Poland expect us to do forreingn policy wise? That we fuck up our business relationship with Russia because they are paranoid? At least I expect them to be reasonable. I mean we had our problems with Czechia too when it came to the refugees for example and your government was at least reasonable and you could talk to them. 

&gt;The same goes even more strongly for German approach to smaller CEE countries, like Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary and others. German foreign policy elites just don't give a fuck until something goes really wrong from the German point of view. But why would you expect that Poland and other CEE countries play the ball back when it's your businesses that show more interest in this region than your government?

*56% of goods and services go to the EU.*

Absolutely not. Also, the UK already has control on trade and law. *That's what the veto right is for.* And again, no trade deal is going to change the fact that any export to the EU will *still have to comply with EU standards*, except the UK now would have no control over what those standards are.

why would government do that if its goal is to eliminate homelessness? Remaining social workers should be government employees.

&gt; They wouldn't want these homeless people people to integrate back into society sure, but if they get money from the government to take care of them they would be happy to do it right?

*Coalition of 5 Star Movement and the League has won more fans by flouting establishment and sticking to campaign promises*

Giovanni Callea didn‚Äôt vote for the antiestablishment parties who have won power in Italy, but he would certainly do so now. A meeting of the nativist League party with local residents in his native Palermo won him over.

Ordinary people, used to an aloof political elite, got to stand up and speak, question, and even harshly criticize the new government. The League lawmakers present took every question seriously, recalled Mr. Callea, a 48-year-old marketing consultant.

‚ÄúI witnessed a lesson in politics and style,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt really seems they can respond to Italy‚Äôs need for a change.‚Äù

The new government in Rome is rattling Italy‚Äôs establishment, from industry to academia to mainstream media, as well as financial markets and European Union authorities. The unlikely coalition of the anti-immigration League and the 5 Star Movement, a party born out of grass-roots anger at old political elites, is pushing ahead with its plans to spend more on welfare and pensions while cutting taxes, even though the budget breaks EU rules on fiscal discipline and has spooked investors in Italian bonds.

But ordinary Italians see the five-month-old government as a breath of fresh air. Around 60% of Italians tell pollsters they would vote for the League or the 5 Star Movement, up from around 50% in Italy‚Äôs elections in March. Voters say they like that League leader Matteo Salvini and 5 Star head Luigi Di Maio, the government‚Äôs most powerful duo, are sticking to their costly election promises despite the brickbats from business leaders, influential pundits and bedrock institutions such as Italy‚Äôs central bank.

Indeed, many Italians view the chorus of critics as a discredited establishment whose recipes, including mandatory spending restraints, were tried and failed.

‚ÄúIn Italy, people are simply sick and tired of the elites,‚Äù said Lorenzo Pregliasco, managing partner of Turin-based political consultancy Quorum.
An open-air market in Palermo. The League was once hated south of Rome, but the party now has 20% popular support in Italy‚Äôs deep south.

The League and 5 Star show every sign of relishing the criticism. When the European Central Bank or the International Monetary Fund release dry assessments of fiscal risks, Mr. Salvini and his peers gleefully take to social media and lambaste them in colorful terms.

‚ÄúBrussels does nothing but send us little letters‚Ä¶No letter, small or big, will make us change course,‚Äù Mr. Salvini said in a video post on Facebook in early November. ‚ÄúItaly will never again be a servant and on its knees!‚Äù

The sight of EU and Italian bureaucrats clutching their pearls in response has delighted their supporters, many of whom share a deep anger after years of economic pain, uncontrolled immigration, widespread corruption and other failures of orthodox politics.

‚ÄúWe got to a point where we either fight to regain our dignity as a people that for too long has been Europe‚Äôs doormat, or we will always be losers and slaves of an oligarchy of technocrats, financial speculators and ratings firms,‚Äù said League supporter Cinzia Costantini, 46, owner of a travel agency in the Adriatic seaside resort Falconara Marittima.

However, the two governing parties are faring unequally. The League has doubled its support. But support for the 5 Star, overshadowed by the hyperactive Mr. Salvini, has slipped slightly.

Patrizia Pugliese, a 55-year-old primary schoolteacher, didn‚Äôt vote for the League in March, but she is one of millions of Mr. Salvini‚Äôs new fans. ‚ÄúI like that he is so determined and that he is putting an end to Italy‚Äôs subjection to the European Union. I want someone who takes action genuinely in favor of Italians,‚Äù she said.

Some Italians wish their government would use softer tones. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like our leaders not to speak about their critics as if they were enemies,‚Äù said Raffaella Rosin, a 57-year-old bank manager from near Turin who voted for the 5 Star.

While the pugnacious style of the two leaders has won them the support of an increasing number of voters, it has further alienated the rest of them, who find certain language, at the very least, inappropriate and more often outrageous and even xenophobic.

The League was once a north Italian movement that denounced the country‚Äôs poorer south as a burden, earning it hatred south of Rome. But Mr. Salvini has redirected the League‚Äôs ire against Brussels and Berlin, instead of Naples and Rome. The party now has 20% popular support even in Italy‚Äôs deep south. In traditional strongholds such as Italy‚Äôs wealthy northeast, meanwhile, it now has nearly 50% support.

The coalition with the 5 Star Movement, whose voters are more likely to be poor, young or southern Italian, has been fractious since day one. Messrs. Salvini and Di Maio bicker over their parties‚Äô differing policy priorities almost daily. But so far, voters have been forgiving, seeing the tense coalition as the only way for their party to deliver its election promises.

Sergio Bortolotti, a 5 Star Movement supporter, says forming a coalition with the League was ‚Äòthe lesser evil' compared with allying with other parties.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like Salvini and I don‚Äôt like the League. But the 5 Star had to find an ally to be in government,‚Äù said Sergio Bortolotti, a 35-year-old post office employee who voted for the 5 Star. ‚ÄúAt least, the League is the lesser evil,‚Äù compared with any coalition with establishment parties, he said.

‚ÄúWe were used to coalitions that didn‚Äôt do much‚Äù because the different parties always blocked each other, said Mirco Visponetti, 58, a Milan-based estate agent and League voter. This government, he says, is taking action. ‚ÄúI find what we are seeing now fascinating.‚Äù",,/r/europe/comments/9y7c2r/italys_new_masters_rattle_eu_but_ordinary/e9yzus9/,seamath2,1542558951

 When I asked people who could vote which side they leaned towards, many of them said they would vote leave. I asked them why and their response, almost uniformly, was ""because this country is going to shit."" Hitting them with well researched points for remaining didn't matter, because they weren't listening. They just voted in the direction their parents did. A few of them asked me why I was taking the matter so seriously, they didn't understand the implications, they were willfully ignorant. 


One look at the leave campaign's bullshit should have been enough to realise that they weren't running their campaign honestly, but that didn't matter, because apparently a fucktonne of our people are cunts who can't seem to do ten seconds of research by themselves. 


The remain campaign was awfully handled, and many young people were not motivated to vote, but if you look at the voting figures from the snap election, you'll see that many more young people voted.

One example we already have in the EU is electrical goods. Under EU law electrical goods powered by the mains must have a moulded plug on the end. The UK has a different plug to say France. To sell a UK manufactured electrical device in France then that production run of that product must have a French layout mains plug fitted.

2071,"I love that tone of a guy who came here to educate everyone and feels so highly about himself he's justified to ignore any arguments not fitting his view. Think about how humanity benefited from technologies invented in the World Wars or due to the Cold War later, doesn't mean anyone thinks it was a good thing to have them in overall. History is not black and white. As bad as Africa was exploited by colonialism, it still had some benefits in terms of development. While some parts of the continent were indeed more developed than many people realize, and they definitiely had some achievements before colonialism, big parts of Africa were hundreds of years (if not more) behind Europe.

If you removed European influence, you think sub-saharan Africa would look much better now? Part of it probably would, but for many of their problems they can blame no one but themselves, and some are simply caused by geography and climate. Primitive tribes exist to this day in some parts of the continent, you think Europeans created them? Female genital mutilation is practiced in 27 African countries, you think Europeans brought that? Droughts and famine? Native diseases? Endless conflicts? Some people actually attribute that to colonialism. And this is maybe true to some extent, but it's naive to think they wouldn't fight among themselves and kill each other without colonialism, this is a popular myth about ""peaceful american natives"" too. They fought countless pointless wars just like people in Europe, Americas and Asia did. The only guarantee of general peace in Europe came with nuclear weapons. Europeans might have fueled some of these local conflicts and created some of them, but they didn't bring the concept of war to some mythical idyllic Africa. Even if we talk about such things as slavery, in most cases it was Africans themselves that enslaved other Africans and sold them to Europeans. It was the same with native civilizations in America. Early European colonists simply had no means to dominate the continents by themselves, they allied with some native populations against others.

Many efforts to help the poorest African countries today are wasted by Africans themselves. Even see what happens in South African Republic after they got rid of the evil white people ruling them. Is it a better country now?

Check out a documentary set in Congo, Empire of Dust, that shows some of their problems there.

To sum it up, it's not that I or any other user I saw here ""supports colonialism"", it's just not as simple matter of being ""good"" or ""bad"" as you want it to be.

Do you want to talk about cheap labor? Try looking into western European low-wage sectors and realize a lot of them are dominated by eastern Europeans, **the original cheap labor**.

Because that was the original decline of ""western Europe"" as a high-wage zone: The fall of the Iron Curtain leading to an influx of cheap labor due to eastern Europeans migrating West.

But this goes both ways: While we in the West might have given up on our ""super high wages"" and ""super high wage increases"", this paid out in the form of lifting our eastern European neighbors up from where they originally were because a lot of the money they earn in the West, they send straight back to their families in the East.

And now here we are, with you even complaining about *that* like it's a bad thing. What's your solution?

Well its been a busy one to say the least,

Theresa May released the draft brexit deal, didn't go down to well with really anyone. You can read the highlights here [\[1\]](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/15/uk/brexit-deal-key-policy-takeaways-intl-gbr/index.html) or if you want you can read the full text here [\[2\]](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/draft_withdrawal_agreement_0.pdf). This has resulted in some chaos, summary of which is:

* Numerous ministers resigning [\[3\]](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46219495), most notably Esther Mcvey the former works and pension secretary and Dominic Raab who was David Davis replacement as Brexit Secretary.
* The Pro-Brexit conservative MPs are trying to launch a no confidence vote which would result in Theresa May having to run in a leadership election within the convervative party. Currently unknown if the 48 required no confidence votes have been recieved.
* Labour are gearing up for a potential snap election, even with their recent anti-semitism and general tomfoolery they look like they have a decent chance of getting into power with SNP support if an election were to happen.
* There is a cross party alliance forming that now actually looks plasuable with the goal of ending Brexit. They aim to introduce a second referednum and pass it by majority in parliment [\[4\]](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/27/jeremy-corbyn-second-brexit-vote-commons-amendment)
* Theresa made a speech where a lot of people were expecting her to resign, instead she held firm and basically said its my deal, no deal or no brexit [\[5\]](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/11/theresa-may-warns-conservative-party-chairs-her-deal-can-t-be-renegotiated) This has been backed up by prominent EU members [\[6\]](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46228454)

Overall there is a huge sense of uncertainty, the conservatives seem to be tearing themselves apart with tabloid papers reporting that when Mcvey quit she was so distraught ministers thought security would have to be called. There's also questions with how our new benifits system Universal Credit is going to be rolled out as Mcvey was the head of the department responsible for it, she has been replaced by senior politican Nicky Morgan who, as far as anyone knows, plans to keep the rollout on track. Universal Credit is massively unpopular among those on benifits so there is likely to be more pushback in the future.

In more happy news England won their first sieries in Sri Lanka since 2001 [\[7\]](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/46251695)...and thats it, literally no more happy news for the entire country.

I'm going back to bed.

2216,"The simple answer is because they weren't Europeans so people cared less for them.

&amp;#x200B;

A more complex answer would probably say that what happened was actually mostly similar in both cases, with already existing states annexing most of Austria-Hungary such as with Romania, Italy and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Austria was forbidden to join with Germany, so it instead gained independence and Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland couldn't be kept because the allies decided not to force the country to remain a Kingdom and they all declared independence. Nobody else could take the regions because the Russians lost WW1 and the civil war against the Soviets and Germany was on the losing side so it wouldn't gain anything anyway, plus the fact that the regions were now landlocked there was no other choice but for them to become independent.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the distribution of the lands of the Ottoman Empire, a very simple answer is colonialism. The allies weren't about to let a bunch of independent states pop up in regions that would threaten their already existing colonies, especially seeing as most were of the same ethnicity.

2218,"Let's have some [Spekulatius](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spekulatius), it's halfway to December already anyways. I can't prove it, I don't have sources, but I'm writing on the internet so what I'm about to say is on the level of peer reviewed research.

I believe that a small group in the British government, most certainly aligned with the ERG, has a  [vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britannia_Unchained) for Britain. *That* is their core belief, and everything done during Brexit negotiations flows from this. If they seem to not know what they want, it is a deliberate strategy to achieve a no deal Brexit.

A hard Brexit is a splendid way of realising their vision. Yet, not even this small group believes they are simply able to demand one and get away with it. Even worse, they realise that their vision is one for the elites, and not the common man. Hence they need to convince the latter to cut off his own flesh and think it's patriotism. As such, they wish to guide the process towards a hard Brexit while pretending to work in the national interest.

The solution is to torpedo everything from the sidelines, be entirely unconstructive, and morally outraged at any deal presented to them. They are imprecise in their demands on purpose. It allows them to create a situation where they may *seem* as if they have a principled, if hardline, stance. In reality, it allows them to shift the goalposts at will such that they can refuse any realistically possible deal and authentically rile up opposition to any deal other than an impossible one. 

If successful, this reduces the possible deals to: none. Once a hard Brexit has begun and the inevitable fallout started, the ruling government will be ousted. A deteriorating security and economic situation, of course blamed on everyone but themselves, will allow for sweeping new legislation transforming Britain into a Singapore on the Thames.

**tl;dr:** In the case of government, never attribute to stupidity that which can be adequately explained by greed.

* The government will invest (more) in offensive capabilities, among others for the purpose of attribution (see previous bullet).
* The MoD is conducting a study into the design, formation and organization of a Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãInnovation Hub to be set up in 2019, in which government departments, research institutes and companies work together on joint and prioritized security issues in the field of cyber security.
* As of 2019, the Dutch MoD will invest ¬±6.5 million euros per year in cyber research. This is an increase from the 4 million euros invested in previous years.

Also shows that having a constructive conversation isn't really the goal here, not that it's surprising unfortunately. The refugee situation has been the subject of countless heated debates over the course of half a decade at least and people are still doing little more other than regurgitating the same old two ""jokes"" and/or using the usual ""SJW, racist, nazi, libtard, etc"" tiresome shtick one way or another.

2522,"I'm not ignoring that but you are ignoring the other half of my comment. Women had less legal rights, even compared to poor men. 

I also found the last part of your comment very interesting. The idea that those with more responsibility should have the larger voice as otherwise you would have the few controlling the many. I don't even know where to begin with the paradox in your logic. 

Those with the most responsibility would make up a minority of society. That is simply logical. Responsibility is not a finite resource so the group with the most responsibility will be those with the fewest members. The group with the second most responsibilities will be the group with the second fewest members and so on. 

You essentially create a hierarchy with the group with the most responsibility, and fewest members, at the top. Since those with the most responsibility should be those with the biggest voice, according to you, then the smallest group will have the largest voice. The few will be controlling the many. So the very thing you are trying to avoid by giving those with the most responsibility the largest voice, is what you end up allowing.

But let's continue examining this view of yours. Who has more responsibility, the Amazon factory worker or Jeff Bezos. Obviously it's Bezos, since he owns a large company and employs thousands of people. Those who own companies have more responsibility than the ordinary worker. So with your logic, the rich men who own companies should have a larger voice than the ordinary worker. 

This is the exact same thing that was the case over 100 years ago. Rich men who were allowed the vote because they had greater responsibility than poor men. So the few would control the many. Your logic about responsibility and the largest voice would not stop the few from controlling the many, it would actually allow it and legitimise it ",,/r/europe/comments/9xvn90/boys_left_to_fail_at_school_because_attempts_to/e9xm5rg/,LadyLikeWings,1542508639

Do you agree that the EU is the only thing that keep peace in between member states and they would be at constant war ever since without it (which is the debate)? 

&gt;But the likelihood of European states not engaging in a minor or major war in 60 years in a non-EU Europe is so low that I am perfectly willing to call such a war inevitable.

How have you determined that is so low? 

&gt;Yes. On the same correlation that says that if I saw a thousand dropped apples fall to ground I am going to assume that the no 1001 is also going to hit the ground when I drop it.

2595,"&gt;Personally I think the issue is that the Americans realized that a bigger threat lies on the other side of the world, and is shifting their attention there, while the Europeans fell asleep after the cold war was over, believing the ""End of history"" garage that became very popular in the 90s.

Describing it as falling asleep isn't entirely fair. With the Warsaw pact gone, it made no sense to stay prepared for a type of war that was now not going to come. A military doesn't become more powerful by spending more than it needs just for the sake of spending more. 

A pivot to global operations was never realistic anyway. You can't expect countries the size of Holland or Belgium or even France and the UK to maintain carrier fleets and forward bases in the Indian ocean and the pacific, military satellite networks and ground stations. The scale isn't there. Increasing defense spending to 2% or 5% or 10% of GDP isn't going to make it happen either. Even Russia can't do it anymore. Capability like that can only be achieved on a scale like the US, China, or the EU combined.

2665,"&gt; Doordat Maastricht zich tot het laatst was blijven verzetten, volgde daarop, in overeenstemming met het toenmalige krijgsrecht, een driedaagse plundering van de stad.[13] Tijdens de inname en de daarop volgende plundering lag Parma met hoge koorts op bed, waardoor de inname waarschijnlijk bloediger verliep dan gebruikelijk. Vooral de Duitsers en Walen zouden zich zeer misdragen hebben.[4] De wraak van de overwinnaars, die immers ook grote verliezen hadden geleden, richtte zich niet slechts op diegenen die hadden meegeholpen met de verdediging van de stad. Na de inname werd niets of niemand ontzien. Mannen, vrouwen, bejaarden en zelfs kinderen werden afgeslacht. De straten lagen vol met lijken. Hoewel dergelijke gruwelen in de Nederlanden geen uitzondering meer waren, lijkt de inname van Maastricht in dat opzicht uitzonderlijk gewelddadig te zijn geweest.



&gt; De inname van Maastricht volgens Jan Luyken, 1679
Later werd het aantal slachtoffers, de ernst van de gruwelen en de omvang van de plunderingen sterk overdreven, met name bij het protestantse volksdeel in de Republiek der Verenigde Nederlanden. In de 17e eeuw beweerden Bor en Van Meteren dat de bevolking op enkele honderden na werd uitgemoord en dat alle leegstaande huizen in brand waren gestoken.[14] Alleen al op de eerste dag zouden vierduizend mensen zijn omgebracht. De straten zagen rood van het bloed, hoofdeloze rompen, afgeslagen ledematen, overal lagen rottende hopen menselijke overblijfselen. Volgens sommige kroniekschrijvers richtte de bloeddorst van de overwinnaars zich met name op vrouwen, die van huis tot huis werden achtervolgd, verkracht en vermoord, en daarna van daken en uit vensters werden gesmeten. Sommige moeders sprongen met hun kinderen in de armen uit wanhoop in de Maas. Het moordtoneel was zo ijselijk dat het lang voortleefde in de verbeelding van velen. Volgens sommige bronnen overleefden minder dan vierhonderd burgers het bloedbad. Walen vestigden zich in de ontvolkte stad.

There is a telescope planned, called the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which was designed by a consortium of NASA and the Canadian and European space agencies. It is designed to directly measure light from very early stars, whose wavelength has been shifted to longer wavelengths by the expansion of the universe. JWST is the successor for the Hubble telescope and it is expected to revolutionize astronomy to the same degree that the Hubble telescope did. JWST is scheduled to launch in about 18 months.

2749,"&gt; This 'argument' you make is not an argument in a democracy.

That's literally the opposite of truth, in a democracy that's the most important argument. 

It's not limited to Muslims either, but to all religious people, like how, even though US has guaranteed freedom of (and from) religion and separation of Church and state, religion is everywhere and ""In God we trusts"" is the official motto and is on the currency as well. Opposition to gay marriage and abortions, in US and in Europe, is almost entirely based on religious grounds, in a supposedly secular republic. 

So even if a democracy is officially secular a large group of determined religious people can make perversion of that secularity through the democratic process and the politicians they elect to represent them. 

In a dictatorship or absolute monarchy it doesn't matter who your countrymen are and what they believe in, in a democracy that is of the utmost importance. Now keeping that in mind remember that Muslims are both fastest growing demographic and much younger than average and then return to that Pew poll on Muslim attitudes.",,/r/europe/comments/9xvgsl/roughly_half_of_poles_wouldnt_agree_to_a_muslim_a/e9x1b1u/,nrrp,1542494291

&gt;What a load of bollocks.

Dude, relax.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Stating the laws that apply to a product if you choose to try to sell it  in Europe, is not the same as setting the laws on the product  irrespective of where it is sold.

Not quite sure what you mean here. Products sold in the EU need to be uphold to a certain standard in their production of said products that is defined by the EU.

But since you remain in the customs union with the EU for the time being until a trade deal is made this is how it's going to be. The alternative, as it is now, is crashing out of the EU next March.

And being in the customs union means that your products can be transported and sold anywhere in the EU without any checks. To ensure everyone plays nicely there are some rules you need to follow.

Now because you are leaving the EU eventually, the EU 27 have decided to exclude you from lawmaking but you are still allowed in the customs union for the time being.

And it's not a bad deal. It essentially means you get a time extension to get a workable solution. In my view it's a pretty generous offer that you've got now, considering the mess it has been so far from the UK side.

No proper solution to get out of our destructive system.

If you know Pulawska you know those temporary lights at Baletowa, which were supposed to be gone for two years now and are contributing a lot to traffic jams? As PKP has now more than 2 years of delay building a simple viaduct on Karczunkowska street over the Radom line. So yeah, I integrated, enough to know from my friends how state funded projects go in Poland. I‚Äôve actually known that from the day I cam here as I‚Äôve been hearing of stuff opening which was supposed to open for the Euro 2012 as jokes since I came here (after said tournament). As far as I know the ring road to Pulawska was one of those projects. And it had a what, 2 or 3 year delay? So 2021 is 2024 I guess. So Polish state projects don‚Äôt really have a good track record.

Getting a ""palatable"" deal isn't the point though, is it?

I could imagine three acceptable scenarios, from the EU's point of view:

* no Brexit: this would be ideal for the EU, obviously. Doesn't hurt the economy, humiliates the Brexiteers, perfect.
* a deal like this one: the economy has time to adapt, so it doesn't hurt that much, the Brexiteers get their Brexit, but it's still humiliating for them, because the whole deal is covered with little clauses like the ones mentioned in the article.
* no deal: really hurts the economy, but the economy in the UK will suffer far more than in the EU27. The Brexiteers keep face, but will be seen as huge idiots and as the ones responsible for ruining the UK's economy.

2852,"Right. I think a lot of people are trying to tie this to a specific form of feminism, be it intersectional feminism, third-wave feminism, you name it, but I think that's too rationalist an approach here. We need to recognize the fact some feminists simply act in bad faith ('revenge'). And this happens at every level: from well-connected philosophers to somebody down the street, and it also happens in every other ideological grouping.

There's a reluctance among reasonable, liberal men to criticize feminism because they speak from a position of privilege. In some cases, it can even feel like a taboo. For instance: sexual abuse towards men. Yes, it happens significantly less *often* than abuse towards women, but that's not a reason say we shouldn't talk rationally about it. Else, as has happened, it gets co-opted by male supremacist (word?) extremists.

Of course, people get invested in fighting for justice for personal reasons. If you're a woman, you'll be more likely to actively fight for feminism than if you're a man. Better example: see the discussion about the role of the ally in LGBT+ communities. But this doesn't mean that you're allowed to hijack an ideology and turn it into ""me, me, *me*!"" Ultimately, privilege and oppression are only theoretical models, like the bourgeoisie and the proletariat (not too different actually).

We're talking about schizophrenics.

&gt;Yes. Every adult, as long as they don't decide to do something dangerous, isn't inherently dangerous.

Logically incorrect. Inherent danger is still present whether or not they decide to act. Inherent danger is due to environmental and GENETIC factors (predisposition to anger, violence, SCHIZOPHRENIA).

&gt;I have a family member with this exact condition who is a teacher. 

Oh. What a coincidence.

If that even is true, I feel pity because you are clearly biased. It would be terrible if you accepted the reality that your family member is more likely to commit a crime or be a strange influence.

Again, conflating gays with schizphrenics as if they're the same in any way.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; NATO was completely mutually beneficial. 

So you admit that it does benefit the US. I didn't conclude anything about European interests because they vary widely depending mostly on geography. It's a super long topic, my purpose here was only to address the US interest since it was raised that NATO is against American interests. If you say it is mutually beneficial, then we've reached agreement regarding the reason I engaged and I'll just clarify side topics instead of delving into each European country's specific interests.


&gt; You seem to present it as some sort of US scheme to use Western Europe as puppet states.

That would be quite an overstatement indeed. I'd say that it is soft colonialism, more like sucking and keeping countries into the empire's sphere of influence. The affected countries can benefit from this too, but they are absorbed into US interests which they can rarely ignore and even more rarely go against. That strategy is part of what made the US a world empire, and it came into being as a result of the struggle for influence against the USSR.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; I like every other American grew up with the understanding that if the U.K., France, or Germany was attacked, it meant I was going to war to defend them.

Yes. That's the narrative, don't worry Europeans have similarly positive narrative towards the US. History also validates good feelings as far as France is concerned. But let's stress the difference between a State's foreign policy and its population, and between the notion of alliance and the notion of dependence. In the case of France, you have an ally that has always tried to keep as much independence as it could given a geopolitical context of very dependent neighbours. Have your own voice, be your own force, have your own liberty of action, because regardless of who they are the party you depend on cannot be entirely free of interests that undermine yours -- especially when their geopolitical context differs.

When it comes state policy, all states are playing a permanent game of chess for influence.    
You're probably not aware how many times the US have tried to foil French plans aimed at securing their own independence and inciting other Western European countries to build an independent Europe. [I'm sure modern France has foiled similar plans in Africa, passing judgement is not my intent.]    
On the other hand Germany, about which you're growing wary, is possibly the most US-aligned of the big continental countries of Western Europe. If they had the same spirit as the French, the European union and NATO would likely be completely different. But Merkel is also frustratingly good at pursuing German interests (as perceived from her own partisan view, as always), she's been playing directly against fellow EU countries interests from time to time and moved her pieces forward within the union. The US arguably came even before EU countries, at least until Trump, because Germany is dependent and aligned and therefore forced to account for the US when making a move.

But that's only State policy. Regarding populations I can't say. It's obvious that there are ties between Americans and, each for their own historic and cultural reasons, the British, the Irish, the French or the Spanish. I'm not too familiar with German ties, but a lot of German immigration occurred in the past which tends to say that the US held a special spot in German minds ?

&amp;nbsp;

Either way, regardless of what the German population think, as soon as the US lightens its influence over Europe, say because it has to divert significant military resources to Asia, Europe will mechanically grow more independent. That's why your strategists advise against this. The Western bloc as a whole will lose influence worldwide as a result, but European influence will grow, and we'll be left with a multipolar world. As I said in my previous comment it is not particularly safer, but it's the likely path.

The ones we have here, well, we didn't exactly welcome, they were planted here by an occupation regime. The one that killed and deported many natives and installed an oppressive regime that made Estonia and Latvia completely miss the post-WWII baby boom other European countries had, so as a result, causing hundreds of thousands of Estonians and Latvians to not have been born. To compensate that, it started planting its own countrymen, which totalled over a million during its reign, even briefly making natives a minority in their own capital. It was basically a slower version of ethnic cleansing a'la Hitler. All done by the regime that called itself liberator and what its successor state still likes to do.

I knew a woman that was a fanatical communist (we called iron-forged commie). She traveled to USSR all the time, and wore black and cried during the Brezhnev funeral. She welcomed Soviet troops in 1968, and was on a panel after post Dubcek and purging people from the institutions and factories for not supporting a new regime. She was snitching on people who were happy with his death. In 1989, she was a member of the local for-democracy forum, shouting for a free election, etc. Her son, who beat up anyone who said something bad about communism, Soviets, and Russians, became a member of right-wing pro-business party of ODS.

&gt; Because white men are just more qualified. Definitely not because of some preferential treatment, because that's just silly talk

You do realise that there's a multitude of factors that may influence demographics of a certain industry?

3045,"Triglav likely has nothing to do with the god Triglav. Sure, it could actually be named after the god, but there wouldn't be any proof of that, as the more obvious reason for the name are the mountain's three distinctive peaks. You are right, though, I forgot about the name Vesna, it is somewhat common here, yes.

Perun is probably the most commonly known Slavic god and even then the only knowledge left of them is in the form of place names. That is almost nothing. People know of a general role, which is again gained by comparing them to similar deities like Thor, a name and that's about it.

Most modern pagan religions are almost complete fabrications, this is not only restricted to the Slavic religions. If it weren't for the high chance of a lot of things there on there being fake, I would simply say to look at the list of Celtic deities on Wikipedia, where a single region gets a larger list of gods than the entire Slavic pantheon, most of which come with a larger description as well. As for the Greeks and Romans, well they've had so many centuries of literature that it would be next to impossible to not know their pantheons in such detail.

My point is simply that the amount of the mythology preserved for the Slavic pantheons is so little it is pretty much pointless to say that anything has been preserved at all, as other than a list of names and speculation on the origin of a few traditions, people know next to nothing about them. This goes for almost every pagan religion. I wouldn't consider a list of names to count as well known.

Edit: Basically I think my opinion is somewhat different then yours. I would consider the little amount currently preserved to not even be enough to be a religion, but given by the amount of neo-pagans that exist, my opinion is clearly not universal. I suppose in the end I'm not religious anyway, so people can be whatever they want, be that Christian, pagan, etc, but I personally wouldn't consider anything with so little preserved to be legitimate.",Slovenia,/r/europe/comments/9wqlln/what_do_you_know_about_the_ottoman_empire/e9w523t/,helppleaseIasknicely,1542472529

OP has already addressed the congestion, but I want to add something to it; the road is only open from May until November (usually, the season can be shortened by snow on both ends), and Kjerag is massively popular as a BASE jumping spot.

It will never be congested as such, but you will meet other cars and the road is very narrow - many places two cars can't even pass each other so you have to use meeting spots made for that purpose.

3097,"&gt; too many ""white, pale, stale males"" in the business.

Do people still not get this kind of talk is not a good way to go about this. Imagine someone saying there are too many ""black, dark, stale women"" in the business. Acceptable? No. So don't use it this way also.

&gt; JWT's gender pay gap was 44.7%, The Times said.

I am going to assume that a woman doing the same job as a man at this company is not earning 44.7% less. This is an effect of more men in higher paying positions. That is something you could try to fix, by arranging your hiring process in such a way that it attracts more qualified women for the jobs. But using the percentages this way is totally misleading.

&gt;""If I may point out, you still account for at least 80% of senior creative roles. Even after a concerted effort in recent years, women still only represent 13% of creative directors and still, in 2017, only 8% of senior positions are held by someone who's black or from a minority ethnicity. Statistics, history and the resulting bias in society demonstrates that you are in fact unfairly advantaged""

This is not the fault of the individual you are addressing. You are in charge now, so use your position to encourage more women and minorities to get into those senior positions, or spent money to give courses to get people qualified for those promotions. But do not present it as if the one now in the senior position has done something wrong. Attacking people like this has never worked and will only backfire.

&gt;""if the group of creatives can prove that they were discriminated against, there is no limit to the damages they could receive. Some believe that this could cost the agency millions,"" he wrote.

3107,"I followed a program designed by them for middle and high school, without professoral interference, so it was 100% the content they wanted to teach young people. 

The program glorified  pacifists in France who sabotaged munitions during world war 1, causing them to explode in French soldier‚Äôs faces. For WW2 it slammed collaborators, with no statement regarding the pressure these people were under. There was no objectivity, only evil vs good. They made no mention of the thousands of French soldiers who fought in the war, coming from the North African territories, only of the r√©sistants who were and still are in France considered the only heroes of the war along with De Gaulle, when in fact the rest of non-continental France kept fighting. They glossed over what was done to women who had slept with German soldiers after the war was won, saying it was justified. The program also justified the massacres in Algeria perpetuated against French ‚Äúcolonists‚Äù (never mind that they‚Äôd been there for more than 100 years) and completely failed to give an objective view of the events of the Algerian war. 

This is just history, geography was similarly ‚Äúslanted‚Äù towards one political viewpoint, as was civic education and any other subject that wasn‚Äôt hard science.

No matter how many dozens of millions died at the hands of communist regimes, no matter how many atrocities occurred under communist regimes, no matter how many millions were starved to death, raped, tortured, humiliated, no matter how many villages NKVD burned and how many people they have executed, communists will keep repeating the same old mantra - ""this is not the feature of communism"" and ""this is not real communism"", and they will never admit the obvious, that there's actually something inherently wrong with their ideology. 

Many countries and ideologies fail, but only communism seems to enjoys wide support torturing us mentally and physically over and over again. At this point it's hard to know what proponents of communism endorse more, the vague philosophical message, or the very real opportunity to commit unpunished atrocities.

3118,"&gt;This is the first time I‚Äôm talking to a ‚ÄòLeaver‚Äô why did you vote leave and what do you think the future will look like in the UK? 

I voted leave for number of reasons namely the direction and the pace of the Union as well as immigration. I don't want to the UK to become and state inside a USE, you might say that most people in the EU don't want that either but it's quite clear that most of the EU establishment (Tusk, Verhofstadt etc) does and are pushing for it quite hard.

All it takes is one PM who is ideological believer in the EU like Tony Blair was for example and we could be tied to the Euro, part of EU army etc. Then we are Inextricably linked to the EU and it would be even harder to leave than it is now, basically I saw this as our only chance to leave before we where bonded tighter.

There is also the low skilled immigration I have no problem with the people personally who come here seeking a better life, but while they do have a net benefit to the economy they undoubtedly affect the poorest in our country negatively from increased competition to work, social housing, schools, healthcare etc. Not to mention stagnating wages, lowering standards and decrease in job security because they simply don't know better.

As for the future I think it might be a bumpy few years until its all sorted out. I don't think it will be the financial Armageddon people seem to be hoping for on here and a slowdown of growth is hardly the end of the world. I do generally believe we will be much better off in the medium to long-term though and not just economically.

You are very wrong on that account, as it was Lithuania who literally denied possibility of any talks with Poland. So the only difference is

Preventing crises and balancing out economic differences: This is to be ensured by a common budget for the Euro states. Germany and France have now agreed on a plan.

By Christian Feld and Moritz R√∂dle, ARD Capital Studio

The document consists of only two pages. But it is an important step towards a possible common budget for the Euro zone countries. The text, which is available to the ARD capital studio, describes how Germany and France envisage a Euro zone budget.

In principle, the two governments had agreed on such a project in June in Meseberg, Brandenburg. After long negotiations, agreement has been reached on a concrete plan, which will now be presented to the other finance ministers. The Euro zone budget is to reduce the economic differences between the 19 Euro states and better prevent crises.

Access to the new budget will only be granted to Euro zone members. The justification for this separate instrument was that there was a need for ""a higher degree of cohesion and competitiveness in order to ensure the stability of the Euro zone as a whole"". For example, members of the association cannot devalue their currencies on their own.

The new budget should respond to the specific needs of the Euro area and support ""significant investment and reform"". It is intended to co-finance particularly growth-enhancing public spending, for example on investment, research or innovation. Countries must abide by EU rules

The Euro zone budget is to be part of the EU budget - a point that is important for the German side. This should ensure that the budget is in line with the general EU budget rules. For the new budget, the members of the Euro zone would conclude an intergovernmental treaty.

It would also regulate how much each country would have to contribute. According to the paper, a ""maximum amount"" would also be set. Only those who comply with EU rules - including fiscal rules - will receive money. This could, for example, block Italy's access.

A concrete figure is missing

The Franco-German proposal does not yet mention any concrete information on a total amount for the Euro zone budget. This must be the result of further negotiations. In the summer, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire described an amount of 20 to 25 billion Euros as a ""good starting point"". That is far from what President Emmanuel Macron originally demanded. In his speech at the Sorbonne University in Paris in September 2017, Macron presented his proposals for the ""new foundation of a sovereign, united and democratic Europe"".

On Sunday, the French President will visit Berlin - officially to commemorate the Memorial Day and to commemorate the dead of the First World War, which ended 100 years ago. But the talks in the Chancellor's Office are likely to focus above all on proposals for EU reforms such as the Euro zone budget.

For some people who call themselves feminist, since everyone can say they are of course. I am not denying those exist. But it is not reflective of everyone who supports feminism, and the definition of it and the way it is thought definitely also includes men. Of course historically, the first groups mostly addressed the lacking rights of women in those days, since those were pretty big issues to be fixed (voting rights, divorce, ability to make their own choices even, abortion, that kind of stuff).

3275,"&gt; privatize everything .. if you were to create a structure for capital markets like it exist in the US

if you did this you would be completely fucked. the US is the last place anyone should be looking toward emulating.

the notion that 'privatizing' solves problems is classic brainwashing by the oligarchy who owns the western world. privatization hands over any benefits generated (monetary or social) into the hands of a few. these owners live in a country called Richestan .. their profits safely distributed in tax havens around the world .. and are not put back into public services of your country.

also, it is worth noting that the only reason the US is 'rich' is bc its oversized military power ensures they can maintain the USD as the gold standard around the world. this allows them to print money at any time and swap these greenback IOUs for overseas goods without ever having to worry about austerity.

There have been numerous scandals about this, and this is only about the stuff that actually gets snuffed out that subsequently gets swept under the rug as fast as possible.

It's also nice that Paradox/Colossal Order gives out copies of DLC's in advance to modders with many mods, so they can update them before release. 

It's also the reason I still play this game since release (in 2015). If it wasn't for the mods and assets, i'd be done with game within half a year I guess.

3552,"I think we're having a disagreement over terminology. To me the security of a state means the physical security of its soil. There are/were 2 things that threatened that since the start of the cold war. Nuclear weapons and Cuba (which is why the US almost started a nuclear war in an attempt to contain them).

Everything else the Americans call ""National security"" is (to me) just power projection. The fight in Europe was never about security for Americans. Europe could turn red, and American security situation would barely change. The US security cannot be threatened as long as Canada, Mexico and the few islands around their mainland remain under their control.

It's true that back in the day European armies were actually much stronger, but they never had the ability to defend the US. They were armies meant to fight in Europe, not in the Americas. Post-WW2 most military expeditions led by European states, without the US almost without exception let to failure (until the US bailed them out - usually ) - Suez, Vietnam, Indonesia, Libya, ...

&gt;I think the issue is that it is no longer obvious that the next big conflict is likely to take place on European soil, and even if they can mobilize millions of soldiers, there are 27 little navies and air forces to work with.

Personally I think the issue is that the Americans realized that a bigger threat lies on the other side of the world, and is shifting their attention there, while the Europeans fell asleep after the cold war was over, believing the ""End of history"" garage that became very popular in the 90s.

&gt;The prince took steps in negotiating anti-Ottoman alliances first with the Habsburg Monarchy, and then with Peter the Great's Russia (see Russo-Turkish War, 1710-1711): upon the 1710 Russian intervention in Moldavia, the prince contacted Tsar Peter and accepted gifts from the latter, while his rivalry with the Moldavian Prince Dimitrie Cantemir (the main regional ally of the Russians) prevented a more decisive political move. Instead, Br√¢ncoveanu gathered Wallachian troops in Urla»õi, near the Moldavian border, awaiting for Russian troops to storm into his country and offer his services to the tsar, while also readying to join the Ottoman counter-offensive in the event of a change in fortunes. When several of his boyars fled to the Russian camp, the prince saw himself forced to decide in favor of the Ottomans or risk becoming an enemy of his Ottoman suzerain, and swiftly returned the gifts he had received from the Russians.

&gt;Such policies were eventually denounced to the Porte. Br√¢ncoveanu was deposed from his throne by Sultan Ahmed III, and brought under arrest to Constantinople, where he was imprisoned in 1714 at the fortress of Yedikule (the Seven Towers).



this is why he was executed. A lot of viziers, Turkish or not, were also executed by Ottomans. This guy literally supported Russians against Ottomans.

3634,"&gt; The Pledged Warming Map provides an assessment of global warming when all countries follow the ambition of a given one. This warming assessment assumes a self-interested approach of equity where each country follows the least stringent of three equity concepts (historical responsibility, capacity to pay and equality). This warming assessment reconciles the bottom-up architecture of the Paris Agreement with its top-down warming threshold.

3647,"Google translation:

Cartagena wanted to be a state of the United States in 1873, Texas could be sold to Great Britain and there is a movement in Puerto Rico that promotes the return to Spain ... These are some of the most crazed territorial annexation attempts in history

Geopolitics is like a roadside motel with strange guests coming and going. Of sporadic stays and dark past that is hidden by shame or forgetfulness. The peaceful annexations of territories are not very common and in the world there are some very curious, prey of interests or crazy visions. So much so that one day Madrid was the capital of Armenia. Not only that, it was before Spain.

In 1375 the king of Armenia [Leo V of the House of Lusignan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_V,_King_of_Armenia) fell prisoner of the Mamluks. He was held captive in Cairo for several years. His case was very media at the time because he refused to abjure Christianity, which made him a symbol of faith. King Juan I of Castile intervened in his liberation and not only that, he gave him the lordship of Madrid, And√∫jar and Villarreal with 150,000 maraved√≠es of pension.

The historian Carlos Fisas (1919-2010) tells in one of his famous anecdotal books that Le√≥n V moved his court to Madrid, which at that time was to be just a small town. He promised the people of Madrid to keep their privileges, but soon forgot their commitments generating great discomfort among his subjects. Before the complaints, the king of Castile promised that these people would return to their domain to the death of Leo V . However, his successor Henry III did not want to wait that long and revoked the donation two years before the death of the Armenian, who had left his mini kingdom on the way to France.

In the protocol of the geostrategy, as in the one of the courtesy, to enter before it is necessary to leave to leave. In the era of the Brexit and the proc√©s , there are some movements much more unknown and that due to their scant support they are quite pilgrims. We talk about the 'exit' Americans.For example, there are the 'Texit' in Texas, a state that has been part of the history of Mexico and the United States and that between father and mother has wanted several times to become independent. What is barely known is that a lawyer named Stephen Pearl Andrews tried to sell Texas to Britain.

It was a plan to abolish slavery in this territory playing the trick of foreign intervention (in England the Law of Abolition is 1833). The Texans were not very for the work, they even ended up being part of the Confederate States of America that would lose the Civil War (1861-1865) that put an end to the slavery in the USA.

At the national level, and a few years after what happened in Texas, another very particular case occurred. During the rebellion of the canton of Cartagena against the government of the First Republic, Roque Barcia, a prominent leader of the uprising, sent a letter on December 16, 1873 to the president of the United States, Ulysses S. Grant (the victor general of the North Civil War), through his ambassador in Madrid, Daniel E. Sickles. The letter requested the raising of the American flag to stop the bombing of the city by government forces. His final intention was to adhere to the United States as a full-fledged state. A project that, if consummated, would have led the city of Murcia today to be a star of the United States flag. The White House never answered.

While some wanted to leave, others are nostalgic. In Puerto Rico there is a party that increasingly has more followers. This is the Movement for Reunification with Spain , a very curious phenomenon if we bear in mind that in Puerto Rican politics there used to be only pro-independence parties favorable to becoming a fully-fledged State of the United States. Their claims are based on the alleged indifference of the Americans. First during the 2008 crisis and, above all, for the poor response of the US government after Hurricane Maria , which further damaged the economy of this commonwealth

""We want to recover the political equality that we lost in 1898 [year when it ceased to be a Spanish colony after the war with the US] We are second class citizens, we do not vote for the president, we do not have senators or representatives in Washington,"" claimed Jos√© a few months ago Nieves Seise, leader of the movement.

3801,"I went in quite bit of a detail so I'd appreciate if you read it all.

Heavily depends on which country.

But it works here, it's because of the magnitude and frequency.We don't protest much. But when we do the protest is an ""oh shit"" kind of thing and is never about a small issue... So it's going to be far more impactful. 

In the States it just seems like protesting is some people's favorite past-time - nevermind the fact that it gets pretty violent over there and is many times protesting against certain groups or individuals instead of the government. 

And it's a lot of time a certain well organized groups or political party affiliates (internet helps here) that doesn't represent a significant portion of the population/voters. 


Say, vegans*. They are like less than 5% of the population and even smaller fraction of the population that votes, but they can pull a pretty large protest. Should the government listen in this case and risk the votes of the 95%? Obviously not, and it's also advisable they don't from a democratic pov (tyranny of the minority). So with the other protests that's always going to be the question ""Is this actually a diverse representation of a huge portion of the population or is this just a niche political/interested group?""

And honestly with all that in mind, I think protests in the US have a really large impact, it's no longer the way it was, when there was no internet and protest was a big deal that took a lot of planning and a lot of people knowing about it to get a larger attendance, you can just create an event on Facebook and redistribute, post in groups who are concerned about that thing etc. And you'll get a reasonable attendance of people who might not necessarily even care THAT MUCH. But just want to be a part of something. And despite that, those protests get a lot of media attention.


With the protests here, it's not a niche part of the ""right wing"" or a niche part of the ""left wing"" or feminists or mra or vegans or hunters that protest about a polarized issue. No, it's always a sign of the fact that the whole population is very dissatisfied.

I've not once in my life heard of anyone with a Slavic god's name other than ≈Ωiva, which isn't exclusively a god's name anyway. Then there is also the fact that true Slavic names are actually somewhat uncommon in Slovenia, save for a few, as most are just Slovene versions of names from other cultures. There is almost no evidence of most of the Slavic gods even being present in every Slavic country in the first place and the ones that are present in all of them, exist only in the form of place names, that is how little of the Slavic religion survived.

Compare that to other gods such as Nike, Thor, Loki, Iris, Phoebe, etc and you'll see how few Slavic names are being used in comparison. These names can be found in many countries in the world, not even just in the gods' original cultures. This doesn't even go into other mythological figures, for which there are doubtlessly more as there are almost none preserved from Slavic mythology.

Christians didn't act much differently than in the rest of Europe to the Slavic pagans, the main difference was that Slavs didn't have writing until after they were already Christianised, so most records of their religion was destroyed very early on.

Christians always destroyed pagan places of worship, this is basically a fact. They recorded some things, which is the only reason we know anything about the religion nowadays and would then destroy most of it when converting the local population. Just reading from Carantania's  history, I see records of several pagan rebellions being put down, as well as somewhat historically documented figures destroying thousands of Slavic statues of pagan gods and goddesses after converting to Christianity (Duke Domitian.) Similar events can be found for most Slavic countries.

You say that the religion is well known, but in truth the only thing people know about Slavic gods is what they were gods. Most of this is speculative and if you looked it up you would see that they arrived to the conclusion by comparing it to the gods and goddesses of other European pagan religions. Most of these are also only found in certain locations that were converted to Christianity at a later date and they do not represent Slavic paganism as a whole. What mythological figure is known from Slavic mythology? Almost none, I can't even think of one that isn't a product of the later Christianised Slavs.

Records of pagan gods exist for basically every religion, even Arabian. Slavic pagan religion has been preserved in the same way. You have a list of names and a few of the associated properties of the gods and goddesses, but other than that you know almost nothing and must speculate on and compare their roles to those of other pagan religion's gods to even make any sort of conclusion about them. Modern Slavic paganism is almost completely reconstructed and definitely not accurate to what the pagan religion was.",Slovenia,/r/europe/comments/9wqlln/what_do_you_know_about_the_ottoman_empire/e9upscn/,helppleaseIasknicely,1542416041

3957,"How so? 

They have very little economic growth. They've cut their spending significantly to a 2.4% shortage. To push Italy now to cut more would kill their growth, which would cause a larger shortage which then would just keep on snowballing. Especially since now the world is in a period of economic growth, when recession would happen Italy would be done for if it would cut spending even more. 

On top of this the demands from the EU are very hypocritical since France had an even bigger shortage for years and used the same excuses I lined out above for years. Italy is currently in a situation where its very hard for them to properly recover. The issues of a shared currency persist (meaning they can't devalue currency to attract more investment), high debt coupled with increasing interest rates along with low growth doesn't offer them a clear path. It's obvious the Italian government wants to take the approach to get more growth going which I would say is sensible in a period of economic growth, while Italy's growth is currently sitting at 0.8%. This means that the growth is insufficient to make up for the 2.4% deficit. I don't believe cutting right now will provide a stable path for the future for Italy either, it will turn into Greece and be completely under monetary control of the EU and IMF.

France is in a similar situation as well. It's just that France's debt to GDP ratio is 97% instead of 130% but their debt increases per point have been similar. Whenever a recession will hit the EU will face very large problems in regards to all of the Southern European countries.

As a consequence, Albanian intellectuals meeting in Manastir (present day town of Bitola) in 1908 chose the Latin alphabet as a standard script. The Young Turks, however, were set on maintaining the empire and not interested in making concessions to the myriad nationalist groups within its borders. After securing the abdication of Abd√ºl Hamid II in April 1909, the new authorities levied taxes, outlawed guerrilla groups and nationalist societies, and attempted to extend Constantinople's control over the northern Albanian mountain men. In addition, the Young Turks legalized the bastinado, or beating with a stick, even for misdemeanors, banned carrying rifles, and denied the existence of an Albanian nationality. The new government also appealed for Islamic solidarity to break the Albanians' unity and used the Muslim clergy to try to impose the Arabic alphabet.

4116,"&gt;I think you're making the same mistake in using left to mean anti-authoritarian and right to mean authoritarian.

No.

I'm saying that:   
Left = anti-hierarchical/anti-inequality.     
Right = pro-hierarchical/anti-equality.      

&gt;Many use left to mean fully socialist or state capitalist (with a command or mixed economy) 

1. That makes no sense. As was explained.        
2. The Soviet Union, etc. weren't ""fully socialist"".    
3. Nazis were right wing extremist socialists.    
4. Soviet communists were right wing extremist communists.   

&gt;The issue is one scale is not enough 

What does that even mean?

&gt;and in general scales may not be the best way to graphically think about politics, economy, and social issues. There are actually many variations that make it difficult to use scales, even if we're using multiple ones.

The left vs right spectrum makes entirely sense. You just clearly don't understand it because you believe right wing propaganda. 

You not understanding something doesn't mean it doesn't make sense.

&gt;It's possible to have worker run or state run companies in a free market economy.

Correct. It just will deteriorate over time.

&gt;Most countries are not entirely free market right now

There is no such thing as a free market.

Free markets are only possible when there is perfect equality between people. Free market capitalism is a utopian pipe dream because it doesn't account for human nature.

&gt;the governments interfere to varying degrees.

And in a free market, corporations will become governments. It's just feudalism with extra steps.

&gt;An extreme authoritarian command economy with state run companies is a lot different country than more libertarian with worker run companies and some decentralized economic system, but these are often both incorrectly classified as socialist or communist. 

Correct.

&gt;Social issues also are not dependent on how companies are run or the economic system, it's possible to have an authoritarian capitalist country where the government intervenes enough to protect the rights of minorities, LGBTQ+, etc. It's possible to have a libertarian society with worker run companies where the majority of the public is socially conservative and/or racist, sexist (though it'd be harder since everyone gets a voice, especially sexist (m:f ratio being fairly equal) the minority could be outweighed by the majority).


Correct.

&gt;I do think we need at least an x and a y scale when talking about politics

You can have whatever you want.

Except for obvious bullshit like libertarian propaganda nonsense such as the political compass or similar.

&gt;capitalism on the right, socialism on the left

That's not what left and right mean.

You just need to actually try and understand what left and right wing mean.

Left wing = Do what's best for society as a whole. Improve equality and fight hierarchy.      

Right wing = Do what's best for elites. Decrease equality, establish hierarchy.

Capitalism is always right wing as it always increases inequality and promotes hierarchy. Socialism can be both left (Noam Chomsky) and right wing (Adolf Hitler).


&gt;Just using an x scale (left and right) is way too simplistic and reduces discourse between people with differing views to binary thinking and team sport like tribalism.

It does non of the sort.

You are just falling for obvious right wing propaganda and haven't actually thought about what left and right wing mean.",,/r/europe/comments/9xkquc/we_are_prepared_for_britain_to_cancel_brexit_says/e9tw9e3/,yuropperson,1542393126

He had a 19th-century limestone lion's face that he wanted to reproduce for a line of fountains. But carving each face by hand was a tedious chore for which he no longer had the time or resources.
&gt;
&gt;Instead, he shipped the original work to Studio Roc, where technicians mapped it in three dimensions with a laser scanner. Then they placed a limestone blank in a computer-controlled milling machine and used the scan data to carve a duplicate lion face at the touch of a button.
&gt;

You don't need to hope for the best. It's happening all the time and society is continuously getting better (well, except for the right wing nationalists who fuck everything up, of course).

&gt;All cultures are not equal in their utility to humanity.

Correct. All right wing cultures are harmful to human society.

Yet we tolerate right wingers in our society.

&gt;Diversity 

What?

&gt;identity policies are also bullshit. 

Correct. So why are you promoting them?

&gt;You want equality of opportunity, not outcome. 

Correct. Equality of opportunity is what any left winger supports. I know not a single left winger who supports equality of outcome. Not a single one.

&gt;You want the best of the best in the position in question regardless of identity. 

That is a left wing ideal.

&gt;This checklist of 1 blacks, 1 asians, 1 LGBT, 1 white and 50% women is anti-intellectual and emotional nonsense.

You don't understand the concept or purpose of workplace diversity and should actually study the subject.

Finding my Armenia, a century after the genocide | Financial Times

Lilah Raptopoulos 4 HOURS AGO

In February, Armenia nudged me. I met a stranger who learnt I was Armenian and who asked a completely normal follow-up question: ‚ÄúHave you been?‚Äù

No, I told him. My grandfather and great-grandparents escaped during the Armenian genocide.

Almost all traces of Armenian history from that part of the former Ottoman empire ‚Äî now eastern Turkey ‚Äî have been destroyed. Because the modern-day nation is on land that was never under Ottoman rule, I never thought it would feel like my Armenia. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go, eventually,‚Äù I said. This was language I was repeating. I have been saying it all my life.

‚ÄúHuh,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been wanting to go for some time now, so I might just bite the bullet. My friend went and said she had the best time. It seems to have culture, delicious food, excellent music and mountains. I mean, what more do you need?‚Äù

I blinked. He was going to Armenia? The country, heavy with symbolism in my mind, was not somewhere a tourist could just visit for a cheap week away. If he could ‚Äî which, of course, he could ‚Äî why was I making such a big deal about my own eventual trip?

In May, Armenia nudged me again. The Financial Times was covering the country‚Äôs Velvet Revolution‚Äî Armenians, after a month of entirely peaceful, nationwide protest, unseated their prime minister and replaced him with opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan. The revolution was an overwhelming success. Knowing my background, an editor in our newsroom asked for my

thoughts on it.

‚ÄúTo be honest, I know very little about Armenia the country,‚Äù I told her. In 1922, a few years after the genocide ended, Armenia was incorporated into the Soviet Union, where it remained for 70 years. My mother‚Äôs family always thought Eastern Armenians (those from the nation of Armenia) would be more culturally Russian than those of our heritage, which was influenced more by the Greek, Armenian, Jewish and Ottoman cultures that had coexisted for centuries under Ottoman rule.

We thought of ourselves as Western Armenian, members of the diaspora. When my family left, we took that culture with us in a time capsule. Different food. Different dialect. I heard myself saying these things, and I didn‚Äôt like it. Who was I kidding? Why had I never been to Armenia?

The third time Armenia showed up was in July. I received an invitation to a press event in New York. The poet Peter Balakian, whose 1997 memoir Black Dog of Fate is a resonant exploration of growing up Armenian in America, was due to speak. I was tired, but I felt the pull. So I took the subway uptown.

Halfway through the event, I texted my family‚Äôs group chat.

Live texting you from this Armenia event.

Did you know the oldest known winery is in Armenia?

The food looks insane. Basturma for breakfast!

One of the safest countries in the world?!

OK, they got me. I‚Äôm going. September. Who wants to join?

My sister responded. ‚ÄúSeptember‚Äôs like, tomorrow,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMaybe next year.‚Äù

Meanwhile, Armenia was nudging my mother, too. When I called her that night, she told me about a recent conversation with a woman she knew. ‚ÄúStop waiting for next year,‚Äù the woman had told her. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the moon. What‚Äôs the big deal? Just go!‚Äù

It was the moon. To us, it was the moon. But people have been to the moon. So I booked flights for my parents and me.

With a last name like Raptopoulos, my Greekness is a public fact that I carry everywhere. It is also tangible: I hear it in my father‚Äôs accent, see it on my trips to Greece; I even speak the language, albeit haltingly. But my Armenianness is fully cultural, just an idea. It is something I work overtime to keep alive. My grandmother, my mother and now my sisters and I stuff green peppers with ground beef, rice, cumin. We know how to skewer slippery cubes of lamb into shish kebabs.

One day I called my mother. ‚ÄúI woke up missing my mom today,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm making a cheese boerag.‚Äù As she spoke, she was layering filo dough in a pan, brushing each sheet lovingly and hastily with melted butter, filling the middle with farmer‚Äôs cheese, feta cheese, garlic powder, an egg, then putting it in to bake.

In my hometown of Brookline, Massachusetts, every Armenian I knew was related to me. As a child, I explained the intricacies of the genocide to my American friends‚Äô parents. Not visiting Armenia seemed like procrastination, but it wasn‚Äôt. It was a block. Maybe it represented danger, the source of the trauma. My family, like many in the diaspora, had a misconception of how the country would be. We weren‚Äôt sure we‚Äôd belong. It took a collection of cues to get us there.

I met my parents at the luggage carousel in Yerevan, the capital, at midnight in September, seven months after my first cue. We had flown in separately and were giddy, our senses tingling, everything new and out of context. ‚ÄúIt smells sweet,‚Äù my mother said, a fact that made her happy.

Armenia today is a small, landlocked Christian nation of 2.9 million people. Travel is quite cheap for western tourists, so we organised a driver for the whole trip, Rafael Hovakimyan, and a tour guide for three days in the countryside, Katar Taslakyan. Both became like family; they‚Äôre in half of my photos.

Rafael was at the airport the night we arrived. ‚ÄúArmenia welcomes you,‚Äù he told us. ‚ÄúI know that you will leave this country in love. Everyone does.‚Äù",,/r/europe/comments/9xm1zo/finding_my_armenia_a_century_after_the_genocide/e9twv7i/,ironmakesusplay,1542393566

Again, it's also possible for societies that are non-capitalist and mostly egalitarian to hold backwards beliefs and oppress minorities within their tribe, have patriarchal leadership/traditions, and see other tribes as less than them to be enslaved or killed.

&amp;#x200B;

But even then, no. In fact, the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance were pretty much one of the few official agreements, there was a reason another issue that was highlighted at the end of the war was the problem of ""secret treaties"", because unlike how you're inferring, I actually have studied WW1 much more than you apparently, and these documents that came up were condemned because they were also considered culprits and played a part in WW1.

And these secret agreements were nothing that people knew about, just the governments, the war had NOTHING to do with any ""noble"" ideal. It was nationalism affecting the population, fostered by the government to gain the necessary approval for the war effort and, before the war started, for potential conflicts and population control.

&amp;#x200B;

So for what reason was all of this done? Again, to maintain the power that the UK accumulated, while Germany challenged the British supremacy. The war itself was not decided by the people, it's the governments that issue the go.

4304,"&gt; Actually the EU could've agreed to border checks between NI and RoI 

Not if they wanted a deal passed. Ireland would have vetoed it and no amount of negotiating with us would have been possible over it. The issue of partition, peace in NI, and the GFA goes deeper than trade bloc negotiations at EU level. 

Moreover, your reading of the GFA is inaccurate. While it's technically true that the GFA does not explicitly forbid customs border, or customs border checks, it does commit the UK to 'normalise' the border in a number of important ways.

'Normalis[ing]' the border is an ambiguous, broadly defined item. If you want to see what normalise has meant, the best indicator has been the steps the UK took in the immediate period after GFA was signed. For that you can see that all the border infrastructure was removed, including border security/checks. The border now is merely a political demarcation.

That has been the case now for 20 years, and communities on both sides of the border have accepted it as the status quo. Those communities being stakeholders to the GFA, which wasn't just an international treaty between the UK and RoI. 

A decision thus to try and 'stretch' the GFA status quo by adding in border infrastructure, just based on 'letter of the law' reading of it, would be extremely poorly received, by everyone. That's one of the key indicators about how little England understands about NI. The only people who would be supportive of a hard border (border checks) would be the DUP--and they never signed the GFA or participated in the peace process in the first place.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/9xk3tn/the_brutal_reality_of_brexit_theresa_mays/e9te1yc/,the_straylight_run,1542378590

You're making a shit-ton of assumptions that are based on either your own insecurity, ignorance or just absolutely nothing.

&gt; My own experience

Fair enough, my experience is different (and I've lived in a few cities in 'the north' - Utrecht, Breda &amp; Rotterdam). Most people didn't *care* but wouldn't call the country Holland themself if they were talking about it. 

&gt; Stop spreading bullshit about our country.

I never said any of that mate, I just said that most people outside of the Randstad (in my experience) wouldn't call the country Holland, but say the Netherlands instead. I never said people would get offended, or correct someone. *I* would, but I never said everyone would.

&gt; Limburg has a distinct ""us versus them"" mentality when it comes to the rest of the country

Well, no. I *personally* do, but not even close to everybody. Most people do not really give a fuck. 

&gt;""Hollander"" is a pejorative, to mean ""someone from the Randstad""

Nope, 'Hollander' to me means anybody from above the rivers. Not just the Randstad. I know that's not correct, but it's much more correct than saying Limburg is part of Holland. 

&gt;It basically means ""an outsider"", it means ""not one of us"".

Jezus man, that's how we are treated every single day in the country. As a Limburger you will never properly fit in with people in the north, because you have a soft 'G' and 'R'. We are incorrectly seen as farmers, 'stuck in time' and not part of the Netherlands. Of course we're not gonna say; 'haha yeah, but we still love being a part of the country were we don't get accepted'.

I have never felt a connection with any place in what I would consider 'Holland'. And I do not consider myself to be a Hollander. So of course I would correct someone if they say I am.

Also, you need to have a beer mate. You seem awfully enraged because I 'incorrectly' said 'Most people outside Holland/Randstad do care'. Could've also been a decent human being and not immediately attacked me and my homeplace.

This is true, but you would still need legal standing. As in you would have to be (legally) affected by the legislation in some way. For example [in this ECJ case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6fner_and_Elser_v_Macrotron_GmbH) someone other than the persons being denied employment would have no legal standing to bring a case in front of the courts.

Since EU membership terms are just an internal matter of the member states, i don't see how a person or organisation would have legal standing to sue.

There isn't a solid wall or fence between US and CANADA but that doesn't make it a soft border. 

When you want to cross the border you need to go through customs / report to the nearest border post first and not doing so can land you in jail. The best example is Canusa street where the US/Canada border runs in the middle of the street:

[Article about Canusa Street](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/along-the-us-canadian-border-frayed-ties-and-daily-hassles/2016/05/31/133230cc-241b-11e6-b944-52f7b1793dae_story.html):

The main emigration destinations are in Europe, where about 70% of all migrants go, especially Switzerland. You also need to look at the Germans going back to Germany. In 2005 for example emigrated 144.815 Germans, but 128.000 Germans returned. Don't know why you would leave Europe out of this.


&gt; And socialistic system will collapse in the end - you cannot increase tax rates forever and add more ""free"" stuff

Firstly, no one in Germany would ever call our system socialistic, our left criticises it often for inefficiency, they say you could with a reform make the whole system cheaper and better. And for the infamous tax rates in Germany: Th average person makes 49.915‚Ç¨ per year. Of that he needs to pay 9589‚Ç¨ if he is single, that's 19.2%. If he however is married, that drops to 5.562‚Ç¨, or 11.1%. And if you include the money you get for having children you pay 696‚Ç¨, or 1.4%. (You need to remember that 50% of Germans are below this calculation!) And here is the [Source](http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/steuern-durchschnittsverdiener-zahlen-hoechstens-19-prozent-a-1147997.html) in German, but the info table  should be understandable. 



&gt; you can spend whole day in the clinic, and does not matter if you have an appointment, or not

I would rather spend a whole day in a clinic to get treated before something bad happens that waiting until it happens. My grandma has hip problems and if we didn't have our healthcare system, she prob. wouldn't have the ability anymore to walk and would be bedridden.


&gt; and non-working person receiving social benefits up to the level of working person's income or higher, is nonsense too, this will bring socialistic collapse even closer. 


While there is Hartz IV, it will give you less benefits that working a basic job in a supermarket, and what people always seem to forget while talking about it is that it only applies longer when it is foreseeable that you need help. You can't deny a job you get while having Hartz IV and you are also need to look for jobs while benefiting from it. Then Healthcare, if you have a income over a specific number (don't know atm) you can switch to private healthcare, which is better in some aspects, but costs more.



 And the benefits nearly only come from the fact that you bring the doctor more money, so you get prioritised when getting an appointment, but note: Your appointment doesn't get moved just because a private person wants that time, I'm under private healthcare and your wait for e.g. the dentist still can be a month or so, but bigger problems normally get you nearly instantly to a hospital (I once vomited everything up I drank/ate, including water, and I got instantly to the hospital just with my parents saying I'm vomiting) so that isn't a problem.

4558,"&gt; It would probably be best for the internet to drop both Article 11 and Article 13 altogether

Good idea. I'm just concentrating on Article 11, the link tax that will allow publishers to demand compensation from information society service providers (not individuals, not organizations, not archives) that show their snippets. Without Article 11 Google News can continue to 

1. not run in Spain, because they would have to pay everyone they list a compensation, without the chance to opt-out
2. demand zero-cost licensing agreements in Germany and only list publishers that agreed to that
3. not show newspaper publishers represented by Copiepresse in Belgium to not be fined 25,000‚Ç¨ per day for continued copyright infringement
5. prepare for link taxes in [Poland and Austria](https://www.politico.eu/article/plan-to-make-google-pay-for-news-hits-rocks-copyright-reform-european-commission/), and
4. risk getting sued for copyright infringement in any EU country where the rules aren't cleared up already (that would be Spain and Germany)

Much better than

1. demand zero-cost licensing agreements in each EU country and list only publishers that agreed to that

as a consequence of Article 11. No one needs harmonized law anyway. Making your site compliant for 27 countries is good for the internet. 

----

But let's discuss the individual items on the thenetisdead.net site

&gt; - A link tax has been tried before in both Germany and Spain and ended up being a disaster in both places, leading to no new payments to media organizations, less overall access to news for the public, and significant harm to smaller publishers.

It hasn't only tried, it's in place. And it will stay in place, no matter what the pirate party thinks. 

If someone is harmed it's news aggregator. The small publishers can just opt-out from collecting fees. And with Article 11 they can do it in all EU countries. Right now they can't opt-out in Spain. 

&gt; - Media publishers already have tools, such as robots.txt to stop aggregators from scraping their site. That they choose not to suggests that they see and appreciate the value they get from aggregators who send them traffic.

Countless courts have ruled that media publishers are not required to opt-out, and that copyright infringement happens even if they allow access in their robots.txt. That's the reality content aggregators have to live in. They constantly risk getting sued for copyright infringement because there are no clear EU-wide rules. That for example reddit isn't sued for showing unlicensed snippets of news isn't because EU law currently allows those. There is no such thing as fair-use in most EU countries. As Belgium (Google News v. Copiepresse) and France (Google News v. AFP) has shown you can be found guilty for showing snippets

Not making the publishers responsible for preventing infringement by news aggregators makes a lot of sense, because news aggregators decide which sites they show, so they have a full list of publishers they have to ask for a zero-cost licensing agreement. Publishers on the other hand don't know who will query their site, so they don't know which user-agents to put in their robots.txt before they have queried their site. Forcing them to opt-in into regular search engines by specifying a catch-all user-agent that blocks all access is not an option either. 

&gt; - The initial wording of Article 11 is extremely vague, such that there is reasonable fear that some will interpret it to mean that mere links that include just 1 or a few words from the story or headlines violates the rules.

The amended wording is not that vague in regards to ""1 or a few words"". The amended version says: ""2a. The rights referred to in paragraph 1 shall not extend to mere hyperlinks which are accompanied by individual words.""

I would bet quite a lot of money that no court will hold anyone responsible for copying the headline, but granted the paragraph should be amended to explicitly allow the use of the complete headline to link to an article. 

&gt; - Many media sites actually would prefer to share their works for free, and support open access systems and tools, including open licenses like Creative Commons -- some of which might not be allowed under interpretations of Article 11.

Who made that interpretation of Article 11? 

Because in my version it says ""The rights referred to in paragraph 1 shall leave intact and shall in no way affect any rights provided for in Union law to authors and other rightholders, in respect of the works and other subject-matter incorporated in a press publication."". The rightholders have the right to decide the licensing of their content, and Article 11 leaves that right intact. 

&gt; - Under the existing vague terms, what sites qualify as a media site is already vague, which could cause confusion and additional problems as lots of sites clamor for payments from the licenses for news aggregation.

How is it vague? ""(4) ‚Äòpress publication‚Äô means a fixation by publishers or news agencies of a collection of literary works of a journalistic nature, which may also comprise other works or subject-matter and constitutes an individual item within a periodical or regularly-updated publication under a single title, such as a newspaper or a general or special interest magazine, having the purpose of providing information related to news or other topics and published in any media under the initiative, editorial responsibility and control of a service provider.

4605,"Of course actual bullying sucks but the problem isn't where it happens, the problem is the parents. Your kid shouldn't bully others, shouldn't hit others, shouldn't steal etc. etc. and it's up to you to teach them that. The parents should be embarrassed and should act. If your child is a bully you've failed as a parent.

The idea that everything that happens online is somehow automatically worse or different is ridiculous to me. ""Online bullying"" is just bullying. If your child isn't a bully he or she is very unlikely to be an ""online bully"" either. It's not some separate issue.

Obviously being online (or on the phone to call people for that matter) is different in the way that you can't exactly *physically* bully people from a distance but the mentality is the same. I don't know why it's treated as if it's somehow so much worse, it seems like it's just that politicians have no clue how younger people and children use the internet. 

Then there's the fact that people keep trying to include more and more in ""bullying"" which just waters down the meaning. Kids having a heated argument and calling each other idiots isn't bullying for example, kids getting angry and each other and ending up in a fight isn't bullying either, kids not liking everyone to the same degree isn't bullying etc. If a kid comes to school every day and is mocked, made fun of, isn't allowed to ever be a part of anything etc. that's bullying, and I'd honestly say that IRL bullying is the worst thing. On the internet you can always find someone else to play a game with, you can always find someone with the same interests as you, you can block/ignore assholes etc. You can't do that in school or wherever. And if you somehow managed to get rid of IRL bullying, that'd have a huge impact on ""online bullying"" as well.

If you simply can't handle someone calling you an idiot online, if you can't handle disagreements, if you can't handle trolls, if you can't handle swearing etc. you just shouldn't be online. Some people are just assholes just like in the real world and they love to annoy others to get a reaction.

While actual bullying is indeed bad it's by no means such a big issue that it should be allowed to be used to destroy the online anonymity. People should be able to discuss touchy issues online without anyone else being able to vandalize their homes, without threatening their kids etc. The internet would be a much scarier place *without* anonymity, also for kids. Imagine someone knowing who your child was, where he or she lived etc. because they had been active online. Would that really make parents *less* concerned?

[This](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Northern_Mali_conflict.svg) was the situation in Mali in January 2013. By May 2013 the French had taken controll of all major cities and then gave back controll to the Malian military. That's it. They did what they set out to do. Also Libya is hardly a cut and dry ""real military conflict"" because there are many insurgencies and factions involved and it's an incredible shit show of is own.

But anyway you are missing the point of my comment. You used one example to prove how according to you the French are incompetent and I gave a very recent example of how they can be very efficient and also pointed out examples of how the US has fucked up on his own right. That's it. I'm trying to point out that military conflicts are hardly cut and dry and sometimes operations are successful and sometimes they are not. But at the end of day what people in here are trying to say is that the US as an ally is becoming incredibly volative especially since 9/11. 

You had Bush that started 2 wars in the Middle East, one of which was an illegal invasion based on lies that cost thousands upon thousands of innocent lives not to mention that when countries like France refused join they were called untrustworthy cowards. Than Obama comes along and immediately start pulling troops out and which causes a power vacuum that arguably brought the rise of ISIS. After that you have Trump which is the polar opposite of Obama and he start talking shit regularly about all the US allies, start trade wars with the EU, Canada and China, threatens about a war with Iran and becames all buddy buddy with Putin. Not mention reversing any deal he could that was made by his predecessor or how he refuses to openly support NATO article 5. And all this is just the tip of the iceberg. Regardless of which of them you agree with more the bottom line is that the US as a whole has become an unreliable ally and in foreign relations consistency is everything.

Well, at least it makes vehicles and people very hard to see on a [infrared camera.](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/27/scientists-develop-thermal-camouflage-that-can-fool-infrared-cameras)

Not sure how far and relevant ""blackbody radiation"" is for satellites. Reading on wikipedia doesn't make me really understand it, but it also seems to be mostly about light that is reflected and changed during reflection. Maybe something like vantablack could change that, too, because only a very, very small part of the light is reflected(only 0.035%)?

&gt; In contrast a drone controlling satellite necessarily has to be transmitting down right where the enemies also are.

Not so sure about that ""constant"" part, because that would be a major drawback and turn the satellites into clay pigeons. I'm pretty sure drones are not going to be controlled by humans at this point. That would make the entire point of them quite questionable. 10 more years of AI research and industrial experience with auto-pilots will mean a lot. So maybe short bursts of information - not long enough to be pinned down exactly - would be enough. For example about enemy movement, target priority and so on. Or maybe even some form of communication based on quantum entanglement. But i guess we wouldn't need any satellites at all at this point.

People are asked if they speak Scots, many don't call it Scots, instead, many call it slang and don't recognise it as a separate dialect, it's only certain regions that will say they speak Scots, but the term Scots has grown in popularity in recent years, a census would show a different outcome today.

These people come from a region (Glasgow) where they would say they speak slang English, not Scots.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le\_uNGdpa4c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le_uNGdpa4c)

Whereas someone from Aberdeen who would be more intelligible in speaking would say he speaks Scots (Doric). Of course you will have a hard time knowing certain old Scots words, but most of the words both a Glaswegian and an Aberdonian communicate in is English, it's just you will understand an Aberdonian's English easier than a Glaswegian, but both do have their own Scottish take on those English words. But an Aberdonian will still say that even the English words they speak are part of the Scots dialect, which is a valid argument, but a Glaswegian won't typically say it's a different dialect, they'd call it slang.

4856,"I think that our Conservative, ""small government, personal liberty"" politicians deserve some international attention, as well.

To a very minor extent, I agree with her. It should be possible to investigate serious offenses committed online. But that's something completely different from the sentiment of not allowing people to be anonymous, and from talking about anonymity as if itself is something negative. Anonymity is the very thing that allows the average person to avoid being targeted. It's something that allows people to take part in the global community, online communities, without fear of being attacked for who they are or for their harmless personal interests.

Anonymity prevents bullying. It prevents classmates, employees, politicians from being able to track you outside of the arenas that are their concern. Anonymity also prevents commercial entities from finding out even more about you, and in general prevents people with hostile intentions from immediately finding out who you are so that they can target you in real life.

This (the article) is what our Prime Minister is saying, while our Defence Minister, also a Conservative Party member, wants to give Norway a PATRIOT Act level of removal of protections, and implement [surveillance of all internet traffic](https://www.nrk.no/norge/vil-la-e-tjenesten-lagre-nordmenns-nett-trafikk-1.14291174) that crosses the border. Which for a small country like Norway without a lot of online services based entirely within the country, pretty much means that everything that everyone who lives in Norway does online will be stored for 18 months (at least).

4890,"&gt; I don't think the South Vietnamese would have liked

and here is the answer......Americans wanted to wage a ''civil'', ''humane'' war, where everyone would hold up big posters all around Vietnam thanking them for their invasion and being happy for it. Reality is Vietnamese didnt want them there and would not give up on that sentiment, if US wanted to win they would have to break them and force them to accept their status quo. It would need to be a brutal war where there is no good guy. Thats how Soviet union won control over Eastern Europe, they didnt ask if people there wanted Communism, they killed you or sent you to Siberia if you didnt want it. Thats how Napoleon and Caesar was able to achieve what they did in the war department, if the enemy doesnt accept you being there he wont just change his mind willingly. If US had no desire to fight a war like that, they should have never started it in the first place.

The US Navy keeps the oceans clear for German exports.  The German Navy is a joke.  It doesn't even dominate the Baltic.  It's amazing how deluded you are about the true strength of the German military.  The Germans have [literally had to use broomsticks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/02/19/germanys-army-is-so-under-equipped-that-it-used-broomsticks-instead-of-machine-guns/) in place of machine guns and [only 8 of their 109 Eurofighters are operational.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11057330/German-fighter-jets-unable-to-fly-and-mechanics-forced-to-borrow-spare-parts-claims-magazine.html) 

The US fought the Cold War to keep the Russians off Western European soil, and mitigated ethnic tensions in the region, and all we got in return was European propaganda about how imperialistic and colonial the US is from the very guys who fucked the world up in the first place. It's a total farce and it's high time it came to a screeching halt.

For most small things that's fine, but the moment you get a severe infection or need to fend off a serious disease you're screwed if you don't properly treat it. For a cough or a sore limb though? No need to do anything serious about it or see a doctor; most the time it'll go away on its own within a few days or a couple weeks. Over treatment can be a problem in some western countries, sure. But you don't solve that problem by replacing aggressive treatments with bogus ones. Rather, just don't unnecessarily go for treatments when not warranted. I know some people that insist on getting antibiotics whenever they get a cough. That's bull. But what's even more bull is them paying for some sugar water sold by someone who promises the sugar water will to X when it won't.

The US is certainly not an enemy, but currently not a reliable partner either. Hopefully that will change, but there is no political imperative at the moment to keep it from changing back and forth like this. The EU needs a backup plan.

Because bashing the EU for its lack of military strength is common, it might surprise you that even without the UK, the EU total military expenditure is roughly double that of Russia and about par with that of China, and its equipment more than comparable in numbers and quality with Russia's. On paper the EU is at the same level with China or Russia, but not in actual capability.

It's not army size, quality, or even budget that's the problem. It's cohesion, integration and the extra costs of having many separate military apparatuses and supply chains, and conflicting political wills. That's what a common EU army could fix.

When was this ever *not* the case?  We're talking about the country that gave loans to the Nazis, helped them count the Jews to get them into the concentration camps, and then hired all the Nazis afterwards to run the West German government.

Well alright, I know this sub is pretty strongly set in hating Article 13, but since you have a list that's actually explaining what's supposedly wrong, let me break down why it's not:

&gt;Myth 1: [...] **if** Article 13 imposes direct liability on platforms before potential copyright infringement

See this 'if'? That's because it doesn't. They can say this because there's another revision coming, but the version last voted on doesn't have this direct liability.

The whole myth-bust depended on that not being the case, so... still a myth.

&gt;Myth 2

Nothing wrong here, Article 13 is not law in Europe. ...Not that directives *can* become law.

&gt;Myth 3

""Youtube supports the premise""? No it doesn't, pretty much the whole thing that got this started was people complaining about Youtube's copyright system! If they *actually* supported a fair copyright system, they would have implemented it themselves.

And no, Youtube won't compromise. The side of the next page is them explicitly staying they'll block 35 million channels if this directive gets passed.

&gt;Myth 4

It's also not wrong (in my personal opinion, anyway - a lot of people are much more against the idea of ads), but... what do ads to do with the directive?

&gt;Myth 5

5048,"Got it. So you want to study now but are making long term plans already. 

Some things will change in the next 3(?) years you'll attend university. Germany for example currently wants to make immigration easier for skilled immigrants. 

But studying IT already means you have good chances to qualify for a [EU Blue Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Card_\(European_Union\)). That's a program that's available in all EU countries except Denmark, Ireland, and the UK. So unless you want to move to one of those countries there's litte point to look at any other option to obtain a work visa.   

There's basically two requirements. One is a university degree, you are working on that.    
The other requirement is a binding job offer with a salary higher than 1.5 the average annual gross salary in that country. That threshold is calculated each year and in Germany it is currently 52,000‚Ç¨. But since IT is a job group that is heavily in need in Germany the requirement is lower, currently 40,560‚Ç¨.   
Some countries do use a labour market test to prioritize EU citizens over people on Blue Cards. You have to check if the country of your choice does. Germany for example doesn't, but Poland does. So if you want a blue card in Poland the employer has to show that they can't find a suitable candidate in the EU. Romania doesn't apply a labour market test either, and the official gross salary is 3131 RON (~671‚Ç¨) per month. So to qualify for a Blue Card you would need an annual income of around 12,000‚Ç¨ in Romania. 

But these are just two examples. All countries in the EU are great places to live. Pick a country you like or where you think you would fit in and care about job prospects later. You will spend a lot of time in the country you choose. As a worker on a Blue Card you do not enjoy freedom of movement like EU citizens do. You cannot just move to another country with applying for another Blue Card. 

PS: If you google for ""Blue card {country}"", look for links that look like they're from the government or the EU. There's many agencies that want your money for information that you can find for free. Don't pay them.

But that's not what the catalog is of. It's of the locations of all the objects and what they are. There isn't any particular signal so even if there was a categorization based on the signals it emits then you would have to fake all of them.

2) I meant more in the category of satellites already have difficulty managing heat.

As to against the Earth I mean you could deploy a cone shaped mylar balloon to reflect any radar waves coming from Earth away into space (that's presumed to be how the Misty satellites work). But it has to be in a fairly high (and thus expensive) orbit for that to not make it super obvious from other locations and to make it so you can avoid flashing the Earth with the reflection of the sun in that balloon. 

And lastly my point was that Misty theoretically works because it can choose when it transmits and doesn't have to do so constantly.

5170,"One of the main factors that is never really discussed is how rushed the referendum was. Between announcement and voting day was 4-5 months, to put that into perspective the Scottish independence referendum was a year and a half. Considering the implications for each vote you'd expect Brexit to have a longer interim period to discuss the implications. So you have to ask why? I mean all the discussions that we should have had as a country, pretty much happened after the vote with plenty of lies or just absent information (NI border), and it's been an absolute mess since then. So why was it rushed?  

Below is a conspiracy theory but I think there's some meat to it. 

Anyway imho the new EU law in regards to a clamp down on tax havens had a significant influence, but that's the lover-of-a-conspiracy in me. But if you imagine UK prime minister Cameron actually wanted Brexit after hearing that papers, that implicated him and other powerful people (UK is the tax haven capitol of the world for elites), were stolen from mossack fonseca (panama papers) and allow for involved people knowing that information had been stolen about them, before the media released the information. Then the dates between the Panama papers being stolen ( leaked documents started being sent to the German newspaper at the beginning of 2015), EU clamp down announcement (January 28 2016), brexit announcement (22nd February 2016), lies told on leave side, weak benefits listed for remaining or consequences of leaving over the next few months.  Panama papers release (9th May 2016) and subsequent champion of remain, prime minister Cameron, became embroiled in a family tax scandal THAT HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT BEFOREHAND, and could have swayed on the fence voters due to his untrustworthyness (may 2016 but didn't immediately resign), Brexit vote (23rd June 2016). Leave vote wins by narrow margin. Cameron resigns and tax avoidance questions with it. Article 50 triggered asap. Brexit becomes main topic since then and the why is the UK the tax haven of the world conversation disappears. And the elites around the world get to keep the tax haven capitol that is the UK, exempt from the EU anti tax avoidance law, which will benefit a lot of rich people the world over including rich Europeans.

You can't have customs union without accepting governing legislative body over the whole region concerning trade. It's that simple. It's one borderless entity in trade and also acts like it when it comes to making ""free trade"" deals or similar between other entities.

5196,"&gt; Please explain how the rest of the world is freeloading of the US?

European (and the rest of the world's) exports are protected by the American taxpayers funding the US Navy as it keeps the shipping routes open all around the world. Without this free-as-in-beer protection, Europe not only would have to fund a navy (ruinously expensive) but get convoys together and sail them back and forth between markets.  

&gt;You really don't seem to understand how NATO works.

I understand just fine.  America pays, Europe benefits.  And laughs at the suckers who do all of it for free.

&gt; The 2% norm reflects the contribution of a nation to its own military

it's not a ""norm"" it's a *minimum* and only a few NATO countries can even bother do to that.  They're freeloading.  For example, Germany is a security free-rider that exploits American generosity to run a massive trade surplus.  For a country flush with cash and a large budget surplus, it should be able to spend 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense.  They refuse to do so.  And why should they, when they have an idiot to do it for them?  


&gt;It has only been invoked once, guess which nation?

5206,"&gt; One could argue that a sea-based missile, such as the Tomahawk, could be launched
from land if its launcher were deployed on land. In that case, the launcher could be considered a
ground-based launcher, even if it had never been tested with a ground-launched missile. This
seems to be the source of Russia‚Äôs complaint. However, even if it seems somewhat logical, it is
not consistent with the INF Treaty‚Äôs definition. The treaty specifies that the launcher must launch
an intermediate-range GLCM, not any intermediate-range cruise missile, to qualify as a system
banned by the treaty.
Moreover, U.S. officials have asserted that the version of the MK-41 system to be based in
Romania and Poland will not be the same as the shipboard version that has been used to launch
Tomahawk cruise missiles, even though it will use ‚Äúsome of the same structural components as
the sea-based system.‚Äù
103 According to some reports, the ‚Äúelectronics and software of the Aegis
Ashore Mk-41 launcher are different than the ship-borne variant.‚Äù104 The Trump Administration
reiterated this point in a fact sheet released by the State Department in December 2017. It noted
that the Aegis Ashore system ‚Äúis only capable of launching defensive interceptor missiles.‚Äù The
system uses ‚Äúsome of the same structural components as the sea-based Mk-41 Vertical Launch
System‚Äù but it ‚Äúis not the same launcher as the sea-based MK-41 Vertical Launch System.‚Äù The
system ‚Äúlacks the software, fire control hardware, support equipment, and other infrastructure
needed to launch offensive ballistic or cruise missiles such as the Tomahawk.‚Äù
105
This distinction would seem to undercut the Russian view that the launcher used in Aegis Ashore
‚Äúcan be used to launch intermediate-range cruise missiles.‚Äù However, convincing Russia of this
difference may be difficult. In past arms control agreements, the parties have mandated that
similar systems with different purposes possess functionally related, observable differences. This
is not required under the INF Treaty, and it is not clear at this time whether this will be the case
for the land-based MK-41 launchers. As a result, even though the treaty definitions may not
capture the system unless it actually launches a cruise missile from land, the United States may
find it helpful, for political reasons, to take additional steps to address Russia‚Äôs concerns and
convince Russia that the system does not violate the INF Treaty.

So basically from US PoV that's not violation since Aegis ashore lacks hardware for launching Tomahawks. Although, maybe you can remake it into tomahawk capable launcher relatively fast which is forbidden under the treaty. 

Has Russia asked for inspection of those, or have they simply complained? ",Ukraine,/r/europe/comments/9x8bm4/these_missiles_can_reach_berlin_warns_lithuanias/e9rqcg1/,Aken_Bosch,1542313847

If you want the EU to be something more than it is, then you negotiate for it. That's how politics works. What DOESN'T work is signing a treaty that agrees to an arrangement but then unilaterally deciding that you want something else and expecting the other side to just roll over and give that to you simply because you want it. If you think that's how it works, then move to America and apply to work for Donald Trump because he's looking for people like you.

Ireland has selectively opted in to parts of PESCO as is our right. Those are peaceful, defensive programmes, in line with Irish foreign policy. If you want to convince Ireland that it's a good idea to sign up to more, to be part of a grand European army, you'll have to do a LOT to convince us that it won't be used to start wars of aggression, or of ""liberation"" as modern-day warmongers like to spin it. Because I don't know if you've noticed, but Europe has a history of colonization as a way of ""civilizing the savages"" and is making a lot of similar noises with a wave of white/Christian nationalism sweeping the continent. And the Middle East is *just over there*, and Africa is *right over there*. Remember Libya? The nation that America and Europe decided to bombard with a few missiles and then walked away just as quickly just as soon as Ghaddafi was gone? That civil war's still going, not that anyone cares, evidently. Why should anyone believe that a unified European military would be used in a responsible way?

Going back to those PESCO projects that Ireland has opted into, [let's look at them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Structured_Cooperation#Projects), shall we? Military mobility... OK... coordinated training... OK... Maritime surveillance... uh oh! Where's Sweden? Disaster relief... where's Sweden? Cyber security... where's Sweden?

5279,"Hogwash is a stupid way to respond to a point in a debate.

My talking points come from four historians who have dedicated their careers to American history. This information is also readily available with a simple google search.

France began assisting us in a significant way in 1775 and they had been helping in a limited capacity for many years before that as well. Help in the form of strategy and material continued up to the Treaty of Alliance, which was effectively a defensive alliance with subtle and even secret provisions. France had recently lost most of their presence in North America due to the French and Indian war and they were itching to fight with England due to the power struggle favoring the English after the Seven Years‚Äô War. Instead of engaging directly, France chose to manipulate the situation by assisting the US as a way to occupy and, more importantly, split British forces.

Case in point, estimates regarding the arms used in a few campaigns - most notably Saratoga - were supplied by France instead of the colonies at a ratio of nearly 9 to 1. Those battles were completely lost without French support and that was at the most vital point in the war - the beginning.

Troops don‚Äôt win wars unless you have none left, so your number is both irrelevant and a distraction. We had the man power to accomplish our goals without more feet on the ground, though not with enough margin to feel comfortable. France didn‚Äôt need to send men to exert a heavy influence, however, as military strategy exported to the colonies coupled with its own agenda in Europe.

After France‚Äôs official entry into the war in 1777, the treaty it had with Austria influenced the American Revolution as well. France was able to make more aggressive moves because the alliance meant Austria would help defend from a British invasion.

The French committed somewhere between 2500 and 3000 men to the battle of Savannah, which was likely more than we contributed actually. The 6000 men you spoke of were mainly used to guard the fleet and, perhaps more importantly, as a show of strength and deterrent. Again, this wasn‚Äôt the primary French contribution. Materials like gun powder and strategy were just as valuable as men. They chose how many men to supply strategically; American reception of foreign troops was a question mark, so they sent enough to provide support, but not so many that it would anger colonial leadership.

Estimates of French expenses directly due to the war effort are around 1.2 million livres. France‚Äôs direct intervention, especially in major campaigns like Yorktown, led to victories that otherwise would not have been achieved. Our ability to wage war against Britain was not sufficient to win without serious assistance. France definitely changed the game for us even though the underlying reasons were undoubtedly numerous in reason and scope.

The book called _The French Navy and American Independence_ goes into great detail about why the French fleet and overall support changed the tide of the war. Washington flat out would have lost Yorktown without the French fleet doing its thing. That victory essentially ended the war.

We would not have successfully negotiated for the land south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi without decisive victories, thus lending even more credence to the notion that France‚Äôs involvement changed everything.

Sadly, it seems we did not return the favor when we decided to remain neutral in 1793 during the next war. Their influence waned once the war came to an end especially after we basically screwed them out of their bargaining power.

Let‚Äôs not forget the French influence over the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution. It‚Äôs especially interesting how much they helped with what was essentially intellectual property given their distaste for the colonies being primarily Protestant.",,/r/europe/comments/9x7tew/france_a_historic_ally_of_us_not_a_vassal_state/e9rrduy/,ThePoultryWhisperer,1542314613

The issue with being a well off country in a system that wants to unify everything though is that you'll always end up giving more than you get. That can be somewhat off set by the benefits of working together, e.g. More military power, buffer political pull. But if those benefits aren't being wielded in a way that benefits you, it makes them moot points.

What are you talking about? You're acting as if saying ""we're your ally not your vassal state"" is a declaration of war which is ridiculous. France just wants to be treated as an equal.


&gt; More US soldiers died in WW2 to save Europe than French soldiers did

Weird flex to start talking about WW2 when Trump's comments were about the past decade, but sure let me entertain your weird comment by applying logics. Judging something like military deaths by raw number is stupid. You need to relate it to the population of the countries. How could you expect a nation like France (41mil citizens in 1939) to have an equally big army as the United states (148m citizens in 1939)?

France suffered the death of 218,000 French soldiers without even counting the militias and resistance fighters, that's 0,53% of its population. The US suffered 416,000 deaths, that's 0,28%.

So your comment was misleading to say the least, but even if it did make sense: European countries are starting to invest more into their army so why would that warrant a hostile reaction from Trump if he previously complained they didn't invest enough?

If we go even deeper we see as well that the famous and iconic Black Church was build using mostly Bulgarian builders and craftsmen, or that exist an even older church than Black Church, the Romanian orthodox Sf Nicolae (St Nicholas) church at just few hundred meters from it, on the other side of the Schei Gate (there is also the first Romanian school, established in XVI century, first one that used Romanian language for teaching).

Again, I don't want to detract anything from the Saxons which left their mark for sure and is quite an important period for Brasov. But it is just a period, I mean just the neolitic and bronze age settlements cover maybe ten times more time as historical period, and today Saxon heritage cover maybe 10, anyway less than 20% of the city area. Saxons however have most of the time quite good relations with Romanians in Transilvania (probably true many times as well for common folks Romanians and Hungarians at least at individual level, it was the noble/church folks and later nationalism that messed up that, up to today, and their refuse to recognize the Romanian heritage and majority).

5489,"Ehh, the problems with me trying to make subtle distinctions is the fact that it might appear like I'm contradicting myself to people with black-and-white morality and just generally the ones unfamiliar with my thought patterns... It's quite an old post now, so I won't make my answer particularly long:

What I meant by saying that ""nobody should stop listening to anything"" is that closing off your society or government to different/foreign viewpoints has always been a path into an oblivion. Of course the government and the society should listen and analyse any and all accusations/judgements that come from people that have been hurt by them in the past. 

What I'm saying is that these messages don't have to be accepted as truth and especially shouldn't be continually broadcast throughout the country. If an internal analysis shows that there indeed was a great wrong committed by a country/government towards the complaining group, then a formal apology and an inclusion of the event in question into the history books would be in order.  \*\*HOWEVER\*\* - not all accusations should just be accepted at face value. Think of the recent Polish insanity demanding fucking reparations 70 years later. After receiving a third of Prussia (with housing and equipment) all that time ago already, \*while still receiving massive German assistance\* through various EU programmes, all the while undermining and complaining about them continuously... Should that be entertained and accepted?   Should they be ""treated with sincerity""? It it still worth ""Listening to the people that got hurt, however hard their judgement might be"" in this case?

That's my point. There definitely needs to be acceptance and condemnation of well-known black pages in the national past but there is absolutely no need to permanently grovel in front of \*\*descendants\*\* of victims from 70+ years ago. We, in ex-USSR understand it due to our lack of ""martyrdom worship"". Our western neighbours - not quite.

Additionally, the GDR accepted the border to Poland in 1950, whereas West Germany accepted (though with reservations) this border in 1970. Accepted being wildly different from the term relevant in international law; recognised.

5662,"Us today cannot imagine the misery in Central Europe by 1918. Since most men were either at the frontlines, in pow camps or working in factories, there was barely anyone left to work the fields (although I should add it was common to leave one son at home to ensure family survival). Add the fact that 1917-1918 had particularly bad weather (at least in Austria-Hungary certainly) and thus bad crops which would have made them pretty harsh years even in peacetime, of course grain trade could've aliavated trade but not in WW1 with blockades and most of Russia's best fertile land under war or occupation. Requirations were commonplace, but to add insult to injury, if you were a noble in good ranks with certain politicans you could avoid that. Indeed, many new mansions  were built *during the war* from the huge income these lords got thanks to agricultural produce prices rocketing up. Meanwhile, despite millions of peasents fighting and dying on the front, in 1918 the German consule to Hungary blamed *their mentality* for the increasingly bad war outlook.  

Inflation was getting larger by the month, making many agricultural workers poorer as they got less and less for their goods. The situation was so bad that in 1918 august-september peasents simply couldn't go work on the fields *as they couldn't afford even the shittiest boots*, as all of them were kept for the military. And we are talking about total garbage paper-boots by this point.  

I can go on and on about the many horrible and jaw-dropping things that were happening then. For example due to exodus of Jews from Galizia anti-semitism was on steady rise. As a reaction the leader of the Hungarian Parliament, Istv√°n Tisza (pm until 1917) both condemned anti-semitism but also called out Jews to restrain from economic and business offenses, basically making both parties angry. To get unity in the parliament they striken a deal with the social-democrats (grossly under-represented party which likely enjoyed the greatest popular support, but since only wealthy males could vote, well) to give more people voting rights, of course they ignored this too, citing the war situation. Said Tisza made such quotes like ""The party that will let women vote will lose all esteem"".  

Many people today have some wildy varying ideas about why leftists and outright communists surfaced so hard in Austria-Hungary and Germany as WW1 ended, why was the old system so hated, why did the governements collapse so abruptly, why did such a huge chaos of destruction, anarchy and hopes, right or false explode.

I haven't said that it will lead to giving up of NATO. It will lid to being less dependent on NATO and will mean that in cases where EU can they would probably decide - we won't put there US and NATO base. We just put there European Army base.

5689,"&gt; Language isn't some static thing you can enshrine for all eternity.

But it isn't just a way of speaking you can switch willy-nilly either. Every time a language (or one of its variants, such as dialects) dies out, a whole culture and certain world view dies along with it. 

And please do note that speaking a dialect doesn't mean that one were incapable of speaking the standard language of the country; it usually means that you're able to speak both. That's particularly true for today's standard German. German dialects aren't variations of a standard language, but standard German was *constructed* in the 16^th and 17^th century as the lowest common denominator of German dialects.

5705,"1. Quote, '*if your profession involves giving advice to people about said fields*'. Even then liability should clearly be limited and the group of advisors bearing such responsibility be very strictly defined. Such professions should not exempt the advised from responsibility for their own actions. (I am aware of situations where responsibility shifts entirely and the person receiving the advice is not held responsible in the end, but these are very much exceptional and usually involve criminal liability (at least in Hungary) - and don't come easy even then.)
2. The default stance of the law should be that everybody is responsible for his own actions - and deciding between conflicting recommendations is an action, too. Being accountable for persons acting on one's advice without boundaries is quite insane to think of - there's a lot of well-meaning advice-giving going on in everyday social interactions.
3. Can a legally competent adult refuse treatment on his own volition? Absolutely. I don't know how that case happened, but have an assumption that the deceased had to be informed by his doctors of the consequences of his refusal and had had to declare his intentions. Can we argue that believing bad advice strips one from legal competence? Should there have been legal action taken to treat Mario against his expressed will on the grounds of incompetence? Because if we wish to hold the quack criminally liable for the death of Mario, a responsibility to *prevent* that murder arises - and I cannot interpret that but ultimately opening the way for treating a patient against his will, which would require declaring him incompetent.

Incredibly ironic thing to write considering what came after it was a early 20th century outlook on warfare.

Your entire comment relies on a war between Europe and the EU turning into a war of attrition ala WW1 or 2. Cold War drills had the USSR going from the DMZ to France in a matter of days. How would the paltry and disorganised forces of the EU stop the 2nd or 3rd most powerful military in the world (and the most mechanised army in the world) from breaking through any thin lines in Ukraine in hours.

After they're through Europe is in trouble. Russia's aim in any war would be to overwhelm before Europe had the time to react in the way you described. What makes you think Europe would have months or years required to mobilise it's whole industry and population? Nonsense.

Half the population want to leave and so do both the main political parties. I'm a remainer but we have to face reality that the UK isn't happy in the EU and another referendum returning a narrow remain majority isn't going to solve the problem. 

We need a new relationship with the EU. As the EU won't compromise on membership and it's drive towards an ever closer union, the only hope for an arrangement the UK public will accept is to leave but retain as close a relationship as possible.

The referendum wasn't the problem, a new one won't solve it.

Not only is it matter of popular opinion, but also voter turn out, what are the exact questions positioned etc. Latest polls I saw where still rather neck and neck on the public opinion.

Also any referendum done would be only advisory. UK is a parliamentary democracy with a sovereign parliament (Thus was actually decided on regarding Brexit. Government wanted to give a notice only based on the referendum and High Court said *this involves making and breaking of legislation, only party powered to do that in UK is the Parliament*). Only entity with the power to ultimately decide this is UK Parliament. Which may look for advisory referendum, or not. Also follow the referendum or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

Only way this was pure referendum, was Parliament making an explicit special law saying they have decided to subject the matter to direct referendum. Even then as I understand, there is legal debate whether Parliament in any case has power to delegate it's legislative power in this way. Even more prudently, Houses of Parliament would never do such law, since they value their sovereign power and don't want precedent of giving it up even tiny bit.
