106,"If I remember correctly the quota would have meant that the EU would take 120 000 refugees (54 000 refugees from Hungary, the other from Italy and Greece) and redistribute them to other EU countries with Germany taking 30 000. Hungary voted against that, because they wanted no quotas at all so the 54 000 was granted to Italy and Greece instead. The other side of the story was that Hungary would have to take 1 300 refugees in return. They basically had a redistribution key were refugees would be redistributed from border countries(Hungary, Italy, Greece) to countries according to population size and the economy.

The second part of the deal was not voluntary so Hungary would have to take in the 1300 even though they decided not to participate in the deal by giving the 54 000 but they just ignored the court ruling.

Thankfully a plastic surgeon came in and repaired it much less painfully, but it always seemed hypocritical that circumcision was singled out when babies are ""operated"" on without anesthetics by M.D.'s too.

NKAO was given autonomy by Stalin against the will of armenian and azerbaijani population of Karabakh. Before that, it was an integral part of Azerbaijan SSR (and Azerbaijan Democratic Republic before that). Thus Azerbaijan had right to revoke this autonomy (according to legislation of that time). There's nothing wrong there. 

Certainly Azerbaijan did wrong things in reaction (or overreacting) to separatist inclinations of some armenian nationalists. But it doesn't give Armenians a right to occupy neighbouring countries territories, and ethnically cleanse all azerbaijanis. There's no justification of what armenians did in Karabakh.

206,"1) People move. In America, this had led to an even greater geographical sorting into two ideological camps. It used to be that rural areas were more conservative than urban areas. But they used to have significant liberal/leftist presence. But now it is hyper partisan. Part of it is that the liberals in the rural areas all moved to the blue areas and vice versa, where conservative move to the suburbs. Segregation is a huge issue in the US, and the fact of the matter is that in cities, where lots of immigrants live, it is naturally going to be liberal-minded people who are going to live.

2) The nation-state is not local. The society/culture is not local. Despite the naive-minded views of some open-borders liberals about the end of the nation-state, people still care about their nation and still identify with that larger community. Also, in the age of TV, the internet, and social media, the idea that the changes in society can only be encountered by local interaction is false.

Unfortunately, all of the things we've talked about are the reasons why I think that the European project, in its current form at least, is probably headed for failure. Some big changes are needed and I can't see that there would be the consensus or the political will to enact them.

In my opinion the EU leadership needs to immediately stop criticising the legitimate, democratic decisions of voters in EU states. It entrenches the 'Us vs Them' mentality, and only gives anti-EU politicians further ammunition.

Secondly, I think the EU needs to be bold, and set out an inspiring, cohesive vision to improve the lives of all EU citizens. Nothing vague like a 'Pan-European working group consulting on ways to improve the educational engagement of 11-13 year old Gypsy-Roma boys', what's needed is something easy to understand, with a tangible benefit.

I'm no economist, so it's probably not viable, but imagine if the EU made a commitment to a Universal Basic Income for every established EU citizen. Even the most uneducated voter can understand, ""The EU wants to give me a considerable amount of money directly into my pocket.""

331,"It seems you would like me to defend and rationalize all the actions of the Swedish government. I've already made it clear that I disagree with the Swedish government on this issue, so why are you insising on bringing up the shortcomings of the Swedish government? We are in agreement there.

&gt;Just because other countries have enabled circumcision, doesn't mean Sweden is absolved of all responsibility.

I absolutely agree.

&gt;Swedish progressives have nothing to brag about it, for all the bragging they do otherwise.

What bragging?

&gt;Sweden doesn't have to be a role model, but it's representatives sure do act like they are.

Sweden gets a lot of things right, but that doesn't mean everything we do is perfect and above critizism. What is your point here, exactly?

&gt;Ideally, politicians should represent the will of the people. So why, when given statistics and polls that most people in those Scandinavian countries would like to see circumcision, do those politicians of those countries ignore those people

I haven't found any polls or statistics supporting this claim. During all my life here in Sweden, I don't think I've ever discussed the politics of circumcision with anyone in real life, simply because it is such a rare occurance and there are more important questions at hand. If you have a link to any poll I'd love to see it. Either way, it isn't an issue that has a lot of relevance at the moment, so I have to assume most people don't care enough to base their votes on this issue alone.

&gt;and why is it only the left-leaning parties that make excuses in favor of religion? 

[Here](https://affes.wordpress.com/2009/08/06/omskarelse-av-pojkar-hur-rostade-ditt-parti/) is a grapf showing what percentage of parties voted for the current legislation on circumcision. You'll notice that the environmental party (MP) were the only ones to vote against.

&gt;Religion is a touchy issue for politicians, understandably, but when they condescend to people about human rights, they are in no position to speak, but yet they do and they are not called out on their blatant hypocrisy. 

What du you wan't me to say? I have called them out, repeatedly. We agree here.

&gt;As for feminist politicians, I single them out because they are the ones who specifically focus on gender-related issues, thus they are expected to be publicly critical about these issues. 

It's an issue of equality, and, again, all prominent Swedish politicians are pro-equality. 

It's understandable that the focus is on women, but if those feminist politicians can talk about toxic masculinity and the issues around men not being able to express emotions, then why can't they take the time out to condemn circumcision publicly? 
Oh, we know why, it's because of political correctness.

Partly, sure. Mostly it's because people just don't care enough to make it into a prominent issue.

&gt;Your schools teach pro-feminist rhetoric 

Do you have some examples of this? 

&gt;and your newspapers generally don't allow criticisms of feminist rhetoric for that manner, 

What is this nonsense. [Here](https://www.svd.se/svensk-feminism-ar-inte-for-alla) is an article criticizing what the author sees as Swedish mainstream centre-left feminism. SvD Is one of the biggest newspapers in Sweden.

[Here](https://www.dagenssamhalle.se/kronika/svensk-feminism-tycks-varken-veta-ut-eller-20960) is another article.

[And here,](https://www.metro.se/artikel/k%C3%A4ra-vita-feminister-det-%C3%A4r-dags-att-ni-ser-fler-%C3%A4n-er-sj%C3%A4lva)

[And here.](https://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2017/05/01/analys-motverkar-den-moderna-feminismen-sitt-syfte)
All of these are critical of mainstream Swedish feminism.

&gt;Bengt Westerberg is a man and unless he's posturing the issue as a feminist one, you're just linking to an article of a Swedish man's opinion on circumcision.

I specifically chose Bengt because he has [described himself as a feminist.](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/10/world/europe/10iht-swedenside.html) (search for ""feminism"" and you'll find the quote.)

And that article was in 2011. Giving me links to articles that are mostly from years ago just proves how rusty the debate on circumcision is, that you can't even supply plentiful relevant contributions from politicians to recently.

[Here](http://www.dagen.se/sd-och-v-gjorde-gemensam-sak-mot-manlig-omskarelse-1.800393) is another article about local politicians in Jönköping from V and SD teaming up to stop funding for circumsicion, which ultimately didn't pass.

The claim you made that I was countering was that: ""None of your feminist politicians in Sweden have called for circumcision bans when they can."" which is obviously false, whether it happened in 2016, 2011 or 2001. 

&gt;The average Joe in my country aren't feminists.

Do you think anybody who advocates for equality is a feminist? I was asking specifically about equality, not feminism.

&gt;I'm specifically criticizing activists and politicians of the feminist nature, not people who go about their daily lives on average. I'm specifically talking about people who center themselves around issues of gender equality.

This would then include Swedish politicians on both sides of the spectrum, according to what you yourself wrote. Yet you still only blame the Swedish left for this issue. Why?

At this point I'm not even sure what we are arguing about anymore. We agree that Sweden (and the rest of the world) should ban minors from undergoing non-medical circumcision, right? ",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/8aogu9/mother_calls_for_ban_on_circumcision_a_woman_is/dx1im0z/,rutars,1523230857

If the EU is to be a success then *every* state needs to believe that their voice is being heard, that their concerns are taken seriously, and that the EU is working in their best interest.

And right now a lot of people don't believe that. The UK voted to leave, and if you re-ran that vote you'd find that very few people have changed their mind. In Eastern Europe it's possible to run on an openly anti EU platform and win. The FN in France posted its best results ever - if it wasn't for tactical voting they might well be in government.

Still recovering from last sessions failed defence of the Occident, we spent the first years [repaying our debt to the Jewish moneylenders](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/285115692095897601/432672102898728960/20180309231336_1.jpg). 

With great admiration did we see our friends proclaim the [Proud Nation of Spain](https://www.eldiario24.com/d24ar/fotos/uploads/editorial/2012/01/07/imagenes/4207_cristobal-colon-sifilis.jpg) and immediately declare on some heathen natives in the new world.

The Crimean Goths declared a war of aggression on our old crusade betrayer Naples, annexed the last city and then sold it to [The Papal states](https://i.imgur.com/JId1jfM.jpg). But not before his Holiness the Pope was briefly out of his mind and accepted a threaten war from Naples for Napoli. Now the Kingdom of Naples shall vanish in history like dust in the wind.

Another Italian adventure was dealing with the Duchy of Milan, which had gone from ally to going against us and was an annoyance to all Neighbours. Still frightened by the tales of the Milanese great military prowess, the Most Serene Republic of Venice, His Holiness and the Duke of Provence banded together and asked France for help, since the Habsburgs had allied Milan. Milan, being encircled from all sides, fell quickly but managed to rescue their army into Austrian lands. Austria, however, was busy fighting Bohemia and agreed to peace out, ceding Görz and Ragusa to the Republic of Venice, which now controls the Adria.

Then the truce with our old enemy, perfidious Albion, ran out. [Paris was merely a setback!](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/003/858/Kael.jpg) Their violation of the [Treaty of Tours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tours) had to be rectified. Luckily, the peace for them had been much worse than for us. They had turned away from God and accepted the heretic teachings of some Luther guy and God had punished him with rebels all over his Kingdom.

Not approving of the taking of French land, our mutual ally Burgundy posed an Ultimatum [(colourised)](http://www.artnet.com/WebServices/images/ll00188lldX09GFgBZqEfDrCWvaHBOcSzbE/arthur-david-mccormick-the-ultimatum.jpg) to cede the provinces, which England refused. That was one obstacle out of the way. Now the Ottomans had to be convinced to not defend England. For this, a bargain with the Crimean Goths of Theodoro, who wanted to retake land for their Danish vassal, was struck and they convinced the Sultan of the Mamluks, our (former?) enemy to join as well. Seeing this, the Turkish Caliph ended their alliance with England as well. 

Our dear Spanish friend, who always provides nice [wives](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Isabel_I_of_Castile.jpg/220px-Isabel_I_of_Castile.jpg) for my Kings, joined in as well and immediately blockaded the English ports.

The Bulk of the British navy was trapped. Rebels actually forced them to sail out of Harbour right into the waiting Spanish Armada, [a clear Victory for the Spanish](http://www.toptenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/trafalgar-naval-640x447.jpg) which showed the naval dominance of this thriving Kingdom. The outdated English navy proved to be a lot inferior. Seeing the English fleet forced to retreat into another blockaded harbour emboldened us to make several landings with transports, but we hadn't expected the English transports and trade fleet. The Mamluks navy saved the Theodoran transports and the French transports retreated into friendly harbours after losing 4 ships and all men on those ships. After the English army also lost to the [Theodoran vanguard](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430782166650060822/432598634102521857/unknown.png), seeing these overwhelming odds and still many rebels ravaging the countryside he asked for peace. We took all French lands, blessing them with French rule again and returned Lund and Sjaelland to Theodoro and their Danish vassal.

Then the Hansa crisis happened. The Duke of Burgundy was unsatisfied with The Republic of Lübeck sending money for protection to the Ottomans and threatened to declare war and call France and Spain in, without telling us beforehand. Having an army a quarter of the size of the Turkish and Spain busy fighting the Aztec Empire, we defused the situation and now Lübeck pays Burgundy and France. 

Speaking of money, thanks to everyone who contributed to the [French treasury](https://youtu.be/TeXatquVqAc). Gifts were received from Spain and Venice, subsidies from Lübeck and the Sultan of the Mamluks forgot he was still paying for fleet basing rights.

A new great invention has also emerged in... Europe... in Belozeero, new printing techniques have been discovered which greatly faciliates the propaganda machine. Sadly, this further spread the Protestant faith in Central Europe.

Now a great disaster looms over Europe: The heretics want to proclaim their false religion the one true faith! Already England has taken up the leadership of the Protestant league, while a battered Bohemia represents the one true faith of Catholicism. It may be time for someone else to lead the Catholic side, already the electors are voting for Mighty Iceland and Glorious France.",Deutschland,/r/europe/comments/8as9am/reurope_plays_europa_universalis_4_season_4_week/dx1jbuk/,chairswinger,1523231628

You don't pull out an infant's finger nails because you couldn't be arsed to cut them. 

You should also not cut off an infant's foreskin because you couldn't be arsed to clean it. And don't forget the foreskin remains naturally fused to the glans up til around the age of 6 give or take. So til then one does not require cleaning under the foreskin as it cannot be retracted. But once it has separated then one must start sliding it back to clean which is as easy as opening your eyelids.

Well, here are some facts about what you also likely are to experience in negative responses from women:
http://www.circumcision.org/femalesex.htm

""Circumcision Affects Female Sexual Pleasure
Female Ratings: Genitally Intact Men, 8.03     Circumcised Men, 1.81

Women who have only had sex with circumcised men may not know what they are missing. According to surveys in the medical literature, women reported that they were significantly more likely to have vaginal dryness during intercourse with circumcised men than genitally intact men. A medical journal survey of women who had comparative sexual experience included 138 responses. Other things being equal, on a scale of ten, they rated genitally intact men 8.03 and circumcised men 1.81. With circumcised partners, women were less likely to have one or multiple vaginal orgasms, and their circumcised partners were more likely to have a premature ejaculation. Circumcision was also connected with vaginal discomfort. Women were less likely to ""really get into it"" and more likely to ""want to get it over with"" if their partner was circumcised.

The results can be explained. The foreskin is a movable, double-layered sleeve. (See Functions of the Foreskin.) During intercourse, it glides up and down the penile shaft, reducing friction and retaining vaginal secretions. Without the foreskin, the skin on the penile shaft rubs against the vaginal wall, resulting in friction and increasing the need for artificial lubrication. The circumcised man has less sensitivity and requires deeper and harder thrusting to try to compensate, further increasing the friction.

With circumcised partners, surveyed women were more likely to feel unappreciated, distanced, disinterested, frustrated, and discontented. When their partners were not circumcised, women were more likely to feel intimate with their partners, relaxed, warmth, mutual satisfaction, and ""complete as a woman,"" and the greater sexual satisfaction benefited the relationship. To be clear, this does not mean that women cannot have a satisfying emotional and sexual relationship with a circumcised man. Other things being equal, it means that such a relationship may be likely to be even more satisfying if the man were not circumcised.""

I’ve done a study about this for a paper doing my masters degree in Poland (so by no means a professional study, just students and their laptops, but interesting results). My group checked various Neo-Nazi group videos (from bands like local Konkwista 88 or foreign No Remorse, Landser) and it seemed that 95 percent of the content was not blocked in Poland (which jas the 4th most strict laws om such issues after Germany, Austria and Israel). Landser famous for the anti-Polish song was most blocked. However weird other “Nazi” stuff was blocked, like the Epic Rap Battles of History Vader vs Hitler (only part one) for about 5 months until it was made available again. So if this is an automatic script it’s not working at all.

We all know how it is in Germany (and France etc):

- A LOT of native people don’t agree with the actions of the STATE OF ISRAEL, but thus has noting to do with antisemitism. A lot of people don’t agree with the actions of the governments of say Poland and Hungary now, despite them doing less controverial things. Disagreeimg with state/government actions in NOT antination/religion/culture

- There has been an increase in anti-Semitic violent attacks in Western Europe, but like with the old Holocaust survivor or the HyperKasher supermarket attack some time earlier, the perpetrators are NOT European natives. Sure, the governments are a bit to blame that they let violent radicals do such stuff, but no country can stop everyone. However saying that Germans of the French are anti-Semitic due to actions of people of different decent (who even if in 2-3 generation REFUSED to assymiliate) is another manipulation.

BTW: I’m not antiSemitic, not antiMuslim, not even anti multi-kulti much (though I see it was not done right), however I find no place for propaganda, especially the type of propaganda that calls someone a derogatory and underserved name. So sadly JPost is a propaganda rag for me.

It's not only the Eastern or Southern European countries that have an interest in keeping the ultimate authority within the nation states instead of moving it up to the EU and so limiting the mechanisms for EU rule enforcement. Basically always leaving the possibility of rejecting EU rules if they feel strongly about it.

For the smaller and less powerful countries no matter where they are located or how rich the fact that they might get overruled by the EU in the future may keep them from wanting to give the EU the ability to impose too forceful a punishment for anything. Bigger countries like Germany can be more secure in knowing they can never be fully overruled if they really put their foot down but even they will prefer to have the power remain with them rather than the EU.

561,"I disagree. 

The baby will be the one growing up with the results of the circumcision. Not the parents. 

So why should the parents have the right to surgically modify their child's genitals for religious reasons or appearance? 

You're stripping the child of the right to have their genitals remain as nature intended. You're forcing a decision on them that should not be forced on them because the reasons behind it cannot logically be justified. 

An adult can have it done to themselves and that is fine it is their decision. 

But to force a permanent change on a baby because ""God said so"" or because ""it looks better"" are not good enough reasons to do it.

You should also keep in mind babies have and continue to die from this procedure while not an excessive amount of deaths every year. The simple fact is that one child dying from an unnecessary circumcision is already one too many. 

And what happens if the procedure goes wrong? Because it can go wrong and has before many times where the cut is too tight or too deep causing severe issues and the most severe is the glans itself being accidentally removed which has happened. 

The parents can only blame themselves for putting their previously healthy newborn baby through an experience that has permanently altered their genitals for better or worse. And if the child dies it is even worse because no healthy child has died because he was uncircumcised.

I'm sorry, but I don't know how this entity can expect anything but open and vehement hostility from any Belorussians with any respect for themselves (idiots that joined the ""Pahonia"" unit are an exception to the rule, but, luckily, not a numerous one).

IDK, maybe for Russians it's not a big deal - after all Banderovtsy were really only active in Belarus and Western Ukraine against us and Poles, but to us, any sort of glorification of these pieces of shit is on the same exact level as support for SS and Hitler himself.

663,"The way I see it, the main issue with guessing/assuming the motive behind an attack is that it leads to severly biased thinking, _unless_ you are immune to confirmation bias, _and_ you keep up to date with news to hear who actually did it.

Otherwise you end up with:

0. Crime happens.
1. Assume group X did it.
2. Since group X did it, there is now more evidence in your mind that group X commits crimes of this type
3. Crime happens
4. Assume group X did it. This is supported by the ""evidence"" you have collected in the previous steps. This makes your belief that group X is behind these kind of crimes stronger.
5. Goto 4.

As you see, this leads to more and more ""evidence"" that group X does these things, despite not _actually_ introducing any evidence.

Now, you might say that if you see in the news later who did it, then that will remove the faulty evidence from your mind. However, confirmation bias tells us that we easily ignore evidence that is not in line with out beliefs. Since you already believe that group X commits these crimes (backed by your ""evidence"") you are likely to ignore any information that contradicts you. And of course, this is assuming you read follow up stories at all (for some reason, certain forums are less likely to post follow ups when it turns out that group X was not guilty after all).",,/r/europe/comments/8aq69x/german_police_arrest_man_suspected_of_terror_plot/dx0xa0x/,redderoo,1523209294

692,"&gt;Because in the UK, and elsewhere, most unnecessary circumcisions are religious and cultural in nature. If you make exceptions, then a ban become redundant. European countries don't generally promote circumcision for medical reasons, so the only people to target are those who do it for religious purposes.

As long as your ban doesn't contain specific references to specific cultures or religions, but just bans non-medical circumcision in general, I'll support it wholeheartedly. Anyone claiming that such a law targets any specific religion has missed the point of having a secular society.

&gt;Even your Swedish politicians are guilty of this. 

I haven't really seen this mentioned a lot in Sweden but I'd be happy if you could link me to any Swedish politician opposing this.

748,"Male and female circumcision are not remotely the same thing.  Male: remove some of the foreskin.  Female: remove the clitoris.  That's like comparing getting your ear pierced to getting both ears cut off and sewing the canals shut.  

Male circumcision has some health benefits.  The penis is generally cleaner and less prone to infections when circumcised (these are documented facts). Yes, a boy's penis hurts while it's healing, but when done that young, there is absolutely no memory of it because you can't lay down memories that young. You can convince me of pros and cons of the procedure.  It should be the parent's choice.

Female circumcision is outright mutilation to remove the ability to enjoy sex.  They do it to keep a woman from cheating, which works because if she doesn't enjoy fucking, she's probably not going to leave you to fuck someone else.  It's a crime against humanity.

This is not an isolated issue and happens regularly for at least a year or longer. Our policy on speculation and the classic one-liners isn't an exactly new one either, we're merely taking this opportunity to point out *why* it is in place.

Shortly after I joined the mod team [this knife attack](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/77mm9u/one_dead_eight_injured_in_a_knife_attack_in_poland/) in Poland happened with one dead and six injured. No one really gave a fuck, apart from a couple reports regarding our local crime rule. Reasonable thread all in all.

The day after [this knife attack](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/77saq2/munich_attack_police_launch_manhunt_for_knifeman/) happened in Germany with four people injured.

The difference in media attention *and* both the quantity and type of engagement on /r/europe is absolutely insane.

As for the EuropeMeta thread, mistakes can and will happen - even more so during times at which we have to handle loads of volume.

Sure there are more painless circumcisions. If they're done in a hospital and sterile conditions. But the same could be said about FGM if it was performed by a doctor in a hospital. And yes, luckily not that many boys get a trauma or mental damage from it. But even that is a number that can only be guessed. Keep in mind that most of those men grow up in conservative and religious surroundings, where it's often a taboo for men to talk about their weaknesses, fears and pains. 
So how do you get to the conclusion that it wouldn't mentally scar anyone?

Even if the number of males that are hurt or traumatized is lower, than with females, it still is a number of people that are damaged for their life. And there is no sane reason to say that one is not as grusome as the other one, just because it has a different group of victims.

910,"Tradition innovation and Europe. Because in the old dairy founded 64 years ago in Dolianova, in the countryside of the Campidano, in the province of Cagliari, by the Argiolas brothers Ennio and Eligio, travels between traditional recipes, experimentation and technology. And uses that financial gift made available, project after project, by the european institutions. Looking towards the future but with a foot still planted in the solid past. The resti s a constant work in order to “try to keep up with the times”. From the search for new markets to the experimentation of niche products, with technology that makes modern an agri-food company.

 “we always tried to keep up with the times – says Vittorio Tomasiello, responsable for administration, informatic systems and european projects – from the early 00’s, when we began to work with european calls we have completed projects and fundings for tens of million of euros”. An opportunity that the company (40 direct employees and 20 seasonal employees) has immediatly used. “indeed, we have to remember that in the early 00’s the fundings, channeld through the *Por Sardegna*, were 50 % non-repayable because our region was still outside of Objective 1”. The first important step was the construction of a warehouse for the “realisation of a new productive process inside of the company with consequent improvment of product packaging and then the marketing for brand recongnition”. In between there is also the programme that has brought technology and robotics inside of the processing process, the innovation programme that started almost 18 years ago.

 “We use the 4.2 mesaureof the programme for rural development 2014-2020, year 2016 – explains Tomasiello-. An instrument that we used to start that [robotisation process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T38v3-SSGcM&amp;list=RDT38v3-SSGcM) that involves the final part of the packaging process of the products”. Without forgetting the most recent initiative: the buying of a pallet maker, which is a mechanical arm that makes pallets by taking the cartons and implanting them. And then there’s the energy: “we realised a photvoltaic facility for self-production - says Tomasiello – with 176 kw that we fully utilised to cover the company’s need covering 10% of the total [energy need]”. An intervention “for 600 thousand euros with the help of the Psr funded for 20%”. The past and the present, but especcialy, niche products for the company which makes 17 million euros, and a yearly production of 2 million kilos of cheese and a processing of 12 million liters of milk (10 million of sheep milk, 1,5 of goat, and a little under 400 thousands of cow).

 “in the regional market we make 6% of the earnings – he continues – the 18% goes to non-italian markets (Japan, North America, Israel and Russia) while the rest goes to northern and central Italy, we also have a distribution center in Monteveglio in the province of Bologna” the technological breakthrough, with the new systems its possible to make 3.500 cheeses in a day, involve salso the managment of the whole company: “we equpped with a new business intelligence system that takes the data from the managment, analizes them and saves them in the cloud garanteeing a daily controll of the company also garanteeing a comparison with the past” for the thirs mangerial generation marketing also became crucial and fundemental. It is not a coincidence that the company, that in the years has tried to diversify her production by introducing a series of niche products, has decided to bet on communication and marketing. “i would say that for this sector it is foundamental – says Alessandra Argiolas, responsable for marketing and president of *Confindustria Giovani* - it is important too find new alternative comunication methods going beyond the price. Naturally it goes without sayng that without tradition there can’t be any innovation”.

Of course parents can still brainwash them but that's true for anything. E.g. you can also constantly give your child unhealthy food but we still have rule that e.g. schools should provide healthy food. There is just a ridiculous double standard when it comes to religion.

Well, it's complicated since many protests also involve preventing the law enforcement from doing their job (think about ""Stop Desahucios"", which might not be the best example but you get my point).

There's also the matter of whether the separatist leaders were responsible of this moves because they were organized mostly by private citizens (although it can be argued that as leaders of the cause and due to their calls to disobedience they can be accused of the crime). Sedition is very controversial, even amongst judicial experts.

What do you know about Soviet history? Do you have any arguments other than the ""fool""? The first meeting of the Central Committee on October 10, 1917 consisted of 7 people. At this meeting, was decided to start a coup, which later will be known as the October Revolution. Only 2 of them were Russian: Bubnov (Ru), Zinoviev (Jew), Kamenev (Jew), Lenin(Ru), Sokolnikov(Jew), Stalin(Georgian)).

Because there were only 2 large cities in the country that were not destroyed by the war, and Peterburg was in 30 kilometers from the Finnish border?

Yes, China has different values, but that doesn't mean 2 superpowers on the global stage is a bad thing all the way. It creates some sort of balance and, like it or not, a lot of countries don't like (or even hate) it right now that the US is the only superpower in the world. That, in some way, is a dictatorship of its own. Besides that, I really doubt that China will promote their dictatorship on a global level. Countries in the region should worry about it, but the Western world not so much.

I wouldn't call Europe, or more precise the EU, (completely) irrelevant. It's not a superpower, and it won't be on the short term. But it *does* have (some) political power, especially in the region *and* it is one of the biggest economic powers in the world as well; it's a regional power that acts on the international stage.

I hope so, too, cause right now, most of those values we cherish so much, are under threat and even under attack in the US. Trump might also be the first in a series of populist presidents like him. I hope not, but it could be. The next one (or the one after the next one) could be even worse. And if that's the case the EU *will* need to step up sooner or later, whether it likes it or not.

1298,"&gt; The PNVD sought to have the legal age of consent lowered to 12, and, in the long run, completely eliminated (except in dependent or intrafamilial relationships).

Well this part of the long run isn't sourced and I couldn't find it in their party programme unlike the 12 one so I'm going to say this is just a myth someone added to wikipedia.

&gt; But that is not what age of consent means though.

It means many things; in the end ""age of consent"" is an English term that has no Dutch translation; the Dutch system is different from the English/American system of a single age and there are two ages. These are typically translated as ""conditional"" and ""absolute"" age of consent.

This is similar to what some English countries do where they have Romeo-and-Juliet age brackets like ""no more than 2 years apart from the ages of 12-15 and from 16 on absolute"".

&gt; Right. All you are saying is that age of consent is not 12.

I never said the age of consent was 12. I've said three times now already the absolute age of consent is 16 and the conditional one 12 and yet you keep talking to mea s if I said the ""age of consent"" which is a term I never used without qualifying it with ""absolute"" and ""conditional"" is 12.",Je kon de macht der goden hebben!,/r/europe/comments/8ajwjf/partij_islam_wants_islamic_state_in_belgium/dx07iau/,Kringspier_Des_Heren,1523167745

1312,"Yeah I've never really understood the mindset of some people that both sides are equal.

Keep in mind muslims make only about 10% of the population for most of the countries that have had problems with terrorist attacks.

In 2016 there were overall 37 terrorist attacks in the EU, some were lethal, some weren't.

- 27 of them were done by muslim extremists.

- 5 of them were definitely done by right-wing terrorists, 2 in Northern-Ireland, 1 in the Netherlands, 1 in Gothenburg, 1 in Munich and then there were 2 in Hungary and Germany, where it is suspected that they were right-wing motivated.

- 3 of them were done by anarchists

3 deadliest attacks were all done by muslim extremists, Nice 86 dead, Brussels 35 dead and 12 in Berlin. 

The 4th deadliest was the 2016 shooting in Munich, which was ironically done by a second-generation immigrant with asulym seeker parents from Iran who were Shia muslims themselves.

But given that he was mostly nonreligious, he was born and raised in Germany and he was sympathetic towards Andrei Breivik, I counted it as right-wing.

So it is quite impressive that 8-10% of the population is behind so many of the attacks. 

Which is the question I always ask, when the next terrorist attack hits the news and the prepatator is unknown, would you bet your money on the 90% of the population committing it or the 10%? 

Of course things weren't always like this. In the 70's and 80's my money would've been on the IRA. In the first half of the 20st century it would've been on the communists. 

I don't like speculating about the motives during the attacks, it makes you look stupid when you're wrong. Besides, its irrelevant for the time being. Political debates can happen later on. 

But you know, the accusations of racism for thinking that there is a higher chance that it's a muslim is ridiciluous. It's a statistical fact.

At least in the Netherlands apparently Muslims are secularising at a higher rate than the Christians as in the child of two Muslim parents is more likely to drop the religion than the child of two Christian parents but that might also be because NL knows a lot of atheist Christians who are basically only Christian in the sense that they think hanging out in Church for the enjoyment of it is a fun activity.

TBH my opinion doesn't actually stem from the terrorism problem, although that obviously adds urgency. It's from a series of studies - first one being [Bowling Alone](https://www.saddleback.edu/faculty/agordon/documents/Bowling_Alone.pdf), and the second one being [E Pluribus Unum](http://www.aimlessgromar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/j-1467-9477-2007-00176-x.pdf) (although I can add about 50 more studies backing up the latter's conclusions). The tl;dr is that high social trust leads to high social capital, which is essential for a country to function well. The second study found that diversity destroys social trust (among a bunch of other things, like population density, crime, not speaking the language, etc.). Simply put, the more diverse a country becomes, the less functional it becomes. As European countries become more diverse, they will become more corrupt, divided, nepotistic and violent. They will look more like Brazil, Syria, Yugoslavia, Mississippi or the Congo. In the end, GDP may have gone up from the immigration but no one will really benefit.

1454,"El Valle de los Caidos represents now the fanatism and fear fascism imposed in Spain. That is what it represents for me and what it means to many people. People go there to see how it was. There was slave labour in that place and many horrors that we know now. I am pretty sure that if families ask it the corpse of the person they want out of there can be moved. If moving Franco's corpse can be discussed then that can be done.

Fascism glorification? I never *ever* glorified it. I simply consider it a dark age we should never repeat. I disregard the opinion of a fascist the same way I disregard the opinion of a nazi or a stalinist. They are not even worth considering.

The Transition was done pretty well. You see, I do not know if you wanted another Civil War just to settle the score but many people supported Franco back then. Many sectors in the *army* did. It was better to have a peaceful transition than starting witch hunts and ending god knows how.

I highly doubt there is anyone left to judge. If there is I do not mind it. I do have the feeling it would not be done for the victims or families of the victims though.

Last time I checked those streets were being changed. So it is kind of happening already. The issue is that the parties doing it have no criteria and all and funnily enough names like Salvador Dalí or even the *Catholic Kings* have been discussed. So it would be better if they took it seriously instead of doing it for votewhoring.

As I said, I condemn fascism. I despise Franco and I have nothing to do with it. The issue is that we have used these 40 years of democracy only to blame each other for the previous 40 of dictatorship. Its enough. 

We have reached a point where left-wing people are being called fascists just because they do not abide to nationalism. That is just a ridiculous irony.

no one offers you anything unless you look for it. there goes the passive part. and you can also say no to any offer made to you. especially if its some shady and illegal stuff. and if you dont know that its illegal, well then thats on you. informing yourself is easy. so is telling apart legal work from illegal.

1797,"&gt;Not in Europe. Obviously most muslims live among other muslims in the middle east and elsewhere so obviously that's were most islamic terrorism incidents and casualties are but it's an irrelevant fact in the current conversation.

So what you're saying is that the terrorists attack Muslims in Islamic states because they want to bring about an Islamic State? Top level logic right here.

&gt;Those are not mutually exclusive. Why don't you ask them what their motivation is? Because they're quite explicit it's because of their religious beliefs. They're not trying to hide it either.

A great Frankie Boyle quote:

""People that have sex with their pets say they're motivated by love, but most of us don't really believe them""

You'd be a fool to think their extremism is an accepted Islamic belief in anywhere but the most extreme parts of the Middle East \+ South Asia

&gt;Neither do most people holding far\-right tendencies. Yet we have no problem recognizing that as a dangerous ideology.

Nice. So not only are you defending Nazism, you're also completely ignoring the fact that all Nazis DO want an ethnically ""pure"" nation. That HAS to come by force, there's just no other way. Whether a Nazi would kill a Jew or not does not negate the fact that he wishes the Jews were either dead or not in his country.

The majority of Muslims in Western Europe do not want their countries to be Islamic, they are not here to spread ethnic division. This is an amazing double standard.

&gt;To the contrary. Look at Poland, the Baltics, Ireland, even Iceland. Where there aren't many muslims there isn't much islamic terrorism. Even 60 years ago when the muslim population of Europe \(northeast of the Balkans anyway\) was tiny islamic terrorism was unheard of.

I simply cannot fathom how you can pick out Ireland as a nation that has historically had low levels of terrorism. You REALLY do not have a clue what you're talking about do you?

1818,"The thing is, our countries aren't filled with terrorists. The people involved in **all** Islamic terrorism attacks in Europe amount to, at most, a couple of hundred people. Out of 44 million(19 million in the EU). 

There were more active Communist terrorists in Europe back in the 70s and 80s. ETA alone is responsible for over 3,000 attacks, over 2,000 injured, and 829 dead. The Troubles in Ireland caused 1800+ deaths and tens of thousands of injured.

Even if the amount of people involved in Islamic terrorism numbered in the thousands, it wouldn't even be close to 1% of the Muslim population of the EU(That's 19m, not 44m).

If we started blaming peoples for what less than 1% of them are involved in, we'd have to completely empty Europe of people.

As cold as it may sound, this is a fad. There were some successful vehicle ramming attacks, and that lead to more attempts. Vehicle rammings increased in ""popularity"" across the board, not just with Muslim terrorists.

It's the same thing that happened after 9/11. Everyone wanted to pull off some grand coordinated attack on major public areas like the 7/7 attacks in London and 11/M in Madrid.

It's just that right now, the people behind the most successful terrorist attacks are Muslim. This means that people with a Muslim background are more likely to be inspired by them.

It was the same cycle with Communist terrorism, Separatist terrorism, and so on. Would throwing out every single Muslim from Europe reduce terrorist attacks? Probably. Would rounding up every Basque in Spain reduce terrorist attacks? Probably. But beyond being a practical impossibility, we didn't do that because the problem wasn't Basque people, and it isn't Muslim people.

Here's the thing: If a mentally unbalanced white guy gets cheated on by his girlfriend, he doesn't have some sinister organization to join to give him an outlet for his craziness, so he just takes a knife and stabs his girlfriend and the dude she's cheating on him with to death. If a mentally unbalanced Muslim dude gets rejected by a bunch of white girls, he goes on some ISIS forums, watches ISIS propaganda on Liveleak, takes a knife and goes out on the streets stabbing people while yelling ""Allahu Ackbar!""

0:21 János Lázár. Former leader of the Fidesz parliamentary group and current Minister of Prime Minister's Office.
 
0:37 Zsolt Semjén. Currently minister without portfolio and Deputy Prime Minister. Known for his luxury hunt trips in Sweden.

0:41 Tímea Vajna. Wife of Andrew G. Vajna, a Hungarian-American film producer. The guy is 75 and she's 35.

0:46 Felcsúti Kisvasút (Vál Valley Light Railway). The building of the line was supported by the European Union, who have since launched an OLAF investigation into the funding. Orbán has been accused of misusing €2M of EU money contributed to the construction of the railway. The funding request was based on 2,500 passengers using the line daily. The true ridership is one thousandth of this, and the village of Felcsút only has a population of 1,812.

0:47 The man himself, standing in the newly built stadium in Felcsút. This is the town where Orbán spent his chilhood. In 2009 Felcsút became the richest Hungarian settlement by capita (171 092 HUF), pushing 2nd and 12th district of Budapest to the 2nd and 3rd place. In 2008 Felcsút was standing in the 336th place. The development of Felcsút is a pet project of the prime minister Viktor Orbán. During Orbán's tenure as PM, several building projects were initiated or completed in the village, including Pancho Arena, a football stadium next to a property owned by Orbán, which was built in 2014 (the stadium has 3,900 seats, which is more than double of Felcsút's population), and a narrow-gauge railway line, planned to be completed by 2019. In early 2014 plans of construction of a new airport were reported, these rumors turned out to be false, as the building permit posted on the local government's website is of an earlier date and refers to an already existing airport, owned by Péter Besenyei.

0:56 Lőrinc Mészáros. The fifth richest person in Hungary, also the mayor of Felcsút. 

0:57 Árpád Habony. Longtime unofficial advisor to Viktor Orbán. He has been referred to as the ""unacknowledged spin doctor"" of Orbán, but his exact position is not formally stated. He and the late Arthur J. Finkelstein were shareholders in ""Danube Business Consulting Ltd.""

1965,"&gt; Point me to some third party publications of the time like I pointed you to Horton's book or Henry Morgenthau's calls for checks on Turkey.

Why? The saving-christians rhetoric of the time prevented the reports and memoirs from becoming big issues, I can refer you to those if you'd like.

&gt; Scorched earth tactics only happen in retreat because there is no reason to burn something you want to establish as your own to the ground. I love how you highlighted it too.

So you're saying the fire in İzmir was started by Greeks?

What a silly suggestion. The Greek army did not advance for conquest, it advanced to put down the Turkish national movement. It wished to exact revenge for perceived injustices while it was there. Like in Yalova.

&gt; I am not an expert of Armenian history like I am on Greek but I if you can please point me to some reading on this.

Unfortunately there is no comprehensive or easy to read text I know of, focusing on the east and Armenians within the Russian and Turkish empires along with their political movements. You could take a look at the Armenian-Azeri mess in 1905, the individuals and groups collaborating with Russia in WW1 and ofc Ottoman records both pre and post CUP on rebel activity.

&gt; Wow. You actually haven't read much on the Greek Revolution, eh? The Filiki Etairia quest was a quest about securing the Christian freedom. It wasn't even purely ethnic. Slavs like Djordje Petrovic were also part of it. And not only that. You can read on Kolokotronis' memoir about talks about establishing a state together with Muslim Albanians. Ethnic nationalism was never a thing in Greece.

Christian in this instance was a useful label for Greeks, given how their church was still in charge of the rest of the Balkan nations. Regardless, ethnic nationalism did reach Greece. Greece desired and carried out multiple population exchanges along ethnic lines (despite the practical construction being based on religion) and the Greek state maintains an ethnic and religious core identity fixed in law today.

2012,"&gt; Western world does care a bit about the Caucasus by the way, like Georgia. For the other two Trans-Caucasus countries, it's the Russian sphere so they don't care that much for sure.

The care you see is strategic: energy projects and containing Russia and similar stuff. Everything else you see mentioned a lot around for example about Georgia and Ukraine is just propaganda to create a semblance of ""West is interested in the East/South Caucasus"". Russian propaganda attempting to destabilise everything doesn't help either. 

The EU's attempts for example to pierce into the Russian sphere of influence in the South Caucasus is interesting for sure as is the latest agreement with Armenia and the previous one with Georgia, and yet many see this as strategic moves by the EU and the west. As a pro-EU I do welcome all of this but I do question how it will all end up like. My take is that there is an active interest in containing the EU as well and the border of this containment just happens to also cross the South Caucasus. That also explains the fierce battle for mind share in Georgia and Armenia.

But we're agreed that to cause harm you need to come in contact with it right?

&gt;By evaporation. Do you have chemistry in your schools? You know, if you leave a glass of water, sooner or later water from it would evaporate into the atmosphere and tiny particles of water would fly in the air as a consequence.

&gt;They shouldn't be taken into a lab of a country which could be involved in poisoning

I agree! So they shouldn't have ended up in Russia!

Happily the UK isn't involved in the poisoning so that isn't an issue.

&gt;don't you understand it? Like killers have taken a knife to their lair to clean it of fingerprints. Do you understand me? UK is not a neutral side in this case, it is a suspect and it destroys pieces of evidence, one after another.

No, the UK is the victim, and the country in which the attack occurred. I don't think you quite get it.  

The UK has satisfied itself, its allies and other countries of what happened and who is behind it. It doesn't have to prove it beyond reasonable doubt, it doesn't have to share data with Russia, it doesn't have to prove what it believes is true in court. The UK just has to be convinced that it's intelligence and analysis is right and be able to convince its allies of the same.

Russia can whine and whinge as much as it likes. At the moment though, it seems that Russia was behind this attack (and others previously..) and the UK seems quite able to show that. 

The UK doesn't need to convince Russia, at least partially because Russia likely already knows what happened, the UK doesn't need to listen to obfuscation, misdirection, disinformation or lies from the Russian government, it doesn't have to satisfy Russia's conditions. 

The UK can, has and will continue to act on the basis of the evidence it has, and on the basis of the conclusions it has reached.  And it's allies will likely to the same, because frankly it makes sense, even just looking at what is public, and Russia's claims and counterclaims so far have very little credibility indeed (and are now devolving into absurd conspiracy theories about the UK being behind the attack..).",Royaume-Uni de Grande-Bretagne et d'Irlande du Nord,/r/europe/comments/8a96px/exspy_improving_rapidly_after_poisoning/dwyrvf4/,ajehals,1523108378

Stara Pavlica (Serbian Cyrillic: Стара Павлица) is a medieval Serbian Orthodox monastery located in Pavlica, Raška, in south Serbia on a rocky plateau above the Ibar River, six kilometres north of the town of Raška. 

It is assumed to originate in the pre-Nemanjić Dynasty at the end of the 11th century. The monastery is first mentioned in the charter of King Stefan the First Crowned, and parts of the church were restored during the 1970s.

The monastery church is dedicated to the holy Apostles Peter and Paul.

2062,"&gt; If you admire something that wants to kill you and that says your ideas are bs then you probably don't really know it or have a secret motive.

Are you really saying that all Muslims want to kill all non Muslims? 

&gt;Hitler's many ideas contradict with Islam which also means that it doesn't have much place in Islamic culture.

That's not what we are talking about. I didn't say Hitler was an Islamist. I didn't say Hitler was a Muslim. I didn't say Muslims are Nazis. All I said is that Hitler had a certain stance towards Islam and pursued closer ties with Muslim nations. Judeochristianity was perceived to be for the weak. 

&gt;I live in a majority Muslim country.You can also check Neo-Nazi (or nationalists groups at start) groups in the Arab world.

Even if this is not data I'll take it. And I'll say this. Modern neo-nazis having an anti-islamic sentiment means that original national socialists had that same sentiment too?

2082,"Do you know Iran attempted to politically take over Azerbaijan right? Do you think had that been successful it would back the Armenian side or help resolve the conflict if it were allowed by the other regional powers?

What I have been saying and I stand by my words is that all these regional powers have mingled in the region to take a piece of the pie for themselves and control it. They all at some point backed Azerbaijan and also Armenia, I would even dare say Turkey at some point could have backed Armenia. Even now some think Armenia and Azerbaijan are clearly aligned with their regional counterparts and I do question this. Prior to April 2016 war Azerbaijan employed fiercely anti-Iranian rhetorics and the war *was stopped by a meeting between Iran, Russia and Azerbaijan* after which Azerbaijan's rhetoric against Iran simply stopped, softened up and even improved. First, things are not like how they look like most of the time, and second supposed alliances can suddenly stop being so.

In any case the point is that the Karabakh war was won by the Armenian side, with the key point being that Karabakh itself is a natural fortress as well as the Soviet cache of weapons it contained. Support by Armenians from outside Armenia of course was a factor as well as well as foreign mercenaries which helped both sides. The story you can hear from elders in Armenia and specially in Karabakh is that it was the Russians with tanks which stopped the Armenians proceeding further in 1994  for a ""decisive victory"". Russia is not exactly popular within the Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh. Russia does not want a war in the region, but it doesn't want to resolve the conflict either. Others have similar ideas.

2152,"&gt;You base this on nothing.

I do.As i said he liked some of ideas of Muslims and Islam and wanted to exploit the weaknesses of Allies by cooperating with Muslims but making him sound like Islam fanboy #1 and making it seem like he obeyed Islamic rules is wrong.

Many of his ideas are litterarly opposite of Islamic views and him saying ""i like Islam"" doesn't change that.For example:

- He is not Muslims which makes him litterarly killable by some sects.

- He is literally racist which is hated in Islam.

- He saw many majority Muslim nations as inferior race.

- He loves dogs which is prohibited in some sects.

- Treatment of captured enemies and other people.

- Muhammed didn't like keeping slaves and tried to prevent it but didn't ban it.Hitler made millions slaves.

- Useage of drugs.

- In many Islamic sects he and every other German would have never been the leader Islamic world(Khalifa).

Etc.

Some other important side notes:

Neo-Nazis living in majority Muslim countries usually dislike/hate Islam and Islamist and it is vice versa.They have much more diffrences than commons.

And not only Croatian families, but Serb, German, Czech, Hungarian and Jewish families equally. But I'm not surprised that the first thing you do, when you are confronted with criticism is to assume that your discussion partner must be a fascist. That is exactly what your educational system conditioned you to do. You are probably one of those guys who attacks people as FPO voters, when you don't like their arguments, but are a Green party voter yourself and are too blind to see that it's the opposite site of the same coin. 


&gt;You can criticize aspects of Yugoslavia without going full retard.


Now that is an interesting argument. Would you apply it to NAZI Germany or the Soviet Union  too? Lets see, what are the most common arguments for Tito: 


1. He secured the peace in Yugoslavia for 45 years. So did the communists in the USSR and the NAZIS in their occupied territotries like Austria. Both also used the same tactics, mass incarceration, show trails, execution of the political opposition and dispossession of private property. Once you make the population fear you, it's not difficult to secure peace.


2. Economy. An argument, which was disproven a million times. In fact it was Tito who allowed the ""red"" managers to rob public companies like INA for decades, took up foul credits and was directly responsible for the economic crisis of the 80s and the ultrainflation. Also I think people would get ridiculed if they used the same arguments for Stalin or Hitler (aka, ""Well at least Hitler built the Autobahn"" ""Well at least Stalin accelerated the transition to an industrialized economy""; I don't recall the japanese killing millions of their own people during their transition to an industrialized country, neither did the British or the French). And just fyi, all those nasty Croatian and Serbian Gastarbeiter, who left their homes in the 70s to go work in Germany and Austria, did so, not because they wanted to, but because the economy in Yugoslavia was so bad, that Tito directed people to leave the country and come back with money. Moreover the economy was one of the weakest in all of europe, despite other countries being bombed to pieces or having an equally bad start. The GDP per capita was even worse than that of Romania under the the communists. 


3. He was a statesman. Well so are many of the politicians of today and the past. Bush, Blair, Sarkozy were all statesmen. They are tolareted, but only for as long as they play along.

2320,"Well, raising animals for meat is a pretty efficient process, they don't live very long and the feedstock if often not usable for humans. For example, cows and sheep eat hay, grass and silage (fermented hay and grass). Not all land is suitable for grain and potatoes (nutrients, acidity, water levels etc.), so we may just as well use the land for meadows and collect the hay. Meadows generally don't require much herbicides, pesticides and fertiliser. Clover, which is planted on meadows fixes nitrogen from the air using symbiotic bacteria. You could  plant clover one year, collect it as an animal fodder, and say plant barley the next year. But you are still left with the clover. Humans don't eat clover. What are you going to do with it? Besides, meadows play an important role in maintaining biodiversity because they provide flowers for bees (like the said clover), living space for insects, rodents, if wet amphibians, birds feeding on the insects - larks, falcons, cranes etc. 

Pigs are a different thing - they can eat pretty much everything - vegetables, potatoes, grains, legumes, they won't say no to meat. They do compete with humans for food. They are however cheap, because they grow quickly. They can eat leftovers, which was a common feed for pigs in the past.

Farming is really way more complicated than saying eat less meat. Also, veggie burgers are more expensive because they are are made with high-protein meat substitutes. Instead of a fancy shmancy fungus derived engineered veggie burger get a falafel next time.

2337,"&gt; Is being pro-EU being anti-Russia? If so, why is it so bad that Ukrainians are pro-EU? Should they not be?

Being pro-EU is not necessarily anti-Russia, but in Ukraine it was that. 

&gt;And no, the West did not meddle in Ukraine. Ukrainians did that themselves. 

The West most definitely influenced Ukraine and supported the revolutionary forces. That had happened ever since they got independent. Obviously the pro-Russia government and its bad politics played a major role as well.

&gt;You are trying to delegitimize the revolution by Ukrainians by framing them as ""anti-Russia"" because they are pro-EU and ousted a leader who lied to them about getting closer to EU and instead got closer to Russia.

Because it was an illegal coup that ousted the legal Ukrainian government. If a nationalist coup would happen in Germany partially because of Russian influence, our approach would be very different, even if that was really what Germans wanted...  Being pro-EU is just fine, but the issue here is that the coup was also riddled with anti-Russia sentiment and many Ukrainian neonazis and ultranationalists got into power in Ukraine. Ukraine went from one extreme to another. They went from pro-Russia to anti-Russia. And as we saw, that led to separatism in Eastern Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea... 

&gt;If Ukrainians want their future to align with EU instead of Russia, they are free to do that. They have no obligation to be pro-Russian.

But Ukrainians are not just one collective body making decisions. There just happened to be enough of them to oust the government. Some because they thought their government is shit, some because they wanted a nationalist revolution, some because they were influenced by the West, some because of peer pressure. 

The reality is that Ukraine has always been a divided country... There has always been the Ukrainian speaking West that has felt that Russia/USSR has oppressed them and want to get away from its influence. Then there is the Eastern part of Ukraine (Crimea included) that is largely Russian speaking and consider themselves part of the Russian cultural sphere. 

The separatism in Eastern Ukraine didn't come out of thin air either... Ukrainians really did oppose their new government and rose up. Russia took advantage of this and heavily supported them. 

The thing what I'm after with these comments is that Ukraine doesn't have to forever submit to Russia, but they should acknowledge their geopolitical situation and act accordingly. Their freedom will ALWAYS be limited thanks to neighboring a former superpower. That's just how it is, no matter whether they like it or not... In that situation, openly aspiring to join NATO and turning against Russia is NOT the wise thing to do. Ukraine should balance between Russia and the West. If their people want to get closer with the West, it shouldn't be denied like Yanukovych did, but they should do it with caution and in a way that it doesn't immediately conflict with the Russia interests in the region.

2392,"It's changing. Russian is becoming more popular, in part because more schools have the resources to offer it. 

My younger brother took part in a programme where Russian was introduced from early grades, together with English (so a couple of years before Swedish starts). It's a fairly rural town with a small population, yet they had that (didn't have it when I went to school but now they do), so it shows that at least in Eastern Finland, resources are assigned to this. I'm pretty sure I would've taken at least some Russian if it had been an option. (I learned a bit of German and French instead, but remember very little of either, unfortunately.)

The statistics might be warped either by including native Russian speakers (including bilingual children from immigrant families or families where one parent is an immigrant, or children adopted from Russia), or by not including native speakers when perhaps you should. I don't know which way the statistics lean, but this might be a factor.

Russian might be popular because of proximity or because of its connection to the Orthodox Christian minority, but a more important reason probably is that it's spoken by so many people and in a nation that trades a lot with us, so it's an important language in business, especially in Eastern Finland. (We have a lot of Russian tourists, as well.) German is still viewed as the second most valuable language for business after English, but Russian is also important. (I'd argue we should do more with Spanish, French, Arabic, Chinese, and maybe Japanese - and I know Japanese is quite popular in the rare cases where it's available prior to university level.)",Finland,/r/europe/comments/8abdwv/most_studied_foreign_language_apart_from_english/dwyicw1/,bo-tvt,1523087661

2396,"Mostly I think US companies don't understand EU isn't USA or rather they are trying to make EU act like USA. Many European 'competitors' to Americans don't appear, because Europeans companies know *this business model just won't fly here*. Which leads to many US companies established and grown to massive size in USA arriving to Europe and then getting slapped by regulators.

It isn't that EU is against American big tech companies as specific. Rather often said companies employ *business models* EU has issue with. As said that just doesn't come up with European company, since no European company would be employing *business model x*, since that isn't culturally or regulatorily viable in Europe. Internet bleeds the national borders,  so American business models bleed to Europe.  Then when they get established enough to have presence in Europe, regulator pounces on that *business model* or *business practice*.

Which then leads to the age old *You want access to 500 million Europeans, play by the rules* aka *we find the base business model of your sort of company, regardless of source, distasteful. Here have a regulatory ban.* to which Americans go *but but our freedom of entrepreneurship*. Which handily get slapped down in Europe with *comes way below the personal freedoms, rights and well being of EU citizens*. 

Europe doesn't recognize citizens united or other American laws making companies equal to groups of persons. Companies come way below on the rights ladder compared to a living breathing person. They have their rights, but separately listed and way more limited than persons rights. 

Company doesn't have unlimited right to be in business x, if X is considered harmful to consumers or society. Even if company could convince to get couple customers for X.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/8a96c7/margrethe_vestager_the_woman_who_is_reining_in/dwyid5i/,variaati0,1523087680

2469,"Stability Pact: Germany's national debt expected to fall below 60 percent in 2019

Fewer debts thanks to a good economy: According to SPIEGEL information, Germany is to comply with the European Stability Pact for the first time in a long time in 2019.


Germany's national debt is falling faster than previously assumed. According to SPIEGEL information, Federal Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) expects the debt level to fall to just over 58 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019. For the first time since the beginning of the 1990s, this would be below the 60 percent mark prescribed by the European Stability Pact.
This is the result of the new stability program of the federal government, which is to be approved in the cabinet next Wednesday. The Stability Pact is intended to limit the indebtedness of the EU states. It therefore provides for a maximum value of 60 percent of a country's annual economic output for public debt. The annual deficit may not exceed three per cent of GDP

In the current year, the debt level in Germany is still above the threshold at 61 percent. Recently, the German government still expected that the Stability Pact's target would not be reached until 2020. Instead, according to the new forecast, the debt ratio will fall to just under 56 percent in that year and is expected to reach 53 percent by 2021.

This positive development is attributable to high tax revenues, but also to the fact that the state's bank settlement funds are increasingly reducing their liabilities resulting from the financial crisis. In addition, Germany has been paying hardly any interest on new debts for years due to the continuing phase of low interest rates.

Germany's national budget has therefore been slightly in surplus for years. The new Finance Minister Scholz is also sticking to the ""black zero"" of his predecessor Wolfgang Schäuble. According to new plans, Scholz expects surpluses of the federal government, the federal states, municipalities and social security funds to be between one and one and a half percent of GDP throughout the period until 2021.

2504,"Oh fuck off with your Islamophobic bullshit.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-schwartz/new-light-on-bosnian-jews_b_9745662.html

&gt; Such individuals are memorialized at Yad Vashem. As described by Tauber, they included a number of Bosnian Muslims. His chronicle enumerates 47 Bosnians who saved Jews, of which 23 bear identifiably Muslim names.

&gt; For example, a Muslim family, the Fazlinovićes, lived alongside Jews in Sarajevo. Sulejman Fazlinović was a railroad worker. He and his wife Hasija protected four Jewish children, by taking them around “Greater Croatia” (which included Bosnia-Herzegovina during the war) disguised as their own offspring. The Fazlinovićes were honored by Yad Vashem in 1980.

&gt; A perhaps more remarkable story is that of the Hardaga family: Mustafa and his brother Izet, Mustafa’s wife Zeineba and Izet’s spouse Bahrija. Mustafa Hardaga rented property to a Sephard, Joseph Kabilio, who used it to launch a pipe factory.

&gt; The Muslim and Jewish families respected each other’s traditions, as recorded by Eli Tauber. The Hardagas were careful not to disturb the Jewish Sabbath by cleaning or dusting carpets and the Kabilios did not engage in festivities during the day in the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. Often the two family patriarchs sat and drank coffee, noting the similarity of their religions: both circumcised their sons, both refused to eat pork, both believe in one God, among other parallels.

&gt; When the Germans arrived in Sarajevo in 1941 many residents fled into the nearby forests. As people began returning to the city, Zeineba Hardaga searched for Joseph Kabilio and his wife Rivka, finding them in the streets with their children Benjamin and Tova. The Jews were taken into the Muslim home, and Rifka was presented in public as a Muslim woman. Zeineba Hardaga recalled, “This was the first time that [an unrelated] man had slept in our house... But Joseph was like a brother to us - if not before then, certainly from the day he entered our home.” After the war, Joseph Kabilio emigrated to Israel.

&gt; Zeineba Hardaga’s father Ahmed Sadiq-Saralop, for helping Jews, was deported to a concentration camp, where he perished. He and the Hardagas were recognized by Yad Vashem in 1984. In 1994, during the Bosnian War, Zeineba Hardaga was invited to go to Israel by that country’s government and passed away there.

&gt; One of the most notable, and better known, among Bosnian Muslims who saved Jews was Derviš Korkut, librarian of a local museum in Sarajevo. The museum housed, with other treasures, the beautiful illuminated Sarajevo Haggadah, a text for reading during the Jewish holiday of Passover. The Sarajevo Haggadah dates from pre-expulsion Catalonia or Aragon. (Passover for the Hebrew year 5776 begins on Friday evening, March 22, 2016.)

&gt; The German takeover of Sarajevo in 1941 led to an attempt by the occupiers to get their hands on the Sarajevo Haggadah, but Derviš Korkut told a German officer who came and demanded it that it had been given earlier to another German. Korkut held the Sarajevo Haggadah in safekeeping and returned it to the museum after the war.

&gt; Derviš and Serveta Korkut, like the Hardagas, protected a Jewish woman, Donkica Papo, by introducing her as a Muslim believer. Further, the Korkuts shielded two other Jewish families. Yad Vashem recognized the Korkut couple as Righteous Among the Nations in 1994.

2622,"&gt; Is this about that thing that you and Romania have about ethnic Hungarians in Romania?

Not only Romania but Serbia, Slovakia and Ukraine also. There are Hungarians in Austria and Slovenia also but there were never tensions about that.

Economic souverinity as before them the not only the goverment deficit was always high but the bond financing was done mainly by relying on either the IMF or EU help instead of doing it by market limiting any budget movement greatly, or even structural changes.

Hungary barely grow since the fall of SU mostly due to missmanagement compared to the region and 2002-2010 was esspecially worse in this regard. Not only unemployment, the problem was high inflation and low wages to macroeconomics, everything was failing. You could also aproach itn a way that Fidesz dodged the 2008 crisis by not being elected in 2006, but the leftwing goverments whole strategy was just oil on the fire. The biggest problem was before goverments didnt really care about small and medium enterprieses, while now the strategic and tax envirnoment is much better, also there are much better loans, but there plenty of other issues.

For the values the biggest problem of the left wing goverment was they didn't have a powerbase in the countryside, also its intellectual base was mainly from the liberal capital. They lost their traiditonal left wing values by their economic and social decisions while they were connected to the communist past both financially and by the elite ect. In constrast Fidesz to this day has a huge support from middle sized city intellectuals and from the high and middleclass in the countryside. The divide between intellectuals and middle class+ goes back centuries in this regard, its kind hard to explain but both in terms of values and the role of the nation and the state is different between the groups. Basically the left lost its traditional support and failed to gain new and was left with the communist past, letting down both groups while Fidesz is well seated in its own ideology with plenty of conservative supporters. They share conservative values such as the importance of family preferebly big, the respect of state and its bureaucracy, patriotic values ect. nothing extreme but traditional.

This combined with their lust for power is the recipe why corruption is getting out of hand now. While the left was also corrupt it didnt command the respect nor the power to centralize things to such degree, which while made things more efficient it also made it much more easier and tempting to reward your own supporters in the elite. Basically the current goverment is being attacked by it opponents that is rebuilding the old feudal system with nobles, which is not far from their ideology, and we know there is barely any difference between corrupt oligarchs and benevolent nobles taking care of their subjects as the best they can.",,/r/europe/comments/8acna1/kaczyński_hungary_will_point_europe_in_right/dwy4c3n/,mogyesz09,1523066072

2660,"The EU and Turkey seem to be becoming increasingly alienated. The minutes of a diplomatic meeting with a high-ranking Turkish ACP politician reveal deep mistrust.

By Oliver Mayer-Rüth, ARD Studio Istanbul

The EU-Turkey summit in Varna already indicated how far Brussels and Ankara currently lie politically apart. The protocol of an EU diplomat for a meeting with Volkan Bozkir, member of the Erdogan party AKP and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Turkish parliament, makes it clear once again that there is currently hardly any overlap between Ankara and the governments of the EU countries on foreign policy issues. Based on his expertise, Bozkir should know what he is talking about. His views are probably not too far from those of the Turkish President.

The ACP MEP met ambassadors and diplomats from various EU countries in Ankara for lunch at the end of March. In the minutes available to ARD, Bozkir is described as ""emphatically friendly and binding"". However, he had reproduced ""essentially well-known AKP positions"" and lost himself ""partly in bizarre conspiracy theories"".
EU summit assessed as positive

Bozkir, who was also Minister for EU Affairs in the Turkish cabinet in the past, assessed the EU-Turkey meeting in Varna as positive because it had succeeded in strengthening the dialogue and ""meeting each other's expectations of the summit"".

As a reminder: EU Council President Donald Tusk summed up Varna with the words, ""if you ask me whether we have reached solutions or compromises, my answer is no"".

""Infamous propaganda lie.""

The fact that between 2012 and 2015 Turkey ""did not act decisively enough against the'Islamic State' (IS) is an infamous propaganda lie,"" Bozkir told the diplomats. The background to Bozkir's criticism is the repeated accusations by Western politicians that Turkey does not take the dangers of the so-called IS seriously, or supports them by allowing IS fighters to travel unhindered from Turkey to Syria.

Bozkir also claimed, according to protocol, that Turkey was the first country to bring a ""severe defeat"" to the IS with the military operation in Jarablus that began in August 2016.

However, the anti-IS coalition launched air attacks against the IS in Syria as early as September 2014. In the following years, the Kurdish militia YPG was able to push back the IS in Northern Syria, partly due to support from the coalition's air raids.

""Ethnic Diversity""

After the ""Islamic state"" had been defeated, Bozkir said, and after a ""successful military operation in Afrin, the cards were now being reshuffled"". The goal of Turkish military intervention in Syria is also ""the restoration of ethnic diversity"". According to Bozkir, 500,000 Syrians would now return to Afrin. Commenting on Bozkir's statement in the minutes, the diplomat said: ""This admission is completely unrealistic due to the origin of the refugees and the capacities in Afrin.

Afrin is Kurdish. In recent weeks, members of the pro-Kurdish opposition party HDP have increasingly expressed concern that Erdogan wants to change the demographic situation in Afrin by locating Sunni Arabs who have fled to Turkey because of the Syrian civil war.

Bozkir also spoke at the meeting about the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. He could use blackmailed money for various political projects. The recording diplomat adds Bozkir's statement with the words, ""here it became bizarre now"".

Bin Salman, according to Bozkir's theory, wants to move ""Palestinians from Palestine to the Sinai Peninsula"". ""Libya should be divided into different states. A kind of Vatican state should be established in Mecca and Medina."" Apparently Bozkir did not want to reveal these findings to the diplomats.

Irritated diplomats

Prince Bin Salman recently surprisingly declared that the Israelis had a right to their own country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, recently described Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a terrorist. Bozkir's testimony seems to have irritated the ambassadors and diplomats.

If it had been one of the pointed speeches of the Turkish President, the sentences would have been dismissed as populism oriented towards Turkish domestic policy. However, since the lunch is actually a serious format, in which a circle of selected experts is to be introduced to Turkish foreign policy, the frowning of the audience is said to have been all the greater.

This was an agreement between 9 nations to limit navy sizes to prevent another arms race and it was when the USA achieved naval tonnage parity with the UK. Quite something considering the UK's previous 'two-power standard' which called for the Royal Navy to be more powerful than the next two greatest navies combined. Of course, America had already become a 'great power' following the American Civil War and by the 1890s had become powerful enough to challenge the UK in the Western Hemisphere, as seen in the 1895 Venezuela-British Guiana border dispute.

I don't believe America actually became a superpower with global influence and power projection capabilities until the Second World War. It's incredible to think that by the end of the war that America was responsible for around half of the world's industrial output. It's a shame that the 'American Century' with all its promise and opportunity has seemingly been squandered.

Seems armenians worked with this logic while occupying and ethnically cleansing azerbaijani heritage out of Karabakh.

1. During initial phase of Karabakh war numerous chechen and afgan groups joined the war, believing it's a religious war. But after seeing that, religion doesn't have any role in Karabakh war, they all left the war. 

2. Ramil Safarov killed an armenian military personnel and he's not a national hero of Azerbaijan. [Here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hero_of_Azerbaijan) list of national heroes of Azerbaijan. On the other hand, perpetrator of biggest terrorist attack on civilians in french soil (after latest ISIS attack) [Varoujan Garabedian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varoujan_Garabedian) welcomed as a national hero in Armenia, greeted by Armenian Prime Minister and was glorified by all armenian intellectuals.

Never did I imply that. They are proud compatriots of the Azerbaijani nation, along with other common ethnic groups like the Talysh who all fought side by side. I said Azeri has **ethnic** implications. Azerbaijani is the word you are looking for to describe citizens of Azerbaijan. A Talysh would not call himself Azeri, but... as a Talysh.

&gt;Furthermore, Ramil Safarov, who butchered a sleeping Armenian office and then was celebrated in Azerbaijan

Yeah, you already said this 3 times to two other people in this same thread. There are monuments in Armenia, school names, street names, etc - dedicated to terrorists of all types, an example being terrorist members of [ASALA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Secret_Army_for_the_Liberation_of_Armenia) who have bombed and killed innocent civilians throughout Europe and the world (of all ethnic groups), associated with Kurdish terror groups now. One of your most renown ASALA terrorist that schools are named after is Monte Melkonian, a left-wing Communist (but ethnic nationalist?) who engaged in terroristic activity overseas, arrested and imprisoned, involved in the civil war in Lebanon, even travelling to Iran and participated in demonstrations to **overthrow the Shah.** 

&gt; And yes I know that report, it in no way says that there is PKK in Armenia

Yeah ok, and your comment about a population of 10,000,000 and 1,000 Azerbaijanis joining ISIS is well representative as well. Armenia even allowed the PKK to propagate their terrorist beliefs, by allowing them to broadcast their channel and political agenda. [Example 1](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09YEREVAN830_a.html
), [Example 2](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06YEREVAN1484_a.html)

&gt;is far-fetched given that the actual Kurds don't like Yezidis

&gt;Yezidis are quite different from the Kurds of Turkey.

That's a lie. Kurds and Yazidis view themselves to be apart of the same nation. It is the Armenians who view Yazidis different to Kurds.

&gt;Sure Basayev came more for his holy war, but fact remains the Government turned to Afghan jihadists to bolster their war effort.

I won't dispute that mercenaries arrived from Afghanistan, I will agree, I believe it was [Roshvan Javadov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rovshan_Javadov) who may have hired a group of Afghans. Go ahead and add this to your bucket list, here is an Azeri helping you compile a list against the Islamic Turkic Azerbaijani Muslim Jihadi Terrorists.

&gt;'Bitching'? So if someone goes into your home, massacres your family, then not only denies their crime but boasts about the hatred, will you just keep quiet?

There are no boasts, but nobody is willing to see eye to eye with your people have literally done the exact thing, in fact worse considering how the Azerbaijani population is larger. Add that to the fact that you guys come here and try to make things even worse just adds fuel to the fire. You make it indicative that you're not searching for peace. Instead would rather boast how Armenians are tough European Christian warriors defending Europe against hordes of barbaric Muslim Azeris who are jihadists.

&gt;Turkey and Azerbaijan declare themselves one nation, two states, so the current threat comes from both.

Yes, so what? What is the problem sweetheart. We are both apart of the same nation (**Turkic**). We are also one nation with Kazakhstan, Gagauz, Chuvash, Tatars, Kumyk, Karachay, so on. Are you going to tell me that Orthodox Christian Chuvash's or Gagauz give a shit about your people? That Karachays care? Kazakhstan even allowed refuge to many Armenians. Want to hear somewhat of a threat from two states and one nation? Russia once said they would utilize nuclear weapons if Serbia faced existential threats.

also some people in the west have huge missunderstanding about east catching up soon to west, they think that eastern europe will soon catch up to west but any economist will say people who think that that its BS, because its based on assumption that east will continue to grow at current pace which is wrong, as east gets closer to west growth will slow down, until we reach point where we grow almost in parallel to west.
One of major problems in catching up to west is difference in productivity, yes productivity in the east is growing but guess what western productivity is also growing and its growing in parallel to east which means at current pace east will NEVER catch up to west. This is a problem because east can only compete with west by  keeping lower wages, so wages also wont catch up to west.

what makes situation worse is that people in east want to live as well as western people do so they migrate to west which is big brain drain for east this slows down eastern grown, currently its not that bad, in poland its kept at bay by hiring ukraine people but it will get worse with time, with poland low fertility rate.

From a Flemish political perspective, the Islamist party's plan is being fiercely reacted, mainly to the voices of conservative and pious Muslims.

Yet the party expressly says that it does not adhere to extreme Islam. ""We want an Islamic state without wanting to touch the Belgian Constitution. We are concerned with the values ​​of our religion, ""says  Anderlecht city council member Redouane Ahrouch and treasurer of the party.

The party had four candidates at the municipal elections in 2012. They were elected in Molenbeek and in Anderlecht, not in Brussels. This year the party hopes to do better. That is why the party arrives in fourteen Brussels and fourteen Walloon municipalities. Ahrouch wants to prove with Islam that extremists are a minority within the Muslim community. ""Many Muslims will vote for us because they are tired of our faith being linked to terrorism. We want to show that the extremists are a small minority "", it sounds.

Politicians respond
The proposal for separate public transport is not in favor with Flemish politicians. CD &amp; V chairman Wouter Beke calls it blatant in violation of the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights and calls for action.

Also Meyrem Almaci (Green) is the idea unwilling. ""Equality between man and woman is fundamental. No party can or may change that, ""she writes on Twitter.

State Secretary for Asylum and Migration Theo Francken (N-VA) reacts strongly to the proposal. ""I am disgusted by this party Islam. This is why @SafaiDarya (women's rights activist and N-VA politician, ed.) And thousands of other women had to flee Iran. This is not Europe, this is spitting on Europe. ""

Safai Darya (N-VA) grew up in Iran, but has been living in Belgium for 18 years. She made the sharia with her in the native country. ""Never thought that I should fight against this"", she writes on Twitter.

Open Vld president Gwendolyn Rutten warns in a video message that everyone who attacks our freedom will meet us. ""Every day again. And we are very much. Women and men work, party, swim and live together here. And that will stay that way. ""

There was no such thing as citizenship of ""The Georgian Soviet socialistic Republic"", he was citizen of the USSR. And when there was the USSR, the South Ossetia had special status within Georgia and they had right to quit Georgia what they finally did.

&gt; But it's nitpicking, not an actual argument.

Call it nitpicking if you wish. For me it is twisted fact.

&gt; So either you were trying to deceive me with bullshit pseudoarguments, or you're having a hard time processing reality. Which is it?

I was trying to tell you that hundred yards looks like a one-sided border demarcation, not like a creeping occupation by Russia which lasts for decades, it is simply ridiculous.

Why is demarcation one-sided you may ask? Because Georgia refused to discuss this matter , they say to South Ossetia: ""You don't exist, you belong to us"". So Ossetians took Soviet maps and actually captured some territory, I never denied it, but I think their claims can be justified and everything is not so simple as Western media likes to portray.

I don't think you will even try to understand it or find different sources on this topic, why bother when there's convenient stereotype about evil Russia which explains everything: POTUS elections, Brexit, Catalonia events, border disputes and so on.

Yes you did, to paraphrase an internet maxim, everything that has been said before ”*but*” is a lie. 

&gt;They could just as well been Turks, Russians, Romanians, Hungarians or whatever and just the same Romanians would have cut those trees and sold them.

They weren't Turks, Russians, our own, ~~[Hungarians](http://www.zf.ro/eveniment/partidul-regelui-cherestelei-va-administra-padurile-de-10-mld-euro-ale-romaniei-cum-comentati-5198669/)~~ or whatever. They were Austrians and enabled germanophiles to work for them, to break laws, and profit off their economic anxiety &amp; our financial situation as a whole; *juuuust* same scenario done ever since our industries were sold for peanuts. Don't you lecture me on nothing. 

&gt;My point is that this had nothing to do with how those Romanians feel about Germans, Austrians or any other nation (including how they feel about Romanians). There was no ""germanophiliac"" sentiment at play here that made them do it and you only brought that up to justify your sick rhetoric. They would have done it for a Romanian company also.

Conjuncture.                            
*You already apologised for Austrians and the xenophilia reeks. You have the same exact, [toxic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders), rhetoric; yet you call mine ”sick”, pffft.*

At least when it comes to insects the situation is **so** bad (and was ignored for decades) that we're not even sure how bad the actual damage is. Hell, we're *still* ignoring the reality and aren't doing anything about it on a larger scale.

Most of the data we had so far was extremely limited, simply because so few people cared.
___
For example ants: We know that 2.7% of all ant species in Germany are not endangered and that 53% are in various states of being endangered. [Data from 1998](https://www.lfu.bayern.de/natur/rote_liste_tiere/2003/doc/tiere/formicoidea.pdf) which is the most recent one available.

Similar for [birds](http://www.br.de/rote-liste/voegel-rote-liste-bayern-deutschland-artenschwund-100.html) (although they're cute so a few more people care): 

45% of breeding bird species are endangered. Only 13% of bird species breeding in open areas are *not* endangered.

Where all of this ties together is [this study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809) that wrapped up the results between 1989 and 2016: **Insect biomass went back by 75% in this timeperiod**.

3232,"Neither Poles nor Lithuanians saw each other as enemies before beginning of Polish-Lithuanian war, they saw each other as brothers, but with different opinions: Poles wanted for Lithuania to stay as ethnically mixed Polish province, while Lithuania due to Lithuanian National Revival (Lithuanian National Awakening) caused people to want an independent Lithuanian state. There were Poles who sided with Lithuania like Stanisław Narutowicz - one of the twenty signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania and brother to the first president of Poland - Gabriel Narutowicz. He was also the only Polish–Lithuanian member of the Taryba, the provisional Lithuanian parliament formed in the later stages of World War I.

&gt;Poland did not recognize independence of Lithuania as Polish leader Józef Piłsudski hoped to revive the old Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (see the Międzymorze federation) and campaigned for some kind of Polish–Lithuanian union in the Paris Peace Conference.

&gt;The Lithuanians claimed Vilnius as their historical capital and refused any federation with Poland, desiring an independent Lithuanian state. They regarded Polish federalism as recreation of Polish cultural and political dominance. The Lithuanian government in Kaunas, designated as the temporary capital, saw the Polish presence in Vilnius as occupation. In addition to the Vilnius Region, the Suwałki Region was also disputed. It had mixed Polish and Lithuanian population.

[1919 Polish coup d'état attempt in Lithuania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1919_Polish_coup_d%27état_attempt_in_Lithuania)

&gt;At the time international situations of newly independent Poland and Lithuania were unequal. Poland, much larger in territory and population, was dedicated point #13 in Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points. It was recognized by all nations of the Entente, officially invited to the Paris Peace Conference, and became one of the founding members of the League of Nations. Poland also enjoyed a close alliance with France. Lithuania did not receive international recognition (it was first recognized de jure in July 1920 by Soviet Russia) as the Entente hoped to revive the Russian Empire within its former territory, which included Lithuania. Not invited to any post-war diplomatic conferences, it also had to battle negative propaganda that the Council of Lithuania was a German puppet, that Lithuanians harbored pro-Bolshevik attitudes, or that Lithuania was too small and weak to survive without a union with Poland.

3234,"First of all how would you imagine somebody to tell anything else and not be persecuted?? I mean for real, even journalists from Ukraine who openly stated their opinion about our whole civil war (like Ruslan Kotsaba, Eugene Timonin, Dmitrii Vasiltsov) they look at a real jail time. A jail time! From court! Only after international pressure (which is very hard to get, because all try to turn blind eye to stuff happening in Ukraine) - they've got released. But even from their words - there are countless examples like them, they just don't have the same attention like these fortunate ones.
And we are talking about people from Donetsk. There would an enormous amount of persecution both from nationalists &amp; government (like there are no examples of that?? :) ). Of course everybody in their right mind keep silence (I know dozens of people in Ukraine, who just understand that there's no other choice other than keep ur mouth shut. Even some from ukrainian military force - because it's almost impossible to get a discharge, or just waiting for their pension - no other job around).
And anyway just look at the statistics of ukrainians who flew into Russia. But really, what does this have to do with anything. ""Millions of people fleeing from Russia occupied regions"" - 1) not ""millions""; 2) I don't see russian people around in the city.. like really. for fuck sake just come here, or watch some ukrainian journalist that actually did; 3) most of the people go to the places where they have relative/ they can find a job/ or both.

&gt;Your timelines are wrong and i think i have heard stories like that before. Oh, i remember: russian news channels in 14-15. What a coincidence.

What's wrong with my timelines? I was following it as it went, using Ukrainian channels as much as Russian ones (I still have hard time believing that people cannot *understand* Ukrainian, but I'm Belorussian, maybe it's easier for me). If something similar to Odessa happened in Kiev - Western news would **still** be talking about it. But as it was - nobody cared.

&gt;They have rights. But if someone wants to invite russian troops, take russian arms, kill pro-ukrainian activists and create fake ""referendums"" while completly ignoring ukrainian conatitution - they should be ready to face the concequences.

Ah... I see. Welp. So there we come to the main point, don't we? I guess you would have no problem with Yanukovich bringing in some Crimean/Donbass division in tanks to shell and take out **someone who invites hostile foreign politicians, takes up arms, and makes normal functioning of central government impossible while completely ignoring Ukrainian constitution**? Oh, wait, no... I forgot!!! That was legitimate protest against evil, corrupt, totalitarian regime (that killed and imprisoned maybe 1% of what current regime has, and that's being generous), and *these* are foreign-supporting (wrong foreigners, mind you!) traitors. Of course.

And I'm a doublethinking hypocrite? Look, I'll take you on an even board **ANY DAY**. But there have to be some sort of real, *rules* that **apply to everybody**. We will never accept your desire to have one rulebook for NATO and its minions and another for everyone else. It won't work, and anyone who will try will go the way of Ukraine.

3246,"&gt; I said that if they're currently fighting off a land invasion then they're not able to join NATO since it'd lead to diplomatic tensions within NATO.

And **I asked you for a link** on official NATO document that backs this exact claim. 

&gt; Yea, what could go wrong with putting US and EU soldiers face to face with Russian soldiers in a warzone. What could possibly go wrong?

NATO soldiers are already ""face to face"" with Russian soldiers. Latvia is at the same distance to Moscow as Ukraine. But if you ask what would happen if there was a full-scale war, then the answer is Russia would lose, most likely in a few months. For this reason Russia wont ever attack a NATO country. In fact, they were scared as shit to attack Ukraine. If you look at 2014 events, the Crimean fake referendum was originally about reverting the 1992 Crimean constitution, Russia waited for the reaction from the West, only then decided to annex the peninsula. Russia done so with as few casualties as possible and there were no actions in eastern Ukraine. Only when they saw no serious consequences from the West, they decided to attack eastern Ukraine as well acting more freely and violently this time.

Russia only acts so ballsy because they see they dont get punished in any serious way. They openly start wars and meddle in the US election, and what are the consequences?

Many of the atrocities were seen as revenge for the atrocities against Turkish Cypriots in 1963–64 and the massacres during the first invasion.[124] In the Karpass Peninsula, a group of Turkish Cypriots, called a ""death squad"", reportedly chose young girls to rape and impregnated teenage girls. There were cases of rapes, which included gang rapes, of teenage girls by Turkish soldiers and Turkish Cypriot men in the peninsula, and one case involved the rape of an old Greek Cypriot man by a Turkish Cypriot. The man was reportedly identified by the victim and two other rapists were also arrested. Raped women were sometimes outcast from society

&gt; Or are you suggesting that I should pay taxes in a country I don't live in for money I made while not living in that country?

Go ask for voting rights in the country you work in and pay taxes &amp; dues; all of you. How about that, such revelation!

While continuing in daily use at monasteries and sometimes featuring at funerals for their deep notes sounded at long intervals, as well as at other services, semantra have also played a part in Orthodox history. Their origin has been traced to at least the beginning of the 6th century, when the semantron had replaced the trumpet as the agent of convocation in the monasteries of Palestine and Egypt, including Saint Catherine's in the Sinai; the rhythms struck on wood were soon vested with the aural memory of rhythmic blasts from earlier trumpets, an iconography of trumpeting that was eventually transferred to the zvon of Russian bells.

One reason why semantra continue to be used in southeastern Europe in particular is that the ringing of bells was outlawed during Ottoman times under Islamic rule, forcing monasteries to use the semantron instead.

&gt;Además alega que el Gobierno utilizó los 5 millones presupuestados y bloqueados por el TC para las elecciones autonómicas que tuvieron lugar en Cataluña el pasado 21 de diciembre. De hecho, en la respuesta se incluye el acuerdo de Consejo de Ministros por el que se aprueba un gasto de 25 millones para los comicios regionales, de los que se preveía gastar 17,3 millones de euros en 2017. 

&gt;En el citado acuerdo del Gobierno, firmado por Cristóbal Montoro, se explica que se aprueba una modificación presupuestaria de 12,3 millones de euros ya que había otros 5 millones previstos en las cuentas de la Generalitat.

Articles are intentionally misleading and won't mention this, you'll notice most say ""99% of cases brought to a judge"" so they can ignore jury cases or cases dropped beforehand. For instance, Japan also has a 99% conviction rate, but people are still getting fair trials. They just refuse to bring cases to trial that they aren't sure they'll win, though this is a bad thing.

Ironically the period when Poland was under 3 partitions, the largest of them under Russian tsar's rule, is taught in Poland as one of little progress.

The fuck is this load of bullshit? Are you trolling or something?

Serfdom was abolished in Poland before the partitions in 1791, but reinstated by the partitioners. Then it was abolished again in Prussian part in 1807 and in Austrian part in 1848.

3493,"&gt; they require violence and there wasn't any

Actually, the court decision does acknowledge there **was** violence. It considers, however, that said violence was not of such nature to overturn the constitutional order, which previous decisions of the Federal Court of Justice had considered to be a requirement to rate those acts as violence in the sense of the article of the German Criminal Code relating to high treason.

I don't think the debate is about to stop there. First of all, it is quite debatable that the violence was not of such nature (its aim at least was indeed to overturn the Spanish constitutional order). Secondly, this is only based on case law, and in a civil law jurisdiction such as Germany, case law (which in this case is quite sparse: people aren't frequently tried for high treason) is not binding as such.

3553,"&gt;My end goal as an asturian nationalist is an asturian nation inside a federalized spanish republic. I can tell you that will never happen, but well that's my end goal.

Then you're in for a life of neverending struggle. This wasn't even possible in the 80s when there was a nationalist union party of catalans, basques, and galicians, and they got the door in Madrid.

And so I must warn you, since you're (just a little) younger than me: It gets *bad*. It gets mentally exhausting, and psychological suffering *is* a thing. You told me you don't ""buy our drama"", but maybe you'll understand when you're a little older.

Because at points you will flip. The contempt will be continuous, it will never end —and it will even get stronger if you actually achieve any of your goals. 

Their goal is that you forfeit everything in favor of the big common national cause, and that you become an anecdote instead. They will start calling you a nationalist, comparing you to the worse facets of that feeling in history. They want you to disappear, because they don't like the idea of you. And mental exhaustion is part of their plan.

That's why Spain ignored the catalans push for over a decade, *because they could*, and because they expected us to break down and divide —as it always happened, until now. Instead, their overzealous approach achieved bringing together people that hate each other (right and far-left, religious and non-religious, CiU and ERC).

Maybe in 10 years, when you're in the same exact place you're right now, you'll start to understand why the catalans whining isn't whining, but it's instead an ""enough is enough"" kind of thing. When catalans mention Rosa Parks and many other minorities causes icons isn't because they think they've got it as bad, but because that's how it feels (a note: it's funny, to me, that spaniards think we're really *that* retarded). We hear what they had to say, and we say: ""We do feel like that, and we are being treated like they were"". At a point you've had enough and you break away from any Stockholm Syndrome.

Maybe the only chance you have of getting what you say you want (that federal Spain), will be the catalans push. Because only if they win, that old imperalist Spain will break down. Otherwise, Spains' recentralisation push will only get stronger and stronger.

&gt;You tell me about the re-centralising approach or about the AVE. I might ask you what's an AVE, because I've never seen one. I was born in 1992 and the isolation we have now is the same when I was born.

I know, I know.

Not only the re-centralising, though, but it being a broke project. There's *no* AVE that is economically viable: Not even the Barcelona-Madrid one is!

And so you won't see an AVE, because *you shouldn't see an AVE*, as most Spaniards shouldn't ever had. The only ones should have been product of a real necessity, of serious viability studies, and not of a crazy nationalistic project. Alas, there's none of them trains where there's a real need for them (i.e. the Mediterranean Corridor, for commercial reasons).

We're a poor country, and money should be spent with care, and not with XXth Century nationalistic ideas in mind. But the money that your cooficiality push would cost, is 1 to 10.000 the money that gets thrown out in those things, but you'll be called a waste, while that gets nothing.

Also: If you really benefit from some of your regions money, at least appreciate them. Don't insult your co-citizens at the same time you're benefitting from them. Solidarity happens within equals, and with respect; catalans getting their money taken away by people that enjoy insulting their identity is what started this whole thing.

It's really ironic to me that the people that benefit from our money think that the way of keeping having it is insulting us. Doesn't have any functional logic to it.",seditious af,/r/europe/comments/8a1fle/german_court_puigdemont_is_released_subject_to/dwwhl0f/,Erratic85,1523000793

Puigdemont did not succeed, so he cannot be tried for High Treason in Germany according to that judge. Note that the public prosecutor thought otherwise.

Still:

1) The ruling clearly states there is no political prosecution from Spain towards him.
2) He is forced to remain in Germany and meet the judge weekly.

He might very well be sent to Spain where he'd have to be judged for embezzlement.

I don't want him free or jailed. I don't give a damn. I just want him in a fair trial in Spain. He fleed the justice system of a fellow country and Germany should help with that, under our common European principles.

Now I don’t know if you are aware but borders between members of the Soviet Union existed from its very beginning and well before its end, which ultimately greatly facilitated its split.

And actually initially Soviets planned to transfer it to Lithuanian SSR, but Lithuania refused back then and refused one more time when this offer was made in 80s again.

So as Kaliningrad belonged to RSFSR at the moment of the USSR collapse, it became a territory of modern Russia. 
Now there are no clauses on any possible secession of its regions under Russian constitution ( and there were these clauses in the USSR constitution in article 72 - any members could leave at any moment) , so legally Kaliningrad cannot become independent on its own.

&gt;Show me where someone was arrested and convicted for speech that isn't also offensives in your country, and we'll talk. So far you've brought up a private business firing an individual for possibly causing a lost of business in their rationale that may not hold up and you brought up a profanity charge that was acquitted and awarded money for false arrest

Again, I've brought up profanity laws. Or listen to We As Americans by Eminem, or Marshall Mathers by Eminem and see how no, absolute freedom of speech doesn't exist in the United States either.

Also, you can joke about the holocaust by the way: https://youtu.be/O2_HbqPpQDk?t=4m41s .

3772,"It was not going to happen with serbs, they only agreed to negotiations when all militar options to achieve their criminal political goals were exhausted for them and offensives were stopped with blood of bosnian people who resisted. Among them was Sarajevo too which was  #serbian Sarajevo# according to blood drenched cartographers of Milosevic  and his bosnian serb executioners.

It did not happen in Rwanda too, goals of purpotraters were criminal and hate driven, salvation in those cases was supposed to be quick action by the international community. 

We all have seen how it ended up there too.  

For instance Mitterand's France was supporting Milosevic and bosnian serbs, resisting and delaying possible military intervention until the last possibly moment which directly translated (and was used) into free hands for serbs to continue ethnic cleansing on the ground etc. etc.... 
British foreign office policy of John Major's cabinet for the balkans in those times was so disgustingly calculative and permissive of serb violence that i seriously still believe there are people from his government if not himself, that even today should be put in front of the trial for direct responsibility of not doing anything to stop serb violence against civilian population of many cities, villages and hamlets. 
On contrary, there were sometimes clear signs of  support towards Milosevic's cynycal and lying policies of 'preservation of yugoslavia', supposedly by slaughtering all the people who do not agree with his 'all serbs in one state' plan's.

The list of 'helpers' in form of european bystander 'democraties' goes on and on untill USA decided to intervene for various reasons. Not necessarily humanitarian ones as it was politicaly formalised as Clinton needed clear goaled war to sell to his voters for domestic purposes. 
Serbs certainly helped to swing american public opinion with their daily dose of attrocities in the news so task was not all too difficult for Clinton administration. 
But whatever the reasons might be for US intervention, the fact stands that Europe betrayed Bosnia, Croatia and Slovenia in their time of need who wanted freedom and independence and by not be willing to acknowledge those legitimate aspirations. 
Many, many people payed with their lives for it and even more never returned to home after becoming refugees in foreign countries.
Later, there were a lot less 'clear cut' post yugoslavian conflicts in the world which required such prompt and determined action against slaughter such was this.
But money interests and investments of european bureaucrats in those arab countries were obviously much, much greater.

3843,"Me, well I will not shy away from this quesition, but let it be know that what I am advocating for here is for people to want reform, they don't have to want the same reforms I do.

For Spain: I am feeling quite federalist at the minute. I had actually been a centralist for a long time, but there was [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz5ZgLgJG_0&amp;t=1s) which made me see that the same fundamentals applied to buisnesses in terms of competition can be applied to provinces, and it's hard to say more than that because it so ""clicked"" for me. Having said that I stop a federalism rather than volatilising spain into city states because I also believe that there are certain issues that are best dealt with collectively. Go to examples are foreign policy (including defence) and the protection of basic rights (speech, press, association...)

For Europe: Well, here I feel like I  have to answer in two parts, one is the ""obvious"" and the other may be more fundamental. Firstly I agree that Europe is a bureaucratic mess, and honestly it is probably by design, I haven't gotten deep into the weeds, but if I were in charge efficiency would be #1 priority. Now for the fun stuff. It would seem to me that it is only natural for the governments of member states to allow devolve power to the general assembly, so that it's power comes from the people and not from themselves ()here the difference is the source of power not the amount - if that makes any sense?). Then I would probably like to test out (or at least see deeper discussion) about a multi speed Europe where the max speed is a federal state not too dissimilar from a united states of Europe.

Huh.  Looks like when he did die, we were the ones to write obituaries, though.  He was out of political favor at the time.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev#Death

&gt;Khrushchev died of a heart attack in a hospital near his home in Moscow on 11 September 1971, aged 77. He was denied a state funeral with interment in the Kremlin Wall and was instead buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. Fearing demonstrations, the authorities did not announce Khrushchev's death until the hour of his wake and surrounded the cemetery with troops. Even so, some artists and writers joined the family at the graveside for the interment.[278]
&gt;
&gt;*Pravda* ran a one-sentence announcement of the former premier's death; Western newspapers contained considerable coverage.[279] Veteran New York Times Moscow correspondent Harry Schwartz wrote of Khrushchev, ""Mr. Khrushchev opened the doors and windows of a petrified structure. He let in fresh air and fresh ideas, producing changes which time already has shown are irreversible and fundamental.""[280]

Yes, I too have heard the vitriol, but not wishing to make excuses for mi """"""side"""""" I doubt most of it is serious/directed at the people. Now please let me explain. I recognise it must be hard for Catalonians to be in the receiving end of this, I believe that Spanish &amp; Spanish people are harsh to hear, perhaps perceived as rude or insensitive, but most of it (I hope) is in good spirit. Secondly I have heard real distain for the politicians, but from what I have gathered under it is genuine emotion that wants to explain to the voters of ERC or JuntsxSi or CUP why we should stay together, but they too in their passion miss that they are the culprits for what they claim to want to avoid. 

So bottom line is, I understand it is there and as I said I too empathise with the Catalans, but at the end of the day we all have to start to work together or we will quite literally tear ourselves apart.

3887,"Ok, I think I am starting to see what you mean, (if not necessarily agreeing with it) - But at least this way I feel like we are making progress.

Firstly, you are right to be ""together"" requires mutual respect and we don't have that now. But you make sweeping accusation that it will *never* happen. I believe that sets the wrong tone for the whole debate, if you go into a negotiation hoping that things go wrong it will fail. But lets start with baby steps. I respect you, not only that but as I have re-iterated many times in this thread I love you, all of you. and I hope by now you respect me. So there we go. Only another 40 million or so, cant be that hard can it :).

Now please, if we are to build consensus you cant kick down the doors to the conference room and scream ""RAAAPISTS THE LOT OF YOU"". I will acknowledge that harm has been done in the past, but if we fixate on it then you may just be right and we won't be able to move forward, but if we instead work on healing the wounds there is an end in sight. Firstly it hardly seems fair to blame the current regime for things that happened in 1683, however I have the nagging feeling that you are talking about things still within living memory. Of course it is an issue that Spain has just come out from under a dictatorship, of course there are going to have to be changes. That was what the constitution was for. Don't like that either? Good, this is more progress, now the villan isn't all of Spain for all eternity. What bit is it that you hate the most? what would you change/add/remove? do you have something in mind. Now think, could that be a law/amendment? if yes, then we have done it, we have come up with a reform. If not then we might have to think harder, all of us. Now of course this will be hard, but so will independence and this feel more unifing, doesn't it. Lets stop burning bridges and make some.

Now you mention Catalans aspiring to be a ""ridiculous minority"". Firstly man I say that you have cast these terms upon yourself. Don't call yourselves ridiculous, now all of Spain can't talk about anything else. Ahh what the Andalusians would give for all of us to want to fix their problems. I will say here that Catalonia is as represented as all other regions, although not quite since the population is pretty concentrated so it is under represented. Well, I heard that Ciudadanos had a proposal to fix that, but surely we can't have nay common ground with them? Well perhaps not, I could see people not liking that policy (notice I said policy because that is what we were talking about, the party is irrelevant (unless you want to talk about it)). Other policies, would federalism be ok? why not? the basque model? what is the specific representation you are looking for, and can we work that in. Yes it requires though and energy, but so does this secession movement, and I feel like working towards each other is more productive.

&gt;“Our speakers are coming from the countries where demographics has changed greatly in last few decades. United States, for example, has evolved from nearly all white society of 1950’s to the current situation, where whites are becoming minority group in their own country. The same trend is happening in almost all western countries. As a nationalists with European background, we oppose this replacement of our people with foreign elements” he says.

Cool.  So you have two options if you're unhappy about immigration:

* Try and figure out ways to get people to have more kids.  Solves demographic issues, makes the government happy, deals with national finances.  Makes country better-off.  Constructive.

* Harass immigrants/start friction to try to ""drive them out""/block immigration and provide no alternate source of people.  Weakens country, wastes resources.  Not constructive.

This was actually mostly due to hydro, given how much it rained in March. 

&gt; Whole year is really the shortest period that is meaningful to report.

Here is a table depicting Portugal's renewable energy production 1995 - 2016. 

https://www.pordata.pt/DB/Portugal/Ambiente+de+Consulta/Tabela

As you can see, the main renewable energy source has been hydro. More recently there was a huge investment in wind. Wind production is close to being on pair with hydro. Wind is also used to pump water back to dams during the night. Still almost no solar, and that's the next big step. 

With hydro + wind + wind/dams storage + solar, one gets pretty decent coverage. 

What's missing is capacity to export, due to lack of connections to France and the rest of Europe. Locality exacerbates the problems with renewables. ",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/89ew29/renewables_produced_over_100_of_portugals_power/dwvtz5g/,autoclismo,1522972160

&gt; it's ridiculous to apply such modern notions of ""don't sell weapons to bad guys"" to the late 1800s

The policy continued through WWI and after WWII, when Turkey became a NATO country. Turkey then proceeded to use its arms not to defend itself from red Russia, but to turn a third of the island of Cyprus a concentration camp. The  Turkish military raped so many women that abortion was temporarily legalized. 

Turkey used Leopard 2 tanks and Heckler and Koch G3 rifles in their invasion of Afrin this past January, which has resulted in the death of hundreds of civilians displacement of tens of thousands, so the modern notion of *don't sell bad weapons to bad guys* clearly has not deterred the German government from selling weapons to Turkey. 

If the strategy of selling those weapons post-WWII was to endear Turkey to the West, then that strategy has failed.

4083,"which can also be considered violence depending on the way you do passive resistance. The German legal term ""Gewalt"" , translated ""violence"" is something that is defined really loose these days. The main problem is that this term is used for coercion as a main element for a coercion that goes beyond a mere threat. Violence there is defined as:

&gt; Gewalt i.S.d. § 240 ist der körperlich wirkende Zwang durch die Entfaltung von Kraft, vis absoluta oder durch eine physische Einwirkung sonstiger Art, die nach ihrer Zielrichtung, Intensität und Wirkungsweise dazu bestimmt und geeignet ist, die Freiheit der Willensentschließung oder Willensbetätigung eines anderen aufzuheben oder zu beeinträchtigen, vis compulsiva. 

roghly translated:

Violence is any physial force through the use of power, vis absoluta or pyhsical effect in other ways, which, in its aim, intensity and effect is meant and able to cancel or impair the freedom of choice and the application of the free will of someone else.

This is a really rough translation and it is the definition of violence for coercion, but it nontheless gives an impression what is considered as violence under criminal law. I am pretty sure that the definition was counts as violence is similar to high-treason, just that here, the amount of force used needs to be enough to endanger the constitutional order.

But considering this translation, even passive resistance can be a form of violence, depending on what exactly the protestors do.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/8a1fle/german_court_puigdemont_is_released_subject_to/dwvmo4u/,MisterMysterios,1522965185

4085,"If your main argument that they did not have the military strength after Afghanistan or that they lacked technology, then it does not really hold up. Or does the US have any serious success in Afghanistan? With the strongest army in the world by far and with by far superior technology? No. Because it's very difficult to fight in that region. 
And a country with the most Nukes in the world is a serious threat no matter what. They have spent around 300 Billion dollars in 80s on the military. Saying that they were weak and unable to put under control their satellite state is just naive. While on top it all they had a ton of allies in those countries who were in power and whose soldiers were loyal. It would not be that difficult to crush the revolution and the spirit of those protesting if Gorbachev chose to do it. It would be costly and in the long run, it would not help them, but they could have surely done it and USSR could have lasted another 20 years or more. Gorbachev is being mentioned in this spirit because he did what was rational, which is not something previous USSR leaders would have done. 

Also, you can make the same (wrong) argument with US and Vietnam (war lasted 20 years, while Soviets were in Afghanistan for just over 9 years). Were they weak because they struggle so much? How come the Vietnamese put up such a fight when they are 3rd world country? Because its incredibly difficult region to fight in. And guerrilla warfare is very cost effective. You don't have to have top army or technology to make it too costly for the invader to continue such conflict if you live in such regions.

BTW, Israelis won the first war (their war for their survival) with weapons from Czechoslovakia. After that, they were pretty much established. And I don't think that in following decades the sole reason for why they are dominant in that region is technology, but maybe even more importantly that they are highly organized and motivated since almost every neighbor has a serious hate for them. They have to have much better soldiers and generals to survive. They are much more driven.

But one IS the superior of the other.

This only has come to this point because Spain has refused, for a decade now, to face a political problem *politically*.

The reason they did this, is also political. Any party that gives in to catalans in Spain, loses the next elections. We're currency, insulting us is a national sport, *and that feels like shit*. If the UK did any glimpse of that, the Scot ref would have pushed through. They didn't, because they don't hate scots like half of spaniards hate the catalans.

They pretended, then, to solve it by force.

This is deeply insulting to one of your national minorities, which is actually recognised and part of the Constitution, in which it says we must be respected. By refusing to hear us, they're actively going against their own Constitution.

Then we of course push against it, but we wouldn't ever have done so if they didn't reject their responsibilites as the heads of the State --the king included.

4327,"&gt; So yes, I totally see people not wanting to accept reality, best example for that is when the discussion doesn't even include crime anymore but talks about ethnicity and how we Europeans are going to be the minority in a few decades.

Yes, of course, it contributes to it, but deep down, it isn't the main reason. If the people didn't have a completely different worldview than you, then they wouldn't filter the information in such a different way than you. The reason why they filter the information in the way they do is because they have different values, a different mindset, grew up in a different background etc.

&gt; If we throw those over board in times of hardship, how valuable are these values and laws actually?

They aren't valuable to everyone equally. What is unacceptable to you isn't necessarily unacceptable to everyone. The values and international obligations that you talk about were largely established in the Western Europe after WW2 by people with a certain historic experience that was then passed on to other generations.

But this historic experience is weakened somewhat with every generation and in another part of the continent, there is a different historic experience and a different approach to outsiders. In Hungary, Poland, CZ or Slovakia, we are technically following the same conventions as you, but realistically people here have very different attitudes towards outsiders who are considered high-risk.

For you it's unacceptable to physically reject them at the borders, over here, it's not just acceptable, it's actively demanded by the population. There is an absolute priority put on the safeguarding the country against any perceived outside threat even if that means that some other people will suffer.

Again, you might strongly disagree with this, but this is how it is for some people. In your country, it's still a relatively small part of the population who think this way, another part sort of leans in that direction, i.e. would be willing to accept tougher measures, not quite as tough as letting the migrants die or suffer, even though this is kinda what we are already doing when we made the deal with the Libyan tribes at the coast.

But you need to understand that other people simply have different value-sets than you. It doesn't mean that these people are necessarily evil or cruel, it's simply that the historic experience of their in-group taught them completely different priorities compared to you.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/89y2th/6_algerian_men_charged_with_gangraping_irish/dwuvx0g/,kristynaZ,1522942758

To get from Russia to not-Eastern Europe by land, you have to cross either Ukraine or Poland. Gas transit through Ukraine has proven to be unreliable over quite a few years. Gas transit through Poland has little prospect of being any more stable, given the country's political alignment. A transit project over the Black Sea, Turkey, and further through the Balkans was scrapped by the EU. Nord Stream, however, remains operational, so it makes sense to develop this pipeline in order to get the gas reliably.

Long story short, increasing dependency means increasing Russia's share on the market, which is a question to the market, not the supply lines.

4426,"Great article, too bad nobody is reading it instead opting to jerk off to their own ideology rather than discussing. Here's the most striking excerpt from my point of view:

&gt;Why is there this asymmetry? Because for Europe ""the most decisive aspect is undoubtedly of vital essence: it is internal dynamism, its ability to adapt without betrayal to innovate and yet consenting to openness, to discuss and cooperate with the other without losing its identity (...). What is lacking is on the one hand vital impetus, self-confidence, ambition, and on the other, awareness of its unity. If elsewhere people get passionate, Europeans are not very passionate, not about their joint project in all events; passions exist within the nations, but they often tend to be defensive or negative. It is a European ambition that has to be created or revived. But this in turn cannot come from a State, it must be open both to the nations that comprise Europe and to the world which surrounds it and from which it cannot isolate itself""[24]. In other words it means reviving European pride and confidence, starting with reasserting the principles that form the heart of what they are.

&gt;But as Luuk van Middelar rightly said ""historically Europe has only been half prepared for a task like this. The Founders pursued two goals at the same time. Was the unification of Europe a project of peace or project of power? (...) As part of a project of peace Europe is ""an eminently moral act"" supported by the desire for reconciliation and by idealism. As a project of power European integration is a political act based on conviction and involving the redefinition of the participants own interests. **In the first case national citizens must become stateless citizens of the world (or depoliticised consumers); in the second instance, they must become committed Europeans and even be proud of their identities. In other words the project of peace demands the sacrifice of national identities to the benefit of universal values, whilst the project of power demands the development of a European identity""[25].**

I find the last part in particular interesting since I have begun to challenge the notion of the EU as a peace project based on the very criticism that the EU is as much about power as it is about peace. One can clearly see how ""Europe the peace project"" is not sufficient any longer. This is where I see a pro-EU right can make huge inroads and take a huge amount of voters with them - by rejecting the depoliticised consumer and focusing on a combined European-National identity instead.

Edit: Or rather, a synthesis of national and European identities.

4452,"I have never understood what ""multiculturalism"" means in an European context. The native culture of the different EU countries is fairly diverse. Migrants bring their own. Politicians, depending on where they lie on the spectrum, attempt to define it to make their side look better.

Its easier, and better to define values rather than talk about multiple cultures. 

Each culture has good and bad things, and the discussion goes around and around. Having different cuisines from different cultures is a good thing, but NOT ffs, different standards in a court of law for a man who has beaten his wife because his lawyer claims that ""culture""resulted in him not knowing better.

No compromise on values. If certain cultures require values such as women being inferior to men, those values need to be discarded by immigrants. Defining European values is much simpler, and better understood than defining European culture.
I think European values can reduced to being as basic and simple as equality, and the rule of law.

&gt;""Russian colossus beating back the Nazis by themselves""  

Even german commanders admitted this would have eventually happened with or without allied help

&gt;Yet Zhukov admits otherwise. He would have literally no reason to lie about this- and he certainly would have more then a sufficient understanding of materiel necessary to understand such things. 

addressed in first paragraph. Also Zhukovs memoirs are full of delusions of grandeur (His recount of counteroffensive on Ukraine being prime example, denouncing Kipronos´s leadership despite the fact that Kipronos was only front commander which managed to mount proper defense - Pavlovs command was reduced to single army (4th and pinned down) and Kozlov effectively lost 8th and 11th army at day one - and actually push germans back for a short while - how did Zhukov thought that single rifle corps could change the final outcome is beyond me though).

4473,"&gt; although Catholics seem to like alterboys.

The Church did admittedly have a sexual abuse scandal that went on, but the scale of it is nowhere near what the media portrays it to be. [Children are a hundred times more likely to be abused by a teacher at school than by a priest.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/has-media-ignored-sex-abuse-in-school/) I'm definitely not trying to downplay the severity of it, but we should keep that in mind. 

&gt;My critique is more targeted towards the attitude of opinions, and thoughts about people. Let me give you an example. In 2016 i attended the Adventist Nordic camporee (Pathfinder camp) and there was a ceremony every day. There, most of the preaching revolved around accepting everybody nomatter what, and how you are supposed to be a good person always. Except when it comes to homosexuals and people that did not follow the way of God. 

They're partly right, but we should be loving accepting to literally everyone (including homosexuals and non-believers). 

&gt;I think this is a double edged sword, and I hate the fact that a lot of people feel amazing about themselves because their moral compass is superior to others, but they still preach about how homosexuals should die and go to hell.

That's the problem with a lot of Protestant sects (Adventists are one of them), they don't get the full message of Christianity. For example, you have some sects vehemently denying science because they treat the Bible as a science book (it isn't) or treating some groups of people (like homosexuals) as if they were lepers that don't exist. 

That's just a no for me. I know not all Christian's are like that. I really do. Ive just had some bad experiences.



&gt; That's just a no for me. I know not all Christian's are like that. I really do. Ive just had some bad experiences.

Yeah, that's understandable. I'm a Catholic man who has same-sex attractions (I guess the label is ""homosexual"") and I can attest to the fact that Catholicism sticks to the message of Christ, which calls for the world to repent from its sin (everyone is a sinner, anyone who pretends otherwise is fooling themselves). The Church teaches that everyone can come to Christ, whether you're a homosexual or atheist. I have a close friend and he was a Pentecostal (another Protestant group) and he was depressed for a long time because they drilled it into his head that he's going to hell for being a homosexual (despite being celibate like me). Eventually he found his home in Catholicism. 

All I'm saying is that you should definitely look into Catholicism, even if you feel like you're done with Christianity/church. There's a lot of weird Protestant sects out there (I honestly think Adventists are one of them) that give the rest of us Christians a bad name, but we're not all like that.

No, it isn't. Name one thing where religion is *better equipped* than science to explain anything. Best case scenario you have a ""I have no clue"" from science and a ""I have no clue, so I'll just make some shit up"" from religion, that's not explaining anything, that's making shit up.

This is totally true. But since you're the person making the claim you should be the person backing it up.

If I told you my next door neighbour is the son of God and I wasn't able to provide any evidence and yet I continued to believe it because you can't prove he is not and ""this is not the proper plane to answer that question"", you'd rightfully believe I was insane.

4600,"&gt;So people that do it here are more Muslim than what would be acceptable back at their country of origin.

Except that's not the case. For a child, they don't begin to accrue sins for their actions until they hit puberty. So for that child, if they choose to wear the hijab, that's up to them.

However, the child is not required to wear a hijab until they reach puberty, so if the parent is forcing the child to wear a hijab, that's on the parents.

If Allah shows mercy to your children, but you take away that mercy, does that make you a better Muslim? I would think not.

It's in the same vein as people saying women that wear the hijab are oppressed, even though they themselves don't understand the meaning of the hijab, and that it's actually there to free the women from the perverseness of society.

A woman walks down a street in a city. She can feel eyes on her, running up and down, sizing her up. She hears cat calls, she's hit on. She just wants to get where she's going. Is that not oppressive to the woman?

Islam teaches men to avert their gaze in the presence of women, and Islam teaches women to hide their beauty for the man she's betrothed to.

Orthodox Jewish women aren't meant to show their hair in public after marriage, so they chose to wear wigs. Is this oppression?

Hasidic Jewish women used to shave their head completely upon marriage, and cover it with a shawl in public. Why do you cut the hair that brings you beauty? For your religion? Is this oppression?

Christian Nuns wear clothes strikingly similar to Muslim women. Is this oppression?

Leaders of the church are sometimes married to their religion, not allowed to have their own wife/husband/children. Is this oppression?

There are things that may seem like oppression to an outsider, but is a perfectly normal way of life to the insider.

Until the entire world decides to follow the same faith/ abolition of faith, then there will always be people that think their neighbour is a savage.

4609,"As one comment pointed out, wearing uniforms is prevalent in several countries. I personally went to a private catholic school where we had to wear uniforms. Irrespective of your religion, you had to wear skirts if you're a  girl or trousers if you're a guy.

One of their reasons is that it treats everyone the same. The rich kids dress the same as poor kids. And because everyone looked the same, we all got together irrespective of our background. Sometimes, I didn't even know the cultural background some of my best friends are from. Only when I went over to their place for a girls night out or a party, did I realize that were different from my background.

So, to me, having a uniform clothing for schools is kind of good idea. You help children get close to one another. They become friends despite their differences. And, as time passes they learn to love their friend despite different backgrounds. It's like establishing common ground first and then exploring differences. Although, I don't think we had any girls wearing headscarves. But, there were a few Sikhs wearing their headgear. I don't think the Sikhs can skip their headgear.

4629,"&gt; Except when you were making an argument about all of Europe, and then Denmark didnt matter, and then it was about all of Europe again...

It's about laws targeting specific religious groups in all of Europe. Like I already said the Danish law in question doesn't do this (in my opinion), so it's not really part of the argument I was making. I apologize if I was unclear about that, I was responding to a lot of comments at the same time so I might have rushed it a bit. Maybe what I should have said in the original comment was ""this article isn't about said Danish law, but this Austrian one"". I'll go back and edit it to be more clear, but I'll leave the original text for context.

&gt; Already there its quite evident that you view European as Northern European so you barely even know what you feel. Ask yourself this "" is corruption amongst politicians okay?"" if the answer is no then you´re not European.

Thinking corrupt politicians is acceptable is a commonly held ideal in Europe? That's news to me. I'm aware that there are corrupt politicians, but I'm pretty sure most Europeans would agree that it's not an acceptable situation when it happens.

&gt; You´re equating two different things and making wild assumptions based on that. ""the true purpose of the legislation"" give me a break.

I don't understand where I've done this. I started out in this discussion because I saw the argument of ""protecting kids from religious indoctrination"" as the excuse for this piece of legislation, which to me rings false when it only targets 1 religious group, and not all of them. Obviously I'm not a mind reader so I can't scientifically prove what the intent of this law is, but since it only targets muslims when other religions do similar (or honestly, in the case of circumcision, much worse) things, then to me it seems like the real reason is fear/dislike of Muslims.

4633,"&gt;Russia attacked Ukraine after they had a pro-EU and pro-NATO coup. It has everything to do with US and the West in general. 

The West did not attack Ukraine when an obvious Russian agent grabbed power. Obvious, because that's where he fled to when he was chased out of his gilded palace. Even assuming it was an illegitmate coup, why do you support one illegitimate ruler over another then? Even if countries have coups, that still doesn't give other countries the right to annex them.

&gt;So if expansion is the Russian goal, why did they only take Crimea? Why haven't they annexed central Asia or Caucasus? Why is Belarus still independent? 

Because they feared to provoke a reaction if they took more. They still occupy parts of Ukraine and in the Caucasus anyway, don't think they will ever have enough. Belarus has submitted to  Russian hegemony, they have what they want. It's part of Russia in all but name.

&gt;The reason behind the war in Ukraine is NOT the desire for Russia to expand, it is to protect their interests that were conflicted after the coup.

""Protecting their interests"" is not a sufficient reason to annex parts of neighbouring countries. This isn't the age of imperialism anymore.

&gt;Because Russia just happens to be located there... lol

4656,"""What is happening to national politics? Every day in the US, events further exceed the imaginations of absurdist novelists and comedians; politics in the UK still shows few signs of recovery after the “national nervous breakdown” of Brexit. France “narrowly escaped a heart attack” in last year’s elections, but the country’s leading daily feels this has done little to alter the “accelerated decomposition” of the political system. In neighbouring Spain, El País goes so far as to say that “the rule of law, the democratic system and even the market economy are in doubt”; in Italy, “the collapse of the establishment” in the March elections has even brought talk of a “barbarian arrival”, as if Rome were falling once again. In Germany, meanwhile, neo-fascists are preparing to take up their role as official opposition, introducing anxious volatility into the bastion of European stability.""

""When we discuss “politics”, we refer to what goes on inside sovereign states; everything else is “foreign affairs” or “international relations” – even in this era of global financial and technological integration. We may buy the same products in every country of the world, we may all use Google and Facebook, but political life, curiously, is made of separate stuff and keeps the antique faith of borders.""

""The most momentous development of our era, precisely, is the waning of the nation state: its inability to withstand countervailing 21st-century forces, and its calamitous loss of influence over human circumstance. National political authority is in decline, and, since we do not know any other sort, it feels like the end of the world. This is why a strange brand of apocalyptic nationalism is so widely in vogue. **But the current appeal of machismo as political style, the wall-building and xenophobia, the mythology and race theory, the fantastical promises of national restoration – these are not cures, but symptoms of what is slowly revealing itself to all: nation states everywhere are in an advanced state of political and moral decay from which they cannot individually extricate themselves**.""

""But to acknowledge this is to acknowledge the end of politics itself. And if we continue to think the administrative system we inherited from our ancestors allows for no innovation, we condemn ourselves to a long period of dwindling political and moral hope. Half a century has been spent building the global system on which we all now depend, and it is here to stay. Without political innovation, global capital and technology will rule us without any kind of democratic consultation, as naturally and indubitably as the rising oceans.""

""If we wish to rediscover a sense of political purpose in our era of global finance, big data, mass migration and ecological upheaval, we have to imagine political forms capable of operating at that same scale. The current political system must be supplemented with global financial regulations, certainly, and probably transnational political mechanisms, too. That is how we will complete this globalisation of ours, which today stands dangerously unfinished. Its economic and technological systems are dazzling indeed, but in order for it to serve the human community, it must be subordinated to an equally spectacular political infrastructure, which we have not even begun to conceive.

**It will be objected, inevitably, that any alternative to the nation-state system is a utopian impossibility. But even the technological accomplishments of the last few decades seemed implausible before they arrived, and there are good reasons to be suspicious of those incumbent authorities who tell us that human beings are incapable of similar grandeur in the political realm. In fact, there have been many moments in history when politics was suddenly expanded to a new, previously inconceivable scale – including the creation of the nation state itself**. And – as is becoming clearer every day – the real delusion is the belief that things can carry on as they are.""

4740,"&gt; &gt; The thing is, workers go where they can earn more money.

&gt; Workers go where they perceive they can live a better life.

Hmm, sure. ""Money"" is perhaps a little simplistic. But they certainly don't move to Paris, London or Amsterdam for the weather.

&gt; It is fun and games to go and work in London for triple the wage and five times the rent.

Supply and demand: if the cost of living in places like London is so high, it's because many people want to move there. And one of the main reasons why they want to move there is because they can earn more there.

&gt; Can you give me a (better) source that the same/similar workers are more productive in western europe than in eastern?

Well, [productivity rankings by country](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/mapToolClosed.do?tab=map&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tesem160) are telling enough. Now, you're going to answer: ""but I said the same/similar workers!"" Well, we are talking about more than twice the productivity in Ireland or Luxembourg than in Poland. Even allowing for distorted statistics due to tax avoidance via Ireland and Luxembourg, there's no way their workers are *that* different.

&gt; From my experience productivity mostly depends on the workplace and work culture, not in which country they are.

Well, in my experience, the workplace and work culture depends **a lot** of the country (or even region) in which you are. But you also overlook other factors: infrastructure, access to capital, access to markets (both customers and suppliers), legal certainty, and so on...

&gt; Western european countries have higher average productivity because the workers have higher average education levels.

Well, yes, that helps. But, if anything, that strengthens my point: my *own* productivity also increases if my colleagues (and bosses) are better trained, never mind any bureaucrats I may have to deal with...

Of course, perversely enough, that turns a brain drain into a vicious circle: if most well-trained workers leave, those who remain increasingly struggle, giving them a strong incentive to leave as well, if only to work with their better-trained compatriots.

At the same time, that should give the countries suffering from emigration some pause for thought: if their more motivated compatriots are so much productive elsewhere that they can earn twice or three times as much for the same work, despite the certain handicap of working in a foreign culture and language, maybe there are problems that need to be addressed at home: not just the physical infrastructure (EU funding is usually pretty good at taking care of that, anyway) and, indeed, education, but also the ""institutional"" infrastructure: ensuring a strong, independent, reliable justice system, increasing transparency to fight cronyism and corruption, reducing bureaucracy or at least improving its efficiency, and so on...

It mostly describes why Turkey should *not* be a member of the EU.

&gt;Recently it has become clear that there is as much chance of Turkey joining the EU as there is of Britain joining the United States and sending MP’s to capitol hill with Angela Merkel AKA the most powerful person in Europe saying “The fact is clear that Turkey should not become a member of the EU.” This is a shift from her previous Pro-Turkish membership position and she’s not alone.

After the populist revolt, Merkel and other European leaders started listening more to EU citizens. And EU citizens simply [do not want](https://www.politico.eu/article/resistance-against-turkish-eu-membership-highest-in-germany-poll/) Turkey to join the EU. If Turkey is ever going to join the EU, especially in the short term, a *real* revolt might even break out next time.

And especially Turkey under Erdogan will never, ever join the EU. The EU cannot allow de facto dictators.

One thing though...

&gt;Despite all this membership hasn’t been completely been taken off the table, Turkey is still a major growing industrial power and Turkey’s powerful potion in the middle east and its role as gatekeeper **with the ability to allow thousands of migrants and refugees onto EU soil** means that ideas of a looser union, a sort of diet membership, with Turkey have been raised and it could be such a union that lies in store for a nation that seems to find itself increasingly unlikely to fill the gap left by a departing Britain.

And this is why we need better outer border control. An improved outer border control will help reduce the possibility of Turkey blackmailing the EU.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/89x8ke/turkeys_future_in_the_eu/dwubqp4/,Leocto,1522914480

4783,"Way to go, although not that easy technically, since in most cases it involves retrofitting existing dams and powerplants and taking them offline for a couple of years. Shutting down electrodams while claiming to go green would be a public-relations disaster that few politicians are going to support. Also, in  France at least, most electrodams are state-owned, and the State is cash-strapped, peddling familly jewels on the streets just to keep going and investing only when cornered or when a short-term political benefit ensues.

*Électricité de France* just unveiled a plan for massive storage, but I think the bulk of it is battery-based. Still barely in the gigawatt-hour range, while a smooth buffering of renewable electricity at a portugese scale would call for tens of terawatt-hours, 10,000 times more.

Now, whatever the form and the technology, storage isn't free. For every kWh you pump up, that's only 0.8 kWh you'll recover on the way down. No businessman likes a storage facility that kills 20% of the production.

And wait until some ecologists find that pumping so much water up and down the mountains has some nefarious impacts on local ecosystems and let the party begin ! You don't want the (imaginary) Dwarf Green Pyrennean Salamander to go extinct, you electrical monster ;-)

I know, I live in the West, and have noticed the recent trend, which I think is a phase we will grow out of once the issue is discussed further. 

I am actually an extremely liberal person, so please do not mistake me for a right winger. 

&gt; They have every right to do in Europe since we are a society that is liberal, free, and secular meaning that people can freely choose how they want to practice their faith without the state pushing them towards a particular faith.

I agree with you on the state not pushing them towards a particular faith, but in this case it is not the state pushing them towards a particular faith, but pushing them away from a particular faith. 

I believe in public school the main priority is to educate the children in the best manner possible. If a religion is conflicting with the laws of the secular society then it is ok to put restrictions on the religion. I will give a few examples. 

In the Islamic faith it is permitted to have multiple wives, but in secular Western society it is not. 

In the Islamic faith it is permitted in some cases to marry at an age far lower then the legal age in secular Western countries. 

So would you support those two being legal in the West?

The bottom line is that there are certain religious laws, traditions, practices, etc. that are simply not compatible with modern society and I personally believe that the hijab for children is one of them. When someone is an adult they can make whatever choice they want. Key word here is ADULT.

And the short ones:

**Russia**

Russia being called a half democracy is fair, I guess.  The term ""[illiberal democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illiberal_democracy)"" is what people in the West might use.

Russia's post-Soviet period was not very successful compared to some of the other USSR component states.  She has extensive natural resources, but a majority of her exports today are simply extracting and exporting this: she has not successfully diversified her economy.  She is also on bad terms with many of the countries that she needs to trade with, in Europe.  She also suffers from problems with organized crime.

She has historically been one of the top world military powers, and in some respects remains one: she can still land troops on foreign shores, still has reasonably sophisticated aircraft and armored vehicles (though in limited numbers), and air defense systems.  Her economic problems, though, invariably cause her military to weaken: she cannot maintain the kind of military thhat she once did.  I understand that a large portion of her equipment is probably not serviceable.

She continues to have second-strike nuclear capability and a large nuclear arsenal, enough to destroy any other country.  She can still kick off World War III.

I would say that she has territorial concerns with respect to China moving in on her land: she has begun [homesteading people in her eastern territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Homestead_Act).  This is normally useful to retain control of land.  If so, she's in the uncomfortable position of having some degree of concern about two larger entities that neighbor her.  Russia works with China because she doesn't have fantastic other options, but I think that there are strong limits on what China is willing to do for Russia.  Russia is engaging in friction with the US and EU simultaneously over issues that do not benefit China and exerting waning hard power.  Russia's star is waning, and China's is waxing; Russia wants to act with what power she has now, and China would prefer to wait and become stronger.  China can do a good deal for Russia; Russia can do less for China.  China has not shown interest in open conflict, but slower, cautious, more gradual pressure.  The last thing she wants is to be dragged into conflict with the US and EU over any dispute that Russia has with them without a great deal to gain from it.  I do not think that China and Russia form much of an axis today.

Russia's issues are mostly internal.  I think that she needs to make herself look more like the EU, but she has to accomplish this while competing with the EU and presently being unfriendly with the EU as well as most of her European neighbors.  She has to diversify her economy.

She also is in the center of a landmass and at a high latitude, which leads to extreme temperatures: heating is a cost, and agriculture is limited.

The only wins I know of come from global warming opening up Arctic access and making her land more useful.

Today, I don't think that Russia has a great trajectory.  She's got a number of problems, and her actions just aren't going to resolve them the way she going.  I don't think that she is a global threat as such, unless she starts going crazy with nuclear weapons.  Maybe a threat to some of her neighbors.

**North Korea**

Yeah, North Korea is done: I agree with you here.  I see no way in which she can reform without catastrophic collapse.  She cannot become competitive with the rest of the world without opening up.  If she opens up, everyone leaves.  China is wealthier and a nicer place to be (and a country with a surplus of men that is wealthier and is already taking in smuggled North Korean women), as is South Korea.

I don't think that China and North Korea form much of an axis either.  China would rather have North Korea — as long as things stay within limits — in the area if it keeps the US out, but North Korea just doesn't have much ability to do anything but stagger on.

China does not want a war on the Korean Peninsula initiated by either side.  Her common interest is in North Korea remaining right where it is as a buffer, ideally not stirring up a ton of problems.

Rhetoric aside, North Korea has no viable way to take South Korea and the US: this is suicidal for the regime.  Kim wants to stay in power.

So given that Washington, Beijing, and Pyongyang all pretty much want the status quo (albeit Washington wanting no nukes and Pyongyang maybe dreaming of one day having South Korea), there's no dramatic conflict in goals.  North Korea is a buffer for China.  It won't do much other than that.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/89u6q3/whats_the_relationship_between_us_and_europe_in/dwu1y12/,vokegaf,1522899396

4915,"During the Cold War, the closest allies of the US in Europe were the UK and Germany. Other top US allies included Canada (note that the US and Canada are closer than the UK and Canada), Japan, and Australia. Israel became a more important ally following the Six Day War in 1967. Relations with France were somewhat fraught due to France basically leaving NATO in 1966 (France took a more independent track in foreign policy during the Cold War). Relations with France have continued to improve over time again (sans issues with the Iraq War), particularly noted as France had fully rejoined NATO in 2009.

In the post-Cold War era, relations with the UK remained strong. Relations with Germany have as well, though the US-German relationship took a partial back-position for a number of reasons (e.g. Germany focused less on defense as the frontlines moved back, Franco-German relations helped define European action, etc.). 

As it currently stands (well let's consider pre-2016 election), US relations with the UK, France, and Germany were fairly strong (I'm less knowledgable with US-Italy and US-Spain relations, though the latter were muted until Franco died) (relations in the Trump era are still being felt out and we don't know how temporal or permanent these changes will end up being). 

In regards to some other countries, US-Greece and US-Turkey relations were defined by the Cold War and by the respective Greek and Turkey lobbies in the US (the Greek lobby is one of the strongest national lobbies in the US; note that the Armenian lobby which is also particularly strong provides a second counterweight against the Turkish lobby). For many Eastern European countries, relations with the US are defined around defense (e.g. Poland, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania), though are not limited to this. US relations with ex-Yugoslav countries are interesting because the US and Yugoslavia were tacit friends during the Cold War (""They're communists, but they're our communists"" (similar to US-China relations following Nixon's opening)), but relations soured with Serbia following the NATO bombings, while relations with most of the other ex-Yugoslav states are fairly strong (not completely sure about Macedonia).

As for US-Europe relations as a whole, the US has historically been one of the strongest proponents of European integration. This stemmed from the need for Western Europe to be united during the Cold War against possible attack by the USSR and allies. Thus, the US supported European economic and defense integration (the latter failed due to French objections). US support for European integration softened somewhat in the 90s as it opposed defense integration that would minimize the importance of NATO (see Albright's Three Ds). 

As a last point, US-USSR/Russia relations were extremely strong in the period between 1988-1992. The ex US ambassador the USSR at this time, Jack Matlock, has even said that they were the closest allies in the whole world at that time (closer than US-UK, France-Germany, etc.). Relations soured for a number of reasons. First, the USSR dissolved (HW Bush called against dissolution (except for the Baltic states), see ""Chicken Kiev speech""), which made less than an equal to the US. Second, the end of the Cold War was basically a negotiated truce between the US and USSR; however, in the 1992 US election, Bush and Clinton treated it like a US victory over the USSR (it sort of looked like that due to Communism melting away east of the Iron curtain and the USSR dissolving). Russia leaders took offense to this, especially due to the fact that the negotiated end was supposed to be between equals, but suddenly they were clearly not equals. Third, Russian economic weakness in the 90s led to further Russian backsliding in status compared to the US and Russian popular dissolution with liberalization. Relations with Russia improved in the early 2000s under Putin especially following 9/11 and the US invasion of Afghanistan (no one in the world liked the Taliban other than Pakistan). Relations soured again after the invasion of Iraq in 2003. During this time Russia experienced economic growth due to resource exportation due to China basically vacuuming up all natural resources on the market. Relations hit a nadir following the Russo-Georgian War in 2008. Relations between the US and Russia improved under Obama and Medvedev, but soured again following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea in 2014. Relations have continued to deteriorate to the current day. 

In regards to your thoughts about ""three powers in the Western world"", it doesn't hold much water. US relations with other Anglo countries are strong, but so are US relations with France and Germany. The European continent might form a counterbalance to the US, but they are not opposed or antipathetic. 

As for Russia, China, and North Korea. The latter is a wild card and the former faces a number of structural issues moving forward (though it is effectively using the tools currently at its disposal to insulate its power brokers from outside scrutiny). China is important going forward and hopefully they continue to buy into the international system rather than try to create a parallel one that could bifurcate the world.

So, in the US military, you normally have different uniforms.  I kinda thought that other countries did the same.

* Combat uniform: what people wear in the field, while deployed.  Usually camo.

* Service uniform: Office wear for people who work on office tasks.  Looks more like standard workwear.

There are even two ages possible in traditional writings, one of which is 14 and the other is 6. When I look into it more I've read a few jurists (mostly recent) who put her age at marriage anywhere from 10 to 20. For my personal belief I think she couldn't have been that young considering she participated in raids two years after her marriage. But she couldn't have been too old if she wasn't yet pubescent when she married.


It's kind of a debated issue in Islam because age wasn't precisely recorded in those times in Arabia and child marriage wasn't uncommon.

Why they did this ? Because at the start of WWII there were a number of territories where Germans were a sizeable minority or a local majority in a country, and national-socialists used it as a pretext to justify their territorial claims.

The visit to Poland for the German 65-year-old has ended poorly. The police wanted him to issue a fine for drinking alcohol in a forbidden place. The German first fussed and then tried to bribe them. Now he faces ... 10 years in prison.

On March 30, in the afternoon, the Slubice police wanted to punish with the mandate  a 65-year-old German citizen who was drinking alcohol in a prohibited place. Unfortunately, during his activities, German began using vulgar words towards officers. In connection with these offenses, **the police decided that he would have to pay mandate of 200 zlotys (50 Euro).**

This is not the end of the 65-year offenses. At some point, he came up with the idea to buy out of his felony and **tried to give a policeman a bribe of ... 10 euros.** And the consequences are much more serious.

 The 65-year-old was arrested in police custody.

Bad at moving quickly in snow, hated the cold, some guy saying that the US winter gear wasn't warm enough, etc.

In fairness, I seem to recall that at least some were Scandinavians or Canadians doing training of US soldiers, and some of those US soldiers may not have spent much or any time in snow prior to that point.  It doesn't really snow in Florida…

4984,"&gt;The separatists dont even have a majority in votes (while they just barely have it in parliament seats). The catalan parliament moves that lead to october 1 were an absolutly embarrasing shitshow involving passing illegal laws with half-empty parliament sessions and votes. Clearly not comparable to Scotland, no more than Texas lol.

They had enough support to have the regional government push for an independence referendum. That is very comparable to Scotland and not at at all comparable to Texas. 

&gt;before a 3rd referendum took place that would have presumably favored secession.

No it wouldn't have. Support died after the separatism lost a fair vote twice in a relatively short period of time. That's the only way to actually kill a separatist movement in a democratic country. If support were to ever rise again in Quebec then the national government allowing another vote would be the only real long term chance they had at keeping Quebec.

&gt;Its also interesting that your defence on the US hangs on a thread, if in the near future the federal govt fails to allow any regional referendum initiatives that may rise in popularity then according to you the US will cease to be a democracy.

Now you're speculating what if's about the future and arguing against those made up things?

But I'll say this and maybe this make you understand. If a serious separatist movement did grow in a US state and approached the level of Scotland or Catalonia then allowing the state to vote on it would be the only way for the US to keep control of the state in a democratic manner. Either you let them vote and hope they stay democratically or prepare to begin treating them more and more as an occupied territory. 

&gt;But in the end all I wanted to point out is that Spain is a democracy beyond the shadow of a doubt, you claiming otherwise is almost as ridiculous as insulting

You have completely and entirely missed the point of everything I said because you are perceiving everything as an insult. The point is Spain will not be able to hold Catalonia long term through democratic means unless the region is allowed to vote on independence. Ignoring the serious separatist movement and not allowing a vote will only increase it's support.

Evangelicals are as Christian as any other sect. The Church refers to the Vatican, you know Roman Catholic over here. I also don't think the Patriarchs of the Orthodox Churches campaign women beating either,

&gt; Have you ever considered the Muslim nutjobs equal the Christian nutjobs and the majority of Muslims has the same stance on such stuff as normal mainstream Christians have?

Don't change the narrative. I will agree with you if you say the same about the other religion. I will say not all Muslims are at fault, there are certain very influential ultra conservative sectors of the Muslim faith that are at fault.  

&gt;  But literally one sentence later you suggest its possible to make a generalizing claim about muslims. 

Because you made one first idiot. The amount of mental gymnastics to hate one Abrahamic faith and then vigorously defend another one is outstanding. You hate religion, fine, just apply it equally to all of them.

**The UK**

The UK punches above her weight economically, but she's significantly-smaller than China or the US or, if counted as a unit, the EU.  She's currently in the process of pulling out of the EU, which many people (including myself) will tend to weaken her.  We'll need to wait to see what she decides to do.  My guess is that she'll tend to be more active with the Commonwealth and probably with the US than she has been, but to retain fairly-loose formal associations.  I will be surprised if she withdraws to a corner of world affairs.

The Commonwealth used to be a pretty potent force, but was really just hanging together through World War II, when she had to deal with a lot of simultaneous pressures.  India isn't really in ""the club"" and was a big part of what made the British Empire tick.  Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are all wealthy, developed, land-rich, and aligned in many ways, but they have a smaller population and economy.

An additional wrinkle is that to some extent, the US displaced the UK as being the ""big"" member, especially in interacting with Canada (who, due to geography, is somewhat forced into alignment).  For various reasons, the UK relied on Singapore and other locations in East Asia to act as bases for naval power.  World War II went badly for her, and the US had to pick up a large part of the coverage.

The UK has built herself a her own fairly-impressive set of alliances and agreeements, and has a foot in a lot of camps and countries: she is the main other country to act with the US on the international stage, is a leading EU member (though this will change), has old British Empire ties and a fair amount of cultural influence and soft power via various mechanisms.

Militarily, I'd say that the UK looks a lot like a smaller US.  She is a nuclear power with second strike capability with a focus on naval and air power that [can fight off any other country]( https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/pp4evv/we-asked-a-military-expert-if-all-the-worlds-armies-could-shut-down-the-uk) and has pushed her resources into ability to project military power.  She has a fairly strategic set of airbases around the world.  She cannot act against countries as easily as the US could, but she could hamstring most via destroying shipping, power plants, and similar, even without having to dig into her manpower pool.

I expect that militarily, she and the US will be aligned for at least another twenty years, just in that the US has another twenty years until a World War II agreement to share bases with the UK ends.  In practice, my guess is that the two will probably operate together for some time past that.  The UK has also gone out of her way to maintain good military relations and alliance with the other European military powers and does military projects with them.

In World War II, the UK and the Commonwealth aligned with the US on intelligence in what became known as the [Five Eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes).  The Commonwealth does a good bit of intelligence work, but the US also tends to be tied in.

The UK is not astoundingly resource-rich.  Her assets, like Japan, are really in her people, and she has made good use of them, technology, and her economic and diplomatic arrangements.

Her fertility rate is nearly identical to that of the US, and I expect her to adopt somewhat-similar immigration strategy, maybe with India, maybe with less unskilled immigration.

The monarchy is more of a symbolic thing.  Yes, technically the Queen has great power in the UK, but in practice, she probably would simply not be listened to if she tried to take dramatic action.  She has been eased out of power — the UK is really a *de facto* republic today.  The Queen is also the head of state in a number of countries, but again, this is mostly symbolic.  I believe that the main reason she is retained is because she permitted herself to be phased out of power peacefully in the UK and in Commonwealth countries, and so she is well-respected.  She is wealthy and has built a niche for herself, but like the other royal families remaining in Europe, she really is not the one controlling things any more.

Legally, the UK (well, England), Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are fairly similar.  The US branched off a long time ago and had more-radical views on reform at the time, so looks somewhat more different in laws, Canada is considerably closer to the UK than US.  However, if you compare any of their laws and legal traditions, they look reasonably similar compared to, say, those of Germany.  Many rights look similar: changing someone's name or discarding debt is relatively easy, severity of punishments tend to be somewhat-similar, and so forth.  All would be considered to be reasonably economically-liberal.  The US tends to be the furthest-right economically, but Australia has some remarkably right positions socially.

Politically, the Commonwealth uses a [parliamentary system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_system) that is also common in Europe.  The US, as you note, uses a [presidential system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_system), like much of the Americas.

Australia, Canada, and the US are all 
[federations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation), so all have a sort of sub-country-level state that has extensive guaranteed political powers on which the central government may not infringe.  The UK and US both have political structure that is called a [two-party system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-party_system): this usually means a stable, centrist government that does not make major policy shifts from election to election, as it is extremely difficult for extremist parties to come to power.

Sorry for the focus on the US here, but it's what I think of the UK in terms of.

As best I can tell from Brexit material, the UK is planning on a much greater focus on the Pacific Rim economy, so you may be hearing more about the UK in China.

Aside from Brexit, I believe that the UK is in a fairly stable situation.  A major fight with the EU or US would be bad, but neither seem likely to me in the near future.  She has perhaps the most extensive history of any country of conducting international affairs, and that's part of what she's betting on her ability to do.  She will probably be involved in world affairs, but in the near term, she will not drive them directly in the way that the US does, China could, and the EU likely will increasingly do (of course, she just arranged a broad international reaction to Russia, so who knows…)

5017,"&gt;I think the best move would be to disallow foreign funding of religious institutions.

This has been said for years and years, and it's never done. Maybe because no one wants to stand up to Saudi Arabia, maybe because funds could still be disseminated by ''private'' donors. Even if there was a good solution, it's not even clear how much it would help, given that radicalism can be spread on the internet instead. Also, how much international support and funding do these ''enlightened'' muslims have?

&gt;Hard to say. I take it that you agree that more should be done here? Education is the only way to solve this problem long term.

You think you're some revolutionary for suggesting that? You think it's not been tried? Peers and parents are much more important in forming a worldview than anything you get told in school.

Yes, but if they are shitty bigoted views, I'd rather they not live in the same country or continent as me. While we can't legally do anything about homegrown bigots, immigrants can and should be kicked out if they follow a religion that has values that are antithetical to egalitarianism.

Turkification i think is mostly related to heritage and language. Religion also plays a a role but there are christian Turks called Karamanlides. They're from Central Anatolia. They speak Turkish and identify as Turkish but they're Orthodox. So religion does not essentially play a huge role in Turkification.

Also i'd not say ""Greeks"". Anatolian """"""Greeks"""""" were/are barely Greek.

**The EU**

The EU is an international union that is, in my eyes, likely headed to ultimately become one country; in the near term, she will keep moving incrementally-closer to that goal.

The EU is something of a wildcard for me, the biggest variable.  One can predict a lot of what the US might do, but the EU depends greatly on internal politics: whether it will break up — as, in part, it has with Brexit — continue on, or stall in integration.

The EU consists of many historically-often-hostile countries that are, for the first time ever, engaging in mass peaceful unification.

Each individual country is often wealthy, well-educated, and quite developed.  However, they have been tremendously handicapped by always acting against each other and needing to worry about other nearby countries acting against them.  They have historically had a number of different languages, but are adopting English for interchange now; I believe that they trail China in language integration but lead India.

In aggregate, if treated as one unit, the EU is at the top level of world economic entities, on par with the US and still somewhat larger than China.  She is not structured, today, to leverage that power very effectively; this can be expected to change.

Militarily, the EU consists of many countries that, in aggregate, were historically overwhelmingly strong, but have dramatically-reduced their military capabilities since the end of the Cold War.  France and the UK are the major powers at the momwnt.  If necessary, especially given some time, the EU could probably do some reasonable power projection, but aside from France, the UK, and I believe Italy, have militaries not really oriented towards it.

The EU faces several major issues today.  She has not jelled as a single country yet.  Her member countries are those that have some of the lowest birth rates around the world, and many have had very low birth rates for a long time; this makes it hard for her to maintain her population.  Some of her economies are very wealthy and productive, and others are less-so, often due to the effects of the Cold War.  She can expect to see very large migration — I understand that the same has been and is true of China — as people move to large population centers.  Her central government cannot act with as free a hand as, say, China's central government can, or members will choose to leave, which they have a right to do.

Her legal and political traditions are varied, but *tend* to be parliamentary multiparty syatems using a similar set of legal conventions.

My guess is that her next stage of interest, aside from her own integration, will be in acquiring influence in Africa, especially northern and western, where France has taken a substantial involvement.

&gt;*A grave and hardened state of sin.* Here we are addressing the cause that today,
unfortunately, is on the increase, with a resulting increase in the numbers of people who
are victims of the devil. At the root, the true cause is always a lack of faith. As lack of
faith increases, so does superstition; it is almost a mathematical reality. I believe that the
Gospel gives us a clear example of this in the character of Judas. He was a thief. Who
knows how many times Jesus tried to correct him and call him to repentance, and the only
result was rejection and a hardening in sin. Judas reaches the climax when he asks the
chief priests, “What are you prepared to give me, if I hand him over to you?” (Mt 26:15).
In the narrative of the Last Supper, the Gospel tells us that terrible sentence about Judas:
“Then after the morsel, Satan entered into him” (Jn 13:27). I have no doubt that here it
means true diabolic possession.

&gt;In the current environment, where we are witnessing the collapse of the family, I have
encountered many cases of possessed people who, in addition to other sins, were living in
irregular marriages. I have dealt many times with women whose sins included the crime of
abortion. I have been confronted with numerous people who, in addition to sexual
aberrations, committed other violent actions. Many times I have been faced with
homosexuals who were drug addicts and who had committed drug-related sins. It is almost
redundant to say that, in all these stages, the way to healing can begin only with a sincere
conversion.",,/r/europe/comments/89rrvd/percentage_of_people_who_visit_religious_services/dwtxvi2/,[deleted],1522895072

The final cord was severed in the 1980s when Australia, Canada and NZ repatriated their constitutions so that they could modify them without asking the UK for permission. Until the 1980s though, Canadian or Aus passports still said ""British and Australian subject"" but now have been updated to just Canadian or Australian, and instead of subject they say citizen (British passports said subjects too, we changed it to citizens at the same time as them). They are 100% independent now, the monarchy is considered separate too (the Queen is Queen of Canada when in Canada, a totally different position from Queen of the UK, for example.

5112,"Canada relies on the US for its protection most of the time. Australia recently have been pushing for increased American help due to the Chinese take over that's happening there. 

The relationship between the US and majority of the EU member countries is overall positive at least on the outside, but there's some conflict of interests happening behind the scenes. The US is using NATO as the extension of the US influence over Europe and an effective tool to keep Russia out of picture. I mean Russia cannot be trusted due to its subversive tendencies, but sometimes the West goes a bit over the board with the fear mongering. Obviously, Russia is the biggest gas exporter in the region, but Americans are trying to take over the European market with its liquefied natural gas. 

Russia has a terrible reputation in the region due to an illegal take over of Crimea.  Russia had a deal with Ukraine a few decades ago stating that Ukraine would give up its nuclear weapons in exchange for Crimea. Now Russia has to deal with the sanctions due to their illegal take over of Crimea. Of course, Putin organised fake elections to support the narrative that people living there wanted to join Russia,  but, obviously, no one bought it. I mean even the last presidential elections were a complete joke and most countries had expressed their distaste with ""Russian democracy.""

Regardless of how harsh certain areas of the front were, the Germans still largely steamrolled the USSR. Even the first battle of Smolensk was a terrible defeat for the Soviets. The opening stages of Operation Barbarossa were largely a German success.

&gt;Yes Im sure US did send millions of tons of help in 1941. Oh wait... the ammount of help sent was 1.4% of domestic production of USSR

Like I said before, it's not how much was sent, it's what was sent. We provided materials that required skilled labor. Even without the finished goods we produced, our refined materials kept Soviet industry afloat. I'd recommend reading the post-war memoirs of General Georgy Zhukov to get a good account of just how vital the US was.

The majority of their industrial as well as food growing areas were occupied until relatively late in the war. Massive amounts of American food aid averted a likely famine in 42-43. German air power was largely destroyed on the western front which allowed the Soviets to achieve air supremacy on the eastern front which allowed Operation Bagration to be such a success- not to mention that at the time a large battle was taking place in Normandy which required many of the Germans best divisions.

5400,"I think that this is gonna turn into a general left-wing/right-wing fight, which is going to go nowhere.

If you want interesting ""tax model"" differences between the EU and US, here are a couple that I think are more-likely-to produce fruitful discussion:

* The US tends to cause taxation to vary more between those with higher salaries and those with lower salaries.  However, the US also does relatively little by way of government spending towards the poor.  So the US tends to shift its progressivity to the taxation side, and the EU to the spending side.  In the US, more tax revenue tends to come from income tax, which places more burden on the upper middle class and less on the poor.  In the EU, tax revenue tends to come more from consumption taxes like VAT, which hit the poor harder.

    Because of this, the US also has a notoriously-complicated tax code, since that's where the special interests go.  Artists don't get a $10 grant: artists get a $10 tax break.

* The US has two more-or-less separate tax systems — state and federal.  I mail two separate forms, one to my state tax authority, one to my national tax authority.  The EU has a single tax scheme and instead seeks to have the EU impose limits on what the state does.

* The US taxes American citizens abroad if they make more than a certain amount and are paying less taxes.  No EU member does this.  Americans also are required to pay towards Social Security when abroad and have a US-wide pool.  Today, the fact that people in the EU don't do that is an externality that causes defunding of state pension systems when people move within the EU.

* The US has an extremely high corporate tax rate, but has many loopholes to structure a company to limit it.

* In the US, it is common for states to compete for large companies by bidding on tax breaks  to get them to locate there.  My understanding is that this is illegal in the EU and would count as state aid.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/89r3rg/thoughts_on_the_european_model_of_taxation/dwsyzz8/,vokegaf,1522863247

5418,"There have honestly been so many political surprises over the last few years (not least Brexit) that I think trying to predict the future is a bit of a fool’s game. I can talk in probabilities: there are lots of ways it could go: if it continues on the rails it’s currently on, the UK will probably get some kind of loose free trade agreement that doesn’t really do much on services (the vast majority of the British economy) but which lets us trade goods pretty freely. Immigration will probably be fairly controlled, the UK will mostly be able to deviate from EU regulations but still have to keep an eye on things. 

But other things could happen. If Labour wins the next election, we could have a closer relationship with the EU - certainly staying in the customs union, and maybe (though they haven’t quite said it) some kind of relationship with the single market akin to at least Ukraine, maybe closer. Or the Tory party could implode under the contradictions of Brexit and something absolutely wild could happen. The whole thing could be called off given some kind of unforeseeable surprise or a sharp change in public opinion.

I honestly don’t know how any of these will affect public opinion about Brexit. I suspect the most likely deal won’t live up to people’s expectations, but when that happens will they blame Brexit itself? Or the government for not doing it properly? Or the EU for not playing ball and hate it even more? It depends how politicians play it and how the media that people who currently support Brexit read plays it.

How Brexit will affect how the UK sees itself is a really interesting question. I think it will be quite polarising. Already for some Remainers, the idea that actually, Britain needs to be in a family of nations and isn’t an empire any more, is taking root, and you hear it a lot more than you did before the referendum.

So when they strike it should be a net gain to society, as they won't get paid. But since you said

&gt; It's pure rent seeking and a net loss to society.

You imply that they are under-paid right now. 

&gt; A way of determining this would be to reduce/eliminate transfer payments from the French government to the rail system and let the price find itself. 

How ? 

&gt; If the rail system was cut off from government funding it would collapse. This indicates a problem.

Why ? The French railways were nationalised I think after the private corporations failed. 

&gt; Really, the trains don't need to be owned and operated by the state at all. They can be operated in private competition as rail transit is not a real monopoly in the same way that the tracks are.

That generally just ends up with shitty quality and under-investment.

The intellectuals of the new state wanted a language more closely related to what the ancient Greeks (or even the Byzantines) were speaking. So they constructed katharevousa, a language which could with a little effort be understood by the Greeks of that period, but used a lot of Ancient Greek words, or neologisms based on Ancient Greek words, to replace the loan words from the aforementioned languages. So for Switzerland they used the name of the tribes residing in that region in Late antiquity, the Helvetes.

5513,"We were recovering already in the late 90's, the agenda actually made it worse because it further damaged the domestic market (give people less money and they will buy less and the economy will do worse), we can see the excact same phenomenon in Greece where likewise the domestic market actually got worse, austerity measures like that do not work. In Germany we used our new situation with low wages and relatively high productivity to build up a predatory export sector (which a lot of other countries hate us for).

Short question: Which country has the largest surplus and which country has the largest deficit? Germany and the US (yes, we have a larger surplus than China, not per capita but total). Next question: Why do you think Trump wants to go into trade war with us? Economically speaking we're absolutel dicks, not the people, they get paid worse than they should, but our political course. The really big problem with the Agenda was not necesarilly the Agenda itself but that we've been in Agenda mode for 15 years now. We've never counteracted the wage stagnation from the Agenda years, in fact we actually expanded that crap by having the lowest inflation in all of the EU (going considerably below the common EU goal of 1,9 %) in the period from the Agenda up until now (this means effectively our wages increased slower) and thus our wages are effectively lower than comparable economies like France which is also the reason France has high unemployment, while ours is fairly moderate. And in this case we're the dicks with predatory economic reforms that undermine workers rights and the frenchies are the good guys that did everything right but now they're fucked over and because they have no other choice, Macron is doing reforms not unsimilar to the Agenda now, so we're spreading the low wage sector all across Europe.

They are not being paid when they are on strike. If their *service* is worth less than they are paid, them being on strike would be a net benefit to society, do you not agree ? If their service is worth *more* than they are being paid, the strike and not paying them will still be a net loss.

No, the point of a union is solidarity and protecting worker's rights. If the service those in the Union provide is not worth it, one could just stop financing the industry.

Thats not the case in the US either. Each state defines its own history curriculum, yet i dont want a federation like in the US. Germany was just 1 out of 2 examples i gave, so who here is using a strawman? Not me. 

The distinct difference being that a union of nations is that the nations are still sovereign independent nations under 1 union, and a federation is a federation of states that arent sovereign.

I will not relinquish my countries hard fought independence and sovereignity just because the EU succeeded to exist in peace for 2 to 3 generations. A much more extensive foundation is needed for me to make that jump. A foundation that wont be formed by our generation nor my childrens generation.

If i look at other countries within the EU i never see a national culture, mindset or tradition im jealos of. Im not being arrogant, but its the simple truth. I dont look up to a country like Romania or Spain (Or Sweden or Denmark for that matter). Im very much satisfied with how we are dealling things in the Netherlands right now. I dont feel a duty to pay for French healthcare. I dont feel entitled to Bulgarian funding to Dutch infrastructure. I never will. 

When i see the high levels of corruption in places like Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria but even a place like France is relatively corrupt compared to my country. Im not willing to surrender my countries sovereignity to ''better'' Europe, so to speak. For that to even happen the EU needs to be stable for generations to come and other countries to become a lot less corrupt and appreciate simple aspects of a democracy like the trias politica, something thats being violated right now in Poland, only like 25 years after it became a democracy.

And its not like other Europeans are entitled to expect that from me. I dont owe them my countries sovereignity. Especially not if you consider the Dutch citizen is the citizen that contribute the most (by far) towards the EU budget. Macron nor Merkel deserve a excuse for me to not give up Dutch sovereignity. 

I will not relingquish the sovereignity of my country to gamble it on the European project. I owe that to my children and their children.

5589,"&gt;If you go to the bottom of this BRÅ page, you'll find this Excel-file of statistics stretching all the way back to 1950, where you can see the horrendous upward trend we have in Sweden.

You must remember that this is reported crimes, which is not the same as actual crimes. The murder rate for instance is actually lower per capita than 20-25 years ago, in real numbers the highest number of murders was in the end of the 80s when it was over 120, while at the same time we had 1.5 million less inhabitants.

As for rapes, notice that it rose by 45% alone in 2005? That's when the law was changed as to what a rape is. Therefore it's not a good practice to compare straight on with 20 years ago.

But you might say, it has risen 74% since 2005! And that's true, but again, that's reported crimes. And I'm not saying it hasn't increased, it probably has. But current research suggests that sexual crimes are heavily under reported. And I think you can agree that for every year we hear more and more talk about equality, violence against women etc. And let's not forget #metoo.

5597,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_rent

&gt;If their service is worth less than they are paid, them being on strike would be a net benefit to society, do you not agree 

The service they provide is valuable, of course.  The administration believes that the reduction in rent is more valuable than the lost productivity from the strike and waiting it out will lead to long term economic benefits.  Otherwise they would not do so.

&gt;the point of a union is solidarity and protecting worker's rights

I was not referring to the union in general but the purpose of the strike.  They oppose this reduction in benefits, and they're using their right to deny their labor.  This is their right, just as it's the government's right to bargain back.

&gt;Let the free market provide alternatives. 

It should and it will.  That should include an alternative to the striking worker's labor.

&gt;workers have much more of a right to seek rent

Public sector employees have less of a right to seek rent than private employees.  This is because the state has granted a monopoly to the public service, creating a union monopoly for workers in the field.  Workers in government-granted monopolies have a larger social responsibility.  This gives the workers significantly more power than they would have in a competitive market in which reduced efficiency would be checked by closer-to-perfect competition.",Live Free or Die,/r/europe/comments/89bt8o/psa_if_you_travel_to_france_there_is_a_major/dwsr40a/,thebowski,1522856763

5602,"Small side note, an interesting talk on the classical style of writing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV5J6BfToSw

You don't need to watch it to understand what I'm saying, but the basic takeaway is that, when I accuse a class of something I don't accuse every single one of them, just the vast majority, but specifying exceptions all the time ,when they don't really change the point being discussed, is cumbersome to the reader and irrelevant. I'm sure there's a small amount of sociologists and political scientists and even the rare macro-economists or MBA that understand fundamental mathematics (I'm not so sure about ""gender scientists"" or ""feminist studies"" or other such disciplines, it may be that the statement actually holds in an absolute way for those creatures).

Semantics aside:

I wouldn't say that's an unreasonable claim. There are many cases in history where a class of people which claimed to understand something knew nothing about it, some good examples of these are doctors in the 19th century (claimed to understand how the human body works), politicians in communist parties around the world (claimed to understand how an economy and human societies works), the priesthoods of various religions (claimed to be able to predict the future based on a completely subjective ""process"" called ""divine revelation"") and pythagorean scholars (claimed understanding of geometrical problems when their proof would only hold true in a world where all numbers are rational). 

These were all large groups of people that commended respect in based on their societies on their knowledge of a subject, but, turns out, did not hold that knowledge.

I would say that, based on historical evidence, the fact that a majority of people believe someone has some piece knowledge does not make that true. If you have a study that proves people in these disciplines do posses knowledge about fundamental mathematics (not a fully objective issue, but it can be measured via having these individuals reason about and solve certain problems), I would be willing to read it, even admit it's truth and retract the statement. Until then, I will keep my assumption that, since these people aren't required to understand fundamental mathematics by their profession, (you could even argue they have to lack understanding of math, to be able to eat their own bullshit) they will not.

But I kinda think that you focusing on me insulting the researches rather than on my explaining why such research is wrong (namely the fact that it can't be falsified) is a kind of strawman argument.

Wouldn't you rather focus on my main (and only relevant) point and try to explain me how this kind of research can claim to have valid results despite the nature of the results it aims to produce ? ",,/r/europe/comments/89nnlx/media_literacy_index_2018/dwsih50/,elcric_krej,1522848874

5619,"&gt; Yes we can vote for the MEPs, but it's not an iota as clear which comission president candidate any given MEP, party or party group supports. 

That has changed recently with the Spitzenkandidaten agreement: you now know beforehand which candidate Commission President everyone supports.

&gt;Furthermore there is absolutely zero chance for the people of Europe to be able to get rid of the president at all. Conversely, if the UK government is failing, then they can be removed in a GE or by a vote of no confidence or loss of a budget vote. 

The EP can force the Commission to resign. It actually already did once. They also vet the candidate commissioners before thet are approved, and that's not a formality: they reject a few every year.

&gt;I hate, hate, hate to be agreeing with Nigel Farage, but he was absolutely right when he asked Herman Von Rompuy who he was, who voted for him, and what mechanism there is to get rid of him. And that point stands to this day.

The heads of state of the EU members appointed him. So the national states are to blame for it.

&gt;As for the commissioners, there the result of each state having their own unique democratic systems but needing to all equally have one commissioner, resulting in the power to choose them being given to the state governements. I would argue that EU Commissioners should be elected by the people of their countries, not appointed by their governements. 

Well, that would amount to a reduction of power of the national governments. Farage would oppose that.

I don't see it as particularly problematic that the executive power is not directly elected: it's not the case in many countries either. It leaves the option for the elected parliament to appoint an expert for a specific task or project. Furthermore, elected executives gives the impression that it's a promotion from ordinary MEP, and that's wrong: being a MEP is a valuable career on its own to strive for, people shouldn't do it for the change to become commissioner. It also avoids that the people who are the most powerful in a party grab the ministers posts and then will never be removed because their party keeps supporting them - because they make those decisions too.

Well, then that's too bad. Thankfully we can always wage guerrilla warfare which would be too costly for Russia in the long run... If we don't do that, then we deserve to get annexed. 

&gt;If they attacked the whole NATO maybe they would be stopped before reaching Warsaw.

If Russia decides to attack NATO, they have already decided to win. That means they have organized their whole society to the war effort and their tanks would be built with fucking slave labor if necessary... 

&gt;You are vastly underestimating the 2nd strongest military power in the world.

No I'm not. I think the West is when they blindly trust Russia would NEVER attack NATO and that's why NATO keeps Europe in peace for the next millennium... 

But the thing is, Russia would never attack a tiny country like Finland with full force. They would only attack with enough troops to defeat ours... And if that attack is repelled, is it worth it to attack again? 

&gt;You blame Ukraine for being attacked because its people wanted to remove the Russian puppet president and wanted to themselves choose their allies?

It's bad politics, and now Ukraine lost Crimea and part of the Eastern Ukraine... Worth it? 

When you neighbor a country the size of Russia, it's naive to think you can do whatever the fuck you want and expect them to forever respect your sovereignty. Who in their right mind thought it's a good idea to aspire joining NATO when Russia has a fucking naval base in Crimea? 

The issue with Ukraine is that they couldn't balance between Russian influence and Western influence. They just had to pick one over the other... Ukraine has always been a divided country between Ukrainian speaking West and Russian speaking East. On the other hand Yanukovych just couldn't appease the Western part by being too aligned towards Russia, on the other hand, he was replaced by people whom many were Ukrainian ultranationalists and wanted to join NATO... The separatism in Eastern Ukraine didn't come out of thin air, it came when people were opposed to their new illegal government and Russia took advantage of that.

&gt; Things aren't nearly so rosy for Scandinavia as they were in the 80s and 90s.  I'll admit a small amount of satisfaction with that, which would be greater were it not for the enormous tragi-comedy attendant on your denial of what your Leftist state ultimately delivered for your people.  

Lol'd, Sweden is a great place. As well is all of Scandinavia. If I had the chance to be born today in any country I'd choose between Scandinavia, Switzerland or Canada. 

You have been waiting for Scandinavia to be humbled for a long time? Well then you must be disappointed because Scandinavia is punching way above its weight and is thriving in many ways if you look at all sorts of indices. Sweden took in too many refugees during the refugee crisis and has an integration problem, apart from that it's amazing to live here and what we get from our taxes. Now Sweden has one of the strictest immigration policies in Europe, due to the backlash, and that is with the Social Democrats in power.

5668,"&gt;Are you claiming our official statistics lie that almost all types of against-person and gang-related crime is on the rise in Sweden?

Did we read the same report?  Most crimes against person, including assault, is either stable or going down. Sexual crimes is the big exception, and last year there was a new crime regarding unlawful use of identity that lead to a rise.

&gt;The last time BRÅ kept records of the difference between Swedes and foreign-born people in crime, immigrants had an overrepresentation of 5.5 times for rape.

5.0 times, but ok. Children of immigrants are ""only"" have an overrepresentation in rape by 1.8 times. In general the report found  immigrants to be 2.5 times more likely to be registered for a crime, those born in Sweden with immigrant parents 2.0 times more likely, and with one immigrant parent 1.4 times more likely.

However, compare that with the group of people living in a family that has had social welfare (socialbidrag) compared with those who haven't and it's a factor of 6.1. 

Or those with only primary education and those with a three year university/college education and it's a factor of 5.7.

Immigrants are more likely to be poor and have low education. I think we could draw some more nuanced conclusions.

It's not helped by media fueling the depiction, but that's on both sides.

Nevermind the refugee stuff and, so forth.

FWIW, on that topic at least the rape rate being high, as I understand it is a combination of,

1) It's got a high reporting rate. Rape tends to be underreported in general.

5766,"Ok, I'm gonna stop all of you ""OMFG WHAT ARE THEY DOING"" people right here.  
Firstly, this post title is abhorent. Nowhere is it stated that gender pronouns are sexist or that it's the reason they're ""banned"". Teachers are encouraged to reffer to students as a whole, as ""friends"". Also a funny fact about sweeden:  
  
&gt;A gender-neutral pronoun, “hen,” was introduced in 2012 and was swiftly absorbed into mainstream Swedish culture, something that, linguists say, has never happened in another country.  
  
So stop being silly.  
  
Second, ctrl+f ""punish"". 0 rezults. There's nothing about punishment.  
  
&gt;Exactly how this teaching method affects children is still unclear.  
  
This is the consensus. And honestly, this kind of thing is good. Most of modern behavioral biology has its knowledge base only thanks to these scandinavian countries. No one else dares do this because they're so stuck in their ""norms"".  
  
If you're on the ""its against biology"" train, then you're in the wrong place. Activity prefference isn't proven 100% in biology. Because ""environmental influence"" begins in the womb, not at birth. Many people miss this fact.  
  
In short, I'm happy that someone is doing this. This might be one big step in actually figuring out how gender roles function and we might get a proper answer to all the questions about their importance. Because so far it's either one side shouting it's ""against biology"" or the other that it's ""abusive and gender constructs need to vanish"".

 &gt;...because they were willing to put capitalism before democracy. Did you even listen to what I wrote? It was about putting forward an imperative for the future, and the ""mistake"" of dictatorships was later rectified, was it not?

Precisely - ""they were willing to put capitalism over democracy."" Which kinda answers why people are sour about US in Europe dont you think? US sends troops around globe due to capitalism first and foremost with democracy making fine excuse for that.

&gt;Yes, because it was either that or lose to the Communists. A Capitalist dictator was better than a Communist one.

Whats the difference? Firing squad or hanging surely leave same trail of corpses conducted in the name capitalism or communism.

&gt;I thought dictatorships were bad?

They are - and their support by *democratic* country makes said country look as bad as them. 

&gt;Why? Iraq invaded Kuwait, an American ally. They were involved as soon as Iraqi troops crossed the border.

Well thats a new one - Iraq invading Kuwait in 2003.

Because the Cold War was about Capitalism and Communism. You cannot compromise on that. You *can* compromise on democracy if required, it is not inherent to Capitalism.


&gt;Which kinda answers why people are sour about US in Europe dont you think?


No, because Europe was never under dictatorship after the US liberated it with Britain. This is largely a French creation, after De Gaulle insisted it be portrayed as the French doing the liberating with the Allies merely helping. That, and European elitism.


But, regardless, Europeans have no right to belittle others when their history filled with millions of dictators.

Now considering that a lot of people of that region use it as a way to go to work and come back, 10 euros gone. Average daily pay ? Not even 15 euros. So you get the picture.
