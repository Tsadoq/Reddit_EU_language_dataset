&amp;#x200B;

Washington is pushing the Polish government to forbid the 5G communication network from Huawei to China, writes The New York Times. The creation of a permanent base of US troops called ""Fort Trump"" is to be dependent on the fulfillment of this condition.

&amp;#x200B;

The plan for building ""Fort Trump"" President Andrzej Duda presented during his visit to the USA in September 2018. Meanwhile, the findings of the NYT show that the officials of President Donald Trump directly suggested the dependence of US troops deployment in Poland on the exclusion of the construction of the fifth generation Chinese network Huawei giant.

&amp;#x200B;

The American authorities treat the activities of the Chinese concern in Europe as part of a new arms race. The technology used by Huawei in the construction of the fifth generation network is recognized by the Trump administration as a threat to the security of the country. The US services believe that the Chinese company cooperates with the intelligence of this country, enabling it to enter the ""back door"" into telecommunications and computer networks of many countries.

&amp;#x200B;

NYT also resembles the speech of Colonel. Grzegorz Małecki, former head of the Foreign Intelligence Agency, who in the context of Huawei pointed to a possible threat from China for US troops stationed in Poland. The newspaper also recalled the recent detention by the former intelligence officer Piotr D. and Wang W., a Huawei employee on charges of espionage.

&amp;#x200B;

According to NYT, it was ""a brilliant example of how the Chinese government installs intelligence agents in Huawei's branches around the world"" for the US government.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/akwvhw/washington_puts_a_condition_on_poland_you_want_to/ef8l2tx/,Tartyron,1548739880

It's based on feels rather than reals.

We already share the same regulations, and a future trade agreement won't deviate much from those, that's pretty much guaranteed. So, in reality, not in the half-cooked fantasies of some hard Brexiteers, a backstop won't do much except prolonging the status quo into the future and make **everyone's** life much easier.

155,"&gt;This is just a way of saying ""gerrymandering"" but with more words

Only if you don't know what gerrymandering is, and are misrepresenting what representative democracies are. Britain is not a direct democracy, it is a representative democracy in which you elect and individual to represent you. That is only possible if there are actual representatives - the people you directly vote for rather then the monolith that is a particular party.

Theoretically I could support a parties ideology but truly not want a particular individual. Maybe I don't trust them, maybe there stances in the party I disagree with etc. 

Gerrymandering is to ""manipulate the boundaries of (an electoral constituency) so as to favour one party or class."" This has nothing to do with UKIP not getting a seat. They got relatively few votes in each district, whereas SNP got (virtually) all there votes in a far more concentrated area. 

&gt;The kind of representation youre discussing is achieved on more local levels of elections, which essentially almost every country has, like for example in the US you have state wide elections, county elections.

You can have this kind of representation at every level. In fact the US has it at every level. In federal elections people vote based on constituencies (which are also state bound), individuals can choose whether they like parties of course, but can also base it of the individual. They are not bound as a country to have one big pool of votes in which seats are distributed by the % of votes each party gets. They don't even do that when voting for president, as position in which only one person can claim, rather then the roughly 435 representatives (which are based basically on districts).

Australia, New Zealand (I believe also Canada) use this system.

&gt;Trying to argue that 12.5 % of the votes should only get 0.2 % seats, whilst another party with 4.7 % votes getting 8.6 % seats, is complete nonsense in national elections.

Why would this be more nonsense in national elections then in more localised, like state based ones? Some US states have bigger population then European countries? 

Either way it makes perfect sense to be able to directly choose who you want to represent you. To represent my electoral section, I might want a particular person. Want them to be directly lobbying on your behalf.

An example of this was the Division on Indi (federal division for national elections) in Victoria, Australia. She became a independent elected by the electors of Indi defeating the incumbent Liberal member. Her policies are basically just liberal party policies to be frank, however, the people of that area were more interested in her as a person representing them then the previous rep. 

This isn't gerrymandering, it isn't a bug. It is the entire point of the system. It allows individuals in a electorate far more say over who they want to represent them, and far more ability to pressure and push for specific polices compared to a proportional representative system in which one is virtually stuck to the policies demanded by the greater majority (who might not be agreed with on a smaller level).",,/r/europe/comments/akoa1x/ukip_literature_being_distributed_in_sussex_we/ef8b91d/,SavageJunk,1548732150

253,"&gt; I'd like to know more what they mean by the ""extremist movement within the AfD"" that they nonetheless not deem very important

For example groups and organizations inside the AfD that they say thing's like (I paraphrase) "".... we have to butter up the other parties for the time being, but when our time comes we will line them up in front of a wall ... ready the scaffold for the red-green vermin, up and down, up and down the guillotine goes ... dig a hole, cover them with chalk"". 

This wasn't said by a Neo-Nazi who accidentally appeared under a Facebook post, but by an MP in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, and he wasn't talking about the Antifa. He was talking about the established political parties. In all fairness it should be added that the AfD kicked him out since then, but only after they received widespread backlash for yet another such incident. That report is full of similar examples which they gathered from AfD the activities in social media AND official communication.

But it's not just that. It is also about people like Bernd Höcke, one of the leading figureheads of the AfD and leader of the (even by AfD standards) extremist faction ""The Wing"", who held a public speech in Dresden a while ago where he said that every nation needs a revolution and strong Führer from time to time, and he fantasized about a German Führer-Nation. Consequently he questions the historical relevance of the Holocaust, described the Holocaust memorials as a disgrace that no other country would erect in their cities in memory of their crimes and tragedies, and wants to get rid of the German ""remembrance culture"".

These are just some examples of the most extreme views that you will find even among leaders inside the AfD. Examples for their fascist and anti-democratic and anti-constitutional ideologies. As if saying things like ""... if necessary border patrols should have to shoot people"" wasn't extreme enough. What? Your right-wing filter bubble did not tell you about these things? You really had no idea until today? Who would have thought.

The AfD is not your average anti-immigration party. That would be the CSU (and if they would run nation wide and not just get dragged around with the larger CDU, the AfD would probably not exist). The AfD is a melting pot of all the nationalist to extremist views that you can imagine, including prominent politicians who want to go straight back to the Third Reich just without the war.


&gt; That Germany is at risk of extinction due to multiculturalism? It's not a risk, it's a certainty.

Germany had a prominent Muslim immigration since the 60s, and the Muslim population has been stable at five to six percent for decades. That figure includes everyone that can be counted towards the Muslim population, even people who might have been born to Muslim parents but never practiced their religion. The percentage of ""actual Muslims"" is even smaller than that, and the numbers are growing very slowly over time despite the occasional and since the 60s recurring influx if immigrants.

You alt-right nutjobs love to claim that Germany used to be a safe and flourishing country before the recent refugee crisis, and that the country is now going down the shitter because of that one decisions that Merkel and her government made in September 2015. None of that is true. Germany has always been a flourishing country since the beginning of the ""Wirtschaftswunder"", and it always had immigration with recurring waves of refugees. The economic indicators are good and constantly improving, the crime rates are low, remain low and overall continue to decline, and the Muslim population increases at such a low rate (if at all) that German population won't go extinct for another couple of centuries.

You will now probably want to claim that these numbers and indicators are all fake and part of a leftist conspiracy to remain in power and maybe even wipe out the German and European population (for whatever reason). Yes, maybe it's a conspiracy and where are the sheeples who are to dumb to see the truth. But if so then no one can know what is actually going on because the federal institutions, in this particular case the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, are the only ones who can produce hard data.

265,"&gt;Yes i would, but especially when it comes to direct democracy.

So how are people supposed to have their say in any democratic system? Surely people voting for the same people, or on the same issue for a variety of reasons is both normal and reasonable?!

&gt;What irks me is that many of the reasons people voted for are not necessarily the fault of the EU, many of the things are solvable trough internal politics, etc.

Absolutely, and many of the issues the EU faces are actually problems with the member states. Some of the structural issues are there because people didn't want to commit to the EU as a political project. But at the end of the day, the result is that people don't want to be part of the EU.

There are also other major points 1.
 The idea of 75% tax never works in pratice why since the rich people simply move and move their wealth outside the country. This means that you more or less try to push the real tax paying people even more but mostly end up with less. 
( Also make thier companies disadvantaged since they cant invest as much as other competiters with less taxes). 

Minium wage is something many want to raise but then you have to have the money to do it. 
 Witch the frenxh state dont have really. ( the dept you have is pretty high and is eating some 8?% of yearly gdp) aswell with the high unemploymet in France.  Most wage rises comes when unemployment is down since employes will increase wagw to find new emploies.

696,"&gt; And what is the better source than nuclear?

Nuclear is pretty okay as a transition technology. It's just that you can't listen to the reddit nuclear circle jerk without developing brain cancer. Germans afraid of tsunamis xD

&gt; Amount of energy produced by nuclear power plant is huge compared to same area covered by solar panels or wind turbines. 

Nuclear power is also extremely expensive if it wouldn't get a lot of hidden subsidies. Who pays for final disposal sites in most countries? While the plant operators pocket the profits, the tax payer pays for disposing nuclear waste.   

And for new operations they'll even started to negotiate direct subsidies. EDF wouldn't have agreed to Hinkley Point C if the British government wouldn't have guaranteed them a minimum strike price. Because EDF knows that renewables will become more cost effective in the 50 years projected runtime of Hinkley Point. 

&gt; And when you are done jerking to solar and wind awesomeness, tell me, how do you get large amounts of energy from north to south? Wouldn't it be that you use my country´s grid because you are unable to build your own connection? 

So people who are skeptical of nuclear power are now also responsible for NIMBY behavior? 

&gt; But of course it is too difficult to build new grid or God forbid stop your Nuclear scare and build actually reliable stable source. Oh no, much easier to use Protectorate for your dirty work.

But honestly what people are looking down upon (again this are all just my interpretations) is really, the indecisiveness of your gov. I think everyone can agree that this has been an unfathomable shitshow from start to (soon) finish, and what I personally think people look down upon is the whole sentiment of ""leaving but keeping the benefits of the trade union"", which from day1 of the EU in 1995 was clear that it's all or nothing, so it's really ""funny"" that it keeps coming up as something to negotiate.  
Which leads back to, since you can only get all or nothing, taking all just means you ""stay"" in the EU for practical purposes but lose your voting rights, which is really just a clearly worse position than you currently have, so why even leave?  
And if you take nothing it's a huge blow.

750,"&gt; Most of the French agree on basic things like the government should focus tax on the wealthiest ans cut some slack on working class in order to reduce inequalities. E. Macron did the opposite.

This is true, but only because you literally tried excessive taxes on the wealth a few years ago and it went badly. ""But like, let's try higher taxes on the rich again"" needs to stop at some point. Macron is correct in noting that your country needs to have some money in order for you to redistribute it.

 &gt; Most of the French want our government to fight against tax evasion &amp; increase punishments for the fraudsters rather than harden unemployment aid conditions. E. Macron did the latter while decreasing the number of people working on fraud's fighting.

Macron is fighting tax evasion. Why do you think he's created a tax for digital companies and is working on that at an EU level as well? A big theme of his presidency has been getting companies to pay fair taxes, in the appropriate place.

&gt; Most of the French agree on the necessity of investments on countryside towns infrastructures &amp; activities and stop the huge tax cuts offered to the biggest corporations. E. Macron gave billions of euros in tax cut to companies actually firing people and not investing in France meanwhile he lowers once again the resources of local institutions and freeze civil servants wages.

Macron's government announced a huge amount of investment in countryside towns only last year and the bigger provincial cities in France have seen huge investment recently. Tax cuts to companies go back to the first point about needing companies to have money in order to tax them, but even then he's still put a new tax on huge multinationals starting in 2019.

To be honest, your entire post reads like the exact same ""French people don't want him to spend less money, but we also don't want him to make our economy functional, or tax us more"" bullshit. Your policies are just ""He should leave everything as it was before he started"" and he was elected precisely because that situation was shit.

761,"[This](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctpb21/Cpapers/CDP_03_08.pdf) one in particlar was quite interesting, and I had never read it before.

If you take the results: An inflow of immigrants the size of 1% of the UK-born population leads to a 0.6% decline in the wages of the 5% lowest paid workers. So quite a few immigrants (about 5.5m) will cause a very moderate decline in wages for around 5% of the native population. This perfectly falls under the idea of comparative and absolute advantage, so it makes sense.

Still, my point stands. It's not ""normal people bearing the burden instead of the super rich"", it's 5% of the population having a moderate decline in wages so that the entire population can have an increase in productivity and innovation, not to mention the side of immigrants, but I don't think you're interested in that. And that's not to mention the fact that most of these people are gonna be previous immigrants as well, so the point of natives is even weaker.

I gotta be honest, seems like a more than good trade off IMO.

824,"Yes we dislike prescribing antibiotics because of the chance of bacteria becoming resistant to the antibiotics. For those unaware antibiotics follow this principle: the first antibiotic you get target a group of bacteria in a small spectrum. The strongest of that group survives and start multiplying. This happens until the first antibiotic has no effect anymore since the group has become too different for the first antibiotic and places itself outside this spectrum of the first antibiotic. This is resistance for an antibiotic basically. We will have to prescribe in next cases a bigger spectrum antibiotic, after using that a couple of times we will have to prescribe an even bigger spectrum antibiotic until the bacteria place themself out of the biggest spectrum we can treat, meaning we can't treat someome with antibiotics anymore. This is a bit oversimplified, but the basic concept is the same. So if we prescribe antibiotics for every small infection, we will make the chance much bigger for people becoming resistant and following that path I just explained.


Also some antibiotics are expensive and insurances are being twats when you prescribe them. But that's a really small factor in thr choice of antibiotic.","Wat zyde gy tot my, gy kleine duyvelspecht?

We were living in shitty GDR housing in one of those beautiful pre-war two story buildings with just 4 apartments. But if you wanted to take a shit you literally had to leave your apartment, walk half a staircase down and hope that your neighbour doesn't occupy the shitter.   
  
My parents tried to move out after I was born. But back then there was no free apartment market like there is today. You couldn't just open the newspaper and look at adverts for housing. You had to apply for an apartment, and the municipality then decided about your request and assigned you an apartment. Since there was always a shortage of living space, we never got assigned a better apartment during GDR times. We were probably not commie enough. So even though my family (my parents had two children) was eligible for a better apartment, we kept living in that shithole of an apartment. All you could do is write a ""Eingabe"" (petition) to the authorities to complain about lack of living space for your family. But basically half of the GDR had that as their favourite pastime. 

In the last years of GDR the municipality started to build 3 new commie blocks (150 apartments or so, small town hence small commie blocks). The blocks were only finished after the GDR no longer existed. The blocks were owned by the municipality and they prioritised renters who were living in shitty conditions. So my family used the opportunity to move into the ugly and disgusting commie block. And it was basically pure luxury. 


People on reddit love to take the commie block out of context. For most people the move into the commie block was a massive upgrade to their living situation. ",Verfassungspatriot,/r/europe/comments/akl6yi/what_do_you_think_about_this_apartment_building/ef62jlq/,fluchtpunkt,1548677739

856,"*“However, over the last four to five years, the situation has deteriorated considerably when it comes to the survival of the Serbs,” he said. “People sell their property every day and entire families leave. Injustice and division are killing these people.”*

I couldn't agree more with Mr Petrovic. Serbs in Kosovo other than working their lands and farms are not allowed to work anywhere else by Belgrade. This is a fact. Serbs in Kosovo aren't allowed to be hospitalized in Prizren, Gjilan nor in Prishtina, but in Nis, because there can be consequences by the people of Vucic in terrain. Vucic's people have planted bombs in backyards of people here just because they work in Kosovo Institutions, for god's sake.

&gt; THIS is reason Serbia dont allow Kosovo independence... Kosovars just ruin Serbs life by starving them and treat them like 3rd class people,killing Serb politicians,and offering bribes to others so they have to follow their rules,and then lie to usa and eu that they are victims.... so EZ when allowed by west...

Yes, for sure, Albanians and the West want to eradicate all the Serbs. There's a great conspiracy going on...

Here's an investigation made by BIRN (The most objective and respectful media in the Balkans) about killing and intimidation of Serbs in Kosovo. Before putting your tinfoil hat on and creating conspiracy theories read a little.

943,"OK, this is the (relevant part of the) WTO in a nutshell:

Each WTO member can control imports with tariffs. But each member agreed to a maximum tariff per product in WTO negotiations. These are agreed at entry to the WTO and recorded in the so-called schedule. Each member can raise tariffs only to the maximum agreed in the schedule.

For example when Russia entered the WTO, it needed to bind itself to raise a maximum of 10% duties on rice imports, 12% for vodka, 21% for watermelons, etc. (these are arbitrary numbers). Only once all other members where satisfied with Russia‘s schedule, it was allowed to join. After it joined, it can negotiate, e.g. it asks the EU to reduce its tariffs on vodka and offers to reduce Russia‘s tariffs on cars. This is how the WTO basically works.

The UK is still bound by the EU schedule but that changes on the day it leaves. Brexit means it needs to set its own now. For example, it might want to set a 20% tariff on lamb meat to better protect its farmers. But New Zealand, a main exporter of lamb meat to the UK, does not like that. NZ wants ideally a tariff binding of 0%. And so the negotiations start. Russia might want the UK to have no vodka tariff. And so on. And a number of countries basically raised their objection to the UK‘s planned schedule, because it is much easier to pressure the small UK than the large EU. The EU is not objecting the UK, btw.

Only once the schedule is agreed by all WTO members can the UK trade on WTO terms. Russia did need over a decade to negotiate. Brexiters said it will be super easy. It isn’t.

1113,"Venezuelan oil production is dropping and the countries wanting it are becoming fewer every day.  China is switching from Venezuelan to Canadian oil.  The problem with their oil is that it is a heavy (API less than 20°), sour(&gt;.5% sulfur) oil. 

Heavy Merey has an API gravity of 15° and contains 2.7 wt % sulfur, and Leona has an API gravity of 24° and a sulfur content of 1.5 wt %.

One of the uses is bunker fuel which will change next year.

By January 2020, when the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) new bunker fuel requirements take effect, sweet light crude should pull substantially away from heavier grades, regardless how the OPEC deal works out. The IMO suggests that from 2020 onward, bunker fuel should contain max. 0.5 percent Sulphur (compared to the max. 3.5 percent specification currently in vigor), which would adversely affect fuel oil demand and high fuel-oil yielding grades. Since vacuum residue accounts for more than third of the Mexican Maya or Venezuelan Merey yields, we should see a further widening of differentials. 

Companies want the best bang for their buck and Venezuelan oil is no longer producing for them.  If Venezuela gives any more discounts than they will be losing money.  There are to many options out there to go with them.  Once the US and Canada get their pipeline completed this will end any dependence for foreign oil.  Russia and Saudi will be looking for new customers and this will leave Venezuela out in the cold.",USA,/r/europe/comments/akak8p/eu_nations_give_venezuelas_maduro_eightday/ef5mlc8/,busbythomas,1548656350

""After a three-and-a-half-hour meeting Wednesday, Trump promised Juncker he would ""hold off on further tariffs"" on Europe. In exchange, Juncker assured the U.S. president that Europe would import more American soybeans and facilitate imports of liquefied natural gas.

The EU's livestock sector relies heavily on imports to feed farm animals, and indeed the Continent's companies have ramped up purchases of U.S. soybeans.
But that's not because of anything EU officials have done. It's a result of the trade war Trump started with China.

Simply put, the EU offered what it was already going to do. And in exchange, the U.S. agreed not to do what it hasn't done yet.""

Pretty much this, and this feeling of isolation from the continent is an integral part of British culture.

Yeah we were shelled by the Germans in WW1, but the trenches were in Flanders. Sure, the Luftwaffe bombed our cities in WW2 but the main fighting was still across the Channel. 

As a nation we are built off repelling invasions (Battle of Britain, Napoleonic threat, Spanish Armada etc). We aren't used to being occupied, we didn't live under Fascism or Communism. The last successful ""invasion"" of our islands was by William of Orange in 1688, and we bloody invited him over.

Rightfully or wrongfully, conflict on Europe is seen as a ""continental problem"". One which Britain always gets dragged into, in order to rebalance the status quo. Most of our history has been spent keeping a cautious eye on Europe incase trouble brews, but mostly looking globally to our colonies and the lucrative trade it brought us. 

There lies the difference. We're fine with the economic cooperation, but for us, that's just it, we want trade, there's no underlying factor.

1212,"\&gt; How does that make the Soviets equally bad as the Nazis 

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't, and I didn't claim it.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; It wasn't an alliance by any means

&amp;#x200B;

Alliance is only empty word. Poland was allied with England, but who was of greater help - England for Poland, or USSR for Germany? Actions matter, not words or ""scraps of paper"". Germany had non agression pact with Poland an well guess what.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; massive rearmament only started 

&amp;#x200B;

Massive rearnament was possible only thanks to prior cooperation. Cefalopodul mentioned tanks, but actually airforce was far more important relativly to mentioned cooperation. Without Russians, Germans would start without any trained pilots, or any technology to conscruct modern planes. It wasn't just a matter of ""they just would take few more years to arm themselves"" - equipment would become quickly obsolete, German economy couldn't sustain it, and time wouldn't stop for German neighbours.

&amp;#x200B;

Funny, how when each time comes discussion about eastern front, there is army of people to claim how USSR was able to survive only thanks to lend lease, when it contributed to 0% in '41, the year Russians halted German invasion, and ony 2% of USSR production in '42 (it increased in later years). But when it comes to USSR helping with technology, training, and resources in interwar period, it somehow doesn't even matter, despite being  enormously more important in tipping the balance.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Yes because collaborating with a democratic state is the same as collaborating with the Nazis. 

&amp;#x200B;

But how does it matter? Democratic state secrectly bulding army with goal to destroy Poland is somehow moraly right to Nazis doing the same?

But then the serial kidnapper barges back in and stabs the serial killer to death with the help of the cops (rest of the Allies).

1377,"And Poland seized Zaolzie from the Czechs when Hitler was dismembering Czechoslovakia. Czechs were Soviet allies btw, so USSR did not take kindly to that. Also Poland signed a non-aggression Pact with the Nazis in 1934. What USSR did as far as dismembering Poland and signing a pact with the Nazis was an exact mirror of what Poland did. Poland also fought USSR in the 1920s, a war that USSR did not start, but rather clashes of Polish and Ukrainian nationalists did. And don't even get me started on what Poland did in the Baltics. Poland fought Lithuania and also sought to carve off some pieces from them, so much for the supposed brotherhood of the Rzeczpospolita of the past. Poland was not some innocent nation brutally raped by big bad Russia. It was a player in a game and it lost. If it won, then Russia would lose, read about Prometheanism. You either kill or be killed, both USSR and Poland had ambitions that did not allow either to tolerate the existence of the other.

If you're gonna use whataboutism, at least hear out the other side's whatabouts.

I am only sorry for Katyn, that was really bad, massacres of surrendered people are always bad. However, I cannot even feel that bad for the Soviet puppet state in Poland though, because #1: if not for Soviet troops Poland literally wouldn't exist, as in, Nazis were already progressing quite well in their genocide of all of Poland (Jew and Gentile), which was to become directly administered German land settled by Germans.  #2: USSR made Germany give up lands that Poland has not owned in centuries, which are also coincidentally the richest parts of modern day Poland. Again, if not for USSR, Poland would be in a pretty sorry state today. I don't think Poles are crying about those lost territories that are now Belorussia. It's a shithole fucking swampland anyway.

Polish role in the Holocaust

Auschwitz

""Auschwitz first transport: ""The transport departed from the southern Polish city of Tarnów, and consisted of 728 Poles and 20 Polish Jews. ' Until mid‑1942 Poles were the most numerous ethnic group in the camp.' (...) Among the first prisoners, who were brought to the camp, there were soldiers participating in the September Campaign, members of underground resistance organisations, secondary school students and higher education students. All were sent to Auschwitz by the German Sicherheitspolizei Security Police. (...) Numbers were tattooed on the prisoners' arms in the order of their arrival at Auschwitz. These inmates were assigned the numbers 31 through 758.

1636,"Ok so this is where figures get misleading.

6% of business trade into is a relatively small figure but then most business are small, it's like the Pareto principle where a handful of large businesses make up the revenue of most small ones. People are more reliant on bigger businesses as consumers on a day to day basis. The figure also implies exports, imports are more where our dependencies lie (and where we have a trade deficit)

The second flaw is that he's using EU trade as a percentage of GDP. Bear in mind GDP calculation includes public spending which isn't ""trade"" in its purest sense, and that public spending is roughly 40 percent of GDP, so already a large chunk is non addressable.

Then you end up ignoring impacts on individual areas - for example 30% of our food consumed is from the EU, 20% of our fuel, and medicine where over 40% is imported and you start to see where the dependencies lie.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/ak76tq/the_domino_defect/ef4dt5x/,lukekarts,1548619863

And how come that didn't have any effects for the first 20 or so years? If the allies forced that view onto Germany, wouldn't they have accepted Oder-Neisse a lot earlier?

1680,"**Trump blackmails allies at 5G with troop withdrawal**

**The Trump government is making every political effort to prevent Huawei from supplying technology for 5G networks worldwide. In Poland they even play poker with a military base. But governments are beginning to question US interests.**

The Trump government is using every means at its disposal to put pressure on its allies to prevent cooperation with Huawei on 5G. The New York Times reports this, citing government officials. Poland is under pressure from the United States that future deployments of US troops - including the prospect of a permanent base called ""Fort Trump"" - may depend on the Polish decision.

The New York Times' talks with active and former US government officials, intelligence officials and telecommunications executives revealed that the US wants to ban Huawei because of its technological backwardness. According to the New York Times, the White House has been working for months on a decree that is expected in the coming weeks to effectively discourage companies from using Chinese equipment in critical telecommunications networks. This goes far beyond the existing regulations, which only prohibit this in government networks.

Ren Zhengfei, founder of Huawei, has denied that his company is spying for China. *""I continue to love my country. I support the Communist Party of China. But I will never do anything to harm another nation,""* he said earlier this month.

**US Telcos wanted to access Huaweis source code**

According to the New York Times, espionage between China and the USA is not a one-way street either: Already in 2010, during Operation Shotgiant, the NSA invaded the Huawei headquarters, as Edward Snowden had revealed. His documents show that the NSA wanted to prove that Huawei was undercover controlled by the Chinese army. According to former officials, evidence of this was never found. The Snowden documents, however, also show that NSA had another goal: to better understand Huawei's technology and to look for possible back doors to use itself for espionage against other nations. So the US is trying to do exactly what Huawei is accused of, the New York Times reports.

Around 2013, US mobile operators AT&amp;T and Verizon argued that it would make sense to have Huawei set up a test field in the United States because the source code for its network software would have to be disclosed. Huawei's offerings would also lower the price of building the networks, they argued. But the NSA did not allow this.

Trump's course and lack of hard evidence against Huawei, however, had led some countries to question whether the US campaign was really about national security or a competitive advantage for the US. Last year, Huawei generated $100 billion in revenue, twice as much as Cisco and significantly more than IBM.

1714,"&gt; Your first paragraph is wrong, from what I understood, 50% of the subsidies went in the network adaptation. You cannot say ""subsidies were for old technologies, new ones don't need it"", as subsidies in the network are for both new and old renewables.

That's not true. The network costs, for network maintenance, improvement and adaptation, corresponds to [7,27 eurocents per kWh](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/default/files/styles/lightbox_image/public/images/factsheet/composition-average-german-power-price-households-2017-and-2018.png?itok=IsiQF_aF) in Germany, about 25% of the entire electricity bill. Those same network costs correspond to 5,79 eurocents per kWh ( see: https://www.tdworld.com/overhead-transmission/france-will-increase-grid-fees-fund-energy-transition and https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Electricity_price_statistics ), or around 33% of the electricity bill in France. So network costs in Germany are just 25% bigger than in France, while the grid is more stable and presumably more dense in Germany. In the grand scheme of things, those 1,5 eurocents that Germans pay more than the French for their network is insignificant, it's around 5% of the price of electricity. The renewable surcharge, which doesn't exist in France, is the real difference.

&gt; About the second link : CO2 sources (gas, coal, lignite) went from around 360TWh in the 90' to 312TWh in 2018 (-15% in 30 years) ! That's a failure.

That's still better than what [France did since 1990](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Electricity_production_by_sources_in_France.png), where carbon sources practically stayed at the same level for that entire period. You had a golden opportunity provided by the nuclear buildout in the 80' to replace all carbon sources and you didn't even do it.

&gt; I'm sorry but again, if you look only ""energy industries"", you have an average of 380MtCO2eq in the 90'. Taking 1990 as a reference year is not honest as it was exceptionnaly high. So between the 90' and today, you have lower CO2 emissions by less than 20%. That's coherent with the -15% of CO2 sources above.

Taking 1990 as the reference year is the right thing to do because that's the reference year used for the Kyoto protocol and for the EU emissions targets. But anyway, the electricity sector in Germany is keeping up with its sectoral targets. It's not as simple as 15% less carbon sources, then 15% less emissions. Because if for example that -15% comes from the reduction of gas, it will have a certain effect, and if it's from the reduction of coal, it will have a completely different effect.

&gt; Again, that's a bit more complex.

Not really that much more complex. The difference in grid fees between France and Germany is 1,5 eurocents, or around 5% of the electricity bill in Germany, and that's not even adjusted for purchasing power or for the quality and extension of the grid itself. That's a difference that's mostly irrelevant. It's the renewables surcharge that represents the real difference.

&gt; But now, we have built an EPR at Taishan in China, and the know-how is getting back.

That won't happen in Western countries. The nuclear industry is a total disaster in the US, what's happening in the UK is a joke, France and Finland can't even build one new plant, Germany, Switzerland and others have no intention of building any new plants...there's no future for new nuclear in the West.

&gt; You know, I have changed my mind and I now accept than renewable migh be cheaper than nuclear, although it's not as simple as the last buying price. But you seem obstinated witht the fact that Germany did well investing so much in renewable to replace mostly nuclear. Is it that hard to admit that Germany would have really lowered CO2 emission if it invested in renewable AND nuclear to replace coal ?

That's not a matter of opinion, the real numbers of the last nuclear power plants built in Europe and the prices in auctions are very clear. Unsubsidized offshore wind is here to stay, at prices ranging from 50€/MWh to 70€/MWh, onshore wind is the cheapest form of electricity generation in Europe bar none (prices from as low as 25€/MWh to 60€/MWh), solar too is extremely cheap (30-60€/MWh). And for all three technologies prices are still falling. There's no competition.

There'd be no point to invest in new nuclear too, when you can buy more renewables with the same amount of money. Germany's sole problem is that it shouldn't have decided to close its remaining nuclear reactors so early, it should have simply left them on till they reached their design lifetime (just like Switzerland is doing), or it should have increased the auctioned renewable capacity when they decided to close their remaining nuclear plants. That would have caused a bigger fall in CO2 emissions. But to say that CO2 emissions haven't fallen in Germany, or that they replaced nuclear with coal, that's simply wrong.

First there were allegations as detailed here

- [Russian bid to Influence UK](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/10/russian-influence-brexit-vote-detailed-us-senate-report)

- Then came the disclosure - notably that Nigel Farange and Arron Banks weren't just championing Brexit , [they were receiving funds from Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/16/arron-banks-nigel-farage-leave-brexit-russia-connection)

- [Mr. Banks found himself under some rather pressing scrutiny](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44428115) - which he breezily dismissed as ""boozy chats"" the same time he may have retained counsel around said ""boozy chats"".

- [Further investigations](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/national-crime-agency-examines-russian-link-to-arron-banks-962cct78b) - found that what do you know, the primary financier behind Brexit was balls deep into some shady Russian shit. 

Social media being the weaponized platform of choice, even Theresa May has had to answer questions around how thoroughly compromised [Facebook supplied data had become.](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42719027).

But the funny stuff comes when you listen to MI-6 former leadership state clearly that [Brexit constitutes a threat to the national security of the UK](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-brexit-deal-mi6-national-security-eu-richard-dearlove-a8721471.html)

The [wikipedia entry details additional evidence of such](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_Brexit_referendum) 

- And of course there is the congressional testimony of [Christopher Wylie](https://www.c-span.org/video/?445621-1/cambridge-analytica-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-testifies-data-privacy) on his personal experience working with Russians to impact both Brexit and US elections during 2016 while functioning as a DBA/analyst for Cambridge Analytica, which we [all remember as a festive front for Russian influence](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2018/10/03/458841/origins-russias-broad-political-assault-united-states/)

1940,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainiai_massacre

&gt;The Rainiai massacre (Lithuanian: Rainių žudynės) was the mass murder of between 70 and 80 Lithuanian political prisoners by the NKVD, with help from the Red Army, in a forest near Telšiai, Lithuania, during the night of June 24–25, 1941. It was one of many similar massacres carried out by Soviet forces in Lithuania, and other parts of the USSR, during June 1941. Several thousand people were killed in these massacres.


&gt;A decision had been made to carry out the massacre after the June Revolt had taken place, during which the Lithuanian Activist Front had deposed the Soviet government in Lithuania, and Nazi Germany had invaded the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities were unable to evacuate the inmates (political prisoners) of the Telšiai prison, but they did not want to abandon them, as the inmates would then have been freed by the local population or by the Germans. Therefore, a punishment squad of the Red Army led by Dontsov was called in to ""liquidate"" them.


&gt;Most of the prisoners were put into trucks during the night of June 24 and taken to the Rainiai forest where they were tortured and killed. Many of the victims were so mutilated that only twenty-seven bodies could be identified after they were exhumed, only three days later.


&gt;According to the coroner's examination after the exhumation, both the report and the testimonies of witnesses, concurred that the Soviets cut off tongues, ears, genitals, scalps, put genitals into mouths, picked out eyes, pulled off fingernails, made belts of victims' skins to tie their hands, burned them with torches and acid, crushed bones and skulls, all done while the prisoners were still alive. The organizers of the massacre included Pyotr Raslan, Boris Mironov, Nachman Dushanski, political leader of 8th border army Mikhail Kompanyanec, NKVD Kretinga county deputy director Yermolayev, NKVD lieutenant Zhdanov and others.


&gt;Most of those who were killed in the Rainiai massacre had been arrested for political reasons from the time when Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940. Some of them, like Vladas Petronaitis, were arrested for their roles in the independence struggle or their societal roles in independent Lithuania (""intellectuals"", politicians, lawyers, policemen and public servants). Some had been arrested as ""enemies of the revolution"" for their business interests, land ownership or savings, as Soviet propaganda taught that businessmen and landlords were thieves and oppressors. Other people were arrested for possession of non-communist literature (such as books which supported the idea of independent Lithuania or were written by authors considered to be in the wrong by the Soviets), owning a Lithuanian flag, not giving their crops to the Soviet authorities, and similar ""crimes"". Others had been arrested without any evidence, because their friends had been arrested or because someone had ""denounced"" them. This group included mainly younger people, such as students from the Telšiai Crafts School (aged 18 – 19), and young people from the villages around Telšiai. Many were arrested for having been members of certain parties and organizations such as Boy Scouts.[3]",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/ak9nsp/today_74_years_ago_on_27_january_2019_the_soviet/ef3l8lm/,Sigakoer,1548598302

Oh sure I don’t deny there were political prisoners.

But unlike the Nazi camps where those people were killed, many political prisoners sent to the gulag got released.

I’m not sure about this one... which ethnicity did they cleanse?

According to the Court, this principle is inherent to the specific nature of the European Community. At the time of the first judgment of this established case law (Costa/ENEL,15 July 1964, Case 6/641) there was no mention of primacy in the treaty. It is still the case today.

Crash hard for a couple months and you'll come back on your knee, begging for any sort of deal, probably re-applying pronto or cancel the whole thing if in transition. In the end, the UK will be weaker than it ever been which is a good thing for the EU as a whole, as your country was either stalling it or trying to sabotaging for the last 40 years.

And the funny thing about that irish issue is that it is now the only reason why the UK would crash without a deal... and the harder the UK crash after a no-deal, the tougher the hit on the british and NI economy, the most likely NI ends up having a referundum for Unification.

2003,"Well them maybe you should have searched for a bit more than an hour. The renewables energy surcharge applied to retail electricity prices in Germany was needed years ago, when renewables were extremely expensive. At that point in time Germany and Denmark took the slack of the rest of the world, they subsidised renewables massively, to lower their prices. The renewables surcharge they are still paying today is for those old installations. It’s thanks to German and Danish subsidies that renewables fell to prices comparable to fossil fuels, making them accessible to the rest of the world. But that’s not the case anymore. Germany transitioned from a feed-in tariff system to an auction system for all new installations. The feed-in system is still obviously there for the old generating capacity, but not for the new one. The auction system lowered prices much further, to the level spoken in those articles, which by the way were not all from “pro-renewable sources” (which wouldn’t be a problem anyway since they are just reporting on the information provided by the auctioning body). 

As for those supposed experts, I’m not sure what they smoked, but maybe they should really look at the emissions of [Germany](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/default/files/styles/gallery_image/public/uba_germanghgemissions1990_2017_clew.png?itok=T7nO2KD0). That’s a 28% fall since 1990. Also, it’s simply not true that [coal usage didn’t fall](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/default/files/styles/gallery_image/public/fig2_gross_power_production_in_germany_1990_2018.png?itok=WBExe4DO). On the contrary, every single type of electricity generation apart from renewables and gas fell massively. Hard coal, brown coal, nuclear, oil, they all fell.

Germans are paying a much higher price, but as I already explained it’s not for the new renewables, it’s for the old ones, for the generating capacity that was installed when renewables were extremely expensive.

Germany would have reduced emissions waay less if it had invested in nuclear instead of renewables, simply because nuclear is much, much more expensive than renewables and there’s no price reductions for nuclear, in fact its becoming more and more expensive instead of cheaper. You also chose to completely disregard the fact that not a single nuclear plant in Western Europe was built on time and on budget in the last what? 20 years or more? Not even in massive nuclear user France. Flamanville is like what? Years behind schedule and more than 3 times (more than 200%) overbudget? By the time it’ll be completed in 2020 (hopefully) it’ll be 13 years since construction started. New nuclear can’t even make a difference for climate change now, since even by starting to build new reactors right now with such a long construction time it’ll be 2030 at the soonest before they’re completed, and by that time emissions *have to* already be 45-50% lower in Europe if we intend to have any chance of preventing the worst of climate change. 

Also Lazard is in no way a pro-renewables source, and the prices indicated there confirm what I’m saying (and those prices for nuclear don’t even include the overbudget prices).",Italy,/r/europe/comments/ajz50r/germany_to_stop_using_coal_by_end_of_2038/ef3dedv/,Etain05,1548590775

Maybe you should read the very article that OP linked.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Leningrad#Finnish_participation

&gt; By August 1941, the Finns advanced to within 20 km of the northern suburbs of Leningrad at the 1939 Finnish-Soviet border, threatening the city from the north; they were also advancing through East Karelia, east of Lake Ladoga, and threatening the city from the east. The Finnish forces crossed the pre-Winter War border on the Karelian Isthmus by eliminating Soviet salients at Beloostrov and Kirjasalo, thus straightening the frontline so that it ran along the old border near the shores of Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga, and those positions closest to Leningrad still lying on the pre-Winter War border.

The closest positions to Leningrad were *at the old Finnish border.*

&gt; For the next three years, the Finns did little to contribute to the battle for Leningrad, maintaining their lines.[40] Their headquarters rejected German pleas for aerial attacks against Leningrad[41] and did not advance farther south from the Svir River in occupied East Karelia (160 kilometres northeast of Leningrad), which they had reached on 7 September. In the southeast, the Germans captured Tikhvin on 8 November, but failed to complete their encirclement of Leningrad by advancing further north to join with the Finns at the Svir River. On 9 December, a counter-attack of the Volkhov Front forced the Wehrmacht to retreat from their Tikhvin positions in the River Volkhov line.[2][4]

The German encirclement of Leningrad failed because Finland refused to take orders from the Germans and therefore refused in taking part in the siege.

&gt; On 6 September 1941, Germany's Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl visited Helsinki. His main goal was to persuade Mannerheim to continue the offensive. In 1941, President Ryti declared to the Finnish Parliament that the aim of the war was to restore the territories lost during the Winter War and gain more territories in the east to create a ""Greater Finland"".[42][43][44] After the war, Ryti stated: ""On August 24, 1941 I visited the headquarters of Marshal Mannerheim. The Germans aimed us at crossing the old border and continuing the offensive to Leningrad. I said that the capture of Leningrad was not our goal and that we should not take part in it. Mannerheim and Minister of Defense Walden agreed with me and refused the offers of the Germans. The result was a paradoxical situation: the Germans could not approach Leningrad from the north..."" There was little or no systematic shelling or bombing from the Finnish positions.[19] 

""But the precense of Finnish troops on Finnish territory was a threat to Leningrad!"" Apparently not according to the Leningrad commander General M. Popov:

&gt; The proximity of the Finnish border – 33–35 km (21–22 mi) from downtown Leningrad – and the threat of a Finnish attack complicated the defence of the city. At one point, the defending Front Commander, Popov, could not release reserves opposing the Finnish forces to be deployed against the Wehrmacht because they were needed to bolster the 23rd Army's defences on the Karelian Isthmus.[46] Mannerheim terminated the offensive on 31 August 1941, when the army had reached the 1939 border. Popov felt relieved, and redeployed two divisions to the German sector on 5 September.[47]

*However*, Finnish command wasn't completely spotless, as a sea-born German detachment was allowed to cut off Ladoga:

&gt; Subsequently, the Finnish forces reduced the salients of Beloostrov and Kirjasalo,[48] which had threatened their positions at the sea coast and south of the River Vuoksi.[48] Lieutenant General Paavo Talvela and Colonel Järvinen, the commander of the Finnish Coastal Brigade responsible for Ladoga, proposed to the German headquarters the blocking of Soviet convoys on Lake Ladoga. The German command formed the 'international' naval detachment (which also included the Italian XII Squadriglia MAS) under Finnish command and the Einsatzstab Fähre Ost under German command. These naval units operated against the supply route in the summer and autumn of 1942, the only period the units were able to operate as freezing waters then forced the lightly equipped units to be moved away, and changes in front lines made it impractical to reestablish these units later in the war.[19][31][49][50]",Finland,/r/europe/comments/akagg2/on_this_day_75_years_ago_the_siege_of_leningrad/ef3dn92/,Arschfauster,1548591087

2069," Germany was equally victims of the War. That's the case of every War. German were so most brutal side especially against Russian. Committed brutal attricocities and it's a shame we don't learn much about them in school at we focus a lot more on the Holocaust. The mass starvation of Soviet-Soldiers and the Siege of Leningrad were mentioned only briefly in my history lessons.
What the problem I have is the faction that says all were evil and every dead German is a reason to celebrate.

German were persecuted and killed. NSDAP won with a plurality not a majority. It's consent between Scientist that there was a majority support for the Dictatorship but not since when and not how much of majority.

The other thing is Wehrmacht is a conscription army that was located all over Europe. In France it was hard to commit a War crime. In the Soviet-Union it was very common.

I think with small reconciliation gift from Germany is good way to remember us that we brought a lot destruction.

But starting a baseless clean Wehrmacht discussion here is strange. 

An  easy explanation:
NSDAP very bad
SS and SA very bad
Wehrmacht as institution bad since Spanish Civil War.
Wehrmacht Soldier case to case as it's the thing you could landed involuntary or could be against Nazi.
Doesn't mean involuntary or resistance didn't commit war crimes, or volunteers did. As said case to case.

As said let's build on the spirit of reconciliation like the money Germany and stuff the Deutsche Kriegsgräber Fürsorge does and other organizations. 


But probably now I'm also clean Wehrmacht, because I didn't say all Germans are evil and should be killed.

* Moral philosopher [Etienne Vermeersch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etienne_Vermeersch), often seen as Flanders' most influential intellectual, has passed away at 84. In his young years Vermeersch was a jesuit, but he fell from his faith in his 20s and became an outspoken atheist and sceptic. He became a professor in philosophy at the [Ghent University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghent_University) (where he served as vice-rector for a while). He's mostly known as a public opinion maker who helped pave the way for the legalisation of abortion and euthanasia in Belgium. Other topics he was involved in were religion, climate, population growth and migration. He was often praised for his very rational way of thinking and his strong arguments, even by those who disagreed with him. Vermeersch opted for euthanasia and was cremated in private circle. According to his last words he died thanks to his own lifework, but he didn't want to make a statement by it, other people have to decide for themselves.
* The weekly climate protests keep growing, this thursday 35,000 people turned up in Brussels. The growth is mostly to thank to university students joining the protest, now that their exams have finished.

Yes, many geopolitical decisions are based on interests, but it is foolish to think that everything is dictated by realpolitik and machievellian dictators. Many more factors are important, among those democracy. Why are almost all the non democratic nations allied? Why are almost all the democratic nations allied? Often it is not interest, as it used to be in the interest of Germany and France to fight eachother. 

The US got into the middle east during the cold war, trying to win the battle of influence with the Soviet Union, many seemed to have forgotten that they did the exact same thing. And yes, that included flipping dictators to democracy because often the democratic states were pro capitalism, and yes that also included bringing down democratically elected socialists in for example Chile. I dont condone those actions, but in the light of the coldwar (during which many predicted that USSR economy would outgrow the US) the US felt like it had to be done. 

So yes, its often interest. But only the naive cynic amateur thinks its 100% interest and nothing else.

Höcke is just the best and most obvious example that the AfD is an extremist party and not just your average anti-immigration party. 

Nothing that the Greens are doing is even remotely as extremist as anything that the AfD or even Die Linke is doing and it's quite ridiculous that you drag the Greens and the AfD into the same old ""but the others are bad too"" argument.

&gt;When the commercial internet was born in the 1990s, governments made many allowances for young companies navigating this new space. They were given carve-outs and exemptions, either explicitly or implicitly, from laws and regulations that older legacy businesses faced in areas ranging from tax, to liability for user misconduct on their sites, to copyright infringement.   
&gt;  
&gt;Silicon Valley companies — now the largest, richest corporate entities in the world — have thrown millions of dollars and all their lobbying muscle at protecting these carve-outs, which amount in effect to billions of dollars in subsidies.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Silicon Valley has been able to convince many consumers that their interests and those of the platform tech companies are the same. But the era of the Teflon tech group is ending. As the economy shifts from one driven by tangible assets to one driven by intangibles such as intellectual property and data, there is strong reason to think that the platform companies that have ringfenced these assets enjoy unfair regulatory advantages. Their efforts to protect outdated exceptions look increasingly like rent-seeking.  
&gt;  
&gt;The rules of the digital economy need rewriting to reflect the shifts of the past 20 years. There may be room for improvement in the EU’s proposals. But at a time when an increasing portion of global wealth resides in content, data and intellectual property, the biggest companies should respect that IP and pay a fair price for it.

Özdemir -&gt; Habeck was not a move to the centre.

They had between 6 and 10 % in elections for the last 20 years now with one huge surge in polls after Fukushima.

It's largely because the SPD is collapsing, Greens have been in the centre in 2005 already but back then the SPD had 30+ %. Apart from that Habeck is actually relatively left-wing, especially compared to Özdemir. It's not because of the goddamn centrism but because he is actually tapping into what German politicians have feared for the past 20 years, a vision for the future.

The report is about 2016/2017. Since I can't be arsed to compare to earlier years, I'll just compare those two years.

If you understand German you can look around in the data yourself: 

https://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/DE/Publikationen/Migrationsberichte/migrationsbericht-2016-2017.html?nn=1362958

&gt; I am guessing Germans are down but European Union stayed the same with MENA and other asians up.

23.6% (19.258 million) of the people living in Germany have a migrant background (2016: 22.6% (18.443 million), 2015: 21.2%). 

- 14.4% of the people with migrant background are of Turkish background (2016: 15.1%)
- 10.9% Poland (2016: 10.1%)
- 7.2% Russia (6.6%)
- 6.4% Kazakhstan (5.2%)

Oooookay not sure where god comes from of all things, you're taking my metaphor a bit too on the nose there it seems. And yes, the EU has not been around forever, neither has a peace in Europe that lasted this long, if we're going to start on history.

You speak as though we don't have access to the formula and the majority of relevant variables. There are certainly unknowns and the future can change drastically, but the course given what we know now spells absolute disaster, hoping the situation changes out of sheer wishful thinking, just because it *could* is complete lunacy.

My issue with Brexit is not so much the general idea of leaving (which is dumb as hell regardless, but not impossible to pull off) but the fact that they're leaving with no prep and in less than 1/10th of the time they'd actually need to pull this off.

Instead we are all actually run by 27 political divas trying to get re-elected, so all our responses are done by commitee. Now, I am not anti-democracy, but you can't run an entire continent by commitee, democratic or not. There has to be someone to blame or praise at the end of the day, but national governments like their closed door horse-trading too much.

Now as for a sensible military procedure. For defensive issues, the answer is clear since we can use the swiss model: The moment military aggression is encountered a Mashall of the Army is appointed at takes command, under review of the Council. There's a lot we can learn from the Swiss there.

As for offensive issues, I do believe that whatever happens member states should have a right to have a national force and they alone can initiate an aggressive response. If some sort of convention is eventually negotiated for some role of the EU Parliament and the Council to initiate a united aggressive action, I think that's better left to future generations as they adapt to the problems at hand.

That leads to discrimination. And discrimination has to be censored. Free speach ends where it hurts another beeings basic rights.

2759,"&gt; and increase the number of troops to protect enclaves from imminent massacres.

This is such a naive thing to write. But it's not your fault, you lack basic understanding of what is an ethnic war.

In ethnic war every conquest is a war crime. In ethnic war you don't conquer population, you evict them, otherwise you have enemies on your territory because all people of the other ethnicity are enemies and you can't trust them and the whole point of war is to expand your ethnic territory (where your group lives). 

And to make them leave you have to make them fear you. Rape, murder, looting... We didn't invent this, that is how wars are fought at this very moment in the worlds and how they were always fought. After WW2 Europeans and Americans may have forgotten this though ""we've grown better than this"" ideology, but they really haven't and one day they'll prove it again.

So how do you protect the civilians from that? Only one way, you have to defend them, you have to put troops on the ground and protect every besieged city. But if you protect one, the army will go for the other (while the defending army will use this one as a shield). So you basically have to take over entire disputed territory, you have to disarm the armies, you have to end dissent from the locals by placing cooperative locals in power and - you've created a colony. A puppet, if you will. 

I'll not even go into the political nightmare deploying a huge army in such an endevour and suffering many casualties would have in home countries of the intervention force and geopolitical consequences of such an invasion.

Or you pick one side and help them win the war. No, Croatia did not receive such help. We got recognition after we were given three months to see if we'll survive against JNA, and then we were allowed to buy crappy old Soviet weapons and hire American advisors. None of that was for free. Then we were allowed to counterattack. Basically, we were allowed to fight the war and survive and that was all the help we got. 

&gt;  But if it's in your own backyard on 50 years after genocide in Western Europe, you cannot sit by and do nothing.

So it's not actually about protecting civilians, it's about proving to yourself that you've grown and that you can't let Balkanites kill each other in your sphere of influence. Who gave them the illusion they can do whatever they want? Peasants.

&gt; As for you or anyone else getting upset about being treated this way or that way, you can worry about that all you want afterwards, more important to save civilians.

I am not upset about being treated any way, I am a realist. I am cringing on your naive notions of moral high ground. Countries do what is in their interest, geopolitics drives what they do, not morality, except in an extend to how much it affects elections. That is why Tutsis were massacred in front of European and American troops at the same time Srebrenica happened. It wasn't a big news, suffering casualties in some African shithole would affect votes more than saving a million Tutsis. That is how the world works. And everything that happened in former Yugoslavia, when it comes to foreign intervention and politics, was a matter of votes and elections in Europe and US, not a matter of countries being enlightened.

Traditionally people in many African countries don't give a crap about age as a concept. I mean there's vague awareness but specific numbers are like, so what? Big whoop you're 13, what does that even mean to me?

The markers of sexual and marital readiness are *physical* in such cultures and nothing else. Does she have developed breasts, hips? Is she having periods? If so then she's good to go. 10, 12, 15, 17 - if the girl is ready to have a baby she is ready to get one, that is the mentality.

We apply our codified notions of 'age of consent' but these cultures don't give a shit about that. Many older people especially will have no idea what their specific age is. It's a vague concept.

Repress the physical signs of fertility and you buy time to deal with the consequences of that, you suppress their aging.

In a sick sort of way it comes from a twisted sense of love for the child that the parent sees themselves as holding back the brutality and duty of childbearing. They are buying time to get things in order.

One of the pathways they detail is that in which we go over the limit, but because of negative emissions we bring it back down. The result depends on how ""over"" the limit we go.

Also keep in mind, that we currently are in track for 4-5C of warming if we stay on the current track. The report doesn't detail such pathways, but it doesn't mean that we shouldn't consider them.

3108,"Your second link illustrates how complicated is to determine $/kWh of produced energy over lifetime of power plant. Studies differ by huge margins on $/kWh metric. Most studies doesn't take everything into account:

* cost of capital ( inflation related) is major part nuclear power cost, because initial investment is high and operating life of new reactors is 60-100+ years. Studies that use global average cost of capital will give significantly higher total cost $/kWh compared to OECD/US/EU cost of capital. [Lazard report, page 14/15](https://www.lazard.com/media/438038/levelized-cost-of-energy-v100.pdf)

* Capacity factors of renewable resources are wildly different for different countries, like compare windy Denmark with [~31% in 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_Denmark#Capacities_and_production) Denmark vs Czech Republic with [22-23% in 2017](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C4%9Btrn%C3%A1_energie#V%C4%9Btrn%C3%A9_elektr%C3%A1rny_v_%C4%8Cesku).

* Some studies use very conservative lifespans on nuclear power plants instead of 60-100+ years of new plants.

* Some studies don't include transmission and/or back-up power costs incurred due to the use of intermittent power sources such as wind and solar energy

* Some studies don't include health and environment related costs.

Example:

Lazard Report (linked before) have 97-136 MWh for nuclear energy and mean 119$/MWh with 8% cost of debt.

* But only 90$/MWh mean with 5% cost of debt. Current cost of debt for 10 Year US treasury is 3.1%. [2015 OECD](https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/finance-and-investment/oecd-business-and-finance-outlook-2017/cost-of-debt-for-non-financial-state-owned-enterprises-and-other-non-financial-companies_9789264274891-graph44-en#page1) cost of debt for non-financial state-owned enterprises is 3.61% with peak of 4.71% in 2008.

* It doesn't take transmission and/or back-up power costs into consideration, this is important to include for wind and solar

* It's using only 40 years expected lifespan instead of 60-100+ years of new nuclear power plants.

* It's using 38-55% capacity factors for wind. Even 38% is higher then Denmark's average

* Health related costs are not taken into consideration, important for coal

* To be fair it doesn't take nuclear waste disposal and storage related costs into consideration

Nationalism is the political ideology saying that states should be build along the borders of nations (the *nation state*), governed by the nation, and act in its interest. The ""nation"" (which has since become synonymous with the nation *state*) refers to a group of people with a shared national identity.

This is opposed to previous political concepts like absolute monarchy, where political rule was often over territories spanning multiple nations, and derived from God or property rights possessed by a single individual or family.

3151,"&gt;The ""hired goons"" were indeed ultra-nationalists

I said they were used to label the peaceful protesters as ultra-nationalists. Are you saying all these people shown in the video are ultra-nationalists?

&gt;as two of them ""proudly"" posted on facebook (the first example posted a photo of the clash with the riot police claiming that he was the guy depicted and the second posted of a photo of a shield looted from the riot police, having an nationalistic symbol sprayed on it).

They did what the police wanted someone to do so they could start firing chemicals at everyone. If these two, or some more did that for that reason or not, I don't know.

&gt;Giannis Lagos, Golden Dawn (nationalistic party) MP, was also present in the clash.

So what?

&gt;The vast majority of media in Greece are against both Tsipras' government and the agreement itself, and I don't think any Greek person can deny this.

I can and so can many others. If they were really against the government and the agreement, they would actually broadcast the protests instead of showing irrelevant talk shows and reruns of old TV series. One of the largest demonstrations took place in the capital, but the channels didn't bother showing it. Yet when Tsipras speaks at some event, it's shown on every channel.

What makes you think they are against the government and the agreement?

&gt;The ""hired goons hanging out with members of the riot police"" were just policemen in plain clothes, as Olga Gerovasili, minister for citizen protection, said.

First of all, when thousands of innocent citizens are gassed by the police, the minister of citizen protection loses her credibility. In fact, any member of the parliament who voted for this ""deal"" when most citizens were against it loses its credibility, but let's ignore that.

Gerovasili said that these were officers of the ""service of officials of the parliament"" and she was talking about people runing just outside of the parliament's gates. But the ""officials of the parliament"" were not there. Also, they were not wearing ""plain clothes"", they were covering their faces.

Having said that, I agree that a lot of the thugs we see in protests, not just in this one, are actual riot police officers in ""thug"" clothing who act agressive, in order to give their colleagues an excuse to use forse against the peaceful protesters.

In the end, what matters is that a huge peacefull protest was crushed because of a handful of thugs, as it happens in almost all protests in this country (and probably others). And many ""news"" outlets only showed the thugs. And, of course, the deal was passed.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/ajp2l1/greek_lawmakers_pass_prespes_deal_for_north/ef0iz8g/,Olympios-Zeus,1548512100

3179,"&gt; The EU knew it could only keep the UK as a member if it gave us opt-outs from aspects of EU-integration which are deeply unpopular with the British people. They did this so the EU could retain Britain's budget contributions and military and economic power for the EU's own benefit. It was always a transactional arrangement for both sides. The British people would want to leave the moment that they perceived that the disadvantages of EU membership outweighed the advantages.

This is nonsens. The other EU member states gave optouts because they wanted things to be done, not because they feared the UK would leave.

There was never the possibilty on the table that the UK or any of the other members would exit the EU, when they don't get any concessions.

The EU wouldn't function, if blackmailing would work. And this is the big illusion from brexiters about the EU.

Even for the UK government such thing was such an impossibility option, that they thought, they could play silly games about this.

&gt; The majority of British people simply don't feel politically and socially bound to a common Europe like many on the continent do (personally I think that is a big illusion among Europeans). 

Times will show how bound the UK and the British people really are to the EU.

3186,"Finland has a mixed economy system, the sort that many would call ""democratic socialism"". It basically has a capitalistic system working inside a framework of state control that's supposed to ensure that everyone at least survives and power isn't allowed to accumulate excessively. 

In that system, the right-left struggle can be seen as one where the right wants to pull back on the framework of the state, so that corporations and individuals have more freedom from state control, while the left generally wants to increase the reach of the state to limit the power of corporations and individuals so that others can be more free from them.

In capitalism, because the wealthy will work for their own interests, and because they have the means to monopolise power and control politicians and any entities they can buy (such as the press, land, patents, etc), the initial state where everyone gets to compete is quickly lost, as those in power will place obstacles below them so that others can not reach them. 

The left wants to use the state to limit this and open up new paths by which others can enter the market and thrive without being eternally locked to a status below that which the latter generations of the wealthy merely inherited. 

The problem with the left in power, in a system that isn't sufficiently transparent and free, is that when they are in power, they might seek to amass ever more power and connections and refuse to let others compete on an even footing; so corruption sets in and the state will overreach.

So you have the left trying to expand the state, at the risk that they will eventually use the state to control people; and the right trying to expand corporations, at the risk that they will eventually use those corporations to control people. In either case, those at the bottom of the society, be they minorities, the young, the old, the unemployed, or simply the poor, will suffer the most, and end up with the least freedom. 

Where you are born comes to decide whether you are ruled by an oppressive state, or by oppressive corporations. Somewhere, hopefully, there's a balance that allows the strata of society enough continuous flux to facilitate the rise of those at the bottom. That's why it's good to have multiple parties on the left and the right to try to pull, each in their favoured direction, and, hopefully, avoid the generation of political dynasties that are perpetually in control.

I'm personally on the left, as I generally tend to think that the haves have too much, and the have-nots are given too little power. I'm also usually on the side of the underdog in most scenarios, assuming that they have not done anything to hurt others.

Incidentally, the right-left divide I described above is complicated by the introduction of so-called social justice issues, where conservatism tends to mostly align with the right in economic policy, but leans authoritatian on social issues. For instance, when the left wants to stop the state from mandating things like accepted forms of marriage or allowed religious activities, the right usually wants to expand the state on these issues (by banning gay marriage or preserving an official state church, say). 

It's similar with things like abortion, birth control, sex reassignment surgery, etc: the left would prefer that the state provides the services and the people are allowed to use them according to their situation, while the right generally wants the state to mandate that everyone must yield to the majority view. So that's an area where the general views regarding the desired reach of the state get flipped along the right-left axis.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/ajzl8t/i_might_be_exaggerating/ef0jf3b/,bo-tvt,1548512429

&gt;German leadership decided that in 15–20 years the Polish state under German occupation was to be fully cleared of any ethnic Poles and settled by German colonists.[35]:32 A majority of them, now deprived of their leaders and most of their intelligentsia (through mass murder, destruction of culture, the ban on education above the absolutely basic level, and kidnapping of children for Germanization), would have to be deported to regions in the East and scattered over as wide an area of Western Siberia as possible. According to the plan this would result in their assimilation by the local populations, which would cause the Poles to vanish as a nation.[30]

&gt;According to plan, by 1952 only about 3–4 million 'non-Germanized' Poles (all of them peasants) were to be left residing in the former Poland. Those of them who would still not Germanize were to be forbidden to marry, the existing ban on any medical help to Poles in Germany would be extended, and eventually Poles would cease to exist.

&gt; Capitalism is description of economic model that was ALREADY IN PLACE when people started to call it capitalism.

Capitalism is not just an economic system, it is a system of power – a separate power system from the already existing system where kings and emperors rule. A system where not the power of the sword or birthright counts, but where the amount of money one has translates into power.

Capitalism is an invention of the early modern era, when the first powerful merchant cities emerged. Before, the wealthy always were the kings, clergy or noblemen. In Capitalism, this changed, because ""ordinary citizens"" started to amass capital and formed a new social class.

&gt; Capitalism in essence is individuals trading their goods and people buying those goods.

No, that is a market system. A market system is not capitalism. Market systems are an important part of capitalism, but they existed before capitalism existed.

&gt; Socialism is direct opposite of that. State creates goods and then redistributes them amount people.

No, that is what is called ""state planned economy"", a system which can be state capitalistic as well. Socialism would be if the means of production are owned by the workers or people of a country.

Planned economy vs. market economy isn't a question of Capitalism vs Socialism, it is just a question of how you want to structure your economy. The difference between Capitalism and Socialism is that in Socialism, the power of the capital is taken out of the equation.

So? First of all the court isnt the government. And there is no reason to assume the right is a monolitic block. Why should it be?

&gt;  the article mentions nothing that casts this group as far-right.

""The group's denial of established constitutional democratic order is akin to ""sovereign citizen"" or ""rejectionist"" movements such as the ""Citizens of the Reich"" [""Reichsbürger""] in Germany – a cluster of anarchists, racist neo-Nazis and esoteric adherents.""

You dont get much further to the right than a Reichsbürger ... a person who literally claims the German Reich still exists.

3493,"&gt;The early history of capitalism was not of lifting people up from poverty. And farm life was preferable for many.

You mean that much preferable that they THEMSELVES moved from farms to city to work in factories ? I think you don't understand what it means to work on farm at those times. Working 10-12 hours in factory is much easier work than working 12 hours in a field and at the end of the day you earn some money you can spend on life while on farm you barely got anything.

Modern life as we know it started because of those factories.
Kids which is like the sole argument people have before factories were working in fields from as long as they could hold hoes and they worked exactly same like their parents.

The biggest lie of communism is that it managed to convince factories were bad where there is enough example that says they were actually good.

You can see that now in China. Why people who have easy life on traditional rice farms go to cities work in those hell conditions and living in barracks ?

In spite of -22 degree C temperatures, the inspired scene was captured on the morning of January 21 from the mountains near Zermatt, Switzerland. Different exposures record the dim red light reflected by the Moon fully immersed in Earth's shadow. Seen directly above the famous Alpine peak, but about 600 light-years away, are the stars of the Praesepe or Beehive star cluster also known as Messier 44. An added reward to the cold eclipse vigil, a bright and colorful meteor flashed below the temporarily dimmmed Moon, just tracing the Matterhorn's north-eastern climbing route along Hornli ridge.

The Matterhorn (Monte Cervino in Italian) is one of the most famous and deadliest mountains in the world, it is estimated that over 500 alpinists have died on the Matterhorn since the first climb in 1865. In the winter of 1965 Walter Bonatti climbed its North face (Nordwand) solo, a feat rarely repeated since then.

Since we are quoting wikipedia:

&gt;The Macedonians (Greek: Μακεδόνες, Makedónes) were an ancient tribe that lived on the alluvial plain around the rivers Haliacmon and lower Axios in the northeastern part of mainland Greece. Essentially an ancient Greek people,[1] they gradually expanded from their homeland along the Haliacmon valley on the northern edge of the Greek world, absorbing or driving out neighbouring non-Greek tribes, primarily Thracian and Illyrian.[2][3] They spoke Ancient Macedonian, a language closely related to Ancient Greek, perhaps a dialect, although the prestige language of the region was at first Attic and then Koine Greek.[4] Their religious beliefs mirrored those of other Greeks, following the main deities of the Greek pantheon, although the Macedonians continued Archaic burial practices that had ceased in other parts of Greece after the 6th century BC. Aside from the monarchy, the core of Macedonian society was its nobility. Similar to the aristocracy of neighboring Thessaly, their wealth was largely built on herding horses and cattle.

&gt;It is extremely expensive to study in the US, but despite this tertiary education is still more prevalent than in most other places. 

Because places often advertise for a position and demand you have a college degree.  Any degree.  They don't care.  College degrees are necessary for so many things that it's ridiculous, and defeats the point of it.  We might as well ensure that everyone just stays in school between 18-22 while nationalizing the universities in this state.

&gt;So this idea that there is a lack of college graduates in the US because of cost is not true.

Never stated or even implied.  There's a lack of college graduates in certain fields because you're allowed to be the something-millionth person to get another degree in English or Communication instead of nursing.  It's made worse by degrees like nursing taking a lot longer, and therefore more money, to be competitive.

&gt;I'm simply saying that the exorbitant cost of education is *not* the reason why there is a mismatch between college degrees and job requirements. 

Where?  I have to reread that sentence because I can't even connect the two.

C. Israel is on the top 10% of countries when it comes to women’s rights, animal rights, LGBT rights, personal freedoms and education.

3899,"&gt;You can find the ""family reasons"" permits for staying for 12 month or over in that database as well, just as I said.

So exactly what I said then ? They're temporary and last for 12 months tops. (It fits the criteria to display 12 months and over)

&gt;Maybe it's true for Moscow, but in the rest of Russia the average salary is 42 550 rubles a month before 13% personal income tax according to Rosstat, so it's currently $561 a month after the tax, or $6732 a year. Even worse, the median salary (i.e. the salary earned by 50% of the workers) is actually about 26 900 rubles a month, so the median yearly salary is $4920.

Not connected to anything

&gt;I wonder why some people think that Russia is any better than an average third-world country. Is it just because it has nukes? Look at the data: the total health care spending in Russia in 2017 was 3 035.4 billion rubles which is $323 a year per capita. It's lower than the health care spending per capita in 2015 in countries like Botswana or Namibia, for example.

it has nothing to do with nukes just the level of technology and education. Namibia and Botswana can spend all the money per capita they want, they don't have trained doctors, they don't have trained nurses, their education is crap, their access to technology is shit. 

There's a reason why Russia is among the small number of nations that makes advancements in medicine, and namibia and botswana don't.  They just use what others give them and pay more for it.

&gt;The overall impressions of Russia outside of Moscow and St. Petersburg are basically like in this video about Murmansk. You might think that Murmansk is an abandoned ghost city from the Cold War era but it's actually the main Russian port at the North Sea which remains ice-free during the winter, with a population of over 350k people.

There are shit neighbourhoods in every city in the world more or less. Shall I link now pictures and videos from Detroit ? From gypsy neighbourhoods in european cities ?

3941,"The Franco-German alliance, its depth and strength, are *mostly* independent of Germany getting a permanent UNSC seat, which I agree is pretty unlikely. Yes, the two countries heavily coordinating in their behavior as permanent members of the UNSC would deepen the alliance somewhat but in the grand scheme of things that doesn't strike me as a major factor on the strength and power of that alliance.

I think the two countries reaffirming a wish to get Germany a permanent seat is partly flattery on France's part, partly a reflection of Germany's relative political power (to France and the UK who have permanent seats) and partly an arguable overvaluing of one's own importance (of both France and Germany) relative to Europe but also the World en large. 

So while not purely symbolic, Germany wanting a permanent seat is actually not that important, for itself or the Franco-German alliance. And if a country wants to limit the power of Germany and or of that alliance then focusing on that aim to get the seat (as distant as it is) is missing the larger picture - that the Franco-German alliance, its depth and the power which it creates, is almost entirely dependent on different factors, chief among them how coordinated the two countries are politically, economically and how deep they embrace each other culturally, or not.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/ajmvke/france_germany_making_fun_of_us_with_treaty_on_un/eeytk8n/,Nuranon,1548454714

In reality, identities of the modern Balkan states have changed considerably from their original meanings.

4046,"&gt; Are fishsticks sold in Germany exactly the same as in France? No one asked that question. 

I don't speak French, but I speak British English. So I went to the website of BirdsEye (basically Iglo), and lo and behold. Cod fish sticks contain 58% fish. The ones Iglo sells in Germany contain 65%. 

I doubt that many people care. They don't think about Germany when buying something. When I buy Heinz Ketchup I don't think about how it's different form the American version. When I buy Irish butter I don't think about the version the Ires eat. I try to figure out if it's a quality product that fulfils my needs. 

In Eastern Europe the main problem isn't the objective quality of the food. It's that it's worse than Western Europe (read: Germany). 

&gt; If not, why not (maybe consumer preferences?)

The only reason why Germany has 65% fish in its fish sticks is because of the customer expectation guidelines. In test they found out that compared to a decade or two ago, the fish content approaches 65% minus tolerance pretty closely. Back in the day they put more fish in it because production technology couldn't guarantee that they'll end up with 65% minus tolerance. Nowadays they can get pretty close to the target, so they'll do that. Because less fish is cheaper. 

But consumer preferences might be an interesting but impossible to prove point, even for ""obvious"" quality differences like fish content in fish sticks. I actually like the thick batter of ""baked fish sticks"", they only contain 49% fish.

4266,"\&gt; I understand all that, I am just not sure that Portugal for example sees in their interest to enter into a conflict with Turkey or Russia over things that they don't necessarily consider their national interest.

You understand that protecting the EU is in their national interest, right?

\&gt; At some point some issues will be decided by vote, the idea that people in other countries vote for your security interests is a bit troubling. 

I grew up in Northern Ireland. Britain decided to use my national army to murder my people and oppress us for 40 years. This is not what that concern looks like.

\&gt; You might have good neighbors, would you let them vote for your immediate interests?

See above. Even with my history, I'm all for an EU Army, because it protects something I \*want\* to protect with values I \*want\* protecting, including making sure poor people in Estonia don't have to worry about Russian tanks ploughing through their homes, and Greeks don't have to worry about Turkey landing ships on their shorefront.

\&gt; I mean most of the times they would vote with you if that's their interest too, but who knows, why chance it?

Reductionism and fearmongering are a poor arguement. Why trust the man in another country? Another province? Another city? Another street? Why trust someone living in another room? I can't know what they're thinking - they're not me. I should live in fear and paranoia. 

That's Russian thinking. That's not worth fighting for.

\&gt; Wasn't there a poll that Germans would not like to send their army in another country even if NATO invoked article 5? 

Do you have the poll? I don't want to comment on something you're only half-remembering.

The current agreement solves that, and it also solves the ""historical appropriation"" issues which is what caused me to object with the name so i'm fine with that deal and the name of North Macedonia.

Secondo te non è ridicolo chiedere che le colline del prosecco diventino patrimonio dell'umanità?
E' chiaro che se avessimo successo sarebbe un vantaggio per la zona e sarebbe stupido chiedere di cancellarne uno, ma come ho detto è una logica pubblicitaria, più che legata alla conservazione del bene.

Se io ti chiedessi 100€ sarei ridicolo ciò non toglie che se tu per qualche motivo (politico, o la volontà di far contenti tutti i paesi che contribuiscono al tuo bilancio) decidessi di darmeli, i 100 euro, io ci guadagnerei.

Sul significato di ""ben conservato"" dovremmo metterci d'accordo. Secondo te il patrimonio archeologico romano è ben conservato? Pompei? Venezia? Le ville Palladiane? TUTTE? 
Certo, un crimine come come quello fatto alla grande moschea di La Mecca sarebbe impossibile sotto le regole dell'UNESCO, ma il nostro patrimonio culturale nazionale è già protetto da leggi non troppo diverse da quelle che regolano l'UNESCO.

Quello che io chiedo, è che l'UNESCO, quando si trova a giudicare cos'è un patrimonio dell'umanità giudichi se quel bene dovrebbe avere valore per veramente tutti gli umani su questa terra. 
Mi accontenterei anche che l'UNESCO rispondesse a Zaia: ""Smettila, mona"".

4438,"Duopoly in Poland is reinforced with the system.

**We use d'Hondt method to count seats in parliment.** Therfore it pays off to vote on the largest parties.

Long story short - party witch 40% support would have more parlimentarists than 2 parties with 20 % each taken together.

Currenttly situation looks like that.

PiS - goes for majority (absolute) - polls indicate that they will either get it - or they would lack few votes.

PO - main opposition pary - lacks around 15 % to Pis

Who else is there ?

\- Left  - around 5%

\- Biedroń - around 8-9 %

\- Modern - 3% (treshold is 5%

\- PSL - around 5 %

\- Kukiz - around 7-8 %

&amp;#x200B;

Kukiz is probable coalitiant of PiS.  

Also many smaller parites( Nowoczesna, PSL, SLD) might not make it to treshold. 

Another thing is - Poland never had standing coalition of more than 2 parties. Creating 'anti-PiS"" coalition of 4 or more parties would be a nightmare.

Also -there are few extreame right sided parties with around 6-7 % suport in total - those people might vote Kukiz o PiS to make it matter)

4459,"The explanation:  https://warontherocks.com/2019/01/jaw-jaw-how-america-got-china-wrong/

One of the things that I’ve written in the last couple years is that there was this theory about U.S. China policy that if we had this right combination of policies that essentially we could prevent a China challenge. That it would both be constrained from and choose not to challenge the United States in Asia and in the world. What that strategy never had was an answer to the question of what do you do when China steps outside that box of expectations and once started seeing that, once China for instance started building islands in the South China Sea and then turning them into military bases, there was nothing in that strategic framework to answer the question of what do you do with a China that’s operating wholly outside that system, because the whole strategy was predicated on preventing it from engaging in activities like that in the first place.

Brad: Well it raises two interesting questions for me. One is about how consensus in foreign policy is developed and specifically about maybe the Obama administration where you were deputy national security advisor to the vice president. I worked at the Department of Defense and saw a lot of discussions about China there.

But to the first matter. One of the things that increasingly people talk about, Ben Rhodes called it the blob and he was talking mostly about Iraq and Afghanistan and perhaps our counter-terror policies. But it seems in some ways if you accept that critique of Washington and how our foreign policy experts think, the same thing could be said about China. You had a bipartisan consensus in lots of ways of people who believed that China would go in a more peaceful arc. That’s been contradicted in the last couple of years. So how did so many smart people, area experts, people who speak Mandarin who devoted their whole career to studying China seemingly get it so wrong?

Ely: Well, I think my judgment would be that although I was calling balls and strikes differently over the last several years, I do think the evidence was ambiguous enough that smart people were doing smart analysis predicting that China was going to develop in a certain direction in part because I think there was a belief as well that this was in China’s interest or at least in the interest of the Chinese people and that’s probably true, right? The types of economic reforms that U.S. policymakers were trying to get China to do for instance during the Obama administration in the long run for sure would be in the interest of the Chinese people, although potentially not in the near-term interest of the Chinese Communist Party.

So I think you had smart people who were well-intentioned. I don’t think there was enough a debate about these issues and frankly, I think there was just a very deeply embedded paradigm and I think this is potentially more sort of a sociological or academic argument about the role of paradigms in theory and thought and less maybe about a China specific case, but I think there was a dominant narrative, it had enough evidence to support it and it was driven by a set of assumptions that people held so deeply, people who really came of age during that post-Cold War period who saw the world through that frame of American primacy and again, going back to some of those concepts about the direction of the world and the developing world was inevitably heading in, that the idea that there was going to be a return to great power competition for instance or that there was gonna be a zigzag back to a rise of authoritarians challenging the United States was just beyond people’s basic assumptions about the direction of the world.",,/r/europe/comments/ajo01r/chinas_new_policy_on_the_european_union_a/eex51vk/,morphogenes,1548418554

4629,"&gt; One person rejecting the offer doesn't change the outcome.

You don't understand how it works. The industry doesn't decide to make one golden necklace and then finds someone to buy it.

The company estimates how much people would buy their golden necklace (through survey, empirical data, history of sales, market share, etc.), then produces that number of golden necklaces to meet the demand. If they estimated that 35.000 persons would buy one, but in the end they only sell 25.000 necklaces because actually, 10.000 decided it was better for the environment not to buy it, they'll end up with too many necklaces. Storing stuff is costly, producing stuff even more. That means that next time they are producing a golden necklace, they'll use that data in addition to what they already had, and they'll produce fewer necklaces, leading to a reduction in wastes.

4674,"&gt;Did I claim they will reach US level of homicides? Just that with more guns that homicide rate will increase

Proofs? We are not discussing the US. The Swiss and Czech homicide rates are much lower than France with much laxer laws. Keep sidestepping this and going back to the US.

&gt;Funny thing, the whole point of this thread, I don't have to deal with it: The Swiss have to deal with it not being a right in EU.

That's why there will br a vote.

&gt;Also thank you for proving my point with UK data. UK Homicide rate in 2016 (last data in UN site) was lower than it was on 1997. There was a sharp increase 2 years after 1997, which you attribute to the gun ban. I suppose in 2002 they changed the gun laws again.

They actually did not change the laws in 2002. To entertain your ppint, the homicide rates were all higher for a full decade than the year before the ban (1996). I never said the ban caused it, but the laws were useless.

&gt;There are no border controls in Schengen. The periphery countries still have borders to the non Schengen countries. Nowadays it's Hungary (tough on immigrants! maybe not so tough on gun smugglers), in the past it was Austria.

&gt;This is the whole point reduce the total number of guns inside the Scengen zone so you only have to deal with the smuggled guns. Which were also not created to be smuggled to the EU. Yet it did happen eventually.

Thanks to the lack of border controls, smuggling is made much easier. Guns sourced from the Schengen are rarely used in crime. It is almost all from Eastern Europe. How will this directive reduce crime or terrorism again? 

&gt;A slippery slope to what? Also Canada is your country, you can do as you (all) please. We are talking about EU here (and Switzerland that wants to have open borders with it). There is no compromise here either.

European nations already have permitting and licensing to obtain guns and checks. The left will use any excuse to impose restrictions when there are simply no issues.

&gt;The lawsuit was on 2017. 2006 homicide rate 1.3. 2016 rate 0.6. Similar gun laws since 1995. It's not the gun law that brought Czechia murder rates among the lowest in EU.

I never said the laws caused the decrease. Why does Switzerland and the Czech Republic have some of the lowesr homicide rate if they have liberal gun laws as opposed to France or the UK?

How would it work varies a lot. The ‘EU army’ is broad. Personally I’d see it working as a army loyal to the Commission rather than national governments. The EU army would be the Federal Army of the USA and the national armies the State Militias.  
  
The other idea I see likely is France+ where the EU army works similar to NATO forming command structures but instead of USA leading the way France does. I imagine this is how most French see the idea too as France is by far the most likely to assume this role (especially with Brexit).  
  
How would if operate is another big question. If the EU recruits then it could be seen as a Eastern Meat Grinder, the wages would have to be set at something, and the wages will always look more tempting for those from poor parts of the EU. If it is recruited national and then Companies/Regiments/Squads whatever I given to the Eu I imagine it’d be hell for moral, given you make a third of the infantryman to your right despite outranking him and are expected to do the same job.

4938,"I'm very sure I saw this last year. At least the numbers seem familiar. However I may not be able to find the original post.

From the previous post the problem was pointed out as: ""Everything that is picked up as garbage, is waste"". As for Denmark which is numbers one, there is an automatic garbage collecting system that everyone is a part of. You can dispose of by far most things through this system. You are already paying into the system through taxes, and it is free when actually using it. Whether it's building materials or leftover garden branches it is all counted as waste because it is handled by the official waste disposal service.  

Every country has a different waste disposal system and a different view of what they consider waste. While western and northern europe produce more waste the details depend on the countries individual systems. This map does in no way reflect this.

When France invoked it after the 2015 attacks in Paris many countries did next to nothing, the Swedish contribution was an increase in staff officer present in Mali plus a shorter deployment of C130's to the country. This was tragically more than many others contributed. Following the fine words of aid and assistance by all means of ones power, the article also states says: “This shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states.”

My point is that in Nato, participation in any activities outside the compulsory collective defence via article 5 is entirely voluntary. Meanwhile the very nature of a common EU military , having given up control of ones national armed forces etc to the EU, would involve any participants of said project in whatever conflicts the EU chooses to engage in, be it actual defensive ones or interventions. Also, for it to be a functional military and furthermore an actual deterrence you would need a fuckton of time.

&gt;1. The Secretary of State may by order direct the holding of a poll for the purposes of section 1 on a date specified in the order.

&gt;2. Subject to paragraph 3, the Secretary of State shall exercise the power under paragraph 1 if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland.

Winter = more cloud cover = fewer hours of sunshine. 
The opposite in the summer. 

Then there is the number of daylight hours. Northernmost countries will have very long days in summer, and short ones in winter. And I know that yearround this balances out to the (roughly) same amount of daytime hours everywhere. 

Now, what does not balance out is the amount of winter/summer hours taken to get the average number of sunshine hours. This means that northernmost countries will be biased toward summer conditions (when days are considerably longer). 

If one was to calculate the daily proportion of sunshine hours to the daily number of daytime hours, the result could be very different.

I interprete his statement as ""Europe will become basically one culture"". What's the real difference between a Serb and an Austrian? basically nothing except the native language.  The difference are just an imagination of beeing so different. Of course there are some traditional cultural habits, but they might mix well together. 

And about eastern countries: They have stared from a lower level so it's not that surprising that they grow faster now embeeded in the EU. But sooner or later, when they want to continue to grow they will also need immigration. 

&gt;In what way is western Europe successful because of immigration? Look at France, people have been protesting for months now because of low wages and worsening standards of living. They don't seem to be loving globalization that much.

True. Immigration causes problems. But no immigration can cause even more. It very much depends on how it's handled. What people often forget: Companies my choose their location quite freely.

Russia turned into an adversary again over the last couple of years, so whatever piece of information comes from their side, is to be treated with caution. And as part of the already existing NATO mutual assistance clause, we already know what happens when you poke one member state with a stick.

See, that's the point. All the EU member states are already part of the NATO. So whatever the EU is coming up with in terms of military integration, it won't add anything new to the mix.

Nothing, they just don't have any gain from implementing such a system.

&gt; and why will that go away?

Because of the fucking directive that demands companies monitor the uploads of their users.

&gt; Furthermore, if member states don't prevent the use of automated extensive filtering, surely one could argue they don't comply with the directive?

Aren't member states supposed to interpret the directive as they wish for their legislative system. Also the directive says that companies  should avoid automated extensive filtering, right? Well ""should"" doesn't mean ""don't"".

What's a worse outcome is if a country adopts very strict laws while abiding to the directive, what's stopping the company from saying ""Sorry our site is no longer accessible within your country."" Nothing really.

So governments, fearing anger from their citizens because they can't access their favourite sites, will likely just let companies implement an automatic system and give the middle finger to the directive's text.

Yes there is always someone ""outside"" the law which would be the point of sovereignty for which the law is arbitrary as it has no intrinsic authority.

You cannot escape human sovereignty even if someone desgined a strong AI with an extremely detailed version of the US constitution as protocol the one who designed that system would in fact be sovereign.

Now you can argue that Uber drivers are that, since you book them through the app and the come to you. But at the same time, it is obviously a public service since everyone can just use it whenever they want on the street. And such a license is a lot cheaper compared to a normal taxi license, which is unfair.

Requiring taxis to have an appointment is not that strange. Otherwise you can have dozens of taxis driving randomly around town trying to pick people up. It can create chaos, more cars on the road and situations where taxis fight between themselves for the customer. So you can just order one, or go to a taxi place and jump in. Having them in a central place like that where the first one in line gets the customer saves on a lot of trouble.

Uber has a tradition of just coming to a country, ignore the rules and try to get the authorities to look the other way or to change regulation for them after the fact. It's a scummy company.

5420,"&gt; If they'd have said before the first one: ""this referendum is legally binding"", would you still want a second referendum?

What if they'd made it legally binding and Remain won? What if... What if... If it had been legally binding, then I believe that the outcome should have been honored. What that outcome would have been... nobody knows.

&gt; Were you actually in the UK at the time of the referendum? It may not be legally binding but it was much more than an opinion poll.

Yes I was in the UK at the time. It's not legally binding so it can't be anything more than an opinion poll. The government didn't and still doesn't have to go through with it if they don't want to. This affects turnout because some people would believe it to be pointless if the government has no obligation to carry out a result that they did not want.

&gt; As to politicians wasting time and money, a second referendum would just be an even bigger waste of time and money.

Money well spent. Leavers didn't have a clue what they were voting for at the time because nobody knew. Now that the negotiations have been completed and the damage it will do to the UK sovereignty had become very apparent, there should be another opinion poll about it, to see if it's still what everyone wants.

5424,"&gt; In fact, most US bombing was done in daylight because the US was trying to hit factories. The US aircrews took huge losses. Burning down cities was more of a Euroepan thing, invented by the Germans, and perfected by the British. They bombed at night, when a city was all you could hope to hit.

So you think the reason for the RAF bombing at night and the US AF bombing during the day was because the US had morals and the Brits didnt? This made me actually laugh IRL. Fact remains, 80% of the war the only noticable thing the US did in europe was the carpent bombing of German cities (civilians).

The US profited heavily from both wars both economically and more importantly geo strategically (this will not make sense to you but ill just had to add it) while leaving the bloodshed to their allies.  (France/UK WW1, Soviet Union WW2). 

&gt; I guess you should stay angry. It is the only reason we are in Europe.

You mean Kosovo? They are not even part of the EU and as European as the Turks as far as I am concerned. Also this was hardly more than a local /civil war type of conflict and absolutely not comparable to a conflict between two european nation states. There hasnt been an armed conflict between different nations in europe since WW2, but of course only because the US having a couple of air bases in germany.

This is an unhappy lexical invention based on an ignorant and infantile logic: if you have two things of a sort, of which one is deemed as big/great, the other one must necessarily be diminutive: big apple-little apple, big boy-little boy. This is kindergarten mentality.

The fact that we celebrate our ""Great Union"" doesn't make ""little"" by any means our ""Principalities Union"".

After the  march last month (with the 75.000 people), Belgium voted against an important EU climate directive and abstained in another one.

5656,"Those UK newspapers makes the claim that the EU is throwing away money to nonsense projects.

&gt; In a drive to have a go at the EU, on 20 July some UK newspapers (Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail) chose to ridicule circus artists and coconut production. The articles call funding for deprived communities in some of the poorest parts in the world “frivolous expenditure” and illustrate their point with photos of appealing beaches and young female acrobats in glittering outfits.

The EU goes on to explain why these project are not frivolous expenditure and how they actually help the people poor countries, refuting the claim of these UK newspapers.

&gt; Elaborate metaphors and frivolous choice of visuals aside, mastering – to quote the articles – “the art of the trapeze” can open job opportunities for a person in Tanzania (by the way, the same project also provides courses in carpentry and sewing). Exotic sounding Caribbean destinations are often poor countries where coconuts don’t grow on supermarket shelves, but their production provides livelihoods.

Then the EU goes on to explain everything else the fund has achieved, of which the above examples are only a very small part. The newspapers failed to properly mention those achievements, instead portraying the project as frivolous. This is generally known as lying by omission. 

&gt; The articles fail to share with their readers salient facts about the fund achievements, for example: since 2004 more than 13 million children have been enrolled in primary education, 18 million children under one have been immunised against measles, 70 million people have been connected to better drinking water while 24 million have been connected to sanitation facilities. To quote but a few in a long list of examples.

In comments on Austrian public television on Tuesday evening Kickl was asked if his proposals for harsher procedures for asylum seekers would contravene the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and other international commitments.
Kickl replied that in his opinion there were some “strange legal structures — sometimes many years old and developed in totally different circumstances — which prevent us from doing what is necessary,” adding: “I would like to take those rules on.”
“I believe in the principle that law should follow politics and not the other way round,” he said.

Video excerpt of the interview: https://twitter.com/DieRaffa/status/1087820874592514051?s=19

Because of the second quote and the fact that the Human Rights and the ECHR in particular are part of our constitution, the Opposition has accused him of threatening the rule of law Wednesday (23 January). Some people have thought for a long time that Kickl doesn't support the idea of ""all people have the same rights"".

In a reaction, even Justice Minister Josef Moser emphasised that in a “state of law, the law is always supreme”. Moser is a former Freedom Party politician himself, who joined ruling conservative ÖVP recently.

“Calling the ECHR into question would mean the end of the fundamental consensus underlying the Second Republic,” President Van der Bellen said, referring to Austria’s post-war system of government.",Austria,/r/europe/comments/ajay6m/austrias_interior_minister_calls_european_human/eeu1v13/,ChrisTinnef,1548324437

5833,"Well first off your comparing the capital city of a country like Prague to whatever part of the US you're from. There are in fact more rundown parts of the Czech Republic. I'm from Louisiana which has shitty roads, but now I live in New York where everything is nice and funded. In rural Louisiana nobody would think twice of letting a derelict building lie derelict, but it would be just as crazy to not rebuild a piece of land in a major city like Prague as it would be in in New York.

&amp;#x200B;

All the Eastern European countries have way lower income tax rates. But Western European countries have much larger tax burdens than anything comparable in the US. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also more importantly, is that European countries in general raise a tremendous amount of money from VAT. Louisiana has the highest sales tax in the US at 10%, which is still half of the Czech Republic's 20% VAT rate, which is the European average. But you don't notice those taxes when you pay them because they don't appear on your tax return. These are European countries which get like 1/3 of all their revenue from sales/VAT taxes. 

&amp;#x200B;

And poor and lower income people pay way higher sales or VAT taxes, because they spend a much larger share of their income. These are regressive taxes that fall on the poor hardest. This is convenient because it's an easy way to raise revenue without people noticing as much as when you bump up their income tax, even though it's even more regressive.",,/r/europe/comments/aj06qk/total_social_spending_as_of_gdp_in_oecd/eetxt68/,sandyhands2,1548318159

5836,"&gt; Nuclear is too expensive to build that you could use it for load balancing.

That's why nobody uses  nuclear *for* load balancing. On the other hand, nuclear reactors are  very good at followind demand, even if you don't save money by lowering the output. That's a reason why where pumped storage is an option, reactors run full-time at near capacity.

That's also the reason why, in a country that *already* has an up-and running nuclear electricity capacity, investing in wind and solar makes no economical sense at all.

&gt;France has issues with electricity during winter.

Does it ? I remember *one* winter a few years ago when consumption came uncomfortably close to capacity and a few calls for electricity saving were issued. Nowhere near a blackout though. The reason was that following the Fukushima disaster, more reactors than usual were temporarily shut down for security inspection and upgrades. France still is a net exporter of electricity, and at the consumer's meter, French electricity still is half the price of the German one.

I don't know that much about the projected price of the production of the future Hinkley Point C reactor, but I understand that it is the result of a complicated financial and political scafholding to enable the investment to be entirely realized without any british public public money and be supported almost entirely by private operators, chiefly Électricité de France, which, although state-owned, runs like a commercial  company and does generate revenue for the french state.

Now, it is true that the economics of nuclear energy are a bit complicated. As you rightly remark, most of the costs are *sunk* costs. The initial investment is very big, and the *return* on investment is slow. It may take more than 20 years for a reactor to break even, and that kind of ROI rate is ill-suited for private investors under the pressure of the market to yield short-term profits. Also, nuclear demands very strict regulations and public oversight, another thing that Wall Street doesn't like.

&gt;i don't have to touch the questions about security at all.

Well, you should. How many people were killed by nuclear power plants in western countries over more than 50 years of history of nuclear electricity generation ?

half of Croatia was in ruins because of Turkish raids. Not conquered does not mean not spared. I edited the map a little and found really interesting stuff. For example Skrad was literally destroyed. But it's shown as not conquered by Turks. Ottomans besieged Karlovac 7 times. I don't even want to imagine the situation of the fortress. Durdevac has a interesting myth about Turkish raids.

If reality is not enoug for you though

https://www.osce.org/odihr/315946

&gt;It is generally acknowledged at the international level that judicial councils or other similar independent bodies should, however, not be composed completely or over- prominently by members of the judiciary, so as to prevent self-interest, self-protection, cronyism and also the perceptions of corporatism.35 In that respect, the composition of the Judicial Council as envisaged in Article 187 of the Constitution and in the 2011 Act ensures a mixed membership with representatives of the judiciary and non-judicial members. At the same time, and while reiterating that judges should represent a “substantial element or a majority” of judicial councils’ members, regional bodies, including the OSCE/ODIHR, the Venice Commission and the CCJE, generally recommend a greater inclusion of lay members in such bodies to avoid the risk of corporatism and add a certain level of external, more neutral control36 (see also recommendations in pars 49, 51 and 55 infra regarding the pluralistic composition of judicial councils).

However Portugal does not charge taxes on worldwide income, specially if it was taxed at the original country (very few don't have agreements), so the tax authorities could never claim you owed taxes on foreign income. There are obviously benefits from being a tax resident in the country you actually work and reside, besides being the right thing imo (paying tax in the country that actually ""employs"" you).

Also even if you take temporary employment in another EU country (if you're a freelancer for instance) you can present a EU-wide form from the tax authority you're resident with, which obliges the paying party to not withhold any taxes on your income. The premise is that you'll be charged at your home country (where you have tax residency), so the foreign EU country paying you has no right to withhold taxes.",,/r/europe/comments/aiztb1/how_many_russians_are_leaving_russia/eettquz/,william_13,1548312734
