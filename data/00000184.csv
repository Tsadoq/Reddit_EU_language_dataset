0,"&gt;If your people were not Ruthenians, then why was their language called Ruthenian?

It's not an ethnicity, for the 2000 time. 

&gt;Same word. This is like saying there is a difference between England and Angliya.

But a different place. Rus is modern day Ukrainian and Belarus. Grand Dutchy of Moscow is modern day   Russia. 

&gt;Modern Ukraine and Belo-Russia were called Little Russia in 1361 :D :D :D

That was the case under the Russian empire, while people on that land were calling themselves Ukrainians. Just because the Russian empire was calling us that doesn't mean it had any valid basis. 

&gt;The people of Moscow called themselves Rus' before the Mongol invasions, during the Mongol invasion, and after the Mongol invasion.

Doesn't mean they were. Andrey Bogolyubsky wanted Rus. So in 1162 he came to Kyiv and plundered the city. His father Yuri was the founder of Moscow, which he founded after he didn't receive any land from on land of Rus. Yuri build his own separate dynasty which became the Grand Dutchy of Moscow. 

&gt;Grand Duchy of Moscow was just a polity. It decided to go by the name Rus'/Russia because that name was more appropriate after the duchy contained non-Moscovian territories.

No, Grand Dutchy of Moscow is appropriate because Moscow was build 1st in the creation of this dynasty. Russia should be called Moscowia bacause Moscow was the 1st city build. 

&gt;but the local people called their land Rus' and they all identified as Russian so it made sense to use a name that was applied to all the duchy's citizens.

Show me where in history they referred to themselves as Russians? The only place i heard it was in Russian cartoon about Rus tha falsely refer to Rus as Russia land. 

There is no proof of Ruthernian ethnicity and you won't ever find it. Ruthernians were people who were under Rus, united slavic tribes. We are not ethically ralated. There is no Ruthernian gene. Even slavic is not even an ethnic concept. The only thing that we share is R1a, but so do people of Pakistan, Iran and Idia.

And who are *we*?

I linked you Kant and his categorical imperative, or a law of morality that's both an absolute requirement from every reasonable being (therefore, the opposite of moral relativism) *and* without an external higher source (because its source is pure practical reason, which is internal to reasonable beings).

124,"&gt;Why did you make a post about a Bulgarian church in instanbul by the way? Was it to show how tolerant Turks are? Because I hope that you know, that there are countless counter-examples that indicate that Turks can be quite intolerant as well.

Why not? What the fuck is wrong with posting this? I swear this sub specializes in demonizing us no matter what. What’s so hard to let a post about Turkey fly? Does it have to be “Armenian Genocide” and “All Turks bad” rhetoric all the time on a Turkish post? You don’t see me commenting “The Holocaust” in every German and Austrian post. You don’t see me commenting “British Raj” for every British post. You don’t see me bring up Haiti every time a someone posts something about France. You don’t see me bringing up the Bosnian Genocide for every Serbian post. 

Like honestly, if you don’t like the post, downvote it and fuck off. If people are going to demonize me over the Armenian Genocide even though I recognize it, then what is the point even recognizing it? I could easily just laugh off how people who hate Turkey so much that they MUST bring up the Armenian Genocide every fucking time. 

&gt;And I’m beginning to think that you are not so different from the turkish nationalists.

I’m an outspoken critic of Erdogan. But that must not be enough because I am Turkish so I am automatically genocidal. Even recognizing terror groups like the PKK makes me genocidal.

&gt;Why is it so important, that no matter what, the Turks have to be always on top?

Never brought that up. Don’t know where you are spitting that crap up. Literally 95% of Turkey posts don’t get any traction in this sub. I happily participate on posts from other countries and I don’t constantly try to shit on them for upvotes. Even on Greek posts, I don’t randomly bring up how some Greek nationalists are so insecure about their Greekness to the point where they try  to economically destroy their neighbor North Macedonia. I make those posts myself because it is a separate topic at many given moments.

&gt;Because I hope that you know, that there are countless counter-examples that indicate that Turks can be quite intolerant as well.

149,"&gt;Violent uprisings have no place in a modern democracy, thats the entire point of having a democracy. Your rights aren't being trampled, your ideology just doesn't have majority support.

That is simply bullshit for a variety of reasons.

Firstly because majority support does not make something ok, for example (purely as an example) if say a democratic state voted to set up concentration camps for some minority group then regardless of democratic support a good citizen should use violence if so necessary to prevent it.

Secondly because Democracy is not a perfect describer of popular will at all.

Thirdly because elected candidates can violate their promises and thus invalidate the reasons they were elected.

Fourthly because democracy can become a bludgeon used against minority groups, for example in say Iraq where the religious majority used their democracy to implement sectarian policies that violate equal treatment, just because you are say 40% of the population does not mean you have to tolerate being legislatively abused (this goes for minority groups in terms of race, sexuality, religion etc.).",,/r/europe/comments/arne0k/what_its_like_to_drive_a_police_car_surrounded_by/egpapxk/,Toparov,1550456220

The inegalities are growing everywhere, this is a well documented fact.

The movement started as a protest against the increase of the ecotax on the fuel, they were only two problems with that:

-almost none of the money of the so called ""ecotax"" was going to finance an actual energetic transition

-no structural alternatives are offered to a lot of people than the use of their car. Development in France made it that people living outside big cities need their car to survive so this tax hit them particularly hard on top of other problems like the defection of most infrastructure from the rural areas or the suppression of a French taxe on particularly important income that was supposed to bring back investments which didn't so far.

It is about time to stop doing short term politics and actually try to see the world in it's great complexity. Our failing political systems around the world are in a really frightening position of wait and see and it might be the time for us as a society to evolve.

180,"&gt; It's not an ethnicity, it's a region, stupid

The region is Eastern Europe. The ethnicity is Russian/Ruthenian. Its a word used for East Slavic-speakers since forever!

&gt; And the name Romania came from Rome. Just because Russian empire took on the name doesn't mean its accurate. It was Moscowia, and it started from Moscow not Rus.

It was called Russia before the Mongols destroyed it. Then it returned to its original name after Moscow reunified most of the Russian lands.

Romania did not have its name before Italians gave them that name.

&gt; You haven't showed me or have proven to me that at all. There is no East slavic ethnicity. There is no Ruthernian ethnicity either. It was a region composed of diffrent tribes. If I'm wrong I'm waiting for you to prove me otherwise. Don't talk about not being taken seriously when you say bs like that.

Wow. The Dregovichs, Krivichs, Radimichs, Tiverians, and other East Slavic tribes all got assimilated into the Russian/Ruthenian identity during the Middle Ages and they were all known as Russian/Ruthenian for centuries.

I am baffled I have to teach you about your own country. Ukrainian propaganda is worse than I thought. The name Ruthenian was used in English sources as a translation of the Latin name to refer to East Slavs and their language that was part of the PLC. This is why the name Old Ruthenian is used for older varieties of your language when you were part of the PLC.

&gt; &gt; Ruthenian is seen as a predecessor of modern Belarusian, Rusyn and Ukrainian. Indeed, all these languages, from Old East Slavic to Rusyn, have been labelled as Ruthenian (Ukrainian: **Рутенська** мова, **русинська** мова) at some point in history.

Russian Ruthenian. Tomayto Tomahto. Ruthenian was name used to describe the ethnicity of East Slavs under PLC occupation. The OP should write ""Ruthenian (Russian)"" in his map.

Ukrainian alt-history. Ruthenia is just a Latinization of the Byzantine name Russia. Other names are Ruzzia, Ruscia, and Roxolania. In some sources, the name Russia is given and in other sources the name Ruthenian is given. Both refer to the same region.

&gt; &gt; **The word Ruthenia originated as a Latin rendering of the region and people known originally as the Rus'**. During the Middle Ages, the term was applied to lands inhabited by Eastern Slavs[3] in regions of ancient Ruthenia distinctly not under the influence of Tsarist Russia, such as Carpathian Ruthenia, Red Ruthenia, Black Ruthenia, and White Ruthenia. **Russia itself was called Great Ruthenia or White Ruthenia** until the end of the 17th century.[4] It is mentioned in the 1520 Latin treatise Mores, leges et ritus omnium gentium, per Ioannem Boëmum, Aubanum, Teutonicum ex multis clarissimis rerum scriptoribus collecti by Johann Boemus. In the chapter De Rusia sive Ruthenia, et recentibus Rusianorum moribus (""About Rus', or Ruthenia, and modern Rus' customs""), Boemus tells of a country extending from the Baltic Sea to the Caspian Sea and from the Don River to the northern ocean. It is a source of beeswax, its forests harbor many animals with valuable fur, and the capital city Moscow (Moscovia), named after the Moskva River (Moscum amnem), is 14 miles in circumference.[5][6] Danish diplomat Jacob Ulfeldt, who traveled to Russia in 1578 to meet with Tsar Ivan IV, **titled his posthumously (1608) published memoir Hodoeporicon Ruthenicum (""Voyage to Ruthenia"").**[7]

242,"&gt;My comment a little up the chain includes polling data.

Cheers. That does seem to be completely at odds with the EB data. Not going to check for the methodology, but just going to point out that both [YouGov](https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2017/06/05/yougov-s-polls-are-no-longer-just-wrong-they-re-irresponsible) and the [EB](https://www.mpifg.de/pu/mpifg_dp/dp15-6.pdf) have received staunch criticism of their methodology.

&gt;That article is almost 5 years old, uses the Euro-barometer questions on integration as a vague equivalent to support for a federal EU. I'd argue that's flawed (and indeed that the actual polling makes that clear). 

Indeed it is 5 years old, however [opinion of the EU has only improved since Brexit](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/9quelt/support_for_the_eu_before_and_after_brexit/) across the board, and the question could not be more specifically about federation:

&gt;13.THE FUTURE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
13.1. Opinions on a federation of Nation-States
41% of Europeans (-4 percentage points since autumn 2013) agree with the idea that “the EU should develop further into a federation of Nation-States”, while 34% (-1) disagree. The “don’t know” rate on this subject is high and has increased (25%, +5)57.

I have not been able to find more recent data.

&gt;For context, I'm Eurosceptic and am happy to see the UK leave the EU, but I also think that there are areas where the EU needs to integrate more effectively and more deeply.

That seems like a contradictory opinion to have since if the EU is a good thing, you can logically conclude you'd want the UK to be in it. Having said that though, that's fair enough, I welcome a difference of opinion. 👍

261,"I'd opt for the first solution, outright banning feels too strict. Maybe it would be possible to just tax those royalties and subcontract sums appropriately? Common sense would demand that if a company does business in a country, it should pay taxes in said country. I know the lines get blurry with the internet and doing business online between two multinationals. I wouldn't be surprised if companies would resort to using cryptocurrency at one point to avoid taxation. That's why so many countries discourage or outright ban the use of those.

Fairer redistribution is on the one hand raising taxes for the richest. It used to be quite normal until fairly recently that the richest would pay a, say, 70% income tax (feels outrageous but if you think about the money they make, they still have more than enough for a lifetime). Hopefully with a more stringent law on offloading profits government budgets would allow for better social security, healthcare, education and so on.

Transparent wages are already in use in some countries as well. Politicians need to make their earnings public, too. With people knowing how much everyone earns there would be more pressure on companies to pay people more fairly. Of course, they have ways of gaming the system with lots of fancy names for positions, I can imagine segmenting workers into junior, senior and so on positions in the workplace (just like they do now) and differentiating their pay solely on that. It could still potentially curb the gender pay gap (at least in theory, because each male and female in the same position would have to earn the same). There have been ideas of imposing a maximum wage just like there is a minimum wage (not sure if those would stop CEOs from taking ludicrous bonuses, however), Roosevelt proposed one in the 1940s.

Lower wages for the highest ranking employees could potentially benefit the economy and companies because they'd have more money to operate. They would be able to invest into acquiring assets, R&amp;D or just hire more employees.

Macron basically has free reign for 5 years ; and since he came into office, he repeatedly ignored intermediary bodies, which are precisely there to make the junction with the governement and the population.

In 2016, the previous government passed a law which brought [nearly 400 000](https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2016/03/31/plusieurs-dizaines-de-milliers-de-personnes-defilent-contre-le-projet-de-loi-travail_4893325_823448.html) people in the streets at the highest of the protestation, with [roughly 71% of the population supporting the protesters](https://www.lesechos.fr/18/07/2016/lesechos.fr/0211136232435_sondage---les-francais-rejettent-toujours-autant-la-loi-travail.htm) in France.

Not only the government did not back out, but they also used their constitutional power to force MPs to either vote the law or call a vote of no confidence against the whole cabinet no less than three times during the parliamentary debates. Such a vote of no confidence happened once, with 246 votes for out of the 288 required to be adopted.

Fast forward, within a matter of months Macron came out as a deception to a lot of people. He is now percieved as [out of touch with reality, favoring the wealthiest with his policies, and arrogant](https://elabe.fr/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/20190130_elabe_bfmtv_les-francais-et-emmanuel-macron.pdf).

470,"Politically: Local governments in the EU countries are a bit selfish (and voters want it that way), so it's very difficult to make a decision in things like fiscal policy as every member has the right to veto. A Inner-European Tax-heaven is very likely to say ""no"" if the EU plans to implement some regulations. Note: governments in the countries complain about the EU for doing nothing when they have a problem and want a european regulation - but they complain about the EU for doing something (""Not to much Brussels - we can do better"") when they think that a proposed regulation damages their local business model (then they do not care about the problems others have).

But: That's our fault. We voters are responsible when we support ""We first"". 

Technically: Rich peopole are free to move anyway. There will always be a friendly tax heaven welcoming them with open arms. You cannot prevent people from leaving a country. That's why politicians are so submissive when it comes to the wealthy people. It's not so much about bribes. It's more like ""Ok, better tax them just a little bit here than having them go somewhere else"". So technically there are just workarounds with special rules for cross-border business. But they are difficult as it's not easy to detect if a cross-border-business is some kind of ""tax-workaround"" or just normal business. If you are too restrictive you destroy your own country (more companies leaving). If you do nothing the rich can do what they want. (Leaving the EU just prevents ""normal"" people from moving out or coming in - but not the wealthy people).

All in all: Leaving the EU is not a solution to prevent tax-competition and social dumping. Rather the contrary. Most problems we have do not exist because of the EU, but rather despite of the EU.

489,"&gt; It's so weird to me that American is given such sweeping generalizations. The US is physically massive. And people live on every part of this country. Talking to someone in Washington and someone in Alabama is like talking to two people from two different countries. I feel like foreigners often neglect this fact. 

Americans are given the same generalizations any other nations/ethnicities get. Not to be rude, but I think you overestimate how different the US is. Most countries, even if they are much smaller, are vastly different in different places. However these ""vast differences"" are quite subjective. If you only lived in this place, these two differences will be the extremes for you, however from the outside these extremes are still quite similar. Similar stuff, can be said about Germany. If somebody wouldn't have any knowledge about the outside world, and would have visited the various parts of Germany, one could also come to the conclusion that the differences are vast, however if looked from the outside the differences are rather minimal.

&gt; If California was a country it would be like Canada 2. If Mississippi were a country it would be like Liberia 2.

You are talking about the economy there. By that logic, countries like Germany, France, Italy, England would be as diverse as the whole, or almost whole, Eastern Europe.

&gt; Personally I can't stand America. We created ISIS. We invaded Iraq and we're still there ffs. We bombed innocent children in Libya and just left the whole area destabilized without a plan. Now Trump is Putin's puppet. There's a surge of racism and white supremacy.

However, since the US is a democracy, it means that the government is still more or less a reflection of what people want.

&gt; But you don't hear from most of America. I have to believe the vocal ones are the worst of it. Only 25% of Americans even voted for Trump. And less support him now. Not to mention the political elite have done everything in their power to keep their opposition from voting. I have to believe most Americans are more reasonable than the American flag boxer-warring, AR-toting, freedom-yelling nationalists.

Yes, but USA is a democracy, thus it represents it's people. For example, in Germany somebody like Trump wouldn't fly, even for most right wingers.

642,"&gt;Define ""stagnate"".

People will largely retain the socioeconomic status of their parents. Kids and schools from poor neighborhoods already underperform while kids with rich parents get access to tutors and expensive private schools. Education is vital to social mobility and there's no reason to support an already advantaged group.

&gt;When it comes to an academic context, peoples grades are by definition their merit. That is the goal and objective of education.

I think this is where you and I disagree fundamentally. You seem to think that the goal of education is a competition to find the best and brightest and help them succeed. I think it's to give everyone an equal chance to succeed in life in order to achieve a more equal society.

&gt;Indeed, your entire argument is instead to state that one should disregard the students merit, purely due to reasons outside of their control. Because that is what you are arguing for, you are arguing towards discriminating students based on the wealth of their parents

My argument is that students' merit can never be accurately assessed and shouldn't be the basis of an education system. I want to help students who have been disadvantaged through no fault of their own. If they're innate merit matters so much the best will succeed regardless, but the rest shouldn't be left behind. We live in capitalist societies. Students can compete with one another once they have started their careers and leading their own life, but they should all be given an equal chance to do so. We shouldn't be advocating for a system that systematically favours those already at the top.

&gt;Because you end up spending resources in an inefficient manner.

That is completely dependent on the goal of said spending.

&gt;So?

Why help the few when you can help everyone? 

&gt;Being irresponsible with government resources does not benefit society as a whole. You know what benefits society as a whole? Using those resources in the most efficient way possible.

Pragmatism isn't the basis of educational funding. lf being pragmatic is our goal, why try to educate poor people at all if they'll vastly underperform? Why build schools in poor neighborhoods? Why have free education?  Because it isn't a competition. Because we have to have to do everything we can to make sure those who are disadvantaged don't remain so, or we risk increasing wealth inequality and classism. A meritocracy is exactly that. It benefits no one but those at the top.

&gt;Yes, because of racist propaganda.

Who mentioned race? So far we have only been discussing wealth, not racial background. I want to help the disadvantaged. I don't care what their racial background is. If white men are being underrepresented (as the article above states) then I fully support measures to help them catch up. Race is irrelevant. All that matters is that everyone gets a chance to make something of themselves without their social status holding them back.

&gt;If you think such things are in any way acceptable, you are part of the problem.

Using merit and grades as the basis of education has completely ruined the education system in many countries, including my own, and has turned education into a complete farce. 

All of the classmates I've had who had problems at school also had problems at home and were either poor or lived in dysfunctional families where education wasn't seen as important, while those who were at the top of their class had support from family, friends and teachers, participated in competitions or social activities and never had to deal with such problems. From primary school to graduation it was always the same exact few at the top, regardless of the fact that if anyone else was in their position they'd do just as well. Because merit doesn't matter. It plays no part here. It's just dumb luck.

I'd say the reason porn industry got established here is simply largely an accident of history – a kernel formed around which the industry then developed. This was perhaps aided by the Czech's attitude (doing porn doesn't carry such a huge stigma in this country, people are not slut-shaming porn models *as much* as in more conservative societies) and the ready availability of naturally beautiful ""Caucasian"" (to use the American terminology) women.

But get real for a moment – the porn industry is tiny, utterly insignificant in comparison to the overall Czech economy. Most Czechs are not even aware Czech Republic is a major porn producer. I think it's mostly foreigners who think they can just come here and fuck any woman they want if they offer her a few Euros, which is so hilariously false it cracks me up.

719,"Marriage originally grew out of a formalisation of the agreement between men not to pursue each other's sexual partners. From there, in most cultures, it evolved into an institution by which men prevented women from having property and/or exercising their own free choice, as well as literally paying each other to buy/sell women – this is where dowries come from, and is the source of the strange rules regarding rape (and adultery) that you can find in the Bible. Until relatively recently, the crime of marital rape was considered inconceivable, or an oxymoron: rape was considered a crime against the property belonging to the woman's husband or father. In some jurisdictions, ""my husband told me to do it"" was even a solid defence in court.

If you're interested in how the status of women and marriage was seen by contemporaries during the enlightenment (~1850), and the original arguments for why marriage should be as we know it today, I would recommend reading John Stewart Mill's *On the subjugation of women*, which you can read for free on WikiSource [here](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Subjection_of_Women).",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/arj37s/status_of_samesex_marriage_in_europeeurasia/egnthmd/,CheCheDaWaff,1550412129

The city of Trieste organised itself into a comune in the middle ages just like the other cities of Italy in the same period and ever since the K.u.K. administration gave the city the chance to organise free elections in the late 1800s, the city governments were all irridentist.

I used [this](https://www.freeones.com/countries/) database as reference. I only selected the 'pornstar' category and avoided the 'adult model' one. I did that for two reasons. First, there is significant crossover. Second, not all adult models are pornstars. Some are just making nude photography and not actually having sex on camera. 


It's important to understand that the database stretches back to 1999, so this is not just *active* pornstars but anyone who was active in the last 20 years. This means that the current ranking could change somewhat but the broad trend would still remain quite similar. 

Finally, they sort the pornstars on birthplace. For instance, some pornstars are born in X country but shoot all of their scenes in another. They are still counted to their birthplace.

Russian chicks are probably more attractive on average (or roughly the same at the very least), the wages and life quality they can obtain through normal low-qualified jobs are lower are lower, yet they're absolutely nowhere near our number.

1197,"There is quite a lot written down, yeah...

What about it is ""real"" though?
Laws are made by politicians, - mostly amongst themselves - written down and usually acted upon by the governmental body.

The ""actual union"" is a bunch of big, complicated systems, lead by politicians with mostly intrinsically motivated behavior... 

The ""idea"" of an union can only really be made real by acting as such, not by simply talking about it...


Looking at the political development over the last 5 years, the ""idea"" has been heavily used to promote interventionism...

We hear about the promotion of harmonization and the protection of EU citizens and their rights, yet we got the GDPR and now Article 11&amp;13



As the mobility of highly skilled workers increases, I see more and more people planning to move away, further reducing our tendencies to stay...
There is not too much, these days, keeping people from moving where their needs are met best.
E.g. a restriction of digitalization and free internet have a much bigger impact on my personal quality of life than the minor inconvenience of people in restaurants not speaking my mother tongue...
At this point about 40% of my colleagues and roundabout 60% of the IT/tech companies I know plan to move outside the EU... 

The only people I see moving in are people who are either on the lower end of qualification or those who plan to work in the public sector


I might be subject to a big bubble bias but I'd argue if the bubble is a big chunk of the IT/tech community, it probably has quite an impact on the future of this great ""union""

They do have reasons to protest the government and feel let down, but then again every community in Spain does. Most have it worse. Spanish society has seen its means, quality of life and opportunities broadly degrade since 2008. Sure Spanish nationalist parties have played the counterpart and used low passions to deflect part of the disaffection. But the vast majority of society has been struggling with their lives rather than conspiring against Catalans

While they do have rational points of contention, I'd say that most of their arguments fall under emotional categories. Historical grievances, the fight of the people, group identity, a sense of epic, pride, symbols.

1267,"Indeed, all of the EU's members are states. Non-statal entities cannot be equal members of the EU according to the Treaties. How member states treat their constituent parts is completely up to them. Germany's federal government was forced to involve the German states in implementing EU law at the national level because that's what our constitutional order demands. If that's not the case in Spain, then - as hard as it sounds - that's not the EU's problem. You can of course think that this is bad - and I'm totally with you on that, hence I'm a federalist - but you cannot accuse the EU, as dysfunctional as it apparently is, of not doing things that it is not supposed to do.

&gt; it's going to be what it's members agree that it's going to be.

That's exactly what I said above. And the member that you live in is Spain, not Catalonia. And hence the EU cares about what the Spanish government wants because the Spanish government *is* the EU, as are the other governments. It's the heads of state and government that come together in the European Council, it's the ministers who come together in the Council of Ministers, and it's the member states' populations that elect the European Parliament. People need to understand that the EU is subordinate to the member states and not like in the US or in Germany or in Switzerland where the federation is on a par with the states.

1300,"&gt; The big offender was the claim to the legacy of Alexander the great, NOT ancient helenic legacy in general.

I'd suggest you abstain from playing with wording. We both know this is about Hellenic Macedonian legacy specifically and that includes Alexander the Great.

&gt; This has not been settled since RONM history claims that he was NOT a greek macedonian in the same way that leonidas was a greek spartan.

I'm well aware of the lies being allowed to flourish throughout the past, yet this is how you break your attachment to such cases and move forward in good will. Their constitutional amendment, the renaming of controversial national roads and airports and the placement of signs regarding the hellenism of ancient Macedon on statues of previously completely unethically claimed parts of ancient hellenic heritage are moves in the right direction.

&gt; The New globaly accepted name is meme gold...

You'll allow me to abstain from shitposting, right? That includes your 6th *point*.

&gt; The deal has no democratic legitimacy (as exibited by the results off the referandum in RONM) and a lack of referendum in greece (where the results would have been masively against the deal).

The non-binding referendum of North Macedonia was only contstitutionally a fail due to low turnout (36.89%), yet the people who did vote did so greatly in favour (94.18%) of the proposed agreement, NATO and the EU.

Failing to participate in democracy either through abstaining from ballots or neglecting the political scene is a problem. You can't just not vote and wish to criticize on whatever comes next.

&gt; The deal has very poor parliamentary legitimacy in both countries since it passed with very narrow margins on both parlaments.

The deal was backed by two thirds of the 120 MP parliament in Skopje, just as required for constitutional changes, which is no petty fraction for anything related to national identity, mind you.

The deal was backed by 153/300 greek MPs with many opponents of SYRIZA, yet supports of the deal, voting against it just so as to please the substantial part of the electorate being sceptical of the deal and/or the govt.

I have to admit most greeks are not particularly fond of the deal, yet there's a great deal of people merely being undecided on the matter and not strongly against the deal.

&gt; Add to that the rampant rummors about MP's selling their vote for money or political favors.

Much like painting non-votes and way you see fit you can't merely use corruption as a target. You should fight against it both as a govt and a citizen.

&gt; The deal does more harm than good to the relations between the countries since it is considered a bad deal by the people of both countries.

Hopefully that clarifies my credentials.

I find it funny that you think I have some sort of Macedonian agenda though (don't tell them, but I wouldn't mind if they joined Bulgaria!). I have been accused of being Albanian and Serbian in the past just because I don't have patience for nationalists. Soon I'll complete my Balkan bingo.

I recommend for you to do what I've been doing out of innocent interest: check the ""Talk"" tab of the pages concerning the question, and see the debates around it. Read the policy they came up with concerning this issue. It's pretty neat.

&gt;Inform me too if you don't mind random guy on the internet about my ""political reasons"" and my ""political ideas"". Apparently you know better than me.

Oh, the irony.

Look: neither you nor me control how Wikipedia works. I don't have an account there. I do know that they accept input from the community about their rules, as long as it is made in the appropriate places with appropriate language. So if this is such an important cause for you, study their rules and present your arguments to them. Maybe you'll change something :)

Just don't participate in all the vandalism they've been defending themselves from. And please have some self-awareness: it's obvious what moves you, and I'm pretty sure it isn't a desire to make Wikipedia better.

1339,"Just one article. Are these lies? Man. You must have big balls to try and act like Russia isn't guilty of serious crimes against the democracies of the world. And, that's a very generous description of you, your motives.

* In 2015 Russian hackers hit Germany’s parliament and stole 16 gigabytes of sensitive email data. Researchers have traced the penetration, techniques and sources of the attack to Russian-sponsored cutout hackers. Russia also funded the far right Alternative for Germany political party that gained seats and traction in the German government in the last major election.

* In France, Russia was caught funding Marine Le Pen’s National Front Party. Le Pen has taken large loans from Kremlin-backed Russian oligarchs and has spoken very favorably of Vladimir Putin. Current President Emanuel Macron, during this tumultuous election against Le Pen, had his campaign email servers hacked by Russia and sensitive emails and data published on WikiLeaks.

* In Italy, Russians funded a populist party called The Five Star Movement. The Five Star Movement has gained momentum in Italy while calling for closer ties to Russia.

* • In financially troubled Greece, there have been detailed investigations and records showing that the Syriza party has changed their foreign policy stance on Russia to be more favorable. Kremlin-tied Russian oligarchs have been buying large stakes in Greek media and energy corporations in what is essentially a de facto bailout of Greece’s economy. The Syriza party denies that they changed their stance, but their actions and the money trail say otherwise. If Russia controls the media in a country, then it can easily swing a population toward a more favorable view of Russia and Vladimir Putin.

*  Turning to the United Kingdom, Russia supported the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP). UKIP heavily supported Brexit, UK’s movement to leave the European Union. British intelligence confirmed that Russians also tried to hack into UK government servers, which prompted Prime Minister Theresa May to publicly call out Vladimir Putin for this event.

* Spain isn’t immune either. The Podemos Party has openly received Russian backing and support. The Spanish government believes that Russian hackers were also heavily involved in the Catalonia Independence Movement, which has had a destabilizing effect within Spain.

* In Finland, Russia launched a disinformation campaign prior to the 2015 election in an attempt to sway the electorate toward candidates and parties that favor Russian interests. Many foreign policy analysts have made comparisons between this campaign and the 2016 U.S. election in terms of Russian tactics and techniques.

* Montenegro, which has recently been in the news because President Trump suggested that helping them could possibly cause World War III, had their government servers hacked and witnessed Russia supporting separatist political parties that ended up launching a coup in 2016 in an attempt to prevent Montenegro from joining NATO, the organization President Trump has harshly criticized.

 We saw Russia’s ""Internet Research Agency"" putting out targeted ads to influence local pockets of voters around the country and witnessed Russians live hacking into U.S. political organizations and think tanks. We've seen Dutch intelligence tracking Russian hacking group Cozy Bear since 2014 and witnessed the penetrations of the DNC and DCCC live. Now we have new revelations of a female Russian agent infiltrating organizations like the National Rifle Association and interfering with political leaders and candidates to influence them toward a more Pro-Russian stance. We find that if our ""fake news"" is actually fake, then there is a massive conspiracy to lie to the populations of dozens of countries where Russia is simply a proverbial ""boogeyman."" The more logical answer is that, with multiple independent verifications from multiple governments, their various agencies, third-party cybersecurity contractors and even captured Russian hackers stating that they actually hacked us on Russian orders, they do it constantly and are quite excellent at it.

If it walks like, looks like and hacks like a Russian hacker, it must be a Russian hacker.",Vatican City,/r/europe/comments/ardlkg/merkel_backs_climate_protests_after_talk_of/egmxy7y/,marsianer,1550370344

Meme gold galore. As i said no democratic legitimacy whatsoever. And no referendum in greece because screw democracy and the will of the people , business is business.

Source pls? Polls on the matter range from 70% against the deal or more . Google is your friend.

1421,"Because of perceived grievances coming from Spain. Catalonia's relation with Spain has always been marred with repression and a desire to be more. This was much the case during Franco's regime, and had happened before in history several times as well. This wasn't so much an issue in the current democracy before 2010, since Catalonia was rather WELL off and rather content with its lot in Spanish politics, having almost complete autonomy and being a big player in both economic and politicial issues in our country.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the People's Party made it their mission to strike down the Estatut to appeal to the far-right citizens of Spain, where a certain hate for the catalans and the basque, and a reverence for Franco and its regime, has always remained. And that's exactly what they promoted, and continue to do. The catalan parties, of course, reacted just as you would expect - they struck back. Both appealed to their more hardcore voters and polarized the subject even further, and none dared to back down, lest they lose their voter base. Fast forward and the nationalist feelings on both sides are completely out of control, and so we have the mess we have now. Take in mind however, that whilst one side wants to be able to determine its own future through a vote (irregardless of any rational thinking), the other side just wants an excuse to shut down the autonomy and be proclaimed as a sort of national hero for defending the unity of Spain above everything else, remembering the ol' good days of Franco's regime. Not all Spaniards who oppose Catalonia's right for self-determination think so, but the most outspoken certainly do (\*cough\* VOX \*cough\*).

&amp;#x200B;

It's not like it was something that could've been avoided - things just run this way in our country, sadly. And there are grievances from the past that people were just forced to sort of ""forget"" (Pacto de la Transición), and it doesn't just affect the catalans.

1436,"&gt; It's insulting to those who wanted to remain.

On the contrary, I'd say it's actually supportive. Why would you think so?

&gt; And this gentleman wears a hoodie with the UK removed from Europe entirely. It's deliberately provacative and the message is clear, England is gone now. Yeah well, what about us remainers?

First things first, the stars on the European flag do not represent member states of the Council of Europe, the EU or any other Euroean instrument. They're merely a symbol of unity, solidarity and harmony, all of which have effectively being undermined by Brexit and England's own xenophobic and selfish attitude towards Europe and even the rest of the UK.

The UK* is indeed gone in a way, yet as much as the rest of the EU is not glad to see you leave and seeks to provide assurances for as harmonious a Brexit as possible for everyone, including The Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, it remains an issue of your own making and one that by nature democratically restricts the EU from meddling in your own affairs.

Westminster's childish approach to Brexit is devastating for everyone regardless of which side of the UK/EU border they might eventually land on after the 29th of March. You, as in the UK, have been rejecting your own deal time and again, more often than not expressing hateful comments towards the EU merely for communicating hard truths or daring to stand by one of its own member states and not prioritizing the UK's post-EU needs over its own.

The UK always had to be special. Sceptical about the EU as a whole, excluded from Schengen and the Eurozone, standing by the US over its closer allies, and yet nothing was ever enough. Perhaps this ends up helping England make up its mind over whether it wishes to remain eurosceptic or change its mentality. You can't always have your cake and eat it too.

&gt; What if I just randomly wore a yellow vest to a EU convention?

Brexit does not only negatively effect the UK and therefore even if the wearer's intention was to mock Britain over it, which once I again I believe it's non, it would still be pretty much acceptable to do so.

&gt; We can't trust our politicians and we don't have the support of other EU nations, so who do the remainers have now to voice their concerns? It's attack after attack on social media and by EU countries and their politicians. Our politicians have made a mockery of a country and now we are the laughing stock of Europe. This is our lives being threatened by brexit and our politicians. This isn't funny, it's extremely saddending, I have never hated politics as much as this.

As a citizen of Greece I should point out I know the feeling. It's irritating to know you've been made a laughing stock with little or no say over what comes next, even more so when there's no indication of things improving in any way. Even more so when rotten ideologies and awful priorities don't originate from the political structure alone.

I don't wish for my post to be interpreted as an attack to the british people, though I'm truly disappointed by the way your politicians and roughly half of your electorate has chosen to confront the rest of the union, similarly to how I have been a critic of our own govts' and citizens' mentalities regarding our own problems, their sources and how we should go about tackling them.

1470,"&gt;Guess I have a lot of questions. How is expenditure per person calculated? Does money spent on HS2 for example come under money spent on a person in Wales? 

I believe HS2 spending is now allocated to the regions in which it is being built.

&gt;Also, deficit assumes a knowledge of income from taxes, I know that kind of data doesn’t exist for Wales.

Some of it does. HMRC have a fairly good idea of regional income tax breakdowns. Things like VAT are apportioned to regions based on very large surveys of spending. The data is estimated but the accuracy is fairly good.

&gt;I’m guessing this assumes Wales and Scotland would spend 3% of GDP on military as well.

All non identifiable spending (defence, foreign affairs, debt interest etc) is apportioned on a per capita basis.

&gt;I’m not suggesting you’re being intentionally misleading, but I’m not convinced these figures make a good argument for Scotland not being able to afford independence. I’m assuming the budget being set is mostly by Westminster, as in the case of military for example. I’d even suggest this is good evidence for Scotland needing to take complete control of its own budget as Westminster’s spending is quite high.

In the SNP White Paper before the referendum they identified the following areas where they wanted to cut spending compared to the UK:

Defence  

Married couple's tax allowance  

Shares for rights scheme (tax allowance to encourage more flexible working)

Foreign affairs (a ""streamlined"" service for Scottish citizens and businesses overseas)

They estimated the total savings at £600 million a year (out of a budget of £63.7 billion). However, they also pledged to use the £500 million of the savings to fund higher pensions, benefits, more ""free"" services, foreign aid, reduce heating bills, increase tax allowances etc. So net savings of £100 million.",,/r/europe/comments/ar7ku3/potential_map_of_eu_if_brexit_leads_to_scottish/egmpgox/,WhiteSatanicMills,1550362802

1496,"I really hope it isn't, but the truth is that it's rather sketchy at best. Why?

(1) The accused have no chance of appealing the result, since its the highest court in Spanish law. Whatever the sentence, they can't appeal its result.

(2) The head judge who leads this trial, Manuel Marchena, has been revealed to be a key figure trusted by the Popular Party (the ex-ruling party), which they hoped would allow them to control the result of the trial ""behind the scenes"", as was leaked from a whatsapp group to the press. ([https://www.thenational.scot/news/17236299.leaked-catalan-whatsapp-row-sees-judge-pull-out-of-bid-for-top-spanish-job/)](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?stzid=Ugw-TPrCeG9nrRznf_B4AaABAg&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenational.scot%2Fnews%2F17236299.leaked-catalan-whatsapp-row-sees-judge-pull-out-of-bid-for-top-spanish-job%2F%29&amp;event=comments&amp;redir_token=e2id630xcEA3OnMkEUz5XWw-Iwh8MTU1MDQ0OTE1M0AxNTUwMzYyNzUz) 

(3) The accused are being judged in a court that would normally hold no competence in judging them - which should be the Supreme Justice Court of Catalonia, since that's were they were elected and it's what Spanish law says. But they made an exception for this case on the basis that it affected all Spaniards.

(4) The accused have no presumption of innocence: politicians of the current government are clearly saying  on TV that the accused are guilty. Some have even gone as far as to equate voting in an illegal referendum to rapng someone... and that's the left-wing ruling party. All right-wing parties are clamoring for their sentencing, with VOX being the popular prosecutor in this trial.

(5) They are accused of rebellion, which needs violence under Spanish law. But even if there has been very high tension and some fights (because there HAVE been), there's no proof anywhere that the accused instigated violence directly through any means. If anything, the Catalan 12 have always called for a calm and peaceful movement. What's more: all extradition orders for Puigdemont and the other fugitives have been withheld by Spain itself on the basis that if extradited from the countries they fled to, they'd had to drop the rebellion charges, since no other country's judiciary has found the evidence of violence presented by Spain to be convincing. 

(6) And lastly, they've been in pretrial detention for an incredibly long time before any date was even decided for this trial - some more than a year. The Jordis in particular weren't even jailed because of any escape risk or because they declared independence unilaterally, since they were imprisioned before the referendum even took place and none of those two are politicians.

The EPP has been the main driver\* of this series of decisions that will affect EU beyond their time in office, and which is turning France and other countries upside down. What was completely impossible, Le Pen winning -- no chance in hell because people would vote for a donkey on the 2nd turn rather than her -- is now a plausible event with a probability that I would no longer ignore. (Germany really doesn't want Le Pen either.)

Macron himself (whom I do not support) identifies the treaties as a root cause of this issue. He won't fix them though, because it's not too far from his personal political tint, so instead he decided to try and turn France upside down so it fits the signed papers.

That's what happens when ideology that is alien to the political cultures of several member states totalling a large part of the European population is forced onto them. They can't vote for someone else because someone else can't expand the policies they've been voted in for, which must not stray far from a set of ordoliberal-themed rules that unwisely made it into treaties. I can't say things will hold long enough for these populations to get ""used to it"", it's just as likely that they will flip the table in radical ways for radical outcomes. (Macron himself is already an embodiment of this, imagine what will happen if he fails to get people to ""get used to it"")

&amp;nbsp;

1627,"&gt; Sorry for owning some of it for several years.

In 1918, when we regained independence, Vilnus remained in Soviet Union. Majority polish city in Soviet Union with Lithuanians 2-3%, so what Lithuania has to do with it? Why are you apologizing Lithuanians? And what for?

We took the city only in 1919 during the polish-bolshevik war from Soviet Union, not from Lithuania. Then - in 1920 - during the Soviet counterattack, the Soviet Union regained the city. 

In 12 July 1920 Lithuania and Soviet Union signed a peace treaty (ratified by Lithuania only 6 August) under which Vilnus has been formally transfered to Lithuania. The treaty contained a secret clause enabling the Red Army to cross the Lithuanian territory on their march towards Poland. Moreover, during the fights in July and Soviet retreat in August, soviet troops were allowed to escape and shelter in Lithuania, while polish troops were not passed by Lithuanians, thus allowing Soviets to escape. 

Maybe it was like this because Vilnus area only formally has been ceded to Lithuania, while in reality it was occupied by the Red Army, without a break. Until their defeat, that is. In the end, Vilnus has belonged to Lithuania for only about 2 weeks, but only on paper. Anyway, in case of bolshevik victory, Lithuanian communists were ready to take over not only Vilnus and it's area, but the whole Lithuania, with the brotherly help with the red army.

Soviet Union lost war with Poland and they lost Vilnus to Poland. Lithuania gambled. They bet on the Soviet Union and they... well, didn't gain or lose anything from it, casue Vilnus wasn't their before the war, nor after the war. But in case of the bolshevik victory, they would lose all of Lithuania, so they kinda won in the end, despite their efforts to lose.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/ar7bfi/today_marks_the_101st_birthday_of_restored/egm7ds6/,Mandarke,1550347533

1643,"&gt;Let me remind you that this is exactly how the United States started out.

Not really.. I mean, you can draw vague parallels, but it's not 'how the US started out'. Moreover, the US went from a Confederation to a Federal structure fairly rapidly, and it did so with consent, the EU hasn't, and isn't close to having consent for anything approaching the United states.  

&gt;California was using pesos and voted against using a common US dollar, but they ended up being overruled. 

The difference is that most EU member states are unlikely to sign up to a Federal EU (which would be required for the EU to force any member to do anything outside of the narrow competencies the EU currently enjoys). 

&gt;Read up on the history of the United States, it has a lot of resemblances with the EU.

I'm well aware of the history of the US, and I agree that there are some parallels, but nothing to suggest that the EU is necessarily on the same path, and indeed that any route to a federal EU would be very, very different from the US one.

I'd argue that the EU is going to see another 30 years or so of gradual (although integrationist change), probably one or two more major treaty revisions, and at that point a decision will have to be made about whether the EU can be a federal, fairly centralised state or not, and whether the member state governments, and their populations will consent to it.

Bond are not means like investement, but principaly like security found.  

If you are a rich man in a country, with like for example, one milions of you national currency in bank, you are expected to invest hit.  But you are also interested in diversify a bit.  

You could, for example,invest 400,000 in some company, 300,000 buing some house and renting it and the rest 300,000 you could lend them to the governement for some low risk-low income interest rate.  

Now, image that the governement have a 8% interest rate but inflation is 10%. Now you have a return of -2%. So, why lend them to the governement?

Because the alternative is investing them in some other activities, that maybe return more money, but are also more risky  (and you have take already take enough risk) or let them in the bank to be destroied by a mostruos 10% inflation.  So lend them to the governemt is not that bad, It is almost certain that they return and besides having a real interest rate that is negative its still better then letting them devaluate in bank due to inflation.

Nowadays its true that no one would lend you money at this conditions, but only because they can go to other governement with better interest rate. That was impossible before euro.

1821,"I didn't say it made UI majority, I said it undermined support for the UK in a key demographic. I am suggesting that it will because if there is one reason I support something and then its gone, they why would I continue to support that thing. You are right, it is a fact that brexit undermines support for the UK, perhaps not fatally but a little is a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

I 100% acknowledge that a UI doesn't have majority support, but Brexit totally changes the landscape and undermines soft-nationalist support for the UK. If you know anything about NI you know this is true and you understand the reasons. If you don't ask on the NI or Ireland reddit and someone with more time than me will set you straight free of charge.

&amp;#x200B;

I do however find this interesting. Your #1 priority is support for the UK union in northern Ireland. This is a totally valid position to take and I respect it. However you must understand that my priority is stability in Northern Ireland and the border region of Ireland. While as an Irishman I hold a New Ireland as a long term aspiration, I am indifferent as to whether Northern Ireland is a part of Ireland or the UK as long as it is stable and safe, and I hope that you can respect that. The issue is that Brexit, whether or not you believe it undermines the UK union among small-n-nationalists or not, undermines the stability of Northern Ireland, if not the UK as a whole by introducing a tremendous amount of uncertainty. This last part is undeniable.

Almost all official documents and laws of the Grand Duchy were written in Belarusian rather than Lithuanian. In that sense, while it was called the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, it was as much a Belarusian state as it was a Lithuanian one.

So you can't really only look at the numbers in total (even though it's good that you have public sector jobs divided more or less evenly) but also locations of the ministers, their secretaries, the specialists, the researchers etc. who make direct or indirect policy, safety etc. decisions. These are usually, however, placed next to each other because they have to be in contact not only with the companies, but with ministries and parliament. 

When divisions away from central locations are made, they're still usually placed in places that don't usually ""need"" them that much.

I sensed this was going on, but don't follow things so closely. Can you provide actual examples of Trump doing this?

&gt;Trump saying Germany (and the EU) being ""evil"" and that people should remember who started WW2 to Macron.
 
Saying EU (and Germany specifically) are ""evil"" is really abusive and wrong. When did this happen?

&gt;Constant threats towards german companies

What were the circumstances, actually? Was this regarding Iran? Trump wants German companies doing business with Iran to stop?

&gt;Open support for Brexit and other movements to break up the EU

I suppose you could say Brexit was passed by the Brits themselves. But what other movements are there to break up or weaken the EU, how significant are these threats, and how would Trump play a leading role? I like the EU, btw, and don't really understand why the Brits wanted out or why that would be good for all parties.

&gt;An attitude of american politians (and a lot of american people, as shown in this thread) to see european countries not as partners anymore, but vassals to do their bidding.

Yeh this is bad. But americans online, I mean, that's tragic yes... but one could say this has little meaning in reality. The realm of online forums is a virtual thing, and not so real as reality. With the rise of sock puppets, one cannot know who is even a real human entity, authentically representing themselves only, and who is a plant. Who are you, in reality, for example?

That's sad, because the desire is definitely real. It is a matter of fact that the concept of ""[United Macedonia](https://reddit.com)"" is not only a view propagated among the nationalist circles, it's part of the fucking school curriculum! At least, this is what a sane person would have inferred, had he watched their Prime minister Zoran Zaev vote in the last year's referendum with his son, with a ""United Macedonia"" map in the background, wouldn't he?

That's among the reasons the Lake Prespa Accord is composed by many, many articles. It's has always been more than just a plain name dispute.

Greece on the other hand claimed that the region of Macedonia has always been the region that lies within Greece and that the people living in Macedonia had always been Greek. There where fears that FYROM’s historic revisionism would cause instability in the Balkans and that it would be used by foreign powers (Turkey in particular) to destabilise Greece itself.

&gt;  
&gt;Then it is either ""too expensive"" or just ""can't do it it would mean I have to plan on more time commuting"". We already do life over your expensive climate wise. If we don't back up nothing can change.

And so can we absolve our governments from doing nothing? The Dutch government faced protests from students after failing to sign the Climate Accord, because it is very true that the Netherlands (of all fucking places) really should pay attention to such problematic challenges like change.

People indeed will always choose convenience of whatever is available, but similarly, I believe it is the role of the government to seek fully informed views to make a decision on what should and should not be done.  The Dutch government, for example, easily could start phasing out coal and gas, and yet we're still stuck with non-renewable energies and no significant investments made towards that transition.

&gt;If it is as important to pupils there would be no problem to form a climate club that does it, research and educate after school.

Again, these already exist, and in fact some even work with schools themselves, and climate change has widely already been included in schools curriculae for years now.

The problem is not about informing them, the problem is informing politicians, who are all far happier ignoring pragmatic solutions to favor frivolous power grab pursuits instead.

&gt;There are some protests but not as big and constant (at least in Germany)

And I can only hope they grow.

Until our governments come with an appropriate answer to climate change, then these protests should happen, in a peaceful manner (take note Yellow Vests) but still pressuring the government for the change we need.",LusoFrench citizen living in the Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/ar2i5p/theresa_may_criticises_pupils_missing_school_to/egl9ioh/,RafaRealness,1550311345

Whole of mainland Greece including territories north of current Greek border were overrun by Slavs in VII century and both populations mixed indistinguishably pretty quickly as it was the case everywhere with the Slavic expansion. 

Only reason why today's Greeks speak Greek and today's (Northern) Macedonians don't is the extend of later Byzantine resurgence. 

Where it reached local Helleno-Slavic population got Hellenized, where it didn't the same mix of local Hellenes and newly arrived Slavs (and later Bulgars) become Slavicized.

2138,"Yes.

&gt;For the last quarter century, the checks and balances of American government have been increasingly battered by the merger of two powerful currents. One is the gathering concentration of power in the hands of the federal executive, a trend nurtured since the New Deal by Presidents both Democratic and Republican, although at different rates of acceleration. The second current has been the relentless campaign of the right wing of the Republican Party since 1981 to steer the capacities of our national government toward the fulfillment of a conservative social, economic, and foreign policy agenda. Together, the growing concentration of executive power and the campaign for partisan predominance have produced an era of aggressive presidentialism, a theory of government and a pattern of government practice that treat our Constitution as vesting in the President a fixed and expansive category of executive authority largely immune to legislative control or judicial review. This constitutional perfect storm has put the design of our democratic republic at risk, upending many of the norms and informal institutional practices that have helped to sustain the Madisonian checks and balances in our national government, at least since the end of World War II.

(...)

&gt;The Clinton-era developments illustrate one of the great dangers of presidentialism—its resistance to contraction. The usurpation of authority works as a one-way ratchet. Even if only some Presidents advance executive power unduly as a matter of partisan ideology, all Presidents, whenever their power is challenged, will be tempted to embrace their predecessors’ more audacious claims as sources of legal authority and strike out on their own. Unless somehow rebuked, the example of any President asserting authority without a genuine constitutional basis thus becomes historical precedent for the next President committed to the practice of presidentialism whether as a matter of ideological commitment or mere political calculation.

(...)

&gt;At the heart at our founders’ design for a new republican form of government is a web of political institutions structured to hold each other accountable. As Madison explained, it is not enough for the security of liberty that the constitutional text provide for three separate and distinct branches of the national government. It is not sufficient that legislative, executive, and judicial powers should each, in the main, be concentrated chiefly in just one of those branches. Power, he wrote, “is of an encroaching nature” and must “be effectually restrained from passing the limits assigned to it.” The separation of powers, in other words, is essential to liberty, but cannot preserve itself without checks and balances.

(...)

&gt;The attack on checks and balances between 1981 and 2009 can very much be seen as an assault on a constitutional culture built on checks and balances norms. Each branch has been deploying its powers with increasing disrespect for its coequal branches, and the escalating institutional conflict between President and Congress most especially has created a level of mutual disregard that would have been essentially unthinkable at any prior moment in modern times. 

&gt;But there is an even larger point to be made here. As serious as may be abuses of power by both Congress and the Supreme Court, it is the President who, at the start of the twenty-first century, poses the most profound threat to our checks and balances system. First, as Iran-Contra demonstrates, it is the President who has the greatest capacity to act in secret and without the assistance of the other two branches. Had details of the Iranian arms deal not leaked through a foreign journalist, we may never have learned of the Reagan Administration’s assault on Congress’s appropriations and foreign affairs powers. In contrast, the impeachment of Bill Clinton and Bush v. Gore were ignominious, but public events. Thus, to the extent that transparency fosters accountability, it is the executive branch with its ability to operate secretly that is the most worrisome.

At first, it was the embargo from our side which IMO was uncalled for and raised tensions in a period when should have approached their state with amicable feelings instead of hostility.

On the other side, when they, North Macedonia, declared their independence, they started using the ancient Vergina Sun symbol as their flag which was a clear indication that some higher ups there wanted to push for the ""we are ancient macedonians"" agenda, something that happened during the Gruevski administration in which he aggressively  filled his country with fake classical Greek facades on buildings and puttting iron and styrofoam statues of the long lost Ancient Macedons in display in everywhere, while also indoctrinating the young people into irredentist claims that ""Bulgaria and Greece stole their lands"".

Researches have shown that modern Greek do carry the same genes as their ancestors, despite the fact Slavs and other populations were later added to the admixture and which in my opinion is a good thing in order to keep the DNA as healthy as possible. 

The fact is not a genetical over the issue with the name, it's a geograpical and historical one.

I think the more important point is that the UK *is* getting deals done. 

The remain camp was claiming that these trade deals were too complex to finish before Brexit had been finalized. They that these deals would take many years to negotiate, and in the meantime the UK would be empty handed. That because the EU has been negotiating trade on the UK's behalf that meant that the UK lacked the expertise to negotiate big trade deals. And of course there was Obama's comment about the UK going to the ""back of the line"".

2431,"&gt; Amazon made an $11.2bn profit in 2018 but paid **no federal tax**

&gt; Company is **not paying any taxes** for the second year in a row

&gt; Those critics were given more ammunition this week when the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) published a report showing Amazon is **not paying a single cent in taxes** for the second year in a row.

&gt; But far from **paying the statutory 21% income tax rate**, it reported a $129m federal income tax rebate for the year – a tax rate of -1%.

I can excuse clickbait in the headline, but you cannot say that someone paid ""no tax"" if they paid 21% income tax at the state level.  I understand that journalism has had quite the decline since online advertising revenue died off and that taxes increase the odds of bad journalism even further, but [just looking at the Amazon financial statements showed they paid just shy of $1.2 BB in income tax](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/amzn/financials?query=income-statement).

2446,"&gt;We've been over this, and you haven't answered. 

I have answered if you read any of my posts; Macedonia and the people of Macedonia still exist in Greece to this day. The Slavs in the former Yugoslav republic fabricating their heritage and missing the mark by about 900 years, are not Macedonians. That part of their territory was once in a province that the Romans happened to call Macedonia before these Slavs even arrived at the location

The Roman province is simply not relevant in this discussion, because Macedonia is a Hellenic people and a geographical region that existed prior to the Roman province, continued to exist after the Roman province was disbanded, and certainly existed before any Slavs even lived on the Balkan peninsula.

I'll restate it since you're apparently having issues with it: An entire people and area are already called Macedonia. It hasn't been the name of a Roman province for 600 years, and it's easily not a slavic nation.

And all of this is being said without adressing the terminal issue on your side of the argument. I'll say it again, maybe you won't ignore it: The origin of the entire farce comes from a 20th century communist scheme to create a ""United Macedonia"" which amazingly would involve renaming Thessaloniki, a millenia old Hellenic city, to ""Solun"". To this day former Yugoslav irredentists are pretending to be the 'true ethnic macedonians' despite the fact that Slavs arrived in the Balkans a millenia after the first recorded details of the Hellenic kingdom of Macedonia, even going so far as to trying to co-opt the symbol of that ancient kingdom to unsuccessfully scrounge some credibily.

2463,"&gt; I have answered if you read any of my posts; Macedonia and the people of Macedonia still exist in Greece to this day.

And the people of Rome existed at the same time as the Byzantine Empire. The name ""Roman"" was concurrently named for both, regardless of the origin.

&gt; The Slavs in the former Yugoslav republic who have been fabricating their heritage and missing the mark by about 900 years, are not Macedonians. That a part of their territory was once in a province that the Romans happened to call **Macedonia** before these Slavs even arrived at the location is simply not relevant in this discussion

Dude, that makes them Macedonians. It doesn't matter that Spanish colonists aren't Mexica people; they're still Mexicans, because they live in Mexico. Nor does it matter that the word ""Canada"" has a native origin that has little to do with Canadians, they're still Canadians.

Living in an area called ""Macedonia"" makes you Macedonian. That's how humanity names things.

&gt; An entire people and area are already called Macedonia.

I'll repeat this back at you: a name can mean different things. Macedonia can mean both the region of Hellenes derived from Macedon *and* the Slavic country derived from the added bits to the north for the province.

The people don't even have to be related. The name ""Macedonia"" carries two distinct meanings.

&gt; And all of this is being said without adressing the terminal issue on your side of the argument. I'll say it again, maybe you won't ignore it: The origin of the entire farce comes from a 20th century communist scheme to create a ""United Macedonia"" which amazingly would involve renaming Thessaloniki, a millenia old Hellenic city, to ""Solun"". To this day former Yugoslav irredentists are pretending to be the 'true ethnic macedonians', and that the actual Macedonians are ""Agean Macedonians"" - despite the fact that Slavs arrived in the Balkans a millenia after the first recorded details of the Hellenic kingdom of Macedonia, even going so far as to trying to co-opt the symbol of that ancient kingdom to unsuccessfully scrounge some credibily.

And those people are fucking idiots.

&gt; And all you have to counter all of this embarrassing, shameless, and obviously fraudulent nonsense is that at one point the Romans used the name for a province that included a bunch of other land that also isn't Macedonia. It is, to say the least, unconvincing.

I guess I'm confused. How do you think names are formed? Do you think Adam himself came to Greece and named the region Macedonia? You call the region Macedonia because you were taught that that's what that piece of land was called. For hundreds of years, the Slavs in North Macedonia were taught the same thing, because centuries before their time, the government that ruled all of the Balkans called it that. 

I'm going to go back to this, because this is relevant. For a long time, the word ""Roman"" meant different things. At one point, ""Roman"" could've meant the German empire to the north, the Greek-speaking empire to the east, or an Italian living in the cityof Rome.

2586,"&gt;To your first point, member states will have to implement the directive in local law and have the opportunity to require filters. It's not some separate law they might dream up but a direct consequence of the directive.

Yeah, but the difference is when the problem is. If a country does try to pass a stupid stupid law, that's the time to protest. Wanting the directive stopped because a country might do something stupid in the future because of it is like leaving the EU, not because you disagree with the EU now, but you might in the future.

&gt;To your second point, I think you downplay the possible consequences of a threat of a lawsuit. With this directive we are turning back digital copyright 20 years by removing safe habor. The threat of lawsuits will be a major barrier to entry to new platforms and business models and will hurt SMEs and independent artists.

No, it *benefits* independent artists. They're the ones who lose out because of the existing safe harbor laws. Those laws let websites use their works without permission. In fact, you could say the main point of Article 13 is to scale back the safe harbor laws.

In any case, I don't think it will be a big problem. There'll certainly be more opportunity for lawsuits, but lawsuits exist in basically every industry, and I haven't heard anyone suggesting we should scrap laws for any of those because they're a major barrier to entry for new businesses. I also haven't heard anything suggesting that there'll be much more lawsuits for this case than in other industries either.","From Ireland, in Bulgaria",/r/europe/comments/aqw0mv/eu_commission_portrays_article_13_opponents_as_a/egkpj0h/,LtLabcoat,1550285135

2602,"I think the real problem is the idea that we have to do just about everything as a group in the first place. If the other European countries want to take a strong stance on the whole Venezuela thing they can just do that, they don't need Italy to agree with it. Nothing prevents Germany, France, Denmark, UK, Spain, Poland etc. from making a statement together, it doesn't *have* to be an ""EU statement"" every time someone wants to take a stand on anything.

Getting rid of unanimity allows members countries to ""punish"" others who don't agree with the political line, that's hardly why anyone joined the EU. If Germany stands alone on some issue, that doesn't mean Germany is automatically wrong. Some things can be in Germany's best interest while not being in the best interest of Spain or whatever. Then Spain should obviously be against it, and Germany should obviously be for it. Neither side should be ""punished"" for doing what's in their country's interest, that's what the politicians are elected to do.

It's all well and good pointing to the special cases where Poland's government goes crazy, where you have a populist anti-EU government in Italy etc. but it also goes for all the normal day to day disagreements between other member nations, they happen daily. Without unanimity other nations can end up basically running your country for you.

The simple truth is that all the different nations and nationalities in Europe don't agree on everything, they don't want the same things, their goals and values aren't the same etc. but EU doesn't seem to get that, it's like they just assume everyone wants the same thing which isn't close to being the case at all. There is no big ""Eurodentity"" no matter how nice it sounds, and Germans don't want the Italians running their country, Spain doesn't want Poland running theirs etc. Germans don't give two shits about how Italians think their country should be run, and why would they? It's not their country, it's none of their business how it's run.

I think the only reasonable way for the EU to function in the future is to stop pretending that we're all the same and all agree on things. If Guy wants to speak out against Venezuela he can do that without it requiring an EU-wide statement. If Italy (for whatever weird reason..) don't agree with his view on Venezuela, they obviously shouldn't be forced to join his ""side"" just out of some EU-solidarity principle. 

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not fan of Italian politicians but I'm even less of a fan of letting other EU countries run things for us whenever they disagree with national government. Italians and their politicians should run Italy, Danes and their politicians should run Denmark etc. I don't give two shits about how other nationalities think our country should be run, it's none of their business.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/aqvsyt/guy_verhofstadt_talk_about_italy/egkef4o/,Dnarg,1550275242

2616,"A senior Belgian counter-intelligence officer is under house arrest after allegations that he spied for Russia in a case that could highlight the security threat to Nato and European Union headquarters in Brussels.

The major, head of a division in Belgium’s external security department of the General Intelligence and Security Service (Giss), the equivalent of MI6, is suspected of passing secrets to Russia via a Serbian agent.

In a further blow, Clement Vandenborre, the head of counterintelligence in Giss, has been removed from office pending an investigation into allegations he illegally destroyed documents.

The turmoil at the top of Belgium’s counter-intelligence services raises concerns that the security of key international institutions, including the Western military alliance, have been compromised.

The unnamed major is suspected of being a Russian agent and is under investigation by Belgian federal prosecutors and by the Committee I, a parliamentary oversight body.

He was accused of espionage after a letter from another Belgian counter-intelligence officer that denounced him.

According to De Morgen newspaper, allegations centre on a special 2016 operation in Serbia when, it is alleged, the major passed classified information to a Serbian woman who is believed to be an agent for Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency.

EUobserver, an influential Brussels website, reported fears that the security breach could be as serious as the case of Herman Simm. Simm, who worked for the Estonian defence ministry, was convicted of Russian espionage in Tallinn in 2009.

Simm leaked 386 EU and Nato-linked files, some of which were classified as “confidential” and “secret”.

Meanwhile, Mr Vandenborre, the head of Belgian counter-intelligence, has been told not to report to work after being accused of illegally shredding sensitive documents and mismanagement.

It has been revealed that in the autumn of 2016 high-ranking intelligence officers from twice travelled to the Syrian capital Damascus to negotiate with the regime of President Assad, talks that took place, it is alleged, without political clearance.

According to Germany’s Welt am Sonntag newspaper, EU officials and Europe diplomats, (about 50,000 personnel), have been warned about the threat of “about 250 Chinese and 200 Russian spies” operating in Brussels.

The European External Action Service (EEAS), the EU’s diplomatic corps, including a shared intelligence unit INTCEN, advised diplomats and military officials to avoid certain cafés and restaurants.

Staff were warned that Russian or Chinese listening devices could be used to pick up their conversations from other tables or through windows.

Last summer, the head of Austria’s domestic intelligence agency, Peter Gridling, said that “Brussels has now overtaken Vienna . . . and there is now a greater density of so-called intelligence services from outside the EU”.

Officials working on sensitive information on high floors of EU institutions, including the British embassy, routinely close special security blinds on windows to guard against listening devices carried on drones.

Last August, Sabine Weyand, the EU’s deputy Brexit negotiator, joked that UK intelligence might be listening into internal meetings because of the speed by which British diplomats knew of developments.

The joke disguised a serious warning that the Brussels “corridor” culture of political gossip and the networks of diplomats trading information with each other could breach security.

Earlier this week, Olly Robbins, the UK’s lead negotiator, was overheard by an ITV journalist discussing the government’s Brexit strategic in the bar of the hotel in Brussels where he was staying.

Posters in the British embassy in Brussels show the silhouette of a sinister figure wearing a trilby to warn staff against eavesdroppers or electronic surveillance.

The chlorination itself is not a significant health risk and post-chlorination pathogen levels are similar to pathogen levels in unchlorinated European chicken.

The problem with it and the reason why it's banned in Europe is the necessity of chlorination to make it safe. 

Chickens should be raised in conditions that make them safe to eat even without chlorination. 

Letting chicken wallow in their own shit and then chlorinating them afterwards is the cheaper method, though.

It's obviously an even bigger issue in a country like England where education is quite expensive. The parents' wealth shouldn't determine who gets an education in a functioning society.

&gt;Here’s an uncomfortable thought for the European Central Bank as it attempts to lift interest rates off the lower bound: the euro area looks a lot like Japan, where rates went to zero 20 years ago and never left, according to analysis by Bloomberg Economics. Though the ECB eventually delivered a huge monetary stimulus, a period of deep austerity delayed the recovery from the sovereign debt crisis in 2010 and left the economy running under capacity. Even as the crisis recedes into the rear-view mirror, limited productivity gains, a shrinking working age population, and modest space to catch up to the technology frontier compound the problems.

&gt;— With assistance by Eliza Winger

Yeah, I've been pointing it out for a while now… here's some background for those who are interested:

&gt;This article examines the causes and consequences of the dramatic growth of precarious employment in Japan since the 1990s. In response to heightened competition associated with globalization, Japanese firms adopted cost-cutting policies to remain competitive, especially in terms of reducing wage outlays. As a result, companies hired fewer regular workers and increased the proportion of temporary workers. Based upon the breadwinner model, Japan mandated social insurance benefits only for regular workers, creating a significant incentive to hire more temporary workers. The lack of economic security among a significant portion of the labor force has repercussions for many young people, who are now marginalized as nonregular workers and are delaying or avoiding marriage and family formation. This trend is exacerbating the low fertility rate and also means that government social policies relying on a supportive family are at odds with emerging social realities. With low wages and limited social support, the working poor are becoming entrenched in poverty. Furthermore, a gender bias in social spending and taxation is pronounced in Japan, and that adversely affects women workers, especially single mothers.

2896,"Well, let's see where this discussions takes us... So the HRE is destroyed, the old structures are swept away and a few bigger German states are left behind. Germans as a whole start to think they've had enough from foreign invasions and decide to work on unite Germany as a single state.

The resulting tensions from the unification of Germany lead to two world wars, the downfall of the European economies and the dissolution of colonial empires, reshaping the world.

I'm guessing that's basically what you're saying. My perspective is that: the German unification didn't matter. Europe already had plenty of hyper-aggressive, hyper-competitive colonial empires that an all out war (or several) with modern, industrial technology was inevitable.

The peace after the Congress of Vienna was an exception in European politics, not the standard. It was unlikely to last anyway. The European empires would have fallen, sooner or later.

So I'm sticking to my point: those events didn't matter.

Heck, on the global scale Italy's reunification mattered even less. Of course, regionally, it did matter, I'd imagine Ethiopians would have some choice words about the reunited Italy...",Romania,/r/europe/comments/aqxc87/france_military_history_vs_major_powers_5232013/egjx0xl/,oblio-,1550261753

America is the wealthiest nation on Earth, but its people are mainly poor, and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves. To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, 'It ain’t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.' It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'if you’re so smart, why ain’t you rich?' There will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand – glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register.

Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor.

All this works only in the framework of this system. This is the root of the fucking issue here. People betting on the infinitely growing system so it can grow even more. It's absurd. Profit is the only value this system understands, and people justify its existence with the profit they make...

3069,"Your straight up wrong about a lot of things here. 

The first group of people in Sweden who walked here was the Motala people for 8,000-7,000 years ago, who already had mutations in the protein SLC45A2 and SLC24A5, which produces white skin pigment. Previous finds are more difficult to find because Scandinavia was either a couple of islands from the melted ice or part of the large ice sheet. 

And not to mention also that the majority of West / Central European tribes from 10,000 years BC and later had barely darker skins than modern southern Europeans / Levante people due to the adaptation of the colder climate and intersection with the native Neanderthal population.

So in any case, giving an African actress the role of a Stone Age European gives a historically unreal picture.

Now onto who should represent the people who first came to Sweden : 

The best representation from scientific evidence for the Western Hunter Gatherers who first came to Sweden would be a blue eyed Spanish person.

There are numerous examples you can find of this online if you spend two minutes researching instead of arguing with me.

In a very obvious and direct example the Nazis after the invasion of Jedwabne, distributed antisemitic propaganda to locals and Nazi officials were instructed to sow discord in the local population against them. The Gestapo had a direct role in agitating for a pogrom to happen and the result was that ethnic Poles ended up carrying it out. Over 300 jews died.

This leads to the problem that you can't really draw any causal conclusions from just that data, but people are doing so for political reasons.

There would have been a lot of interbreeding and adapting to the climate before they came sweden. Look at it from the other way, with such a dark skin they would already risk vitamin D deficiency because of the increased melanin in their skin if they'd live in the other regions in europe. But you suggets that sapiens with such a dark skin would still migrate as far as sweden???

This has created classes and trust issues that exist to today. 

Brazil for example flirted with communism in 1960s, where rigid economic policies strapped down the nation and prevented growth. Brazil has a huge population and more natural resources and should be richer than the US.

3256,"Nobody is making you consume. Looking at global poverty it seems capitalism is pretty good at removing it. I think your stance on consumerist culture is typical and vague. You are here using reddit because its fun, you can use a pc or phone to access it because enterprise has via  competition brought the price of electronics down and made them easily usable for me and you. I stand against any central authority that wants to tell what's best for me and what I should or should not consume as I believe in an individuals right to self determination.

A company markets their products to increase awarness, marketing is not a valid criticism against the effectiveness of the market. Quite simply it has nothing to do with the effectiveness of the market and the link you make isn't as obvious to me as it is to you.

Equating marketing to propaganda is a false equivalence, which is a fallacy. Its quite an obvious one as well. Just because they both share the a characteristic, namely transmitting a message, doesn't mean they are both thr same thing. Textbook false equivalence.

Sometiming being a useless product is your opinion, don't mistake it for some kind of fact. The argument that we don't need x or y to survive is incredibly dull. In fact we only need very little to survive. You don't need ti paint to survive, you don't need to create to survive, you don't need a system that allows for leisure to survivr, you don't need to study the universe to survive. Who the fuck are you to judge on what should be deemed necessary for our species continuation. What you are advocating is the enforcement of your opinion on others, in that you are nothing more than an authoritarian.

I find most of your rant to be of the ""self evudent"" nature. Or at least you hold it to be self evident. I see that the world is more accepting to different cultures than any other time before, we create more than any other time before, and we do more research than any time before. If anything culture and art have exploded. We have everything from very shallow pop culture to underground movements that could never be before. Really it is you who has convinced yourself that somehow we are worst off, culture wise.

There are more people going to university than any other time before, no one is making you specialise. It's just we need people to do a job and we offer them compensation for their work, since resources are inherently finite we can't just abolish jobs. You can choose to go to school for whatever reason you want to, it is what you make of it. I fail to see how the world must pander to your view of schooling. Nobody is stopping you from learning for the sake of learning. You just want your opinion to be enforced on everyone. Which is why you are so much against free enterprise. It bothers you that people are doing stuff for reasons you deem unworthy. That makes you an elitist.

You also don't seem to understand the fluidity of culture and traditions. You would rather us stick to old ways because why exactly? You have not given any reason or justification for why current culture is bad. Do I, as a Bulgarian, have to renounce jeans as an American infringement of my culture. Lol. Such shallow views of what makes an identity or culture itself.

There is no state of nature, this is an appeal to nature, yet another fallacy, you seem to make many btw. There is no natural rule of law, there is no objective morality, there is no natural state of affairs. Do you want some kind of technological regression and the destruction of society?

Look it can't sustain itself!

My point was that if capitalism keeps going on like it is it will collapse. The question is whether that will lead to barbarism or, if we can transform into socialism to avoid that.

&gt; Socialism or Barbarism is a concept frequently used in Marxist thought and literature. Attributed to Friedrich Engels, it became widely known through Rosa Luxemburg's ""Junius Pamphlet"" of 1916, where she wrote ""Bourgeois society stands at the crossroads, either transition to Socialism or regression into Barbarism.""

Its been able to reinvent itself, with ever more precarious card houses and finding new a regions to exploit, but this won't go on for ever. The pressures on the working class are only increasing, this will at some point boil over.

3327,"Official German post-reunification policy towards Russia has always been to create as tight economic bonds with Russia as possible. This would serve to make it economical suicide for any one side to attack the other again. At the same time, not entirely embracing Russia politically while not holding it further away than arms length either ensured there would always be open channels for communication and possible peaceful solutions to every problem. Germany has taken on a role as a credible negotiator between EU or NATO and Russia more than once with both sides agreeing on the german diplomats having represented their interests fairly and to their satisfaction thus that larger conflict could be prevented and / or existing conflict could be resolved or at least reduced.

The influence german chancellors hold in Moscow is an influence that certainly does not rely on military strength but economic partnership and diplomatic understanding. We may not agree with or even like the russian government, but working together instead of against each other has in the past prevented harsher forms of conflict on more than one occasion.

This is why, for example, Nord Stream 2 is not only seen as an economic but also as a peace-ensuring project for many in the ruling CDU/CSU and Merkel herself. Not only does it strengthen economic ties, thus creating an incentive for peaceful negotiations should the need arise, but russian gas producers are far more reliant on the german market and investment than the german economy is on russian natural gas, leaving the greater leverage this creates in the hands of a member of the EU. (At least in the eyes of CDU/CSU)

The annexation of Crimea and Germanys role in the placement of the 2014 sanctions following the russian invasion have strained this relationship and Germanys new found (or likely thrust upon by circumstance) role of leadership inside the EU will most likely put further strains on the relations as Germany will find it increasingly harder to hold a neutral and diplomatic position while at the same time being pushed to perform in a leadership role for one side.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/world/europe/poland-death-camp-law.html
""More troubling, historians say, is the second part of the law, which makes it a crime — punishable by a fine or up to three years in prison — to accuse “the Polish nation” of complicity in the Holocaust and other Nazi atrocities. They say that the nationalist government is trying to whitewash the role of Poles in one of history’s bloodiest chapters.""

""Historians continue to debate the degree of Polish responsibility for the Holocaust. Though the camps were a Nazi enterprise, anti-Semitism was rife in Poland before the war, some of it government- ­sponsored. Though many Poles fought the Nazi occupation and tried to save Jews, some also helped round them up, stole their property and participated in massacres. In addition to outlawing the term ""death camps,"" the legislation criminalizes any suggestion that ""the Polish nation"" or ""Polish state"" was ""responsible or complicit"" in Nazi crimes. As the Israeli Holocaust remembrance center Yad Vashem pointed out, that could have the effect of obscuring ""historical truths regarding the assistance the Germans received from the Polish population.""""

3384,"&gt; Just being older than 3 years is enough to qualify as not being a start up anymore and needing to filter content.

This is false.

Below from [Article 13 (4aa)](https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mandate-Romania-February-8.pdf).

&gt; 4aa. Member States shall provide that when new online content sharing service providers whose services have been available to the public in the Union for less than three years and which have an annual turnover below EUR 10 million within the meaning of the Commission recommendation 2003/361/EC, the conditions applicable to them under the liability regime set out in paragraph 4 are limited to the compliance with the point (a)of paragraph 4 and to acting expeditiously, upon receiving a sufficiently substantiated notice, to remove the notified works and subject matters from its website or to disable access to them.

&gt; And what'd likely end up happening is

an assumption on your part. People have had similar worst case scenarios about GDPR when saying that sites would rather block EU users instead of complying and that wasn't the case. Most sites are already GDPR compliant.

&gt; There isn't an ""Ignorance is an excuse"" clause anywhere in the law that implies that if the site doesn't know its copyrighted they are free from punishment.

You're missing the point. The point is that filters are not supposed to decide by themselves what is copyrighted material. Copyright holders have to provide materials to identify copyrighted materials. Sites have no obligation to hunt down rightholders for every image users post.

&gt; Also all this does is punish small times rights holders since they don't have the people to contact sites to protect their copyrights while the large companies can have a team scanning every site.

The point of the law is to allow rightholders of all sizes the tools required to protect their works. Filters cannot guess if images are copyrighted or not unless rightholders provide adequate information. Until now small rightholders had no such tools. Their only option was to issue take-down requests for every re-upload and that's impossible to do even for big companies.

Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeell, while we do not consider ourselves as ""greatest"" we kinda have this cultivated myth of unique(just like US have) due to how many shit we gone through.

&gt;I think the US's massive hypocrisy is a big factor in why some Germans trust Russia more than they do the US.

Hypocrisy  is a big factor in why a lot of russians okay with shit that Putin does in foreign policy. A lot of russians consider US to be let scots-free for their shit and such consider that others are biased against us or that everyone okay with shit as long as their benefit them so there no reason to upheld to the rules if there someone who can break them whenever he wants and will be left unpunished.

&gt;I think another major factor was the revelation that US is spying on and meddling with its allies so much. Sure, Russia does that as well, but it is Russia. Such things are expected from Russia.

This is prime prejudice russophobic example, since 1991 till 2007 Russia behavior was most neutral, but treatment of it as enemy and hostile foreign politics toward it haven't ceased, which allowed Putin to do such 180 in relations between Russia and the World.

These are two different problems. Why would I believe that? I am mostly concerned with the idea that a lot of people believe others are better than them just because of whom they were born to.

This is in my opinion a problem as it gives these individuals undue power and diminishes the self-worth of these individuals.

Inequality is of course the much bigger problem than this and should be resolved as well. But rich people are not the topic of this thread.

I'm just gonna address the situation I'm more familiar with as a local resident and historian: the CIA is way more involved into drugs that we know, when the route of cocaine through the pacific was shut down it shifted towards the Mexican hinterlands. 

The city I lived in is the one that closed the deal, and the transport of Guadalajara's Cartel (the first national one) was sponsored by the CIA, it's naive to think that the amount of drugs that cross the border daily go without massive corruption in both ends. Since then there has been a slow civil war, later the terrorist cartels of today were founded by US-educated military men, such as the leaders who took part in the Condor Operation. The image is pretty dark now, and we might be death when we have reliable sources (if we get any), as even mild journalistic job about the topic leads to murdered journalist, so it's a topic that can't be studied without risk as for now. 

With those considerations, many of the acts US has committed in LA have been truly acts of war and straight up terrorism. Not everything and everyone is bad of course, but in a sovereignty level LA's leaders have to wake up and see US as the threat it is and join efforts do dismantle the US in its current form because we won't have real development and sovereignty with the current state of things.

3528,"&gt;Roman times.

No, *modern times*. Look at what FYROM - a nation of Slavs that arrived 900 years after Philip ruled in Macedonia - is claiming to be [""historical ethnic Macedonia""](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Ethnicmacedonia.jpg).

Now look at the [Roman province](http://enacademic.com/pictures/enwiki/76/LocationMacedonia-ROMAN-z.png). That province looks nothing like any definition of Macedonia that anyone's using, least of all the FYROM irredentist one (which is the entire basis for their purported nationality). Why? Because the *Roman administrative province* is named after the geographical region of Macedonia, and not the other way around.

If we use your logic taht the shape of the Roman province has any bearing on the definition of Macedonia, then southern Albania would be ""West Macedonia"" and all of Thessaly would be ""South Macedonia"". Paionia would also be renamed, but the former Yugoslavs have already pulled that sleight of hand. And finally, since we're basing our regions on Roman provinces, contemporary FYROM would lose half of its territory to some country named [""Moesia""](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Roman_Empire_Map.png). 

And this isn't even mentioning - which I'll do *again* - that this province is from *six centuries* before the Slavic people of FYROM had even arrived from beyond the Danube.

Basically nothing adds up with this story, so I'd put that gambit to rest.

&gt;Jesus Christ, nothing would please you.

Untrue. 90% of the Macedonian region is contained within Greek Macedonia. 90% of FYROM is located in areas that *had other names*. They could just name the southernmost province of the country Macedonia *and be correct*, and use a name for their country that isn't taken - like Paionia or Moesia.

Second, videos unfortunately often don't get to the point very quickly — they have ""openers"" to watch, and preliminary comments and so forth before they get around to describing what they're going to say, which means that determining whether-or-not a video is relevant requires minutes, rather than the seconds of skimming relevant titles or the first paragraph of news stories.

Third, it may or may not be even possible to determine relevance without having audio enabled, and many users are in situations where it maybe problematic to be playing audio.

There aren't a *ton* of videos that show up here, but the ones that do tend not to see many votes or discussion, and I feel like people are skipping over them.  I don't want to ban videos, because there are extremely relevant and important things that might show up.  I dunno, coverage of a terrorist incident or something.

Bipartisan issues are among others: he has defended ministers that made major errors, he wanted to cut a tax for big corporations that noone believed worked, he was closely involved with Unilever who would benefit. The story was that it would help the settling climate of corporations, even though they said it is no themselves, and he laughs away every negative comment about him. People don’t believe him anymore. The coalition exist of parties that are all centric, but still come from both sides of the spectrum and they do not manage to create an overarching story to bind the people. 

The left comes with the usual story: too much there for the rich (I’m not a leftist so I think their arguments are wrong or ignorant), better to ask someone else about it. 

On the right we see the issues that are similar to the whole EU: immigration, Problems with integration, a erosion of democracy (they are arrogant refusing debating about important issues, influence should-be studies, have removed the referendum), climate (there is a law in progress which binds us to 95% CO2 reduction in 2050: the new green deal on steroids basically), loss of soeveignity to the EU; among others.

The regressive tax law is a climate law that has already been spoken of is that climate law. The left agrees with the necessity but finds corporations don’t have to pay for it (which is true in a sense, but if they have to pay they will IMHO raise prises so that it is still the citizens that have to pay so the presumption of the left this can change is false) and the right is less convinced and thinks the plans will be detrimental to our economy.

3846,"In recent years, it has become painfully common to read about the “crisis” facing social democracy. Across Europe, social-democratic parties have slipped to historic lows in polls and election results, often losing their status as major players in their countries’ politics in the process.

Nowhere is this story truer than in Germany, the original home of social democracy. After polling consistently over 40 per cent in the 1970s and 1990s, the Social-Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) scored barely 20 per cent at the last election in 2017. It has since sunk to below 15 per cent in the polls, prompting the talking-point that the party is now the least popular it has been since Friedrich Engels was a member.

Efforts by the party to overcome its current weakness have had little effect. Neither the leaderships of Martin Schulz, former president of the European Parliament, nor Andrea Nahles, a prominent voice on the SPD’s left wing, have proved able to reverse the party’s decline.

This has led party members to look abroad for inspiration, especially to the UK, where the Labour Party has largely bucked the trend of social-democratic decline. Kevin Kühnert, leader of the SPD’s “JuSo” youth wing, has been especially attuned to developments on the British left, and has been explicit about the party’s need to learn from the “traditional political answers” Labour has offered under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn – particularly its unabashed commitment to the resurrection of “socialist democracy”.

Kühnert’s Anglophile strategy has rich historical precedent. In the 1890s, Eduard Bernstein, the grandfather of German social democracy, was so influenced by the Fabian Society that his SPD colleagues accused him of seeing the world through “English spectacles”. After the First World War, Weimar Germany’s socialist periodicals – Neue Zeit, Gesellschaft, Sozialistische Monatshefte – regularly featured articles by major figures on the British left: Clement Attlee, Ramsay MacDonald, G.D.H. Cole, John Maynard Keynes.

So what can the German left learn from Corbyn’s transformation of the Labour Party? Perhaps the greatest lesson is that “same old, same old” neoliberalism – remorseless privatisation, financialisation, austerity, deregulation, and a shrinking state – has become, for the left, a losing game. Labour under Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and Ed Miliband became a pale echo of the party’s rich progressive tradition – to put it unkindly, “Toryism with a human face”. Likewise, the SPD suffered immeasurably from cleaving to the stale doctrines of the Gerhard Schröder years, to which it shackled itself through a total of ten years of grand coalition with Angela Merkel’s CDU since 2005.

Instead, like Corbyn’s Labour, the SPD needs to craft a new ideology – one that carefully balances looking back to before neoliberalism, and looking forward, beyond it. It needs a vision that does not try to fix the status quo, but to replace it: it needs, in short, to embrace anti-capitalism in a meaningful way.

The German left must also learn from the success of Momentum – an activist organisation that started by focusing on one issue, then gradually expanded its mission to push for greater change. For Momentum, that issue was ensuring Corbyn’s election as leader. For the German left, the likeliest candidate is Kühnert’s 2018 “NoGroKo” campaign against the grand coalition. The SPD’s electoral weakness has borne out Kühnert’s arguments against its participation in government – and the German left need to mobilise around this issue, focusing on taking the SPD into opposition, where it has the breathing room to achieve meaningful ideological renewal.

But above all, the SPD must learn the rewards of keeping the left united, across parties and among the electorate. The signal marker of Labour strategy under Corbyn has been to preserve the alliance between the post-industrial working class and metropolitan university graduates. This has meant doubling down on what these groups agree on (welfare, healthcare, housing) while carefully negotiating – with studied vagueness – what they do not (Brexit, trade, immigration). The result has been the formation of a credible left opposition force in Britain for the first time in nearly 40 years.

Yet while Labour is still a united party, the German left is split. In the 1990s and 2000s, the SPD failed to absorb – even rejected – the various post-communist left currents that coalesced in 2007 into Die Linke, a party that has spent most of the last decade resolutely locked at 9-10 per cent in the polls. Divisions over East Germany’s legacy and repeated state surveillance scandals have merely been the latest grim chapter in the fraught history of fragmentation on the German left; yet they have not prevented the formation of “red-red” SPD-Die Linke coalitions at the state level.

Ultimately, the SPD must accept that its future does not lie in eternal coalitions with the CDU, but with the left around Die Linke. Given its parlous electoral state, the SPD must abandon its path-dependent centrism and open the door to pursuing red-red strategy at the national level, in order to bring about the ideological reinvention, strategic alignment, and eventual reunification of German social democracy.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/aqqiel/how_the_german_left_is_looking_to_jeremy_corbyn/eghurqa/,xbettel,1550189300

&gt; casting off national identities that have been held for centuries and handing power over to distant politicans

Same can be said of nation states. Many regional identities have been lost in the pursuit of a unified national identity, which often entails the suppression of any groups which don't conform to it.

&gt;I’m accusatory towards you because you are spreading misinformation in your original comment, not because of your use of the word ‘Cultural Appropriation’. 

Now that's quite a harsh verdict. I have read quite a bit more about the origin and the controversy surrounding the term and I still think that in the almost ten years since it was coined in regard to the american tribes, the usage has become much broader.

&gt;But that won’t change the fact, that it is used from people to imply that other people using “their” culture to nettle them and portray a stereotype, what is racism. And that’s the clue what I mean with moral, if you point out somebody for conducting unmoral behavior you are on the correct side of moral. If you see the power dynamic that ‘Cultural Appropriation’ has, as described in my comment above, you can see how the person pointing ‘Cultural Appropriation’ out is on the good side of moral and the accused is on the other side.

So you propose to use the word racism instead of cultural approbation because it is less of a moral condemnation? I am not a native speaker, but to me, ""racism"" implies a much stronger moral judgment than ""cultural approbation"". And since it is at the same time much more unspecific, I feel like there's value in using the term, even in other contexts than native americans.

Linking American propaganda news stories does not count as a proof but you're too retarded to understand that.
Your OWN president said there were no WMDs yet you continue to say otherwise which proves just how dumb you are.

&gt; You will not answer me because your nation is Serbia so you are into genocide and creating dictators not getting rid of dictators. You are upset because the US stopped you from committing genocide in Kosovo.

Nice bait. There was no genocide in Yugoslavia nor Kosovo and there was no dictator leading Serbia. I bet you don't even know where Serbia is let alone Europe.

&gt; Again taking out Saddam and stopping YOUR nation from committing genocide in Kosovo are far better things than your nation has ever done.

Lol okay. Al Qaeda destroying your shitty towers and killing 3000 people was better than all the things the US ever did.
 
&gt; as for Libya the US went along but that was more Frances and Europe's idea. I would have to research it but I think they wanted us involved because they only had about weeks worth of bombs on hand.

Yes, keep blaming other countries for destruction, massacres and the chaos your degenerate nation has created.

&gt; Like I said, for you it is zero because your nation is more into creating ruthless dictators and committing genocide than stopping them.

4144,"I personally don't mind a customs border in the Irish Sea, but it's politically unacceptable for the UK to give the EU that (+ the exit bill) while getting nothing in return. If I were Prime Minister my conditions for this would be:

- Northern Ireland's economy would be decimated by trade tarrifs with Great Britain, so the trade deal must keep EU-UK trade as close to single market terms as possible, prehaps this is through a EU-GB DCFTA.

- If the UK is to agree to regulatory alignment under a DCFTA, it must receive a level of imput over those regulations, I believe the arrangements currently enjoyed by the EFTA members under their EEA agreement would work.

- The UK continues to contribute to the EU budget, but a smaller amount than is currently the case, again more along the lines of EFTA members (or whatever DCFTA partners would pay if they were wealthy enough).

- A political declaration by the UK and Ireland, and the EU if they want, that Northern Ireland remains under British sovereignty and the Good Friday Agreement, along with Northern Ireland's right to secede, stands.

- The deal to be approved via referendum by the people of Northern Ireland.

Brexiteers get the end of free movement, withdrawal from the customs union and an end to political integration.

Remainers get free trade and therefore the economy protected, as well as positive close relations with the EU.

Northern Irish Nationalists get to keep living in Northern Ireland as if it is essentially part of Ireland and a small symbolic step towards reunification.

Northern Irish Unionists only miss out on tarrif-free goods from outside the EU and UK, and the referendum and declaration softens any feelings of betrayal or abandonment.

No one gets everything they want but no one gets thrown under the bus either. Can't happen because the UK doesn't want regulatory alignment and because the EU doesn't want to talk about trade until the UK has given it everything it wants.

That will be called cherrypicking, but if the EU wants the UK to compromise it's internal market they should expect to do the same.

Alternatively, the EU could agree to a backstop time limit (with extension provisions) and the deal would be agreed tomorrow. One sentence is all it takes to prevent No Deal and all that the EU believes that will bring to Northern Ireland. 

I understand the worries that we can't be trusted but the UK has wanted a deal from Day 1, it's the EU who has been colder on the idea so you'll forgive me for not wanting the UK legally bound into a customs union it has no control over and can't leave, potentially forever.",Land of Hope and Glory (results may vary),/r/europe/comments/aqcwot/eu_officials_uk_only_pretending_to_negotiate_over/egh0c84/,MrFlatcap,1550167580

""NO U"" is an argument which I expected from an American so no surprise. 

&gt; Actually thousands of chemical weapons were found in Iraq after the invasion. Granted those were just a small remnant of what he had before but yes Saddam had WMD and used them against his own civilians.

Then why did your president say [there was no WMD's in Iraq?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxoDAnnFoL4) Oh wait I guess an Ameritard siting in his mother's basement knows better than the president himself.

&gt; Saddam did have very large stockpiles of WMD and he agreed to let inspectors verify that he was destroying them after his defeat in Desert Storm. However, he never actually let the inspectors verify that he was destroying them despite getting about 12 to 14 UN resolutions demanding that he do so. All of which he agreed to and none of which he complied with. As it turns out he did actually destroy most of them and claimed to have done so but again he never produced evidence of this and never let the inspectors verify. He was a ruthless dictator with a long history of lies and he was not believed. I put that blame on him more than the people that did not believe him.

And how much UN resolutions were voted against other countries which they didn't respect? Dozens and dozens, but I don't see anyone using that as a pretext to invade someone.

&gt; More fake news.What country **are from** and what did your intelligence community say about WMD in 2003?

Seems you can't even write properly in your mother language. Let me tell you, it doesn't matter where I'm from. Stop changing the subject.

&gt; I agree that things have not gone as well as they could and have been more costly than hoped but if taking out a ruthless dictator is what tops the bad list of things we have done, I can live with that.

Yeah, taking out a president of a sovereign nation really boosts American egos right? Just like taking out Gaddafi in Libya who made Libya the richest nation in Africa where people lived in peace and prospered, just because he disagreed with your criminal regime.

&gt; How many ruthless dictators has your country taken out?

Zero. You wanna know why? Because we respect sovereignty of other nations, and that's why countries don't [wish our death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_sQ8kxtylg).

&gt;Debation and voting is what we have assemebelies for

Sure, but an online platform makes that much more practical as long as everyone carries a device to access the internet. With an online platform, one wouldn't need to travel physically to a place, personnally meet other actiists, etc. to prepare and craft a proposition, they could do it from home. This has the potential to engage people who wouldn't mobbilize otherwise due to real life issues. 

&gt;Shit relay need to read ahead before i comment

Indeed you really need to. I acknowledged already most of the limitations you raise and openly say we need to work on them before e-democracy becomes feasible. Technologies need to be made more secure, privacy needs to be ensured, citizens need to be more informed, they need to be also taught to engage more in the public scene. E-democracy indeed can't be feasible if we don't manage to  overcome those huge issues.

Your size objection is wrong. Cities like Madrid or Paris already have implemented participatory measures like a participatory budget or an open suggestions platform. It's working pretty well, and those cities have a bigger population than my whole country. A whole state in my country used an online platform to run a popular consultation for people to comment and debate on an official policy proposal, and it ran perfectly.

I however agree that we can't get rid completely of representatives at the risk of alienating too many people from the decision making process, which would be the opposite of what we want to achieve. I'm rather a proponent of liquid democracy (look it up), where people can choose either to participate directly or choose a delegate instead, and change their mind frequently depending on the issues. This is a nice mix between having representatives for people who can't or don't want to participate, and having opportunities for people who wish to do so to be more active in political decision-making. This would allow someone to, for example, directly participate in decision making on matter of education policy but rely on a representative for economic affairs; with the whole system being fluid and able to accomodate different preferences.

&gt;the curent lack of participations we are seing has nothing to do with the fact that voting happens on paper

I'm not talking merely about electoral participation. I am talking about implementing measures involving more citizens and the civil society in decision making (participatory democracy, look up the concept as was developed by, among others, Benjamin Barber). 

It seems you're stuck on the idea that I am proposing we take ICTs and simply implement them in the political systems we already have. No. I am proposing to change the political system to accomodate for the existence of ICTs and involve more citizens for more accountability and responsiveness of the government.

&gt;IMHO it shouldnt be introduced at all

Why not? Do you not want to be able to have a say on your city's budget? Imagine if you and your neighbours think it would be great too renovate the neighbourhood park. Wouldn't it be great if you could propose it on the city's platform, people could debate on it and then it could be implemented as an official policy by the city? 

Wouldn't it be great if governments had an easy way to determine if a policy they think of implementing is actually desired by the population? They could run an online consultation process, have the people debate and propose changes, have them vote on those changes, and have an actual impact on the decision?

Or, you could also have an online e-procurement platform, so that citizens and civil society actors could see the procurement processes and have a say on them instead of having procurement ran behind closed doors.",,/r/europe/comments/aqhtgp/switzerland_offers_cash_to_hackers_who_can_crack/eggpt9e/,Valakhan,1550160308

I hate it that there is still so much that would need to be clarified by courts  and national bodies but that's how EU directives go. I would have appreciated some of that damned EU precision (like in the bendy bananas /s) here and clear language. 

I simply disagree with the OP that people only oppose this directive only if they are paid Google shills. I also disagree with what others are saying that whoever supports this is a paid publisher shill. Calling the opposing side to be in someone's pocket without bringing arguments is not helping the discussion.

4283,"&gt; I’ll take your word, as I can’t be bothered to look back atm

That's usually a bad idea and that's exactly my main point in this discussion. :)

&gt; the wording was very vague

The specifics regarding the exact definition of small enterprises were only recently added, so you can imagine why people are assuming the worst and not bothering to check the latest version of the text of the law.

I'm against it myself because, although I believe we need such a law, I think that it should be thoroughly discussed in a public manner before it's implemented. This has been going on but people mostly ignore it and stick to the generic fear-mongering. :|

The initial draft was worse in many aspects but it never said what people say online. People really like to exaggerate things.

&gt; If these “best efforts” are indeed poorly defined (feel free to correct me, might look back in a few hours though), then the company has a reason to restrict its users in order to avoid a lawsuit.

They're intentionally loosely defined to a degree because the EU is not a federation. It's up to each country to draft the specifics into local laws. That's how EU directives work.

&gt; The GDPR offered no reason to restrict its users, as it was all up to the company.

This new law poses no restrictions on users. It poses potential liability on big companies like Facebook and Youtube for copyright infringing content people post. GDPR does a similar thing whereas it sanctions Facebook and others like it when anyone posts private info of others and the info isn't taken down via internal processes.

In the case of GDPR, your personal info is like copyrighted content in the new EU directive. Anyone can spam post it but only the owner can post it legally. :)

&gt; A copyright reform is indeed needed, I just disagree with the methods Article 13 proposes.

i also think that it could use a few more amendments in order to properly define many things, but my point is that people are highly exaggerating in their criticism and that we should read it for ourselves instead of believing random online propaganda about it.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/apjdps/article_13_was_purposefully_designed_to_be_awful/eggq90f/,adevland,1550160624

&gt;
 All attacks that fall in the broad denial of service and resource starvation categories.

  Social engineering attacks on operators or employees of Swiss Post, its subsidiaries and contract partners such
as Scytl and SCRT.
&gt;
  Attacks on the set-up of the vote and the clean-up after tallying of the e-voting results.
&gt;
  Physical attacks on people, buildings and devices.
&gt;
  Attacks that assume that a voter is not following the official instructions (e.g. hiding the return codes is out-ofscope).
&gt;
  Attacks that exploit the client in order to spy on the vote of the individual voter (client-side privacy of the vote).
Voter privacy attacks based on the use of keyloggers, screen recorders or other mechanisms for capturing the
behaviour of the voter in the device.
&gt;
  Attacks on the systems of SCRT.
&gt;
 Attacks on administrative and surrounding systems that are not used for e-voting exclusively (this includes DNS,
NTP, routers, systems of the ISP, etc.).
&gt;
  Attacks on the systems used to distribute the e-voting cards electronically (the productive e-voting system
distributes the voting cards physically on paper. For the PIT programme, the voting cards are distributed in
digital format to eliminate registration via postal address).

However none of these are off-limits when it comes to rigging an actual election.

There's https (encryption) for that.

There are also random sampling tests you can do to make sure the votes that end up in the official db are the same as the ones you get on your instance given the same input.

If it's open source, you can verify the binaries in many ways.

You can compile the code yourself and verify the hash code of the binary on the official instance to make sure it matches yours. That's how you can verify the authenticity of pre-compiled packages in Linux repositories.

You could also do random sampling of input and output data and by that I mean to compare the output of the official server with the output of the code which you yourself compiled given the same input.

You could also get read-only access to the database and monitor the entire voting process to make sure nobody alters data outside of the application.

Now, that's still not the actual raw data. Recently I've been going over all kinds of open data, and by chance Eurostat's crime data, and to me it seems like it's a bit more difficult to interpret as the posted image suggests. The data is not uniform, there's quite a bit of variance in what each country reports. For example, a country may (or may not) report numbers for people suspected, arrested, prosecuted, or convicted for said crimes. Or victims of said crimes. I found it quite difficult to come up even with a consistent single number for ""this many people were killed in this country on this year"" (as not all countries report victims).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure Eurostat's graphmakers have been able to come up with pretty much the most correct number for each country, but I'm not sure the accuracy for debates like ""this country had 26 killings and this one 23, so it's safer"" is there.",,/r/europe/comments/aqhta7/intentional_homicides_in_the_eu_per_100_000/egg9sma/,Jason9mm,1550145707

4455,"The classic bikes allow you to sit upright, which is safer in traffic: cars see you, and you are high enough to see over other cars. It’s also less straining on your body; old people can still ride a city bike even if they need a stroller or cane when walking. You need good knees but a bad back isn’t a huge problem.

The upright sitting makes it more social: easier to chat and make contact.

They are more versatile for transport: you can install kids seats easily on front and back, or have an adult passenger riding on the back. 

They are more stable and maneuverable at slow speeds.

They’re easier to repair, are more durable (especially the simple 1 or 3-gear system ones) cheaper to buy, less likely to get stolen. Many also come with back-pedal brakes (mandatory for kids’ bikes) which are safer to use and don’t require you to have both hands on the wheel. And they reduce the risk of flipping over by (accidentally) only using the front wheel brake.

The fact that these models are ubiquitous means that having a faster bike is not an advantage anymore in a commute. City cycle paths are crowded in rush hours and overtaking is often impossible or risky and mostly pointless: after passing one group you’ll just be stuck behind the next bunch of three-abreast cyclists who are too busy chatting to notice you want to pass. You and your € 1000+ aren’t going to get to work much faster.

4466,"&gt; Where does this idea come from that we have an influence over Orbán and Kaczynski? That we can somehow moderate their behaviour? If Germany, France but even the US did not achieve that, we would we be able to? The only people who are able to are Polish and Hungarian voters.

Because we're central Europeans, not those ""condescending Westerners"" lecturing others on how to live. If the Czechs remain calm, it will likely calm down the Slovaks as well and their combined voice in V4 would further help defuse tensions. Or so I believe, it's just speculation of course as this reasonable course of action wasn't considered.

&gt; Anyone doing that would be committing a political suicide.

That's what you say, but we don't know. I tend to believe that once it turned out that these people did not bring the apocalypse, the whole refugee issue would get defused, or at least taken down a bit. People could then point to the fact that we did in fact accept a couple thousand refugees and nothing bad has really happened, so what was the fuss about.

&gt; You can't just say 'well, these people are idiots, let's ignore them'. 

I can, the politicians can't. But they can use other words and show some personal courage.

4468,"In some parts of central Europe it'll eventually either be travel a longer distance to an airport serving your destination before even getting on a plane, or change planes. The established European airlines control a majority of slots, and while slots are regularly re-allocated it works in a way favoring whoever already holds the slot - so for airlines trying to increase the Europe business there's no other option but code sharing, if they want direct flights.

Expanding airports would work in theory, but it's not realistic. The big airports are close to capacity, and as they're in densely populated areas expanding won't happen without a multi decade legal battle, if at all. The expansions we're currently seeing built have started 20+ years ago, and I think future expansions will take even longer to go through.

Flight tickets are already ridiculously cheap, so I don't see prices going down for non-direct flights. I'd expect more that eventually you'll pay a premium for direct flights, with them being mostly short distance and to destinations with a lot of business travellers, and a few hub airports with a huge entertainment program emerge to make dealing with connecting planes more appealing to the masses.",,/r/europe/comments/aqgrme/airbus_says_a380_superjumbo_production_will_end/egga1vq/,schmerzapfel,1550146048

At the same time 44.7% identified as ethnically Latvian, 39.4% as Russian, 3.7% as Belarusian,  3.4% as Ukrainian.

In 2018 in Riga 47.0% identified as ethnically Latvian, 36.8% as Russian, 3.7% as Belarusian,  3.4% as Ukrainian.

4597,"&gt; What I mean is that we missed the opportunity presented by a German Chancellor who is very pro-Czech (and generally sympathetic of ex-communist countries in general) to strike a closer political alliance.

Yeah, I generally agree that we could have played our card a bit better, however I find the whole 'we could be a bridge between Germany and Poland/Hungary' concept quite strange. Slovaks try to play this card a lot too, but the problem is that it's just not gonna happen. Where does this idea come from that we have an influence over Orbán and Kaczynski? That we can somehow moderate their behaviour? If Germany, France but even the US did not achieve that, we would we be able to? The only people who are able to are Polish and Hungarian voters.

&gt; ook Angela, we don't agree with you on migration, but we appreciate the need to reach an agreement. So here, we'll take a couple thousand Syrian Christians to show solidarity

Sure, but you probably do remember how it all turned out with the Iraqi Christians. I am pretty sure it would be quite similar with Syrian Christians. All politicians (in democratic countries) to some extent have to work with the constraints from the population. It's just not feasible here to relocate thousands of Middle Eastern refugees. Anyone doing that would be committing a political suicide. And if something would invite Russia and China even more in, this would be it. You can't just say 'well, these people are idiots, let's ignore them'. They are still gonna be here, they are still going to be voting, let's not put more fuel to the fire and instead hope that it will eventually diminish by itself. There are already signs that it is diminishing.

4598,"Not baiting or anything but afaik the dispute was more historical than anything else. 

In short, North Macedonians raising monuments of Filippos and Alexander the Great claiming both of them were slavs, who spoke slavic, while anyone with basic historical knowledge should know that slavic tribes first appeared in the balkans around 6th century after christ (during byzantine era), Filippos was Greek, Alexander was Greek, his tutor was Aristotle, Ancient Kingdom of Macedonia was of Greek culture and Alexander's Persian expedition was manned by ""10.000 Greeks"" from all of Greek city-states and kingdoms (except Spartans who didn't wanna join).

The latest deal was an attempt to clear things out and clarify that North Macedonia is not related to Ancient Macedonia in any way, they just basically ""borrow"" the name without any other historical or territorial claims.

The reason why people from both sides protested against the deal is that Greeks are afraid the rest of the world will forget history in 50 years from now and will consider North Macedonians to be descendants of Ancient Macedonians (who were Greeks) therefore re-igniting historical and territorial dispute, while, North Macedonians (especially the old folks) were propagated at school that they indeed had some connection to Alexander the Great so now they feel something is being stolen from them.

On a people's level, Greeks and North Macedonians are getting along pretty well. In my family for example there are marriages between the two. This has mostly started as a political problem from the FYROM side because they speak Bulgarian and so they needed a way to separate themselves from Bulgarians to avoid being annexed when Yugoslavia fell apart.
There has been a proposition for FYROM to be named ""Slavomakedonia"" which I think would be a good solution since the name itself identifies them as slavs, however, 30% of FYROM population is Albanian and they would never accept this name.
If you ask me, as a Greek I'd gladly let them have the name, history and everything if they changed to Greek language and culture as an independent nation of Greek culture (same as Cyprus that is not part of Greece but is of Greek culture), however, this would probably trigger another balkan war as Albanians and Bulgarians would attack FYROM to ""protect"" their ""minorities"" from being converted to Greek culture.

These cases are not similar at all when you're talking about territorial waters. There is no analogue to the Aegean-Med-Straits geography and sovereign ownership in southeast Asia. As for the EEZs: their claims are still mostly unenforced claims as well, with no agreement on who owns what. Looking over there actually lends credence to the idea that UNCLOS is not a universally accepted or even well-applied treaty.

&gt; you may say that black sea-mediterranea is so unique, though you say nothing to support it, so its more questionable than not.

As examples: The Roman Empire, ancient Greek colonies, British obsession (and later on, dominance) of the Mediterranean, the historical struggle of Russia to access the basin as a supply route all are results of or made possible by the geography in question. There is no set of straits or canals in existence that is more strategically valuable than the Bosporus/Gibraltar/Suez though Malacca probably came close at a few points in history.

&gt; i cannot see any uniqueness, rather annoyance from turkeys part that the agean is an archipelago, from which 99.5% of the islands spread all over it are greek.

To be clear: Greece does not assert that the islands constitute an archipelago under the UN definition. 

And the ownership of an island does not mean that you are immediately entitled to an arbitrarily defined patch of water around it.

&gt; and the point of mentioning them is what turkey says about how ""unfair"" is that greek islands block turkey. the greek islands are there like it or not and they wont have special conditions because turkey says so.

The islands aren't what would ""block"" Turkey in this case, it's the claimed territorial waters. Turkey agreed with Greece to extend said waters from 3nm to 6nm in a peaceful manner because the situation would have remained workable.

The Greek isles are already subject to a number of special regimes laid down in various treaties, there is no reason for the territorial water expansion or the EEZ claim to be accepted without condition.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/aprihy/eu_exclusive_economic_zones/egg1d16/,_Whoop,1550131521

Im not trying to flame anybody, I am just sick of people who dont know what they are talking about and are still fuelling the disagreement, be it foreginers, macedonians or greeks.
Gruevski's government definatelly didnt do much to help the situation, dont get me wrong, im neither supporting him or his party not do I agree with where they were taking the country. That being said, Im fairly certain they would not have gotten that far claiming half of Greece and Bulgaria's history if the name dispute did not arise in the first place.
Also, if you think im ignoring something, please point it out. I'll do the same - see how you ignored everything I said about the products :)
in Europe, and probably in most of the world there have been plenty of situations like this one, however what is unique to this one is that a) its on the fucking balkans and b) it involved two countries that in the minds of their populations are solely defined by history in Greece's case and the non-existing history in Macedonia's case.

By the way, you know there is a region in France called Brittany right? How many times has France object to Great Brittain for its name, or even more so claiming that it is not a real country?

I live in part of Bulgaria that is within the region of Macedonia, I have never in my life called Macedonian thus no confusion.

The issue of territorial claim could have been sold by bilateral treary, which was proposed numerous times. Also their government issued unilateral declarations both domestically and on international fora addressing the issue directly and confirming that they are not interested in redrawing borders. Also, as per international law, as of after WW II states cannot claim territory that they have occupied as their own because the principle of self determination and the specific prohibition of doing that. So in the unlikely event of Macedonia becoming a super power who can afford to disregard a potential UN Security Council resolution, which inevitably would have declared the matter as threat to the peace (UN speak for stop or we send the troops) and conquers the rest of Macedonia, it would still be considered illegal occupataion under international law. Hense there was a ""referendum"" in Crimea.

Too lazy to google the term, but when you protect  a certain product with a ""territorial trademark???"" No matter how the territory is called, it is bound by certain geographical limits. So if a product is produced in the greek region of Macedonia and has the intellectual property protection for that, as soon as Macedonia (the country) starts marketing their product in that manner Greece would take the matter to the World Intellectual Property Organisation and sue them for a sum equal to 70% of their miessarble GDP.

If it would run alone in the elections then it would get (maybe) 0.5% of votes while the fidesz would get the 2/3 of the votes (because of the bad election-system). But why do FIDESZ needs KDNP then? I guess only because it's name: Chrisrian Democratic People's Party. So by this, Fidesz looks soo christian and conservative. 

The second biggest party (Jobbik) is started as a far right party. Now Jobbik is tryting to purge itself from the far right elements and turn into a central-right winged party (as the fidesz was in 98-2002).

4730,"Your mistake here is assuming everyone that's against uncontrolled and unregulated immigration also has far right economic views of letting the free market run itself with little to no government regulation. 

If the increase supply of unskilled labor then the salary of unskilled labor goes down and the lower middle class vanishes which is what has happened. If you introduce workers in the country illegally that are too afraid to complain about employers that are paying less than minimum wage, providing unsafe working conditions, or ignoring laws meant to protect workers' rights then you make those laws meaningless for the jobs that need them the most. 

Mass immigration of unskilled labor is great for wealthy or skilled people who will not have their employment or financial situation changed and will be able to get certain goods or services cheaper. It is bad for anyone that thinks every job should provide a good livable wage and the quality of life expected in a development country no matter how ""unwanted"" the job supposedly is. 

As FDR put it:

&gt;[“In my Inaugural I laid down the simple proposition that nobody is going to starve in this country. It seems to me to be equally plain that no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country. By ""business"" I mean the whole of commerce as well as the whole of industry; by workers I mean all workers, the white collar class as well as the men in overalls; and by living wages I mean more than a bare subsistence level-I mean the wages of decent living.""](http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/odnirast.html)

If a job can only be filled by people too afraid to make their employers follow government laws and regulations then that job shouldn't exist.

On the other hand, the vast majority of americans don't want to have a wall in their border, and so Trump needs to comply with that and he finally will not build it, although if he wanted to do sdo against the people's will, he could declare a national emergency.

Trump was elected with a voting system that was **agreed by the majority** of the people and was in use for many years. And that is why Trump is the President now.

My girlfriend is an avid gaeilgeoir. My father also likes to start most of his conversations with a few lines in Irish.

I can understand what you're saying, but if 73% of people in Wales report having no skills in Welsh at all, then that would suggest very strongly that the 19% who 'can speak welsh' don't speak it daily. Know what I mean?

Again, I'm not knocking welsh. I hope that it takes off like a rocket. It's a good thing for their culture in my mind.

I would say that given the status of Irish currently, the real target should be getting people into the 'weekly' band. The 'daily' band is really only in the gaeltacht. The language is on life support at the moment, and its not going to become the day-to-day language for the majority of the country any time soon, but that doesn't stop people from having a conversation in Irish once in a while.

Plus they say that there's no demand for freights to travel on trains at this time, maybe because there's no infrastructure?
One another thing is that the minister Toninelli says that money spared from scrapping this project will be used in others important infrastructures around Italy, ""forgetting"" the detail that the EU will not give Italy funds for the other projects Toninelli has in his mind. 
Oh, i almost forgot to mention the fact that the 5 Star Movement made a fierce opposition to the *Gronda*, an important Highway whose purpose is to ease the traffic on highways around Genoa. The new route has never been built and we all see what happened last summer at Morandi Bridge.
Another great work criticized by the 5Stars is the *Terzo Valico dei Giovi* railway: a line that links Genoa with Novi Ligure/Tortona, included in the European Rhine–Alpine Corridor (Rotterdam-Köln-Basel-Milan-Genoa), that gives the opportunity to freights coming from South to arrive at the Port of Genoa and reach Northern Europe by train.

4954,"Sorry.. I can't leave this alone because you're dead wrong and I don't want people to read it and actually think what you say makes sense;

For a penal offence (a.k.a. a crime -- the one's that could get stick in your permanent record as you say) it doesn't matter if the victim feels offended or not; E.g. If someone goes to a doctor and tells him a friend has beaten him (the doctor has to call the police) then they might fill a complaint only if his injuries are not severe enough for the law to consider them an infraction (penal offence)... If they are severe enough or weapons have been used then it doesn't matter if you fill a complaint or not.. Police will investigate and the agressor will get prosecuted; If the attack isn't sever enough to be considered an infraction and you fill a complaint then the agressor will get a fine, you may make insurance claims (if aplicable) and you might sue him in a civil case later on for damages (in a time frame specified by the law) but that's it..

There are, indeed, some situations where there is no case without a complaint even for a crime. Situations like home invasion, rape, etc... In these kind of scenarios you are legally obliged to do it as soon as possible or justify why you didn't complain earlier; Bassicaly, with the exception of rape I don't know any infraction for which a complaint will be accepted if not done ASAP (unless extorsion or fear is involved); Imagine being invited into a home and after 2 days that person calling the police on you..

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So it is up to journalist now to make that case into existance - or not - as her testimony would be crucial.  
&gt;  
&gt;And videos - as well as cases filed by those people for showing their images while doing it - would be crowned proof.

So I'm going to repeat myself.. this makes no sence because it doesn't matter how the journalist feals about it... And even if you would be right about this would be extorsion (which is a damn serious thing);

You are dead wrong about the business model of youtube. Facebook is another creature, their site is plastered by ads. 

But youtube, or most other hosts? To avoid claims like yours, and lessen potential liability they only put ads on partnered videos. 

So when © infringement does happen, all it does is cost them money in hosting fees. That's why Google launched ContentID in the fist place, because keeping © contend off is in both their and the holders interest.  However Content ID is only available for major holders, like record labels, film studios and television networks. And it already has huge issues with false positives, which is why content ID is currently [closed](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311402?hl=en) for new applicants. 


You keep saying Google makes money from © infringement, or that infringement is their business models. You are stuck in 2009. All of the most viewed channels and videos on youtube have either licenced their content, or it's ""original""  content. So new rules for © won't change how much © there is on youtube. However the stricter liabilites can force youtube to block way more content / access restrict than it currently does. 


So this is about regulation in the end. I'm fine with regulation of these platforms, but not for ©. And not in a way that is as detrimental to the users as this will be. I agree the developed world needs © reform, but not in a way that gives more power to © owners or further lengthens the terms of ownership. 

If you want to go after the platforms, hit them for the harmful content, the storing of user data, or the non consensual research or the monopolistic business models. 

But © infringement is a problem they solved on their own.

This really annoys me because the channel is completely government funded, so are bidding for broadcast rights for these games with public money, and then they refuse to make it accessible to the absolute majority of the population.

Whether what they did was wrong? I had given this much consideration, and I have to say I am glad there are people ready to protest against what the national TV has become: in this sense, I don't see the fact of the protest itself as wrong. 

Is the form of the protest faulty here? Perhaps it was too confrontational, I'd have opted for something less abrasive - so is that their fault? If so, then I don't consider it to be one worthy of a witch-hunt and such a wide condemnation, which - to my eyes - is blowing this thing out of proportion.

My mistake: *""At 16:00 local time (13:00 UTC), the crew asked for a deviation of 20 nautical miles (37 km) to the left (north) of course, on airway L980, due to weather conditions. This request was also approved by Dnipro Control ATC. The crew then asked if they could climb to FL 340, which was rejected as this flight level was not available, so MH17 remained at FL 330. At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), Dnipro Control noticed that the flight was 3.6 nautical miles (6.7 km) north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track.""*

&amp;nbsp;

But even if the concern was about fuel, we can do some rough calculations &amp; see that if MH 17 was diverted around Donetsk, it would get to its destination in Malaysia with about 1.5 hours additional flight time. That sounds good, until you consider how little time that leaves them should the airport not be operational, they are in a lengthy holding pattern, or some other issue cause a significant delay.

There’s a few reasons for that. First, they defaulted in 1998 so they got a relatively clean slate not so long ago. Second, they are reliant on commodity prices which in some years make up more than 50% of government revenue. Everyone with a little bit of common sense understands that commodity prices go down as well as up, so you can absolutely can not overstretch your spending/borrowing (*stares angrily at Hugo Chavez’ grave*) relative to GDP and expect it won’t come back to bite you. Third is that they tend to get themselves in trouble diplomatically, and nobody wants to experience the joys of trying to roll over a massive pile of debt while sanctioned out of EU/US financial markets. 


But because of that, their debt is really low. Even lower than all these factors warrant. They’re not going to go bankrupt.

It wasn't ad hominem, it was meant to the whole category of petty nationalists!

&gt; And to claim that Sami culture is anything remotely the same as Basque is just being incredibly daft. Europe shares a religious heritage based on the Roman Catholic Church, but culture is more than faith. Increasingly so as religion loses its value all the time. Which is why preserving each nations cultural peculiarities and uniqueness is ever more important.

Of course two specific cultures can be very different. But you can also make the same argument at an even more local level. I am from Southern Italy. Is my culture similar as the culture of a person that lived all is life in Milan? Those people are crazy, they eat way too early for ""our"" (Southern Italian) standards.

Do I share all the same values that people from my hometown share? Arguably not, most people from my area absolutely love the sea and everything related. They love spending their summers from 8 am to 8pm laying on the beach. I only care about swimming. 

But there are some things that no matter where you are in Europe, a lot of people will share. A general awareness of European Geography, history, and culture, for example. Maybe you have visited Italy. Maybe I have visited Sweden (which I did). Maybe I can talk with you about football, or other European current events.

Proving again you don't know how the system works

&gt;You see, personally I've never heard about this particular story and still knew that there are issues with Norwegian CPS. If you think it's just a one story that sparked all this mess you're wrong. There are plenty.

It snowballed from there. There's one Lithuanian person whose spent a lot of time spreading false stories. Some parents latched on with their own case.

&gt;It's obviously not the way to raise your child but if you think that it is enough to take it away from it's parents then I don't really know what to say. Set your prorities straight. Living in an orphanage will cause much bigger traumas than living with your not-progressive-enough of a parent.

Physically abusing your child and causing them lifelong trauma is enough to take them away into safety. Of course it is. Do some reading on the psychological research on spanking. Orphanages in Norway are short-term. You stay 3 months maximum. On average there are only 50-70 children in orphanages in all of Norway.

&gt;Progressivism seems to be the hell of a drug for you. Or maybe a new religion? Not everything that is progressive is good

Yeah I know you eastern europeans think that. Stuff like homosexuality, atheism, marijuana, freedom of speech, all bad things.

&gt;There's a huge mess in international relations with another country. We'll see if it's worth to start a diplomatic war over this.

What? You mean about the polish diplomat? That didn't have anything to do with Norwegian CPS. Had to do with him assaulting police officers.

Anyway, to end this. Please prove that the Norwegian CPS remove more children from their homes per capita than other similar countries and that most of these are immigrant children.

5349,"&gt;A union where Luxembourg has as much power as Germany can never work. Absolutely impossible.

A union in which have their own army can't work when you want to push some policies some nations will not ever agree on.

If you want peaceful union you want to move toward least resistance possible line rather than force your hand.

Form out things that everybody agrees on and make that law. Don't push things that only part agree. If there is opposition then work out deal that could provide benefits to opposition party for employing sought by you measures and so on.

&gt;You will know that neither the Council nor the Parliament are proportional to population. They scale up but in a disproportional way which means small countries are very much favoured in terms of per capita representation.

They are not but they do take cues and both France and Germany voice is bigger than rest and that is a problem.

That problem was best shown with UK leave and Eastern Europe debacle vs immigration.

So, you don't give a shit, and to demonstrate as much, you proceed to respond with more contradictory presuppositions, while throwing a temper tantrum in the process.

&gt;The referendum isn't legally binding. The referendum is democratically binding.

*Binding* refers to an obligation that can't be broken. So does *requirement*, which was your choice of words. So, what would stop Parliament from revoking Article 50, other than your fears that it would be unpopular for the Tories among their base?

&gt;So, by...definition, not legally binding...Parliament can do whatever it damn pleases; de facto it cannot.

If it's a non-binding referendum, then how is it an official or authoritative instruction? What specific mechanism stops Parliament from revoking or holding a second referendum?

&gt;Parliament has received a directive from the referendum.

Which you've already agreed that it isn't binding. This doesn't square up, and you know it. What mechanism obligates Parliament from revoking or holding a second referendum?

No, I wrote that Brexit was complex, and you responded with *""maybe politicians should have had a more complex referendum question, but they didn't, and so now they're required to enact said directive.""* Which brings us back to why you're arguing that they're required to enact what you now agree isn't legally binding.

5582,"First link is PR. In second link. there is nothing about nuclear power. Fourth link is just capital cost estimate.

That third link:

* is using FOAK (First of a Kind) cost for Nuclear, so it's likely using Hinkley point C cost (that used cost suggest that). New expensive EPR reactor type that had initial problems that increased cost and incurred delays. Next-gen EPR is supposed to be cheaper, because company producing it knows, that this reactor is not cost-competitive with other current reactors.

* It assumes unrealistically high ~10% cost of debt, that negatively affects nuclear power. With 7% cost of debt report shows FOAK almost competitive with wind and with 3.5% (which is too low rate unless financed by state-owned company) it shows competitive costs.

* Look at map 3.3 in https://www.energy.eu/publications/a07.pdf page 26(24), that shows map of wind energy density. So while cost in North and Baltics sea may be somewhat competitive, for majority of Europe wind is very costly source of electricity. This third link is UK situation, but again without transmission and back-up costs incurred due to the use of intermittent power sources such as wind and solar energy.

&gt; while the cost of nuclear is going up.

This is not true, Lazard report has this wrong, 2017 number is probably based FOAK cost of EPR/AP1000 reactors which is way higher then established competitive reactors (APR-1400, VVER-1200). Details in my previous comment.

To sum it up:

It took me a while to figure out that ""Bergen"" is actually ""Mons"", but since Brussels Airport is outside the Brussels Capital District, it's located in Flanders, you're getting Flemish names even for places deep in Wallonia and the French alternative will not be shown until the exact moment the train passes the Capital District border.

I think I see the EU for what it is, you think you see the EU for what it is. You're not fighting me, you're demonizing me so hopefully others can fight people like me. Where have we heard that before? I'm making comparisons and sharing my thoughts. How do you think this 'fight' will end? When have we, historically, had fights like these? Does your idealism/fighting spirit ring a bell yet?

Is that the route you would take just to keep the EU afloat? Is there any chance of compensation? Who wonders why its hard to make a Brexit deal, when its followers are ready to fight, let alone its elite? Are we in this together or are we forced into this by some?

So lets deduce what it is that you are willing to fight for. It is an ideal. Which ideal is that? Whichever ideal you identify the EU with - apparently not as socialist - I and many others are warning that it comes at the risk of individual securities and liberties. Its process is so similar to that of other historical socialist regimes, that I cannot fathom that others cannot see that this is the European style version of the Soviet Union, utilizing the 2019 zeitgeist of Cultural Marxism. 

Fit in or be fought by our citizens. I think I get the message. Meanwhile in England, they have literal ""Thought Police"" units and atheists are arrested for insulting the Prophet Mohammed on Facebook. Somehow, according to you, this will end well for us. Orwell didn't think so.

A technology where a major accident could make a whole region inhabitable for a couple of hundred years needs to be 100% safe. And nothing men made or supported can ever be 100% safe. 

It's not the greenest either, it is one of the better options when you look at co2 emissions only (hydro and some other renewables still ahead though). But we still dont know where to deposit the nuclear waste!!! In Germany the deposition site that was used so far and every expert said ""yeah that is 100% safe place to deposit our nuclear waste!"" well its running full of water now threatening to contaminate the groundwater in northern germany.  And when we are talking contaminate we are talking about a couple of hundred years, not a decade or 2.  And this happend not even 50 years after we started depositing our nuclear waste there and we need to find a place that will be safe for a couple of thousand years... Not that green in my book.

And then it's also the most expensive energy (and we are not even factoring in the cost of depositing the waste for a couple of hundred years which alone is making every nuclear power plant so inprofitable that is really a joke to even discuss the matter).

For all those reasons it's a dead technology. We should focus on fusion and renewables, everything else is very short sighted and most importantly not efficient in the long run.

5890,"&gt;If every economy is saving, there is no growth.

Balancing your budget is not ""saving"" to me. 

And off course economic activity could exist without the state spending money. It could happen theoretically without any state at all.

I mean, you are literally saying it is IMPOSSIBLE for anybody to say plant 100 apple trees and start selling apples without the state taking debt. It's stupid.

Take an isolated system, like a small island. One guys plants apple trees, another guy learns how to turn the apples into apple juice, another guy bottles it and so on. This is economic growth, and debt does not needed to be included at all.


&gt;So how did the EZ get liquidity? It beat up Greek pensioners, demonized them for making 200 euro more per month than they deemed was appropriate. But never called out the banks that put the EZ in this position.

No -- Greece was bankrupt and decided to get help. EZ and IMF then offered them help, obviously on their conditions. Greece then decided to take the offer.

Greece bankrupted itself and decided itself to take the help. Greece needs to grow up and realize ""the actions you do yourself, is your responsibility, because the person that did your actions is in fact yourself.""


&gt; So the austerity model is not a growth model at all, if there is growth it's a fluke.

Haha, there are many flukes then :) I guess the countries that can do it just doesn't exist then, because economics says they don't exist.

Big news, Bulgaria and Romania does not exist. They make growth while having small state budgets, it isn't possible, hence they aren't there.

&gt;So Italy is right on the money

No they are not. Many countries make it work. Italy needs to do the things the countries that make it work does.

Following EU  requirements for joining cleaned up the political system: the government became more transparent, businesses had to adapt to western standards, those changes brought Western investment and companies that started to compete with the locals and locals had to adopt better policies, benefits for employees etc. No matter how corrupt the government is, if this government sees that they will also benefit from prosperity joining EU brings, in the end, they will improve the standards of living for the most of the population.",,/r/europe/comments/apwvsl/russian_military_intervention_in_ukraine/egd7tuu/,senpuu_kns,1550039790

5992,"&gt; He's also creating 8 producers

Yes, 8 producers of greenhouse gasses.

&gt; Besides, do you not realize that when ""responsible and smart"" people  stop reproducing, ""irresponsible and stupid"" people will take their  place? Or do you think you can successfully make humanity go extinct  this way? If you think there are too many people, you are welcome to  take the exit at any time.

I never said that, I said people should reproduce responsibly. Instead of 8 kids they should opt for 1 or at most 2, any more is unneeded.

&gt; What family budget? They are not even creating families. Childlessness among educated women is well known.

Not every woman has to bear children and not every man has to be a father. If they chose not to have children that's their own choice. And also please top generalizing, if a woman wants to get an university degree that doesn't sentence her to a childless life. A lot of educated women also give birth and then go on to contribute to the GDP growth as well.

&gt; This is a lie. It is still very dangerous to have children at a later  age and freezing eggs is not guaranteed to work and crushes many  ""modern"" women's dreams of having families at old age. Again, you know  all of this and keep lying anyway because it aids in your goal of  population reduction.

There is nothing wrong with a woman having a child in her late 20s or early 30s, medicine is advanced enough for that. You just chose not to admit it because it doesn't fit your views on man-woman relationships from the Middle Ages.
