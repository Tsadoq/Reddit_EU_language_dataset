Meanwhile, a lot of Poles would be living in Germany (Stettin (Szczecin), Danzig (Gdan'sk), for instance), where they would be denied certain rights as well.

Poland lost territory, but the territories they gained had more ethnic Poles in them than within the previous borders. It's a win for Poland.

84,"1) The Berlin Treaty could not have been more irrelevant here. The invasion happened in 1974, which was after the independence of Cyprus in 1960. And what citizens are you talking about? Cypriots, whether Greek or Turkish ethnically, were not citizens of either Greece or Turkey. If you want to find intervention rights, you can find them in the 1960's constitution of the Republic of Cyprus. In any case, the invasion is indeed is regarded as illegal by the UN, as is the self-declared entity ""TRNC"" established in the illegally occupied areas.

2) Reunification, which the Annan Plan wouldn't even really achieve, is not the solution to the problem of illegal occupation. There aren't two entities to reunify. There are areas to liberate, which wouldn't be achieved via the Annan Plan. That's why us Greek Cypriots rejected it. Maybe we are to blame for wanting justice for people whose properties were stolen, people who were killed, people who were raped, people who were displaced, people who went missing, etc. None of these injustices would have been even remotely corrected via the Annan Plan.

PS. Again, the 1963 events, when people from both communities attacked innocent civilians (which I will always disavow), was not what led to the illegal invasion and the 46-year illegal occupation. Turkey used the coup by the Junta of Greece as pretext to invade and then realise their imperialist plans.

I mean to be fair even consultations are largely pro cycling. Almost all of them have a decent majority that say to reduce traffic and to make cycling and walking better. So it's not even like councils should be worried about the vocal few. Not everyone will be happy with changes but as long as many more people are happy then they need to just do it. 

Then the people who do comment against it say dumb things. Like with the big new cycle lane from Southwark to Greenwich you get people saying it'll increase pollution because more traffic and nobody will use it and stuff but the embankment cycle lane proved the opposite. More people use the embankment cycle lane during the rush hours than the 3 motor lanes next to it combined. 

&gt;So... How about a 5 year plan? Be clear that in 5 years you can no longer operate or store a private car within London. Then spend 5 years planning and make the changes with signs and paint over the following year.

Yeah I've thought that too. Announce which main roads parking will be removed from in 5 years time, even have a consultation which many people will ignore because its so far ahead, and then just do it when the time comes.

Most councils in London are safe seats for the party too so why be worried about disappointing a few people. Even Tory places like Westminster and Chelsea are always guaranteed to vote tory so don't worry about losing a vote.

Netherlands had the same, barely anyone cycled anymore, then the gov decided to go back to cycling a priority, a loud minority complained, but then they did it anyway and people there love it now and would never change it back.",,/r/europe/comments/gntrrz/berlin_wants_to_improve_the_situation_with/frfldos/,Benandhispets,1590139301

The US only has foreign policy influence in Europe inasmuch as those foreign policy goals align to begin with. European countries didn't bomb Libya because of American influence, they wanted to anyway. 

The US doesn't occupy parts of Germany because Germany is unwilling to defend itself. The US occupies parts of Germany because the German government doesn't want them to leave. The reason US bases can't leave Germany and just move to Poland is because the air bases would be more vulnerable in Poland.

211,"&gt;Fiscal union will fix the Eurozone

Maybe you're right, but there will be some uncomfortable truths the main proponents of this fiscal union will face.

It would only work when all members states give away a lot of their fiscal independence. Italy for example wouldn't be able to make as much debt as they want when this risks the stability of the fiscal union. They would be forced to do painful reforms they are not willing to do now. We have stability mechanisms already in place but not that much happens when you violate them. 

With a fiscal union it would theoretically be possible to cut a country off from making new debt if this member doesn't cooperate. They wouldn't go bankrupt since the other members would garantee for the old debt but this country would run into a serious budget crisis like in the US with their government shutdowns when Congress can't agree on a budget. At least that's what I expected to happen.

I also know several people who have a car and kind of regret having it as they only really use it like 3 times a year when actually going out of town so they realize what a waste it is.

The opposite is really more interesting at the moment from a spread point of view for Finland and from an economic point of view for Sweden. Will Finland allow their citizens into Sweden?

Also, the Swedish public health agency still discourages travel within the country that's more than two hours away. This is lighter than the recommendations a few weeks ago. The recommendations for tourism abroad for the summer aren't set in stone yet but every time they are asked they say that it should not be expected IIRC. Forbidding something that would be very rare wouldn't change the situation in Sweden considerably.

The thing I have an issue with is the comparisons he makes where he shows snippets from totally separated bicycle systems in what I think is Nijmegen (5:55 in the video). Just before that there is a clip from an intersection right next to Tivoli. 
In general the clips from Copenhagen seems to come from an area about the size of the canal district i Amsterdam. 

The snippet you mention is from the last part of H.C.Andersens Boulevard going south east, which is an eyesore build in the 60's, about 400m south of parlament. The only thing that the bike path is missing IMO is to be raised ca. 15cm to be level withe the sidewalk. By the way, the trees all had to be cut down some years ago due to disease and have not been replanted at a meaningful rate, but I fail to see how that is relevant to bicycle infrastructure.
&gt; I disagree, the video creator even goes to other places in Denmark and shows they lag far behind Copenhagen.

He sows exactly two clips to make a point. One might think that they are selected to do just that.
I currently live i Odense which  arguably has better bicycle infrastructure than Copenhagen why didn't he show clips from here. Those clips are nowhere near representative of the general infrastructure.

302,"&gt; Why are these things unreasonable if you can afford them?

I'm not saying to completely ignore your wants. If you can satisfy your wants while also satisfying your needs then absolutely go for it. Some time this is not possible though, and then you must bite the bullet.

Another key thing you said is ""if you can afford them"". Many people just can't. They buy a home in the suburbs with a long commute time while having very low down payment, based on the wants I wrote above. Then they fall in a negative spiral: They need their work to afford the mortages, so they play it safe at work - no risk, no promotions. Also they can't act on job opportunities because first it's risky and they can't allow risk because of the mortage and secondly they can't move because of the mortage. So how do they increase their income? Work more. They start to work overtime or a second job and on top of that have a high commute time. This starts to affect their mental health. Also they have now a home they are basically not using very much. After 40 years of paying mortage, they are now retired, the kids moved out and now the house is too big and a burden to maintain.

In favor of leaving:

* The model of monitoring aircraft used by US is old and would be expensive to upgrade for little return value.

* Existing spy satellite technology does a better job than predictable flight paths.

* Russia places restrictions on flying over places we want to see, defeating the purpose of the treaty. Responding in kind to try and regain compliance further defeats the purpose and apparently hasn't worked.

* Because the US has better means to collect this kind of intelligence, remaining in the treaty helps Russia more than ourselves.

Against leaving: 

* Nostalgia for arms control agreements. 

* Subsidizes European countries that otherwise don't have access to satellite intelligence.

* North Korea might not join hypothetical, future efforts.

I get that for Europeans, European interests come first. I don't understand why they should come first for the US too.

314,"Ya it's really not a shock that the right keeps rising. All the left has to do is be more reasonable and not support open borders and multiculturalism and show some patriotism. The left was generally more popular for most of post ww2 European history until they went into identity politics and neoliberalism/globalism. But most people do want more worker's rights and social support so they should focus on that, then they will win again.

And ya i am considering emigrating to Europe, still not completely sure. I have German citizenship and lived there until i was 9 so i could just move over , but obviously it's not that simple and straightforward. And i could also just go over and claim welfare but i definitely don't want to do that, it should only be used for true emergencies. And i also am not naive and idolize Europe, I've spend a semester there and some time since moving and i know Europe has a bunch of issues as well obviously. And I'd miss my friends and family. Honestly if America just had a better social safety net and not such a heavy handed work culture where you have no protections and just live to work then I'd probably just want to stay in the Us because im jsut more comfortable and familiar with American culture obviously.  I have to say, this covid economic crisis makes Europe even more attractive provided it weathers this somewhat well, because i can't imagine what America would look like in a potential great depression. People don't have much if any soical safety nets and people are pretty desperate and on the edge. And inequality just keeps increasing, although Germany has off course a big inequality problem of it's own in, apperantly the biggest in Europe from what I've read. Its sad to see much of Europe americanising economically, maybe Europe will look like the Us eventually (economically i mean). I saw quite a lot of poverty in Germany, more than in most other European countries. Oh and actually identify politics is unfortunately another thing that seems to have been exported to Europe. If i do move over I'd probably do it by studying in Germany, but i want to improve my German first. Or i might just move to a different Eu nation. 

Well anyway I've done quite a bit of research, both on traditional skilled based immigration and illegal immigration and asylum seekers. It's hard to understand why Germany/the Eu would want to take in so many migrants/refugees who don't really want to integrate when you have so many skilled and hard working people all around the world who would do anything to be able to move to the Eu and would be very grateful for the opportunity. If the Eu wants immigration for economic reasons then why doesn't it target more culturally compatible nations and people who are more skilled. I don't think mass migration really helps anyone, i mean it certainly doesn't help the nations in Africa. And it doesn't help the working class people in Europe who have to compete for limited jobs and apartments. And i think it really just sparks racism and hate. I mean the left would have an easier time surviving if they didn't push mass migration of culturally incompatible people, obviously most people reject that and will want to vote for someone who will stop that. It seems like the most pro migration people are those with high incomes who don't really care about working class people and aren't really affected by low skill migration. It's a huge mess and its sad to see, because it divides people and it's just another thing that will make Europe more similar to America. I mean in Sweden now a lot of people who can afford it now move into suburbs because the inner cities have become violent and unpleasant, just like what happend in the Us. And why Americans become opposed to welfare and social policies. And the working class is left in the urban areas and then the wealthy left wonders why the working class becomes upset at all this. Its so frustrating, i don't see what's good about all this and how this is desirable. I don't think anyone really wants disorder and hate and instability and division and poverty and neoliberalism but i think that's what these migration policies are causing. And it turns people against community and social oriented policies. Like as Sweden has gotten more diverse it has also gotten more neoliberal and slowly dismantled many of its social policies that createated a strong safe comfortable middle class, the type of policies that have been praised around the world. I think the left has to realize that being socially left and wanting open borders will lead to the death of the welfare state, so they have to make a choice. And diversity on its own is off course not inherently a bad thing when done right, it's just bad when its done in the way Western Europe did it. When you masses of unskilled hostile culturally incompatible people then obviously there will be a backlash. But if you took skilled culturally compatible people from all over the world who would integrate then it works out, just like Canada. Like say just as an example why doesn't the Eu prefer skilled workers from say Asia and Latin America over illegal migrants, seems like a win win for both sides. At the end of the day it seems rational to adopt a skills based points system similar to Canada or New Zealand , i don't see why that's a right wing and intolerant idea.",,/r/europe/comments/gnzewq/uk_net_migration_from_outside_eu_hits_highest/frf5sjc/,CapablePace,1590124942

328,"In 2019, 15.9 million people aged over 15 were employed in the food supply sector in the EU, representing 8% of total employment. Their role is crucial for ensuring the essential needs of households, by keeping supermarket shelves as well as our plates full, during this period of corona crisis.

Almost half of people employed in the food supply sector worked in crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities (46%). Meanwhile, jobs in the manufacture of food products accounted for 26% of employment of this sector, followed by jobs in: retail sale of food, beverages and tobacco in specialised stores (15%), wholesale of food, beverages and tobacco (8%), manufacture of beverages (3%), wholesale of agricultural raw materials and live animals (2%) and fishing and aquaculture (1%). For the purpose of this news item, people employed in bars and restaurants are not included under food supply sector.

The majority of food supply workers were men (59%) although the gender distribution varied with the activities: fishing and aquaculture recorded 88% of men while retail sale of food, beverages and tobacco registered 63% of women. As regards the distribution by age groups, over one-third (38%) of people employed in the food supply sector in the EU were aged 35 to 49, while people aged 50 or above accounted for 34% and those aged 15-34 for 28%.

Among the EU Member States, Romania recorded the highest share of food supply workers (23%), followed by Greece (18%) and Poland (14%). By contrast, the lowest shares were recorded in Luxembourg and Sweden (both 3%), followed by Denmark (4%).

Germany is the only EU Member State where women were predominant in the food supply (52% of women and 48% of men) while Ireland recorded the highest share of men (78%), followed by Malta (72%) and Luxembourg (69%). In addition, only five EU Member States (Cyprus, Denmark, Malta, the Netherlands and Sweden) had their workers aged 15-34 dominating the food supply sector. Indeed, in a majority (16 out of 27) of the EU Member States, the largest shares of food supply workers were in the 35-49 age group, with the highest shares reported in Bulgaria, Czechia, Spain and Hungary (all 43%), while in six EU Member States (Germany, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Portugal and Slovenia), people aged 50 and above accounted for the largest share of food supply workers.

With the exception of Spanish region of Murcia (24%), the highest shares of food supply workers were generally recorded in regions of Greece, Poland and Romania:

* ten Greek regions: Western Greece (34%), Peloponnese (31%), East Macedonia, Thrace (28%), Continental Greece (27%), Thessaly (26%), West Macedonia (23%), North Aegean (23%), Crete (23%), Central Macedonia (22%) and Epirus (21%);
* four Polish regions: Podlaskie (26%), Lubelskie (26%), Mazowieckie-Regional (24%) and Świętokrzyskie (22%); and
* four Romanian regions: North-East (44%), South-West Oltenia (34%), South-East (24%) and South-Muntenia (23%).

If you are the council trying to put the cycle lane in, for the public consultation you get a room full of angry resident one rep from sustrans and one rep from a local cycling club. The residents ask ""where will I park my car otherwise"" and there is no good answer. So you get weak things like this that solve none of the problems and create new ones, but tick off policy bullet points and spend assigned budgets. 

We need vision and leadership and an actual plan, none of that is evident in the demagogues in power in the UK and US. 

I think many of us agree that as much as possible dense cities should be pedestrians, cyclists and mass public transport. Road traffic in and out should be vascular, and then boom; half of all carriageway can become cycleway. Doing that in London however would be so complicated it makes my head spin. 

So... How about a 5 year plan? Be clear that in 5 years you can no longer operate or store a private car within London.

Simply  [deny the elderly sick access to hospitals](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52704836) and [leave them to die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz5BhX5_CXo) (much like the sleazy trick that Cuomo played in NYC)?

388,"Estonia has some 200 soldiers out right now, which is not that significant. However they are spending 2% and taking part in every Nato op, which is very good politics. Great politics, not sure if it matters if the fighting starts. 

US sent kids to jungle to the otherside of the globe. It would fail everywhere, militia is for immediate homeland defense. 

The best info on the spending is the ""investment into weapons-maintenance-salaries-rents"" spread that NATO publishes. The 2% is a crap figure when it includes stuff like retirement spending. 

Estonia's real problem is low troop numbers and lack of airforce/anti air. You need a lot and Estonia is small. They are trying to build around the EDL militia, but progress is slow. They also lack 155 arty. 

If they could buy **Patriot AA**, 50k troops in 8 brigades, 78 pieces of 155 arty and about 100 IFVs it would look much better. 1 one mech brigade and 7 light brigades.  

Right now EDF has 165 120mm mortars, which could imply that they want to arm 9 brigades of infantry. 42 122mm arty and 24 155 fh70 -&gt; 4 brigades of mediocre artillery.

The late, inclement and cold time of the year, the almost complete absence of means of subsistence and the epidemic of typhus and smallpox raging among them made their situation desperate. And indeed, whose heart would be touched on seeing, for example, the already stiff corpse of a young Circassian woman lying in rags on the damp ground under the open sky with two infants, one struggling in his death-throes while the other sought to assuage his hunger at his dead mother's breast? And I saw not a few such scenes.

482,"Actually we are facing a new situation. The PM and the Mayor are heavily funding their propaganda, so much, that they are starting to target the foreign audience, especially the Albanians living abroad. Interestingly, this started last week, before they took down the theatre. A 15 year old boy was beaten and arrested by a group of cops for hanging out with his bicycle after the curfew which was at 15:00. 4 days later the curfew was set to 21:00. Then they did what they did and continued the violence against the peaceful protesters. We rarely have any kinds of violent protests, and never end up to riots, so it was quite shocking to see people covered in blood by the cops.
The PM of Kosovo spoke against the actions of our government, and I've seen many people from Kosovo raising their voice for us. It culminated while our idiot was interviewed by a channel in Kosovo through a videocall and one journalist started to ask him questions straighforwardly without holding back. 90% of the media in Albania is controlled by a group of people who have ties with the government, and it was one of the rarest moments to see our PM being attacked by a journalist in a live tv program. It was a moment of hope. 
Anyway, before the National Theatre was demolished, the Court ruled that the activists, other civillians and the  government should wait for the jury's call and settle down to find a common ground in the meantime. It noted that no actions should take place without a final decision by the Court. So the expectations are that the case will be managed by the Court, hopefully the PM and the Mayor get punnished for their illegal actions and maybe, if we get lucky, we will heavy early elections.

489,"Nice genocide denial and lying there with the courage of saying 'Circassians left voluntarily' while vast majority has been forcibly enforced out of their ancestral homelands if they were lucky enough to not being mass massacred or starved or intentionally put under siege for dying from diseases. Also nice that you pointed out Circassians attacking to Russian settlements within their territories and ancestral homeland, decades after the start of Russo-Circassian War as something triggered the war itself, and some stupid claim that the genocide has a connection to Turkish media while the only connection is about there is being millions of ethnic Circassians in Turkey given Russia death marched them. 

Also, heck, chopping heads on putting them on poles were done by the Russian Army in a large scale. Acting like if it was done by Circassians is some new low.

Circassians were not an Ottoman vassal either, lmao. And suggesting Circassians were offered to have fertile lands in Kuban... On the paper, Circassians were given the choice between being forcibly death marched to be resettled at the other side of the Kuban where diseases were vast spread and land was swampy, and under the control of Cossacks or getting deported to Ottoman lands. Of course they have not chosen it. Many also haven't been given the choice in practice but forced out to death marches. It is also disgusting that you're trying to shift the blame from Russian Empire to the other empires. Ottomans had a secondary role in genocide, with them encouraging some nobles and their ships and the incompetence, but other than that, of course blame goes to the empire that had genocided them and cleansed them. 

And no, Russo-Circassian War and genocide was one sided as Circassians defended their homeland and Russia invaded them. Of course invader settlements get attacked by Circassians, lol. True that Russia also used rivalry between Circassian tribes only to attack those tribes after, and at the end uniting Circassians against the common enemy, the invading Russian Empire.

Quality of enforcement varies, as does the need for enforcement. I know established routes where nobody parks over them. Some places do a better job than this example though, and physically separate bike lanes can more effectively prevent car access.

We know we can do it because we already have in a number of countries and cities, though not enough. This example seems to be a recent coronaviris quick-fix though, actual planned routes are better than this example. I also imagine that people probably parked in those same spaces just a few weeks ago and just haven't adapted, though I may be wrong if it isn't new.

We also know we can do it because it has also had huge benefits when planned and implemented properly. Turning more space over to bike lanes has resulted in less congestion, faster travel times, and better health for our citizens. All benefit the economy directly and/or indirectly. The majority of daily trips in most cities use non-car modes, in part because they are more efficient. Car ownership is lower in our cities than rural areas and suburbs, many choose no car out of preference.

With regards to efficiency, when a whole lane is turned over to bikes instead of cars, capacity is approximately 7 times higher (measured in people per hour) of 14,000 cycling rather than only 2,000 in cars. In dense cities the number of people we can shift per hour is very important.

English language source on bike/car lane capacity fyi: https://www.cycling-embassy.org.uk/dictionary/capacity

Our bike lanes can seem at first glance to be far less utilised than car lanes, but that is largely because the much higher capacity of bike lanes results in very little congestion compared to car lanes, if you take a quick look for a second or two, you see less bikes during most of the day because cyclists don't have to queue for the majority of their journey time like cars do in big cities. This is even the case in places where very high levels of people cycle, you need a LOT of cyclists to create a system as gridlocked and inefficient as car roads.",,/r/europe/comments/gntrrz/berlin_wants_to_improve_the_situation_with/frenbwi/,FCPTAN,1590112633

543,"&gt;You obviously know that Greece has every legal right to extend its territorial waters to 12NM, like every other nation in the world (like Turkey does in the black sea) but doesn't do so as a sign of good faith (and practical reasons among others) since you get so butthurt about it and even threaten with war, so spare me the lecture about who's abusing who's rights. 

Extending it to 12NM means, as stated earlier the article, an abuse of right as Turkey will lose some rights it has now. So Greece needs to go to negotiation table. Turkey (but also any other country) has the right to threaten with war if they think there rights are in danger. International examples show that Greek claim is the odd one.

&gt;Btw it was you who rushed to announce the BS EEZ with Libya, 

Rushed? This was going to happen in 2010, but Qadhafi got killed and put on hold.

&gt;Greece hasn't officially anounced its EEZ 

Can you provide me a link so I can research it?

&gt;But turkish police shooting over the Greek side was OK with you I guess. Well, I can't blame you, cause it's obvious that your state controlled media will never reveal if something your government said was fake news

Where did I implied that this was OK? I rarely watch state media. I consume a lot of different media, including Greek newspapers. So I can see every point of view.

&gt;I bet you still believe that Israel is ready to form an EEZ with Turkey.

Yes, maybe they will. Unlike Egypt, Israel is a smart country who operates carefully about its national interests. Israel know that Turkey is vital for peace in Israel and the region. Greece has no significant strategic importance for Israel. That's why Israel always kept Greece and Cyprus at a distant when Turkey-Israel relations were good. Israel will drop Greece and Cyprus immediately if it would bring back Turkey.

I can see in the little things that Israel wants this EEZ deal. Like how Israel send a letter to the drilling ships right after the Turkish-Libya deal. The talks are happening in the background, so until something solid comes out, both countries will deny working on it on the foreground. Turkey wants it when Netanyahu is gone.

 In May 2019 several members of the Grup Yorum began a hunger strike  in protest to the treatment the band received from the Turkish Government.

Honestly, I do believe that in this day and age low-skilled immigrants are a damage to a country's economy, but to go hate this much on desperate people who are fleeing their homeland without knowing the language of the country they're headed to, without any money saved and by taking a journey through the sea with a relatively high risk of death, is insane. Even if not all of these people are escaping from war, don't you realize that they still have it extremely hard, much more than any of us could ever conceive? Just think of the journey through the mediterannean sea they have to make in order to reach europe. Would you ever do that just to earn a higher wage? I don't think so, and we all know this. Quoting some top comments from here:

&gt; They’re economic migrants not refugees. And if you’re an economic migrant you should go through the legal process, not pretend to be a refugee to cut the cue.

&gt; ""These dreamseekers should go back""

What the hell, guys. Are you really this naive? No, you aren't. You just need excuses to justify your egoism. Because so are we humans. First we decide what to believe in, then we make up stories to validate our beliefs and only listen to those who say what we want to be said. This unfortunately is not the reality we live in.

The reality is much sadder. I'd rather the immigration stops, but that isn't going to happen, unfortunately. So we should just accept it and move on to formulate a common european plan to respond to the migratory crisis. If migrants were redistributed across all of the EU, it would become a non-issue and populist far-right leaders wouldn't haven risen as much as they have in countries hit the hardest by migration. The EU population is 445 millions, we can easily absorb the migrants. Neither Malta nor Italy can on their own - nor should they. The EU's inactivity on this issue is criminal. It's all the EU countries other than Malta, Italy, Spain and Greece that are exploiting the laws, not the migrants. The Dublin Treaty is a law made in a diferent time and is not suitable to face the migratory crisis; it should be modified asap.",,/r/europe/comments/gnsl6i/we_give_you_30_minutes_malta_turns_migrant_boat/fre7ih0/,clodi95,1590103410

This plan intends to give money away for free, hoping that it is spent on projects that allow the economy to recover. In the best case scenario it works and the economic losses caused through this crisis get mitigated. The net recieving countries of those financial aids would gain and a small portion of those gains would be recovered by the net paying countries through their export orientated economies. If it really helps the economy to recover it would be a economic gain for Europe as a whole, it would be a gain for the net recieving countries (mostly southern Europe) and it would still be a massive loss for the net paying countries and their tax payers. 

And if it doesn't have the promised effects of a massive economic recovery or if the recovery caused by it is only short term, not only the money would be wasted, the Southern European countries would simply demand more free money for their largely uncompetitive economies.

Turkey's claim is literally that Cyprus, Crete, Rhodes and other islands do not generate ANY EEZ and they are only entitled to territorial waters.

Only in regards to Kastelorizo you can claim Greece is overextending though (valid under UNCLOS but admittedly unfair to Turkey) . In regards to Cyprus, Crete and Rhodes Turkey is blatantly wrong. Even the cases you have shared clearly support that. For example, Libya-Malta. Malta got 20% reduction over the median line because ICJ judged that they should give Libya a bonus due to its much larger coastline in the area. If you take that case and compare it to Cyprus-Turkey or Crete-Turkey then it is obvious that Turkey will get at the very best a 20% bonus over the median line not an 100% as they claim.

704,"With the permission of /u/haveyougoogle, I'm gonna post his old and short abstract explaining the day, on how a fellow North Caucasian nation had suffered even though so far no state, but Georgia, recognises it. So these are not my words, but a copy-pasta of his/hers.

In 2 June 1864 (21 May 1864 by then Russian calendar), Russian Tsar Aleksandr II declared that the Russo-Circassian War, a series of war that started in 1763 - and lasted approximately 101 years and which was part of the Russian Empire's Caucasus conquest, had ended, and of course the occupation of Circassian land by Russian Empire. By quoting Walter Richmonds, in his description of the final conquest and expulsion of the Circassians in the 1860s, Russian officer Ivan Drozdov says this about the death and destruction that his army brought upon Circassians: “Mankind has rarely experienced such disasters and to such extremes, but only horror could have an effect on the hostile mountaineers and drive them from the impenetrable mountain thickets.""

You highly probably haven't even heard of Circassia or a nation called Circassians, aside from them living in Europe or where they were and are living, and that's mostly because of the war and the consequences of the war for the once largest nation of North Caucasus, and one of the oldest national groups of Europe. Nation itself was actually pretty famous, from being the subject of the famous travellers and adventure books to being at the frontpages of the American newspapers, or being pointed by the Karl Marx, or from the fantasies of some Western painters about the pale white sex slaves to some pseudo-racist early anthropological classifications where the term Caucasian is still a reminder of: but just in a glimpse of a century, it turned into some unknown word excluding maybe at some paintings about the Ottoman harems and a type of wood, just as the country was destroyed and the population was decimated, and turned into some small isles in the very ancestral homeland or some national groups of other countries.

At the end of the war, victorious Russia approved Dmitry Milyutin's plan which was about ""not to simply move them so that their land could be settled by productive farmers, but rather that 'eliminating the Circassians was to be an end in itself - to cleanse the land of hostile elements'"". Milyutin became the War Minister then, and seen his plan being implemented. The practice was also about what the general field marshal Aleksandr Bariatinskii was saying, especially after the 1830-1840 period: “We must assume that we will need to exterminate the mountaineers before they agree to our demands”.

Whole Circassian population in the historical Circassia was lowered to %5 of what it was by the early 1860s (also it should be noted that, even before the adaption of the Milyutin's plans in Kabarda/Eastern Circassia the population in 1790 which was around 300000 was dropped to 30000 just in 40 years), while during the 101 years long war which Circassians fought against the odds, many were murdered, whole villages were burned and destroyed, corps were destroyed and livestock were killed in order to starve the natives, and regions were surrounded in order to diseases like the plague to kill them all until to point that Russian forces can go in and finish the job (especially in the Kabarda/Eastern Circassia). Only between 1860-1865 at least 625 000 Circassians end up dead, according to both Epifantsev who is with a pro-Russian stance and describes the events as a great crime and inhumane but another chapter of imperial expansionism only, and Richmond who describes events as a genocide. Brutality of the Tsarist commanders were well-known, especially the general Aleksei Ermolov's, while aside from tactics including starving people or annihilating settlements, some figures like General Grigorii Zass furthered things to the point of harvesting Circassian heads and ""the heads of Circassians were constantly stuck on lances on a specially made hill at Prochny Okop, and their beards blew in the wind."" At the end, Circassians were given the choice between resettling to the other side of the river under the Cossack control where they would highly probably die off from the diseases, and left for the Ottoman Empire, while in practice only given option was to leave North Caucasus for the Ottoman Empire (and Iran) and all were driven to the shores of the Black Sea. While hundreds of thousands were forcibly deported, many died before making to the shores and while waiting for the ships where they were forced to shores without food or water by the Imperial Russian forces, and some were even left to the open land without clothing. With the ships arrived, overcrowded ships became tombs for the Circassian who were able to make to them, and a huge portion perished in the Black Sea. Things weren't good for the ones who made to the shores either, where a sizable amount of the survivors died in the places they landed. For example, a diplomat in Trabzon during the period writes ""so far 19000 of the 24700 people who landed to Trabzon has died. 200 of the 110000 refugees around the Samsun region are dying on the daily basis"". While numbers depends on the source, according to many, between 2 to 2.5 millions of Caucasian Mountaineers were expelled, while only around 1.5 million of them made to the shores, and only less than a million of them managed to survive. In 1879, the New York Times called the Circassians “a Murdered Nation”.

Although the Circassians (and Ubykhs who were included in Circassians) and also Abkhazians and Abazas were the main victims, the expulsions also deeply affected other peoples in the Caucasus region. It was estimated that 80% of the Ingush left Ingushetia for the Middle East in 1865. Lowland Chechens as well were evicted in large numbers. The Arshtins were completely wiped out and became a little clan within the neighbouring Chechen nation. Also, small numbers of Muslim Ossetians and Lezgins were expelled as well.

Today 90% of people with Circassian descendent now live in other countries rather than their homeland. The depopulated Circassian lands were resettled by various ethnic groups, including Russians, Ukrainians and so on.

In 1990, the Circassians designated the 21st of May as the national Day of Mourning, as the anniversary of the Circassian genocide and exile committed as a part of the colonialist policies of the Tsarist Russia. Former Russian President Boris Yeltsin's May 1994 statement admitted that North Caucasian resistance to the tsarist forces was legitimate, but the current appeal notes that he did not recognize ""the guilt of the tsarist government for the genocide committed against the peoples of the North Caucasus"". Personally, like the vast majority of my nation, while I do count the events as a genocide, and while many Russians do say it was only a war crime, ethnic cleansing, imperial expansion or ""Americans did the same to the Native Americans and they say it isn't a genocide either"", I don't think the terminology is going to differ what has happened at the end. And let me remind that, current Russians are unrelated to these events, Russian Federation is also not responsible nor the legal successor of the Russian Empire. While of course there are some demands, which are about recognition of the crime, restoration of Circassia instead of the ongoing policy of dividing Circassians into some even non-existing subgroups and the shared-republic policies, and the right to repatriate to our ancestral and historical homeland (especially for the ones in the warzones, like Syrian Circassians), there isn't anybody holding current Russia responsible for anything.

For many times, heads of current Circassian Republics under Russian Federation, requested Duma to reconsider the situation request for and apology. But to date, there has been further moves from Russian Federation other than Sochi Olympics at year, also the 150th anniversary of genocide and exile, in the very city, where Circassians had surrendered in 1864. I really don't know why, Russia also chosen to hold skiing and related events and build the core of the Olympic infrastructure in Krasnaya Polyana, which was ""once known as Qbaada"" and ""settled by Russian immigrants and renamed Krasnaya Polyana (Red Meadow), a reference to all the blood spilled on the field during the final battle"". Sure that this wasn't ""cool"" at least, especially while there wasn't any mention of Circassians in the opening or the ending ceremony but more importantly, while Syrian Circassians were not able repatriate to their historical homeland from the brutal warzones.

737,"&gt;Dude, you need to prove that. UK and USA were unwilling to push the topic? So whatever you think is real, that only real. Podgorica assembly happened, most of the politicians and people were for the unification. Treaty of Versailles happened were everything was confirmed and nobody protested. You can believe in whatever you want it to believe to suit your nationalistic agenda, but it does not mean its true.

I have provided sources for that, for both the USA and UK. You're welcome to read them. Using the politicians as proof of the state of things is funny at best, considering whose army picked them and whose army encircled the building they were voting in in an effort to ""quicken"" their decision making. Also interesting how you're crying ""agenda"" while ironically giving no source to back your claims.


&gt;Nope, you are just using this to help your agenda, playing with numbers, looking for anything just to fit in your worldview. As I said, most of the rebel leaders later joined Karadjodjevic dynasty institutions, army etc. Not really in line with your terror on civilian population. ""The Greens"" were also pro Serbian group who also wanted unification but on other terms. So what about that... Christmas uprising is used almost as a myth among Montenegrin nationalists minds to power hatred between Serbs and Montenegrins in Montenegro. They are trying to overblow everything about that.

You're welcome to provide proof denying anything I've presented. I sourced my claims, from both my side,an international one and one from serbia. You're free to ignore them of course. And yes,some rebels later joined serbia, some of the surviving ones that is. How does this prove anything related to the number of rebels,the fighting, killing etc? Because they joined the winning side, it automatically means no terror was done. Tell that to the Zvicers. The Greens wanted to enter Yugoslavia with Montenegro as an equal member,not serbia's province, which btw you said 100% of people supported the assembly. 

&gt;Christmas uprising is used almost as a myth among Montenegrin nationalists minds to power hatred between Serbs and Montenegrins in Montenegro. They are trying to overblow everything about that.

And Podgorica Assembly happened because people wanted it, why would they do it if a few days later they gonna unite into Yugoslavia no matter what? Because people wanted it for hundred of years, it was a symbolic gesture of national unification.

It was a part of Serbia, and this influenced the way Montenegro entered Yugoslavia which is why a rebellion happened. If the people wanted, as you claim without source, then why did the army have to encircle the assembled voters to ""ensure"" they get it done quicker?

We've been talking about the entire world speaking Chinese for quite a while now, but I haven't seen any materialization of it. It's the Chinese who are learning English.

As for Russian, well, you need a big country to push for it, and Russia seems to be losing influence and that will probably continue to be the case in the future.

Arabic... maybe if the EU gets  absolutely fill with Arabic speaking immigrants... But it doesn't seem to be a culture that attracts people all that much, and none of the Arabic speaking countries seem to be influential enough, either.

821,"I would be very skeptical of these stories. I've read similar stories for years in the context of developing countries, how China was going to vacate manufacturing as it moved up the value chain and basically ""give away"" hundreds of billions of USD for the third world. Didn't happen. Aside from a very select few lucky standouts (Vietnam, Bangladesh, to some extent Ethiopia), who got some textile and low-end manufacturing, the rest didn't get much if anything.

Much of what China manufactures now is increasingly up-market. Medical equipment, industrial machinery etc. Tim Cook, when asked why he didn't relocate more of his factories to the US said that aside from the fact that wages are several times higher in the West, China has hundreds of millions of highly skilled manufacturing workers. You just can't beat that as an aggregate. 

All I'm saying is, temper your enthusiasim on these stories. There might be some very strategic products coming home for national security reasons, but China isn't going to stop being an industrial powerhouse just as Germany isn't going to stop being one.

When it's just a blue strip of paint experienced cyclists tend not to use them as it provides no protection and is less safe than taking the lane to prevent dangerous overtaking in a tight area, and you are less visible to turning vehicle traffic. Also I don't think the blue strips of paint are taking away the space you are talking about.

897,"&gt;In my opinion, the Greek economy has a ""bit more issues"" because of troika program.

And in my opinion they have issues due to a massive debt they have with no realistic way to pay it back with or without austerity.

&gt;The austerity program ... [is] about paying debt

&gt;... whereas Portuguese debt is projected to decrease 1% from 2017 (was 126.0% of GDP in 2017).

So let me get this straight. You think that troika wants austerity to pay back debts but you also think that without austerity a country can pay back their debts better? I guess troika are just group of dum-dums.

Seriously, how am I supposed to comment anything in any realistic sense about this when you're basically claiming that all economical differences between Greece and Portugal are caused by austerity?

However, no one outside of bikers seems to be aware of this fact so people bitch and make faces despite it being the letter of the law. Also, the drivers outside of main roads tend to be so passive, it gets really stupid. I've lost count of the number of times a car has yielded to me, sometimes dangerously, when I'm stopped at a sign and they have clear right of way. It's even dangerous for me since I can't see behind them, so if another car decides to hit the gas and go around I'm fucked (I bike often enough that I've seen this exact scenario play out). I also have to stubbornly wait at 4-way stops sometimes when I'm the last to arrive, while everyone stares at me thinking they're doing me favors but in reality it's mildly dangerous to assume that 3 out of 3 drivers are all breaking convention (and possibly law) to let me go first. If someone isn't watching me and figures it's their turn, then guns it for whatever reason, I'm looking at bruises and bike damage.

But yeah, my city is generally an exception to how things usually go.

Several times when we were out walking it would come to be time to cross the street. It seemed like almost every time, there would be a car very far away who would see us crossing. Before we started crossing, the car would be driving normally. But it always seemed like once any of us set one foot in the street to cross, cars would actually speed up when they saw us and they would start aggressively honking in some cases.

I’m not gonna say we “never” jaywalked but if we did it was always after a long careful look to be sure we weren’t interrupting traffic. But a car would see from at least a block and a half away and seem to speed up to try and “get” us. This behavior was also seen crossing normally at crosswalks too.

Is that a thing in Berlin? Why do they do that? We have awful drivers here but even they generally never threaten people with their cars in they way we saw in Berlin.

About our group: we just white people so I don’t think it was a racist thing. We also from SF so we didn’t look obviously American (not obese and no white socks or anything like lol) or obviously non-German.

Everyone is shitty. There's a link from a week or so ago over on /r/fahrrad quoting a study in, I believe Germany, that over 95% of all citizens asked (pedestrians, cyclists and motorists) said they regularly break the law.

Just today as I was going out on a ride, I almost got hit by a car cutting me off during a turn into a bike lane as I was leaving the regular road. This week I did a bunch of cycling in the center of Vienna and counted several cars, bikes and pedestrians not following various rules (almost hit a ped because of their flagrant disregard for the rules).

Everyone is bad. The police need to enforce lights on bikes at night (almost hit a few bikes while on my own bike because of this). The police need to be better about enforcing speeding of cars.

First having common sense doesn't mean you are ancap. Maybe a bit of the opposite when large scale security concerns are included.

Second stopping taxes doesn't automatically mean dissolution of the state. Army functions and civil judicial functions for example. You can have the government operate off the markets for financing the functions, much like Norways investment fund. Or natural resources. Or tax system with full options on what you want to be part of financing.

Third assuming government is required for the day to day protection of property. Frankly european governments have made almost all self protection illegal.

And absolutely, making things less convenient for cars is essential to that. Less parking, less right-of-way and reduced speeds all make car use less appealing than the alternatives. However you still need to provide those alternatives. 

Obviously you've got a whole range of alternatives but they all have advantages and drawbacks. The big advantage of cycling is it's incredibly space-efficient, you won't get more travellers per square meter by any other method but walking. And the main blocker for people cycling is usually a fear of being on the road with cars. Segregated bike tracks are consistently the best way to get more people riding, and as long as you take the space away from cars, you achieve both goals of making cycling more appealing and making cars less appealing.

It's not different roads for everyone, it's just dividing up the road we have in a more efficient way, without detracting from pedestrians.",,/r/europe/comments/gntrrz/berlin_wants_to_improve_the_situation_with/frc8h2i/,callsignhotdog,1590067110

The EU is of course free to threat the UK as they sees fit.

Some people are afraid that the gay community, considers themselves better-than and giving them more power (or even recognition) is like giving billionaires - tax-breaks.

Some people are just trying to fit-in and refuse to have an opinion, just side with the biggest group.

Some people are ""religious"" and for them this issue is a way to prove how ""devoted"" they are, even though they don't practice their religion. Sort of, redemption through hate.

Some people have never met an open gay person and fallback to propaganda and prejudice to formulate an opinion.

The reason why i say this, is not that the LGBT community should change itself or anything of this sort. Rather, perception is everything.

Change is slow, especially when it comes to social norms. One of the most successful voices (as depressing as it sounds) for the LGBT community has been ""Will and Grace"". The reason is simple - familiarity. The sitcom was simple and similar to others at the time, but it was featuring a gay person as part of the main cast. It was full of stereotypes and there was nothing progressive about it, but it acted as a common ground. Point of reference.

Time, of course will change all of that, but until then people will have to live in a society, who is afraid of them without even understanding them.

&gt;No, I'm just calling a holocausts denying white supremacist a nazi.

None of these comics are holocaust denying or nazilike though. The first one is mocking people who believe in some conspiracy theories while writing others off. Pretty standard.

The second one  is about how society and media constantly tell you to be open minded and question everything but only as long as ""everything"" is within a pre-approved box of ideas that have already deemed acceptable for you to question beforehand. In order for the joke to work it has to something as shocking and offensive as holocaust questioning.

The third one is just a sequence of mockery of everyone's sensitivies. Atheist mocks christians by placing bibles in the fiction category, magahats do the same with atheists who mock christianity and mock islam which are in turn mocked in the same manner as the previous two groups.

Unless you think placing a quran in the fiction section in islamophobia and placing a bible in the fiction category is anti christian I don't see why you think this is antisemitic.

1359,"If you are truly OK with the idea of living in a world where you can't legitimise your relationship to the woman you love while men who love men everywhere are free to do so in your society, OK. If you think you have equal rights to the gay men in that world, fine. I would implore you to question if you would legitimately feel this way if this was the world you lived in for your entire life, and not just for five seconds while in reality knowing that you can go back to the comfortable world of having this right while others don't any time you wish. I do not in any case believe that the majority of straight people in that world would share the opinion you claim to hold - after all, the majority of gay people do not see the opposite situation in this way, and straight people in favour of same-sex marriage share that view.

As I said in my first response to you, every person in Poland has a right to marry someone of the opposite sex. A lot of people don't have the right to marry *the person they love*. Does the law look discriminatory out of context? No, but it has drastically different effects based on different groups of people and that *is* discriminatory because different groups sometimes need different legal rights to possess the same experiential rights.

Think for example if there was a law saying ""All people have the right not to be sexually assaulted by straight men"". This would technically not discriminate between who is protected at all - all of us are protected from the same thing. But that thing is only threatening to half of society, and the other half of society need protection from something else entirely if they're to get the same effect from the law. So in reality while the law does discriminate even though it claims to be egalitarian.

I actually don't really have a problem with you opposing gay marriage on most grounds. I think it's healthy for society and in almost twenty years of it being a thing, I see no negative effects in any of its early adopters. The Netherlands even has better demographics by far than like, every European country that doesn't allow it. But I understand that you feel differently on the effect it would have on society, and maybe you have some data that shows negative impacts in places which have legalised it. However, I would really appreciate you seeing that at least in some circumstances, a law that applies the same way to everyone can be discriminatory based on the qualities of those people.

2. The problem is not the Italian government. Projects in Germany, if there are enough of them will also see significant waste and the same for every country. I am not concerned about waste because it is Italy, I am concerned about waste because there are simply no ways to identify 500bn worth of good projects in such a short amount of time.

As for the  discrimination against straight white man; it's something I've heard one transgender say (had the absolute pleasure of sharing a house with him and 30 other students from across the globe during my 6-month exchange in Tokyo) while I've seen a Lesbian write something about being afraid of straight white men because we might want to force them down and you never know when we might strike. It's some weird racism that seems to originate from the US where some people decided that being racist against white people isn't racism and being sexist against man isn't sexism for some fucking reason. So this British Transgender thought this was completely logical and occasionally I would hear stuff like ""CIS white men are all ugly and gross!"" from the other side of the kitchen. I managed to hold back for about a week, knowing that if I'd casually start throwing similar comments about Trans people, hell would be break loose. But after that week I couldn't hold back anymore and that feud kept going for the full 6 months until I arrived back in the Netherlands. I got along fine with some exchange students who happened to be gay as well, and they took no issue with me sometimes showing a less-progressive side to the Transgender. So most of my exchange was getting shitfaced with either British or Japanese people and feuding with the bitchy transgender.

And I'm happy my country's example is being followed by countries such as Australia and am glad to hear you're having a good life. but I can't really claim personal involvement as I'm not old enough to have been involved in the legalising of gay marriage as I was 7 when it happened. Even if you later might decide not to get married, it must at least feel better to have the option available to you, an option straight Australians have enjoyed ages before they gave you the right.

Also, downing alcohol with the lads is great, I made a mate (straight) uncomfortable once when I asked the gays what kind of guys they were into (as the others were talking about which kind of girls they're into and I didn't want them to feel left out and I thought it'd be funny to make it awkward for some people). Unfortunately most went ome to their parents since uni is closed due to COVID-19. The only remaining one other than myself decided on cheaper student accommodation located just across the border in Belgium, and the idiot's been stuck there since Belgium closed its border because of COVID-19 2.5 months ago.

Japan completely defeated Russia's navy and army, it wasn't even close. It was a Massive humiliation to Russia. I even remember in history class that it was notated just how devastating and humiliating the defeat was and that the Tzar lost a lot of legitimacy. The Tzar even faced some small revolts as a result due to the complete defeat of Russias armed forces while the economy was tumbling and peasants where struggling to survive, a precursor to the 1917 October revolution. Japan was massively industrialized by then and already started industrialization in 1868,the same time as many other European nations, and they did so at a rapid pace. Russia on the other hand still severely lacked and was behind in industrialization and didn't completely industrialize until ww2. It was just a shock because the West wasn't aware how industrialized Japan really was and that they had already build up a formidable navy.

And how was Japan a 3rd world state prior to ww2? It was a wealthy,technological, developed state. They had a Miltiary industrial Complex and had some pretty impressive military tech. Just look at the Yamato. If Japan was a 3rd world nation they wouldn't have been able to fight a war with almost all of Asia, America and the British Empire and even win in the beginning and hold out for several years. Their main problem was a lack of natrual resources and oil in particular , the same problem Nazi Germany had. Crazy how some Oil could have completely changed the tide of the war. And just like Germany, while the American aid helped, what also really helped was prior Industrial knowledge/education and leftover equipment and skilled workers.

1. All those words were part of political discourse, so yes it's normal that during medieval times Slavic versions of those words to enter use.
2. Voce was certainly in use before modern times, and neither acvila nor pajura are used commonly today to designate the actual bird (vultur is the preferred word, even though they are not perfectly synonymous).
3. I see a lot of claims from foreigners about Latin origin words that were supposedly not used before 18th century in Romanian, yet they clearly appear in written literature. For instance the word ""popor"" (from Latin populus) supposedly was introduced in Romanian by 19th century nationalists. Nothing further from the truth.

1726,"&gt;Human Coronavirus Types


&gt;Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. There are four main sub-groupings of coronaviruses, known as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta.

&gt;Human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s. The seven coronaviruses that can infect people are:

&gt;- 229E (alpha coronavirus)

&gt;- NL63 (alpha coronavirus)

&gt;- OC43 (beta coronavirus)

&gt;- HKU1 (beta coronavirus)

&gt;Other human coronaviruses

&gt;- MERS-CoV (the beta coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS)

&gt;- SARS-CoV (the beta coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS)

&gt;- SARS-CoV-2 (the novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19)

&gt;People around the world commonly get infected with human coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1.

&gt;Sometimes coronaviruses that infect animals can evolve and make people sick and become a new human coronavirus. Three recent examples of this are 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV.",,/r/europe/comments/gnk3ru/swedish_antibody_study_shows_little_sign_of_herd/fraqvfq/,mynameisneddy,1590024478

Propaganda is done for instance through the nazi party LSNS, as well as till now rulling party SMER which are both creating this boogieman in the form of LGBTI and playing on the conservatism and fear of the majority of the population. But these are not the only one; any political or non-political party with (seemingly) conservative orientation tries to score points and sway the vox populi their way. 

Closely connected is victimization which is again used as a sort of a tool to create this dreadful image of the future, where the ""oppressed"" majority will be suffering under the rule of the LGBTI. 

In my view, the core of the problem lies in almost criminal level of ignorance as well as extremely strong belief in conservatism, which regards even small changes to status quo as socially harmful and it is this fear of change that is preyed on by many in politics and outside of it.",Na Kráľovej Holi,/r/europe/comments/gnj4zq/where_people_are_against_gay_rights_in_the_eu/fraqzye/,Chaotic_Stardust,1590024548

&gt; If it says anything less than 95% European, you are not white 

That's the problem this sounds like what Hitler would said, there is no such thing as ""white"", because it all depends on WHAT you referring as ""white"" because if you are trying to refer the ""European"" descendants as ""white"" well why not you just call them ""European"" than ? Or if you are referring to pigmentation, skin and hair tone/color etc. like I said there are even Arabs who happens to be ""white"" WITHOUT having European ancestry.

I mean calling ""Europeans"" ""white"" and putting them all in one basket also doesn't make sense as well, because there are Slavs, Germanics, Italians, Greeks, Iberians etc.etc. Ancient Greeks where now Europeans base their ""European"" identity were brown. Or Germanics who are seen totally ""European"" now were seen as ""outsiders"", ""barbarians"" by Romans who happens to be the starting point of this ""European"" identity, same Germanics now rules the EU/Europe ? 

Longs story short, ""Europeans"" themselves have totally different genetic make up between themselves, same goes for culture as well an Italian have much more in common with Lebanese or Tunisian or Algerian than Scandinavian but Swedish and Italian they are both ""Europeans"" right ?

I twiched a bit reading this.

I honestly don't know what China commited to during the COP21, nor where she now stands in that regard, but it seems to me that none of the parties made any significant progress toward attaining the Paris objectives, no more that with the 20 previous COP, nor the 4 henceforth.

Actually, since the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, itself supposed to enforce the *United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change* of 1992, global emissions have kept rising, in no small part due to the rapid industrialization of China and the international trade agreements that supported it.

So, if a new world order is to emerge from the pandemic, the first item on the agenda should be to completely re-engineer this convention and those agreements.

Seeing that the author was herself a key player of the COP21, and therefore of the sustained and consistent failure of all attempts to mitigate climate change, I'll certainly won't trust her with this hypothetical new world order.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/gnjdlv/a_truly_multilateral_order_can_emerge_from_the/fradn6l/,Neker,1590017071

&gt;In this case all ""activists and journalists"" want is for trans people to be treated as the gender they claim to be in official documents.

and the solution I offered makes this not necessary or a problem.. If they see ""sex"" but not ""gender"" why would they feel upset/suicidal? Why would their dysphoria act up upon seeing that? If it's really about gender, then surely reasonable transgenders would have no issue facing the reality of their biological sex.

&gt;That's all, nothing more. Put the women's sports strawman away, that's not what this is about, nor are they even topics of contention in Hungary.

If the government is going out of their way to change things like what's on an ID, then they're probably trying to avoid the scenarios I mentioned that playing out around the world, from happening within Hungary.

Now I'm going to actually stop responding this time because you're being willfully ignorant and obtuse. Again, no issue with transgender people, dress and act as you like in accordance to what you believe your gender to be, but when the movements start to promote the things they do in my country, then I can understand why some other country's have an aversion to entertaining their arguments.. Clear up the image of your movement, and deradicalize your radical activists online, then re-approach this discussion like adults instead of emotional children, and stop assuming that transgenders need to have text on their ID to prevent the world from exploding.

1899,"Homes are included in the statistics and I see no reason why they couldn't for example mortgage their houses if they have no other means to pay for a tax on wealth. After all the main reason why they could accumulate a much higher house owner rate compared to German citizens are the lower taxes and dues that they had to pay over the past decades. 

In Germany many people simply can't afford their own house due to the insane prices for buying or building a house which are caused by 

 \- high taxes 

 \- high demand, partly due to immigration and partly due to cheap credits (the EZB mainly caused those) 

 \- high procuration fees

Another reason why many can't afford their own house are that many peoples income is too low due to high income taxes and dues and low wage increases despite almost 2 decades of economic prosperity. We also have - as far as I am aware - the biggest low-wage sector in the EU. Those people will never be able to afford their own home yet you expect them to pay for other countries on top of what they already have to pay. 

As for your doctor example: Healthcare workers in Germany are also quite under payed and I sure hope that every single European country and their citizens  change their mindset after this whole pandemic is over and start paying them adequately. Or why wait, they could start doing that right now.

1928,"&gt;Didn't know it was an outlandish idea to suggest a country doesn't have a useful reason to accommodate something so functionally useless

You mean sex in an ID? Yeah, I don't know why it's there in the first place anyway. It's like having religion in there.

&gt;If Orban is literally Hitla 2.0 like some people on this subreddit could lead you to believe, certainly he's doing this to eradicate and erase transgender people!!! 

That is literally what you said he's doing...

&gt;If they see ""sex"" but not ""gender"" why would they feel upset/suicidal? Why would their dysphoria act up upon seeing that? If it's really about gender, then surely reasonable transgenders would have no issue facing the reality of their biological sex.

Because they would *like* to change their sex, too, obviously, and they don't need the daily reminder that they're unable. Do you think it'd be nice for, say, an epileptic's ID to say ""spastic"" in it, or would it be better if they could live their lives as normally as possible when their differences are not relevant? And that, of course, is ignoring the massive elephant in the room that is the discrimination that this *will* cause, because even if the transgender person doesn't care about the discrepancy, the person they hand the ID to *will*.

But anyway, does it even matter why? You clearly don't care how they feel, you won't give a shit if they tell you it does matter, you're just grasping at straws trying to disguise your uncaring, self-centered, callous indifference as mere objectivity... Just say you hate them outright and you wish they'd all be dead and stop wasting your time and mine with this song-and-dance routine.

And when you have a transgender child or grandchild you'll change your tune like everyone always does.

&gt;If the government is going out of their way to change things like what's on an ID, then they're probably trying to avoid the scenarios I mentioned that playing out around the world, from happening within Hungary. 

Or they're just playing to their stupid, borderline-illiterate base, who lap this up as some sort of amazing fuck-you to the evil foreign ~~jews~~ liberals and Soros who they've been taught to hate over the past decade. Oh and the EU, don't forget the EU.

If you think Orbán has any other agenda besides making himself and his cronies stupidly rich I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.

---

And since you decided for some reason to split the thread in two, part deux:

&gt;Ignoring your mockery, It probably started with the idea that gender is a meaningful concept that is necessary to be distinct from sex in government documentation (you know, what were talking about).

So you're going with the second option: everything was absolutely fine and dandy until *you* came of age and now, all of a sudden, things have gone too far... Doesn't that sound a little too convenient to you? Honestly? 

Like, gay marriage was unheard of just 25 years ago but you would probably treat it as a complete non-issue, but why? *That* is just fine, but *this*, a meaningless, single letter on an ID, this is a slippery slope, and what's more, these two things aren't even related? Surely you yourself can see that your line in the sand is ***completely*** arbitrary and a simple product of your age...

&gt;but when the movements start to promote the things they do in my country, then I can understand why some other country's have an aversion to entertaining their arguments..

Starts to? *Promoting?* What are you talking about?! It's been legal to change your gender in Hungary for *decades*. This was not an ""aversion"" to anything, it was an explicit fuck you in retaliation for absolutely nothing - a show of force with some ironic dick waving thrown in. FFS, Hungary doesn't even have *gay marriage*, it's not like you can say the progressives somehow went too far...

&gt;Clear up the image of your movement, and deradicalize your radical activists online, then re-approach this discussion like adults instead of emotional children, and stop assuming that transgenders need to have text on their ID to prevent the world from exploding. It is not nearly that important and if you think it is you may have deeper problems than dysphoria.

""Sit down, shut up, don't make a fuss, this is all your fault, be thankful that you're allowed to exist, otherwise I might use what I believe is representative of your movement to justify my baseless *spite* and oppose you for no good reason. I'll tell you what is and isn't important, and it's *not you*.""

&gt;Take care, let's agree to disagree.

Just come out and say that you don't give a shit about what trans people experience and save both of us some time, hm? Don't give me all this BS about how you have ""no issue with transgender people""...

1954,"The money the Netherlands spends isn't going to Italy, it is going mostly to countries that are not net contributors.
I never said there isn't any solidarity in the EU, look at all the money going to eastern and parts of southern europe for development, of course there is solidarity, and quite a lot (though of course this solidarity isn't just for the benefit of those countries, but of us all). 

Also, I never said I was against reforms, of course it depends on the kind though. Austerity like what we saw in Greece is not something that works (clearly), but there are plenty of other reforms that can be done to make the situation better and that I would be very happy with (e.g. among others tackling tax evasion and tax havens, because of course The Netherlands is also not the only tax haven in the EU).

We are talking about a country that has always been a net contributor, so the attitude of ""southern stupid beggars that can't even do maths"" is distasteful and unwarranted quite frankly, not even net-negative countries that take tons of money from the EU seem to receive such treatment. This sort of attitude that I've been seeing is really counterproductive, it just ferments negative extreme feelings on both sides and it is really quite gross.

Clearly the current framework of the EU is not working for Italy, we have an overvalued currency and so don't have as much to gain from the monetary union as countries like The Netherlands do. If further integration is not explored, this union doesn't make sense for us anymore. We are currently at a crossroads, either we manage to find a way to create a real union, or we should just go back to having a shared single market and no shared currency.
The UK recognised that this was the path the EU was headed towards and decided to stay consistent and leave, as it didn't want further integration. That is a completely fair and respectable choice, and if this is the same thought process that The Netherlands is going through, then they should think about doing the same, this way they won't have to worry about the inferior stupid beggars.

Edit: and by the way, regarding your first comment where you were saying ""why are you mad at the Dutch when other Italians are causing Italy's problems"", I have much stronger feelings of anger towards Italians who evade their taxes and who approve of backwards reforms than I do towards the Dutch tax haven status, but that doesn't mean I can't also be angry at the Dutch.

1959,"&gt;get a life, dude. You seem to have an obsession. 

More projecting. 

&gt;And yet you are the only one who demanded as many opt outs and that left.

Okay, but that's not the point is it? The point is that a not insignificant amount of the British public support the EU and you're casting them out with the rest of them.  

&gt;Besides, being 3rd contributor means nothing, since the contributions are not voluntary but based on a formula based on each member's GDP.

So by that logic *it means something*

&gt;It's like boasting to pay taxes in full. It's your duty, since you get back all sorts of benefits back. 

Okay, but if we're one of the largest tax payers we have a significant amount of influence from that hence why Germany sets the direction of the bloc in general. 

&gt;No, other countries joined the EU also because of the economic benefits, but those were only a part of the equation. Keeping peace in Europe and a more general feeling we are intertwined also played a big role in countries joining.

They joined primarily of the economic benefits and this has the fortunate byproduct of strengthening the rule of law and democratic accountability since that's the criteria. 

&gt;The proportion between the two varies depending on the country. Spain, for example, saw it as a landmark achievement on the path back to democracy. Germany did so to regain legitimisation in the eyes of the international community. 

&gt;The UK, on the other hand, joined 100% for opportunistic reasons. And you only have to see the timeline. Thatcher campaigned in 1975 to join and ten years later she was already distancing from the EU and painting it as the UK's antagonist. Check the Bruges speech, or the speeches she gave when Japanese car makers started investing in the UK. I suggest you read this very informative book, which I bought myself and read in Waterstone's: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rule-Britannia-Brexit-End-Empire-ebook/dp/B07J246ZW6/ref=sr_1_4?crid=KP4Z4LCYOZ4F&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=britannia+unchained&amp;qid=1590004939&amp;sprefix=britannia%2Caps%2C178&amp;sr=8-4 . It chronicles the UK relations with the EU and it demonstrates that that relationship was doomed to fail from the beginning, because of the UK elite and its unreliable and anachronistic self depiction. 

Thatcher didn't campaign to join she campaigned for us to *remain* in the EEC, we had already joined two years earlier, she also helped usher in the single market which you're enjoying, you see, you don't have to be a federalist and support the United States of Europe in order to facilitate peace and cooperating *within Europe.* The UK elite is for the large part understanding of the need to be within the EU, that's why you had PM's since Thatcher emphasising the importance of it despite all its structural problems. Our relationship wasn't doomed from the beginning at all, it was multivariate sequence of events which helped usher in the no vote. 

&gt;The former Austrian Netherlands were incorporated with the Netherlands to create a buffer state against French expansionism (1830). 

Then Belgium was guaranteed its independence whilst maintaining strict neutrality which all of the major powers had to respect. Which Germany proceeded to violate. 

&gt;Except that democratic representation does not give you a material advantage in a war, that the German Reich had the best equipped and powerful army in 1914 and that its share of the world's wealth was greater than that of Britain]

Germany was wealthier but unable to sustain a long term war effort like we were able to. We're not talking about 1914-1918 in respects to democracy, the Kaiser held the real power and Germany was an autocratic militaristic state ever since he took the throne in 1888.  

&gt;So you can clad the UK's motivations with as much pacifism as you want, but the real motivations were that the UK didn't want a competitor in the global stage.

Just like Germany wanted to remove the UK from being a competitor, so what? Point is, we didn't violate treaty obligations, they did and invaded Belgium.

&gt;It's a legitimate motivation, France, Germany or Russia would have done the same, but believing that the UK sacrified millions of its men for Belgium is naive, to say the least.

I am talking about the policies used for the economic adjustment programs of certain countries in the last decade specifically and the policies used to tackle the previous crisis.This is not 1980 its 2020.

Some policies(austerity) were 100% needed but the extend,duration,how fast,and the long term effects were not really well thought out and had  undesirable effects and doubtful results.There has been much criticism even between EU officials and IMF.

Yes i can see how the North does not trust southern countries,but think of the following : 

Also for the most part Greece and Spain and Portugal (not gonna talk about italy because i dont really know much) have really shown commitment to reform and push through despite the effects of  certain policies,for example look also at Greece despite all odds their people upheld their obligations towards the eurozone and what they signed despite the heavy toll on the country.... 

Is that not proof of commitment from these countries? 

On the other hand we do not really have much to trust the north either. 



I am actually not a fan of mutual debt either with europe as it is right now. 

But the other option is EU bail out loans again....i just think maybe it would be better not to get any help at all but doubt its possible.

This is not a grudge thing, the media is interested in all sorts of places (it was not a grudge thing against Ecuador to me interested in Guayaquil).

I don’t know if you were born yesterday, but here’s a quick recap, they were ruined. The people of Greece had their lives and dignity stripped away from them. Their economy fell into a self-inflicted recession because of austerity. The troika, those responsible for the austerity, felt the need to apologise to them! Austerity isn’t a solution to all problems! This isn’t a black and white world. Economies differ from country to country, and so does the effect of the measures taken in said economies. There is no simple solution to a complicated problem. We did austerity, cut pensions and even healthcare. Do you know what we needed during this crisis? Yes. Healthcare. Austerity hasn’t changed anything, excuse me, it did, it worsened our situation. You don’t understand that the world is not a videogame with fixed solutions. You need to apply different solutions to different situations. You are not mean, you are insulting to those who are in the same Union as you, telling them they brought this crisis onto themselves.

For the UK fishing industry, as a whole, its an easy win. The majority of fish caught in UK waters are not landed or processed here. So the UK see's no economic benefit to it, so why allow the fishing to continue? If the fish stay in the water it re-builds the UK's fisheries, whilst also increasing the price of fresh fish due to a reduction in supply. The UK principally imports fish from non-EU states so the EU cannot put pressure on UK consumers via tariffs. It can only affect its own consumers and supply.

Brexiteers and leavers, you are so damn freaking stupid, deadly cruel and utterly worthless for me and the history of us, and even ideal generations, because Brexit is terrifying and horrible. I didn't just chose to remain... I have decided to undo the Brexit and threatens the United Kingdom into the proposed World War III, all once and for all!!!
If Brexit completes (on the actual end of the transition itself, which would eventually bring us to the true post-Brexit eras), then the UK is and will no longer be a real member of Europe Union, letting alone being a part of the near-namesake continent itself! Thus, Britain can never be a part of Europe!!!. If that happens (when the transition ends), then we must starts WWIII. Unity is far better. And so will the extra membership prevalence. Before this, we have to #StopTheBrexit ! Why? Because Brexit actually (beyond) sucks!
And there's still hope, because it can (still) be actually undone and overthrown, but it had to, you all just need to know what things it may make the suffering, and unite with me to protest and not give up. (Hint: Brexit had no real upside, as downsides exists in supposed of these ups, so don't dare trying to find it!)
So far, you're all so-called-positively wrong about it, but (thankfully) the remainers is all right. Thus UK is not allowed to leave EU, nor should anything Europe stay out of EU: because EU is the continental union, which requires all the nations from these (in this case, Europe) to participate. In addition, Brexit also means a political taboo to Europe, despite all the theoretical benefits. Therefore Boris himself must be blamed for all of this (because he started the Brexit), not just your Queen who wants to extend the transition. Every leavers (from yours too) should be blame too, absolutely no exception whatsoever. All of them.
With all said, if the Brexit-based transition successfully completes, we should start the WWIII to settle all of these next year at the earliest. We alway loved peace, but this seemingly simple trade and this kind of independency is eventually going to politically corrupts the UK. The Brexit is so complicated and politically poisonous, it could ruin the relationship between the UK and the EU and potentially break it. Unity makes sense, departure don't, and the Brexit way is a up-and-coming proof. We have to unite to make our world better, or else we won't be able to make full of it! And to do these, the only good way is to unite and improve, and UK should fully go back to its membership at the EU!
So, we have to rise to #StopTheBrexit and if it's too late for that, go start the WWIII and stop UK! Leave mean leave, but there must remains no Brexiteer or any leaver, and there shall never be!

2121,"&gt;Which could be a good thing in the long run for Europe, not so much for American interests, ironically. 

Or a bad thing for Europe...unpopular opinion here but it is worth pointing out the fundamental changes that would occur for Europe if the US and Europe part ways. The EU mostly represents Western and Northern European interests. Not the interests of Europe as a whole and certainly not the interests of Southern or Eastern Europe. Without the Americans smoothing out some of the largest issues,such as the especially cozy economic relationship between Germany and Russia and the lack of trust militarily in Western Europe to defend Eastern Europe. I can see the whole thing falling apart and going back to the old status quo of 1721. 

I have so far seen nothing to the contrary that if the US left Europe it would not return to the old compromise of 1721. Where Germany(Prussia at the time) and Russia split eastern Europe into geopolitical spheres of influence. After all if the Americans are not coming then will Germany really go to war with Russia for Riga? The Americans have to because the entire alliance system depends upon it, they have no economic links to Russia, and they have the military force to do it credibly. Germany does not have the military force to be that keystone, is economically committed to Russia for its resources and has not shown a commitment to leadership within the EU, from lack of Eurobonds to its court overruling EU law. Germany is not giving up its sovereignty to an EU it cannot outright control.

Im sorry but If I were Putin and I found out the Americans were leaving I would invade the Baltic 6 months after the US leaves, take the whole thing in less then a day or two, and send Germany a letter saying if they stayed out of it, Russia would not invade Poland as a buffer state and offer below market prices on Russian resources to the German economy. Will Germany spend millions of lives and billions of Euros, knowing they will be the ally of first and last resort? I have my doubts and most of Eastern Europe agrees, Its why Eastern Europe has become closer and closer with the US despite a falling out between Western Europe and the US; and Eastern Europe and Western Europe for that matter.

There is also the possibility of creating a whole new era in Russian-US relations. After all without Western European influence on US foreign policy it may become clear to American and Russian policy makers that their economic and political goals no longer overlap and working together against other foreign states like the EU is now in their political interests. Rather then Russia being boxed in by a US-European Alliance. You may see Europe boxed in between a hostile Russia in the east and the US in the west. 

Please tell me how you intend to solve the Eastern question without Germany doing things it has no interest in doing? Like being the corner stone of Eastern European defense, moving further away from Russia which it needs economically, and taking on a leadership role in an EU which has a lack of it. 

Not trying to be mean but trying to point out your asking for a fundamental change in the 1945 status quo...there will be a power vacuum and something will need to fill it. As of now Eastern Europe is more likely to create a new Polish aligned access with the Americans then stick with Germany in an EU given its current political trajectory. Eastern Europe needs western Europe economically, but it needs the US militarily given Russia's resurgence. Eastern Europe would not be the first to choose its political independent over its economic future, especially given the history of Eastern Europe and Russia. 

TL;DR dont be so quick to change status quo without understanding all the complexities which come with it.

&gt; Nope, actually fairly liberal. Just because people don't agree with your loony tunes doesn't make them Hitler, remember.

Ha. Yes, liberals rage on the 'Pseudo-science' of established medicine and the wage gap all the time. ""Just wait until you encounter the real world"" a classic liberal argument.

&gt; If you actually would like suicidal people not to kill themselves, you would help them instead of trying to put them into a secure bubble that bursts as soon as they contact with the real world. 

Yeah, that's why all the research shows dramatic decreases in suicides in countries where transgender people get accepted. Those are probably not the real world though.

&gt; Reminder that gender dysphoria is actually... a very common occurrence in teens undergoing puberty. They see their body change in ways they did not expect and are feeling weird about them. However, vast majority gets over those normally.

Yep, that's why those people are not allowed to transition.

&gt; If you catch that moment and feed into gender dysphoria and prolong it instead of helping them get over it, you're killing them. Pretty simple.

But some ‘anecdotal evidence’ if you will from my side: My parents never talked to me about the Armenian genocide. When I was 8 or 9 years old I befriended an Armenian boy who was the same age as me. We got really close and his parents were amazingly nice people. One day, my Armenian friend suddenly said “did you know Turkey and Armenia were once at war?” and I really had no idea what he was talking about. I suddenly just got confronted with that at such a young age by a boy who was also still just a little kid.

When I told my parents they got pretty mad about it because they didn’t want to raise a kid with political sentiments and wanted to tell me years later or wanted to wait until I found out about it myself. The thing is, when you confront little Turkish kids with Armenian genocide stories, naturally they will go to their parents who are deniers and get all their info from them.

Of course the Turkish parents are to blame for misinforming their kids, but most Turkish parents keep their mouths shut about it as long as possible. If the kid were to grow up to an age where he/she can form their own opinions on the matter by doing some research, maybe there could have been a generation of young Turks that more widely recognized it. But no, we don’t have that patience and confront little kids with it who then run to their parents and get completely misinformed.",,/r/europe/comments/gmo7pd/greeks_and_armenians_in_turkey_1900_versus_2000/fr9c1bf/,qwertyaq101,1589995094

2298,"I think the focus on frugality is wrong. With Greece, do you want to know where I think it went wrong? I think went wrong because Greece didn't want to reform. And forcing reforms on a country is bloody difficult. But the IMF and the Commission had to show results. So they focused on the ONLY thing where results can be presented clearly, which is the budget figures. So what Greece did was avoid reforms, but because they had to show something, they put all their efforts in budget cuts. Budget cuts were needed of course (their deficit was completely out of control) but it should not have been the only focus. Now you can argue whether it was the fault of Greece for resisting real reforms, or the fault of the Trojka for not pushing harder on reforms and accepting less cuts.

For Italy, the key question is going to be reforms. And to be honest, I don't think it is looking good. Conte focuses way too much on getting money and avoiding the ESM. What he should have done is say: ok, I know we have to reform, but no real austerity. Now he is just demanding money and refusing reforms, which does not inspire a lot of confidence in the North to be honest. Some of these reforms may be very painful, so I don't think Italy would be happy with reforms, but it should in the long run be better than just cutting. Because what happens when governments need to make deep cuts but don't want to piss off the electorate, they cut investment most. Why, because citizens feel less immediate pain when you cut investment. It reduces growth in the long run, but the effects are more indirect and less visible. 

Italy for example could make a good impression by banning cash money as much as possible. Maybe even completely. This would not only hugely help cut down on the black economy, it would also send a serious signal to the rest of Europe that Italy is really serious about those reforms. Maybe institute a wealth tax. I am not an expert on Italian taxes, but I had the impression there is no wealth tax on assets held in Italy. Not sure if there is a national property tax? For example in the Netherlands we had a wealth tax of 1.2% on all wealth over a threshold of around 25k (they now made it a little more flexible, with lower rates for small amounts of wealth, and higher rates for higher amounts of wealth). ANd there is also a tax on homes of I think it's 0,6% or so per year, for all homes up to around a million euro, and a much higher rate for the value of a house above 1 million. If you don't have those kinds of taxes, you should really consider implementing them. Even if you offset them by lowering taxes on labour, the net effect would be positive. Because too high taxes on labour depress growth, while a low tax on wealth is much less distorting because it is very difficult to avoid.",,/r/europe/comments/gmmrdr/denmark_the_netherlands_sweden_austria_rejects/fr8jggr/,GrandAdmiralSnackbar,1589980238

2327,"&gt; First part, totally agree, great summary tbh. Doesn't change the fact  genocide still happened. I could also talk about Russian and French  influence ""getting"" to old subjects and the loss of Balkan Wars heavily  getting into the skin of Ottoman rulers and them not wanting to lose  Eastern Anatolia, a piece of land Turks controlled for a literal  millennia to Russian armed Armenians and somehow justify the Armenian  genocide that way. Doesn't make it right. 

not said that genocides did not happen. the thing is just that i think talking about issues like these aka ""you killed my ancestors"" , ""but you also killed"" are not helpful. because these are stories which you can always listen from all sides. For me its more important to explain the historic development in order to understand how and why things turned into chaos. 

regarding that russia has armed armenia. there is also one thing which should be considered. in the mid of 19th century the ottoman government has smashed the kurdish principialities of eastern anatolia in view of a centralization of the empire. but without establishing a new rule in its place. The result of that was that many regions in the east became very instabil. Armenians as a christian minority had no right to carry weapons which has made them very vulnerable. As a result the local Armenian population has faced a lot harrasement and plundering by the local kurdish tribes - who have enjoyed a large impunity apathy because of being muslims. petitions were sent to the sultan in order to get a better protection but somehow it was not realized. As a result of that Armenian militias were formed smuggling weapons from Russia and try to compete with local tribesmen. So what want to say is that. the arming of Armenians was not ""just"" initiated by Russia in order to destabilize the empire. but more because of the vulnerable conditions and chaos existing in the eastern provinces in that time anyway 

&gt;Then they would have no one to blame for their horrible management of your country.  

i agree with you that Armenias leadership had a terrible state management but after the velvet revolution many things has changed. but the country still has problems because the bad conditions are not just a result of the leadership but because of the fact that its a very small, landlocked country with no ressources and more than half of the border being closed so the only access into the world is through georgia and iran -&gt; iran which is sanctioned as hell so its mostly through georgia",Armenia,/r/europe/comments/gn70sa/turks_in_historic_macedonia_19002002_source_in/fr8jtes/,g4ym3n1xD,1589980466

Editorial: Michel Barnier cannot be expected to allow the British to dictate their terms and cherry-pick what they would like from the trade talks  

Perhaps Michael Gove has lost his sense of irony, but it is strange to hear the politician in charge of Britain’s stuttering trade negotiations with the European Union asking the other side to show “flexibility”. When the British government has been seized, as if in some coup d’etat, by a gang of ideological Brexit absolutists, for whom national sovereignty is absolute, inviolable and non-negotiable, it is at least odd to hear a call for the Europeans to be a bit more easygoing.  

While it is true that Michel Barnier, the EU’s well-seasoned chief negotiator, has his mandate, and has shown signs of impatience with the slow progress of the talks, it is also true that he cannot allow the British to dictate their terms and cherry-pick what they would like from the talks. The British can squeal all they like that the EU is not offering the UK an appetising amalgam of the deals that Brussels concluded with Canada and Norway, but it will do no good, even if it was a fair argument.  

The EU is under no obligation to follow its own precedents, in any case. The reality of economic diplomacy is that size matters. The EU economy is roughly five times the size of Britain’s, and its exports to the UK, while lucrative, represent a far smaller proportion of their GDP than do the UK’s exports to the EU. A sudden loss of markets would cost many jobs in the UK and again proportionately more than the EU would suffer in a no-win, hard Brexit.

&gt; Norwegian seems like an airline which is going to manage that

Norwegian lost **half of its market share** because of the Boeing Max scandal. It was at 10 euros at the beginning of 2019. It became 5 euros at the end. 

Low cost companies are severely impacted because they run very tight ships with very little margin of error. These distruption will last for years. 

For companies that were barely profitable to start with, it's pointless.

2462,"&gt; Restaurants come and go all the time

What if thousands of restaurants all go out at the same time? What are the cumulative effects of that? Do you know what a recession is?

&gt; Once demand picks up, restaurants are basically good to go.

You clearly have never worked in the sector. For an entrepreneur restaurant is a big investment that takes time to pay off, if it ever does. To give you en example, my aunt has spend the last 15 years building a reputation for her restaurant. Now she won't be able to profitably open for several months. It makes more sense to shut down. That means liquidating the assets, cancelling the rental contract, firing everybody and maybe, at some point, reopening at another location, but probably not in 2020. This is happening all over Europe, at the same time. For you to say that nothing of value is lost shows how much you know about the world and life outise whatever it is you do. 

&gt; because people should reduce contact, so you don't really want to incentive that.

Agreed. So there's many, many jobs that are not coming back. So people have no money, so they don't spend in consumer products, so companies sell less, so they start firing people. Rinse and repeat. That's why  you need government action, because if you don't it spirals out of control and gettting out of the whole becomes more and more difficult.

2557,"Lol nope (save for Greece).

Spain ran budget surpluses up until the '08 financial crisis, while at the same time Germany was the sick man of Europe and broke the stability pact deficit limit again and again. So did France, yet Mediterranean countries didn't try to hold them hostage and fine then.

Italy, despite what the germano-protestant countries say, has been the most ""financially responsible"" country in the EU (for real): ever since the introduction of the euro Italy has had primary surpluses almost every year (primary surplus is a budget surplus without accounting for debt payment interest). Italy hasn't gone into (much) debt ever since the introduction of the euro, almost all of the debt they have is older debt back when they had the lira, yet back then Italy wasn't going broke (hint: the problem is the euro).

Yet the Netherlands and specially Germany have ridiculously [large current account surpluses] (https://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/nov/24/debt-crisis-germany-1931) ever since the introduction of the euro, violating the stability pact (but notice how they only whine when the beach and sunshine colonies break the rules). Without the euro, Germany and the Netherlands wouldn't have had those stupidly large current account deficits, since countries with trade surpluses see their currencies go up in value, so that would have meant that the guilder and the mark would have gone to the roof and the peseta, franc, lira, escudo and drachma would have dropped in value like crazy, and as a consequence of that, the South couldn't afford to buy German cars but the North could have taken advantage of devalued southern currencies, buying southern imports and thus driving up southern currencies and down northern currencies, effectively balancing out (unless either the north manipulates their exchange rate like the chinese, in order to keep exporting, or the south manipulating theirs in order to keep importing, which is unlikely; but all of this manipulation has a hard limit: foreign exchange reserves, and since the chinese have the most and they don't import jackshit since protectionist dictatorship, they can keep doing that for a long time, but a monetarily sovereign Germany and Holland couldn't have kept up unless they close their countries to imports).

In the end, through an artificial exchange rate (and the lack of a central treasury to even out regions, like in the US), the North has extracted more wealth on average from the South than what the South has gotten in return in the form of bailouts, however northerners try to paint themselves as the heroes and the South as lazy freeriders, since the quantity of money that flowed southwards through bailouts is easily quantifiable, but the money that went (and continues to go) northwards due to the inflated northern current account surplus due to the single currency is larger but incredible more complex to quantify.

The solution to this mess is either a centralized treasury and finance minister, which is politically impossible since german and dutch neolibs want to freeride and scapegoat the South and the South much rather prefer either homegrown neolibs or their own center-lefties; or a return to national currencies which is imho the best compromise.

We Europeans are addicted to ignoring evidence, as if we were American conservatives denying climate change while their towns flood when in the past they never had. There are mountains of evidence of fixed exchange rate collapse, yet we've kept erring, from every European country going back to the gold standard after WW1 and struggling to keep the exchange rate and with rampant deflation (UK Labour famously lost the 1931 election because of that, just to see the tories float the pound; or chancellor Brüning's deflation policy, which led to  mass poverty and the rise of the nazis, unlike during the hyperinflation period when the nazis were an extraparliamentary party), to Breton Woods and beyond, with the 1992 Exchange Rate Mechanism crisis, or as a British conservative called it, the Eternal Recession Mechanism and nowadays, the euro.

We were too bloody arrogant to listen to virtually every economist worldwide when they told us that the euro was a bad idea, instead, we acted like the soviets, plugging our ears and complaining about those damn anglo-americans. We laughed at the brits when they proposed a common currency rather than a single currency, what John Major (pro EU chancellor of the exchequer of Thatcher ie finance minister, and later prime minister himself) proposed, and in turn we indirectly fueled brexiters when the euro crisis unfolded and they were proven partly right.

Tl;dr: thanks to the euro, the North is able to have large current account surpluses, and they extract more wealth from the South than what they give in return in the form of bailouts. John Major, Thatcher's pro EU successor was right, the euro should have been a common currency alongside national currencies, rather than a single currency.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/gmq5x1/are_you_in_favor_of_a_european_army_someday_or_is/fr83dfy/,thispostgavemeptsd,1589966290

The British Overseas Territories are 14 territories which are not part of the UK but have constitutional links with the UK. They have local self-government (if populated) and their own citizenship. Their citizens are dual citizens of both the UK (as British citizens) and also of their local Territory. Non-Territorial citizens do not have automatic right of abode in a Territory (for example a Londoner can't freely move to the Caymans) and each Territory has control of it's own immigration system. They sometimes grant permanent residency (usually called “belonger”) to non-Territorial citizens. 

1 of the Territories (Gibraltar) is included in the European Union, although another (Akrotiri&amp;Dhekelia) is aligned with EU policy almost everywhere due to it's geographical location in Cyprus and the fact that all permanent residents of A&amp;D are Cypriot citizens. 

Lastly the British Antarctic Territory is currently in a state of “suspension of sovereignty”, where due to the UK's membership in the Antarctic Treaty System the UK does not enforce British sovereignty in the Territory but neither does the government renounce the British claim nor accept the claims of either Chile or Argentina.

Aside from Antarctica, 4 of the Territories are subject to ongoing international disputes - The Falkland Islands plus South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are claimed by Argentina, Gibraltar's legal boundaries are disputed by Spain and the British Indian Ocean Territory is claimed by Mauritius as it was formerly part of the Colony of Mauritius (and according to some sources Britain has promised Mauritius can have the Territory “when it is no longer needed for the US military base”).",,/r/europe/comments/gmldxn/guide_to_the_british_isles/fr7vea9/,ForestChapel,1589958552

Can you tell me what does per capita mean? 

And also where is this ""aid relief"" going? Is it the same place the rest of payments towards medical bills go in your country? I.e. insurance brokers and private equity firms that lobby the goverbment to leech off of government funding? Or is this ""relief"" being used to bailout corporations?  Because i think i know which is more likely.

What i'd like to know is who's benefiting here?

2719,"&gt; France and Germany are facing a rebellion over their plans for a €500 billion EU coronavirus relief package that opponents say will saddle poorer eastern states with debt.
&gt; 
&gt; Poland said yesterday that it had “serious doubts” over the proposal and looked set to join opposition by the so-called “frugal four” of the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark and Sweden, while the Visegrad bloc, which includes the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia as well as Poland, is also expected to join.
&gt; 
&gt; The Franco-German recovery fund, which was agreed this week by President Macron and Angela Merkel, would be raised through extra EU budget guarantees totalling some €165 billion, borrowing against that sum to raise €500 billion. The cash would then be issued as grants, rather than loans, meaning that the union as a whole would pick up the bill rather than the individual countries that benefit.
&gt; 
&gt; According to a leaked French diplomatic paper, “repayment could start after three years, spread over 40 years and be completed by 2060” — meaning a generation of extra payments totalling billions every year.
&gt; 
&gt; The proposal will be tabled next week by the European Commission as part of proposals for a €1 trillion package to soften the impact of the pandemic, to be discussed at a summit in June. However, all 27 countries in the union must agree to it for it to pass. Opponents say that the Franco-German proposals would leave northern countries and much poorer eastern Europeans, who have so far escaped the worst of the pandemic, with repayments totalling billions for money that would be spent on wealthier European countries that have been hit hard by the virus and its subsequent economic fallout.
&gt; 
&gt; “Central and eastern European countries are the EU’s poorest yet under the Merkel-Macron plan would be paying for grants to go to Italy and Spain as well as France, one of Europe’s wealthiest nations,” a senior diplomatic source said.
&gt; 
&gt; Bruno Le Marie, the French finance minister, admitted that the proposed fund faced opposition. “We still have to convince other member states,” he said. “And we shouldn’t hide the fact it will be difficult.”",,/r/europe/comments/gn5eif/macron_and_merkel_risk_rebellion_over_500bn_eu/fr7o7h4/,mulgrave2,1589952440

There is one interesting aspect of this event which can be seen in the map: Though Charles resided in Prague as King of Bohemia, he did not have to leave his territory to prepare and announce the first part of the bill in Nuremberg. On the one hand, Nuremberg was also directly subordinate to him as emperor. On the other hand, he had managed to gain enough territory in the years before that the Kingdom of Bohemia finally touched the outskirts of the city. By this he kind of established a trading route between Prague and Nuremberg which would later be called the Golden Road (Goldene Straße/Zlatá cesta) or Via Carolina.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/gmrwkj/oc_europe_in_1356/fr7of3m/,uberblau,1589952613

In fact, most publicly traded gaming companies have a P/E ratio of around 20. 220 is insanely high and it means currently CDPR is overvalued by a factor of 10. A high P/E ratio is not a bad thing in and of itself, it means investors trust this company's management so much that they're fine with investing now even though earnings are not great with the promise of the earnings and the value of their shares growing in the future. Basically investors are expecting CDPR to become a giant company.

The thing is that rest of the world aside from Europe and some parts of Asia simply haven't had centuries of nationalism.

In the Middle-East, people just live more mixed. In Iraq and Syria, Shias, Sunnis, Kurds, Turkmen, Druze, Yazidi etc live largely together. 

Ideas like splitting Iraq by religious lines ignores the one and very glaring example of actual natural borders - Iraq is situated between and around Tigris and Eufrates, splitting that makes logistical hell.

2785,"Short answer ""disappointment"".

Long answer, OH! well.

In Turkey when you basically get out from the school curriculum that way or another you end up with positive views of Germans and than them being the only big boy of Europe with no colonial past, with no prominent natural resources (other than human source of course), hard working, smart people(basic German prejudices) who made their country beautiful and successful kinda makes Germany respected by Turks.

For me it was again pretty much the same and I actually had pretty high expectations of Germans but after being there I've just realized that it's just Turkey with more racism and less religion and colder people. I've said less but there are still religious idiots there as well especially in ""Baviera"" etc. And they are not just low key racist but also anti-Turkish as well(this is not the ""rule"" it's not even majority but still it exist at significant levels), And Germans are the most arrogant people group that I've met in my life they ""know"" every subject better than anyone with no exception, even the subjects that they have no idea about because they think their ideas are more important then others. For example Brits are also arrogant but they also eager to listen and learn and are more easy going. Also like I said there are racism in Germany, I'am blond so according German higher thought council I'am not a Turk or can't be how can I !!! Or they never missed a chance to tell me that ""You don't look Turkish"" like they are gods who created us Turks and definitely know how a Turk should look like(they were saying it arrogant way not funny way just to be clear). Some Germans that I've met acted ""normal"" since they didn't ""assumed"" I was Turkish until I told them I was than they were changing their tone and as usual they never forgot to lecture me about MY OWN country like they know better than me, I mean according to some they did know better than me, they've learned a lot from their free and unbiased media about Türkei :)

Long story short I've always thought as a kid that Turkey was a shithole and Europe was just better at everything especially Germany who happens to be one of the best of Europe, than I've realized that Europe is also a shithole as well(no offence) hence disappointment.

Meanwhile Italy for example has the happiest people I've seen, they are warm, welcoming and kind also not arrogant but smart, so it's my new favorite European country now :)",Holy Galactic Döner Empire ,/r/europe/comments/gmo7pd/greeks_and_armenians_in_turkey_1900_versus_2000/fr7ddaj/,RevengeOfTroy,1589944769

Most people barely know Great Britain is just the name of the island that 3 of our countries are on. If an Irish person pointed out that they do not like this term being used then I am sure the majority of them will comply (after a bit of banter) since the majority of them do not care and doubt that they have ever nor would they ever say ""British Isles"" and ""ireland"" in the same sentence anyway.

At the end of the day sex is obviously real and provable with science but gender is a construct of society, there is no real biological reason why men shouldn't wear skirts etc. So wanting to do that shouldn't be criticized, its peoples own decision and they aren't harming anyone with it. Yet because of transphobia they get discriminated against and receive hate and death threats and all too often die by suicide as a consequence. Thats where the harm is, not in them wanting to be addressed as she.

I agree that there are issues with sports but those don't necessarily have to be reduced down to trans people, many sports for example have weight categories to allow for more even competition between people who are born with different body types. If there is a more heavy woman overpowering a weaker one in football that is just as ""unfair"" because she was born with that advantage but its accepted. If a guy just acts like he is trans to beat women in their competitions the trans community would call them out just as much.

Misgendering is discrimination which in many places is already illegal. These laws apply for intentional misgendering. Its not like you will get punished for accidentally calling someone by the wrong gender, its for if you do it actively and with a hateful intention. If you are a guy and I am your work colleague and keep calling you a woman because I want to imply you look weak for example then yeah, our workplace could also tell me to stop.

2948,"What a joke. 

&gt; Gender is a scientific term 

Please give me the criteria for what makes a term ""scientific"" 

That it has become part of language scientists use?

You claimed man is a ""cultural definition"" not a biological one.  What makes a term ""biological""? That its meaning is rooted in biology?  If that's the case then it certainly is. The current use of gender may have made its way into scientific literature, which is all that your links show, but its meaning comes from the cultural shift in the last couple of decades. 

And you have yet to disprove that study I supposedly cited from the 50's.

How about some studies that backs up your claim that infertile men are no longer men? Did they teach you his in school? 

 Its very obvious you don't understand what those research papers mean you just linked them because you saw them use the word gender. From your own link. 

&gt; The editors and most of the authors represented here share the  perspective that there does not exist a given, clear-cut distinction  between “sex” and “gender” (e.g. \[[6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12152-012-9165-5#ref-CR6), [7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12152-012-9165-5#ref-CR7)\])  and that what culturally passes as sex is indeed already gender. In the  neurosciences too, it is becoming increasingly evident that the  biological and social components of a gendered brain function or  structure cannot be separated. Therefore feminist neuroscientists are  still working to define an appropriate vocabulary for what is not  inseparable but interlaced, not fixed but alterable. 

So apparently they haven't managed to separate sex and gender. LOL 

You your self proved me right and calling me ""tranphobic"" is just the the cliche i wanted to hear &lt;3

2982,"Nice map! - I do have a couple of questions though?

How did you decide which parts of France to show as more autonomous? It seems slightly bizarre for example that you've put on Foix-Béarn but not Armagnac.

Related to that is there a reason that you've done this for France but not at all for other countries? For example I would have thought that the King of Majorca would have been independent enough to be marked out from Aragon.

The western tip of Normandy should also probably be marked out as part of Navarra, although that is debatable given the level of control there.

Also, it might be more accurate to portray Brittany (or at least the lower half) the same way you did Aquitaine, or at least put it in a similar red to England.

You've put the Anglo-Scottish border in the wrong place - it should look more like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/1334_Treaty_of_Newcastle.svg/1280px-1334_Treaty_of_Newcastle.svg.png) until 1357.

One last thing - there seems to be a slight discrepancy with how you've handled Wales and Ireland (and also English control of Ireland was pretty much limited to the Pale at this time IIRC). Wales was technically part of England at this point but isn't shown as such (which is fair given how much autonomy they still had) but none of the Irish territory was part of England, but is shown in the same colour as England, despite being far far more loosely controlled than Wales was. If I were you I would either make Wales a red colour, or make the Lordships of Ireland less red.

3040,"&gt; How did you decide which parts of France to show as more autonomous? It seems slightly bizarre for example that you've put on Foix-Béarn but not Armagnac.

&gt; Also, it might be more accurate to portray Brittany (or at least the lower half) the same way you did Aquitaine, or at least put it in a similar red to England.

I honestly had a very difficult time finding a map of France in this period that depicted the various counties and duchies within the Kingdom of France, and the Wikipedia pages for the ones I did know are nearly empty (in English at least). It was really disappointing, as I thought I did a pretty good job with my 13th century and 15th century depictions of the French Kingdom, but I wasn't sure what was still in place and what wasn't. That's probably my biggest disappointment with this map is this area, but I don't exactly know how to fix it. 

&gt; Related to that is there a reason that you've done this for France but not at all for other countries? For example I would have thought that the King of Majorca would have been independent enough to be marked out from Aragon.

This is very true. I've begun trying to do this more for my maps, such as showing the entities within the Bohemian crown, but honestly a lot of it comes down to information and how important it seems to others. No one has really said anything about the Crown of Aragon, and while I might one day go back and show it a little more accurately, it does become a dangerous game of feudalism for doing it then to Poland, and then Lithuania, etc. But the short answer is it seems to be a lot more accepted than France per say.

&gt; You've put the Anglo-Scottish border in the wrong place - it should look more like this until 1357.

In that map, is the brown English?

&gt; One last thing - there seems to be a slight discrepancy with how you've handled Wales and Ireland (and also English control of Ireland was pretty much limited to the Pale at this time IIRC). Wales was technically part of England at this point but isn't shown as such (which is fair given how much autonomy they still had) but none of the Irish territory was part of England, but is shown in the same colour as England, despite being far far more loosely controlled than Wales was. If I were you I would either make Wales a red colour, or make the Lordships of Ireland less red.

That's a good suggestion. I think I'll go back and show the Pale as directly controlled English red, and then the Lordship of Ireland a different color but still under the control of England.",,/r/europe/comments/gmrwkj/oc_europe_in_1356/fr6pn1a/,girthynarwhal,1589930737

Or you don't oppose one of his measures or denounce something he did. You are careful not to weaken him.

&amp;nbsp;

As far as I'm concerned it is much better to vote per-issue than to vote on people. Raise topics that elected representatives ignore, repeal laws they pass that are not consensual (incentivising them to make them consensual in the first place or risk political humiliation). Representatives are useful for practical reasons, to represent rather than lead. In the case of Switzerland you put up with them a bit, but the threshold is incomparably lower than elsewhere, since ultimately the power belongs to the people and not their representatives.
&amp;nbsp;

&gt; People are not smart, informed or willing enough.

Most of the current French parliament is made of people fresh to politics when elected. Many members of the European Parliament don't know shit about European politics when first sitting. Parliaments routinely vote incredibly shitty laws, or laws with glaring holes. Each year, governments propose laws that are nothing short of stupid that the parliaments vote, but that would never pass without massive clean-up if there was a risk that the population would trigger a repeal. That representatives would vote ""better"" is a nonsense. The reason you can get random people to judge a person for a crime, or a population to run a country as well as Switzerland, is that people learn a topic when they have to decide.

&amp;nbsp;

It is true of representatives as well, they learn by doing. The difference is that 1/ Representatives are much easier and less costly to lobby, 2/ They are less transparent, 3/ They are much less representative of society and its diverging interests than voters as a whole, 4/ Their decisions are less legitimate, which is a critical point for e.g. acceptance, 5/ They have party discipline, which means there are power mechanics, and they have meta game with other parties. The parliament is more susceptible to having irrelevant factors skewing the legislative process. Etc, etc, etc. Representatives do not vote ""better"", their use is elsewhere.

that Estonia necessarily sees that as a desirable approach, but I expect sees compromise as a necessary part of having France in turn militarily support Estonia.

A very simple (hypothectical) example is the Spanish leaving the auto industry for the Germans, as the Germans have an established and productive industry, better the Spanish, and for the Germans to leave their wine making for the Spanish, who are much better and more suited to making it than Germany. An obvious thing wrong here is the fact the auto industry is far more lucrative than the Wine making one, so Germany would gain far more from this than Spain. So, to offset this, Germany is supposed to pay Spain some money, which would be spent on growing and their country to be more competitive, producing higher value goods.

In general, upon the implementation of a single market, more industrialised countries producing higher value goods would gain a lot, while less industrialised goods would be unable to compete with foreign countries and their established industries. So richer countries are supposed to contribute far more than poorer ones, as the poorer ones may even be losing money from the entrance on a single market.

Sweden contributes a lot, but not nearly as much as they gain from the common market, so ""solidarity"" is a southern way of saying ""stop the bullshit or I'll leave the EU and crash **your** economy"".",Portugal/Bavaria (Germany),/r/europe/comments/gmmrdr/denmark_the_netherlands_sweden_austria_rejects/fr5vp9k/,Vic_Rodriguez,1589915448

It represents a dictatorship of minorities and not a fully democratic union.

Regarding the US, while it is true that times are different, the federation rose from the constitution and the civil war with a very heterogeneous people coming from all over Europe and not only Europe. Other heterogeneous systems like Switzerland live happily with 4 different cultures and languages, richer and poorer cantons, city and mountainous cantons, catholics and protestants, and the list goes on. So actually a federation or confederation seems to be the most effective and democratic way to respect differences towards a common goal.

He was called Hannibal (or Gannibal, depends how you spell it) and he was a great grandfather of Alexander Pushkin, one of the most important people in Russian history. He was also said to have encouraged the military career of one of Russia's most celebrated generals, Suvorov, who made his career under Catherine. Gannibal died in 1781 (so well into Catherine's reign, though he had retired around the start of her reign).

Why oh why do we need to invent these fictional people with no grounding in history when history itself provides us with great (almost fantastical) stories about people and their exploits. I guarantee that no matter how interesting they make the lives of these fictional characters, it will be nothing like the life of the real Gannibal. The man went from a dispossessed son of a warlord enslaved by the Ottomans to being educated in Russia as the Emperor's godson and being involved in some of the most important events in Russia's history (all the while having a bunch of noble and royal descendants, not to mention Pushkin).",,/r/europe/comments/gmnihm/rostov_not_the_father_but_rostov_the_knyaz_in_the/fr4p0yi/,confusedukrainian,1589893869

The AfD has most of its powerbase in the former GDR (Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern). If they lose their support there due to extensive infighting they will drop even further. But these are also the areas where the ""Flügel"" is the strongest. For example Kalbitz (the man just kicked from the party) was a powerful member of the Thuringian AfD (I think it was Thuringia, not 100% sure), which weakens them. It remains to be seen if the AfD can successfully get rid of the powerful extremist members while also maintaining the radical parts of their powerbase (which they need) but I doubt it.

 OP accuse blame France for it's intervention in Libya. and completely and conviniently ommit to mention the complete shitshow that was about to happen due to the Arab Spring. An open civil war in Libya would have been way worse and migration would have been even bigger (see Syria).  Imo, Italy should have been the one doing the job. But they didn't. That's not a problem to us either, but don't blame us for cleaning what would have normally fall on you.

&gt; the act of kindess to Libya people is also bullshit.

One is not exclusive of the other. It was both to avoid being under an immigrant wave, and also to help the Libyan. The post intervention management was bad, but what can we do? Invade and police north Africa? So we can hear yall bitch about Francafrique? No thanks. So we do nothing and let a war happen, 600km away from our coast? No thanks either.

Wow, I wasn’t aware of that. Thanks for pointing out such an obvious thing to me.

My point was that morality can be implemented through policy and public pressure.

No. Are the able to make small incremental improvements through policies? Yes. That’s where the difference is between the US and China.

Reliability means not lying. Something that China has done far more than the US and something that the US has a much harder time doing because of all the organisations working independently from the government.

3683,"&gt;  Is it common to know what the PMs of all the countries look like?

No, especially not the Belgian one. I'm not even sure whether Belgium even has a government currently, because that is a thing that often happens. I think they do though (bc of the Rona), and I think it's a woman.     
Anyway, it always depends. A random person from the Banat, doing Erasmus in Spain is definitely not expected to know who the current Belgian PM is. A Dutch person working in Belgium might know it.

Usually you more or less know what the current leaders of the big countries look like, so that'd be Macron, Merkel, Johnson, and maybe Sanchez. Italy is a whole other can of worms, bc they have technocratic governments and government changes mid-legislative period so often. But everybody knows Matteo Salvini and Silvio Berlusconi.

And then, often there's some smaller country's leaders, that get a little spotlight of international/European media, which is why you'd recognize them. E.g. former Greek PM Alexis Tsipras (in the media because Greek debt crisis and all that, and being a clear leftist he was a bit of an ""enfant terrible"" among the mostly conservative European PMs), or current Finnish PM (in the media because she is a very young woman, and, lets be honest, because she's very attractive for politician-proportions -&gt; yellow press loves that), or Hungarian PM Viktor Orbán (in the media a lot bc he's basically a dictator).

&gt; (2) Restrictions may be ordered only pursuant to a law. If the restriction serves to protect the free democratic basic order or the existence or security of the Federation or of a Land, the law may provide that the person affected shall not be informed of the restriction and that recourse to the courts shall be replaced by a review of the case by agencies and auxiliary agencies appointed by the legislature.

What the BND did, and now can no longer do is to employ (mass) surveilance without justified suspicion. Just like the police. They can still gather intelligence data through other, legal means. And once they have sufficient reason, they can spy on that foreign military leader, as article 10 (2) allows.

Also, the legislature has to make the BND regulations comply with article 19 (1) of the basic law now:

&gt; (1) Insofar as, under this Basic Law, a basic right may be restricted by or pursuant to a law, such law must apply generally and not merely to a single case. In addition, the law must specify the basic right affected and the Article in which it appears.

3766,"That's kind of a less relevant scenario because the actually common occurrence is that of automated mass surveillance of telecommunications data. DE-CIX in Germany is the largest internet exchange point in Europe and the second largest world-wide. Immense amounts of international traffic are routed through it. The BND is searching all of it for whatever it is interested in, only using an algorithm to supposedly exclude most of German data. This is because it is not disputed that the German Constitution places restrictions on infringing on the secrecy of communications in its 10th article:

&gt;(1) The secrecy of correspondence as well as postal and telecommunications secrecy are inviolable.

&gt;(2) Restrictions may only be imposed by law. If the restriction serves to protect the free democratic basic order or the existence or safeguarding of the Federation or a Land, the law may provide that the person concerned shall not be informed of the restriction and that the legal process shall be replaced by a review by organs and auxiliary bodies appointed by the people's representatives.

A law (aptly named ""Article 10 law"") goes into more detail on how control is to be maintained. However, the BND has held that communications between foreigners in foreign territory are not protected and therefore the BND is allowed to conduct mass surveillance even if the data stream is routed through Germany. 

This is problematic because German communications are also monitored (there is no algorithm able to completely prevent that) and second, as this judgment now has clearly found, Article 10 in our Constitution does not actually just protect Germans, but everyone (""Jedermann"") and is binding for German institutions even if dealing with foreigners.

Funny you call me the ignorant one, when you're the one with the close minded attitude.

This post was talking about someone who influenced history in a big way, and who also was homosexual. Being homosexual wasn't what made him influential, it was part of him. 

I don't think LGBTQ+ people want to go back to times where they were ostracized for being gay, or lesbian. It's only recently that we've started accepting them, compared to the period where we didn't.

So I'm not quite sure where you get the idea that you can't establish a company in China. Also, Afaik, there're definitely foreigners establishing and running business in China. You cannot do certain businesses, like as a foreigner you can't establish a bank or oil company. But for the most part of the private sector, you're free to do anything. You can freely found an internet company or new media company as far as I know.

In terms of buy land, according to the Chinese Constitution, no one is allowed to buy land in China because it belongs to everyone. However, you can lease the land for certain years (70 for apartments, 40 for business use). If you want to buy a private apartment, afaik, foreigners are allowed to buy anywhere in China. Actually, for some cities like Beijing, even Chinese without Beijing Hukou are not allowed to buy, but foreigners can. Foreigners are subject to additional property tax, but they have more rights in terms of buying.  If you want to ""buy"" raw land, I don't know how it works for foreigners.

In March 2020, the total extra-EU trade (imports + exports) fell from EUR 252 billion to EUR 228 billion compared with January 2020.

This pattern was observed for exports with all five main trade partners, with highest trade decreases with Switzerland (-8.5%) and China (-7.1%), followed by Russia (-6.8%), the United Kingdom (-6.2%) and the United States (-4.2%).

Imports from these five main partners also fell over this period. However, for Switzerland (-1.2%) and the United States (-2.6%) the decrease was notably smaller than for Russia (-8.2%), China (-10.9%) and especially the United Kingdom (-17.0%).

Correspondingly, the total trade with the United Kingdom (-10.4%) and China (-9.6%) dropped the most among these five trade partners (in relative terms), while smaller decreases were observed for trade with the United States (-3.6%), Switzerland (-5.3%) and Russia (-7.6%). Among the EU’s 11 main trade partners, Turkey (-13.0%), India (-11.8%) and Norway (-11.7%) recorded the highest drops in total trade, while trade with South Korea only fell by 1.9%.

Let it go already, don't need any power beyond ability to protect self, which is something we can do without a centralised Europe. Your centralised Europe is really a thin veiled call for dictatorship by the corporate elite. It's anti democratic and also doomed to failure because of cultural differences.

You don't need a centralised europe to collectively negotiate trade agreements. This idea of centralisation is the same as saying people should get married with people they barely know and live in the same house to get tax benefits and cut costs. great on paper, will fail in reality just like the US and soviet union did.

Also this absurd focus on competition. I don't want to compete with the US, China or Russia. I want *cooperation (but not union). This idea that you have to compete with everybody is something cooked up by free market ideology. Compete for what exactly? Hegemony? I'd rather focus on building up a successor or expansion to the UN as a decentralised platform and harbringer of justice and democracy where applicable.

As I said: Many southern European economies are not competetive for various reasons and having a strong currency only makes it worse for them. 

Who do you think is mainly responsible for all those problems these countries have? They got temselves into this. Currency is one of their problems and at least in the past they were able to compensate some of those problems by devaluing their currency. Now they can't do that anymore. But of course currency is by far not their only issue.

The working german citizens are going to pay most of Germanys share of this recovery fund while benefiting significantley less than those who own the German companies.

Aside from that... Germany was a wealthy export nation long before the EU or the Euro. The EU doesn't have to be a transfer union in order to have a shared market. 

If southern European countries want to be prosperous they are free to set up their own recovery funds and finance them by taxing their own citizens or borrowing more debts on the financial markets (as long as they pay it back themselves).

4376,"I'm not even confident that they will pay it back any time after 2050, either. So far repayment of the greek rescue packages has only be delayed and shifted further into the furture and part of the intrest they had to pay was given back to Greece (as far as I am aware at least the German government wants to gave all intrest back as long as they comply with the rules). Even if they would pay back the about 270 billion € that all European countries (not only Germany) borrowed them, if they don't have to pay intrest those 270 billion € will be worth a lot less in 30 years (or whenever they start paying back) than they are worth now. 

Anyway, regardless of intrest, I don't think the full amount will ever be payed back for 3 main reasons: 

1. They can't. No amount of economic growth that they could achieve and no amount of reforms they could make would ever make them able to pay back their debts. They need a significant debt cut or they need to go default and leave the Euro zone (going back to their own national currency would solve a lot of their problems). 
2. They don't want to.
3. They don't need to. As long as the biggest net payers in the Euro zone are willing to do anything it takes to keep every country in the Euro zone they will keep giving any amount of money, credits or guarantees to any weak country that needs it.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding reforms: I am not nessecarily advocating for gutting goverment spending. I want them to reduce spending money on social benefits that go above a minimum amount that is necessary to make ends meet. And I want them to reduce inefficiant goverment bureaucracy. They can increase spending on education (provided it leads to results) and they can increase investments in industries that lead to economic growth. 

And more than that I want them to improve their income sides. They can increase taxes and dues to the same level as the German citizens have to endure, they can tax wealth, they can increase retirement age while reducing the hight of pensions (to the same level as in Germany). Also I would love to see them to crack down on corruption, tax evasion and undeclarated labor. 

It was their citizens that elected their current and past governments and it was their citizens that benefited from the debt that has been collected in each of their countries. So don't you think it would be fair if their citizens are the ones that pay first before asking others?",,/r/europe/comments/gm3kh3/merkel_and_macron_500_billion_euros_for_the/fr20d4r/,-GrimmWar-,1589828999

&gt;If you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other. So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.

So then the Court ordered the non-gay-marriage countries to recognise the two as spouses for the purpose of citizenship. Is that not an intrusion in domestic law by the EU? Of course it is.

4461,"What are you on about? The term race refers to groups of people who have differences and similarities in biological traits. It's broken down into 4 or 5 racial groupings for the people of the world, three of which being Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Negroid. Each individual categories have their unique features. The gens they carry in their DNAs reflect on the phenotype as physical features. For instance, such characteristics like slanted eyes, yellowish skin color, short stature, unique Mongoloid skull type are formed on the Mongoloid people by means of which they vary from others. Those characteristics are all enciphered onto their genes and also are inheritable to the next generations. You cannot inherit language nor culture. They are completely different and irrelevant concepts. Neither you emigrating to China to adopt and practice Chinese culture and learn the language as fluent as a native speaker would help you become Chinese even a smallest bit nor would it help your descendants. I think you're, more likely than not, confusing race with ethnicity if you're not simply trolling. Ethnicity, on the other hand, bears more of your definition of race as it refers to groups of people with shared cultural practices, languages, and such distinctions that set them apart from other ethnicities. Ethnicity is a shared cultural heritage among society. The most common characteristics, distinguishing ethnic groups are ancestry, a sense of history, language, religion, and clothing.

4479,"&gt;Uuuuh, who the fuck cares about karma count?

Are you new to Reddit or what? What do you think massive subs like /r/Aww, /r/Pics etc. are all about? People karma whoring. For whatever reason a lot of people really seem to care about karma scores. That's also why you get so many reposts, a lot of Reddit users basically just repost older popular things over and over for karma.

&gt;This sub upvotes a number of other ""European day of X"" with much better upvote ratios.

Really? Posts like [On this day 80 years ago Germany and the USSR signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. That's why today we mark the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/cu9505/on_this_day_80_years_ago_germany_and_the_ussr/) has 83% upvote ratio. An 80 year anniversary remembering victims of vile regimes and it barely gets more than this post.

If you can't get people to agree that those system were vile and mistreated and killed a huge amount of people, then why would you expect more for a badly made image will spelling errors, mistakes and oversimplifications? I'd think that more people would agree that killing millions of people was bad than they'd agree that identity politics, gay marriage etc. were huge issues honestly.

&gt;Downvote is used as a sign of disagreement

That's not how downvotes are supposed to be used and it never was. It's against the Reddquette. It's not an agree/disagree thing but a system to promote interesting things, posts etc. and to discourage things that add nothing to the conversation and so on.

&gt;Please don't

&gt;*Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.* Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.

[Source](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette)

/r/Europe even has the rule: ""No low effort participation in discussions"" which is there to help promote actual conversation instead of ""YAY DIVERSITY!"" or ""80% upvoted?"" type posts and the ""Low-effort content"" rule that ought to apply to stuff like this entire thread. This is the fucking definition of low-effort. Posting a poorly made image full of errors, oversimplifications and spelling errors for ""Look at me! I'm good!"" karma, AKA virtue signalling.

&gt;Lmao. I'm guessing you fit in this group?

Of course I do as it's bat shit insane how history has been ignored to fit the current ""Diversity is our strength!"" mentality. It has never been a strength and it still isn't. Diversity of nationality, culture, religion, race, skin color, politic or whatever has been the cause of every war ever. If there was no diversity of religion for example, there'd be no religious strife or war in history. The exact reason religion has led to war was the fact that there were differences in what people believed, AKA diversity.

&gt;I hope you realise gay people aren't ""made"", they exist everywhere, it's a question of whether they understand they are gay and that that's OK, and whether they feel safe identifying as gay. By saying ""less diversity please"" the gays won't disappear.

Of course I realize that. I don't give a shit who you're turned on by, who you'd like to marry etc. as it doesn't affect me in any way. Why would I give a shit? So I'm perfectly fine with gays existing, getting married etc. but that doesn't mean that I will never disagree with something gay people say or that I will celebrate nonsense like this day. 

How can you on one hand say that gays are just normal people like everyone else, should be treated and have the same rights as everyone else etc. and on the other hand complain about other people not finding something as trivial as sexuality worth celebrating? Either sexuality *is* a big deal or it isn't.

China doesn't allow Western companies and investors in China fair business practices or equal opportunities that the West is so concerned about providing.  
  
All Western companies doing business in China are required to turn over sensitive technologies and patents to Chinese competitors in exchange for access to the country's markets. According to a 2010 American Chamber of Commerce report, U.S. businesses were losing Chinese sales because of rules to support homegrown technologies. In addition, in some sectors, China will only let foreign firms operate through joint ventures in which Chinese partners have the majority stake. Companies that refuse to play ball are left on the outside, forced to pay potentially hefty tariffs at the border for the goods they ship to China.
  
Are these fair business practices or investment opportunities that we have in the West?

&gt;That's not how downvotes are supposed to be used and it never was.

But it's how its used by 99.99999% of the user base, don't act ignorant. Anyways, the replies to my comment more than show that it isn't just an issue with the post itself, but with its content.

&gt;Diversity of nationality, culture, religion, race, skin color, politic or whatever has been the cause of every war ever.

No it hasn't. Do you want to know what is the single largest cause of conflict in the world? Greed and nationalism. ""I want what that nation has"". How else can you explain wars between the same religions, races, kingdoms? Most wars fought between nations happened because their rulers felt they had a chance to grab more power, religion, race, betrayal were often just the prefered justifications. 

WW2 didn't start because Hitler hated jews, it started because he hated the Allies for Versailles and thought he could take them on. ""Diversity of nationality"" lmao.

Even if every human was an exact copy of each other, there would still be conflict and war, they would find new differences to separate them.

&gt;If there was no diversity of religion for example, there'd be no religious strife or war in history.

No shit, without religion no religious wars. There would still be wars all the same.

All of this without mentioning that this ""diversity that caused wars"" was *between* countries, not inside them, so really its more like xenophobia, nationalism and racism caused those wars. Look at how you twist these concepts to fit your wierd ass world view.

Sudenly the hate between different races is caused by diversity, lol. It's not like more diverse countries tend to be less racist, right?

""This conflict started because race A hated race B! This would've never happened if race B didn't exist! Diversity is the issue."" 

The idea that human differences are the cause of wars and conflict is just hilarious to me. I know a fix! Mass imigration is by far the best way to go, everyone mixes with everyone, 1 race for everybody, no more wars! /s

4569,"*Vosotros* is part of the regular vocabulary in Spain.  Not ""most"".  All.

*Vosotros* is the ""real"" plural, 2nd-person conjugation. There's nothing strange about it.  *Ustedes/Usted* emerged as a formal way to address someone sometime in the Middle Ages, and took on the 3rd-person conjugation.

This linguistic ""social distancing"" emerged in several European languages (both IE and non-IE languages), in some form. In French, for example, the 2nd person plural *vous* was used instead of *tu* to address a single person out of respect or social distance. Portuguese, Italian, German, Greek, Polish, Bulgarian, Dutch, Russian, Czech, Danish, Catalan, Finnish, Hungarian, Turkish and so on, all have something similar, either by taking the plural like French, or taking the 3rd person like Spanish, or something else.

This happened in English as well, where *thee* was the ""normal"" way to address the 2nd person, but *you* emerged as polite or formal. But in the English-speaking world, the formal *you* eventually completely replaced *thee* in both formal and informal situations. Same thing happened in Mexican Spanish, where in the plural, *ustedes* just replaced *vosotros*, and is used in both formal and informal situations. Mexican Spanish, however, kept the *tu/usted* distinction in the singular, whereas Spain kept it in both the singular and plural. In Portuguese, *você/vocês* is the equivalent of *usted/ustedes*. In much of Brazil (not all), *você/vocês* have just become the default.  Portugal keeps the distinction and has added a new level of formality, above *você/vocês.*

Americans learn, by and large, standard Mexican Spanish.  So anything from Spain or Argentina will come off as strange.",,/r/europe/comments/glyu08/motor_fuel_in_different_european_languages/fr1o0kp/,skyduster88,1589823029

4602,"The culture of social distancing does strange things to us. A few weeks ago I got an invitation to an offline work dinner, and I can’t remember the last time I had such a sudden rush of joy. Even if life in Sweden over the past two months have been surprisingly normal, the truth is that we all have hunkered down a bit. Many of us have worked from home. The first two weeks, I admit, felt as life in remission – like a sudden gift of time. But then we all sunk into the apathy of having our life on hold. It felt pointless to plan for the future. A reunion with the colleagues became a distant wish. Meeting a work contact for lunch? Surely that’s only something for the privileged few. So getting that invite to a work dinner felt like I had secretly been given the password to attend a Roman bacchanal.

The Swedish economy has finally started to un-Zoom itself. Bicycling lanes in Stockholm now feature the morning pelotons of commuters again. Carmakers like Volvo have opened up their factories and white-collar workers are gradually returning to their offices. Most workplaces have developed their own routines and protocols for Covid-19 safety – and, frankly, most of it is common sense: make it easy for staff to keep good hygiene and avoid having many people showing up at the same place at the same time.

So there’s no hot desking. Those who cannot bike to work are allowed to come in or leave early so they can avoid crowded buses and tubes. Lunch boxes are delivered by restaurants to the workplace. Meeting rooms and common spaces are closed or furnitured around protective acrylic glass. Colleagues that have had coronavirus get additional responsibilities. At the Stockholm accountancy I use, one of the bosses who got infected in early March now manages the afternoon cake trolley. They call him ‘Mr. Antibody’ because he doesn’t relish the corporate fitness programme as much as the cakes he serve.

It’s common sense attitudes like these that have made foreign observers to take a second look at the ‘Swedish experiment’. We’re no longer just the bad boy of corona – the jumped-up little country that refused to accept lockdown. Yes, we have observed social distancing, but individuals and firms have been allowed to figure out on their own how to practically organize things without having to shut everything down. So the real Swedish experiment has been about ‘behavioural change’: getting individuals to voluntary change their behaviour to avoid getting infected or spreading the virus to others. And it has worked.

All this means quite a lot now. Swedes have had ten weeks of training themselves in how to live together with the virus. 'Sweden represents a future model if we want to return to a society that we do not have to close', says the WHO’s Mike Ryan. Most people in Sweden aren’t generally afraid of meeting other people or being in environments where the virus could spread: they manage the risks by keeping a social distance. Polls show that more than 50 per cent think they have had coronavirus or that they will get it; only 15 per cent think it’s improbable. Perhaps it is this attitude that have prompted so many around the world to think of us as reckless and foolish: we have, in our normalcy, become an ethnographic study object. But all the training we’ve had in sharing the society with coronavirus has taught us that it isn’t dangerous to leave your home or send your kids to school. People don’t have to fearful of living their life in a pretty normal way. Remarkably, seven out of ten Swedes think the future actually looks bright.

Trusting people that they’ll take advice and change their behaviour have also had the desired result. Mobility declined, but not to a level that crushed the economy. The epidemic modelling did not factor in that people would react to a request. 

Screenshot_2020-05-17_at_14.23.11.png

Swedish Covid-19 trends are pointing in the right direction. Fewer ICU beds are now occupied, especially in Stockholm where the number of patients in intensive care has dropped by almost 40 per cent since the peak. The daily intake of new intensive care patients is now in the low double digits. The daily death toll flatlined in the second half of April and, mercifully, has since been on a declining trend. And then we have the reproduction rate of the virus – the famous R number that now seems to command much of the British exit strategy. We’ve been warned by Neil Ferguson and others that Sweden’s R number is still in the region of 1.3-1.4 – meaning that the virus still spreads exponentially. However, the Swedish Public Health Agency gives a very different estimate: the R has been below 1 since mid-April or so, and now stands at about 0.85. 

Screenshot_2020-05-17_at_14.29.12.png

Excess mortality is still the bugbear for foreign observers who want to learn from Sweden. It’s also an issue for Swedes. Even if the time for comparing and making judgements about coronavirus mortality is a few years into the future, it is obvious that Sweden has a big scandal on its hands: it has failed to protect nursing homes against the virus. More than 50 per cent of all nursing homes in Stockholm have had infected residents. For the country as a whole, almost 75 per cent of all Covid-19 deaths were residents at nursing homes or elderly with home care. Something has gone badly wrong.

Screenshot_2020-05-17_at_21.30.20.png


What’s going on here? Obviously, the Public Health Agency – along with other agencies – failed to understand the risk that staff could spread the virus in care homes. For a long time, nursing home and home care staff had no access to personal protective equipment (PPE), and once they got advanced equipment, few had been trained in how to use them. Swedish nursing homes also have many residents, and they come there at a very late point in life – so when a virus gets into the nursing home, it can infect many ‘elderly-elderly’ who are frail and have a poor immune system. Add to that failures of centralized medical procurement, for instance, or government complacency in building up capacity to test care workers. It’s no consolation that we share all these problems with other countries. It took us weeks and weeks to fix all these problems, and some of them still haven’t been adequately resolved.

Boris Johnson doesn’t need a warning from Sweden about the risks of care-home deaths: Britain’s experience is actually worse. But he can learn from the Swedish example that people will respond to advice about social distance and change their behaviour. Boosting testing capacity is necessary, as is keeping track of the reproduction rate. But at some point Britain needs to take the plunge and encourage people to go about their lives. It’s understandable that many Brits don’t want to end the lockdown and expose themselves to greater risks of getting infected. There is so much that we don’t know about the virus. But confinement is not a good way to manage uncertainty. Just as people with opposing ideas can become political creeps when safe-space culture protects us from them, the world out there gets scary when we shelter in our homes for months.",,/r/europe/comments/gm3bk2/sweden_has_pioneered_an_alternative_to_lockdown/fr182bw/,casualphilosopher1,1589815009

Authoritarian progressives and right-of-center reformers love Peter I for his hard-line management style and radical reforms of the Empire.

Authoritarian centrists like Catherine the Great for the ""Golden Age of the Russian Empire"" (a Golden age for the nobility, but this is usually not mentioned)

Paternalistic reformers love Alexander II for the abolition of serfdom and many liberal reforms.

Сonservatives-Slavophiles like Alexander III because he is a big, bearded man who represents everything Russian, being 1/256 Russian by kinship. 

Those who are obsessed with religion and ""family values"" love Nicholas II because he is the ""Last Tsar"" and was shot by the Reds.

The moderate left and the extreme left love Lenin because he ended the war, gave away land and gave autonomy to the nationalists.

Those who are ""crazy-level"" obsessed with WW2 and Superpower-status love Stalin.

60-70 year-olds love Khrushchev-Brezhnev for the fact that they gave out apartments for free and in general, back then their dick stood like a solid rock.

The vast majority are fine, the ones who as of that date might be undercounting suicides were, worst, Greece, with a worst scenario sensitivity of recording just 51% of suicides, followed by Israel ar 56.4%, Finland at 59.4%, the UK at 62.5%, Spain ar 64.5%, Ireland at 66.0%, Sweden at 67.5%. Countries such as Austria, the Netherlands, Italy did very well it seems. Somehow I suspect people questioning the success of Mediterranean countries’ low suicide rates to reveal that, aside from Greece and Spain, the worst countries would be Nordic, or the U.K. and Ireland....

However this data is very old. Everything I’ve seen more recently shows a massive improvement in data collection. Coming from
Wales, we’ve massively improved the accuracy of suicide statistics in recent changes. [This study on suicides in Crete](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-018-1931-4) also found that while suicide rates are a little higher than official statistics, it is by less than 10% (which would have made it one of the best countries in the 2001 study). That would not change Greece’s position significantly at all. We are all developed countries with high standards for registering deaths - some countries may have greater stigma against suicide or families may be less likely to share that their loved ones died by suicide, but academics in every country are interested in suicide rates and wouldn’t let culturally induced fraud slip by without comment.",Wales,/r/europe/comments/glxz7h/suicides_in_europe/fr0m891/,selkiemorlo,1589800477

4806,"I never said being gay is a choice. Fucking a woman is a choice. Gay men are perfectly capable of fucking women and having children (it happens), it’s just that most choose not to.

Genitals has many functions outside of reproduction, especially in humans and other apes, such as social bonding, stress relief and entertainment. That’s why we experience orgasms and other feelings of pleasure. That’s why infertile people still fuck. That’s why we fuck with condoms. That’s why elderly people fuck. 

I also didn’t compare homosexuality to disabled people. Have you ever heard of menopause? I have, and I don’t believe every single women over 50 is disabled. 
I would still give these women the same rights as anyone else, and let them fuck whoever they want, because I don’t see the relevance of discussing the functionality of sexual organs when talking about gay rights in Europe.

None of this addresses the point anyway, and that I don’t think people rights should be determined by the capabilities of their bodies and possible limitations of their lifestyle. I value individual liberty after all and done random gay person not reproducing doesn’t effect me.

Afterwards Portugal shrunk in power immensely and Spain eyed uniting Iberia. To prevent this Portugal had to give concessions to Britain. A free trade agreement was signed dooming the Portuguese cloth industry as it was unable to compete with the British one. These close ties furthermore made it difficult to actually compete as infant industry needed to be protected against British one. This caused Portugal to become a resource provider for other countries dooming the nation to poverty. 

In 1913 the First Republic existed for 3 years and would exist 1926 when Antonio Salazar came to power and established the Estado Novo. The Salazar regime initially was more concerned with stability than growth until in the 1960s a shift to greater economic integration with the colonies came with a new technocratic elite entering the cabinet. [Portugal went from having 38% of the EC12 GDP/capita in 1960 to 58,6% of EC12 in 1973.

Extremism of other brands - Christian, nazi, left wing - never gets a blanket ''ban X people'', even though you have child pedophilia in the Catholic Church and literal mass murderers in Norway and New Zealand.

It was still relying heavily on industries of the first industrial revolution, textiles, coal, steel. GB was on the slide in relative terms. It had a lot of investments around the world, was still dominant in shipping and was making a lot of money through invisible earnings in things like insurance etc. But how long would that have lasted with a US economy expanding at an incredible rate in the Western hemisphere, an ambitious Japan in Asia and an already superiour industrial power in Germany (14.8% of global manufacturing output in 1913) potentially in control of the majority of the continents resources and industry should they have defeated France and Russia which they probably would have. 

GB's supremacy was built on dominant naval power and being the first to industrialise. With the rise of other naval powers and spread of industrial techniques to those powers with populations rising faster. supremacy was impossible to maintain.

There you go again with the typical propaganda narrative. Whatever right you have, which includes who you take into your bedroom, nobody cares. Stop thinking you're so important people care about what you do behind closed doors.

&gt;  First of all, it isnt even an illness, it is a part of evolution. 

Do you honestly believe this nonsense you're writing? Apparently becoming gay is now ""*part of evolution*""! Feel free to provide the scientific research and consensus on it.

&gt; Have you ever been 

Listen here snowflake, people have suffered worse in poverty, wars, famines, oppression, slavery, abuse, physical/mental limitations and a lot worse hardships than whatever you think you went through. And yet suicide rates are highest with those that apparently have a hard time understanding their own gender and actual human nature.

Perhaps as you stated... this is evolution taking care of those that would in any case result in an evolutionary dead end.

&gt; but if they choose to sleep with many men, let them lmao. 

Who is stopping them? Just don't cry about the STDs, the drug abuse, the prostitution, the physical abuse, the mental destruction and death that is a result of it.

&gt; And scientists agree that homosexuality is natural.  

Here you go again making generalizations without evidence besides your own propaganda sources. No, NATURAL is a heterosexual pairing. Unnatural is not procreating with the opposite sex.

&gt;  Scientist believe this also. Theyde back me up here. 

Again more unfounded propaganda. Just because you were conditioned, does not mean you were born that way. And I thought on aspect of the Alphabet crew was that people can switch orientation or even genders at any point in their life? So what is it? Born that way or you can switch teams at any point?

&gt;  it did actually help to have a community that had been through the same shit as me

4964,"&gt; While the corona-pandemic swallows up all the attention, the right-wing populist government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has quietly proposed to interpret the word 'gender' differently. From now on, marital status will include 'gender at birth', to be determined on the basis of 'primary sexual characteristics and chromosomes'. Everyone is either male or female, there is no room for intermediate forms ('intersex'). Translated to Judit's life, this means that under Hungarian law she will always be a man. For comparison: in Russia and Belarus, where the rights of lhbti'ers are also under pressure, you can register your sex change.

&gt; A member of Orbán's small coalition partner submitted the plan on the late evening of 31 March - coincidentally or not International Transgender Visibility Day. The next morning Judit saw the news on Facebook. ""I couldn't believe it. She felt thrown back in time. When she was 5 or 6, a therapist said to her worried parents: don't worry, your son will become a real boy. Every night I prayed to God, hoping that I would wake up as a girl. Because I didn't know what a transgender was, I thought only a miracle could save me.

&gt; In Hungary, the procedure has been considered almost frozen since 2016. People who reported to the ministry in recent years with all the necessary papers (including a psychiatrist's and a doctor's fiat), received - just like Judit - no answer.

&gt; But in February, a court in the southern city of Pécs ruled that name change is a 'fundamental right'. It seems that Orbán's cabinet wrote the bill in response to that ruling, says Tamás Dombos of Háttér, a non-governmental organisation that stands up for lhbti'ers. The plan is hidden in a big package of reforms, to get rid of the legal wrangling for good.",,/r/europe/comments/gli3cc/today_is_the_international_day_against_homophobia/fr0fxj5/,Yahvav,1589794219

And what would have changed if we did not allow Chinese companies from buying ours?

The technology transfer via ""joint ventures"" would have still happened, as made in China is an economic advantage because it was so cheap to produce there.

That could only have been prevented if we had forbid our companies from investing in China. But at the same time, the few companies that were not prevented from doing so would then have an economic advantage to ours, which might have resulted in bankruptcies. 

And lets not forget that companies like to move their holdings into non-Western countries to evade taxes. Those holding companies could still own the patents, IPs and move production to China. So even prohibiting our companies from investing in China could have easily been evaded.

The only possible move would have been to increase our default WTO tariffs until made in China was no longer economical.

Downside to that would be that trade with all countries that we have no formal trade deal with becomes more expensive. The EU after all has no trade deal with the US for example.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/glhf21/the_eu_must_temporarily_ban_china_from_buying_its/fr08wbl/,Alcobob,1589787400

5190,"He's a weird choice.

Middle-age guy who picks up teenager,s he doesn't know, for casual sex ... is that really the poster child for bisexuality?

I say bisexuality because he was engaged, and he broke it off, not seemingly (according to their letters) because he didn't want to marry her, nor because he wasn't attracted to her, but because he was also fond of ""..."" he speaks euphemistically about it in the letter I read, but it was clearly something sexual. ""Anonymous sexual liaisons with young men"" seems to be the thing, though others might prefer to guess it was homosexuality; it doesn't really fit the full story IMO.

He had a childhood trauma: he was pretty much abandoned by his parents and then sent to boarding school, he fell in with an older boy who he apparently idolised. It seems they had a good friendship; maybe things were sexual, or pseudo-sexual, that's certainly the message one gets of private boys boarding schools in England at the time. Then that boy died, pretty much his only friend and the one person who got him through the terrors of abandonment.  


My reading of it is that he likely went for liaisons with younger men to try and re-capture the relationship with his early friend. That he was probably obsessed with that person. That when he spoke with his fiancee about it not being fair on her, that it wasn't that he didn't love her - and want her sexually - but that his obsession with young men was going to ruin things.

Anyway, rampant speculation, but that's how I've read his situation.  


He was not ""gay"", as in he wasn't open about having a lifestyle of being homosexual -- indeed the whole ""the government chemically castrated him"" thing is a slight misnomer. He chose chemical castration; the other choice however was prison. He, as a brilliant chemist knew what the hormone mimicking chemicals would do to him. I think he realised his obsession wasn't healthy; born as it was out of trauma; and that's why he went along with it.

I also think that the events of him calling the police on his teenage ""friend"" whom he picked up at the cinema, I gather, aren't being fully told. To me it seems highly likely that he called the police not to report a normal theft, that would be idiotic, but as a patriotic effort to catch those who'd laid a honey-trap for him. He was arrested on a charge of gross indecency, because he called the police, he was no fool.  


What gets me most about the story though is that, certainly up until Trump took to the stage an older heterosexual man who picked up unknown teens (19, in this case; I don't have the detail of other cases) for sex would be widely villified; but for some reason this is ignored completely with Turing.  


Of course there are those, such as his main biographer, who want to tell Turing as a plain closet homosexual in order to use him as a proxy to tell their own story; and so have put their own spin on things.

TL;DR he picked up teens for sex; he had a fiancee; the story told about him doesn't add up.",,/r/europe/comments/gli3cc/today_is_the_international_day_against_homophobia/fqzpx35/,MaleficentActivity7,1589772693

IMO he most likely fell for a honey trap, lost some state secrets and so was left without much choice about reporting it. That seems the most likely explanation that fits the reported events.

5225,"Since mid-March 2020, EU Member States have taken restrictive measures to slow down the spread of COVID-19 that have an impact on the use of fuel for transport, such as restricting international air traffic and requiring people to stay at home.

Preliminary March 2020 data show noticeable changes in the deliveries of several fuels typically used for transport.

In March 2020, EU\* deliveries of gasoline and jet fuel fell by 15% and 27% respectively compared with February 2020, and by 24% and 22% compared to the average March value of the last decade (2010 to 2019). Although at EU level, the delivery of other fuels such as diesel, LPG and fuel oil increased slightly compared with February 2020, severe drops were observed in several EU Member States.

**Deliveries of oil products across the EU**

The COVID-19 containment measures differed between the EU Member States as to their timing and severity. The first EU country imposing severe nation-wide measures was Italy and the effects are particularly apparent in its data.

In March 2020, gasoline deliveries dropped in almost all the EU Member States. In some cases, they reached record lows (since the beginning of the time series in 2008), with the highest decreases in quantities observed in Italy (-40%), Spain (-33%) and France (-20%).

The deliveries of gas/diesel oil decreased in some EU Members States, while they increased in others. The highest decreases were observed in Italy (-26%) and Spain (-11%). Similarly, deliveries of LPG dropped by 27% in Italy, where is it widely used as transport fuel.

**Kerosene, including kerosene-type jet fuel, registers the largest plunge**

The national and international air-traffic limitations introduced in March 2020 had a major impact on kerosene demand. As a result, kerosene deliveries plummeted to record lows. The largest decreases in deliveries compared to February 2020 were observed in Sweden (-57%) and Italy (-52%), followed by Spain (-35%) France (-28%) and Germany (-20%).

The Ethiopian ""land grab and globalize for multinationals"" system is the preferred growth model of the west. Eritrea has been demonized for flying in the face of neo-liberalism and economic warfare that tries to isolate it from the world markets. BTW, Eritrea has one of the strongest currencies in Africa despite all the sanctions and economic isolation. To this day, Eritrea is still shut out of the banking cartel's settlement monopoly.

5410,"&gt;What does Turing have to do with the fact that today they are chemically castrating boys when they say they want to wear dresses? 

1. No they fucking aren't.

&gt;That's the homosexual agenda.

2. No it isn't, it's a figment of the deluded imagination of transphobes like yourself.

3. Even if this were actually were happening, it would be the trans agenda, not the homosexual agenda. It's recycled propaganda, so it makes sense you'd get them confused, but trans people and gay people aren't the same thing, so stop conflating them.

&gt;Instead of telling confused boys that dresses are for girls, they're pumping them full of chemicals so they can snip their balls off when they're 18.

4. I think you kind of got confused and hurt your own argument a bit. Typically transphobes pretend to care about gender nonconforming people by arguing that there's nothing wrong with men wanting to wear dresses and the trans lobby is forcing them to be trans to reinforce traditional gender roles, which is fucking stupid, but at least somewhat makes sense, unlike whatever argument you're trying to make.

5. I assume by ""pumping them full of chemicals"", you mean sometimes giving them puberty blockers that have little to no permanent effect (the effect of delaying puberty being temporary) which have been around since the 1930s and been around in their current form since the 1980s after many meetings with the therapist to determine whether they're actually trans or not so that they can delay puberty until they're mature enough to know whether they're actually trans and either stop taking puberty blockers and mature normally or stop taking puberty blockers and begin taking HRT.

6. Wow, you really don't know anything about bottom surgery (which most trans people don't even get), do you?

The work on lorenz is fully a Bletchley park effort. And unlike Enigma, they didn't even have any example of the machine. They reconstructed it theoretically.

Just statistically, one can see that Eastern Europe on average cares less for lgbt rights, less for the rights of migrants, and more for economic prosperity rather than social justice. Just saying “not all” doesn’t negate the fact that its the vast majority. 

That is why your argument about “well not all Poles agree on everything” is not really applicable. Because they all see themselves as Polish and have no desire to leave a Polish state, only to affect the politics of said state. Whereas there is little attachment to a European identity in most of the East and so they are more likely to just write the EU off as a failed experiment and leave when they are pushed to enact laws that they see as wrong.

5443,"Well the starfort is almost secondary. It's an interesting reading but Palmanova main goal was being an ideal city, it's a renaiscentine city built by venetian architects to satisfy the urge of building something perfect, idealistic. Talks about perfection and ideal state of an element were all the rage back in the Renaissance - at some point venetians got really excited to make it in such a way that it followed many geometric metrics, 9 sides because it can be divided in angles of 40 which is an important angle in geometry, because stars were commonly depicted with 9 edges. Besides the triangle and quadrilateral shapes the hexagon is perhaps the most iconic in geometry, and you can easily convert a nonagon into an hexagon as you can see above.

Another easy one is the fact that it has exactly three intersections that cut through it.

The ideals of perfection go much further beyond the geometrical one, service buildings in medieval times were also built having in mind the idea of being in their best position, so this idealism had practical reasons too. The Hexagon Square at the center has a contour made of a tiny sliver of water, signifying hygiene and purity, and a sort of clean plaza when you entered, such water was always cared to be clean in medieval times.

An ideal city would also be ideal in the military sense, and it's very interesting that practicality and standards of beauty and perfection intertwined - the star fort design was developed in Italy and became the gold standard for forts in europe, but besides that, the walls are completely covered in grass, to make the city sort of a sneaky curiosity, hiding from enemy eyes and to camouflage itself, the city was also built in a valley slightly lower than its surroundings to better help the camouflage of it and to better look like a part of the environment and not a green protuberance (hopefully I've explained myself) but not so lower that you could see the top of the city.

The government struggled to make people migrate to it as a lot of the local populace thought it was too austere, being built like that and the military personnel composed almost the only group for quite a while. To counter that, the government forcedly moved prisoners there, in a sense a penal colony.

5447,"True, but the ones struggling to remain competitive often have issues other than the Euro that is dragging them down. I study the economic impact of demographics, and one thing that is striking (from this perspective) is the fact that Southern Europe is demographically diverging from the rest of the continent, in a very bad (and possibly irreversible way). They have three key factors that are hindering them:

- people have fewer kids (than even other Europeans) hence the population is older

- the kids they do have have poorer school results (better than some countries in the East, but way below places like the UK, Netherlands, Poland, Finland, etc)

- they attract a lot of immigration but over 50% (in Italy, at least) have at most middle school education

This has contributed to tanking productivity, which has not risen in 20 years, on balance. This cannot be sorted out via anything that can be done with currency manipulation or central bank action. I am sure that demographics is far from the only factor, but these structural issues derive from a deeper malaise.

&gt;Abstract

&gt; This paper uses transaction data from a large bank in Scandinavia to estimate the effect
of social distancing laws on consumer spending in the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis
exploits a natural experiment to disentangle the effects of the virus and the laws aiming
to contain it: Denmark and Sweden were similarly exposed to the pandemic but only
Denmark imposed significant restrictions on social and economic activities. We estimate
that aggregate spending dropped by around 25 percent in Sweden and, as a result of
the shutdown, by 4 additional percentage points in Denmark. This implies that most of
the economic contraction is caused by the virus itself and occurs regardless of whether
governments mandate social distancing or not. The age gradient in the estimates suggest
that social distancing reinforces the virus-induced drop in spending for individuals with
low health risk but attenuates it for individuals with high health risk by lowering the
overall prevalence of the virus in the society.",Legoland,/r/europe/comments/glob5u/new_paper_calls_into_question_benefits_of_swedish/fqz386z/,DrLutz99,1589759118

5521,"A year ago the mayor of Tirana proposed to demolish the National Theatre(it wasn't functional but it was granted historical value) and build a new modern building which would look like a tower. Many people and artists joined the protest against it. The mayor started a propaganda war against them and went after many actors to turn them against their colleagues. It went for a while, but in the end he looked like he retreated from the plan to demolish it and went on hold. During this time, the PM ordered the army to go on the streets, and the city was full of patrols and humvees. He even posted a video of police brutality, warning everyone if they were caught outside the quarantine. This week, after a series of strict meassures that lead the public trust in government to decrease, the cops beat the shit out of a teenage boy because he was out after the allowed time. Since you are from Greece you should better how that turned out a few years ago when the cops killed a teenage boy. No one raised the voice. Again this week, he ordered to shut down a TV Channel(well known for the opposition against the government) Then out of nowhere, in the midst of the economic crisis caused by coronavirus, the mayor and the PM(both in the same party) returned their attention to the theatre. The Court ruled that they shouldn't call for an act until there is an agreement between the mayor and the citizens. The European Council asked the same about settling down to a common ground. The mayor said that on the next Monday, he was going to talk with his group about what to do. He backed up from the original plan to build a tower. Yesterday a group of people returned to the theatre to protest because they didn't trust what he said. During the Sundays, every kind of movement is prohibited so that made it even more vulnerable. Around 4:30 AM today, these fears came true. The police brutally stormed the building using violence and tear gas to clear it from anyone who was inside and within minutes the old building of the National Theatre was turned into a pile of rubble. The community was devasted, but even more later, when police brutality continued again against the protestors. The problem is that if we claim to join the EU sometime soon, but the government should have the dignity to openly say that we don't belong there and we should join the league of Turkey or Syria.",Albania,/r/europe/comments/gli6gf/today_in_albania_we_celebrate_the_rise_of/fqyl63t/,Bejliii,1589750378

5540,"The method was useless before WW2. Turing came up with seperate attack methods, and also methods that were used on different and more complex machines such as the 12 rotor Lorenz, Dolphin, Abwer and the Luftwaffe's code. They also broke the different Italian systems.  

From your link...

&gt;However, on 1 November 1937, the Germans changed the Enigma reflector, necessitating the production of a new catalog—""a task which [says Rejewski] consumed, on account of our greater experience, probably somewhat less than a year's time"".[57]

&gt;This characteristics method stopped working for German naval Enigma messages on 1 May 1937, when the indicator procedure was changed to one involving special codebooks (see German Navy 3-rotor Enigma below).[58] Worse still, on 15 September 1938 it stopped working for German army and air force messages because operators were then required to choose their own Grundstellung (initial rotor setting) for each message. 

The polish contribution was largely a headstart to show it was possible, 

&gt;Mr Gallehawk said you couldn't quantify how important the Polish contribution was but they provided a ""jolly good start"".

&gt;""What they did demonstrate was that [the code] was breakable and the Germans thought the machine was unbreakable,"" he said.

And also from your link 

&gt;Peter Calvocoressi, who became head of the Luftwaffe section in Hut 3, wrote of the Polish contribution:

5636,"&gt; In January 1952, Turing was 39 when he started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Just before Christmas, Turing was walking along Manchester's Oxford Road when he met Murray just outside the Regal Cinema and invited him to lunch. On 23 January, Turing's house was burgled. Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were acquainted, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation, he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time,[129] and both men were charged with ""gross indecency"" under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885.[130] Initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing's solicitor ""reserved his defence"", i.e., did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations.

&gt; Turing was later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor, and he entered a plea of guilty.[131] The case, Regina v. Turing and Murray, was brought to trial on 31 March 1952.[132] Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation. His probation would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal physical changes designed to reduce libido. He accepted the option of injections of what was then called stilboestrol (now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES), a synthetic oestrogen; this feminization of his body was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused breast tissue to form,[133] fulfilling in the literal sense Turing's prediction that ""no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I've not found out"".[134][135] Murray was given a conditional discharge.[136]

&gt; Turing's conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GC&amp;CS in 1946, though he kept his academic job. He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952, but was free to visit other European countries. Turing was never accused of espionage but, in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park, he was prevented by the Official Secrets Act from discussing his war work.[137]

Funny thing, regardless of the exact translation, is that even back in the day, near the height of the maghyarization process, few years before the revolution from 1848, a German scholar from Transylvania, Stephan Ludwig Roth, proposed Romanian as official language and said that Romanian language is the ""lingua franca"" that everyone speak in Transylvania, regardless of ethnicity, and when two strangers meet they start the conversation in Romanian, and just if they see they are both of the same, different ethnicity, start to talk in their mother language. 

The man was also against an union of Transylvania with Hungaryand was executed by Hungarians in 1848. No wonder Transylvanian Saxons also voted alongside Romanians (who were anyway the autochtonous majority) in 1918 for the union of Transylvania with Romania, and were mostly against any connection with Hungary

5746,"&gt;because where I live. Someone in the comments told me that more conservatives moved to Germany from Turkey.

It's all about money tbh. If a wealthy turk moved to germany he moves into a wealthy area. People with money are more likely to be sophisticated, and less likely to be highly religious. 

It's not about their race or their country of origin but what class they're from. 
If you moved to a better area (more expensive) you won't see the same ""turks"" as you'd see in areas with low income. Just like you're going to see more sophisticated germans in those areas. 

The fact many turks are part of the lower income class is the real problem and this is partly due to the same problem every migrant faces. 

As a turk who was born in germany and enjoyed great education and lots of opportunities I find it quite annoying to witness people around me equating the actions of certain demographics as correlated to race/ethnicity/religion instead of the most obvious: money. 

The phrase: ""you're not like other turks"", which I hear often, is a dead giveaway for this underlying bias. (Not that you say it, i just wanted to point that out)",,/r/europe/comments/gld5to/firefighters_of_izmir_turkey/fqxqda0/,Chouken,1589736260
