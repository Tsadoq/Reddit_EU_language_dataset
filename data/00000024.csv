The US also allowed exceptions. The US also only has it limited until their population is vaccinated. So it's pretty much the same as the UK.

Or would you define the length at some arbitrary point? If the UK doesn't export vaccines for five months, it's not an export ban, but the US doing it for six is one?

They took the world nègre (a racist slang) and turned it into something positive. Aimé Césaire wrote a beautiful text on colonisation, and how the europeans have been using barbaric methods in black africa, explaining that stopping this was not only important for africans but also for europeans.

195,"Economics benefits aside there is a growing security issue that has been unaddressed for decades within all the iterations of the EC/EU treaty frameworks. The term ""European army"" is a misnomer, it doesn't mean an army accountable to the Commission but it is another treaty framework through which Member States can link up, organise and share resources and information without the need to rely on a non-EU entity under the de facto leadership of a non-EU state; the US. The recent Trump administration highlighted the archaic nature of NATO and illustrated the risk attached to putting the security of 27 Member States in the hands of a foreign state that may not always be on the same page as the EU and the Member States. Trump actively undermined NATO and European foreign policy which caused difficulties that the EU was unable to solve alone. Whenever you read European Army it is just a NATO link entity that is in the EU rather than outside the EU, it is another treaty framework and there wont be any EU soldiers but soldiers from Poland, Germany, France etc. working together without relying on NATO. 

NATO was designed in a post-war Europe and it was an attempt to implement a neutral hegemony that would suppress any future war movements or sentiments in Europe. It was a sort of security that was attached to the future of Europe to prevent another war breaking out. It sort of achieved this during the balkanisation of Yugoslavia but under highly controversial means.

HELSINKI — Russia and China have formally invited countries and international organizations to join the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) project being developed by the two nations.

China National Space Administration (CNSA) and Russia’s Roscosmos said the ILRS project would be open to participation at all stages and levels. This includes planning, design, research, development, implementation and operations.

CNSA and Roscosmos will promote extensive cooperation for the development of human space science and technology and socio-economic progress, said CNSA deputy director Wu Yanhua.

The announcement was made at a sideline event of the 58th session of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the United Nations’ Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) April 23.

Russia and China signed a memorandum of understanding on the ILRS in [March](https://spacenews.com/china-russia-enter-mou-on-international-lunar-research-station/).

The development also follows Russia [backing away](https://spacenews.com/russia-skeptical-about-participating-in-lunar-gateway/) from NASA’s Gateway project. Roscosmos also recently indicated it was[ considering withdrawing](https://spacenews.com/russia-skeptical-about-participating-in-lunar-gateway/) from the International Space Station partnership in 2025. 

## Early ILRS outline

The China Lunar Exploration Project under the CNSA presented early details of the ILRS project—first proposed by China as an evolutionary, expanded stage of lunar exploration following the success of a series of missions launched since 2007—at the sixth annual China Space Day in Nanjing, east China, April 24, . Slides [detailing ](https://weibo.com/6618567819/KcpftkBxA?type=comment#_rnd1619422059900)the project appeared on social media.

The first phase involves using data returned by missions sent to launch by 2025. These will determine the location for a lunar surface base in the vicinity of the lunar south pole. Missions include China’s Chang’e-6 and [Chang’e-7](https://spacenews.com/china-is-moving-ahead-with-lunar-south-pole-and-near-earth-asteroid-missions/) and Russia’s Luna 25, 26 and 27 missions.

The second phase will run from 2026-2030. It will see Chang’e-8 and Luna 28 set down at the chosen site and mark the beginning of construction. 

The third phase will consist of multiple missions across 2030-2035. By this time China hopes to test launch its [Long March 9](https://spacenews.com/china-to-develop-two-super-heavy-launchers-for-moon-missions/) super heavy-lift launcher.

Earlier [Chinese visions ](https://spacenews.com/china-is-aiming-to-attract-partners-for-an-international-lunar-research-station/)of the ILRS outlined long-term robotic and potentially short-term crewed missions for this timeframe. A long-term human presence at the lunar south pole is the goal for 2036-2045. 

The ILRS will focus on water and mineral resources, in-situ resource utilization and manufacturing on the moon, require developing wireless energy transmission and nuclear power for space, and trialing effects of low gravity on biology, according to the China Space Day presentation

Areas of particular scientific interest include lunar geology and chemistry, the lunar space environment, moon-based astronomy, biomedicine and utilization of resources.

## Upcoming missions

Chang’e-6 is a 2024 former backup to Chang’e-5 which visited Oceanus Procellarum on the near side. The new mission would target the ancient and massive South Pole-Aitken basin on the far side of the moon. The spacecraft will also carry payloads from France, Sweden, Russia and Italy.

Chang’e-7 will consist of an orbiter and a lander and deploy both a rover and a mini-flying probe. It will be supported by a relay satellite and the various spacecraft will carry a total of 23 science payloads. Objectives include a detailed survey of the environment and resources in the lunar south polar region. The mini-flying probe will make in-situ observations of a permanently shadowed crater.

Luna 25 is a Russian lander targeting a launch in October this year and landing near the lunar south pole. The mission follows 45 years after the Soviet Luna-24 mission.

China has launched two lunar orbiters, a pair of lander and rover missions and, in late 2020, the complex [Chang’e-5](https://spacenews.com/tag/change-5/) lunar sample return mission. It is also [developing ](https://spacenews.com/china-outlines-architecture-for-future-crewed-moon-landings/)spacecraft and launch vehicles to allow crewed visits to the moon.",,/r/europe/comments/mzgqvj/russian_and_chinese_moon_base_project_has_early/gw0ma8r/,TsarinaLudmila,1619498965

As your second question, the answer is that there are many methods and that it’s done inconsistently. There is a specific set of inconsistencies when counting “international travelers” within Europe. As you can see from the arguments above, people disagree on whether it’s the national borders or the EU border that counts. This disagreement seems to persist when you look at the Internet as a whole.  So right there you’ve got at least one problem trying to compare numbers between Europe and anywhere else in the world.

286,"Article:

First they came for Alexei Navalny... then they came for those who dared to demonstrate in his support.

**Some 13,000 have been arrested since January;** though most were released after a few days in detention.

Now, the process begins to label Mr Navalny's anti-corruption foundation, the FBK, an extremist organisation.

That will give prosecutors the chance to hand down lengthy jail terms to its staff and its supporters for organising and financing extremist activities.

**The FBK is crowd-funded. Even donating in future could result in an eight-year jail term.**

""I think this is a move aimed at the final extermination of the organisation - if you like the 'final solution' to the Navalny question,"" says Russia analyst Maria Lipman.

""Destroy his organisation completely, destroy all the people who supported him, who worked for him, who sympathised strongly, and then let him rot in prison for as long as the government pleases.""

**The extremist designation would place the anti-corruption foundation in the same category as al Qaeda** and, bizarrely, Jehovah's Witnesses who have undergone cruel persecution in recent years at the hands of the Russian state.

""We should not think that everything is in vain and our efforts won't have positive results,"" said lawyer Ivan Pavlov from FBK's legal team. ""We are sure the organisations we represent did not violate any Russian laws.""

That's as may be but precedent would suggest Russian justice will show Mr Navalny's organisation as little leniency as it did Mr Navalny himself.

Most of his close aides have fled the country.

Their broadcasting operation is up and running abroad but they have not named where for security reasons.

Those staff who remain are acutely vulnerable.

Part of the organisation's strength, besides its blockbuster anti-corruption investigations, was its network of offices across 37 Russian regions.

They too were involved in exposing corruption - a network of mini-Navalnys stretching across Russia.

They were key in organising nationwide protests. They also campaigned to support the smart-voting initiative Mr Navalny launched in 2018, a tactical voting strategy to try and unite opposition votes behind the one candidate most likely to beat United Russia, the ruling party, in the polls.

There are parliamentary elections this September.

Smart-voting was Mr Navalny's plan for bringing a more robust opposition into the parliament.

Some believe that was why the Kremlin decided that the policy of relative tolerance towards President Putin's most vehement critic needed to change.

This Monday, the prosecutor ordered every regional headquarters' activities to cease operations immediately.

The head of the FBK's network of regional headquarters was detained.

In Kazan, an FBK employee was also taken in by police.

But the crackdown on Mr Navalny's regional teams has been going on for weeks.

The regional co-ordinator in Rostov said police last week tried to shove a truncheon down her throat. Every time she refused to swallow they cut her arm. The criss-cross of cuts is a disturbing image.

There is dramatic video of 24-year-old Aleksey Schwarz, regional co-ordinator in Kurgan, being bundled into the back of a car by plain clothes police officers.

It is not the first time he's been arrested. We'd spoken to him weeks earlier about a leaked audio recording he published which exposed the audacious fudging of numbers demanded by regional officials around last year's constitutional vote.

""If we don't reach our set goal, the reaction will be very, very sad,"" a district official is heard saying, in the recording.

""It will be very sad for the governor, very sad for me and for the heads of the regions who didn't show the result.""

He demanded the numbers be nudged upwards.

This is the kind of systematic electoral malfeasance that smart-voting is up against.

But Mr Schwarz told us then that he was determined not to give up, whatever the authorities did.

""I love the Urals, the Kurgan region and I am fighting for it,"" Mr Schwarz said.

""I am fighting even for the sake of kids of those security officers who complained about rising petrol prices even when they had me handcuffed in their car.

""I am fighting for a better future for their children, and for me and my children.

""Of course, I am scared. But I can't escape it.""",British ,/r/europe/comments/mzh01t/russias_extermination_of_alexei_navalnys/gw0o72g/,UKpoliticsSucks,1619500379

416,"I'm not sure that is the what happened in Germany. I mean the numbers and amount of opening up doesn't fit. They seem to have stricter lockdowns, more restrictions when things go up. The classic opening too soon, was done (in the course of the pandemic, once or many times) by say the UK, Portugal, Italy, Czechia or Poland. Was also done by say Russia, but they decided to ignore the death toll among elderly and keep it unofficial I guess, as open pubs and clubs are shocking, or maybe they are more immune, who knows, but in most of Europe the f-ups are very easy to spot. See where I live - Poland. Not really any wave 1, wave two (autumn 2020) due to opening schools with basically no rules, wave three due to locking down almost everything (stores, hairdressers etc) but ""forgetting"" a work form home mandate, even for... non essential offices (it was due to local laws, they did not want to enact a state of emergency for some reason, so couldn't enforce a work from home mandate, could just ""appeal"" despite knowing 60%+ infections were workplace, so they closed down places not causing infection for over a month to wait the wave out). It's even more visible in Czechia, as they opened up further before disaster. But Germany seems to be rather closed compared to neighbors the whole time. So I guess it's mostly the reaction based on case numbers (they react - with lockdowns on insanely low case per 100k people numbers) compared to say The Netherlands, France, Czechia or Poland. But they also open up slowly. Say non essential shops. OK, in Poland they might have contributed to the spread before Christmas (unlike Germany, Poland closed shops, malls, post Christmas, not mid December), but in Germany? Closed early in December. In the recent opening before lockdown re-opened, but appointment only? It's definetly not OPEN YEE HAW, so I have no idea what the hell they are doing differently compared to both the West like NL, FR (similiar strict rules, deaths similiarly being controlled) and East like PL, CZ, (real opening ups, resulting sadly in deaths and overwhelmed healthcare for some time).


So I'm baffled by German statistics, choices and timing. Not judging, just as a data buff. I mean I guess Germany is ""overreacting"" as in locking down sooner and harsher than other EU countries, which might be bad or good, I used to think it was good - fewer casualties. But with the weird uptake when all of Europe is basically on the end of the wave route, as the whole continent was summer last year (as it seems weather also plays a role), Germany being the odd man out has me baffled...",,/r/europe/comments/mz86vy/malta_reopens_shops_as_pm_says_virus_under_control/gvzth2e/,JoseMikey,1619482781

421,"&gt; There is only one company producing vaccines in the UK. What makes you say such a hypothetical company would not be forced to sign a contract similar to the one AZ signed?

Astra Zeneca's contract had that clause\* because that was what Oxford University and the UK government negotiated in return for Astra Zeneca buying the intellectual property rights to produce one of the very first promising vaccine candidates. You have to remember that at that point in time, the big pharmaceutical companies were all racing to be the first to bring a safe and effective vaccine to market.

The government wanted that clause in the contract because Oxford University's research on coronaviruses and adenovirus vectors had been publicly funded by government grants. The reasoning being that if the British taxpayer funded the research, the British taxpayer should benefit from the research first.

Other vaccine companies wanting to set up factories in the UK (of which there are already three — NovaVax, Curevac, and Valneva) already have a vaccine that they own the rights to, so the government doesn't have the same leverage as it did with Astra Zeneca.

Given that those new factories are supposed to produce something like 160 million doses between them by the end of the year, that that's not even including the UK Astra Zeneca factories and the doses we've purchased from companies that chose to supply us from non-UK plants (e.g. Pfizer, Moderna), and that we only need around 60 million more doses to fully vaccinate every adult, it's a safe bet that most/all of those additional vaccine doses will be exported abroad.

\* (and, for that matter, the clauses requiring them to sell their vaccine at-cost during the pandemic, and to continue selling the vaccine at-cost to developing countries in perpetuity)

&gt; As for the second point, Australia has some of the lowest infection rates in the world. They're having football games with 50,000 spectators all over each other. Don't you think Europe needs those vaccines a bit more urgently than Australia?

That sounds like a business decision made by Astra Zeneca, to be honest.

If they had unexpected additional doses beyond what the UK could use and they were worried about EU export controls preventing them from fulfilling Australia's order with EU-produced doses, I can see why they might choose to send excess UK doses to Australia over the EU.

I don't think that was the most *ethical* choice for them to make — they might well be fucked off with the EU, but that's hardly the fault of the EU's clinically vulnerable citizens — but at the end of the day they're a multinational pharmaceutical company. I can see them prioritising a customer who's *currently* happy with the service they've received, over a customer who's been publicly dragging them on the world stage and saying they'll never order from them again.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/myw1b1/eu_sues_astrazeneca_over_delayed_deliveries_of/gvztns8/,Ardilla_,1619482875

&gt;  
&gt;Without delays, but no later than 30 days from the date of signing of this document, a resolution has to be approved by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, indicating the territory which falls under the special regime in accordance with the law ""On temporary Order of Local Self-Governance in Particular Districts of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts,"" based in the line set up by the Minsk Memorandum as of 19 September 2014.

484,"&gt; Theory: People stopped complying with the restrictions. Like meeting all the time in private, not heeding precautions.


That sounds about right, but as I said, I live in Poland. Not a native here, though I've been here for 7 years, so not biased, but... it seems Poles ignore rules (covid19 included) as Americans, and I mean mid-Western Americans, as I was born in a rather ""redneck"" state and have family there. While Germans it seems treat rules and regulations with much more respect. I mean this might have changed during covid, but... well I didn't notice it. Due to my job, since Poland re-opened borders in June 2020 after three months of panic, I've crossed the PL/DE border many times. It's open. With no controls, or in case of flair ups in the neighboring country, there are supposedly rules, tests mandatory, quarantines etc, but since last June it's all on a trust basis, as border/police controls on other side are well, not there, except for maybe some media PR photo ops, but on a a daily basis, if they stop one car in 1000 I'd be surprised, I was never stopped (60+ trips both ways, in mostly Polish, but also German, Dutch and Russian license plates - corporate cars). But once I cross the border it's visible...

In Poland there is an any mask mandate, but also outside, so people wear either cloth or surgical masks, but not well, often ignore them, often put their noses out or where them on the chin. Outside, but... also inside, stores or public transportation. Now Germany has a more scientific mask mandate. FFP2, but only in INDOOR public spaces, and this seems to be adhered to much better. So while I can see ""in private"", though I do know Poles ignore that a lot (nice loud parties from neighbors etc)...


I still don't get why Germany has such numbers and is so locked down. It deosn't make sense compared to Poland and any other European country. With German rules, adherence as I see it (mostly in Berlin which supposedly is lax when it comes to rules) and German tests per 100k, it makes sense when France has say twice as much official cases and Poland or Czechia with less testing say 4 times as much, per 100k, but when Germany has the same, or as of now even more I'm baffled... but maybe I should take this to a covid or data sub instead of hitting you with walls of text.

521,"&gt;I am pointing out that EU does not produce or export any vaccines

This is just such a nonsense argument that I addressed many times. Any vaccine sent from an EU country is an EU export. I know that the vaccines aren't produced and sold by the European Union itself. It doesn't mean the same thing. If a television is produced in the EU and sold to China, that is also an EU export. It wasn't EU who produced or sold it, but it was produced in and sent from the EU, thus it is an EU export. But this is just semantics, please stop arguing about this. It's really dumb. You can google 'EU exports' and see that when we talk about a country's exports, we mean that it was sent from that country. It doesn't mean the government itself did it. 

Anyway, like I said, your argument results in many more deaths than otherwise. You will tippy toe around it, you won't ever directly address it, but you know what I'm saying is true.

&gt;AZ are at liberty to export doses to the EU as soon as they meet UK's order

Then it's perfectly fine that EU similarly ensures that only when AZ meets EU's orders, as stated in their contract, that they can export to the UK. AZ is far behind with the orders it promised to EU, so EU has the right to take action. Why is this all of a sudden a problem for you? 

&gt;You seem to think EU should be praised for not seizing vaccines

Of course they should be. Look at what UK and America is doing.

&gt;while UK should be damned for agreeing a commercial agreement

A commercial agreement that is unfair to the EU. Why is it fair that UK gets vaccines from EU production sites but EU gets nothing from UK production sites? The commercial agreement that the UK made directly leads to no exports of vaccines. The means don't matter when people's lives are involved, it's the ends that matter. Please answer me this one question: Do you really think UK didn't know that signing this agreement with AZ would mean no AZ vaccine would be exported for a long time? Do you not agree that this commercial agreement has had the same effect so far as if they passed a law banning the export of vaccines? Surely they knew supplying 100 million doses would take many months until AZ could send any vaccines anywhere else.

Truth is that EU has clearly been naive. Either they didn't know about the contract UK had with AZ, or they didn't think AZ would have problems delivering its doses regardless of the deal that it made with UK. EU should've also then signed a contract that would not supply UK any vaccines until it supplied EU with all its orders. But they didn't, they didn't have the foresight or information to see this happening. So now, to fix this unfair situation, they will be limiting exports to the UK. And aside from all the arguments to be made, there is one single big reason why the EU has the right to limit exports to UK: 

The retained vaccines will save more lives here than it will there. Their stupidity or naivety in negotiating such a contract does not excuse people dying, and people are dying in greater numbers (relatively and absolutely) in the EU than in the UK, which has vaccinated a much greater number of its elderly people already.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/myw1b1/eu_sues_astrazeneca_over_delayed_deliveries_of/gvzepsz/,handsomeslug,1619475504

592,"OK, I see.  Let me try again.

I assert that a chart showing CONTINENT level aggregation, that uses ""international tourism"" for its data, it likely to over-state the CONTINENT total by including rather ""local"" cross-border tourism.    This is because tourism is classified as ""international"" when it crosses a nation border, and borders are closer together in Europe.

But, the EU has no internal borders, you say.  True!  And yet travel statistics still count those borders quite often.  French tourism offices want to be proud of EVERY international tourist, whether from Burma or Belgium.  

For example [this page](https://www.condorferries.co.uk/france-tourism-statistics) \-- look at all the numbers!  Some are day trips, some are overnight.  Some count anybody from outside France, which means within Europe as well.  Some are specific to countries nearby like the UK.  

A shopping trip from Bruge to Paris would be ""international tourism"" by some of these measures.  There is not a good solid standard, and especially with the EU, there are multiple competing measures.  

And if you DO count the EU as a block it's still odd. A trip from London to Paris is international (now), and a trip from Gdansk to Madrid is ""not"".  

The end result is that a lot of the tourism TO EUROPE AS A CONTINENT is coming FROM EUROPE.  

Alas, the source chart exists but the source DATA it links to is 404 now.  So, what numbers are they using? 

Europe is still likely ahead per-capita as an attraction, but the ""counting basically domestic tourism as international"" seems like it would skew the numbers.",,/r/europe/comments/myx5un/europe_alone_gets_more_tourist_arrivals_than/gvzgsi7/,platitood,1619476509

688,"Canary Islands, Spain:     The SAR helicopter has already taken flight back to El Hierro with the survivors, three men, who are receiving the first emergency medical attention on the way.


It is not ruled out that among the corpses that remain on board the cayuco there is a woman and a minor, according to what the crew of the rescue helicopter have observed during the operation.

However, sources have specified that to have complete data, it will be necessary to wait until Guardamar Talía reaches the point where the boat is located after almost 20 hours of navigation from the south of Gran Canaria. The guard Talía continues to go towards the position of the cayuco, but will not arrive until tomorrow due to the distance at which it is, reports Europa Press.

The cayuco was located this morning by an Air Force Search and Rescue Service (SAR) plane that was scanning the area in search of possible vessels in a strip of the Atlantic where they are beginning to be out of the way and exposed to be carried by the wind and currents in the ocean.

The first impression of the plane indicated that there could be about nine people on board, prompting Salvamento to mobilize a helicopter with a long range range, while asking nearby ships to come forward to help.

However, the closest ship to that point, the Lady Doris, a 180-meter merchant ship, was five hours away, so the first to arrive were the crew of the SAR helicopter, even making a stopover in El Hierro. after leaving its base in Gran Canaria to have the greatest possible autonomy.

The first estimates of Salvage indicated that the Guardamar Talía would reach the cayuco at rescue speed at around 0.30 this morning. Now, confirmed that there are no survivors left on board, it is estimated that it will reach that point around 11:30 on Tuesday.

At the moment it has not been established to which port he will go back with the deceased, if to La Restinga, in El Hierro, the closest (about 490 kilometers) or to his base in Arguineguín (600 kilometers).

The number of 17 dead confirmed for the moment makes this cayuco the greatest tragedy on record in the Canary Islands since August last year, when the Civil Guard located another similar barge with fifteen corpses on board, without any survivors, about 200 kilometers south of Gran Canaria.

That is, if the bodies that have been recovered are counted, because if the balance is based on the testimony of the survivors, the greatest tragedy in recent months is the one that starred another cayuco located on April 11 about 220 kilometers south of El Hierro with four corpses on board.

Some of its 19 survivors told the Police that, when they left Nouakchott 18 days earlier, there were between 45 and 49 people, so that the number of victims of that cayuco ranges between 26 and 30, most of which were they were left in the sea.

According to a spokesperson for Caminando Fronteras, a Spanish NGO that reports notices of the departure of boats to the authorities to facilitate their rescue, at this time there is no news of five cayucos that left Mauritania for the Canary Islands over the last month , with a total of 283 people on board (63, 58, 56, 59 and 47).",,/r/europe/comments/mz715y/17_dead_onboard_a_kayak_to_the_south_of_el_hierro/gvyzdr1/,Jazzlike_Dog_8175,1619468615

690,"&gt; And the position of the Turkish government is that while a lot of Armenians died, it was not intentional.  
&gt;  
&gt;Quite similar leaps of logic if you ask me.

No. Because events are completely different. Turkey invaded Armenian territory and started massacre them, later when they were defeated they started to massacre them on the road back.

Arguing that this is not intentional is retarded, additionally it's claimed to never happen.

Holodomor is a part of great famine that struck USSR in 30-40s years of collectivization due to drought and class cleansing of kulaks. Range of ethnicities affected is not limited to Ukrainians alone.

Ukraine claims that this was Stalin plan to kill off Ukrainians. Dunno why.

They claim 8-12 mils ethnic Ukrainians dead, while Ukraine was ethnically diverse. So how you selectively starve 8 mills without camps - i don't know. At the same time for some reason Stalin stopped at 8-12 mils.

While actions of Soviet Regime is indeed atrocious - Selling food during famine for $ to fund industrialization, equally compared to actions of English Lords during Potate Famine that struck Ireland. That's hardly classify as intentional ethnic cleansing with the current available evidences. Which Russia is argues about. No one argues that event never happened.

Why all the countries that made up the now extinct Ottoman Empire are not included is beyond me if that is where the conversation is headed.

Comparing Arabisation to the Columbian colonisation of the Americas is completely off. 

We (British, Spanish, and Portuguese settlers) managed to wipe out the American Aboriginals thanks to Smallpox, which often vanquished entire nations before they even met white people (when Vancouver explored the Pacific Northwest, he found deserted villages strewn with bones of people who had died from smallpox epidemics which had preceded him). 

The Arabs in the 7th century did not have this biological superweapon doing work for them. Arabia at the time was a sparsely populated place with very few major population centres, while Egypt was one of the most populated lands on the planet. There simply weren't enough Arabs to really alter the Egyptian genome.

**While the US leads in tech, Brussels is setting the standards for online privacy and regulating AI**

The Americans innovate and the Europeans regulate. That was a simple way of explaining the interaction between government and the technology business. It is still broadly true. The European Union is not quite an innovation desert but nothing rivals Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook or Microsoft. The US has flubbed questions such as internet privacy, whereas the EU is a rule-making superpower. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of 2018 has become, in effect, a global standard.

Now the EU is flexing its muscles again, issuing proposed regulations on the hottest topic in digital governance: artificial intelligence, or AI. That is well overdue. Computer decision-making can determine whether you get a job, a loan, a home or a date, as well as what news or ads appear on your screen. The software that makes these decisions is almost impenetrable. It is “trained” on databases that may have serious flaws. If computers learn to make decisions based on information about young white men, say, they may botch choices involving women, older people or those with different skin colour.

Proposals for ethical AI abound but so far only the EU is trying to codify in law principles such as fairness and transparency. The result is far from perfect. Its 100-page white paper is replete with exceptions. A few things are banned outright, such as what it calls “subliminal” manipulation of individual decision-making. Facial recognition is tightly regulated (finding missing children is fine; Chinese-style population surveillance isn’t). Penalties are hefty: up to 6 per cent of a violator’s global revenues.

Lobbying over the details in the coming years will be intense. All that time and energy will underline the EU’s importance as the global rule-setter. It will also highlight the costs of the legislative vacuum in Washington. When American lawmakers decided ten years ago that internet privacy was none of their business, they in effect handed power to Brussels. They may not make that mistake again but Marietje Schaake, a former Dutch MEP now at Stanford University, argues neither the EU’s top-down regulation nor the US’s corporate-focused model are enough.",,/r/europe/comments/mz430s/eu_is_becoming_policeman_of_the_internet/gvyhdo8/,quixotic_cynic,1619460929

One reason is China. In the past, it was chiefly interested in overhauling the West, not shaping the world. Now China is a world leader in both AI and quantum computing (which can potentially unscramble secrets in seconds). Its internet giants do the state’s bidding: censoring dangerous ideas and tracking the activities of dangerous people. Advanced technology and effective dictatorship go hand in hand and not just at home. China sells its surveillance technology on every continent. Autocrats from Belarus to Zimbabwe are eager customers.

Meanwhile democracy languishes. Profit-seeking stokes polarisation: the tech giants’ main goal is not to promote good decisions, political harmony or individual happiness. They measure success by how many minutes we spend glued to our screens. If the duration rises because people are reading myths and hoaxes that make them scared and angry, too bad. Paradoxically, the more that we do online, the more the companies know about us and the more easily they can target us.

Infuriatingly, the tech giants can do better; they just mostly do not want to. As Anne Applebaum and Peter Pomerantsev report in an article in The Atlantic magazine, during the last US presidential election Facebook briefly tweaked its algorithm to demote spurious, hyper-partisan news and to promote “authoritative news content”. It introduced the change again, also briefly, after the attack on the US Capitol on January 6. The company refused to explain what exactly it did, how it measured the results or when it might take such welcome measures again.

Pessimism about all this is easily overdone. There is always a gap between what technology enables and society tolerates. It widens and shrinks over time. For the past 30 years, the gulf has yawned: cyberspace was the Wild West. Now it is shrinking.",,/r/europe/comments/mz430s/eu_is_becoming_policeman_of_the_internet/gvyhg3t/,quixotic_cynic,1619460959

One constraint is our own efforts in developing and applying norms. These can be devastatingly effective. A Canadian activist called Laila Mickelwait has shamed Visa, Mastercard and PayPal into shunning Pornhub, a previously untouchable colossus of smut. Its owners are now trying to rid their lucrative site of rape videos. That’s a start, anyway.

Lawsuits are another weapon. Dozens of US states and the Justice Department are trying to apply antitrust laws to internet advertising. The owners of the Daily Mail are suing Google for, they say, manipulating news search results and abusing its monopoly power (Google disputes that). In Britain the former children’s commissioner Anne Longfield is suing TikTok for its voracious collection of children’s data (which the Chinese-owned social video company denies).

These piecemeal efforts may bring good results but for the best combination of dynamism and democracy we need to see the internet rather as we look at the natural environment. Everything we do affects the future, spill-over effects abound and solutions involve aligning laws, market forces and changes in behaviour.

Some countries are already experimenting with systems that promote political agreement rather than rage. Taiwan has pioneered a version of Twitter called Polis that builds consensus and feeds into government decision-making. Perhaps the first target should be the pernicious, disinhibiting cloak of anonymity. Most people behave better in real life, so we should encourage realness online.

However, the towns official name is Gernika-Lumo. The name Guernica was given to the town by Francos regime as an effort to wipe out Basque culture, as he viewed them as less than other people, and not belonging to Spain. 

They did this with many other towns, some that spring to mind are Vittoria-Gasteiz (Gasteiz is the original name, and during Francos regime it was forcefully given the name Vittoria, after the regime it stuck and got added together),   
San Sebástian, (Original name Donostia, forcefully given San Sebástian. Only in the last 20 years the original name has gotten recognition)   
and Arrasate-Mondragón (Which was originally called Arrasate).

  
Anyway, you get my point. Because of that many Basques don't like the Spanish names, and while in most cases the new or joint name is official, in Gernika-Lumo it is not. 

While it is true that Guernica is simply a modified way of spelling Gernika, it was given to the town forcefully in an effort to erase it's culture, as was done with the entire Region of Euskadi (Basque Country).

822,"&gt; Have you even read my answer?

Yes, I did and it's a juvenile take. Hence my reply.

&gt; My point's not whether the particular countries have invaded Russia, it's that every country has invaded another country at some point in history

Did you even read *my* comment? Not every country has invaded other countries. That's the exact point I was making. Just because Britain colonized the planet doesn't mean Estonia did. 

I'm frankly sick of this ""well all countries did something bad so let's not dwell on what so and so did"". It's the same people that cry ""irredentism!"" whenever someone from a small country brings up how half of their ethnic homeland is part of another country. It stinks of ""I got mine, fuck you"" to high heavens. 

&gt; and I don't see why Russia is always portrayed as the BIG BAD WOLF when every other country either has done the same in their past or would have done the same given the opportunity.

Not every country has done the same and not every country even attempted to do the same even though they had the opportunity.

&gt; Just because we are in r /europe doesn't mean we should always act like Russia is the worlds biggest evil, Europe the best place on the planet,

So we're supposed to turn a blind eye to literal war now? What drugs are you on?

&gt; say that the USA somehow is not equally as bad as Russia even though they have done pretty much as much ""evil"" to the world and mention Asia only when it's about china's torture camps.

Do you not see how ridiculous you are? 

This is what OP said:

836,"It doesn't matter whether a majority or a minority of Scots disagree about the effect of independence, objectively it'll lead to economic ruin for Scotland in the short term.

I'll link an excellent response which I saved to a Scottish Independence supporter about the effects of independence: 

&gt;You value the ability to save time on a bit of paperwork for travel over protecting the thousands of businesses and millions of people in this country who rely on trade with the rest of the U.K, who also rely on the Barnett consequentials which allow Scotland to outspend its GDP by orders of magnitude and outspend any other region in the U.K. per capita on public services. You also clearly don’t value or don’t appreciate quite how damaging the (negative) changes to currency (whether that be the Euro, an independent currency, or sterlingisation) and therefore it’s effects on interest rates, mortgage values, exchange rates and personal savings. You also don’t appreciate the almost certain gutting of entire industries - most notably the defence industry which employs tends of thousands, and the tens of thousands of civil servants that work for the U.K. Government. We can also talk about the border, which will decimate the economy of the borderlands on both sides and put massive barriers in front of trade and cross border travel? or we can talk about capital and intellectual flight - why would anyone with money or valuable skills stay in a country where there is less return in terms of public services for your higher taxes than there was before, and no prospects in terms of skilled jobs, when the opposite would be true a mere 100 or so miles to the south? Also, why would any businesses set up shop here when corporation taxes will be so high in your socialist utopia when they can also go down south and have access to a far larger market and far less corporate taxes? Or we can talk about the implications for citizenship? What happens when millions of Scots refuse to renounce their British citizenship? What happens when people’s pensions (in an aging population) have to be paid with a smaller tax base and weaker currency?  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s an absolute farce and I’m sick of this shit from utopian fools with no appreciation of the inevitable disaster that would be coming our way.

987,"Yes, I should have said output and consumption.

The income approach is calculated as GDI or GDP(I) which takes into account nationals income from abroad and payments to other countries, which the ONS article doesn't include, so it isn't the income approach.

If this was the expenditure approach we wouldn't see an analysis of the UK public sector output, it would be based on the input costs plus export (minus imports).

&gt; First, GDP calculations **always** include the public sector output.

""One helpful approach is to look at GDP of the UK and other major countries, excluding public services.  While this made little difference to the fall in UK GDP – as the fall in the output of our public services was very similar to the overall contraction in the economy – for other countries it made the falls in their GDP look substantially larger. In Germany, for example, their GDP fell by an additional two percentage points through the crisis, once their public services were removed from the calculation. However, in this approach the fall in UK GDP is still one of the largest in the G7.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS), which works out UK GDP, [**published a blog**](https://blog.ons.gov.uk/2021/02/01/minding-the-gap-why-has-uk-gdp-fallen-so-sharply-in-the-pandemic/) explaining the differences in methodology.

The tricky part is how you work out the output of public services such as healthcare or education.

If you want to know the output of a normal business, you just look at how much it has made from selling its goods or services.

That doesn't work as well with the public sector, so the ONS bases its figure on measures such as how many people have seen a GP, how many operations have taken place and the number of pupils receiving education.

Things like the closure of schools and the cancellation of non-urgent operations meant that the output of public services took a big hit in the pandemic.

Other countries tend to base their figures either on how much money has been spent on public services or how many hours have been worked by staff delivering them. As the amount of money spent has not fallen, that method would show less of a drop in their output.

That is also how the ONS works out GDP in nominal or cash terms. ""Where the public services element is based on the money spent, the fall in UK GDP is broadly comparable to other G7 countries, and smaller than falls seen in Canada, Italy and Germany,"" it said.

""However, the 'real' estimates better reflect changes in the services being delivered.""

The real estimate is the one that takes into account changes in prices, which the nominal one doesn't.

The ONS also looked at a measure of GDP excluding public services, which it said made little difference to the UK (which was factoring in a decline in public services already), but made Germany's figure worse by two percentage points. However, it added that: ""In this approach the fall in UK GDP is still one of the largest in the G7.""

**TLDR, the UK measures the output of public services based on their use, not the amount of funding or hours worked by staff, but overall. ""In this approach the fall in UK GDP is still one of the largest in the G7.""**",,/r/europe/comments/myu7ly/uk_economy_set_to_grow_at_fastest_rate_on_record/gvx6xfg/,Tamor5,1619439639

It is not objectively wrong. EU countries answered call to war with zero risks. The moment Russia invaded Estonia the outlook would be completely different. Noone in Western Europe would be willing to send army there to defend those Russian speaking people from Russia and they would find thousands of reasons why not to get involved. WW2 showed as much.

Yes. You can open the link to the law text [itself](https://docs.cntd.ru/document/9003294) and check it for геноцид (genocide). 

A rough translation for article 2:

 Article 2. Repressed peoples are recognized as peoples (nations, nationalities or ethnic groups and other historically established cultural and ethnic communities of people, for example, the Cossacks), in respect of which, on the basis of national or other affiliation, a policy of slander and genocide was carried out at the state level, accompanied by their forced resettlement, the abolition of national-state formations, the redrawing of national-territorial borders, the establishment of a regime of terror and violence in places of special settlement.  

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; it mentions repression and it mentions deportation. 

If you're not aware, those both are tools of [ethnic cleansing politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing).

1196,"&gt;   I talked about fusion because I do not understand why even bring it up. 

The guy that called the Greens Anti-Science brought up fusion as the example. So yes it should be obvious that the point would be countered.

&gt;Your 15 years is completely off the marks.  

Quotation pending.

Let me be clear: You aren't able to show a single supporting document to show that a nuclear plant (in the west) would be able to be build within 15 years. And with build i don't mean just the construction. I mean all the way from initial idea to net synchronization.

Example: Hinkley Point C. First plan to build the NPP was announced in 2008. Construction of NPP itself started in 2018 (some work at the site started way earlier. A car park in 2008 for the ground investigation) and it's expected that the plant will go online in 2026. So 18 years.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinkley\_Point\_C\_nuclear\_power\_station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinkley_Point_C_nuclear_power_station)

Example 2: Flamanville Unit 3. Construction began in 2007. Estimated target to go online was in 2012. That was delayed to 2016, then to 2018 and construction faults now push the net sync to maybe 2022. Again 15 years. And that entirely ignores the planning phase.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamanville\_Nuclear\_Power\_Plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamanville_Nuclear_Power_Plant)

The costs meanwhile went from 3.3 billion to 19.1 billion.

Such fast, such cheap, wow. And it would be wishful thinking that fusion power has the chance to be build faster.

As such: Windpower is cheap, can be build comparatively fast. It can today already solve most of our problems.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/my7l2x/germanys_greens_chancellor_candidate_vows_to_get/gvwyfuq/,Alcobob,1619433280

1199,"Realistically we are seeing a strong tendency towards authoritarianism, partly as a result of increasing sense of hypocrisy when European nations lecture the developing world on how to build a nation when we are so divided; and partly because of the relative decline of Europe - which decreases our geopolitical impact.

So from a non-European perspective, Europe is perceived to:

(1) have actively repressed us, stolen our wealth, committed genocide, and generally kept us down.

(2) have robbed us of our cultural heritage and identity, arrogantly declaring often-iconoclastic western practices as the universal ideal

(3) be in relative decline for decades, but still espouses the policies which are destroying Europe, which makes Europe look (A)Delusional (B) Arrogant

1309,"&gt;This just shows me, that their ""environment-friendly technology"" can't be that serious if they want to COMPLETELY stop a project that could revolutionize energy production.

Even research shows that fusion energy will not be any cheaper than wind power. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544218305395](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544218305395)

Figure 11: Levelized cost of electricity. You will see that the min price of fusion is way above the min price of on-shore wind. But that min-price of on-shore wind energy is already achieved and the prices keep going down.

Heck, even off-shore wind is expected to be in the 40$ per mWh region by 2026.

Well he won't go to jail, but he will have to stay in involuntary mental care, until he is deemed to no longer be a threat. We have a similar thing in the Netherlands. These kinds of sentences in practice end up often being longer than normal jail sentences, because they have no set end.

In the euro system we have some sugar daddy clubs, in the American system those same kind of clubs decided to play only with each other. I fail to see the beauty in that...

&gt; Why negotiate when it just requires money to buy all the top players? 

Winning matches still beats negotiation into a league, and it always takes more than just buying all the top players. Still need a good trainer with the right concept, some experience playing together and all that - it's hard work even for top clubs. Hoffenheim could buy itself into the top league, but not to a title. Don't you have the same in American politics? Some rich jerk bankrolling his or her own election campaign, vastly outspending his opponent. You get good chances that way but there are still other factors at play. People still gotta like you etc. A big wallet may greatly increase your election chances or a title win, but it's no guarantee.

&gt; You didn’t understand any part of my point 

LOL when you said who gives a shit about German football, was there a deeper meaning behind it? 😂 Pls enlighten me - I'm all ears.

&gt;That’s literally the question I asked you 

Sorry I thought that was a rethorical question since you're such a know-it-all, and it also bumps with your not giving a shit...

Among the acceptable reasons why Bayern dominates the Bundesliga that much is that it's extremely well managed apparently (e.g. not up to their eye-balls in debt unlike Real for example). They mostly played their cards right financially and you can't blame them for that, nor the bigger spending power that comes with it. I think an American might get that.  
OTOH they sit in Germany richest city/region, so they have more powerful local sponsors like Audi and Allianz than most others. This is rather just luck and thus unfair IMO. The question is how much of their success is down to the former and down to the latter part - hard to tell ofc. But let's say hypothetically, if it could be proven that Bayern would still be the best team of Germany several years in a row without the inherent financial advantage, then I would accept this in the spirit of competition. I want to see different title winners, but not artificially and for the sake of it.

So maybe revenue including sponsors of the Bundesliga should be spread more evenly, but at the same time I wouldn't want to allow every club the exact same budget each season. If one club acts more responsible financially than others then that's part of his competition effort off the pitch - similar to picking the right trainer or talent scout.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/mtxbvs/only_someone_who_truly_hates_football_can_be/gvw8voo/,Temporary_Meat_7792,1619411026

Eh, Hiroshima looks to have had a population of somewhere below 400k and Nagasaki about half that.  I don't think I'd call that ""huge"".  Tokyo, for example, was an order of magnitude larger.  'Course, we also firebombed the blazes out of Tokyo, so I suppose it's kinda six of one, half-a-dozen of the other.

But given that the alternative to bombing was going to be involving sending American soldiers in wirh rifles, with the Japanese government having a strategy to hope to produce maximum casualties and in which even civilians were being instructed to fight, no, I'm pretty comfortable with it.

Japan was a few weeks away from attempting to kick off a biowarfare operation against our own civilian populace when we dropped the bombs, in any event.

1) Unification of Kosovo and Albania. ""In Kosovo, 95 percent of the population wants to unite with the native Albanian nation. The situation is similar in Albania. The border between Albania (a NATO member) and Kosovo is practically non-existent. The Serb part of Kosovo would get a special status - following the example South Tyrol, ""the document states. It is an autonomous province in the north of Italy, where the majority of the population is German-speaking.

2) The unification of most of the territory of Republika Srpska with Serbia. ""The Serbian national question can be largely resolved by annexing part of the Republika Srpska to Serbia. In this case, Serbia is ready to agree to the unification of Kosovo and Albania,"" the document reads.

3) ""The Croatian national question can be resolved by merging the majority Croatian cantons in BiH with Croatia or by granting a special status to the Croatian part of BiH (using the model of South Tyrol).""

1655,"&gt;Look in the context, my statement was that there is nothing to cheer about. Then a guy comes and states ""but there are worse countries!""

I think the context is your original comment saying the EU needs to compare itself to the USA. Remarking that this comparison isn't exactly equivalent isn't wrong. US gdp per capita is near double the EU gdp per capita. And it used its full economic potential on an America first policy. This matters.

I won't defend others viewpoint that the Australian-EU situation is comparable but your own argument is similarly flawed imo. Both AZ really fucking up supply and EU solidarity are meaningful factors in the outcome. I agree with what you say about the post-corona crisis hitting us hard but it is questionable whether unmitigated disaster is accurate. The real disaster would then have been our initial failure to get the disease under control since that is the real cause of impact. 

Bulgaria, the worst performing EU member by far, still had ~10% vaccination rate. Brazil is at 3%. They are economically not that far apart. Romania is at 15%.

The main thing being cheered on here is solidarity. I feel like you overlook the meaning of that. It isn't self evident for Europe to be so. We aren't unified the way the USA is.

&gt;WHO thinks its unacceptable too so.... why cheer on an unmitigated disaster.

Besides, recognizing a genocide is no small thing. You don't just go ""this is a genocide!"" and fuck off afterwards. By international law, if a genocide is happening anywhere in the world all countries have a duty to stop it (crudely phrased). So if Germany were to officially recognize the Uygur genocide in Xinjiang, then it can be legally held liable if it doesn't actively try to end it.

I'm not saying I don't agree with recognizing the Armenian genocide, in fact I do. I just wanted to shed some light on the complexities behind such a move.

1721,"&gt;Many years ago I married into a family of the French working-class. They came from Aveyron, La France Profonde, and most were dyed-in-the-wool socialists. But at a barbecue in the summer of 2002 one, Fabien, admitted that he had cast his ballot for Jean-Marie Le Pen in the recent election. A quarrel ensued but the young man stood his ground. His car had been broken into three times in a matter of months and the police in Marseille had shown no interest. Voting for Le Pen was Fabien's protest at the police indifference to petty crime.

&gt;Twenty years later and it is no longer unusual to discover young people who vote for Le Pen’s daughter, Marine. A poll this month revealed that 29 per cent of 25 to 34 year-olds intend to vote for her party, an increase of 6 per cent on those who backed her at the 2017 election. According to the poll, only 20 per cent of this demographic will vote for Emmanuel Macron, a drop of 9 per cent from the election four years ago. In contrast, the 18-24 age group are more supportive of Macron (29 per cent) and less enamoured of Marine Le Pen (20 per cent).

&gt;There are several reasons to explain this discrepancy. This younger generation are more 'woke' than their elders, and identity politics has taken root in French universities only recently. They have also been less exposed to Islamic terrorism than the 25 to 34 age group, who saw their friends slaughtered in 2015 and 2016. They were on the frontline of the 'war' with Islamic extremism, and they are also disillusioned economically with a president who came to power promising much but who has delivered little in the last four years.

&gt;Macron's opponents accuse him of presiding over a country that is slipping into anarchy

&gt;According to the polling company that conducted the recent survey, only one in five young people voted in the two rounds of the 2017 presidential election, but one in two declare that they will have their say next year.

&gt;This could be decisive in determining the victor of the election. So, too, will the constant drip of violent incidents relayed in the media. On Monday, for example, a Sudanese national was jailed for four years for a series of assaults on women in the city of Clermont, while at the weekend footage went viral of a man pushing a woman down the stairs of a metro station. Marlène Schiappa, the Minister for Citizenship, tweeted her outrage at the clip. The assault coincided with Schiappa's admission that some districts of Paris are ‘dangerous’ for women and her promise to make them safer.

&gt;Schiappa has done her best to stem the verbal and physical assaults committed against young women – in 2018 she introduced an anti-sexual harassment law that netted 700 fines in its first year – but the violent attacks haven't stopped. Sexual violence against women rose by 19 per cent in 2018 and 12 per cent the following year. It continued unabated in 2020 with one of the most high-profile cases that of a young woman who was assaulted by an 18-year-old man because he judged her skirt to be ‘too short’.

&gt;Andréa Kotarac, who is representing Le Pen's National Rally in June's regional elections, explained in an interview why he was not surprised to learn that his leader appeals to the young. ‘She is close to their reality,’ he said. ‘The street has become a danger in our country. That affects the young, notably young women, and we have a left who deny this reality.’

&gt;In its report of the growing support among the young for Marine Le Pen the left-wing newspaper Le Monde blamed it in part on the ignorance of this demographic about her father, Jean-Marie. But there are few ideological similarities between the pair. She has worked hard to de-demonise her party, but above all her manifesto – as Kotarac stated – strikes a chord with the young. Le Monde asked three young voters why they supported Le Pen and their reasons were immigration, security, cultural insecurity and ‘fractures identitaires.’

&gt;According to the political scientist Jean-Yves Camus, there is a correlation between those who vote for Le Pen and their ‘level of income and diplomas’. But it would be a fallacy – as it was with Brexit – to imagine that only the working class vote for what the chattering classes consider beyond the pale. I recall a conversation I had on a train a few months before the 2017 election; my fellow passenger was a director of human resources in an international company in Paris, and she had no inhibition in telling me that she would be voting for Le Pen for the sake of her teenage daughters, for whom she increasingly feared.

&gt;This week Macron visited Montpellier to reassure voters that he understands their concerns about the growing lawlessness. His arrival coincided with the attempted murder of a pedestrian, shot twice in the chest and once in the back just up the road from the president's walkabout. Macron has said 10,000 more police officers will be recruited in the next 12 months but his opponents accuse him of presiding over a country that is slipping into anarchy. ‘The president of chaos, of violence everywhere, all the time, of division, of social, fiscal and territorial injustice, is now selling us the peaceful life,’ said Marine Le Pen.

&gt;The young seem to be siding with Le Pen's pessimism and not Macron's optimism that law and order will soon be restored to French streets.",,/r/europe/comments/myj361/why_so_many_millenials_are_backing_marine_le_pen/gvv6ika/,HaonDoTriDale,1619389217

1770,"&gt;Nuclear energy is expensive. Even though the opposite is often claimed by it's proponents, nuclear energy is one of the most expensive forms of energy. Nuclear Power plants are massively expensive building projects that frequently overrun their initial cost estimates. Look at Finlands Olkiluoto plant or the UK's Hinkley Point. The British government had to guarantee 30 years of above market rate prices for it's electricity to even find investors.

boy they will be suprised once they find out that cost of renewables will skyrocket once you make it main source of your energy, its renewables themselves that are the problem, is the energy storage most of energy storage is based lithium and there is not much of it on earth, cost was coming down because there was rush to mine lithium but it will reverse once more and more countries decide to go renewables + energy storage, in such situation lithium wont last even 50 years. 
Of course there are other types of energy storage like pumped water or compressed-air energy storage, but those types of energy storage are very expensive to build and are very dependent on location.

&gt;Nuclear Power take to long to build. They are massively complex industrial installations after all. 10 years for a new plant is on the shorter end of the spectrum. And that doesn't even include the missed deadlines common to these projects. We need clean energy now, not in 20 years.

Only five years actually in countries who didnt abandon nuclear and didnt lose expertise.

 &gt;No place to store nuclear waste. A couple decades ago, (West) Germany designated an old salt mine as a nuclear waste storage facility. The decision was made for entirely political reasons and against the warning of geologists. Turns out the site is unsuitable after all and needs to be cleared now. So a new site has to be found. But, just as no one wants a nuclear power plant in their neighborhood, no one wants a nuclear waste storage facility either.

1977,"&gt;Nope Nazis saw the Jews as Degenrate blood. (1935 race laws). Also Holocaust isn't comparible, because it was the first and only industrial genocide ever.

Two things can be right at the same time. The fact that Nazis saw Jews as ""degenerate blood"" doesnt negate the fact that one of the primary drives behind the Holocoust was the ""Jews control the world"" trope.

&gt;Officially the Armenians were deported by the ottoman Government, because they sided with the Russian. 

""Officially"" being the key word here. We (People who are the descendants of eyewitnesses to the Armenian Genocide) know many Armenians didn't even reach Syria. And sending an ethnic group on a death march is still a genocide. Having gas chambers is not a prerequisite for genocide.

&gt;Second not all Armenians were deported, only orthodox, Catholic and Protestant Armenians were exclude

Armenians of Ankara were killed as well and they were Catholics. Some protestant Armenians were spared due to the efforts of Protestant establishments, not because of the Three Twats.

&gt;it was also not carried out only by Turks, but Kurds and other muslim groups.

Also, people always come with ""other technologies"", but what other technology are there? Do you want to power the entire world with only wind, hydropower and solar energy? How would this be possible especially with the entire population growing, getting wealthier, buying electric vehicles, etc. What if there's no wind or no sun? How do you want to solve this? Fusion energy is the best thing the world can research on with how revolutionary it would be for the entire world. All good if Germany doesn't want it, but don't stop the research when it could help the entire world fight climate change. The world won't stop researching on fusion energy just because Germany stops.

In the end, Germany will be the loser either way if it fails or succeeds.

2089,"&gt; Dehumanization, humiliation and oppression of unbelievers is a teaching of Islam and a major part of Islamist ideology. In the case of mass murder, it is allowed and in the case of hadith - advocated in the case of the unbelievers attacking the believers - which is an inevitability if the Muslims are taking over the unbelievers and treating them in the way outlined in Islamist ideology.

No, there is no teaching in Islam that tells us to kill unbelievers for their lack of faith, fighting their states and combatant soldiers while protecting the rest under Jizya is, and it's not different to how any civilization functions. Something not specific to Islam.

&gt; Therefore the combination of Imperialism + Islamism inevitably brings upon genocide. Also the lines between the two are blurred, as I said Imperialism needs a racist ideology and also Islamism advocates imperialist action.

For more than a thousand years these Islamic empires didn't mass kill religious minorities, infact when Christians were ethnically cleansing the Jewish populations in Spain they did seek refuge in the Islamic Ottoman empire.

&gt; as I said Imperialism needs a racist ideology and also Islamism advocates imperialist action.

Islam is the only ancient major world religion which has a clear anti-racist stance, hence why you can't even have Arab or Turkic nationalism under any ""Islamist"" ideology.
 
&gt; They are long gone now, the same is true for Egypt and the Levant that you mentioned. Spain was a matter of time. Islamist ideology does not protect different faiths, it humiliates and oppresses unbelievers with the aim to islamize them over time while erasing their previous culture and beliefs - this aim is by definition genocidal, it's just a slow version.

No they aren't long gone they still exist to this day and they have never suffered a genocide, the conversion of Islam that made Christians become a minority took half a millennia while conversion to Christianity in newly conquered christian lands wouldn't take a decade.

&gt; What is not PR is the clear end result of the TYT (and Ottomans) which was the purging of all of the non-muslims to achieve what's essentially a 100% Muslim state. Or do you suppose it's a coincidence that the all the unbelievers were purged?

That's irrelevant to the point, what we know for a **fact** is that the party which dragged the empire into this war was a westernized secular nationalist party which also led the massacre against the Armenians. these were not ""Islamist"" like you claimed.

&gt; It is the ideology that they carried at the time

Secondly, the triple alliance was a defensive alliance, so it was actually Austria - Hungary that broke the terms of the alliance by declaring war on Serbia.

But how to have a more ""equal"" trade deal?

Many of the African imports don't meet the strict EU quality standards.

Also the volume of cheap Chinese imports, many of them a gross violation of intellectual property and patent laws.
In the 1960s to 80s the textile industry in West Africa was booming, occasionally extenting its influence to East Africa. But the liberalization of the market and the dumping of super cheap Chinese bootleg textile declined this industry.

But now the AU is trying to create a regulation in response of both China's and EU trade.

A dozen ""Cape to Cairo"" (and vice-versa) network of infrastructures to increase the trade flow, along with a stable partnership between the EU and Africa. For better or for worse, Africa has plenty of valuable resources needed for Europe. Promoting the region in such a way that 1) would make migrants think twice before risking a journey that could kill them, 2) make local governments have more priorities in the development of the land than exploitation.

(many nations in the world went to anarchy or dictatorship due to the easy exploitation of resources in the land such as diamonds, oil, gold and so on. That source of wealth is easily rewardable enough to dismantle any democratic institutions. In well developed nations such as in North America, Europe, Japan, South Korea and China, the source of wealth comes mainly from the contributions of highly educated citizens, so a dismantle of these institutions wouldn't be as rewarding and would remove a large portion of those same citizens that are the source of wealth).",,/r/europe/comments/my2dz9/european_countries_failing_human_rights/gvtjb9e/,RexLynxPRT,1619360640

They actually are

But covax is a worldwide program that depends on donations from countries that are producing vaccines. And as long as producing countries haven't reached their own vaccination goals, there just won't be enough doses available for covax.

&gt;Interesting, but isn't the low rate in the Ukraine down to vaccine hesitancy?

No, main reason is that they have barely started vaccination. They signed contract with Pfizer only in April for example. And so far they have received only 700k doses (mostly Covishield).

Would 15 articles be enough, if you ignored the 2nd and 3rd ? There were constant cries that EU vaccination rate is slow and doses sit in warehouses or some percentage of it gets wasted.

I cant provide you the daily data per country but I can provide you with WHO statements confirming it - [WHO](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56600660). Just 3 week old.

([full statement](https://www.euro.who.int/en/media-centre/sections/press-releases/2021/slow-vaccine-roll-out-prolonging-pandemic))

I admit, I checked the data and EU indeed is a major exporter to everywhere - that does not translate into an idea that if he had more we would magically handle manage to speed up the delivery over what we have now. 

We hadr surplus of vaccines and failed to do what WHO stated there (""using every single vial"").

&gt;•The Turkish Cypriot constituent state, would have been integrated to Turkey making United Cyprus Republic (UCR) answerable to Turkey.[9]

&gt;•Turkey was granted rights to interfere with the Treaty between Egypt and the Republic of Cyprus on the Delimitation of the Exclusive Economic Zone. Cyprus' rights to its Continental Shelf in the south would have also been answerable to Turkey.[9]

&gt;•Turkey was granted the right of stationing Turkish troops on the island of Cyprus perpetually, again making full independence impossible.[9]

&gt;•The Ethnic groups in Cyprus are Greek 77%, Turkish 18%, other 5% of the population. (2001) The Annan plan equates the representation of the two major ethnic groups in the proposed Senate and in the Supreme Court giving 50-50 representation to the two communities. The majority becomes a minority in important decision centres.[10]

&gt;•The plan created a confederation even though it utilised the term ""federation"" because there was no hierarchy of laws, while central authority emanated from the so-called component states. Note that the United States abandoned its original confederal structure because it was unworkable. In 1789, a federal constitution was established containing a clear federal supremacy clause. The Supreme Court composed of equal numbers of Greek Cypriot (77% of population) and Turkish Cypriot judges (18% of population), plus three foreign judges; thus foreign actors would cast deciding votes.[11]

&gt;•The Plan did not include a settlement regarding the repatriation of Turkish settlers living on Greek Cypriot owned land in Northern Cyprus, while after 19 years, the possibility of abolishing the derogation of 5% of Greeks and Turkish citizens who could settle in Cyprus, is obvious, and the danger of a permanent mass settling of Cyprus by Turkey is visible.
Nearly all the Turkish settlers would be granted citizenship or residence rights leading to citizenship. The central government would have limited control towards future Turkish Immigration. Those settlers opting to return to Turkey would be compensated by Cyprus and Greek Cypriots. Even though Turkey systematically brought in the settlers to alter the demography of the island, it had no responsibility for their Repatriation.

&gt;•The Plan simply disregarded the plain language and clear meaning of the Geneva Convention of 1949, section III, article 49, which prohibits colonisation by an occupying power. Article 49 states in its last paragraph: ""The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.""

&gt;•The Plan did not deal in full with the issue of demilitarisation of the legally invalid 'TRNC', and Greek Cypriots felt they had no reason to believe Turkish promises concerning the withdrawal of troops.
Cyprus would be excluded from the European Common Defense and Foreign Policy, while Turkish troops would remain in Cyprus even after the accession of Turkey to the EU with intervention rights, (a military invasion - occasionally used euphemistically), in the future Greek Cypriot component state.

&gt;•Many Greek Cypriots interpreted the Right of Return policy as seriously flawed, meaning only 20% of Greek Cypriot refugees would be able to return over a time frame of 25 years, whereas Turkish Cypriots would have had full right of return. The plan denied to all Cypriots rights enjoyed by all other EU citizens (right of free movement and residence, the right to apply to work in any position (including national civil services, the right to vote).[12]

&gt;•Turkish Cypriots would have gained all their requested demands in the 24 hours following the referendum, had the plan been accepted. Greek Cypriot demands, however, were relegated to the long term - as well as being dependent on the good will of Turkey to fulfil its obligations.

&gt;•The return of the Turkish occupied land will take place in the period between three and a half months and three and a half years from the moment the solution is signed with no guarantees whatsoever that this shall be implemented. The Cypriot-Greek proposal of placing these areas under the control of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and not the Turkish army has been rejected.

&gt;•The Plan did not address the issue of the British Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs) on the island, although parts of the SBAs would be transferred to the governments of the two constituent states.
The British were granted rights to unilaterally define the continental shelf and territorial waters along two base areas and to claim potential mineral rights. Under the 1959-1960 Zürich and London Agreements, Britain did not have such rights (see the 2nd annex to the Additional Protocol to the 1959 Treaty of Establishment).

&gt;•The plan absolved Turkey of all responsibility for its invasion of Cyprus and its murders, rapes, destruction of property and churches, looting and forcing approximately 200,000 Greek Cypriots from their homes and property. The Cyprus government filed applications to the European Commission on Human Rights on September 17, 1974 and on March 21, 1975. The Commission issued its report on the charges made in the two applications on July 10, 1976.

My only problem is that there isn't a platform in Worldwide political consciousness regarding what Turks (and other ethnic groups, including Christian on Christian violence) went through during the breakdown of the Ottoman Empire. 

The Ottoman Empire went from a land with diverse demographics across it, to successor states with neatly drawn borders and set monogamous ethno-national identities within each of those newly drawn borders, to the detriment of ethnic groups and religious groups who didn't fit the new ""normal"" identities. 

We don't have a consciousness about remembering our own history. Many, many Turks (some estimates say as many as 1/4) are descended from Turks and non-Turkish Muslims who migrated from the Balkans, Aegean Islands, Crimea and Caucasus (including what is now Armenia) because events similar to the Armenian genocide happened to them. 

Perhaps this is partly something purposefully not encouraged by the Turkish State, because it would mean we have to open up about the Armenian Genocide. 

Anyway my point is, we accept Armenian Genocide...Then what happens to Worldwide conciousness of what our ethnicity went through as the Ottoman Empire collapsed? Does that just not get a place in peoples conciousness? Should Turkey accept the genocide and then demand the countries that cleansed Turks accept those as genocide?

Identity is important. Nobody identifies themselves as the villain. We’re all the good guys in the movie of our life.

So whenever something happens which challenges your identity, this triggers a psychological crisis. You either have to massage the new reality to somehow fit into your head, ignore it or, most unpleasantly - accept it. I can understand all three choices.

I’m Serbian, we have some rather nasty stuff in our recent history, and official government trying to deny/massage facts and to this day drags it’s feet on investigations into war crimes. Some ordinary people like the deniability, which is what they vote for these jokers. 

The righteous David vs Goliath founding myth Croatians have is to dear to them for them to sincerely deal with their own war crimes during the civil war. It can’t be a righteous victory if we did war crimes, can it?

2623,"The guillotine was invented with the specific intention of making capital punishment less painful in accordance with Enlightenment ideals, as previous methods of execution in France had proven to be substantially more painful and prone to error. 

Previous to the French Revolution, similar devices were in use in Scotland, England, and various other European countries, often for the execution of criminals of noble birth. 

In 1789 a French physician and member of the National Assembly named Joseph-Ignace Guillotin was instrumental in passing a law that required all sentences of death to be carried out by “means of a machine.” 

This was done so that the privilege of execution by decapitation would no longer be confined to the nobles and the process of execution would be as painless as possible. 

After its adoption, the device remained France's standard method of judicial execution until the abolition of capital punishment in 1981. The last person to be executed in France was Hamida Djandoubi, in 1977.

I looked it up and this isn’t true.

In contrast [there were nearly 4 million enslaved Africans on the eve of the Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States#Distribution_of_slaves).

It's not a coincidence that there are groups in brussels that are heavily lobbying to get natural gas included in the list of ""green"" power sources. They also push for blue and yellow hydrogen to be considered ""green"" despite the fact that it is made from natural gas.

Turkish massmurdered so many people due their etnicity, that it was a genocide, regardless what our goverment recognizes or not. It was a genocide even if Biden would not say it aloud.

Saying it aloud is good and these things should be spoken out aloud and with proper names what they are.

Greeks themselves have bloody history as well - whole greek has been built with bloody wars and genocides been done by them. As well what Americans did to the natives - Its very clear example of genocide, no matter how fancy words you put around it.

I remember a story from my grandmother, that there was a political massacre when she was young. People were divided into whites and reds by political opinion, and one day white side executed some plan of theirs and small groups of whites were dispatched to seek out people with inproper political ideas. Her family had lived as farmers for tens of years where they lived and they had no political affiliations. They were simple folk. Even though, it didnt matter, because ”if you are not with us, you must be against us!” So small group of whites came to the small village and they begun to scourge the farms for inproper people. Killed quite many whom they could catch. Luckily my grandmothers father was lucky enouh to escape, but a lot of people were killed and rest whom were captured were taked to concentration camps. 

In total they captured 80 000 people, of which 20 000 were killed or whom died in obscure circumstances. In addition to them who were killed outright when whites were capturing people.

We all got our bloody heritage and its pointless to discuss about semantics if this is genocide and that is not. They all are genocides when they aim and target certain population with intent to kill them all. I certainly dont need UN to make a decision about if this and that was a genocide or not. Its all political bullshit by countries whom dont want to step on others toes.

The rest of your argument is literal bullshit. Those **were** death camps. Because they were designed to kill people and they did, in hundreds of thousands. That's what we call a death camp. 

&gt; every nation did same thing in war times 

Other nations doing it or not doesn't nullify Turkish wrongdoings. If Japan will want to sue USA for it, Japan is free to do it. But it's a whole different story. Not to mention that there was no war between Turks and Armenians in the first place. 

&gt; bro u we’re ottoman citizens , if u help russian invaders ,that affect somethings 

the thing is, we didn't. That's for a starter. The whole ""rebelion' is a lie. Not that it would justify annihillation of almost the whole population if we did. Because if there would be a rebelion, then you should arrest the rebels instead of murdering every single person who was not a Turk. 

Then again, there was no rebelion, so it's just a hypothetical scenario.

No, you really can’t, not without showing a serious lack of knowledge about both conflicts.

&gt; It was due to the consequential decimations done by both sides.

No, it was not. It was largely because the Ottoman government blamed the failure of its army on an Armenian fifth column, when actually the Army was just incompetent. It was not the result of mutual incriminations, but like the Holocaust, it was the result of a “stab-in-the-back” myth. The illusion that Turkey was being victimized by the Armenians was one of the justifications for the genocide, and repeating it shows how that falsehood is still causing pain today.

&gt; the Ottoman government coudln't inhibit it from happening either inadvertently or deliberately

Dude, come on. If you send hundreds of thousands of Armenians on a forced march into the desert, it isn’t an accident if they die.

What do you mean why Turkey should? For the good of humanity and for the Armenians who got killed or had a family member or friend killed. And so that Turkey doesn't ever get led by extremists again (you have a few in Turkey already, and they exist because of lack of acknowledgement of what happened) and commit crimes again. 

It doesn't show weakness, it shows strength to overcome the past and be better than in the past. You could recognize it despite what the West thinks or says. The problem is a regional one, shouldn't be an international one. I fully understand that you don't like that the West doesn't recognize all the shit it did, I wouldn't be happy for others to accuse me when they did just as bad, but it doesn't mean I should be like them.

NATO was created after France and the UK tried putting together an alliance to stop the Soviet Union from overrunning Europe.  That was the [Western Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Union_(alliance\)).

&gt;The Western Union (WU), also referred to as the Brussels Treaty Organisation (BTO),[1] was the European military alliance established between France, the United Kingdom (UK) and the three Benelux countries in September 1948 in order to implement the Treaty of Brussels signed in March the same year.[Note 1] Under this treaty the signatories, referred to as the *five powers*, agreed to collaborate in the defence ﬁeld as well as in the political, economic and cultural ﬁelds. 

-

&gt;When the division of Europe into two opposing camps became unavoidable, the threat of the U.S.S.R. became much more important than the threat of German rearmament. Western Europe, therefore, sought a new mutual defence pact involving the United States, a powerful military force for such an alliance. The United States, concerned with containing the influence of the U.S.S.R., was responsive. Secret meetings began by the end of March 1949 between American, Canadian and British officials to initiate the negotiations that led to the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty on 4 April 1949 in Washington, D.C. 
&gt;
&gt;The need to back up the commitments of the North Atlantic Treaty with appropriate political and military structures led to the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). On 20 December 1950 the Consultative Council of the Brussels Treaty Powers decides to merge the military organisation of the Western Union into NATO.

So at some point an alliance would have (and did) exist.

If you mean that it wouldn't have been called ""NATO"", then sure.  If you mean that it might have been conquered by the Soviet Union in the Cold War era and thus wouldn't exist today, possible.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/mxfghw/members_of_eu_nato/gvqv0e4/,duisThias,1619295746

3268,"&gt;Okay regarding the UN thing I think it is very obvious that Russia and China are the ones holding it back.

They are the most important countries that are holding it back yes, but the other half of the UN not supporting it is important too.

&gt;I’m not saying that the Albania’s would be killed, and I’m not defending the KLA however in a place where the vast majority of people are Albanian and have been oppressed by the Serbs why wouldn’t they seek independence?

I mean a lot of other countries have a big minority living in their country so why dont they get an independence? Why dont Serbs in Bosnia get independence? Its just a double standard

&gt;Hell I even understand the RS independence movement even though those two cannot be compared

They can. In Yugoslavia the Croats got their independence, the Slovenians got theirs, the Bosniaks got theirs, Macedonian theirs and Montenegro theirs, what did the Serbs get? They got ethnic cleansing in Croatia 200 000 were ethnically cleansed and they were forced to reside in Bosnia where they didnt want to live. Everyone got their independence, only Serbs didnt, because it didnt fit the Wests plans for Yugoslavia.

&gt;compared. Serbia has no control over Kosovo, they have their own Parlament their own politicians and president and their own money, how is that not lost exactly? 

Serbia has some control in the northern parts as I already said. And it isnt lost because according to international law it is still a part of Serbia. Their ""government"" will disband as soon as America leaves.

&gt; Historically Kosovo has been a part of Serbia for a long long time but I think it’s time to let it go.

No it is not time to let go and it never will be. Kosovo is where Serbia was created as a country and the birthplace of our religion. The most important battle in the history of Serbia was fought there and etc. We will never give it up.

&gt; Hey at least you still got Vojvodina.

Still got? What do you mean by that? You think we should lose Vojvodina too? We got Vojvodina as war reparations from Austria-Hungary because they invaded us and we defeated them fair and square.

In Serbia, bosnia, montenegro, albania, romania and croatia, i had to try quite literally every variation i could find and i, not even once, got one i didn't like. Ended up being the most memorable and the thing i treasure the most from that experience.

3396,"&gt; The idea of the article is that Russia will increase its supply. The low cost of labour, which reduces the cost of produce, may push other sellers out of the market. 

The supply is global. Russian prices are limited by global ones (and that's a good thing). Anyway   Russia may gain some competitive advantage and  some people might immigrate to Russia to grow food there. But even if that happens those would still be small factors that won't contribute to the Russian economy noticeably. It's questionable whether Russia should even want them. Just about any other direction of economic development would be superior. 

&gt; In the case of Siberia, climate change is not causing fires, as discovered by the study in the BBC article.  

I wasn't aware of that. I'll keep an eye out for such information though I really was under the impression that, even if exaggerated, wildfires are increasing.

This may address fires but that's not the only issue with climate change. Additionally in this thread I've posted another article specifically about the permafrost melting. According to it and a third one I haven't linked a lot of Russian industry in Siberia like oil and gas extraction, mining is threatened by the deforming ground. The article estimates some 100 billion dollars worth of infrastructure could be harmed by these processes. The measures  to deal with  permafrost degradation are estimated to cost between 0.1 and 3% of Russian GDP.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/mxhr27/climate_change_threatens_russia_with_billions_in/gvpfn2a/,ZmeiOtPirin,1619274751

The capitulation of Germany began before the revolution. The mutiny of the sailors, was the consequence of this surrender.

And the land front collapsed, before the Berlin uprising.

And in Russia, first there was a second revolution, and therefore the front has already collapsed. Before that, it was rotting, but it held on.

And this ""rotting"" of the Russian army (like the revolution) was a consequence of Russia's internal problems, even before the military. They made the Russian society weak, which could not stand much less hardships than the German one.

So, Germany and Russia have opposite reasons for losing the war.

Germany completely lost in the military plan, having spent all military and material resources, which broke the German spirit, and then there was an internal turmoil.

And in Russia, the spirit could not stand it, and the turmoil began again, which led to defeat in the war. Although the material resources were still there.

&amp;#x200B;

 We also have several in Russia:  

Suumbike Tower in Kazan:

[http://s4.fotokto.ru/photo/full/574/5748560.jpg](http://s4.fotokto.ru/photo/full/574/5748560.jpg)

Tower in Nevyansk in the Urals. Also in its cellars, the industrialist Demidov minted counterfeit coins in the 18th century.

 Bell tower in Yaroslavl (depicted on the banknote of 1000 rubles)  

[https://sobory.ru/pic/00200/00214\_20181029\_113729.jpg](https://sobory.ru/pic/00200/00214_20181029_113729.jpg)

Etc... 

It is interesting to see how the builders tried to correct the slope of the tower during the construction process if it began to ""fall"" immediately. As a result, the towers turned out to be of an interesting curved shape.  

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. And in conclusion, a favorite anecdote of engineers: 

One priest was building a church. 

And everything would be fine, but the bell tower fell all the time. If they build it, it will fall. If they build it again, it will fall again.

And then an angel of God appeared to the priest and uttered: ""Immerse your wife in the foundation and your Temple will stand for centuries."" The father loved his young wife very much, but he also loved the Lord. And you need to build a temple. He burned, cried, said goodbye to his wife (and she was a god-fearing woman, if God needs it, then it’s so necessary) and still walled it up. 

And the bell tower fell anyway.

What you don't get is that you cannot be sure that letting people drown will make it less likely that others will try to make the crossing. There are hundreds of factors that go into that, like the situation in the regions asylum seekers come from, and the ease with which human traffickers can establish themselves to name a few.

3635,"I think a lot of it had to with how military attaches and theorists tend to look at what the winners in a given conflict did rather than what the losers did. By its nature, trench warfare is defensive and it seems almost inconceivable to win a war on the defensive. 

I recall reading about the Maxim Gun and one thing that a lot of contemporary people did was praise the Japanese military for its elan in the attack and highly motivated soldiers, and talk about how it vindicated the prevailing theory of massed bayonets as an irresistible force in combat. 

* Barbed wire doesn’t seem particularly intimidating at all, especially when most people think of it as the three strands waist high stuff that a person could easily hop over as long as they watched where they put their hands and feet. 

* Trenches had been used before for centuries, and the weaknesses of trenches were already well known- it was difficult to command groups of men larger than a platoon, the entrenched men could not maneuver, and volley fire was difficult to organize so the trench usually lacked in volume of firepower when compared to a unit in open terrain. In the 19th century, a trench without wooden stakes for protection was a prime target to be stormed with a bayonet charge. 

* The Maxim gun on its own wasn’t particularly outstanding; it was worth acquiring but it wasn’t a wonder weapon. It was too heavy for most types of mobile warfare, it couldn’t serve in multiple roles like a cannon since it only fired bullets (versions like the Pom-Pom were even heavier), and its crew would be priority targets as soon as they started firing and the Maxim gun wasn’t known for rapid traverse- they would overwhelmed by charging forces. 

When all of things were combined, they compensated for each other. Barbed wire slowed down attackers so they couldn’t rush a trench, machine guns compensated for normal lack of firepower of a unit inside a trench, and the trench protected the crews of the machine guns.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/mwnxb8/russian_illustrations_depicitng_the_battles/gvntku8/,Kahzootoh,1619252530

&gt;In [the first paper](https://www.cgdev.org/publication/migration-developing-countries-selection-income-elasticity-and-simpsons-paradox), Mendola and I looked at people actively preparing to emigrate from 99 low- and medium-income countries. These are people who are not just hoping or planning to emigrate, but have taken costly steps to prepare for emigration, such as paying for travel. We compare their incomes to the incomes of people who are not preparing to emigrate. We used nationally representative survey data from 653,613 people, collected by the premier [Gallup World Poll](https://www.gallup.com/analytics/232838/world-poll.aspx) between 2010 and 2015.\[...\]  On average, **people with higher incomes are much** ***more*** **likely to be actively preparing to emigrate.** People earning triple the average income in a low-income country (1.1 log points above 0) are about twice as likely to be preparing to emigrate as people earning a third of the average income (1.1 log points below 0).",Italy,/r/europe/comments/mwxis9/more_than_100_asylum_seekers_feared_dead_after/gvnlwgb/,nonsiamouguali,1619245348

3747,"""U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday told Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan that he intends to recognize the 1915 massacres of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as genocide, sources familiar with the conversation told Reuters, a potential further blow to the already frayed ties between the two NATO allies.

The much-anticipated first phone call between the two leaders took place more than three months after Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration, a delay that is widely seen as a cold shoulder to Erdogan, who had enjoyed close ties with former president Donald Trump.

The call was also a day before Armenian Remembrance Day when Biden is expected to break away from decades of carefully calibrated White House statements that had previously described the events during World War One as ""Metz Yeghern"" (great evil).

Neither the White House statement on the phone call nor the account provided by the Turkish presidency made any mention of the issue.

""President Biden spoke today with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, conveying his interest in a constructive bilateral relationship with expanded areas of cooperation and effective management of disagreements,"" the White House said in a statement.

It said the two leaders agreed to meet on the margins of the NATO summit in June to have a wider conversation about their two countries' relations.

Turkey accepts that many Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire were killed in clashes with Ottoman forces during World War One, but contests the figures and denies the killings were systematically orchestrated and constitute a genocide.

A statement from the Turkish presidency said Biden and Erdogan agreed on ""the strategic character of the bilateral relationship and the importance of working together to build greater cooperation on issues of mutual interest.""

Ties between Ankara and Washington have been strained over a host of issues, from Turkey's purchase of Russian S-400 defense systems - over which it was the target of U.S. sanctions - to policy differences in Syria, human rights and legal matters.

Erdogan had established a close bond with Trump, but since Biden took over, Washington has grown more vocal about Turkey's human rights track record. It has also stood firm on its demand that Ankara get rid of the Russian defense systems.""",,/r/europe/comments/mxeasq/biden_told_erdogan_he_plans_to_call_1915/gvnmw3f/,Nomad_Stav,1619246223

3751,"Castle Leod is the seat of the Clan Mackenzie. It is a category A listed building, and the grounds are listed in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes of Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens. It is located near Strathpeffer in the east of Ross-shire in the Scottish Highlands.

The castle was granted to John of Killin, 10th Chief of Clan MacKenzie (1485-1561) after he fought at the Battle of Flodden. The castle was passed to his great-grandson Kenneth Mackenzie, 1st Lord Mackenzie of Kintail, who granted it in 1608 to his brother Sir Roderick ""Rorie"" Mackenzie. In 1605 Sir Roderick married Margaret MacLeod, heiress of Torquil MacLeod of Lewis, bringing her immense wealth into the family and also settling the feud between the MacLeods and the Mackenzies over the Barony of Coigach, which thus passed into the Mackenzie family.

The castle is believed to have been built on the site of a very ancient Pictish fort from before the 12th century. The current castle is the result of work carried out in the early 17th century by Sir Roderick Mackenzie, the ancestor of the Earl of Cromartie. The castle has remained the seat of the Earls of Cromartie ever since.

In the mid 19th century, Castle Leod was completely renovated by the Hay-Mackenzies. Descendants of the 3rd Earl, the Hay-Mackenzies were restored to the earldom of Cromartie when Anne Hay-Mackenzie married George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 3rd Duke of Sutherland in 1861. In 1851 large extensions were added to the north of the castle, which were rebuilt in 1904. The roof was made watertight as recently as 1992. 

The castle remains the home of the Earl of Cromartie, and is open to the public on a limited number of days.",,/r/europe/comments/mxebsv/castle_leod_scotland/gvnmzs6/,atdoru,1619246313

It's also compounded by mistakes made in the EU's approach to vaccine procurement, which was overreliant on the Sanofi vaccine (a program which has failed to produce a working jab) and not so much others. This matters because advance purchasing also provides the investment that manufacturers need to build up plant capacity, therefore in Europe it's mostly a game of catch-up.

4018,"... a source? I mean, this is public knowledge? It's also literally on the company's website. It started in 1984 as a joint venture between Phillips and ASM International (Dutch company founded in the 60's). They became an independent company in 1995.

Another big and succesful Dutch tech company started by Phillips is NXP (spun off in 2006). 

Origin was another Dutch tech company spun-off from the Phillips automatization division (1990); that later merged with two French companies to become the current day Atos.

Then there was also Hollandse Signaalapparaten, a small military electronics company which was bought by Phillips in 1956 and greatly expanded before being sold to a French company 1990, it is now the Netherlands division of Thales (which produces all our fancy naval radar systems among other things).

Phillips also had a Cryogenics division which was spun-off in 1990 and is now Sterling Cryogenics.

Whirlpool became the largest producer of domestic appliances as a result of merging with the the Phillips domestic appliance division, and also eventually sold off by Phillips.

Duphar was a pharmaceutical/chemical subsidiary of Phillips that became a part of Belgian company Solvay, before before split and sold off to different companies. 

And Polygram was the entertainment division of Phillips which got sold off to Seagram; which in turn merged it into Universal Music Group.

&gt; o I mainly hear about large companies buying up start-ups with good ideas, rather than a large company founding a start-up with a good idea

That's the modern corporate paradigm; but Phillips is an old tech giant. People don't know just how much modern technology exists because of Phillips. Back in their glory days they operated a very large R&amp;D division (the kind that could give entire countries a run for their money). The number of (very diverse) technological innovations they're responsible for in part or in full is absolutely staggering. 

Nowadays, when tech companies do r&amp;d, it's purely commercial; very goal oriented. Figuring out a way to make the new ipad slightly 'better' so they can charge more. Old-guard giants like Phillips though, used to just throw money at the kind of science that didn't necessarily have to produce immediate commercial results. Fundamental physics research that *maybe* could be spun into profit. That's how we ended up with things like Casette tapes or CD's. Or even electronic music (basically a Phillips invention); but also countless pure science advancements. 

They also took techs that others had given up on as a dead-end, and continued researching them just in case there was something there. Sterling engines are the best example of this. Nobody was interested in them except Philips. Thanks to the work of Phillips, they're everywhere now.

Philips has been involved with just about any kind of product you can think of at some point during its existence; and either gave up on it or spun it off.",Flevoland (Netherlands),/r/europe/comments/mwstc8/how_old_are_europes_tech_companies/gvmnt5y/,nybbleth,1619223608

4051,"&gt; Bavaria was a de-facto right-wing dictatorship during the Weimar Republic that provided the perfect breeding ground for the Nazi movement.

Here's a map:

https://brilliantmaps.com/nazi-votes/

&gt;Support varied widely across the country. It was highest in the former Prussian territories in the north-east of Germany (with the exception of Berlin) and much weaker in the west and south of the country, which had, up until 1871, been independent German states.

Bavaria doesn't look to really be the core of Nazi support.  Bavaria is the south-east.  I guess it overlaps with Franken, which had high support, but also with Niederbayern, which had low support.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany

If I recall my history classes correctly, within those, it was more rural areas that saw Nazi support — farmers resenting growing wealth in cities.

*googles*

Yeah.

https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/central-european-history/article/abs/nazi-partys-rural-propaganda-before-1928/B34317139B35A3B365298F38D67C403A

&gt;As early as 1928, the Nazi party could rely on rural strongholds, ranging from Schleswig-Holstein to Baden. The party received particularly firm support from small and medium-sized Protestant farmers. By July 1932 the NSDAP won over fifty percent of the popular vote, not only in the province of Schleswig-Holstein but also in many smaller rural Protestant electoral districts in Germany. Most historians have attributed this rural electoral swing to the NSDAP to a combination of factors which usually include the deterioration of the farmer's economic position, the farmer's alienation from the “Weimar System,” and the Nazi party's antiurban propaganda which appealed to “certain deep-seated resentments and sentiments.”",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/mwygmr/a_luftschutzbunker_air_raid_shelter_still/gvmotc9/,duisThias,1619224153

Some early 20th-century ""Polish jokes"" may have been told originally before World War II in disputed border regions such as Silesia, suggesting that Polish jokes did not originate in Nazi Germany but rather much earlier as an outgrowth of regional jokes rooted in historical discrimination of Poles in German-ruled areas, at least from the 18th-century Partitions of Poland, and actively pursued from the end of the 19th century by the government-backed German Eastern Marches Society, resulting in social class differences.[3] Nonetheless, these jokes were later fuelled by ethnic slurs disseminated by German warlords and National Socialist propaganda that attempted to justify Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles by representing Poles as dirty and relegating them as inferior on the basis of their not being German.[4][5]",,/r/europe/comments/mwpekb/pisa_results_snapshot_of_students_performance_in/gvlueec/,redwhiterosemoon,1619208977

Its nothing to do with boasting... its a literal fact. Hollyrood has legislative powers over everything from policing, health and taxes to even the electoral system and a range of fiscal powers. The only reserved powers the UK government holds over them is basically import duties, foreign policy, international relations and immigration. It has far more power than a German Lander for example, and only US states and the Swiss cantons can be argued that they have more devolved power.

4309,"&gt;Maybe a lot of this can simply be attributed to xenophobia and racism still being a thing in Britain, you know.

I never said xenophobia and racism are not a thing in Britain. I said that we have a longer history of immigration and fewer of the issues around assimilation than our European counterparts do.

&gt;They still get 3 to 4 times as much support as an AfD gets in Germany  and have more support than the center right + right in Germany combined.

Yes, because they aren't literally Nazi remnants.

&gt;but ""more"" left wing (compared to other European leaders - that was your  own words, I was just too lazy to type the whole sentence on my phone  because I thought you know what I'm referring to).

You are paraphrasing yet again. What I said was that Boris is more left wing than other right-wing European leaders solely on the topic of immigration. As far as rugged capitalism goes, we're well to the right of anyone in Europe.

&gt;Interestingly enough, a certain (admittedly small) percentage of the refugees since 2015 that are consistently blocked from entering the UK... are from Pakistan

Yeah I mean, we are definitely awful about ""having the right papers"", on par with the US on this count. Pakistanis do still move in fairly large numbers to the UK.

&gt; but ultimately a much more benign and accepting immigration policy than the tone would suggest.

Intriguing theory, I'll give you that. I did even once believe this, but moving around the EU generally made me a lot more jaded about this. Here's a proxy example, for what it's worth - [black people](https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/fra-2019-being-black-in-the-eu-summary_en.pdf) feel less discriminated against (and face fewer racist incidents) in the UK than anywhere in the EU.

and again... im not saying turkey never did anything bad. im not saying ataturk was as pure as a dove. but even when you write a thousand words on it, ""official denial for Kurdish existence triggered the Kurdish nationalism "" is an oversimplification. the kurdish nationalism was already there, like every other nation's nationalism was there.

4366,"Hey! Since you edited your reaction, I'd like to let you know that this has always been our mindset. From the moment our country was founded, we've been like this (thanks to Atatürk and his revolution). Erdoğan never won elections because of an anti-western mindset. He's a conservative but heavily promoted gay marriage, freedom of speech, democracy, EU membership, etc. Ofc everything he said was a lie. His lies were uncovered year after year as he acts like himself (an authoritarian conservative) when there is no election in sight. He only played games to stay in charge by making people fear change and promising big each time. He won his first election at 32% because the opposition party split, so he's really never had an honest win.

You should come visit! We Turks are very diverse people among ourselves. You'll see young couples drinking wine by the Galata tower while some old folks make their way to the mosque. Go to Beşiktaş or Kadıköy and you'll see it's really safe, young men and women don't sleep and have an amazing night life! Go to the old-Town and you'll see traditional historic mosques, bazaars and a lot of amazing history. We've always been a Muslim majority country of 'European values' like Bosnia and Albania. We have our uniqueness and certainly a lot to offer. There are weird stereotypes about us being dark and middle eastern which I find weird because we're very diverse I'm pale af &amp; blonde, so is my mum and my dad is tanned. No clue where these come from. But I'd suggest you see Istanbul for a great big city, Izmir or Antalya (or any Aegan/Mediterranean cities) for great beaches and history!

Yeah and to do that the people who pollute most (so us Westerners) should start by reducing OUR  carbon foot print. At the same time developing countries should find solution to develop themselves without reaching our per capita emission otherwise we are doomed.

4577,"&gt;Its a nice example, the whole car and license thing but that doesnt take away from the fact that you are still basically calling half of 85 million people morons for voting on him.

Because they are. Anyone who votes for anyone because they align with their own measle beliefs is a moron. Period. Plus, last time we had an election, there were around 55 million voters. You are including literal babies and the people who just didn't vote too.

&gt;Democracy in its purest form is to let the country vote on whoever they want.

That's the thing, democracy is just idiocracy. The decision-making of the nation is just as powerful as the number of the people who can make reasonable choices. It's so fucking flawed. Democracy makes it a reasonable and respectable choice if a nation votes on nuking itself.

&gt;You can't claim Democracy is the way to go

Never did.

&gt;Theyve voted for open racist parties to win for Gods sake.

Yes. Fucking morons.

&gt;See, your saying all this all the while you have not given a proper answer to why people vote for him.

It is a proper answer. Just take a look at Erdogan's speeches before his first election. He speaks of religion and religion only. He speaks of how he's going to make ir better for the religion and dispersed social aids even back then. It's not a proper answer just because you disagree.

&gt;The dominant ideology and culture wins in a country, how is this hard to grasp?

Being dominant doesn't make you right or any less moronic.

&gt;If its like your saying, that somehow people are getting ""woke"" (wich all his opposers has said since his been leading), then Erdogan wont get elected, Turkey is a democracy.

I didn't say that?? Do not put words in my mouth. The fate of my children and the well-being of my nation is far too important for me to trust in the system which brought Erdogan to power and kept him there.

&gt;You cant classify religious people as morons because they vote for him being religious, religion is just a name of an ideology he follows.

I can and I just did. Anyone who votes for Erdogan just because he's a good muslim is an utter fucking moron. Being a good muslim doesn't make anyone a good leader.

&gt;religion is just a name of an ideology he follows. People knows what Islam values and lifestyle brings and votes for him.

That's the thing. Religion should never become an ideology. If it does, then it becomes extreme and exclusive. ISIS is the prime example of what a religion turns into if it becomes an ideology.

&gt;All of the west is focused on Turkey, as it has been for hundreds of years and the reason is not Erdogan.

So? Do you think a weakling opportunist like Erdogan can manage to do anything if Turkey were to be invaded by the said evil westerners? The most recent time when the Turks had to take up arms to fight for their survival was back in 1974, for the liberation of Cypriot Turks. It was done by the ""ignorant elitist kemalists"" and nothing but peace has ensued for the Turkish Cypriots ever since. That date also marked the birth of the Turkish defense industries. In comparison, Erdogan is unable to stop the forming of a terrorist state in Syria out of fear for Americans and has not created any national institutions that has added value to the accumulation of the Republic of Turkey. He instead even sold them. The tank tracks factory of the Turkish army has been privatized. Not even Tengri knows whether this foreign partnered company will be able to deliver the army what it needa during a time of imminent need.

&gt;They tried a coup for Gods sake, The west was building the whole thing way before AKP even was a thing. If you cant see the focus Turkey has from the West and still somehow think this whole ""radicalization"" is Erdogans own doing, you are giving him waaay to much credit.

Fethullahist Terror Organization was the main culprit of that coup attempt and they were never able to gain any position of power due to the Kemalist dominance UNTIL Erdogan's management came and jailed all of the Kemalists with the false accusations preparing a coup against him. The same people he supported against the Kemalists while being overjoyed from seeing getting them jailed and dishonoured were the ones who staged a coup against him. You are so uninformed about how everything actually went down. Erdogan used to make pleas to Fethullah and declare his longing for him. The radicalization and all are the direct result of Erdogan removing what kept these people down and bolstered them with the hopes of establishing a permanent anti-Kemalist tradition. It all backfires on him and now he and his blind supporters are bitching about how America used these treacherous and opportunist groups against him. You are giving Erdogan waaaay too less credit.

&gt;Finally, Democracy doenst only apply when you like it, I know some CHP followers have a hard time understanding this seeing they deem themselves Gods gift to the moronic society of Turkey.

I'm not a CHP supporter. It doesn't automatically make me a CHP-ist if I'm anti-Erodgan. However, I would take CHP over Erdogan any day if such a choice was given. I wish to see Turkey defending what is best for Turkey not for our inferior, treacherous muslim neighbours.

&gt;Also theyve never won with pure voting.

4640,"Its incredibly interesting to look at Turkey voting data from naturals in foreign countries. Turks in Germany and Netherlands always vote right-wing while those in UK and US vote left-wing or liberal. I think this is because first, Turkish nationals in Germany and NL are mostly from rural areas of Turkey, and are low-educated low-wage laborers; however Turks in US and UK are mostly better educated “expats” that integrated better to their destination countries. Further, Turks in Germany and NL are faced with more “anti-Turkish anti-Muslim” sentiment and Erdogan’s adverserial stance against Europe is more attractive to them. 

Inside Turkey, Erdogan has a surprisingly low share of votes in younger age groups. It was somewhere around 20-25% in 25 and under for example. But in older generations, especially in smaller cities accross Anatolia where access to internet is much lower and in low-income neighborhoods in big cities, Erdogan has very high support ratings. Erdogan dominates conventional media and TV, which is almost thr only mode of news for these people. In addition, Erdogan plays off of their fears incredibly well with constant mentions of terrorism, instability, economic crisis, multiparty governments, and so on. 

As a young Turk, I find myself blaming the opposition and EU a lot. EU has consistently turned a blind eye to Turkey’s descent into further authoritarianism and both the EU and the opposition parties have shown no interest in any communication. Erdogan found a lot support from US and EU before he came to power, yet the current opposition has never sought such support nor the US or EU has shown even the slightest bit of that to any opposition party. EU especially is still viewed fairly positively in Turkey and accession talks mean a lot, even though most know its just not possible anymore. EU could still do a lot to support the opposition against Erdogan but they are clearly okay with him as long as he keeps the borders closed and doesn’t allow 4 million Syrians into Europe.",,/r/europe/comments/mwgx18/what_a_beautiful_freedom_of_expression/gvk45np/,CLiberte,1619180532

Well not your extreme example, since I don't know a country where murder isn't illegal.

But yes, if extreme right wing parties gain popularity and people vote for people that want to abolish islam for example. Then if that party wins, they will probably pass a law that abolishes islam and at that point it is legal for islam to be forbidden (I don't know what you mean by legitimate, I don't think it would be right, but that is not what we are talking about).

But again quite an extreme example, since religious freedom is usually part of the constitution, which can be hard to rewrite (although definitely not impossible, it might just take more time).

4814,"&gt; moral, cultural and spiritual decline

* Moral: Gender roles and the nuclear family were a necessity for thousands of years as peasants didn't have the luxury to maybe not procreate. (Of course, they were never respected by the power elite.) The difference is that today for the first time in history there are too many people instead of too few, so now there is space for people to indulge in their paraphilia without harming their community.

* Cultural: Culture has always belonged to those rich enough to not have to worry about making ends meet, and served to set them apart from the rabble. Now that anyone can participate in creating art or establishing a group culture (eg. memes), it is devalued. To which I say, _oh noes_.

* Spiritual: Been in decline since the early Middle Ages in much of the West. Or perhaps you mean the foreign desert religion worshipping a Semitic war deity that's been imposed on the West because it was useful for nobility to be able to claim their rule was supported by the king of kings as they put peasants' heads on stakes?

The _actual_ decline that matters is loss of entrepreneurial spirit and will to succeed and change the world. It exists in the US (partly because of how screwed you are if you don't make it) and China (because they remember what the bad times looked like) but is lost in Europe where individuals beg for governments to protect them against themselves and countries don't want to spend a few million on securing more vaccines that might not work out.",European Alliance of Nations,/r/europe/comments/mwf006/china_is_betting_that_the_west_is_in_irreversible/gvjmo82/,EnaiSiaion,1619165908

4818,"&gt; That's why I think it's more reasonable the Danish keyboard is also used in Norway instead of having different ones.

Since Denmark has gone against Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany, Austria, Estonia and Switzerland; which all follows the pattern of ""K L Ö Ä"", using the Danish/Faroese order of ""K L Ä Ö"" makes less sense. If we're going to reduce the number of variants and unify keyboards, we should rather go with what is more popular and not what is less popular. That is, not the Danish version.

&gt; There's little reason for Denmark and Norway to have Ä and Ö (or Ü) printed on them as you can simply use the umlaut (¨) on any key.

Sure, you technically don't need to press Alt Gr + Ø/Æ since you can press ¨ + O/A. But using Alt Gr could be quicker. But having both options does not cause any harm.

&gt; Also since Denmark and Norway adopted the Swedish Å, wouldn't it make sense the Sweden adopted the Æ and Ø from Denmark and Norway (as well as the alphabetic order)?

Why not the reverse? Sweden and Finland share alphabet, so the 11,4 million Danish, Norwegian and Faroese speakers can instead change their alphabet to the one that 19,0 million Swedish and Finnish speakers use. And as pointed out before, Germany and Estonia are also using Ö Ä, and there are many more languages like Sami, Hungarian, Turkish and more that also use Ö. Not even Icelandic uses Ø and instead Ö (but they do use Æ), it's a rare letter with little use and should rather be abandoned. So if Ø is abandoned, so should Æ. Iceland can also replace Æ with Ä.

In addition to their physical strength, some of them are masters of sorcery, overcoming their enemies with magic.[7]

5109,"okay, Turkish here.  
let me explain everything, at least in my perspective.  
Erdogan was a man who was laughing actually from inside. he was energetic. look at GDP of Turkey per year, he caused a huge increase. %450 increase in GDP just in 10 years. he was running for top 10 largest economy of the world and he was actually going pretty good. until 2014. you will see the fall right in there.  
I think, a psychology in his mind just started to appear. after controlling the state that much years and causing actually good things, he just started to think that whole country and state is owned by himself.  
people noticed that but they still believed in him, they wanted to. they didn't want to see the fact that he fucked up meanwhile he was just going greatly. he was their only hopes. he made a referandum about passing to presidental system, which would damage the Turkish democracy a lot. it passed. whole country is of himself in his mind.  
He started to not to care about country, because why would he?   
He had lots of adulatories near to him. they made him think that he is the superior person and a glorious leader. He literally started to spend state's money for himself, because why wouldn't he? state is of him!   
people started to hate him. lots of people see his corruption and cheating on elections. he also noticed that he fucked everything up. he lost his energy. he just started to think like ""huh, everything is fucked up, so why wouldn't I care only about myself but not the country?"" he is sad and his sadness force him to make corruption and stealing state more and more everyday. He lost all his hopes. now he doesn't knows what to do.  
history will write him as a person who started as going good but then fucked everything up and died as a person who did corruption and created a dictatorship. Maybe some of us will be sad for him, some of us will curse him (I am the second one absolutely) but the common thing we have to do as Turkish nation is: taking a lesson from that. I hope Turkey earns a bright future.

This part scares me. Not because of China, but because of this western idea that democracy doesn't matter if you're ""right"". As if democracy is only a thing as long as you agree with the outcome and the moment you don't it's apparently fine to ditch it.

China is right. They aren't exporting their values. And as a communist I don't like that, I wish they do but they don't. What they expect is that each country is respected and that nobody uses their military power or economic sanctions to control others.

What is more interesting than China's fall and rise in the 19th century (Opium wars between UK/US and France VS China) is the fall of the US and W-Europe. Just [five years ago](https://www.oecd.org/sdd/prices-ppp/oecd-share-in-world-gdp-stable-at-around-50-per-cent-in-ppp-terms-in-2017.htm) we had a 'historic' moment where the OECD made out less than 50 percent of the world's GDP in PPP. And the US' share of the world GDP which used to be above 20% will soon go to around 14% as poorer countries become richer. The EU follows the same progress.

China, which was at 10% when the financial crisis hit, is aimed to be around 20% in just a couple of years. 

A country like Kenya tripled in their share of world GDP. All of these countries are slowly chipping away at the global power the US and West Europe have always had thanks to their economies. 

These changes and how we deal with them will really determine our future. I just hope we can solve this peacefully, because those Opium Wars were terrible and I am sure that won't be possible again.",,/r/europe/comments/mwf006/china_is_betting_that_the_west_is_in_irreversible/gvhz6hg/,Kobaxi16,1619130137

5385,"Actually if the Afghans fought extremism by rounding up extremists and sending them to re-education camps for brainwashing for a few months, and were incredibly successful at it, like the Chinese are, that would be great. Instead, western countries and the Afghan government wage a hot war against them and regularly bomb weddings. The death toll is in the hundreds of thousands already. In Xinjiang, there is no death toll. Extremists go through the system and come out as productive citizens, instead of suicide bombers. Brainwashing works. Clearly this way is far more humane than how we fight terrorism. Afghanistan is one of the worst places in the world to live, as are all the other regions that were ""blessed"" by our way of fighting terrorism. Meanwhile, Xinjiang is a rapidly developing region that puts to shame all of its neighbors.

I witnessed a leftist demonstration in Bordeaux a month or two ago, to commemorate the Paris Commune. Some beautiful blonde girl was dancing as part of the demonstration. Two guys, in their early thirties, were passing by and they spit on her, implying she was a whore. They probably weren't called François. It was a quick affair and they left as fast as they came. I don't know why people were shocked, that's what leftist politics got us in France. That's the result we have to deal with now every fucking day. Now we're stuck with this problem and it's probably too late to change it.

Of course we shouldn't discriminate against minorities, and we should respect all cultures... But massive immigration of unskilled people from third world countries was and still is a mistake by all accounts. Every country does regulate immigration for obvious reasons.

5550,"You are absolutely right! I just want to point out that there is a very different mechanic in boomers vs kids -- the most tech savvy kids are not the ones that get introduced to technology earlier. In fact the parents that wait till the child is older often (not always) actually have thought about these things and teach their kids about all this stuff.

My kid was almost the last one to get introduced to technology in their class (as a teen), and now when corona hit and online schooling became a thing they were the only one who knew what a browser was, how to create a good password, how to use Word. etc. The kids that got smartphones early knew the least (apart from using whatsapp and instagram), because very often the parents are boomers that think that technology is hard and that putting a phone in their kids hand at an early age will give them the edge that they themselves didn't get.

Also I work with kids and cyberbullying in group chats is very common. I think that a lot of kids aren't mature enough to use group chats till they are 13-14. Before that age kids don't really truly realise that they are talking to another person when they type things on the screen.

5655,"&gt; Yet most socialist states have been repressive dictatorships

I would say that's more due to the fact they've arisen under incredibly strenuous and tense political circumstances. Had the White Army, even a more liberal faction within it, won the civil war, there would have still been a period of tremendous authoritarianism that would have likely gone on for decades. 

&gt;because a socialist state by definition grants a lot of power to politicians, who are inherently corruptible.

Eh I don't think this is true. Soviet-style socialism does grant tremendous power to governmental and party *institutions* but that is very different than giving it to individual politicians. 

I do agree with you that a grassroots and decentralized system is an ideal that should be strived to, but it's one that is very difficult to achieve in material conditions of crisis. Disciplined political action, for all of its many long-term risks, is far more effective.

Political systems don't form for no reason or out of malice. I don't mean this as a defense of violent excess but as an explanation of it. I think we can both agree that liberalism isn't an ideology that relies inherently on violent terror and repression because of the Jacobins in the French Revolution. The same, I believe, is fair to apply to socialism. Authoritarianism is (usually) less an ideology, and more a response to material reality. Russia, Korea, Vietnam, and Cuba were all countries that entered an intense state of siege during the period following their revolutions. Authoritarianism is, sadly, the political response to such.

5666,"I think everyone is kind of talking passed each other here.

The benefit of the European system is that anyone can form a team, start in some random fourth league (super local) , work their way up to the third league (regional), the second league (low tier national), their countries first league and can then play in the Champions League.

The Champions league is open to anyone who can make it and no team has a secure spot. You need to earn the right to play and we like that.

On this front, the US is miserable. Your town doesn't have a franchise? Tough shit. No local team for you. You do have a franchise but it wants to move? Once again, tough shit.

You're not playing in the NBA or the NFL or any of the leagues unless you're allowed to buy in. 

Here's the flip side. Money plays a much larger role in Europe. Buying your way to the top is almost a requirement because, you don't have any guarantees. Manchester United or Real Madrid can simply not qualify for the Champions League or worse, can get kicked out of the Premier League or La Liga if they perform poorly enough. Consequently, if you have the money you will damn well spend it to get an edge.

In this sense, the US system is more fair, the teams have a decent chance of getting back on top each and every year. Every team has a real shot where as in Europe, it does happen that an outsider wins, but upsets are rare and the wast majority of teams from most countries don't stand a chance.

So the question is really, do you prefer a system that's fair to a select few who were grated the right to participate or a system where everyone anywhere has a chance, but it's a pretty poor chance at the best of times.",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/mvf7w0/us_owners_find_americanstyle_greed_doesnt_play/gvgkyqp/,neohellpoet,1619108714
