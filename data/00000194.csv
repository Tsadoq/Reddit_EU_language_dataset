25,"‚ÄúWe all love Finland‚Äù. I‚Äôve actually thought a lot about this. Generally speaking, yes, the internets really does love Finland. But why? Why in the world are posts on Reddit about Finland so popular? Here is what I think:

1) Finland is non-threatening. We are a little country perched in the corner of Europe and pose no threat to anyone. People in the great powers (global or regional) can smile at Finland and not feel challenged.

2) Finland is a symbol for a lot of things the typical Reddit user is interested in. Redditors tend to be young Americans and are focused on things relevant to their lives, such as free education, highly developed technology and universal health care. Finland offers this (perceived) ideal society.

3) Finns are humble and excel in self-deprecation. We know how silly we are and we have no illusions about it. 

4) Our global ambassadors are very likable. We have Santa Claus, goofy-looking ex-presidents like Halonen and I-don‚Äôt-give-a-fuck drunken F1 drivers like R√§ikk√∂nen. Honestly, who couldn‚Äôt like them? These characters are worth ‚Ç¨10 billion in tourism advertising.

5) We are imagined as the world‚Äôs successful underdog, and people love the successful underdog. We have some good history on our side, such as fucking up the Russian army during the Winter War. People have a tendency to love an ideal of ‚Äújustice‚Äù and relate it to their daily lives.

Note this is a work in progress, but I think this helps to explain why little countries like Finland or Estonia are so loved on Reddit.

57,"&gt;Fast forward 10 years and the entire country is bankrupt..

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But *also* fast forward 10 years, and -at least in the fields of architecture, urban planning, and infrastructure- there's been *massive* improvements.

From new airport terminals currently under construction to replace the dilapidated old ones all across Greece from Corfu and Thessaloniki to Heraklion and Kos; to a new [modern motorway system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highways_in_Greece) that's now nearing completion; to [amazing new hotels](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/greece/hotels/) with historic architecture, totally unlike the 80s concrete boxes; [to the regeneration of Athens' waterfront on Phalero Bay](http://www.gazzetta.gr/plus/koinwnia/article/1278410/allazei-rizika-i-opsi-toy-falirikoy-ormoy-pics); to [landscape architecture starting to take off as a serious profession](https://www.snfcc.org/about/vision/the-stavros-niarchos-park/); to a historic preservation across the country being taken far more seriously, such as [the restoration of Arcadian towns](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/01/tourism-is-our-lifejacket-debt-stricken-greece-gets-record-number-of-visitors) in the central Peloponnese, or the [restoration of the Zagoria stone villages](https://theculturetrip.com/europe/greece/articles/why-visiting-the-mountainous-region-of-zagori-greece-is-a-must/) in Epirus, the restoration of the [baroque town of Corfu](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/978/gallery/), the [neoclassical town of Ermoupoli](https://lifeviews.gr/exodos/2017/06/elliniko-kafenio-stin-kardia-tis-ermoupolis/), to the strict building codes now governing the island of Santorini requiring buildings to match the tradition of the island. On a smaller scale, even streets and sidewalks are being taken more seriously in recent years.

This is not to minimize the problems the country faces, such as corruption, but there's several things going on that that have forced hugely positive changes, whether some Greeks like it or not. For starters, decentralization has allowed regions and municipalities a lot more local control, *and local accountability*, which has been very good for urban planning. Second, the increasing use of public-private-partnership with the participation of construction conglomerates for big infrastructure projects has allowed things like motorways, airports, and bridges to bypass corruption and force projects through, at speeds unimaginable before (for the *most* part. Yes, the Ellinikon project is dragging, because of NIMBYism, but for the most part, things have changed on this front). Third, kind of tied to the second point, the financial crisis has been a blessing in disguise, forcing overdue reforms that political parties previously feared implementing out of fear of losing votes, but nowadays left with no choice but to implement. Fourth, Greece's millennials and the younger Gen Xers are very different from their parents: they're far more educated and well-traveled and are bringing a generational change to the Greek mentality and their relationship with the state.

With regards to people being pushy and rude to you...I wasn't there with you every time you experienced such a thing. Part of it can be culture shock, part of it can be that you're generalizing...that out of every 50 locals you interacted with in Greece, 1 was pushy, rude, or impolite, and you remember that person disproportionally much more than the other 49.  Humans do tend to do this. I can say for myself, having grown up moving back-and-forth between 3 countries (USA, France, and Greece), the proportions of rude, pushy, and inconsiderate people seem to be about equal in all three countries. (That's not to mention the countries I've *visited*, including Canada, Spain, Britain, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Brazil, and Argentina). I'm not saying that cultural differences don't exist and that generalizations have absolutely *no* merit, but a lot of this can be explained with cultural differences.  Unlike, say, Americans, Greeks are not raised to smile and ""look happy"" all the time...or unlike Middle Easterners, Greeks are not overly hospitable. But there *is* a Greek type of politeness that Americans don't possess, and I've witnessed countless foreign tourists in Greece act rudely and impolitely, and the Greeks just shrug it off. (Just one example: I was on a bus in Corfu island, going from the town of Agios Gordis to Corfu Town. Agios Gordis, where the bus route started, is a beach resort town. So, all the young tourists took all the seats. As the bus was going through all these little towns in the island's interior, picking up elderly locals, none of the young Brits or Swedes were giving up their seats for the 80-year-old Greeks boarding the bus. And there's countless other stories of rudeness I can come up with).  Greeks are also not a monolith; I've witnessed locals berating a fellow local for being rude to a tourist.

Which takes me to the following point: if you don't speak Greek, there's a lot of things Greeks say to each other that you miss out on.  While Greeks may come off to no-Greeks as being too proud sometimes, or have an undeserved superiority complex, etc, what they say to *each other* is very different. They're very, very self-critical, and all the things you said -even if overexaggerated- they say to themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

Just so you know, I'm not one of the people that downvoted your comment.  Although I think you're being far too harsh than the Greek people deserve, you're keeping it civil.  :)

You come off as someone that cares deeply about the country, otherwise the country's problems wouldn't bother you so much.  Thus, you're holding the country to a high standard, as you *should*.

The thing is, when I come across such criticism, I try to kinda explain a little bit of perspective, and some recent Greek history. Greece is not by any stretch third world, or even poor. Despite its problems, it's a modern and developed country, but on the poorer end of ""rich country"" (as defined by the World Bank, IMF, UN, and OECD), and currently emerging from a depression, like (for example) the US once went through in the 1930s. And despite this deep crisis, it managed to keep its democratic institutions and civil society intact, and a healthcare system that, despite all its problems, [continues to rank highly](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-19/u-s-near-bottom-of-health-index-hong-kong-and-singapore-at-top) for delivering results.  So, by northern and western European standards, yes, there's catching up to do. And despite the glorious \[if ridiculously over-romanticized\] past, there's [geographic reasons](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-advantages-of-having-a-lot-of-mountains-for-the-Greeks) Greece couldn't keep up with northern and western Europe economically in the 19th and 20th centuries.  So, it's important to keep things in perspective, and not exaggerate. Because you care, I urge you to follow up with news developments in Greece....when you regularly follow what's going on, you're less likely to make inaccurate assumptions. There's reasons to be hugely optimistic.

88,"Rrrrhmmm, Turkish state backed media released maps of turkey with expanded borders, where Turkey was controlling parts of Greek and Bulgarian Thrace and parts of northern Turkey and Syria. These maps were reposted by Turkish defense ministers/high-up military brass, and since the autocrat Erdogan didn't through them in jail, he tacitly approved at least. 

Turkey has started handling the taxes of northern Syria where the olive branch forces are in control, as well as pruning the rebel groups that control the north to for their needs. Turkey still hasn't left northern Cypress even though there's no threat of violence there, so I doubt they'll give up control of northern Syria. They've also established military bases along the front lines with the Syria government forces, which further indicates Turkish entrenchment. Erdogan calls for further action than what has been taken.

Turkish naval vessels have stopped research vessels from the un and eu recognized government of Cypress from exploring gas fields off the coast of Cypress. I highly doubt Erdogan wouldn't have issued an apology if he didn't approve or even order the Turkish naval action.

89,"&gt;I sometimes wonder for how long the current way we use the internet is sustainable and whether we should even want it this way still...

I have to agree with you on this one, even though I don‚Äôt like it, but I do think that the internet we know today will be dead in a decade or two at the very maximum. And I‚Äôm saying this as someone who grew up with the internet since the late 90s. All the signs point to the fact that the internet will soon be sliced up in a bunch of smaller geonets. China already has this, all the foreign sites and services which aren't outright blocked (of which there are so many there isn't even a publicly available comprehensive list) are deliberately slowed down by Chinese ISPs, making it inconvenient for Chinese people to use. Russia is also headed in this direction. Between the EU and US, the legislative differences are becoming so big, especially now with the GDPR, Copyright directives in the EU and the death of net neutrality in the US, that it will soon become impossible for companies to offer services both in the EU and US under the same business model. After all, if you can't use or sell personal data willy nilly or distribute content from other sources for free, it will eventually become impossible to offer anything for free and we'll eventually find ourselves spending hundreds of euros each month just to be able to do all the things on internet we used to be able to do for free in the past, like read news and blogs, watch cat videos or keep in touch with friends and family. 

In this new era, VPNs will become a sort of digital passports, allowing you to access different geonets, but their services will probably become more expensive, not only due to increased demand and the value of their service being artificially increased, but also due to increased legal complexity that will make it impossible for just any random small company with a couple of employees to rent a bunch of servers around the world and offer VPNs to anyone.

199,"If you mean every building made during the fascist regime (almost 22 years, from 1922 up to 1943), there would have been no reason at all to destroy e.g. any anonymous apartment building and leave dozens of families on the street just because their home was built in that era. Same goes for hospitals, railway stations, post offices, ministries, etc. 

If you mean fascist style, well, that was not fascist at all: it's called [rational architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism_(architecture\)) (part of the broader [Modern architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_architecture) concept), and the Thirties represented its heyday. Sure enough the fascist regime adopted it as their style, but there are fine examples of it in other countries too, where fascism as a political movement either never existed or never reached any powerful position. In Italy we have wonderful examples of rational architecture which are unfortunately underestimated or completely ignored right because of the era they represent. Luckily enough they were preserved, as it would have been a crime to destroy them.

Finally, if you mean blatantly fascist symbols, mottos, era numbers, etc. they have been removed almost everywhere, except for some minor cases that went unnoticed, or in some cases where it would have meant to ruin some important example of rational architecture. A case worth noting is the *Foro Italico* in Rome, a huge sports complex expressly built to celebrate fascism and Mussolini, it's entrance featuring huge white marble blocks engraved with fascist regime milestones. There were some blocks not yet engraved, set aside for future milestones, and after the war three more milestones were added: end of the fascist regime (July 25th, 1943), proclamation of the Italian Republic (June 2nd, 1946), enactement of the republican Constitution (January 1st, 1948).

Edit ‚Äî Another interesting example of recontextualization of a fascist monument, again in Bolzano/Bozen, is the former seat of the fascist party, a palace bearing a huge fascist-themed bas-relief on its facade: it was [recontextualized by superimposing on it a sentence of Hannah Arendt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_del_Fascio_(Bolzano\)) which counterbalances the original fascist motto that could still be seen underneath.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/aapv4n/the_fascist_victory_monument_in_bozen_italy/ecuj8by/,gerri_,1546140339

It's not a slum, just a modern building (with utilitarian 60s/70s architecture) that doesn't take its historic surroundings into consideration.  Plenty of examples of that in places like the US, Japan, or post-Mao China.

That said, a big part of it was/is Greek insularity for a good part of the post-war era. A lot of rural people flooded Athens and other Greek cities in the 60s and 70s, and had little aesthetic regard for their adopted cities (which is ironic, because a lot of these rural people came from cute little towns). There was little exchange with other countries, and little understanding with how things are done abroad. In this regard, Greece was more like the US rather than other European countries...add the modern Greek fetishization of ancient and medieval times: any historical building that was from maybe the 1890s or 1920s wasn't appreciated because it wasn't historical enough (this started to change in the late 80s).  So, neoclassical buildings were torn down, and replaced with ugly 60s/70s architecture.  The fact that these new ugly buildings clashed with the classical ruins they were so close to, just didn't dawn on people at that time. Add the fact that there were few and/or inadequate urban planning or historic preservation laws then, and you got results like this. Things are hugely improving now, but it'll take generations to undo the mess that was already built in the 1960s-1990s.

*But*....with the financial crisis, natives fleeing central Athens, Chinese interest in investing in Greece, and tourism being a hugely important industry, there may be an opportunity to rebuild central Athens, like what Haussman did for Paris. But you also have very strong NIMBYism in Greece today...

It is an established fact. Do your own reading.

&gt;**Irrogant**. *Sigh* Remember the 2004 referendum( 64.91% Yes - Turks, 35.09% Yes - Greeks) or 2015-2017 talks then talk. Turks in Cyprus wants to live without any political interferance(This applies to both Turkey and Greece). Greeks wants this too I think but politicans and morons are pushing their own agendas like you.

I already replied to this point, but your lack of understanding of the situation is so vast that you did not even realize it. The 2004 referendum included a cause for Turkey to be able to invade, and of course nobody would vote for that. You can only talk bullshit because you have no knowledge on the subject whatsoever.

&gt;Yeah tell this to UNFICYP or United Kingdom(look at these shiny bases on the Greek side).

1. The bases are completely unrelated to the invasion, as they are part of the Zurich-London agreements
2. The UNFICYP is a peace-keeping force which occupies the line of fire. This does not and cannot justify de jure borders, it is merely a sign of where conflict exists. Which conflict is propagated solely by Turkey for the past half century.

&gt;Well.. This is the truth but all the world also cannot use any heavy punishment because of Turkey has some very strong reasons to ""occupy"" this part of the island. 

Yes, very strong reasons such as control of Eastern Aegean, expansion, and getting free property out of the population that used to live there (surprise surprise, Turkey is at it again).

No racist is going to be convinced by a message against racism that would fit on a billboard, otherwise they would already be convinced. So we need to encourage non racist people to speak up.

&gt;For comparison, imaging a campaign against illegal pirating software or media, that just says ""You can get to jail for illegal pirating"". Without further arguments,

So you mean almost all arguments against pirating. 

&gt;Without further arguments, would you think that is a morally bad thing to do just because it is against a law? Probably not, and you can just go on to vote a party that promises to change those laws.

The thing about pirating is that there are actually many valid arguments for why it is not immoral and why ip and cr laws, at least the way they function now, are actually harmful to society. ",,/r/europe/comments/aann7l/turin_municipal_government_billboard_campaign/ectw6d8/,Jannis_Black,1546121843

322,"The ""red scarfs"", who oppose the ""yellow jackets"", and the collective ""stop, now, it's enough"" have decided to organise a march in Paris.

&amp;#x200B;

The collective ""stop, now, it's enough"" and the ""red scarfs"" movement, who  oppose the ""yellow jackets"" movement, which continues with it's Act 7 on  the 29th of December, asked on Facebook for a march to support the  President, who's under the critics of the ""yellow jackets"" since the  17th of November. This march is planned for the 27th of January, 2pm,  place de la R√©publique in Paris.

**""We want to stay apolitical""**

Following the call of the collective ""stop, now, it's enough"", ""*we  immediately said yes, but with a condition, the march must be  non-politicised, as we have in the ""red scarfs"" people from the entire  political spectrum and want to stay apolitical*"", said on the page of the event Benois Peintre, one of the member of the ""red scarfs"". ""*By joint agreement, we decided to rename this march ""Marche r√©publicaine des libert√©s""* (republican march of freedoms)"", he added.

The  ""red scarfs"" movement, who say they've registered the march \[I'm sorry I  don't know what is the good translation for this, basically, you need  to tell the cops you're gonna march before doing so, they say they've  done it\], is demanding ""*the end of blockades and incivilities committed by the ""yellow jackets"" for weeks*"", ""*the return of dialogue between the ""yellow jackets"" and the government, in a peaceful environment*"". The movement say they're opposed to the ""r√©f√©rendum d'initiative populaire"" (referendum launched by the citizens), ""*which would be an assault against*"" the institutions and the economy, and invite people to stop ""*fake-news*"" and ""*political moves to gather the anger*"".

334,"Equaling Alexander's conquests was always on his mind, and stayed in the Roman mindset long after Caesar was gone. I'm fairly sure if Caesar had had the opportunity, his military genius was such that he would have conquered the Parthians. Under his heir Augustus (previously Octavius), the first actual emperor, there was the genius and loyal general Agrippa, who given a chance in his prime surely could have bested the Parthians too in my humble opinion. But there were too many internal struggles, and the empire was rather more focused at that time on conquering the British isles, and subduing the Germans, but also dealing with the last rebellions of the Iberians and Gauls.

At some point though, the Roman Empire lost that drive of conquest and somehow held on for centuries as a decaying empire depending on barbarian mercenaries rather than local italics who gave a shit about the Empire. That's why studying early Roman history, from the Republic to the early empire, until say, Trajan who died in 117, is quite interesting. But after that, apart from the odd good emperor, it's just downhill from there. Gets kind of frustrating. For some reason, studying Roman history, despite them being a ruthless bunch, you can't help but hope for their success, and deplore the fact that they just kept fighting eachother and losing the drive that made them so invincible in their prime.

390,"&gt;Soviet symbols on these monuments aren't there for symbolising communism but the USSR. 

So how does one make the distinction between a Soviet red star and a Communist red star that both look the same?

You don't, that's how.

&gt; I think you're confusing literal empires with Soviet empire or American empire... 

I think you're not contributing to the discussion and argue for your opinion. You make a claim that 'people don't even tear down monuments of the empires they've been ruled by' and instead of proving it (or yielding to factual evidence pointing out the contrary), you start engaging in pointless theoretical discussions on how 'empire' somehow should not apply to the Soviet Union (which you have accused of imperialism previously, so in your fantasy world, imperialist states are simultaneously not empires, if I'm getting this right).

&gt; It's like saying slavery was a democratic crime.  

What is? You're saying that the Soviet Union, despite having the official and rather vocal support of most existing communist parties at the time, was somehow not a communist state. And then fail to provide reasons to this bold claim. Slavery is a crime - no adjectives, because a multitude of ideologies, systems of government etc. have allowed it.

&gt; Eh no? There is pretty much definition of the ideology to many extends.  Just like you don't go and say ""who decides genocide and slavery isn't  the very democratic ideology"", and say ""oh the democrat parties decide  that"", you pretty much do the same for communism... 

There's a definite answer to your question: it is the international community of sovereign states that had decided genocide is a crime.

This, however, does not answer my original question: who gets to decide with the same authority what is and what isn't 'proper' communism?",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/aajllk/hungary_removes_statue_of_antisoviet_icon_imre/ecty0gt/,StatementsAreMoot,1546123151

419,"The cultural development of adopting a religion purely for political gain ? Isn't that what the germanic and slavic tribesmen sought ? We don't even know Constantine's true motive for adopting the religion, nor do we know why paganism was violently prohibited decades later.

The purest example of hypocrisy that mirrors the false ""european christians"" narrative is the one about Asiatic tribes switching between Islam, Christianity and Judaism whenever they saw fit.

Christianity is a near East cult, denying it would be to go against the doctrine. Jesus is Levantine and the first Christians were middle eastern. Even Islam started off as a Nestorian branch to further advance my point.

Regarding the developments of the Renaissance, it's called Renaissance for a reason. A return to the roots of pre-Christian Europe, its philosophies and notably poetry. The greatest artists at the time worked under the Church because of the massive paychecks, not because they were devout followers of the Christ.

And don't talk about the last 2 millennia, considering Europe was divided with varying degrees of religiousness between the kingdoms and empires. Modern Spain didn't exist until 1492 and the Eastern Roman empire completely vanishd by then.

The Enlightenment is the greatest thing to have happened in history.

I definitely think there are some musicians who had it better when records were a thing, but many also don't realize that without Spotify they wouldn't be selling any music at all.

I do, but I still see too much ""narrowminded-ness"" in there about this.

Some years ago I moved to Lithuania, and as the video says, here the Romuva paganism is something very noticeable. Majority of lithuanians are catholic too, but they were one of the last places in Europe to be christianized, and you can totally notice that. The Romuva people make their celebrations for solstices and equinox just by the main cathedral in Vilnius and it's not a problem! No one gets offended by that! In fact, many of the people who attend to these celebrations are christians, but they consider it something more cultural and traditional than religious. I guess after the URSS fall, the country was recovering many of their traditions and this can be considered one.

Don't want to talk too much, because probably some lithuanians can come and explain it better than me, but for me as ""visitor"" their paganism is something beautiful and related to nature and their roots, so I can totally understand why people would turn to this.

&amp;#x200B;

The current reasoning for sculptory rearrangements all over the country's symbolic spaces is that things must be restored to the state as of 19 March 1944 (the day of the German invasion and the complete loss of Hungarian sovereignty).

Well, Heroes Square is pretty symbolic and there had been fairly significant changes there since 1944.

I wonder when will that issue be addressed and the 1944 statues restored - because surely the government does not use double standards regarding illegitimate Commie changes to our sacred national places. Right?

&amp;#x200B;

(Of course it won't be restored, since the Commies had a lucid interval that time and had the presence of mind to only tear down statues of Habsburg rulers and erect statues of Hungarian rebel leaders in their stead. Our government, the rebel freedom fighters they are, can't tear down well-meaning, if a little wild homeboys and place damned, possibly Brussels-born foreign oppressors at their rightful places.

645,"If you want an opinion from an actual Macedonian it's ridiculous that people don't consider Samoil to be ours. Sure he called himself a Bulgarian Tsar, but he was centered in our country and was there from birth to death. I understand if you think Alexandar the Great isn't ours since he had nothing to do with our country and people, but Samuil is most definitely a part of Macedonian history.

As for the other things. The Macedonian and Bulgarian language are pretty different. Right now Macedonians understand Serbian more than Bulgarian. During the XIX century a lot of Macedonian writers wanted to have a shared Bulgarian Macedonian language. The problem is that the Bulgarian language is based on the eastern dialects making the language hard to understand for many Macedonians. People wanted to change the base of the Bulgarian language to western Bulgarian dialects, but Bulgarians didn't care and ignored all the people who wanted this. A lot of Macedonian writers also moved to Sofia where people criticised them for not knowing Bulgarian. These disillusioned Macedonian immigrants to Bulgaria are part of the reason Macedonians evolved to have a seperate national identity. The Bulgarians of the time didn't see Macedonians as brothers, but as more Bulgarians to fuel Big Bulgaria. And all Bulgarian nationalists still see us like that and it's the reason why Macedonia and Bulgaria uniting is impossible.

About VMRO there are two distinct phases of its existence that are the most important. VMRO was formed as a resistance movement in the Ottoman Empire which quickly got Bulgarian government backing. And the Bulgarian government almost destroyed it by needless interference. The most famous uprising in August 1903 happened far earlier than it was supossed to thanks to Bulgarian government interference and internal disagreement. Our biggest national hero Goce Delcev tried to stop this, but died during this period, killed by the Turks. After this VMRO changed drastically and most of the great Macedonian revolutionaries of this period were assasinated in Sofia by VMRO which was controlled by the Bulgarians and everything about VMRO after the Balkan Wars is thought to be a stain in our history.

And as for Macedonians having a Bulgarian identity before WW2 that is not true. Macedonia is a region that all of the neighbouring countries tried to assimilate. Serbia wanted us to be Serbian, Bulgaria wanted us to be Bulgarian and Greece wanted us to be Greeks. You have to understand that in this period Macedonians didn't think themselves to be exclusively Bulgarian and in fact a large amount of people considered themselves to be Serbians. If Macedonia was annexed by Bulgaria there would no doubt have been a Serbian separatist movement. The reason why Macedonians exist as a separate ethnicity is that everybody wanted to annex Macedonia, but nobody tried to treat the Macedonian people decently, everyone was tired of fighting each other for no good reason and people wanted our country to be ruled by the people that lived here, not Bulgarians in Sofia or Serbians in Belgrad. 

Most people think that the real problems with our history books that lead us to a disagreement with Greece is that we claim that the Greek people ethnically cleansed Macedonians/or however you want to call the slavic speaking people that lived in modern Greece. This is most definitely true though, there a lot of former refugees from Aegean Macedonia that fled from Greece, the grandfather of a friend of mine still has land in Greece for example, but he moved to Macedonia because of Greek pogroms after WW2.",,/r/europe/comments/a4vq90/macedonian_foreign_ministry_reacts_after_a_speech/ect5ag8/,Gay_Dr,1546100836

The movie 'Daens'  (1992, set in 1888) gives a good view on what life as like for common people at the time and their struggle to live a life less controlled by their bosses. 

People were struggling to survive in the wake of the industrial revolution, working in factories and mines, living in cramped unhygienic housing owned by the factory bosses, buying good from stores owned by their bosses, sometimes not even paid in money, but currency only valid at those shops. Alcoholism, iliteracy, child labor, disease and work related accidents were rampant, 12 hour workdays for 6 days a week were the norm.

By the start of the 20th century the lifes of ordinary folk started to improve.
 For example the introduction of mandatory education for children in 1914 helped a lot to make normal people literate and able to improve their own lifes, it also finally got children out of the workforce. 

But I don't think we can give Leopold much credit for that. Most of it was fought hard for by the people themselves, although some of it was facilitated by bourgoisie women, especially the care for the children.

786,"Amsterdam has something that reminds me of this.

When there were a lot of people going to the Americas to start businesses, people would invest in those settlers, hoping they would get some good returns later on. One man who lived in the centre of Amsterdam saw an investment opportunity when a construction company wanted to buy his house and his neighbours houses and build a hotel in its place.

He put himself into debt, invested in a settler and waited for the hotel to make their bid. He initially refused because he wanted to drive up the price for extra profit. And then he refused the next bid. And then the next. Eventually the price was too high for the hotel's taste, but the debt for his own investment was still there.

With no money except *maybe* in the far future, he fell into poverty and eventually jumped off the roof, but the construction company never got ownership of the house, so the house is still there... with the Victoria Hotel built around it.

If you ever go to Amsterdam, you can see for yourself; it's right outside Central Station.

827,"&gt; Yeah? The Turks used Sunni Muslim Kurds as their pawns in the Armenian genocide against Armenians, Assyrians, Alevi Kurds, etc. 

Alevi Turks you mean? Alevi Zazas and them being attacked was a thing, but Alevi Kurds weren't targeted since them being in remote areas.

They weren't used as ""pawns"". They were simply encouraged, they once had alliances with sultans and then they were rather formed into brigades during the Abd√ºl'hamid II, and during the 1915, they were let free to do anything, which resulted with them also targeting Assyrians. Being used as a pawn is a different concept.

&gt; Did not happen in (very) recent times though and unlike Turks most Kurds recognize this and see it as a dark side of history

Don't make me laugh mate. They don't really recognise anything, but their nationalist organistions just recognised stuff without any consequences for them. They're simply still demanding the lands they've taken over/stolen as their ancestral homeland, and their country.

&gt; these lands did become majority Kurdish 100 years ago though

Eh, not really. Transition happened within the 100 years.

It's also not just about the lands they've taken over from Assyrians and Armenians, but they're also claiming lands they've migrated and they don't consist a majority, and even not existing really.

&gt; it‚Äôs not as recent as you make them out to be

It's recent? Not sure what's recent for you... 5 years?

&gt; not as much done willingly or supported by most Kurds as you make it out to be

It has been done willingly and supported by Kurds if you're talking about the genocides. If you're talking about taking those lands as their country, that's what Kurdish nationalists want, sowwy.

&gt; Also it‚Äôs not something bad to claim lands where you‚Äôre not the majority as your peoples native lands

Only they're not indigenous or anything to those lands.

&gt; Kurds are Iranic nomads mixed with the local Armenian population, they‚Äôre going to be all over the place, what they call Kurdistan can easily overlap with Assyria and Assyria can overlap with Armenia or Arab land, it doesn‚Äôt exclude the other, unless ofcourse, we are talking about who owns the land which would be Turks, Syrians and Iraqi‚Äôs

Everyone is mixed, yet seriously, being mixed with someone doesn't entitles you the regions that you don't consist a majority or even not a minority. Lands aren't also limited to the Armenian Highlands, so I doubt mixing with Armenians is a real argument here.

&gt; In addition to all of this the region has been referred to as Kurdistan in a bunch of historical maps, that google maps uses it isn‚Äôt something rare or special

Traditonal region being referred as Kurdistan and the maps Kurdish nationalists came up with are pretty different. Again, I do wonder why they haven't included Georgia or some parts of Kuban, lol.

869,"&gt; Not taking up responsibility is same as denying it.

The state taking up responsibility for its history and the state involving itself with denial or recognition of its history and independent institutions or bodies in countries recognizing history on their own are all completely different things. 

For a start, the main difference between Belgium/Germany and Turkey is that the latter deeply involves itself with denial, in fact no other country comes close to state denial of history as Turkey does, closest is Japan. Turkey excels at controlling the academic institutions in Turkey as well as state institutions to be inline with the denial policy whereas the same cannot be said about Belgium and Germany for a start because they are democracies and there is academic independence as well institutional. 

The second difference is recognition of history, whether through academy, institutions etc. 

Political or parliamentary recognitions of genocide as seen for example with the Armenian genocide cases are political in nature when institutions fail to act, within these countries through external pressure which Turkey has been doing or within Turkey itself where these recognitions also target. When a country functions freely where academy and institutions are independent and are not forced to follow any policy there is no need to enforce anything through parliaments or similar. 

Try to commemorate a Herero or Nama genocide in any European country, no one will stop you. Now try commemorating the Armenian genocide. You will have the Turkish embassy act aggressively and pressure the political groups aligned with Turkey to stop it, including pressuring the press if it is covering the event. And this occurs in liberal democratic Europe and the west. There is no comparison even remotely possible between what Turkey does and what Germany and Belgium do or better said don‚Äôt do. 

The quote I provided about Japanese admittance includes admitting state responsibility through Japanese military which I highlighted. Again you will not find something similar officially stated by any Turkish official. Turkey refuses to acknowledge that the state did *anything wrong*. To the contrary it officially justifies the actions of the state. I am not saying Japan is doing it correctly, what I am saying is that the very little Japan has done is much more than Turkey has done.

* obviously climate change and its impacts on how society functions and our relationship with energy

* the ongoing, intensifying information wars, how digital everything has become chaotic everything, how to respond while preserving democracy, what a free press means in the 21^st century

* the rapidly changing world balance, the withdrawal of the US from international diplomacy, the rapid ascent of China, India and others

Most obvious source says

&gt;German historian Hans Mommsen wrote that resistance in Germany was ""resistance without the people"" and that the number of those Germans engaged in resistance to the Nazi regime was very small.[3] The resistance in Germany included German citizens of non-German ethnicity, such as members of the Polish minority who formed resistance groups like Olimp.

My point is, being in opposition to Nazis and supporting idea of Lebensraum are two totally different matters. Your opposition still cold actively support pan Germanic policies.

Examples

Graf von Stauffenberg, opposition, hero? Or disgruntled Nazi who took part willingly in wars and atrocities then took part in conspiracy against Hitler just because he was losing war? 

Konrad Adenauer. Opposition? He stopped denazification in 1949,  freed all Nazi war criminals, employed them in his government, organizations and services.

1146,"Poland and Belgium are two areas of Europe that have been historically conquered a lot and been ruled by foreign powers a lot. Poland obviously by Prussians/Germans and Russians, Belgium by the countries mentioned above.

Even before that, Belgium lacked a central power and the territory was basically a collection of small duchies that were often raided. This created a culture of distrust for the government and strangers, a culture of risk avoidance etc. That's why if you walk in Belgium, you'll see all houses are locked and many with the curtains closed, while in the Netherland, who historically weren't conquered and had a stable history, leave their curtains open. Silly detail maybe, but that's how deep history can nest itself into small intricacies of a certain culture.

As this victimhood or distrust is rather internalized, it is a much harder to look at ones own people and country as an evil aggressor. That's why Belgians, including me to some extent I guess, still have difficulty coming to terms with that past and why Polish people won't acknowledge the role of Polish people in the Holocaust the same way Germans would.

https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/es.html

&gt;Demographic profile:
&gt;
&gt;El Salvador is the smallest and most densely populated country in Central America. It is well into its demographic transition, experiencing slower population growth, a decline in its number of youths, and the gradual aging of its population. The increased use of family planning has substantially lowered El Salvador's fertility rate, from approximately 6 children per woman in the 1970s to replacement level today. A 2008 national family planning survey showed that female sterilization remained the most common contraception method in El Salvador - its sterilization rate is among the highest in Latin America and the Caribbean - but that the use of injectable contraceptives is growing. Fertility differences between rich and poor and urban and rural women are narrowing.

-

&gt; Total Fertility Rate: 1.84 children born/woman (2018 est.)

That's below the replacement rate of 2.1.

Population Pyramid for El Salvador:

https://www.populationpyramid.net/el-salvador/2017/

According to that, the 10-14 age cohort and younger is actually where the pyramid inverted, so you actually should have fewer 3-10 year olds than would be the case for population maintenance.

That being said, IIRC from reading some paper a year or so back, some crazy-high portion of El Salvador's population ‚Äî like 30% or something ‚Äî is in the US.  I assume that it's older people doing that, for work, so that might make for a higher ratio of kids staying home.

&gt; Native Americans in the United States are more likely than any other racial group to practice racial exogamy, resulting in an ever-declining proportion of indigenous ancestry among those who claim a Native American identity.^[85] In the United States 2010 census, nearly 3 million people indicated that their race was Native American (including Alaska Native).^[86] This is based on self-identification, and there are no formal defining criteria for this designation. Especially numerous was the self-identification of Cherokee ethnic origin,^[87] **a phenomenon dubbed the ""Cherokee Syndrome"".**^[88] The context is **the cultivation of an opportunistic ethnic identity** related to the perceived prestige associated with Native American ancestry.^[89] Native American identity in the Eastern United States is mostly detached from genetic descent, and embraced by people of predominantly European ancestry.^[89][90] Some tribes have adopted criteria of racial purity, usually through a Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood, and practice disenrollment of tribal members unable to provide proof of Native American ancestry. This topic has become a contentious issue in Native American reservation politics,^[91]

&gt; **Ethnic option is a term coined by sociologist Mary C. Waters to express her conception that ethnic identity of the descendants of immigrants is flexible, symbolic and voluntary, not a definitive aspect of their identity.**^[1][2] Waters argues that **with the achievement of middle-class suburban status, ethnicity becomes a lifestyle option, a costless form of community.**^[3]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_option

&gt; In sociology, symbolic ethnicity is a nostalgic allegiance to, love for, and pride in a cultural tradition that can be felt and lived without having to be incorporated to the person's everyday behavior;^[5] as such, a symbolic ethnic identity usually is composed of images from mass communications media.^[vague][4]

...

&gt; In the book Identity and Belonging: Rethinking Race and Ethnicity in Canadian Society (2006), by B. Singh Bolaria and Sean P. Hier, symbolic ethnicity is defined by, with, and in the actions of **""individuals who identify as Irish, for example, on occasions such as Saint Patrick's Day, on family holidays, or for vacations. They do not usually belong to Irish-American organizations, live in Irish neighborhoods, work in Irish jobs, or marry other Irish people.""**^[4] Therefore, the symbolic identity of ""being Irish"" is:

&gt; &gt; ***. . . [an] ethnicity that is individualistic in nature and without real social cost for the individual. These symbolic identifications are essentially leisure-time activities, rooted in a nuclear family traditions and reinforced by the voluntary enjoyable aspects of being ethnic.***[4]

edit:  A quote from [Albert Londres' wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Londres#Biography):

&gt;It must be said that we in France have erred. When someone ‚Äì sometimes with our knowledge ‚Äì is sent into forced labour, we say ""He has gone to Cayenne"". The penal colony is no longer at Cayenne, but at Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni first of all and later at the √éles du Salut. I ask, by the way, that these isles be debaptised, for they are not the Isles of Salvation, but the Isles of Punishment. The law allows us to behead murderers, not to employ them. Cayenne is nevertheless the capital of the penal colony. (...) Finally, I arrived at the camp. The labour camp. Not a machine for producing well defined, regulated, uniform punishment. A factory churning out misery without rhyme or reason. One would search in vain for any mould to shape the prisoners. It crushes them, that's all, and the pieces go where they may.

&gt;(Au bagne, 1923)

&gt;And the article continued: ""I was taken to these places. I was taken aback by the novelty of the fact. I had never before seen fifty men in a cage. [...] They were getting ready for night. The place was swarming with them. They were free from five in the evening until five in the morning ‚Äì inside their cage.""",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/aadk65/a_human_zoo_in_belgium_1905/ecs7v3r/,bonobo1,1546059471

&gt;It increasingly looks as though a new sanctuary for IS fighters, planners and recruiters has been established right in the middle of Europe.

Looks like it's possible to bypass Barron's paywall via Incognito/Private Browsing mode:

&gt;For much of the past decade, the euro area has been an anchor dragging down the global economy. It is in danger of being so again.
&gt;
&gt;The European Central Bank, the European Commission, and European politicians have repeatedly made destructive choices at the expense of Europeans and the rest of the world ever since the first rumblings of the financial crisis. The consequences have been catastrophic unemployment, especially among the young; rising poverty; and‚Äîperversely, given their stated objectives‚Äîgovernment debt burdens that are increasingly difficult to sustain.
&gt;
&gt;At the same time, Europe‚Äôs domestic weakness has curtailed spending on goods and services from its trade partners; instead, they have been forced to absorb the resulting glut of excess European productive capacity.
&gt;
&gt;Sometime around 2015, it seemed as if Europe had finally turned a corner. None of the bloc‚Äôs fundamental problems had been fixed, but the generalized financial panic had stopped, and monetary stimulus had begun to kick in. The depreciation of the euro helped by boosting exports, and the collapse in oil prices helped by reducing spending on imports, although the bulk of Europe‚Äôs recovery was driven by rising domestic spending on consumption and investment.
&gt;
&gt;Now, the brief and overhyped ‚Äúeuroboom‚Äù of 2017 has completely faded. The latest official data show the euro area growing at the slowest annual rate in more than four years. Real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of just 1.2% in the first nine months of 2018. The bloc grew 2.7% in 2017, 2.1% in 2016, 2% in 2015, and 1.6% in 2014.
&gt;
&gt;It would be easy, but wrong, to attribute the slowdown to temporary idiosyncratic factors. Italy‚Äôs borrowing costs have been elevated since May, for example, while German vehicle exports were temporarily hit by the introduction of new pollution standards for diesel engines. In fact, the slowdown is broad-based across all of the biggest economies‚ÄîGermany, France, Italy, and Spain‚Äîwhich together account for roughly three-quarters of the bloc‚Äôs output. (The hit to the French economy from the recent ‚Äúyellow vest‚Äù protests won‚Äôt show up in the GDP data until the fourth-quarter numbers are published next spring.)
&gt;
&gt;Worst of all, Europe‚Äôs slowdown is being driven by a steady and grinding reduction in the growth rate of private consumption, rather than some temporary volatility in investment spending or the trade balance. French consumer spending is growing at its slowest rate since the beginning of 2013. Italian consumption has flatlined and is in danger of shrinking outright. The deceleration of private spending is most extreme in Germany, with consumption growing at its slowest pace since the financial crisis. Spain is the strongest of the big four economies, but it, too, has experienced a notable slowdown relative to its average since 2014.
&gt;
&gt;Consumption is ultimately what makes business investments profitable, so if European consumers keep cutting back, European businesses will either have to sell more abroad as exports or cut investment. Either choice would be bad news for the rest of the world. Producers elsewhere would lose out if global consumers were forced to absorb the glut of excess European production, while investment cuts would reduce European demand for imports.
&gt;
&gt;Recent surveys of European businesses suggest the situation is only getting worse. IHS Markit reported that ‚Äúbacklogs of work fell for the first time in almost four years‚Äù in December as businesses adapted to ‚Äúthe reduced inflow of new business.‚Äù Focusing on Germany, Markit‚Äôs survey found that business ‚Äúoptimism was the lowest recorded for over four years,‚Äù marking a ‚Äústark contrast from the situation this time last year.‚Äù In France, Markit‚Äôs ‚Äúlatest flash data pointed to an outright contraction in France‚Äôs private sector for the first time in 2¬Ω years.‚Äù In Italy, ‚Äúoutput fell at the fastest pace in 67 months.‚Äù Spain is a relative bright spot in terms of actual orders and activity, but even there, ‚Äúbusiness expectations were at their lowest level since June 2013.‚Äù
&gt;
&gt;Other macro data suggest that the danger for Europe is more likely recession than overheating. Consumer prices excluding food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco have consistently been growing just 1% each year for the past six years. There has been no upward trend, despite the ECB‚Äôs previous commitment to restore inflation to its target of ‚Äúbelow, but close to, 2%‚Äù and its subsequent asset-purchase program. Moreover, unemployment remains crushingly high across much of the bloc. (The major exception is Germany, but even there, the official jobless rate is depressed by millions of low-paid part-time workers.)
&gt;
&gt;These are the kinds of conditions that normally make policy makers cautious about inadvertently pushing their economy into recession. Europe‚Äôs incomplete monetary union makes it especially fragile, and for all of the reforms made since 2011, the integrity of the common currency has not been tested by a broad-based downturn.
&gt;
&gt;Yet the ECB seems convinced that its job is done. At its most recent meeting on Dec. 13, the central bank confirmed that it would stop adding to its bond portfolio by the end of the month. The next step would be to start raising interest rates, perhaps as soon as next summer.
&gt;
&gt;Admittedly, the ECB has not committed to tighten on a fixed schedule and ECB President Mario Draghi emphasized in the postmeeting news conference that officials chose to ‚Äúkeep optionality as a dominant feature‚Äù of their policy stance. According to him, their future choices will depend ‚Äúon the situation of the economy‚Äù rather than arbitrary concerns about the calendar or the size of the balance sheet.
&gt;
&gt;The problem is that Draghi will be retiring next year. In the worst-case scenario, he would be replaced by someone as incompetent as his predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, as part of some grand compromise to appease politicians in Northern Europe. The likelier outcome is that Draghi‚Äôs replacement would have sound economic judgment, but lack the Italian‚Äôs skills at getting what he wants out of a diverse group of independent-minded officials.

1457,"Respectfully, I think you are removing consumerism from its socio-economic context if you are making the argument that supply and demand consumerism on its own is a thoughtful way of managing resources. You can't separate consumable products from the way they are made and at whose expense., and the devil lies in those details. 

Further, watch advertisements on cable TV in the USA (the Mecca of consumerism) and tell me it isn't batshit crazy. Everything is marketed to people by manipulating self esteem.  Want friends? Tell your parents to buy you this toy. Want friends? Buy this vodka.  Getting old? Buy this testosterone booster and 18 year olds will line up to ride your geriatric dick. Got a long term opioid habit and can't shit? Talk to your doctor about getting a prescription for your prescription.  Feeling inadequate about your masculinity? Buy this three quarter ton diesel pick up truck as your daily driver. All real adverts for real products. 

 It's insane. People should be able to consume, but we both agree that with freedom comes responsibility.  Unfortunately consumerist societies tend to be poor at solving collective action problems, because the short term profit goals of those who control the means of production are rarely in line with actions needed to address long term social, political or environmental problems. 

You'll live comfortably without the latest iPhone.  Not so much when your city gets hit with a record breaking hurricane, or with a wave of hungry climate migrants from between the tropic of cancer and capricorn.

For what it's worth, what plagued centrally planned economies of communist countries was an inefficiency in allocating resources. You had to make a five year plan and establish quotas for production grounded in inaccurate and inflexible information.  Compared to this, supply and demand is much more efficient in allocating resources. 

However, I really think that AI holds the key to even more efficient data driven economic planning that is more responsive than supply and demand capitalism. Combine this with cheap renewable and nuclear fusion energy, and society will start inching towards post-scarcity as everything from food to homes become much cheaper to produce. And I think it will be this, and not just a bloody Soviet style repressive revolution that will bring about a new era in how societies manage resources, the environment and the needs and wants of human beings.

Treaty gets rejected in a democratic vote, treaty gets modified, treaty gets approved in another democratic vote. It should be easy to comprehend.

Which would be great, but no national government is willing to rebalance the powers in the EU by giving more to the Parliament (as it should be) and less to the Commission, because it's always good - electorally speaking - to have a boogeyman you can blame everything on. Why should anyone want to remove that boogeyman?

That means that (with sufficient funding) it is possible to have good cycling infrastructure and public transport to get anywhere within your city, and to get to the train station. At that point the only thing you also need is a good train network, but I believe most countries already have this.

I think in many cases it's an attitude problem. In some countries, there seems to be a widespread idea that cycling is weird, dangerous, and outside the norm and it has low social status compared to driving a car.

&gt;source suggests that it could have happened that some of them escaped to Kingdom of Poland and acted from there yet in 1100.[1] Similarly, one of two versions by Kasper Niesiecki (considering origin of Polish Rawicz bearers) says that some of them were amiably accepted in 1108 by the King Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth of Poland, who granted them lands in Rawa Voivodship; also Jan D≈Çugosz supports it (however the other version by Kasper Niesiecki ‚Äì ""the better one"" is that the origin of Polish Rawicz bearers is pagan Polish).

&gt;it could be that some of Vr≈°ovci (because phonetically similar surnames were spotted among szlachta of two Polish coat of arms), in the midst of nobility referred to as Oksza (Werszowic, Werszowiec, Wierszowiec)[2] and Rawicz (Warsz, Warsza) bearers, probably participated in the Battle of Grunwald.

I agree.


&gt;I am absolutely convinced that public transport is the way forward.


I don't think so, maybe for the near future, however if self driving cars become a real thing then there are alot of gains to be had on the road, Cars could behave like ""trains"" and move way more efficient without traffic jams. But than human driven cars should be phased out, which I don't see happening in the near future.


&gt;But it can be and should be better, cheaper and faster.


Agreed, I'm just saying that is not what is happening right now, train tickets get more expensive every year, than you have the OV system with the fake ""concurrentie"" making the whole ticket system convoluted.


It does not help that a new train station has to be prestigious project for 625 million euro.

1869,"&gt;Why would the Scots pay the English debt? Thatcher literally stole their oil to save the severely deprived English economy. Those insignificant transfers that they got back in recent years is not a drop in the ocean of the oil wealth they could have had.

Scotland has received extra public spending continuously since the 1920s. Most years it has contributed less than the UK average, and only for about 15 of the last 90 years has it contributed more than it received.

In the 80s Scotland contributed a lot extra thanks to the booming oil revenue. But if you look at all the years since 1980, Scotland has had all it's onshore revenue, all its oil and gas taxes, and more than a population share of UK borrowing. In other words, Scotland's share of UK debt is higher per head than the UK average. If Scotland were to become independent and take on a population share of the UK debt it would be ahead. 

&gt;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fd72a39772929dadb08cfd20a1c84c6b-c

Why are you linking to a graphic about Norway? Norway has more oil and gas from a much smaller number of much larger fields, which means it has generated many times as much profit as the UK oil sector. Norway also has very high taxes which has enabled it to save a lot of the oil revenue. Scotland has high spending but low taxes, and Scottish politicians constantly push for higher spending and lower taxes. 

In other words, Scotland has spent its much lower oil revenue, Norway has saved its much higher revenue. It's worth pointing out that Norway didn't begin saving the oil revenue until its production passed 3 million barrels a day in 1997. UK oil production never reached 3 million barrels.

Yep, but not all the people live in cities. Even those who work in cities often times live in detached houses in suburbs (yes, even in Europe). UK is probably the most striking example of that. Also your cities are really close to each other - three biggest cities in the Netherlands (Haag, Amsterdam and Rotterdam) are literally next door to each other, so you don't really need cars to travel inside the country. It's quite uncommon for other european countries.

1970,"&gt; Probably because Russia is a huge threat to international security. Putting a NATO base into a country means Russia can't just annex that country without having to fight NATO. It acts as a deterrent.

The point of NATO was to contain USSR.
USSR fell, and U.S broke the deal they made with gorbachev at the time, about expanding NATO.
You have NATO bases in the baltic,Poland etc. They have been expanding like cancer.
Nato points their guns at Russia, and Russia is the aggressor...
U.S are the ones in the habit of invading countries, not Russia.
There is nothing left to discuss when you dont see the problem in the cold war thinking of NATO, they surround ""the enemy"", meddle in politics in neighboring countries in the direct sphere of influence of Russia, and blame Russia for when they react.

You still have not answered me, do you think U.S wouldnt react if russia interfered in mexican politics and installed a russian puppet in power? 
What do you think Americans would do in that case, if there was a risk of a Russian military base in mexico?

&gt; If Estonia can go from poor former Soviet-state to an emerging and powerful economy in 27 years, why can't Cymru do the same, and in an even shorter time frame?

Because 14 of those last 27 years were as a member of the EU. Even if Wales takes 10 years to get everything in order and leave the UK. Assuming they manage to leave meeting all the criteria for EU membership (which would be near impossible).It would then be years before they could join the EU (it took Croatia 10 years from application to join the EU to becoming a member.)

So we‚Äôre already at 2038 when Wales would get into the EU before you‚Äôd be able to start recovering. That‚Äôs assuming Spain agrees to let you join which they‚Äôve already said they‚Äôd refuse Scotland. And I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôd be able achieve it without the EU. 

Even if you could do it without the EU (unlikely) and in half the time Estonia did it (unlikely), how would you sell that to the population? ‚ÄúIn just 15 years from leaving the UK we can be the same as Estonia is today‚Äù?

For the purpose my reconstruction project I wanted to focus on the Romanesque and Brick-Gothic architecture that was still seen around the 16th century Riga, that could be be called medieval. 
Because there is so little data to work with, I just threw in three(still existing) residential buildings that are closer to the 17th century.  I will later remove some of the architectural detail that was added at a later age, like the Barque portal you see on the building on the right.
The main focus of the image is around the House of Blackheads . If you're interested, google how it looks now and you will see a clear distinction between the medieval vs Baroque detail that has been added later. 
As for the people - these were random 3d medieval people I had in my library, so I tried to leave them more as silhouettes that would better show the scale of the architecture and lead the eye towards the focus of the image. Still a lot of work to do to model them correctly.

2081,"The United Kingdom speaks English, as do the Dutch. Ireland uses Common Law, which would be a point in their favour, but then so does the UK. 

No, the reason that Ireland attracts such a disproportionate amount of business 'investment' is because it is is a tax haven ([not even remotely controversial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland_as_a_tax_haven)).

I don't see how you can possibly argue that a large part of Ireland's economy isn't predicated on siphoning off the economic productivity in other countries when that is precisely what tax havens do. 

It's additional government revenue that you wouldn't otherwise have, additional jobs that come with multinationals headquartering themselves in RoI (which they do for the tax benefits), and consequently less revenue and jobs for the countries where most of the business activity actually took place.

2084,"&gt; These are haplogroup studies. Autosomal studies are more reliable.

Haplogroups are a reliable and widely used science. You cannot simply dismiss them. Even granting the margin of error, the fact that multiple haplogroup studies consistently find Hungarians to cluster with their closest geographic neighbours is a very clear indication as to where they relations lie. As for autosomal studies, I could not find any peer-reviewed ones on the Hungarians.

But yes, Hungary is merely an example. Again, England is another, the Indo-Europeans in general a third.

&gt; I said it was spoken by a minority, not by elites.

The region was named after the Galatians, the Galatians are consistently referred to as the people inhabiting the region, and we know for a fact that there were several kings of Galatia (who were Celtic) during the first two centuries of its existence. This proves, without any doubt, that they were the elite for at least the first few centuries. 

Following this, the top-tier rulers became Roman officials, and information grows more scarce, but even as late as the 4th century, Saint Jerome claims they speak the same language as the Treveri in current-day Germany. If they Galatians were not either local elites or the majority of the population, it seems incredibly unlikely, knowing what we do about linguistic assimilation, that they should still be speaking an independent language after 4 centuries. 

Again, every document we do have refers to the people of Galatia speaking Galatian. Maybe they were a non-elite minority, but every single piece of evidence we have indicates they were neither.",Danmark,/r/europe/comments/aa3qzf/etymological_translations_of_european_capitals/ecq3k8s/,Eusmilus,1546000352

2134,"&gt; No, the LTE/UMTS fuck-up has a different reason. Back in 2000, the German state auctioneered off the spectrum licenses - for 50B ‚Ç¨! And in 2010, another auction happened, for 5B ‚Ç¨. Basically, 55B ‚Ç¨ that the private sector took up in debt to help prop up the gov't finances without forcing the state to put up bonds (=reducing state debt in the process)!
&gt; 
&gt; All this money had to be earned back by the telcos first, and not all of them survived as a result - turns out Germany is stupidly expensive to build a cellphone network given the size and the amount of mountains, forests and other difficult-to-build environment.

This is why it's so important for the government to help the smaller carrier. In Poland we also used to have ridiculously priced carriers (Idea, Era, Plus - now Orange, T-Mobile, Plus). Then in 2007 (IIRC) P4 came to the market and to prop them up the government told old carriers that they have to pay them more per minute (so-called MTR rates) than to each other, all while keeping the rates for customers the same. This, together with national roaming agreement with Plus, led to situation where they didn't need to have the entire infrastructure in place by launch and they could offer lower prices than other carriers, making them competitive. 

Now, they have a customer base that is as large as of other carriers and other carriers had to engage in price war, meaning we get more choice and pay less. ",Warsaw,/r/europe/comments/aa36sv/germanys_4g_mobile_network_one_of_worst_in_europe/ecpyhvo/,uelkamewrybady,1545992482

But that is the thing, they assimilated and while they may not be able to ethnically claim that heritage technically, I think claiming it as a national focus is not a bad thing. As for Anatolian and Ponitc refugees, they have been Greek for thousands of years. I mean the ancient Greek poleis planted Colonies throughout the region, especially Ionia. So I think they have a great claim to that history seeing as that many of them have been Greek for as long as Greeks have been Greek (once again there is certainly admixture with native Anatolian populations here as well). But I believe that both of these groups have a much stronger claim (refugees perhaps more on an ethnic than national level) than a people who quite literally started claiming that history decades ago, who do not speak Greek, have little Greek ancestry and whose only claim to Greek-ness is that they live in an area that used to be a part of a Greek Kingdom/Empire.

It is based on rubles but changes to the exchange rate affects prices of ruble priced goods as well. Numerous goods sold in Russia are imported so a weaker currency means higher prices. The production of goods also often requires importing foreign equipment which makes production more expensive and thus affects the price of the end product.      

Furthermore if a weaker currency makes exporting more attractive then selling locally is less attractive so local prices may get raised on goods for which there is more demand (foreign and local combined) than supply.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/aa2zwq/russians_real_incomes_set_to_fall_again_in_2019/ecpu6v9/,ZmeiOtPirin,1545985849

2251,"&gt;and hold a hell of a lot more influence then Greenland in Denmark.


Scotland has 9% of the seats with 8% population, so yes that is very fair to Scotland.


Greenland has 1.1% of the seats in the Danish folketing with 0.97% of the population, so very similar proportionally.


If Scotland withdraw from UK, UK will have no direct influence on the Scottish parliament or government. Scotland can then choose either a Norwegian option, full EU membership, or to follow UK. As it is now, they don't have those options, but must follow whatever is decided by a majority outside Scotland, without a Veto option they would have as member of EU.


I'm not claiming that UK is undemocratic, because it's mostly a pretty good democracy, but there is no doubt Scotland would have greater autonomy outside UK than as part of UK, and there is no doubt Scotland although they have greater influence than Greenland, is still a minority. That has to abide by the decisions of a way bigger majority without a veto option.


Still as I stated earlier, I don't think Scotland will secede, and I don't say they should.


But your attempt to paint EU as less fair is ridiculous, UK can never be forced into anything they don't agree to in EU, that's what the veto power is there to prevent. But Scotland can be forced into things they don't agree to in the UK, because they are a minority, and they don't have veto power.

Again, that sound like the grandparents of your buddies up in your most northern province. Thing is, those people and those across the borders are natives to land, despite their complex admixtures (like 99% of humans) that is why their Slavic language was referred to as 'native' in Macedonia and not the Greek language. In addition, Anatolia is arguably a bigger 'ethnic mixing pot' than the Balkans, despite the Roman rule over there for many centuries.

2315,"The Finnish name for Sweden, *Ruotsi*, likely comes from *Ro√ærslandi*, the Old Norse name of the area of Roslagen, which apparently was the source of most Swedish speakers who visited Finland at the time. The other often mentioned theory is that it comes directly from the word *ro√æs-*, which is related to rowing (a method by which you cross the sea to Finland) and also the base of the name *Ro√ærslandi*. 

It was only later that Sweden named itself *Swerike*, after a different region, that of Svealand. Finns couldn't be bothered to replace their already perfectly good word. 

In fact, when those Swedish speaking rowing bastards set up camp also in the Volga region, the Finnic people still called them ruotsi / Ro√ærslandi / Roslagen, because, well, it's a perfectly good word. And so, although the Norse people themselves called the region *Gar√∞ar√≠ki*, it became commonly known as *Rus*. And this is why we call the country that later developed in the area *Russia* in most languages.

Except in Finnish of course, where it's *Ven√§j√§*. But that's a story for another day.

2391,"What's up with the insult? Anyways, it's widely accepted that CO2 concentration has diminishing marginal effects. Every climate model uses a logarithmic function. [See here, for instance:](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-12/documents/the_social_cost_of_carbon_made_simple.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjSv_uo88HfAhWLTBUIHeKeAZEQFjAQegQIBRAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw1wqUkvTKglariPHJwh2UDR&amp;cshid=1545979234433)

&gt;To model the response of the long-run equilibrium surface temperature to changes in  the atmospheric carbon concentration, we adopt the standard assumption (going back to Arrhenius [1896]) that the downward radiative flux anomaly (i.e., ‚Äúforcing‚Äù) at the top of the atmosphere increases with the logarithm of the carbon concentration, i.e., F = F ln (X XPI ) ln2 , where X is the pre-industrial carbon concentration and F is the t 2X t PI 2X  forcing from a sustained doubling of atmospheric carbon.
&gt;
&gt;The phenomenon that gives rise to this diminishing marginal effect of CO2 concentrations on the radiative forcing is known as the ‚Äúband saturation effect,‚Äù whereby further additions of a gas have a weaker impact on the net radiative forcing because ‚Äúat high concentrations, much of the light most easily absorbed by the gas will have already been absorbed even before you add the new slug of gas‚Äù (Archer and Rahmstorf 2010 p 22.) 

Following that logarithmic function, we already reached most of CO2's potential direct warming effects at over 400ppm in the atmosphere. [Here's a graphic](https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/clip_image006_thumb3.jpg) illustrating the warming effects of additional CO2 concentrations estimated by various researchers.

Do you need another source for water vapor? The mechanism is very similar. Much of the energy from light has already been absorbed, so additional particles absorb less than the first ones did. It's pretty elementary.

There have been times in Earth history where CO2 levels were 10 times higher than today, and levels as high as today not too long ago, without run-away warming:

&gt;[The present concentration is the highest in the last 800,000 and possibly even the last 20 million years.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atmosphere)

&gt;No. No it won't. Trust me. Irish people have mostly given up on Irish as a language.

And your article:

&gt;There is, however, a growing body of Irish speakers in urban areas, most coming through the Gaelscoilenna, national schools, and a small number of secondary schools, in which Irish is the sole language of instruction. These Irish-medium schools send a much higher[clarification needed] proportion of pupils on to third-level education than do ""mainstream"" schools, and it seems increasingly possible that, within a generation, non-Gaeltacht habitual users of Irish will typically be members of an urban, middle class and highly-educated minority.[35]

&gt;Irish became an official language of the EU on 1 January 2007, meaning that MEPs with Irish fluency can now speak the language in the European Parliament and at committees, 

&gt;Any expansion in the range of documents to be translated will depend on the results of the first five-year review and on whether the Irish authorities decide to seek an extension. The Irish government has committed itself to train the necessary number of translators and interpreters and to bear the related costs.[47] Derogation is expected to end completely by 2022.[

My experiences center around Siemens, but apply to most industrial-application manufacturers. The cost of changing supplier, in terms of backwards compatability, re-tooling, re-training and serviceability, means that a supplier has to fuck up pretty badly to cause a change, and in general these industries have equipment turnover so slow, that such an opportunity to fuck up happens once in a generation. Also, once you are big enough, you can generaly underprice any smaller competition, if brand-name alone doesn't get your foot in.

So it's almost impossible for a new or smaller company make a  break into this existing market, the large established players can charge stupid amount of money knowing that, and the tech moves so slow that most factories operate like museums.

Fascist societies have capitalism and private ownership combined with a heavy handed authoritarian government. 

Socialism is about equality between classes/races, which is the exact opposite of fascism. Marx wrote about a classless society where the people owned the means of production. No country has ever been anything like what Marx described, since it's impossible to achieve. Instead different countries have tried different left wing systems under the banner of socialism. Communism in the USSR for example was based around a command economy where the government planned the entire nation's economy and goals while distributing resources as they saw fit with the goal of a more equal society. Social democracy is a system that combines free market capitalism with welfare state policies to reduce inequality.

That is not...

Milan in November is meh... but you'll could plan the lakes's area between Milano and Venezia (Lago di Como, Maggiore, Iseo, Garda...maybe add some Trentino trip...) during this period, is a foodie carnival; Novello wines (first harvest red wines) chestnuts, games' meats, freshwater's fishes and local amenities... if you like hiking, is the place to go (hiking to some ""rifugio"" at 1.000 to 1.500 mts and eating some roe deer with polenta and cheeses...) oh, Verona is on the way...

If you'll be based in Pre-Alps area (AKA Milano-Venice) you can go to Austria, Slovenia, Sud Tirolo, Switzerland and even Monaco...(that, as Milano, is meh...IMHO); or go south to Modena/Bologna in less, I guess, 4h by train.

On the other side; Monaco-Genova-Torino-Geneve-Lyon...another area that could be interesting...IMHO.

Well, it was one element that the article did, in fact, list.

&gt;Harper pointed out that artificial intelligence, migration, and a healthier old age, meant countries no longer needed booming populations to hold their own. 

I agree with him that migration can substitute for or at least offset fertility.  I am very dubious on the other two.

If he's betting on AI, he's betting that the Luddite prediction is true *now*.  I don't see how that can be legitimately claimed.  Maybe one day.  But today, it's the lump-of-labor fallacy.

An healthier older population is normally a *negative*, as it means more years of non-working population to support.  If you can reduce the portion of their life that they spend retired, put 'em into work, raise retirement age, that might work for the pension issue ‚Äî fewer people to support in retirement if they aren't retiring.

2663,"&gt; Minus the fact you have a budget deficit that will have to be corrected to gain entry (raise taxes, cut services as has been cited by members of the SNP)

except that the Scottish government cannot decide how to raise taxes independently from Westminster, since the HM Customs and Revenues collects them for everyone and then Westminster redistributes them. And the Scottish government cannot borrow money like an independent government, so the current deficit is not an indication of what would happen in an independent Scotland.

&gt; you're guaranteed to use the Euro (which is 100% not a workable currency for Scotland)

not workable just because you say so, or have you got reliable experts that say so? Because the Euro works just fine for the Netherlands, Ireland, Austria, Belgium, etc.

&gt; and your voice in EU Politics will be incredibly small compared to that in the UK.

except that Scotland would have a seat in the EU council out of 27, whereas now Scotland does not have a representation in the cabinet apart from a minister for Scotland that answers to the Tory party, not to the elected Scottish government. And except that Scotland would have a veto power, which it doesn't in the current constitutional set up of the UK, hence why Scotland is being dragged out of the EU against its will, hence why Westminster has the power to disband the devolution, if it chooses to.

Ireland and France are Catholic, England and Scotland are Protestant

&gt;Modern cuisine is essentially 'Western'. I don't know enough about traditional English cuisine to say anything about that.

Scotland and England share many customs in cuisine. From the Sunday Roast to the Chip Shop, to 5 pints of lager in the pub

&gt;The Scottish Parliament uses proportional representation. You guys don't even get a parliament but that is essentially Westminster.

Scotland and England are both parts of the same Parliament, the British Parliament. Scotland has had a devolved parliament for less than 20 years, however it is still subservient to the British Parliament. Scottish MPs hold more power over the UK's politics than MSPs. However this isn't what I meant, I'm talking about overall politics. Nation wide political parties, political ideals, political structures of public services

&gt;Brexit.

Ireland has 85% support for EU membership, Scotland only had 62%. That's a big gulf. England was 53% Leave.

So Scotland was 9% higher than England and 23% lower than Ireland.

&gt;We share history with a lot of countries.

How many countries have been in a fully integrated political union with Scotland for 300 years? How many countries does Scotland border? How many countries did Scotland border 500 years ago? How many times has that border changed in 500 years? 

""Sharing history"" is not just fighting in the same wars or marrying the same families, England and Scotland have been the same country for centuries. It'd be like splitting Aragon and Castile

&gt;That is the biggest issue facing Scottish independence, but one that Scotland could overcome.

An issue that was ""solved"" by saying ""Yeah fuck it, we'll print our own notes but peg them to the GBP.""

Genius.

&gt;Nothing all that different from the rest of Europe. We're pretty good a curling mind you, but England don't really play and don't get me started on cricket.

2754,"1. No, you just change goal-posts. I have nothing against diplomacy but when you say that the UK would have won against Germany on its own, then you can't invoke diplomacy. Obviously with the help of France, USSR and USA, you won WWII. On your own? Not a fat chance.
2. Nazi Germany had conquered Norway despite your navy's best efforts. In fact, even in WWI, German navy was on its way to surpass UK's, they were clearly stronger than you on land, water and in air. You barely held them at bay when half the Luftwaffe was fighting (and winning) against USSR.
3. The Norman elite were French. They spoke French and were subjects of the French king. This is why your language has French vocabulary and not Norwegian, because for 300 years after conquering England, they carried on speaking French while their peasants spoke english. In any case, the normans were soon replaced by the Anjou dynasty, who were French noblemen.This ''they were vikings'' is my litmus test on somebody who is completely chauvinist and completely ignorant of history.
4. You were never the sole global superpower. America is, you were not. There isn't a single point in time where UK was stronger than the strongest continental power. You might argue UK was the strongest from 1815 to 1871 but even then USA was industrializing fast.

2755,"Wales still has a very strong culture, and Welsh is still a used language, moreso than Gaelic in Scotland. To further add to that, Scotland is not a monolithic Celtic culture, the way Wales (and Welsh culture) is entirely Celtic. But Wales does have a large proportion of English people living there, particularly along the borders, which used to swap between English and Welsh hands. 

Scotland is split between Celtic Highlanders, descendants of Vikings on the Northern Islands, and Lowland Scots, who are very Anglo-Saxon and came there during Northumbria's northern conquests over 1000 years ago. And also Strathclyde, which used to be part of Hen Ogledd, or the ""Old North"" in Welsh, which was essentially an area of Brythonic celtic culture, just like Cumbria in England (see the similarity between Cumbria, and the word for Wales, Cymru prounounced Kum-ree).

While the government and Westminster (and the high-ups in British culture) want Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to remain tied to the UK very much for prestige and political reasons, I don't like this whole image of the rebellious, braveheart-esque Scots chained up underneath this snooty, powerful and perfidious England.

The reality is that English people on the whole aren't fussed if Scotland stays or leaves, some pro-British people are definitely keen on keeping Scotland, but an equal amount of English nationalists want them gone and view them as a drain on resources already given too many boons by the govt. The same is true on the left wing, some English people want the UK to stay together as a brotherhood of nations, whilst others want Scotland to leave as a slap in the face to the ""Norman"" British establishment.

The really pro-British people live in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Take a look at the Rangers fanbase and you'll see more UK flags than anywhere else in Great Britain. British Unionism has its own incredibly strong flavour and culture in Scotland and Northern Ireland that isn't similar anywhere else in the UK. Its very much tied into protestantism, and these areas are much more religious than England. 


Wales does have Welsh independence movements, but the reason Wales doesn't have a strong anti-British trend like Scotland and NI is because Wales has the prevailing attitude that as the poorest part of the UK they couldn't survive outside the UK. Plus Wales and Cornwall have Brythonic Celtic culture, which is somewhat less tied to the struggles against the British Empire seen in Northern Ireland with Goidleic celtic culture.

Though that doesn't change a lot. Gerrymandering is a way to control the misrepresentativeness of a FPTP system. The scenario of a 25% candidate winning over a 75% one can still happen in US presidential elections without gerrymandering but it's harder to make it that way. Still I imagine there can be other inventive ways to  achieve the same goals as gerrymandering.     


Besides I wasn't talking just of the presidency, a dictator would start by having his loyal party writing legislation and gerrymandering is relevant there.

Individuals such as Stilicho, Gaudentius and Aetius were all ""Barbarian"". In Gaul, ""Babarian"" Foederati ended rebellions by ""Roman"" Bagaudae. Even Alarics rebellion can and should be framed as one caused by disappointment with his career opportunities instead of a ""Barbarian"" one.

3132,"Source for what? That Diocletian's reforms were mostly administrative? That's easily googled information...even his wiki page would say it. 

Or did you mean that barbarian recruits in the legion damaged the empire? Well let's see:

In 212 the Edict of Caracella granted citizenship to all residents within the Empire, whereas before the majority of citizens were from Italy. This of course ended the distinction of exclusively Roman legions and non-Roman auxiliaries. 20 years later the Crisis of the Third Century began. Studying history you quickly learn that there are no such things as coincidences. 

Before the Edict, one of the ways to gain citizenship was through service in the military. That meant that citizens (remember, the only ones who made up the legions, the backbone of the army) had gone through years and years of service to Rome. It was proof of loyalty and experience. Post-edict, this was obviously no longer the case. Anyone could join the legions. 

Then you had the use of barbarian armies as essentially mercenaries in exchange for settlements within the empire's borders. This had massive consequences, look up the Battle of Adrianople or the Gothic Sack of Rome.

For decades funded by USSR and to this day supported by many leftist organizations. To this day, Fatah is a proud member of Socialist International, along with almost all mainstream social democratic political parties of developed world.

For many years, Fatah provided training to leftist terror cells in the west, including but not limited to Red Army Faction, perpetrators of several high profile attacks in Germany. 

And before you start with ""They are secular, just antizionist!"" rhetoric, lets remember they introduced Islam as state religion and sharia as base of law into the [Basic Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_law#Articles_of_the_Basic_Law) of Palestinian territories.

3253,"Sorry for replying so late. According to my limited knowledge, I dont think there is a problem with Germany running a trade surplus. Textbook economics tend to say that it is good that countries in Germany\`s situation runs trade surpluses so that capital can flow to poorer countries where investment needs are higher. The problem is more the size of the trade surplus which in the last years have reached up to 10 percent of GDP. This does not just reflect the competitivness of German business, but also spesific policy choices taken by authorities. And such a high surplus can create dangerous global inbalances which can lead to financial problems or crisis in other countries. This does not mean that German savings was the cause of financial excesses in southern Europe, Ireland or the US before the 2008 crisis but it helped fuel these bubbles. Here is a very good read on the subject [https://voxeu.org/article/germany-s-capital-exports-under-euro](https://voxeu.org/article/germany-s-capital-exports-under-euro)

The Hartz labour reforms are crucial in many explanations for why the German trade surplus increased the way it did in the 2000s. The argument tends to be that the hartz reforms led to a repression of wage growth, this then led to surpressed domestic demand and a increase in german corporate savings. Instead of investing these savings domesticly, they instead invested less and send the savings abroad. This hiighlights an important point that the increase in german savings was mostly a increase in corporate savings not housholds. Although there are many arguments on the rigth that says the hartz reforms were necessery, i dont think anyone should think the lower investment rates by german companies is a good thing. German productivity growth has held up but the capital stock has increased shockingly little ,and the US has since the 90 closed the small lead germany had in productivity. My final point is first that there is no point for the German goverment to add to the savings surplus by running budget surpluses(they should at least run a balanced budget) Secondly there could be an argument that public investment could facilitate more private investment. [https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/germany-digital-gap/](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/germany-digital-gap/). And finaly my whole point was just that although germany has a fantastic economy compared to others it  should probably do even better, and the goal of the goverment should be to increase the incomes of germans, not cutting debt.

It doesn't happen in America, that's true; it happens in Spain and France, that's why Nayr in the article on Spain was specifically told ‚ÄúGo back to your fucking country‚Äù, because she's literally not considered Spanish.

is incorrect - and if you doubt that, ask people that were actually raised in Europe, in Spain or in France; ask r/AskEurope, r/Spain or r/France, because while I'm sure the posters there are not proud that this is the case, they won't deny that it is true.

This might be surprising but post-modernist thinkers do not believe that every culture is as good as any other. It might command that you to question parts of Norwegian culture - to make sure they are actually logical - but it would never say that ISIS is just as right. This might help you build a better Norway but never to become ISIS.

Also, if your speaking of natural law - objectivity and wellbeing have no place. Natural law elevates what is natural above such considerations. In particular wellbeing is used mostly by utilitarianists - they also use objectivity, but they rubbish the idea of natural law.

Congratulations once again, you have no idea what you're talking about, but continue talking.

Mothers don't need to prove their innocence. They are innocent by default. The government needs to prove their guilt.

It's just how the legal system works.

You (you as in the the government) needs to prove this. And they just can't unless they had them under surveillance

&gt;I don't need to provide evidence for anything. These children are innocent - no matter what. They need to come home and get adequate care. Which we can and should provide.

Once again, not you, the government. And in order to get the children away from their mothers, a lot of proof is needed.

I don't want this picture to paint us or other countries in the ''legalization'' group as better because of ''freedums''. In the case of prostitution there exist a lot of problems that require careful balancing of individual freedoms and actual realities. Laws that permit prostitution but put no pressure on the purchaser are bad for the sellers, because the purchaser feels entitled to abusing the person, while, for example, the Swedish model is superior in this specific case, because the power balance is distorted - the purchaser is ''at the mercy'' so-to-say of the seller, which is, in my opinion, better than the other scenario.

That is a pretty stupid argument. I could also ask why there are  pretty much no placenames in Germany that predate the Romans. The answer is that there were no big cities at the time in this part of Europe and if there were place names, no one wrote them down. Also, the Germanic tribes abandoned this territory, so why should there be any place names from this time.

&gt; I don't claim that Germanics were never present east of the Oder in ancient times. They were, but they left no clear traced of their existance there.

Except that they did leave traces: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wielbark_culture &amp; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Przeworsk_culture

&gt; Lastly, why do we equate East Germanics with Germans?

No one does. It is stupid to project the modern nation concept back on ancient tribes. But the same is true for Poles, too.

&gt; Hell, Swedes have a better claim for Gothic heritage than the Germans do - Goths arrived from there (or Gotland).

All Germanic tribes originate from Scandinavia and they probably were still pretty close at the time in terms of language and culture. But no one has claim at East Germanic heritage, because no East Germanic tribes survived. Swedish as a North Germanic language is not any closer to Gothic than German as a West Germanic language.

4074,"&gt; In my experience, Pakistani immigrants tend to be very nationalistic.

I honestly disagree, Turks in Western countries are nationalistic, Pakistanis are just... something else? 

&gt;  Some are nationalistic to such an extent that they openly despise British culture. Many Pakistanis marry only each other, encouraging Pakistanis to think themselves as different from the society around them. This effect is further amplified by Islamism, which in many ways operates very similarly to nationalism.

I agree with this, but I think 'nationalism' is the wrong term because it's not about them loving Pakistan or anything, it's just them sticking to themselves (and other Muslims) and disliking British culture. 

They identify as British too, and see themselves as British as anyone else. What they have created is almost like a sub-culture, rather than anything to do with modern Pakistan. 

Racist, bigoted, hateful, Islamist? Yes. Nationalistic? Not quite, I don't think. This is just my opinion anyway.

And we all know, they will not get rid of 'm any time soon.

You seem to be reacting as if French people were like ""These people are French and it's a French achievement and Polish people can't take pride in it"" and putting yourselves as victims when no one is actively denying the achievement of a Polish person. We are just saying that those people who happen to be both Polish (as their roots, origin and culture they grew up in) and French to some extent (adoptive country, culture they got to learn and love later) did great things.

Imo a Frenchman saying that those people are only French and Poland shouldn't take pride in it are ignorant or stupid (or both). On the other hand, reacting negatively to anyone suggesting that France has a part in it is also disinguenuous.

1) candidate registration deadline is the 4th of February, (70 days since the 26th)

2) candidate lists have to be completed by the 9th of February (75 days)

3) the election campaign must be over by the 30th of March (124 days)

4) the elections themselves are on the 31st of March (125 days).

So, the only thing to do with the elections that would have to shift because of the initial 60 day term would be the official start of the election campaign (31st of December), which would have been moved by three weeks.

&gt;The hypersonic glide vehicle, dubbed Avangard, is expected to enter Russia‚Äôs arsenal by 2020, according to sources with direct knowledge of a **U.S. intelligence assessment**

&gt; Sources familiar with **U.S. intelligence reports** assess that the Russian hypersonic glide vehicles are equipped with onboard countermeasures that are able to defeat even the most advanced missile-defense systems. The weapons are also highly maneuverable and, therefore, unpredictable, which makes them difficult to track.

&gt;Of the six weapons Putin unveiled in March, CNBC has learned that two of them will be ready for war by 2020, according to sources with direct knowledge of **U.S. intelligence reports**


&gt; Russia successfully tested the weapon twice in 2016, according to sources with direct knowledge of a **U.S. intelligence report**

&gt; One **U.S. intelligence** report, according to a source, noted that the hypersonic glide vehicles would join Russia's arsenal by 2020, a significant step that would enable the Kremlin to surpass the U.S. and China in this regard.

This report is quite close in time to recent reports of Russian claiming that Ukraine is preparing a  ""provocation"" together with independent reports from other side that Russia gathers forces on the border of Ukraine. 

With all three sources, now I do not feel I can believe in the impossibility or unimaginability of Russia attacking mainland Ukraine. Not anymore.

Kinda idiotic if you think about the nuclear arms race or the many ideological violent conflicts like the one in Korea, or Europe which ended up divided with literal walls being built to deny people their freedoms. Does he really, in his mind, try to attract any sympathy with that in Europe?

It's like the only value Russia has left after collapse of communism, is being anti-USA. Not only does it seem, at least here, as a lame remnant of Soviet times, it also reveals a weak character if you only are against something but don't actually have an alternative to offer.

Oh, and the most ridiculous part is when he actually talks about ""interests of all states being recognized"" which is a 180 degree difference compared to how he treats his neighbouring countries. Sure, interests of *all*\* states, but states only meaning big countries (preferably those with nuclear weapons), not those pesky tiny artificial fake and gay countries that exist only to serve either us or another great powers as mere pawns or buffer zones.

And they crumbled this year so. At any rate we export to Russia 9 times less than we import. That is absolutely insane.

Closer than Jordan, they have also a military airbase in Lebanon (Rayak).

You are also comparing apples with oranges here: In terms of intervention, attacking a military base is different than attacking soldiers (here Kurds) allied to France. Turkey would basically take the risk to actually have a full war against France and trigger a massive intervention. And it's not like they cannot logistically speaking send an appropriate intervention, France's biggest maritime base is also in the mediterranean (Toulon) and it would take them few days to land in Turkey or Syria.

ISIS has been eliminated and with that the US justification for occupying half of Syria. 

In the end there is nothing particularly good about the SDF. Sure they fought against ISIS and got some PR out of it, but  so has the FSA, the SAA, the TFSA, the Iranians, Iraqis, hell even Al-Qaeda fought them. Take that away what do you have?

The fall of the USSR was a major positive event, period. Even for us Romanians, after the USSR had dictated aspects of our external and internal policy for decades.

They were the ones to establish a regime that would confiscate the land peasants have been working on for their whole life and send them to the city to work in an insalubrious factory. The regime that would rewrite two millennia of history to add its bullshit motives to every event in history.

The regime that would imprison the pre-war leaders and intellectuals, the post-war political opposition and anyone else who would dare to speak up the slightest bit against the regime. They would be sent to prisons where they would be kept with just enough food and water not to die so they could torture them, [""reeducate them""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pite»ôti_Prison) and sometimes send them to work in miserable conditions for the administration's megalomaniac projects. Happened to politicians, happened to priests, happened to writers, happened to ordinary people. And there's much more horrible things about this time.

So don't let any fools tell you how bad it is that the USSR has fallen.

Yohannes was a coward, when he fought with the Egyptians Minilik sent him 60,000 warriors to help him. When he fought with the Sudanese his head was cut off while escaping.

His great grandson betrayed the country, https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jui3HjDMVds

The Tigray hagos and sibhat also were traitors. The books key anbessa (red lion) and Habesha Oddesea also speak about more trechery. Mengesha and Alula sold off Eritrean patriotic fighters hoping to be picked a pawn. This is all due to uncontrollable greed, hunger, a naturally trecherous nature that Tellez described so perfectly.

Dont even talk about land, something that was already sold off by Yohannes and Alula. Minilik simply confirmed what was done.

Why do you think the entire country calls your kind bandas? Because you are traitors!

Just like they call you all Anbeta kortami, because you survived crunching locusts while you were starved out by your own tplf.

Every king even as far back as Zera Yacob despised your kind for their inferiorty complex, trechery, and lies. You were known as servants where ever you went until your Tplf stole.

When Amhed Gragne invaded did you know, one of the Tigray regional heads helped him??? Then the following king chased him away, forgave his family and replaced his son. Do you know what the son did? He started fabricating stories to the portugese and gossiping as usual to create conflict between them. This is what you have always been! It is your epi-genetic stamp.

I am Amhara, dont envy, but you are a dirty repulsive Tigray, despised by all those around you and so Oromos are a million times better than you.

All Ethiopians participated in Adwa but Tigrays were mostly traitors and bandas, that's how you earned one of your many slurs. I can list you how many were traitors and how they were saved by other Ethiopians who were with Minilik. How the hell does that make Minilik what you said? He was a leader he got a traditional army ready for war. You really need to fix that buttbrain of yours. ""Reasoning"" you dont even know what that means.

Zera Yacob hated Tigrays because they were plotting as always and he literally called them the ""devil's drums"" which is the perfect name lol...

King Amda Tsion also had a slur for you, i mean who didnt?

Bahire Negash Yisak is NOT a Tigrean, he was an Eritrean! Behire Negash was an honorary title given to Shewan nobles who took back Eritrea as regional regents of the north and they were meant to rule over you, which is why they have always seen you as servants the same way Amharas have always seen you.

And no i'm talking about the Tigray son who after being forgiven for his family's trechery, again tried to create problems for the king through gossip. He told the portugese that the king planned to arrest them and did many other shitty things.

If some one did a state space of your Ethnic character through out history, the deepest and widest attractor would be your lies, trechery, plotting, servile nature, and narrow mindedness combined. Even the money your kind stole cant buy you respect, because only truth and character are respectworthy and you have neither.

You are a Tigray and an Agaw, you combine the worst of both traitors, that is why you are as you are. Did you even forget Biru the traitor?

Your reasoning is rather special. And kinda not correct.  There's so much wrong with this statement.

&gt;After triggering Article 50 the EU had an obligation to negotiate a Brexit agreement and that has not happened and they are refusing to negotiate at all.

They shouldn't accept shit decisions. Biggest problem is that British parliament if filled with a bunch of retarded benchbarkers, unwilling to accept any reasonable deal with the EU. Secondly, it's far easier for Britain to come with a Brexit deal then 27 European nations. Most of these nations aren't even interested in a Brexit deal, so why would they spend money and time on creating a deal?

&gt;The lesson for other nations is to never do business with the EU.

The lesson is never to deal with retarded UK,  they were given a bunch of privileges and are still whining they were exploited by the EU.

4846,"We are talking about ship age. Not firepower.

But if you want to talk about firepower, then you forget that Kuznetsov is not an aircraft carrier, but instead an heavy aircraft-carrying missile cruiser and as a missile cruiser it carries a full complement of P-700 heavy anti-ship cruise missiles. These 10 meter long,  supersonic, sea-skimming, swarm missiles, deliver 500kT thermonuclear warheads at a range of up to 700km.  A single Kuznestov could wipe out an entire Nimitz carrier battle group, destroyer escorts and all, with just its missiles. The aircraft are a bonus. That alone makes a Kuznetsov carry more firepower than all of the Nimitz carriers combined. 

Not only does Kuznetsov-class carry a more powerful AShM arsenal than any NATO surface ship in existence, but it also has a substantial array of SAM, CIWS and ASW armaments - several times more numerous and heavier than on any Nimitz class.

US **is** honoring an alliance. A much older and more important one - with Turkey. If anything, abandoning Turkey (a NATO ally of over 70 years!) in favor of some new stateless militia would have been what destroys confidence in the US alliances. 

You make it sound like the Kurds did the US a favor. Its the other way around. They would have been all destroyed by ISIS if it weren't for the US assistance - whether in Syria or Iraq. They would have been overrun by the SAA had it not been for the US presence. The US did what it could and the SDF should be grateful for the help it had received.

4860,"&gt;Russians already have a better country which is progressing in most ways.

Russia could be doing a lot better if it dropped the bizarre dreams of imperialism with its neighbors. Ukrainians wanted the EU association agreement instead of closer ties with Russia and the EEU which literally led to your country invading theirs. So when you say 

&gt;	As for European stability, it‚Äôs just as important to Russia as it is to Europe

I have trouble believing we share a common definition of stability. Because as it stands, your country occupies land in now 3 European countries, and has been a constant factor in destabilizing the European Union. 

&gt;	Russia borders those European countries and conducts trade with them.

And of course, those land grabs kind of make me wonder how important that trade really is. Because from what I‚Äôve seen, Russia is willing to take massive shocks to the economy and recession in order to A) screw over Ukraine and B) ‚Äúreclaim‚Äù Crimea. 

In my opinion Russia doesn‚Äôt prioritize its economy at all when direct power is concerned. Which is, in my opinion, the most ironic thing because if Russia would give up the military ambitions and prioritize the economy Russia could have so much more power over its neighbors than it currently has, and those neighbors wouldn‚Äôt hate Russia for it. Even after your 2008 invasion of Georgia there were *a lot* of people, especially in Europe, questioning why we still needed NATO. But lo, 2014 comes and you i) shoot yourself in the foot economically because turns out people don‚Äôt like when countries invade their neighbors, ii) completely validate in the minds of every NATO state the raison d‚Äô√™tre for the alliance, and iii) completely sabotaged any and all goodwill between Russia and the west, especially after y‚Äôall killed hundreds of Dutch citizens and then acted like y‚Äôall had no idea how ‚Äú‚Äùseparatists‚Äù‚Äù got their hands on Buk missiles.

4928,"&gt;Not on its own, either. Put it on a petri dish and goes nowhere.

A baby cannot become sapient on its own, either. _Put a baby in a storage room without food and it goes nowhere._
The unborn child has the potential to become sapient (it is already human), it just needs to be fed, which is done through the placenta.

&gt;If the sperm cell is not the fetus, then the child is not the embryo either.

From how stupid your statement sounded to me, I will assume we are working with different definitions of child. Let us clear this up:
'child', where I am employing this term, means ""descendant"". You can be an unborn child or a 21 year old child, as you are _someone_'s child always.

Now, the sperm cell is not the fetus. The sperm cell does not grow into a fetus. The cell resulting from the joining of a male reproductive cell and a female reproductive cell is the one that can grow into a fetus. This describes 2 cells becoming one, one which can become sapient. An infant turning into an adult is not comparable to this. It is mere growth, not joining.",,/r/europe/comments/a964lj/toddler_dies_in_circumcision_in_italy/eck8u19/,AdmiralGomes,1545792223

Funny, since someone from south-eastern Serbia probably can't understand someone from north-western Croatia at all. Even Serbs from central Serbia would struggle greatly with that dialect since mutual intelligibility with the standardized language is very low.

5019,"??? This is just simply denying reality. If there is a demand for it, the market will move there. 

A free market is simply the expression of the participants in it (individuals and organisations such as companies and institutions). It's forced altruism. Service providers have to provide what individuals and other actors ask for, or they'll go under. In essence they are altruistic. 

A demand for cheap housing means that there is a group ready to pay for cheap housing, and an opportunity for companies to make a profit. Through that you get affordable housing. 

If you actually knew what you were talking about you would know that the margins for extreme luxury housing is actually quite often lower than mid or low level houses. 

Look at several worker cities in USA, for example. There is no shortage of cheap housing, there. See Detroit or Cleveland, for example.

It definitely is, if you're concerned with the wellbeing of the child. Or are you only concerned with the wellbeing of the child until it's out of the womb?

&gt;You were willing when you started so you must stick by your decision.

Well no, the people who get an abortion are *by definition* not willing to have a child. And they are taking their responsibility by ensuring the egg cell won't develop into a child.

&gt;Sapience (or potential future sapience, in this case).

Define sapience. Regardless, every gamete has the potential to grow into a human being. By that reasoning, everyone is a mass murderer because every human discards very large numbers of gametes throughout their lifetime.

5184,"No. Germany has its own weird history. Christmas as a day for gifts was invented by protestants as a replacement for St. Nicholas' day, which had been the main gift receiving day for children. From what I heard (didn't check), Luther wanted to introduce Christkind (Baby Jesus) as a replacement.

However, the character of St. Nicholas being an old man was so popular, that protestants simply started calling him Weihnachtsmann (Christmas man) and had him come a few weeks later, on Christmas Eve.

Meanwhile, Catholics decided that they really liked presents on Christmas, too, so they adopted the Christkind tradition. Since they still had St. Nicholas on St. Nicholas' day, Weihnachtsmann wasn't as appealing.

So the Protestants invented a new gift bringer who is now celebrated by Catholics.

If course the split is not 100% on religion and depends a lot on local and family traditions, too.

Weihnachtsmann and Santa Claus pretty much look alike (except Weihnachtsmann isn't usually pictured as chubby), so this tradition is mixing heavily with the American pop cultural one.

Tyranical goverments have a tendency to crack down on internal political organizations exactly to make a change of regime as chaotic and difficult as possible, which acts as a deterent. The best example of where they usually fail are military coups, where the officers have the competence and structure to replace the government without much chaos or opportunism.

But for any revolution to be trully successful, a power structure has to be grown and set to replace whatever you tear down.

And if it's your fault, you should just accept it and not do anything about it?

Real-life condom efficiency is closer to 85% - https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom/how-effective-are-condoms

And it's not like if we start politicizing stuff we suddenly solve everything. Because then we start having local sports fans fighting each other over politicial affiliation, and companies dictating voting patterns to employees. This is when everyone doesn't start treating rumours and conspiracy theories as political realities.

5407,"&gt;Although that's true, you must acknowledge that the Irish haven't exactly accepted the current framework either and never really came close until the GFA

The Troubles started because the nationalist community in NI were treated as second class citizens. They tried to start a peaceful civil rights movement and were brutally supressed by loyalist paramilitaries, corrupt law enforcement, and later the British Army.

The suggestion that the unionist community would be treated the same way in a United Ireland is completely ridiculous. Most people in the south don't really care about Northern Ireland. We support a UI in a vague sort of 'that would be nice someday' sort of way.

&gt; A United Ireland means that the British people within Northern Ireland will want protections

There already are protections for freedom of religion and expression in Ireland. With a few notable exceptions, modern Ireland is considerably more secular than Northern Ireland.

&gt;and maybe even their own possibility and legal opportunity to secede themselves

If a United Ireland occurs, then by definition a majority of people in NI will have voted for it. What are you suggesting, that unionist majority counties should have the option of forming an even smaller statelet? At a certain point these minute territorial divisions and gerrymandering become ridiculous. 

&gt;Do you see the Irish people and government supporting that?

I could certainly see a regional parliament being formed in Northern Ireland, at least for the first ten or twenty years. Obviously if any of this happens there would have to be discussion between the Dail and the Northern Assembly.

&gt;People in Ireland seem to assume that they all just pack up their bags and move to the UK

Absolutely no one thinks that. A few of the hardliners probably will go, but most unionists have farms, businesses and other roots that they aren't going to just abandon.

&gt;even the person you've replied to has received xenophobic comments so it's not really a warm welcome either

He received negative responses because he literally advocated armed resistance to the results of a popular referendum. That sort of paranoid siege mentality is an example of the worst mindsets of the unionist community.

This is the first time I ever saw a Hungarian say that their gripe is that the border went too far westward instead of the fact that it moved at all.

When I look at the old Hungarian kingdom's borders the only territory I think they lost quite unjustly was Southern Slovakia, that was only given to the Czechoslovaks for the resources found there, to prop up the new state as a regional power. Magyars did not hold a majority in their own kingdom, that's the real reason for their huge losses, the treatment of minorities went both ways and it's pointless to discuss who was the bigger evil imo, and I don't think that Magyars had it worse in Romania than Romanians had it in AH anyways. Some Magyars got their surnames changed to latin sounding ones, Romanians weren't allowed to practice Orthodoxism and didn't have their language recognized. Those practices were wrong but they never got the the level you see on /r/Hungary , where people unironically suggest that we'll only ever be satisfied when we'll put you all in gas chambers and that we're nothing but worms and subhuman slavs. The vitriol of our retards on unmoderated forums pales to the one exhibited by your retards on a moderated one.

And it's not like communist Romania was a cakewalk for everyone else, and I don't think that the Magyar communism treated you guys that much better. Especially since the Soviet occupation lasted till the collapse of the Soviet Union in Hungary, while ours ended by 1958.

5492,"&gt; I mean, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I certainly know and studied INF stated history but why then did most African and Asian and South American nation stopped getting these loans as much as they could? The IMF has an interesting history.

The IMF certainly has an interesting history. It's goal is to prevent financial crises and ensure governments can get any form of loan. The IMF doesn't function as the primary moneylender but rather as an emergency moneylender. A nation's primary goal should be to ensure a healthy income balance and ask other nations for loans if needed.

Again, underdeveloped nations prefer BRICS since BRICS nations bribe the national leadership. Unlike the IMF, the BRICS aren't interested in preserving the status quo. The BRICS challenge the status quo and act reckless in their behavior. These loans don't serve to prevent crises or international conflicts. They serve to extend the BRICS influence.

&gt; just so we‚Äôre clear and I know about the debt traps, what I‚Äôm saying is that the IMF is also doing that but comes with more strings attached.

It's because the UN and the west both likes international agreements. The BRICS all violate international agreements and concepts. They don't care about sovereignty, look at Russia in Crimea. They don't care about self-determination, look at China oppressing the Uyghers and Tibetans. Brazil is growing increasingly authoritarian, adopting fascist-like politics. South Africa is re-instating the Apartheid regime, but this time with blacks benefiting. India is the only nation doing fine.

The BRICS don't care about financial stability on the long term, they don't care world unity, they don't care about long-term solutions.

&gt;Im sorry, setting yourself up completely open for business for western interests when you‚Äôre a tiny economy is to welcome the pillage of your ressources for very little wealth gain. The IMF did indeed, lend larger sums than the whole GDP of these countries, leading to irregular situations.

Allowing BRICS companies to pillage the economy is any better? Sure, the IMF is harsh in their conditions but it at least focuses on international relationships and long-term solutions.

The BRICS bank isn't even an alternative (in terms of world organization) to the IMF, as the BRICS are always entitled to at least 55% of the voting power. 

It's green and humanitarian declarations just masquerades neo-Imperialistic ambitions. The BRICS have always been able to masquerade their acts as benevolent, while it merely destroys foreign nations in the long term and enriches the BRICS themselves.

'' Im sorry, setting yourself up completely open for business for western interests when you‚Äôre a tiny economy is to welcome the pillage of your ressources for very little wealth gain''

In the long term, these nations need to be able to compete with western companies. And governments need to be able to make money. Foreign investments are necessary to solve debt crises. Either you exploit your population, or you allow foreign companies to exploit your people. Dictatorships prefer the former, as they don't have to deal with foreign influences.

&gt;You‚Äôre just like, bricks bad IMF good and your nuance is clearly lacking.

No, I'm saying we shouldn't allow totalitarian and authoritarian regimes to form the new world order. Currently, the West is the only free world bloc. We don't know about the ambitions of these governments, currently the BRICS loans sound all nice and fine, but the no strings attached shit is fishy.

5502,"Okay, a difficult debate again... 

&gt;You forgot the little unconvinient part whereafter Trianon half a million of Hungarians have left the territory and moved to Hungary 

Eh, except the 1919 census showed almost the same number as the 1921 one and it took place before Trianon. [maps](http://forumhistoriae.sk/documents/10180/71311/tisliar.pdf) 

&gt; while simultaniously a lot former peasants moved into the cities from the countyside, while also a lot of slovaks moved back into the vacant homes from what is today southern-eastern Hungary. (Who moved there in the 18th century to repopulate areas after the turks.) 

No, this doesn't explain the numbers. Peasants slowly moved into the cities before 1918 too, then more in the interwar period, after the mentioned census. That's how, for example, Slovak population of Bratislava grew later. What you are describing is more like post-WWII period, unrelated. I don't know if you are confused of what.

&gt;Also a lot of people didn‚Äôt declare their nationality because Hungarians and Germans were handled as if they were enemies of the state, many stripped of their estates as repatations. (Something that never happened in Hungary just because of their nationality)

Again, you are describing post-WWII period, oh my God.

&gt; But I‚Äôm glad you have searched so long to find what? 6 instances of it in minor towns. Hope you didn‚Äôt waste too much on your time. 

Lol, I can find so many instances as you want. Why do you think I choose random examples all over the country?

&gt; I‚Äôm sure Pozsonys 15% Slovakian number was just false, in reality it was 95% just like today, they just didn‚Äôt want to declare it! 

Except it was always a German majority city, not Hungarian. If you knew the circumstances of Bratislava becoming the capital of Slovakia, you would know its multiethnic composition was a disadvantage compared to Martin or ≈Ωilina and it became a capital because of strategic reasons, it's size and infrastructure.

&gt; Also you don‚Äôt really want to get into population numbers because that would show you ‚Äúslovakizated‚Äù cities from 1920 to 1945 faster than we did in a thousand years, mostly because contrary what you learn in school, slovakians never faced institutionalised discrimination just because they were slovaks, you could go through university without speaking Hungarian, now in Slovakia you can‚Äôt even get a high shool diploma without speaking slovakian. 

What? Try to learn and read more about this topic, other commenters already wrote something. But the university part is quite amusing.  

&gt;Something that I never understood, something that nobody could answer me, what could have been the benefit for them to declare another identity, it was anonimous and withot reprecussions. And if there was, wasn‚Äôt that true the othet way around aswell? Because we have precedent how Hungarians faced discrimination in the republic just for being Hungarians, while you didn‚Äôt set any examples other than vague ‚Äúmuh magyarozation‚Äù which meant they learned Hungarian is school.

Again, if something is vague, then your knowledge about Magyarization and what happened when and why. 

&gt;And if there was, wasn‚Äôt that true the othet way around aswell?

Yes, there was. But it varied a lot, depending on the period. We were talking about the beginning of the 20th century. Then it were mostly Slovaks, who were magyarized (voluntarily to an extent) before and after the creation of the new state they felt that in that moment it's better to ""return"" to their original identity. It was a complicated period and it's not easy to generalize. However, to believe that 1910 census shows a true image of ethnic composition of Hungary is a little bit delusional.

5531,"&gt;Firstly, I don't think there's such an obligation for Serbia before joining the EU, especially as some members of the EU don't recognize Kosovo either. 

Not officially, but in reality there is. Otherwise, what else is holding us back? I mean, I know of all the issues we have, but if that mattered Croatia, Romania and Bulgaria wouldn't be members either.

&gt;Secondly, there's no point in talking about ""giving up a large chunk of our territory and resources"" because you've effectively already lost them. Can you imagine a realistic scenario in which Kosovo returns to Serbia's control? Because I can't.

As long as it's legally still our's we have a chance. A lot of people back in the 17th century couldn't have imagined a scenario where we were free and had Kosovo back but it happened. The only thing keeping Kosovo this way is NATO, and they won't last forever.

&gt;How do you measure power? Militarily, your positions might hold some truth, but economically or politically, Russia's not even close to that. Its economy is the size of Italy and politically, it's among the most disliked countries in the world. Let's be honest, the only thing it's often looked towards is just anti-Westernism, but if you have nothing to offer besides being anti-something, it probably reveals your hollow character.

And the US is the most hated country in the world but also the most powerful. Great powers are always hated, cause in order to be such powers they give plenty of reasons for you to hate them, a small and irrelevant country doesn't. Besides the military they have the largest nuclear stockpile in the world as well as being a permanent member of UNSC. It also has a solid economy and large enough population, plus plenty of resources and international influence, it was also one of only 2 countries to be a proper superpower.

I mean, name me a country other than the US and China that is more powerful than Russia on the world stage? There are none.

&gt;The EU in a whole has no clear position about what status should Kosovo hold. The EU is interested in a stable Balkan region and that includes its countries getting along. Let's be honest, Balkans is still very volatile. Bosnia still feels like a quickly stitched-up country which doesn't quite function as a real country. Macedonia is in constant danger of ethnic conflicts. Then there's Serbia and Kosovo. The EU doesn't want a member which would have some major territorial demands or which could ignite new conflicts. Whether that's achieved by recognition of Kosovo or some other deals (e.g. exchanging ethnic territories), is not important.

Again, officially it doesn't, but in reality they clearly want Kosovo to be recognized. Those 5 may not recognize it but most do, including the most powerful country and the one that we've mainly been negotiating with, Germany. And yes, the EU wants stability since that makes control easier now, but they also wanna keep Kosovo independent.

&gt;This is very unpragmatic and characteristic of less developed societies, to be honest. Even we don't do that, we might dislike Russia, but it's not like Chechnya or Turkey would have been buddies due to that. Even with Ukraine, we understand what's being a neighbour of Russia is like, understand that they suffer from Russian aggression, but that doesn't erase the fact that Ukraine itself has been horribly ruled and it has been so stupid itself to allow Russian bases to operate there that resulted in annexation of Crimea. We also welcome Ukraine becoming closer to the West, but we wouldn't accept a very corrupt and poor country joining EU out of just dislike for Russia. It still needs to reform itself and start functioning as a normal state. What is more, Russia might get along with Serbia, but it's not like we're going to block its accession to the EU because of that. However, should Serbia's foreign policy lean to extreme pro-Russia sentiments, that would be another issue.

I disagree. It's not even so much an enemy of my enemy thing as it is us sympathizing with them since they suffered the same fate we did, since they too suffered at the ends of the West. 

&gt;I don't think you understand what you're talking about. You don't even know China. It's again pure anti-Westernism that's making the choice for you. You live in Europe, you most likely share many values Europeans have. Why would you side with an autocratic state on the other side of the globe, instead of trying to build a more cohesive continent? China is a rising power, but it will not grow to become some dictator of the Earth. The EU and the USA will remain powerful players as well, and you happen to be next to them.

I know China well enough. We've had good relations with them for decades, stemming from us both being communist but not USSR aligned. They also really love our WWII Partisan movies. They also suffered during the 1999 bombing when their embassy was destroyed. I hear that was a major turning point for them, pretty much killing of the pro-Western youth movement. 
So I know China, and they've been good to us so far. 

You think I care about them being autocratic and what not? I care about how they treat my country, and China certainly treats it better than the West. The West bombed us less than 20 years ago for fucks sake, they blame us for the all the wars here in the 90s, they demonized us and painted us as the sole criminals and they want us to follow their narrative. They want us to feel sorry and apologize for our crimes while the other's get away with their's, thanks to the West's own court in the Hague. China is a far better friend of our's then the West. So why should I like the West more? And what values do you mean? Bombing us for not dancing to their tune?

I don't expect them to become a world dictator, not even the US achieved that. But I expect them to become the strongest country on the planet with influence all across the globe, and I wanna be on their train before that happens. The US will certainly remain a strong player. The EU I don't see surviving much longer, maybe 20 more years. And as we move on the distance will matter less and less. The US is far away from the ME but they're influence on it is obvious. 

All in all I get the impression that you want us to conveniently ignore everything the West did to us, including a fucking bombing campaign, cause money and some stupid values. ",Rep. Srpska,/r/europe/comments/a8y7fl/serbia_breaks_gentlemens_agreement_in_un_vote_on/ecirb9k/,A3xMlp,1545747751

The 1868 minority law  stated ""every student should learn in their mother tongue"" and that ""every citizen should be able to conduct official matters in their language"". Until 1882 minority schools didn't have to teach Hungarian at all. But even the 1882 amendment said that all citizens should have the possibility, not obligation to learn Hungarian. The 1904 law wanted to change this and make sure all student get a working command of Hungarian. Finally the 1907 lex Appony is what Slovaks etc typically think of as it made it an absolute obligation for all schools to teach Hungarian and for students to learn it, and failure to do so could lead to the closure of the school. But this obviously lasted for just one decade.  

Also far from all schools were closed. In 1880 39% of schools had only minority, 15% had dual language education. In 1905 30% of schools taught minority languages, and further 13% had minority language courses. By 1905 about 1/3 of Slovak students went to Hungarian-only schools.

LMAO, that was done in december 1918, when it was obvious Hungary lost WW1, so they desperately did a bunch of concessions to Rusyns.

Too little, too late. Hungarians didn't want to talk about autonomy before losing WW1. The Rusyns remembered that, and were not fooled by Hungarians.

Later, when Hitler destroyed Czechoslovakia, the Rusyns decided to declare independence rather than join Hungary. This is why Horthy had to use the army to squash them. Coz the Rusyns did not want Hungarian masters anymore.

&gt;""Hungarians would never allow them"", jesus can you possibly be more bigoted

5658,"The problem with your argumentation in your reply is basing it off two things:

\- territorial gains

\- minority rights

First things first, minority rights:

I think you misinterpreted the ""autonomy"" part, i meant that generally not specifically. it was not targeting slovakia in general. Hungarian minority in southern slovakia not caring is a half-truth, most of them accepted their fate of never being part of hungary again, and i have to say probably they are right. There wont be border changes unless war, which obviously is not a right direction, but i think its important to defend ideas especially when someone is deliberately trying to smear them/OR to engage in conversation like we do

With your ""we want territory"" argument, the problem is we dont want territory, we want our people back. And you using territory over and over again shows that you really dont want to lose lands, the funny thing is, this is really smiliair to the sentiment of 19th century hungary but reversed: we cant let the slovakians go, even tho they are a majority in the north because heavens forbid we LOSE TERRITORY. (today: We cant let the hungarians go because heavens forbid we LOSE TERRITORY). You are disputing the very principles of your country's foundation while simultaneously commiting aganist it.

(Altough i have to agree, that the majority of very loud revisionist want land and doesent really care about the people there. Trust me, i cant stand those people too)

The borders that are setup now, HAD tension and power-struggle built in them by the french and english to keep a grip on central europe during the WW's, that time is long gone and ( i think ) to properly transfer to the 21st century we should abolish and renew these old-world artifacts, we should find a middle ground where its good for everyone so scars from that time could finally heal. But ignorance is dangerious, because it can only make those wounds opener.

(Trianon was unjust and it had a huge impact on our culture and general sentiment, as you know hungarys pessimistic ideal has greatly affected its political place in the world.) 

&amp;#x200B;

As for the political side, i agree: Our putinist government is really a piece of shit, and i really really hope no revision happens during their reign, because that would legitimitize them even more.

5741,"&gt; Although world leaders condemned the Romanian people for the execution of the Ceausescus without ""proper trials"" (please...)

Democracies are not justified and defended by their ends. There's a very good reason for that: Without cutting corners, the act of having a trial as fair as can be, lasting years if necessary would have imparted a culture and common trust among the state and the people to uphold the same principle in high regard and penalize those who didn't in the future. Additionally an expansive, more formal process will gain more legitimacy by investigating the events in a deeper and broader fashion and eradicate more of the damaging influence (the administration wasn't solely made up of the couple for example), improving the prospects of the Romanian people's collective future.

The simpler example is: It's not just that your party did or got something, it's that you gave the government legitimacy by voting at all. Form, formality matters.

&gt; It's sad that the current leaders of Romania still believe that corruption is an acceptable way to rule.

That corruption can linger because the easy, quick and vengeful form of dealing with the old regime was preferred. Without events like the alternative trial described above, a society can't escape the 19th century mentality of a zero-sum game (even within itself) and overcome its mutual distrust to establish a common trust which enables it to function in a respectful, cohesive, orderly manner. 

Finland is a country that has walked this line very finely and can be used to describe the pitfalls to avoid. You should be more careful when encouraging rash acts like these. There's usually much more to left on the table.

Four days before Christmas Eve 2015, Dick Jansen from Burgum got the idea to burn a light on the war graves in his hometown, just as it had been for 25 years at the Canadian cemetery in Holten. His second thought was why can not that happen all over the Netherlands? He put a Facebook action on the Facebook page of the mobile museum of old army vehicles Keep Them Rolling, with the idea that if 15 to 20 people also do this is nice. But that was different ... the action on the social media was massively picked up and shared by many people.

The response was unbelievable, and on Christmas Eve 2015 there were candles at war cemeteries in more than 140 places in the Netherlands. In 2016, light was placed at 263 locations in the Netherlands. In 2017 more than 284 locations burn a light at a war grave. And not only in the Netherlands but also outside. Hundreds of people are busy to burn a light on Christmas Eve. People's clubs have already emerged to make this a regular tradition.

5875,"Brest-litovsk was the fucking failed abortion of a brainchild from the german general staff at the time. The idea was that by imposing an incredibly harsh treaty on Russia the allies would for some reason seek peace to avoid similar terms. In reality it only convinced them that Germany was at fault in the war, that the original justification in defending austria-hungary was bullshit, and that they wanted to undergo some kind of imperialistic expansion which would entail annexing swaths of european territory. It only hardened their resolve against what could now undeniably be called german expansionism, and killed any chance for Germany to claim they weren't the aggressors after the war.

It was definitely one of the stupidest things they did throughout the entire war; if they'd gone with a less harsh treaty, maybe just getting reparations and *food* in the form of ukrainian grain or something for their starving population, the allies might have been more sympathetic and willing to call the whole war a mistake on everyone's part. But no, the Generals held such influence over affairs of state during this kind of total war that they could satisfy their lebensraum boners all they wanted, and could totally disregard both the purpose and bigger picture of the war for germany, actually indirectly dooming their country to fascism by encouraging the harshness of the Versailles treaty a few months later. It's because of stuff like this that the first world war is called the Seminal Tragedy; it's so, so pointless and avoidable in retrospect but has such grave consequences.",,/r/europe/comments/a97t35/proposed_czech_corridor_1919/ecie1og/,zeszs,1545727392

5898,"&gt;Boy, you got all your corners covered. With falsified census that saw hungarian population skyrocketing by 500 percent in mere 30 years.

??? Not a single census shows Slovakians over 15% in the city from 1850 (the first one), until 1920.

&gt;The population in Hungary suddenly skyrocketing by 50 percent of entire population in mere 3 decades. What a natality! And yet the kingdom itself did not see it on total demography, how puzzling indeed.

??? In 1880 the percentage was 46,7%, in 1910 it was 54,4%. What's so unnatural about it, considering how Slovaks and Romanians disproportionately migrated to the United States during this time?

&gt;Teacher who do not want to raise their pupils as proper Magyars, I will prohibit to teach. For every citizen of the state applies principle that the master is Magyar

&gt;Count Albert Apponyi, Minister of Education, writer of Lex Apponyi of that non-existant magyarization that disbanded slovak high schools, confiscated all properties of Matica Slovenska, the main and only printer of slovak-language magazines and publications, that handed over the complete control over scholarship to FEMKE. While here there is such a massive oppression that there is 100 percent state funded hungarian-language university, that states completely bankrolls by law minority schools in towns with 20 percent majority where language of minority is tauchg as primary one, slovak as secondary, where there are multiple hungarian-language only news medias in south, TVs, radios.

Do you want me to quote Benes too? Do you want me to mention how Hungarians were forced to do hard labour to pressure us to accept the czechoslovaks to deport the Hungarians? Do you want to talk about how many schools, publications, universities and hungarian language magazines were confesticated after the war?

Do you think that's slovakization too or that's different?

&gt;disbanded slovak high schools

No such thing happened, if it did it's not because they were slovak.

&gt;confiscated all properties of Matica Slovenska

I'm sure if a Hungarian newspaper in Slovakia advocated the Hungarians to rise up against the state it wouldn't meet the same fate in a heartbeat. Oh wait

&gt;that handed over the complete control over scholarship to FEMKE

And now scholarship of Hungarian depend on the same slovakian regulatory body.

&gt;While here there is such a massive oppression that there is 100 percent state funded hungarian-language university, that states completely bankrolls by law minority schools in towns with 20 percent majority where language of minority is tauchg as primary one

Certainly noone was or is happy about it. But you know what? It is precisely because we experienced ethnic cleansing in such vast numbers that we know how much suffering entails and what it would mean to try and change anything about how matters are today.

I have a good Polish friend and have travelled those formerly German lands and cities extensively with her. For all their German history and obvious influence they are Polish cities today. If one forcibly removed all Poles and put Germans back, what meaning would those cities have to those Germans today? None. Even if you only put back descendants of the expelled (now scattered all over Germany), they would not be a community, they would be strangers among strangers in a strange land. And those Poles would lose their homes just like members of my family did 70 years ago.

What we lost then is more than ‚Äöclay‚Äò. We lost intangible things like dialects, folk tales, customs and local legends, things intimately connected to the people that were expelled. Nothing and noone will bring those back now. Reading a book about Silesian-German folk tales will do more to preserve that cultural history than whining ‚ÄöGibe back clay‚Äò in an online forum.
