Uhhhh..


There is already a simmering war in Ukraine and it's not out of the realms of possibility that at some point in the future Russia could try and stir up some trouble in the Baltics amongst it's sizeable Russian minorities there.

Then look towards the Balkans. Kosovo remains pretty much a frozen conflict and if not that then Bosnia is a plastered over conflict that could foreseeably crack open again.


And even at a stretch, crazier things have happened than the possibility of tensions reigniting between Greece/Turkey over Cyprus at some point.

Fun fact: It is unwritten law that the Bundespräsident (currently Frank-Walter Steinmeier), as the head of state, is allowed to change state symbols if he wants to (excluding unlawful ones and those not complying to the Grundgesetz - which means he can't change the flag for example).

Kind of like ""my lady"")  despre lucrul turcilor, cum am auzit eu că împăratul a ieșit din Sofia și alminteri nu e. Și s-a dus în sus pe Dunăre.

(I pak) să știi dumneata că a venit un om de la Nicopole de mi-a spus (mie) că a văzut cu ochii lui că au trecut acele corăbii de care știi și dumneata pe Dunăre în sus.

(I pak) să știi că bagă din toate orașele câte 50 de oameni să fie de ajutor în corăbii.

(I pak) să știi că s-au prins (the idiom is still used, but in casual speech; modern Romanians would probably say ""au descoperit"") niște meșteri din Istambul cum vor trece acele corabii prin locul cel strâmt de care știi și dumneata.

(I pak) spun dumitale despre lucrul lui Mahamet-Beg, cum am auzit de la boieri ce sunt vecini și de la ginere-meu Negre, cum i-a dat împăratul libertate lui Mahamet-Beg, să treacă după cum îi va fi voia prin Țara Românească.

(I pak) să știi dumneata că are frică mare și Băsărab de acel hoț de Mahamet-Beg, mai mult decât domniile voastre.
 
(I pak) îți spun dumitale, ca mai-marele meu, despre ce am înțeles și eu. Eu îți spun dumitale, iar dumneata ești înțelept și aceste cuvinte să le ții dumneata la tine, să nu știe (somewhat archaic; ""să nu afle"" would probably be used today) mulți oameni, și domniile voastre să vă păziți cum știți mai bine.

If you understand Spanish, you can read about the alternative names of the Crown of Aragon on the [Spanish Wikipedia page](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona_de_Arag%C3%B3n#Nombres_alternativos). There you can see the different names that were used. Today we use ""Crown of Aragon"", which is applied in the current historiography, but at the time of the Crown it didn't exist first, and wasn't the most used later. It was centuries after the founding of the Crown of Aragon when this term was used predominantly.

Because there are people who get confused with the name, I thought that with the alternative name ""Corona Aragonum et Catalonie"", which existed at the time of the Crown, you would find it easier to understand.

For more information, I leave you the definition of Crown of Aragon that you can find in the [Aragonese encyclopedia](http://www.enciclopedia-aragonesa.com/voz.asp?voz_id=4285): ""Political form resulting from the coordination of the Kingdom of Aragon and the Principality of Catalonia.""

&gt;But to answer, no social protection and technology. Every country can put up their own rules. We only need some rules on temporarily visiting workers, which gives authority to different government depending on the case. 

So out with Bolkenstein. I am in, several countries currently saying ""stop Brussels"" are for though, like Poland.


&gt;Remove all EU programmes on culture etc. Instead we simply give poorer countries a sum of money they can use. 

What is underway basically, but can you be more specific regarding those programmes?


&gt;We need less protectionism inside EU, meaning dropping agricultural aid and other trade barriers. We can implement subsidies when domestic production drop lower than X% due to national security reasons. 

What trade barrier inside the EU? Do you know a few left?


&gt;Keep free movement in EU which favours workers. Restricting capital is only possible in heavily authoritarian societies. It is only fair to give the workers the same bargaining power as capital. Let people decide on their own migration policies otherwise. 


Freedom of workers but yoy want to drop Bolkenstein? Fine. But is also one of the stuff that drove UK oustide.

&gt;Let people decide on their own migration policies otherwise.

Like right know in fact. Unless you mean dropping Shengen.

Culture is a social construct and as such its constantly changing and evolving. It isn't some set in stone thing that people either have or don't have.

300,"Castile and [Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Catalonia) were also two independent countries. 

Catalonia was part of the [Crown of Aragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_of_Aragon) as much as Aragon was part of the Crown of Aragon. Aragon was not above Catalonia, nor Catalonia above Aragon. The Crown of Aragon was a voluntary union between Catalans and Aragonese, that functioned as a confederation; which means each member state (like Catalonia) enjoyed a large degree of independence. Within the Crown of Aragon there were 3 major states: Principality of Catalonia, Kingdom of Aragon and Kingdom of Valencia.

And, in any case, Catalonia has also had periods of full independence in its history. The history of Catalonia does not start in the Crown of Aragon or end there. You have examples in the [Catalan Republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_Republic).

Aragon, Catalonia and Valencia were absorbed by Castile, abolishing their own institutions, parliaments and languages, by unilateral decision of the King of Spain. The Castilian law and institutions were imposed on them. All this happened with the [Nueva Planta decrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nueva_Planta_decrees), by right of conquest after losing the war. It was not a voluntary union, but an absorption. 

And the fact that they were absorbed by Castile by right of conquest, not by voluntary decision, is still recognized by the Aragonese, Catalan and Valencian governments nowadays. So, if Scotland has the right to independence, the same or more right have Catalonia, Aragon or Valencia.

&gt; Catalan governments are experts in violence too:

All governments in the world use police violence when necessary. That's why the police exist. What no civilized country in the world does is send the police to beat the peaceful people who are voting. Dictators do it, but not countries that are called democratic.

https://estaticos.elperiodico.com/resources/jpg/6/7/1500632828676.jpg

And we even had some of them post-155 where the 'no' to independence was winning. Of course these CEO can be tricked pretty easily, usually by messing with the primary Catalan speakers ratios to get the desired results. 

&gt;Every time our leaders get jailed with bogus charges

Repeating this won't make it true. Embezzlement and Prevarication are a given, the others just depend on how much do you believe your leaders to be cowardly and incompetent or if you actually believe them to be brave and in control of the situation wanting to take this to last consequences. 

&gt;people get beaten up

Yeah, the 1-O was a big fuck up. The rest of the police charges since then has been on the Catalan government, though. Although since this is Mas' movement, it's easy to forget who were the ones responsible for Plaça de Catalunya.

&gt;our autonomy gets abolished

Except that didn't happened. 

&gt;The ""more autonomy"" thing would've worked back in 2012 with the fiscal pact, not now. It's too late to do anything less than a referendum.

Maybe for you. That's certainly not a thing for a lot of people.

&gt;Rachel Anne Doležal (born November 12, 1977), also known as Nkechi Amare Diallo, is an American former civil rights activist known for claiming to be a black woman while being of white-European ancestry and having no known black or African ancestry. Doležal was president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) chapter in Spokane, Washington from 2014 until June 2015, when she resigned after the NAACP confronted her about her ethnicity claims, believing them to be false. She received further public scrutiny when her white parents publicly stated that Doležal was a white woman passing as black.

A German example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martina_Big

&gt; In mid-January 2017 Martina had a medical treatment that changed her appearance from Caucasian to a black woman.

&gt;In late March 2018, Martina announced that she had undergone a baptism ceremony in Nyeri, Kenya and had consequently taken the new name Malaika Kubwa which means ""big angel"" in the Swahili language.

408,"&gt; It's a semi-vowel. And it's pronounced like a short vowel.

It's perceived as a short vowel and it's more convenient to call it a semi-vowel, but that doesn't mean it actually is one.

&gt; There is absolutely no difference between bani and oi. It's the same i. Where's the consonant in oi that is to be palatised? There aren't any.

The ""i"" in ""oi"" is a [palatal approximant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatal_approximant), a.k.a. ""yod"". It's not the same thing. You perceive them as identical because they are used in the same context to form plurals, the yod after vowels and palatalization after consonants, but that's just a matter of perception and not reality.

460,"With Russia/Ukraine, you are forgetting on whose territory the conflict is happening, so that’s not an internal situation, like in Yugoslavia. I have an unpopular here view on Crimea (which makes some call me pro-Russian) as while procedurs where broken, the majority of the people do clearly want to live in Russia and the territory was more Russian than Ukrainian through history, but backing of the rebels in Donetsk and Lugansk is a different story. Those once relatively rich cities are now in limbo and the population fled (judging by traffic jams to bery few cars on Donetsk streets, a vast majority of the population) and that was a bad idea. But also, for me there is another thing influencing the West’s support for Ukraine. Moldova aside (which is small and can be merged into Romania when a crisis hits), Ukraine is the closest to being a failed state in Europe. While Russia’s GDP per capita is practically as high as say Polands and Belarus’s is also quite nice, Ukraine, a very big country by European standards is still closer to Moldova and the GDP seems to not be growing and the population emigrating as fast as they can. And a failed state that size in Europe would be a catastrofy, so no wonder the West would rather see it saved. And taking away Donetsk and it’s rich mineral full region is not helping. I mean I’m sure that (alternstive future history musings time) if the state fell, Russia would be all to glad to take Kharkov or Odessa and the Russian speaking population would be OK with that (if not initially than in the later years), but the vast majority of the country, Lviv to Kiev sees no other future than a free Ukrainian state and nobody else would like to govern a hostile population.

It has two national anthems. 
""Der er et yndigt Land"" is most known internationally by sports fans, as this is the one played most often since the 1980's
""Kong Christian stod ved højen mast"" is the ""official"" anthem used when there is royalty or state business involved.

The first song is most definitely about the land. It is one long praise to the history and beauty of the land and its people. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3chUVA1rZRY And no it is not a mistake that the band stops playing. Danes expect it and treasury the ability to scream as loud as they can at these events. The USA tradition of one strong vocalist showing talent is the complete opposite in Denmark where it is all about joining in and participating regardless of any actual vocal beauty.

The second one is about King Christian IV (1577-1648) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyCMcF-1SR4 and this is a very different type of tune praising the strength of the leader and army to protect the citizens.

567,"&gt;No diacriticized letters―they’re replaced with more distinct characters, 

So instead of using diacritics to fit the language better like every normal language does, you want to use a totally different script with added letters that will make the language even harder to understand.

If we want to simplify we can just remove the ă diacritic, like the english does. For example a is used in ""**a** car"" instead of the equivalent diacritic of ""**ă** car"" in romanian.

&gt;and there are letters that stand for common clusters so that makes things shorter.

They exist in romanian already, they are called diacritics. For example english uses a combinations of letter to represent 2 different diacritics from romanian language:

**zz** in pi**zz**a is used instead of **ț** in romanian. They are the same sound.

**sh** is used, like in ""**sh**ow"" instead of romanian **ș**. They are the same sound.

&gt;And apart from a legal perspective, you must also understand that few people in the West (or generally in Europe) can understand what Serbs are thinking. I mean after the peaceful fall of communism, the mostly peaceful falling apart of the USSR, the continent got to see two bloody wars in 1990s Europe. That was something not easily forgotten. I was young back than, but I remember the TV news with fights on streets that looked just like home, while we were used to seeing such pictures from say Africa. And Serbia as the main republic and the continuator of Yugoslavia has to pay the price. Especially as just a few years earlier, apart from some brutal incidents in the Baltics and some unrest in Moscow and elesewhere, the dreaded Soviet Union really did fall quite peacefully. And it was not the Red Army which did a barbaric siege of say Minsk or Kiev in the 90s, but the Serb Army which broke all rules in Sarajevo. So let at least a generation pass before you want the world to see stuff your way...

Oh, I know. We picked the wrong side and simply paid the price. The wheel of history keeps turning, sometimes you win, like in WWI, sometimes you lose, like the 90s.

It had a terrible outcome for the infrastructure where many railways were never completed. By 1870, there were 4 banks in entire territory that had a Czech capital. Zivnobanka was one of the founded in 1868. The majority Czech and Moravian population and businesses had no access to capital till 1860’s. Usury was common and poverty was terrible. On average 15 thousand Czechs arrived yearly to USA alone until 1914. The recession from 1873-1879 and the non participation decimated the Czech economic and political climate. Economic stagnation lasted till 1892. Martial laws were common and invoked every generation. The only time Czechs prospered were years between 1892-1913. Damn 20 years and at the end Germans wanted to reverse all the social, cultural, and economic gains the Czechs had achieved. In 1913 the land government was dissolved. Czechs were facing the Slovak fate. The Archbishops of Prague and Olomouc were Germans so was a bishop of Brno during WW1. Who was the majority of Catholics there?

He did stupid things like placing his brother on the Spanish throne creating the ""Spanish Ulcer"" which drained his armies of almost all of their reinforcements. He didn't create the Kingdom of Poland even though that would have reinforced him with about 200000 troops and paralyzed the movement of the Russian armies. He didn't wage total war on the Russians by declaring all serfs free when Russia was waging a total war on him. 

In many respects Napoleon was very close to victory. The continental system most likely would have worked if Portugal had been closed to British commerce. Instead of devoting his attention to Spain and portugal however he focused his attention on Russia with famously catastrophic results.

879,"&gt; Looking at just one country, I could accept your explanation. However, this is a blight that affected each and every country under Soviet influence, while all the rest of western Europe prospered ... It is not just direct rule from Russia, but rule through the communist system developed by Russia and the soviet economy.

First of all, it wasn't the entire Western Europe that prospered during the cold war. Yes, Germany, France, UK, Benelux and Scandinavia did prosper, but these were already advanced countries well before WW2. Sure, WW2 did a lot of damage to their economy, and the Marshall plan helped a lot, but the Marshall plan would have been completely useless if they did not have a well educated population and professional people in the government. Most countries in Eastern Europe never had that. Again, even if Romania did become aligned with the West during the cold war and received money under the Marshall Plan, most of that money would have gone in the pockets of politicians and their friends, as it happens today with money from the EU.

&gt;That is why I mention the eastern part of Germany, which has the same culture and language as the western part and yet did very badly during Soviet times. Their society was so damaged by Russian influence, that even today, that are the region where German fascism thrives, while the rest of Germany looks in shock.

Comparing East Germany to West Germany is absurd. Ignoring the fact that market economies are superior to centrally planned economies, there are a variety of other factors that contributed to East Germany being poorer than the West:

1. While West Germany received enormous sums of money from the US to rebuild its economy, East Germany not only didn't receive shit from the Soviets, they actually paid the Soviets huge amounts of money as war reparations and occupation costs. How do you expect a country to develop when you destroy their infrastructure, impose an inefficient economic system and make them pay huge amounts of money before they even have a chance to rebuild anything? 

2. Before the construction of the Berlin wall, millions of people left East Germany for the West. And it wasn't the old people who left, it was the workforce. In fact, this is the main reason the wall was built in the first place, if they didn't build it, East Germany would have become a ghost country within a couple of decades. 

Yet, even with this very unfavourable situation, of being completely destroyed and constantly sucked dry by the Soviets, East Germany still managed to be the most prosperous and stable communist country ever. It had a higher standard of living than probably all other Eastern bloc countries, including the Soviet Union itself. Yugoslavia was maybe more developed than East Germany, but Yugoslavia was only partially communist. 

Also, the difference in the standard of living between East Germany and West Germany was not as big as most people think. The GDP per capita of East Germany was roughly half of that of West Germany, which, while it is a big difference, it's still smaller than the difference between Romania and Germany **today**.

952,"Theresa May’s secret plan to secure a Brexit deal and win the backing of parliament can be revealed today.

Senior sources say the prime minister has secured private concessions from Brussels that will allow her to keep the whole of Britain in a customs union, avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. They expect this to placate remainer Tories and win over some Labour MPs.

And in a move that will appeal to Eurosceptics, May is also said to be on course to secure a political deal on a “future economic partnership” (FEP) with the European Union that will allow Britain to keep open the prospect of a free trade deal resembling that enjoyed by Canada.

The Sunday Times has been told that preparations for a final deal are far more advanced than previously disclosed and will lead to a document of 50 pages or more when it is published — not the vague, five-page plan many expect.

Cabinet sources say parts of it “could have been written by Jacob Rees-Mogg”, the leader of the hardline Eurosceptics.

A close aide of Michel Barnier, the EU negotiator, revealed a major concession on the Irish border during a private meeting in London last week. The EU now accepts that regulatory checks on goods can take place “in the market” by British officials, meaning they can be conducted at factories and shops rather than at the border.

Downing Street officials are desperate to see enough progress this week for the EU to announce a special summit later in November to agree the final details. May will discuss the proposals with her cabinet on Tuesday. Under the plans:

● The EU will write an all-UK customs deal into the legally binding withdrawal agreement so an EU-designed “backstop” treating Northern Ireland differently from the UK mainland is not required

● There will be an “exit clause” to convince Eurosceptics the UK will not be in it for ever

● The FEP will outline how a new trade deal would balance market access and border checks, making clear that a deal along the lines of the EU’s arrangement with Canada is still a possible outcome as is May’s Chequers plan for close alignment.

May will sell the plan by:

● Telling Brexiteer ministers that unless they support it, they will be personally responsible for causing a no-deal Brexit, which most regard as a potential disaster

● Telling remainers that May fought for the closest possible alignment until the last minute, but that the negotiations mean Britain will not be a full member of the customs union for ever

● Not admitting in public that she has ditched her Chequers blueprint, but signalling privately that she will allow a “pivot” towards a different “landing zone” for the final deal.

The Sunday Times has pieced together the plan after speaking to a dozen ministers, advisers, civil servants and EU officials.

The challenge May faces in winning support for the plan is spelt out in stark terms today by David Davis, the former Brexit secretary. Writing for The Sunday Times, he issues a call for the prime minister to publish legal advice on any deal so ministers and MPs understand its implications before they are asked to vote on it.

Davis warns May that she will get in the same “mess” as Tony Blair did over the Iraq War unless she is transparent about the legal basis for “one of the most fundamental decisions that a government will have taken in modern times”.

He writes that Blair’s reputation “never recovered” after he refused to publish the legal advice of his attorney-general, Lord Goldsmith, on Iraq. When it leaked during the 2005 general election campaign it revealed Goldsmith’s doubts about the legality of war.

“It’s now time to publish the legal advice the cabinet has received — no ifs and no buts,” Davis writes. “Blair suffered because he wriggled and prevaricated. I would urge the prime minister to do the right thing and publish the advice; if she won’t, the cabinet should exert its collective authority to compel her to do so.

“We need the cards laid on the table so that we can form a judgment. Is the future of the union at stake? Are we being hurtled towards a Hotel California Brexit where we can check out, but we can never leave?”

Nine cabinet ministers have already told May they cannot sign up to a deal until the attorney-general, Geoffrey Cox, has given it his backing. If May does not give way, Tory backbenchers plan to use a “humble address” to demand the legal papers from the government ahead of a Commons vote on a deal. The same ploy was used earlier this year to force Davis to publish sectoral Brexit impact assessment documents.

May’s customs plan will put the Labour front bench in a difficult position because the party has called for Britain to stay in the customs union.

Dominic Raab, Davis’s successor, is understood to be bullish about the prospects of getting a deal that will satisfy Eurosceptics. But Brexiteer cabinet ministers fear they will be bounced into backing May’s scheme without proper scrutiny. They worry that the exit clause from the customs union might contain a provision keeping Northern Ireland in closer alignment with Brussels if the rest of the UK left — which would attract the ire of May’s Democratic Unionist Party backers and make it likely that Britain would in effect never leave.

In those circumstances, the political declaration would be meaningless. One cabinet source said: “Effectively, the FEP will be written in disappearing ink, and on March 30 next year it will be a blank sheet of paper.”

Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister, said ministers should make the decision. “It is vital that the cabinet is ultimately in charge of the government’s position with the prime minister and is seen to be engaged in the decisions and is a profound challenge to our constitutional system. We’ve got enough difficulties without challenging the principle of cabinet governance.”

A No 10 spokesman said: “This is all speculation. The prime minister has been clear that we are making good progress on the future relationship and 95% of the withdrawal agreement is now settled. Negotiations are ongoing.”

A senior Whitehall source added: “The PM will be able to say there’s no more backstop, we’ve got rid of that — success. It is UK-wide — success. There’s an exit mechanism — success. And you’ve got Canada. The small print is that Ireland is f*****.”

And so I let you know of the deeds of the Turks, as I have heard that the emperor [that is, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent] has left Sofia, and that must be true, and went up the Danube.

And so you should know that a man from Nicopolis came to me and told me they saw with their own eyes that those ships which you know about have sailed up the Danube.

And so you should know that they are taking 50 men from each town to help on the ships.

And so you should know that some experts from Tsarigrad [that is, Istanbul] realized how to make the ships to move past that tight place which you know too.

And so I tell you about the deed of Mahamet beg, as I heard from neighbouring boyars and from my son-in-law Negre, that the emperor gave Mahamet Beg freedom to pass through Wallachia [Țeara Rumânească, lit. ""the Romanian land"", this being also the first mention of the name ""Romania"" in a Romanian text] wherever he pleases.

And so you should know that our Basarab too is fearful of that thief Mahamet beg, even more so than you.

We are talking about Germany here, the country that _definitely_ has tried to clear up its past and be honest about it. Lots of Germans don't like Nazis, lots of Germans resent anti-semitism and racism. 

The rise of AfD, remarkably similar to that of the NSDAP, even _without an economic crisis_ (that's damn important) has frightened many Germans now. We're watching CDU/CSU and FDP openly siding wtih those neo-Nazis (think of what Seehofer and Maaßen did), but only SPD denouncing them with words, not actions. SPD simply is losing public trust in standing up for democracy. Die Linke is just batshit insane in some parts, authoritarian and anti-immigration too (thanks, Wagenknecht).

The Greens however did not change their position on immigration or right wing extremism _in any way_. Stoically they continued following their beliefs in that matter, even when they abandoned their economical beliefs quiet strongly.

SPD is losing as the junior partner in a coalition, that's the usual curse. But Greens aren't just winning from that - they are winning because they did not sell out their core belief.",,/r/europe/comments/9tvzsp/greens_reach_new_high_in_german_election_polling/e90scgs/,Bier-throwaway,1541316142

In particular Old, Middle, and Early-Modern English were in essence written how they were spoken and written down phonemically.

At some point English spelling became frozen in no small part due to the influenced of the KJV which basically standardized English spelling to some degree; spelling was absolutely not standardized at the time of the KJV and not only did everyone write in their own dialect but they also invented completely different ways to spell it.

So this obscures the sound changes that came after the KJV—make no mistake that when the KJV was written it was essentially pronounced how it was written with no silent letters or anything like that.

1324,"I paste my comment from other thread:

Current Polish governement is trying to do something about it. The possibilites of this going to happen are very low. First of all in the light of interantional law Poland renounced all claims in 1953. The fact that Poland was not independent country, and the decision was forced on rulers of Poland by Soviets (yes, Polish communists were opposing) does not matter.

So yes, there is no legal responsiblity, but there is a moral one.

In an effect of joint German-Soviet attack Poland was occupied and destroyed for six years. After that Poland lost eastern territories and in exchange of this gained from Soviet Union former German territories east of Oder-Nisa line. Polish legal governement was disallowed and puppet communist regime was installed in Warsaw.

Poland had a right to 15% of reparations paid by Germany to SU. How much of this sum actually Poland received? Hard to say, but because Poland was an object of predatory economy, and was forced to sell i.e. coal below the cost of production to Russia, we can assume that Poland gained almost nothing.

In later years, under mutual German-Polish agreements Polish people who were forced labourers in Germany received compensations. It was 1.3 billion DM in 1970s. And about 1 billion of Euro after 2001. But the sums were rather symbollical (for example 1 billion distributed by Foundation of Polish-German Reconciliation was received by 500 thousands of people, so about 2000 euro per person).

These sums are nothing in comparison with destruction of Poland.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/9tzffb/merkel_visits_poland_amid_calls_for_world_war_ii/e90gn9m/,iwanttosaysmth,1541300122

My best guess is that it was there to signal the gemination of the previous consonant in good old medieval orthography style. (Meaning: random orthography.)

The word itself though:

* Root: tud (from the same Proto-Uralic root *tumte- (“to know”) as Finnish tuntea and Estonian tundma)

* -othlon -&gt; ""-atlan"" in contemporary Hungarian. ""-tlan/-tlen"" is the privative suffix, meaning ""without"". The o before is a linking vowel.

____________________________________

The SPD has been in of the government as part of the grand coalition together with the CDU/CSU under Merkel between 2005-2009 and from 2013-now. Plus before that from 1998-2005 they actually were the leading party in the government. So it's pretty save to say they always were in a position of influence in recent times and very much share the responsibility of the current state of affairs. 

Overall i'd say Germany is currently doing quite decently (especially compared to some other nations) with a solid economy, low unemployment rates and (compared to e.g. say the US) a decent social security system. That said especially because imo there is a chance to now tackle a lot of issues, there are plenty of problems that need fixing now. For example: Affordable rents and housing, inequalities in the wealth distribution, fixes for the health and pension systems (especially important for future generations), or fighting the climate change. So some change is definitely needed and i think a lot of people agree on that, whether they are moderate or have more radical opinions like the AfD.

______________________________________ 

Now to how the SPD lost a lot of support:

You might have noticed the hype around their chancellor candidate Martin Schulz before the last federal election last year (also here on reddit). Before he ran for chancellor he was part of the European parliament and actually it's president (from 2012-2017). So he didn't really have any luggage from internal politics (not sure if that is the right expression) and came from a job at the EU, which the vast majority of Germans has a positive stance towards. Really imo the perfect position for a fresh start. And this showed in polls, with the SPD having fantastic results in the beginning. 

And then the Schulz hype train derailed...hard. They basically never delivered a big plan coming towards the 2017 election. Instead of giving a program of how to tackle big issues they offered no solutions (or at least a vision) and almost exclusively seemed to focus on the migrant crisis and foreign politics in TV debates (no doubt important, but vastly over-represented and over-discussed).

Well the election results were obviously bad. They actually went into the whole thing saying that under no circumstances they'd do another grand coalition. But after talks for forming the government between the CDU/CSU, greens and FDP failed, they did a 180° turn on that promise.

At least subjectively to me it seemed like basically the whole SPD party leadership just tried to get into comfortable government positions, including Martin Schulz who tried to become minister for foreign affairs. This obviously didn't go down well, so Schulz was dropped like a hot potato. With everyone else settling into their cosy jobs without much change.And it overall can be seen a huge betrayal of trust.

In any case after a long period without new government after the election, we got another grand coalition. With the imo most noticeable new change that the CSU (extremely conservative bavarian party) and prominently their leader Horst Seehofer (now minister of the interior) having a much larger say in federal affairs. Which is arguably not a good thing in the opinion of a large share of the german population. So far nothing really positive has imo come out of the current iteration of the grand coalition and since the elections there have been plenty of new issues and controversies.

A relatively recent and imo pretty damning example is the whole Chemnitz controversy about Hans-Georg Maaßen, former President of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution. See e.g. [his wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Georg_Maa%C3%9Fen) with a summary about this topic. Imo it should be noted that the SPD threatened to break the coalition during the whole thing, and yet the try to basically give him a promotion happened with acceptance of Andrea Nahles (current leader of the SPD).

The german one is much more extensive and includes other controversies regarding topics like the NSA/Snowden affair, him (when he was a Federal Attorney General) basically trying to charge a journalistic online portal with treason, or him giving the right wing party AfD advice on how to not get put under surveillance from his own agency. 

__________________________________________

And with this you are basically caught up to speed with the current state of affairs. With the loss in voter trust showing for example in the most recent state elections in Bavaria (CSU always having a majority but SPD being the second party, but now actually only at 9% and only 5th party overall) and Hessen. Both time dropping over 10% in the votes.

The greens are really profiting from this, since they are more or less the next closes party on the political spectrum from the SPD. And for many CDU/CSU voters it is actually the next best choice as well, if you want to change party, but not move to the extremely right AfD.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/9tvzsp/greens_reach_new_high_in_german_election_polling/e90hwpx/,golli123,1541301370

Awaiting his court trial, he was being held in solitary confinement.[4] The court trial ended on 31 October 2014 and he was found guilty by the jury and sentenced to three and a half years in prison.

1461,"&gt;Nuclear power is a controversial issue, I can understand their skepticism, it is not renewable and does cause horrific toxic waste that damages the environment, the greens have in recent times been more open to nuclear energy but will always and rightly so advocate for renewable energy and tech.

Nuclear power is far better than fossil fuel -  *especially if you already have the powerplants*. That is why many Green party members in Germany want to stop the phasing out of Nuclear.

On the other hand - new nuclear power is very expensive. And what's worse - it's a massive upfront investment that will first pay of decades after completion. While wind, sun and storage may have become 20-30% cheaper and more effective in 15 years, you are still not seeing a return on your nuclear powerplant.

Having said that - new smaller modular nuclear power plants, where you basically rethink the technology, should be supported. There are many interesting start-ups focused on molting salt reactors and waste burners. Some of them are no bigger than a small bus and very versatile. And they can potentially be used as nuclear waste management since they can make energy while the waste transition to isotopes with very short halflife.",Scandinavia,/r/europe/comments/9tvzsp/greens_reach_new_high_in_german_election_polling/e909frh/,litritium,1541293227

They will also obviously disagree with Trump about global climate protection policies.

Your society is on a knife edge. A soldier is not a policeman. A soldier is a blunt instrument. A soldier is what you reach for when you have exhausted *every* other option and are out of ideas. A soldier is trained to kill enemies of the state. Anywhere a soldier is deployed, is (in a soldier's mind) enemy territory.

Maltese was the pauper's language and the earliest instances of maltese being written was by the knights of st.John trying to study the weird language the people used while only knowing european languages or very limited arabic. (one of the oldest maltese dictionaries I've seen actually has a mixture of latin and arabic letters, with arabic letters being the ones that have no comparison to those in Latin.)

Grammatically maltese is essentially simplified arabic (e.g. we have the conjugation to describe a pair of objects specifically but not that to talk to two people). It is very difficult to learn if you have no background in arabic.

We actually have more italian and Sicilian words in our vocabulary than Semitic words but all of the function words are semitic (e.g. most verbs). The Italian words are mostly related to crafts, religion and government since we had very close ties to sicily. However a lot of words related to technology are loan words from English even if we already had a word for it (e.g. mitjar -&gt; ajruport).

''Green party Natalie Bennett has said, because people should not be punished for what they think.'' “it should not be a crime simply to belong to an organisation or have sympathy with its aims, though it should be a crime to aid and abet criminal acts or deliberately fund such acts”. These sound a little bit different from the picture you are trying to paint. I disagree with her completely, but then again that is because I don't give a shit about free speech and think this is grounds for the suspension of rights, but her logic is consistent and has nothing to do with being sympathetic to ISIS or Al-Qaeda. 

&gt; Caroline Lucas signed an early day motion in defence of homeopathy.
 
''In July 2010, Dr Lucas initially signed Early Day Motion 284: BMA Annual Representative Meeting Motions on Homeopathy which expressed concern at a number of motions to be put forward at the British Medical Association's annual representative meeting calling ""for no further commissioning of, nor funding for, homeopathic remedies in the NHS"", and ""thinks that an integrated NHS, which employs the best from the orthodox and complementary ... could deliver better and more cost-effective outcomes at a time of financial prudence"".'' To add to this:

''However, she later withdrew her signature from the motion''. So your second point is a blatant lie it seems. 

&gt; They want to move to a zero growth economy.

Your third point is again somewhat misleading. They argue that they want a fundamental restructuring of the economy that is centred not on progress for the sake of progress in terms of economic growth under capitalism. Instead they are focusing on: ecological sustainability, equity and social justice, decentralisation and devolution, and self reliance. 

&gt; They want to get rid of both fossil fuels and nuclear power.

So they should. Fossil fuels are disgusting and every major country- apart from the US agrees with that. Nuclear power is a controversial issue, I can understand their skepticism, it is not renewable and does cause horrific toxic waste that damages the environment, the greens have in recent times been more open to nuclear energy but will always and rightly so advocate for renewable energy and tech. 

&gt; They want an end to animal testing

As is morally right to do so. 

&gt;  something which would destroy our pharmaceutical and biotech sectors.

Not at all, the industry can still work without the use of animal testing. 

&gt;basically means open borders.

Open borders. What a horrific idea that only evil people would propose for example the European union... oh wait.

&gt; They're completely batshit insane,

You have yet to prove that, all your points are either lies or misinformation. Also the leader of the Greens are: Jonathan Bartley and Sian Berry. It is always better to attack a parties manifesto rather than trying to attack one person in the green party.

1575,"&gt; Texas has a free market economy and as a result attracts businesses and people from all over the country.

Actually it's the opposite.  Texas gives more special incentives to politically-connected corporations than any other state.  

These incentives are negotiated by political insiders who act as lobbyists for corporate clients.

https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/03/us/winners-and-losers-in-texas.html

So it's not a free market, because the government creates an uneven playing field where the well-connected get sweetheart deals in exchange for moving to Texas.

Other than Texas, Republican states are poorer than most Democratic ones, like California, New York, Washington, Massachusetts, Illinois, etc.; those states also give special incentives to businesses (though not to the extent that Texas does), so the reason that I'm mentioning them is because they show that it's not low taxes or fewer regulations that attract businesses, it's government largesse - rich states have the cash to throw around as corporate incentives, and poor states don't.

Look at how American cities acted when Amazon said it was looking for a place to build a new headquarters: They stumbled over themselves trying to make bigger and better offers of corporate welfare.

You can see more evidence in Kansas's recent history.  They tried slashing taxes and government services to attract businesses, and it failed.  The state's an economic disaster.  Reduced regulations and lower taxes didn't attract many businesses to a state that couldn't afford to offer big incentives.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9ttjrg/this_is_poland/e901rtt/,executivemonkey,1541285724

1629,"Ok, I have read the thing, here are my insights.

&gt; Under the Law on the State Language, it is not possible to impose a fine for the use of a language. The sanction can only be imposed if the state language is not used where the law so requires. A regular citizen can not get a fine because Article 9a specifically mentions who can get the fine and the common citizen there is not. In this case, the fine can only be received by a state authority and a public administration body.

Yeah, but what are those cases? That's why I asked you to link the text of the law.

&gt; There is no censorship in the State Language Act with regard to the inscriptions on memorials and memorial plaques. The Ministry of Culture will not issue such inscriptions or approve, it will only issue opinions in which it will assess whether the inscription on the future memorial, memorial or memorial meets the criteria under the Act on the State Language.

And what happens if the memorial does not meet the criteria? What are the criteria?

&gt; The Ministry of Culture will not oversee the use of languages ​​in historical inscriptions placed on objects of special cultural value over 50 years of age. In the course of supervision, the Ministry focuses mainly on newer inscriptions, because older ones should already be regulated under Section 11 of the Act in force until 1 January 1997.

Why regulate at all actually? There is no such regulation in Hungary right now, not even now when our aspiring dictator tries to rewrite history almost daily.

&gt; Accompanying cultural events intended for national minorities are also provided in the state language whenever it is a publicly accessible event at which a citizen of another nationality can speak at any time in the state language. Do not let such a person participate in a public event, or to prevent him from participating because of his ethnicity is inadmissible under the Constitution and such discrimination is prohibited in the territory of the Slovak Republic.

Yeah, that smells like bullshit. No one wants to *prevent* Slovaks to show up on such events, but what if not one is there nonetheless? Why should a bunch of Rusins speak Slovak then? Or what if I want to speak Latin? That would be understood by no one, so it's non-discriminatory too. So can I speak in Latin but not in Hungarian and Rusin? Or I can only use Slovak?

&gt; Schools with the language of instruction of a national minority must have a pedagogical and so- further documentation bilingual, j. in the state language and in the language of the respective minority. (Without going into the state language, the supervision of state authorities in the field of education would not be possible.) The requirement for the bilingual management of pedagogical documentation has been enforced in the past by SMK

Hehe :D So, just like the brutal and oppressive 1883/XXX? :D

&gt;No, this is a lie

The Apponyi Laws (1907) were drafted and passed, granting the government official  rights  to  turn  all  Slovak elementary schools into Hungarian and decree  that  the  Slovak  language  was only to be taught one hour per week as a foreign language. That's the fact, you can see it in the Apponyi law itself, if you link it here.

&gt;This is even funnier for me, because the laws you have besmirched above also specify (e. g. 1883/XXX) 

You're intentionally misinterpreting me. The Apponyi laws were passed in 1907, not 1883.

&gt;While I concede that in 2009 at least Slovakia refrained from closure of Hungarian-speaking institutions, that was not the case in the interwar period,

Can you tell me which Hungarian institutions were closed during the First Czechoslovak Republic? And concentrating on the years 45-48 is silly, since for those three years Hungary was being punished for trying to destroy Czechoslovakia. Hungarians were once equal after 1948.

Three years of bad treatment of Hungarians versus how many decades of bad treatment of Slovaks? The Hungarians still had it easier.

1688,"&gt; So you're not responding to the Hungarians shutting down of Matica Slovenska? The 2009 Slovak Language law did not outlaw Hungarian organizations.

That was not a law, it was a ministerial decree, and thus the outcome of the zeal of one subgroup of the government rather than oppressive nature of the whole state administration. While closing down such an institution is bad enough, for the everyday life the minority right to the usage of own language was still protected by law, which is the exact opposite than what the 2009 law does.

&gt; Beginning with the 1879 Primary Education Act and the 1883 Secondary Education Act, the Hungarian state made more efforts to reduce the use of non-Magyar languages, in strong violation of the 1868 Nationalities Law. Source: Robert Bideleux and Ian Jeffries, A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change, Routledge, 1998

The 1879/XVIII, and the 1883/XXX. were really quite brutal, they made Hungarian a non-electable subject in those schools where it wasn't obligatory yet. Can you imagine the horror if in current Slovakia or Romania Hungarian students had to learn Romanian or Slovakian? Yeah, me neither.

The other relevant paragraphs of the 1879 law are more debatable, it has forbidden to give teaching diploma those who are not able to speak, read and write in Hungarian. While I do not agree with this stance, I doubt it would be very much different in current Slovakia or Romania, since Slovakian and Romanian in these countries are non-electable Abitur-subjects, so anyone ever coming close to a diploma will already speak them to a certain level. *These laws did nothing however to restrict the usage of minority languages, [here](https://net.jogtar.hu/ezer-ev-torveny?docid=87900018.TV&amp;searchUrl=/ezer-ev-torvenyei%3Fextraparams%3D%7B%2522ID%2522%3A%2522FullTextSearch%2522%2C%2522Year%2522%3A%25221879%2522%2C%2522Kibocsato%2522%3A%2522TV0%2522%7D) and [here](https://net.jogtar.hu/ezer-ev-torveny?docid=88300030.TV&amp;searchUrl=/ezer-ev-torvenyei%3Fextraparams%3D%7B%2522ID%2522%3A%2522FullTextSearch%2522%2C%2522Year%2522%3A%25221883%2522%2C%2522Kibocsato%2522%3A%2522TV0%2522%7D) are the full text of the laws, you can see them for yourself.

&gt; The number of minority-language schools was steadily decreasing: in the period between 1880 and 1913, when the number of Hungarian-only schools almost doubled, the number of minority language-schools almost halved. Source: Romsics, Ignác. Magyarország története a huszadik században (""A History of Hungary in the 20th Century"".

That mainly happened under the second Wekerle-government, which was mainly a concession to the '48 coalition. What can I say? Far right gonna far right, this outcome was still better than an '48-style civil war.

&gt; The process of Magyarization culminated in 1907 with the lex Apponyi (named after education minister Albert Apponyi) which forced all primary school children to read, write and count in Hungarian for the first four years of their education. From 1909 religion also had to be taught in Hungarian. Source: Teich, Mikuláš; Dušan Kováč; Martin D. Brown (2011). Slovakia in History. Cambridge University Press

That is the 1906 government again, doing their usual thing. It probably would have been revoked given time, sadly there were other debates going on under the subsequent governments (like the Armed Forces debates), which needed all the political munition liberals could scrape together. Also, 

&gt; which forced all primary school children to read, write and count in Hungarian for the first four years of their education

this statement is simply false, the text of the law requires that students at the age of 10 should be able to read, write and count in Hungarian, but it leaves the methods to the school's discretion.

In the Paclisanu (who has not much love for Hungarians either) book, I linked above you can see, that in 1914 there were 2,578 Romanian primary schools in the Kingdom, out of 17378, which roughly corresponds to the Romanian percentage in the Kingdom's population (15 vs 16%).

&gt; The Hungarian secondary school is like a huge machine, at one end of which the Slovak youths are thrown in by the hundreds, and at the other end of which they come out as Magyars. — Béla Grünwald, adviser to Count Kálmán Tisza, Hungarian prime minister from 1875 to 1890

Grünwald was definitely not the adviser to Tisza in 1890, since he was ousted from the liberal party in 1880, mainly because of his role around the Matrica Slovenska closure, and his vile point of view about minorities by the way. His further political career was a series of failures, he was even despised by the right wing opposition, and he committed suicide in 1891 in total political isolation, and final desperation.",Sed ornat,/r/europe/comments/9tskt2/exactly_100_years_ago_on_this_day_austriahungary/e8zlv4j/,Ugocsa_non__coronat,1541269947

Whatever tenuous amount of information, seemly just IP traces to some UK companies, your government had to tie UK intel to this op came from the security service. Regardless of where it went, information was leaked from your service and as such proved the correctness of the position of non collaboration.

It was noticed afterwards, not during. It's basically impossible to not leave anything behind that would be discoverable eventually by someone of middling competence.

""reportedly"", ""apparently"", ""possibly"".

The 1868 nationality law specified that every court and governmental office had to conduct business on minority-languages as well, should a citizen of non-Hungarian ethnicity be involved. This law wasn't amended later it was in force for the whole duration of dualism.

The harshest law in the era (from ethnic minority point of view) was the 1907 lex Apponyi which made the requirement that at the age of 10 students should be able to speak, read, write and count in Hungarian on basic level.

All in all the 2009 Slovakian language law is harsher and more oppressing than anything implemented under the dualism.

The most oppressing thing in the dualism was that the career opportunities were not equal for the constituent ethnicities, it was very hard to rise above a level in the state administration or in political life if you didn't speak German or Hungarian.

&gt; 
&gt; 

The source is BBC. The BBC article linked here. It says:

* *The National Crime Agency is investigating Arron Banks and his Leave.EU campaign for alleged offences committed at the 2016 EU referendum.*

 *Mr Banks and another senior campaign figure, Liz Bilney, were referred to the agency by the Electoral Commission.*

 *The watchdog said it suspected Mr Banks was not the ""true source"" of loans to the campaign and the money had come ""from impermissible sources"".*

&gt; But currently there is nothing

In the democratic west, the job of the press is to ask the hard questions. Not sure how it works in other parts of the world. 

&gt; when there is no evidence.....

There **used to** not be evidence that spied were assassinated using polonium 209 either. And there **used to** not be evidence that mysterious amounts of money and support were turning up in French elections. And there **used to** not be evidence that the Saudis assassinated a lead critic on foreign soil.

Guess that why some people don't like it when the western press asks hard questions

1986,"&gt;No, because as per your own article the Belgian security and government service is clearly full of leaks so if the Brits let them know about their efforts in this matter it probably would have been leaked either by incompetence or by maliciousness which would have foreworned targets and disclosed methods, neither of which are acceptable.

Is it malicious or incompetent to let it go out to the press when allies spy on you and cause damage? Mate it's a state owned company. We don't need to start some secret hacking operation to do this shit and the hypotheticals you pull up about leaky secret service and incompetence don't seem all too apt when what you base it on was the ""leaking"" of your secret services actions directly to the press. All in all that seems pretty purposefull unlike the getting caught on this hack, the tapping into israeli drones, the spying on allies at gG20 summits, hacking into the Pakistan internet exchange, etc, etc

2. Dude, show some respect. You well know that despite the fact romanians were the majority in Transylvania even in austrian and hungarian censuses, they were discriminated against and only considered ''tolerated''. Which also means they were not allowed to live in towns for centuries. Who's fault was that? They could only live in towns and become part of the nobility if they accepted magyarization. Some examples of magyarized romanians that led Transylvania or even Hungary were Iancu de Hunedoara that became Janos Hunyadi (his son Matthias was half romanian too). the Dragosesti family (it became Draggfy), etc. But I'm sure they didn't build anything either. /s
3. Romanians were usually the main labour hand in constructions and they had to pay up to the rulers no matter hungarians, turks or austrians. So I wouldn't say they contributed with nothing like you hypocritically claim.
4. This sort of accussations can go the other way around too. Not only hungarians were the [minority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_and_religious_composition_of_Austria-Hungary) in Transylvania, but they were the minority even in Budapest till like 100-150 years ago. Germans were the [majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Budapest) till then. Things only started to change during Austria-Hungary when the new [magyarization](http://feefhs.org/region/banat-german-settlements) wave started. So who built most of the buildings in the historical centre of Budapest if not the germans? Same goes for Prague and other big cities that were part of the Austria Empire.

This was held in various sources until around 644 C.E. when the third caliph Uthman came out with The Version of the quran we know today, in the process he also got rid of all the other versions and copies.

&gt;The first major threat to Croatian Glagolitic since it attained stability was from the Ottoman excursions, though the extent of cultural damage varied locally depending on the course of war. In the 17th century, though, the first successful direct attack on the script since the 12th century was headed by the Bishop of Zagreb, and after the Magnate conspiracy left the script without secular protectors, its use was limited to the littoral region. In the meantime, printing gradually overtook handwriting for liturgical manuscripts, resulting in a decline of the majuscule script, which was absorbed for titular and sometimes initial use within for minuscule documents. It was not until the late 18th century and the onset of modernity that Glagolitic received significant further threats, and through western influence, especially secular, Glagolitic culture collapsed, so that by the mid 19th century, the script was purely liturgical, relying mostly on printed materials. By the time of the devastating Italianization movements under Fascist Italy in the early 20th century, numerous independent events had already greatly reduced the area of the liturgical use of Glagolitic.",,/r/europe/comments/9tto57/croatian_language_900_years_ago/e8z0px0/,[deleted],1541249244

I had no idea there were still some Austro-Slavists alive.

&gt;What you wrote now was mostly high politics that wasn't important for real life that much.

If that were true then why there were VIOLENT protests surrounding these issues?

You clearly [don't know anything about the situation in Austria-Hungary](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C5%99edlitavsko#N%C3%A1rodnostn%C3%AD_ot%C3%A1zka_v_P%C5%99edlitavsku)

&gt;Dlouhodobým destabilizujícím faktorem vnitřní situace v Předlitavsku byla etnická otázka. Národnostní situace se v Předlitavsku ani po roce 1867 neuklidnila... problémem bylo, že ústava nebyla dostatečně jasná například v definici pojmu zemského jazyka nebo národnosti, což vedlo k tomu, že **její interpretace byla od začátku politizována.**

&gt;Ústředním problémem se stal po roce 1867 především národnostní konflikt česko-německý, který měl ale minimálně dvě dimenze, které se samozřejmě ovlivňovaly:

*     státoprávní spor o české státní právo, který v podstatě volal po zavedení trialismu či federace a chápal dualismus jako potlačení českých státoprávních práv. Tento konflikt zahrnoval vedle Čechů a českých Němců také centrální vládu ve Vídni. V první etapě po roku 1867 vedl k tomu, že česká politické reprezentace obstruovala Říšskou radu na znamení nesouhlasu se současným uspořádáním (tzv. pasivní rezistence). Obstrukce trvala do roku 1879. Poté následovala tzv. drobečková politika, která skončila v roce 1890 totálním volebním propadem jejich hlavních protagonistů, staročechů. Na konci 19. století se české strany uchýlily spíše k politickému realismu a snažili se získat nadvládu v Čechách. Centrální vláda na jednu stranu odmítala další federalizaci říše, která by podle jejího názoru vedla k dalšímu politickému roztříštění, ale na druhou stranu si uvědomovala citlivost vztahu mezi Čechy a Němci v Čechách a především se obávala nárůstu velkoněmeckého nacionalismu mezi českými Němci.
* vlastní česko-německý spor v Čechách a na Moravě, který se také dotýkal problematiky českého historického práva a otázky federalizace monarchie, kterou odmítali jak čeští Němci tak vídeňské centrum. Čeští Němci si uvědomovali, že další vyrovnání s Čechy by oslabilo jejich postavení v Čechách a na Moravě. Český výklad ústavy a z ní vyplývajících zákonů ale požadoval zavedení češtiny jako jazyka veřejné i správní komunikace po celém území země a nikoliv jen v oblastech kde žili Češi. To čeští Němci odmítali a požadovali udržení privilegovaného postavení němčiny ve správě monarchie bez ohledu na proporcionální podíl neněmecky hovořícího obyvatelstva. Centrální vláda se několikrát pokusila o řešení česko-německého národnostního problému v Čechách: Stremayrova jazyková nařízení (1880) uznávala rovnoprávné postavení češtiny ve vnějším styku na území Čech i Moravy. Na základě tohoto ustanovení pak došlo v roce 1882 k rozdělení Karlo-Ferdinandovy univerzity na českou a německou. V roce 1890 byly navrženy vídeňské punktace, které znovu upravovaly jazykové vztahy mezi Němci a Čechy v tom smyslu, že by německá území zůstala německojazyčná a česká území dvojjazyčná, což byl kompromis, který česká strana odmítla. Konečně se vláda Kasimira Badeniho pokusila o další narovnání. Tzv. Badeniho jazyková nařízení z roku 1897 potvrdila Stremayorova nařízení a v některých případech dokonce umožňovala užít češtinu jako jazyk vnitřního styku čímž narazila na rozhodný odpor německých stran, které v roce 1899 dosáhly úplného odvolání všech jazykových nařízení. Na Moravě byla národnostní situace poněkud odlišná. Zde se v roce 1905 podařilo naleznout funkční kompromis tzv. moravským vyrovnáním.Snahou Gautschovy vlády, která kompromis napomohla sjednat, bylo aby se moravské vyrovnání stalo modelem pro řešení situace v Čechách, avšak to mělo v Čechách jen malou odezvu. **Česko-německý konflikt vyvrcholí v roce 1908 německou obstrukcí českého zemského sněmu v Praze a českou obstrukcí Říšské rady.**

By 1914 the situation in Czech lands became critical and Masaryk correctly identified that dissolving the monarchy was the only solution. This is why he left Austria-Hungary to begin his quest.

2254,"&gt; we have the last 600 years with a massive invasion once a century 

every goddam country has experienced the same. Russia is not special in that regard (as much as its people like to pretend it is). However Russia is special in that they are still choosing to buy tanks instead of building normal roads for their people just like they did in 1950's, while Europe and the rest of developed World is doing the opposite. Nobudy in NATO spends more than 3% of GDP on military, not even the Americans (Russia spends 20%) 

Its not about mistrusting the West, its about opposite.....its about Russian leaders not caring about their own people and instead using their money to create military that can attack other countries and widen their influence over their neighbors so their oligarchs in power can cash in even more money for themselves. Soviets did the same shit, their Red army was not for ''defense'', never was, not when it was created and not in pre-World war 2 era either, it was for offense.

Turbo-folk is something completely different. Turbo-folk had it's heyday during the wars, but it's not about the war itself. Most turbo-folk lyrics are about love or partying. It's cheap escapist entertainment.

It started developing in the 80's with introduction of synthesizers and rhythm machines to folk music but didn't have it's boom until the nineties when newly opened privately owned TV and radio station started playing them.

A few examples of turbo-folk.

seriously? seriously? what happenned on October 10th? Why did they ""declared independence"" on the 27th?

after six years and I don't know how many elections, votes, law proposals, public debates, speeches, demonstrations, etc, they ""suddenly realised"" they had no way of actually enforcing independence? **Really**?? Just voted and said, ""oh look, we can't"". 

Can you honestly tell me when did you started following the Catalan situation, if you actually did before October 27th 2017? Can you be candid about that? 

We know **now** what their plans were, we know what was offered to them, which international recognitions were prepared, which loans were agreed, which international personalities offered themselves to serve as mediators with spain, there is a lot of extremely heated debate in the proindependence camp about all of this but unless you know Catalan and know who to read and hear (few programs are covering this) you will not know. 

There are Catalan Foreign office workers which had detailed accounts of what was happening there in the couple of years prior to the referendum, the information they are giving is completely in agreement with what I'm telling you. They were not preparing independence, they turned down external aid offers, they didn't followed policy recommendations, etc.

There are interesting ambiguities that exist when you have a dialect continuua, but language is generally taken to mean a mutually intelligible form of communication among a group of people. If you used the criteria that a shared history of change uniquely identifies a language, then old English is the same language as Anglo-Frisian. Anglo-Frisian would be the same language as Proto Low Germanic. Dutch would *also* be the same language as Proto Low Germanic. That would mean English is the same language as Dutch. And Proto Low Germanic would be same language as the language of (and later derivatives of) all the Germanic languages like Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic, and the languages of the Goths.

2660,"&gt; I can't believe you're denying the actually events that happened it seems like you don't want to admit that you declare independence and the Spanish didn't even take it seriously

And I believe that your dislike for the proindependence makes you say things that didn't happen based on an interested narrative, something all too common in many spanish nationalists (interestingly you sem to be a Cuban, which would fit your preferences though). 

What I'm saying is that most of the people now in jail and most of the people now in exile (I'm sure you wouldn't deny they are in exile, not even you can twist the legal facts of that) lied and betrayed their supporters. They said they were preparing for independence when in reality they were actually doing a show to improve their chances at negotiating with spain, which is extremely stupid. They didn't declare independence because they never wanted it, they never prepared for it despite what they said and **now** we know about it. 

&gt; and the Spanish didn't even take it seriously

I'm sure we are all civilised beings here, can you read thrice what you just wrote? this is the complete opposite of what you are saying, WHAT THE HELL. If anything spain took it so seriously that they are accusing of ""rebellion"", the harshest sentence there is in spanish penal code, even the guy who wrote the law is saying that it is being applied incorrectly, since there should have been an actual military armed rebellion for that. Those guys, the former catalan government, did not actually try to get independence, they lied, and spain got so fucking scared that they applied full force against it as if it had been an actual rebellion.

And you know why is spain acting like this? Because had the Catalan government not turned out to be a bunch of traitors and liars, there was no way spain could have stopped hundreds of thousands of unarmed civilians from taking physical control of catalonia short of shooting them. The massive mobilisation of the proindependence camp is what scared the shit out of the spanish government, several spanish military figures even admitted that even at full stregth the spanish military *and* the police had no manpower and resources to mantain an occupation of even a pacifically resisting Catalonia.

2678,"&gt;I suppose you mean Portugal and Spain.

Actually, I'm more concern with the opinion of people from Olivença than anyone else (yes, I already know you disagree).

&gt; People's opinions is mostly worthless and volatile.

Then what's the point of having a democracy at all?

&gt;. Few talk of Olivença today, should there be escalation they will.

And since there aren't, there isn't a big deal. 

&gt; Also yes it was a couple of centuries ago, and while Spain has the upper hand in the status quo Portugal also never let go of it.

Neither should start diplomatic frictions over it.


&gt;Firstly importance is just an assumption of yours.

Of course, as it is also your opinion that is a very relevant issue. 


&gt;Should you pay attention to international affairs you'd know Spain have been fairly lousy. 

I don't see how that shows anywhere that England is a closer ally or more important economically for Portugal. It's not as if the Treaty of Windsor had now any relevance in Portugal besides it's historical perspective. 

&gt; I'm not. I'm saying it is the norm. If you look back 50, 100, 150 years you see a world that is always in deep change. Spain isn't exactly stable either. 

The norm of what should to be doesn't mean it has to come in the same as before. Neither the historical conflicts with Spain should be a reason to know create unnecessary issues over Olivença. 

&gt;     As I said, being different is irrelevant. But also we don't mostly because we won.

Is relevant because you want to be irrelevant. Even during Filipe's dynasty, Portuguese people weren't as oppressed as many were under Russian occupations. 

&gt;None of this is relevant to my answer.

I usually like to discuss with you but you said this too often. In here you are again saying that Portuguese opinions on their own Foreign Affairs are irrelevant. I can't agree with that. 

&gt;All territorial disputes are important. If they weren't they wouldn't exist.

Not really. Some territorial disputes are far more complicated than others. Be to the strategic place of the region or because some minorities are mistreated. 

&gt; How they are handled at a given point in time is a matter of diplomacy and geopolitics. And that depends on both sides and on the context. 

And for now, Oliveça is in águas de bacalhau, with no reason at all to take it out.

Did it lead to religious freedom? No, the reformed churches would kill you if you didn't belong to their sect.

Did it help end tyranny? No, Luther favored submission to absolute monarchy and the protestant states were despotic hellholes by the standards of the time.

&gt;. Luther copied important elements of the extremely conservative Roman Catholic ideology and even amplified them. People who stood at the bottom of the societal ladder or who deviated from the dominant standards, could count on his excessive hate. Together his writing form one big rant against Jews, women, nonbelievers, farmers and handicapped, and furthermore against everyone who didn't want to subject to the tyranny of the nobility and royalty. Subjects would never be allowed to resist the authority of the state, because that power was ""given by God"". ""It's better when tyrants commit 100 injustices against the people, than when the people commit one single injustice against the tyrants"", according to Luther. ""As bad the administration may be, God would still prefer to tolerate it's existence, than to allow the rabble to mutiny, no matter how rightful it would be.

2700,"&gt;Why are you pretending you are seeking actionable solutions and don't just daydream about immediate and universal deportations?

Where are you reading I want universal deportations? I would like to see a quote for this, since it is a pretty big accusation.

&gt;Do you not think the mask has slipped far enough just yet, are you still trying to keep up appearances?

What mask and appearances? Except for the ones you read into my post.

&gt;Yes, 300 cases of crime committed by some members of a group of over 160.000 people do not merit discussing how we should treat that group altogether.

Where did I say we should treat the whole group altogether? I did not.

&gt; There is no discussion to be had, because 99.5% or more of them aren't part of the problem you are trying to fix. 

If the 0,5% is causing problems, it is useful to talk about how to fix that. Every rape or assault is one too many, so we should look at ways to fix that. We do this all the time when trying to solve problems. We just don't just go: only 0,5% of cars randomly catch on fire, so that's ok. Or only 0,5% of food is poisoned, so that is ok. No, we look at ways to deal with that.

&gt; If you are on a boat of 500 people and you hear there was a theft on board, do you suggest everyone gets arrested instead of trying to find out who the 2 culprits are?

If I am on a boat with 500 people were there is a major violent crime, I sure as hell would like the captain to take every precaution to prevent it happening again. If on every boat ride with 500 people someone gets raped or murdered, the company arranging these trips should damn well fix that or cancel the trips.

&gt;Somehow I don't quite see you extending the very same logic to literally any other scenario.

Do you? Should we stop talking about problems with rape, because only a small percentage of men commit one? Should we stop talking about far right extremism, because only a small percentage of people commit them?

&gt;Should we ban driving because 0.2% of drivers (or whatever number) drive drunk?

No. But we do have police checks in areas where more drunk drivers are spotted, don't we?

&gt;Should we ban guns, because some gun-owners kill?

Guns are banned in Holland, we do just fine without them. Ban away for all I care.

&gt;Should we ban AfD, because among their voters, there are most certainly more than 0.1% who are neo-Nazis?

Where did I propose we ""ban"" refugees? I did not. So your comparison makes no sense.

2708,"You think so? Most of the recent governments in my country (past 30 years) have been center right wing. Sometimes a left government, and we even once had a ""purple"" government, composed of (european) Liberals, Socialists, greens and the center party (also liberals but different ones).

Most of our left leaning governments were directly after the war, and the same sentiment was shared over most of (democratic) europe.



Some european countries (the south) have had more left leaning governments. I am not sure about the swedish government composition.

I think it is a common misconception that we are moving to the left. Maybe untill the 70's, but ever since the 90' liberals (which is right wing, they are usually the ""economy"" party) have gained more influence. Though many liberals are seen as socially progressive, they are right wing in their economics. 

So, it's not that we are moving in directions, it's more that the terms right wing and left wing have become hard to distinguish. Left wingers are those that want higher (proportional) taxes, forced free market, bigger government and more safety nets. Right wingers are those that want smaller government, less taxes, less safety nets, truly free market.

Left wing has been more open to immigrants, but here is the joke, right wing parties as well. Do you know what happens when you get more immigrants? GDP goes up. Economy looks good.

Personally, I'm comfortable with the idea that I don't possess the knowledge to have a technical discussion about the relevant aspects of police or social work and how it should be improved, and not only because this is reddit. I'll leave that up to the experts who had spent a lifetime honing their skills to know what is likely to work and what isn't. Fantasizing about what ifs leads to nowhere. It's also pointless to make banal statements such as 'even one rape is too many', because everyone knows that. 

Even if you in particular are after a workable solution, most of the people pushing these threads aren't. They want to fool people with a mirage of mayhem that benefits the political side they are literal fans (or fanatics) of. 

If you've spent some time here, you probably spotted how frequently anti-refugee posts are submitted by a tiny group of accounts, definitely single digit number of them. The current OP being a member and his submission history is quite the sight. 

They don't wish to discuss the issue of rape or assault or pedophilia as a whole, only if the perpetrators are of the right kind to fuel their agenda. You can even spot how selective they are in their love for transparency and hard data: it's always limited to percentage instead of sums. Because they are well aware you can't scare people to death with the idea of a 68 cases of rape, so you have to reframe that and say 56.8% of their victims were German. They want to remove any and all context and frame of reference and magnify real issues up a thousandfold, in order to convince unsuspecting people that the world is on fire.

Keep some basic respect here please. Many countries gave their opinion in a political conflict situation which was of interest of their public and also at the behest of spain, which asked all of them to make such declarations (some notably didn't or took a lot of time, like Slovenia or Israel or Japan, which I feel sorry for). 

What is the *basic* fact?

When countries declare independence they are the ones responsible to **officially ask** for international recognition, which then is given or is not given. In fact the document read by the Catalan government on the 27th **did not ask for international recognition**. This document was carefully worded to avoid that precisely.

- In the EU countries that report population by country of birth, the total is 1.265.947, or 12.3% of the population of Portugal. However, that does not include some very important countries that don't offer data by ""country of birth"" (they do it only by citizenship) like Germany. 
- Moreover, this of course only includes only migration to the EU. I searched for a few more countries: 176,638 in the USA; 137.972 in Brazil; 139.450 in Canada. That's already 1.720.007, or 16.7% of the population. 
- If we use ""Portuguese citizens in Germany"" as a proxy for Portuguese-born in Germany, that adds 124.753: now we have 1.844.760. That's pretty close to 2 million, and lots of countries missing. Those countries will have much less Portuguese migrants, but still.

These are very crazy numbers if we compare it to other countries, even with those hit by the debt crisis. Take the other Iberian nation, Spain.

2887,"&gt; I haven't read the report

The claim about 40 deaths a day doesn't seem to appear in the report itself. Perhaps the title of this topic is out of line, I wouldn't know, but I can't find that specific number in the report itself.

If you wanna blame OP for that, fine, but you cannot blame it on this report, cause it doesn't mention it.

&gt;Russia's total murder rate was less than 10 per 100000 since 2012

According to Wiki, it's a bit above 10, actually. But I don't wanna split hairs here. Around 10 is freaking high.

We have a rate of less than 1 over here.

&gt;Unfortunately I cannot find any link to support it.

How convenient. Strange how that always happens when people make bold claims.

But *most* importantly, and listen up here, cause you might learn a thing or two, you're talking about the *murder rate*. Your own sources say that ""12,000 women are killed annually in Russia as a result of domestic violence"", which doesn't mean they are murdered per se. Murder is something [entirely different](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2013/07/01/what-is-the-difference-between-murder-and-manslaughter) than death caused by domestic violence, so your ""proof"" doesn't mean shit. Really, your evidence is worthless, cause most deaths caused by domestic violence most likely aren't murder.

So the number could still be true and it wouldn't surprise me if it was.

But you go ahead and deny that.

I mean it doesn't, at least in the west, if a man wants to a stay at home dad or a women wants to forgo having children to run a company they can. They don't need surgery or for people to refer to them by something other than the gender they were born with to do that.

2923,"&gt; And, in this case, it matters how both sides of the population (Portugal and Olivença) see the issue. 

I suppose you mean Portugal and Spain. 

Most people are home jacking of to Porn Hub. People's opinions is mostly worthless and volatile. For a long time pretty much no one talked about the annexation of Timor-Leste in Portugal (and a genocide was going on there). And eventually they did. It was always an issue.   Few talk of Olivença today, should there be escalation they will. It's an issue regardless. A disputed territory is an issue.

&gt; That's correct. But it's been more than 200 years now. Any reclaim won't be to successful. Also, not that I disagree with your point, but treaties are indeed broken quite often. 

You're using bad logic. 

Treaties are broken all the time. And there's consequences to broken treaties all the time. Also yes it was a couple of centuries ago, and while Spain has the upper hand in the status quo Portugal also never let go of it.

&gt; Waste of time to spend too many efforts on it. 

Precisely because at the time it wouldn't pay off, it's the modus operandis is low key. That has nothing to it being an issue. That's a remark about a current status quo in the dispute. 

&gt; The point is that Portugal has many positions too defend on its relation with Spain and this is the least relevant one.

So many wrong things here. 

Firstly importance is just an assumption of yours. Secondly this has nothing to do with it being an issue or not, but with management of effort. Thirdly having more disputes if anything is a reason to hold on to this diplomatic capital (""pressure us here we'll pressure you there and there"").

&gt; &gt; It can be used to undermine Spain's position in Gibraltar, favouring our British allies

&gt; It's very debatable if, at this point, the British are more our allies than the Spanish. 

Anything is debatable. This would be an easy debate. Should you pay attention to international affairs you'd know Spain have been fairly lousy. 

But it's also irrelevant. That was just an example to explain why it is diplomatic capital even if one had no hopes of getting it back (and I'm not saying one shouldn't). 

&gt; The Earth can even be hit by a meteorite before I finish my comment. 

This is disingenuous. You're talking about very low probability events. I'm not. I'm saying it is the norm. If you look back 50, 100, 150 years you see a world that is always in deep change. Spain isn't exactly stable either. 

&gt; Very different situation.

It doesn't matter. This isn't about the situation but the reasoning. 

When you reason you use both premisses and inference rules. Your inference rules are wrong. Telling me the premiss is different is irrelevant.  

&gt; Second, despite all the wars with Spain, we don't have the same background of occupation 

As I said, being different is irrelevant. But also we don't mostly because we won.


&gt; The compromises in NI were needed, as was a complicated issue for both sides. While for most Portuguese, Olivença isn't an issue. 

None of this is relevant to my answer. 

&gt; Letting go or making it an important issue are different things.

All territorial disputes are important. If they weren't they wouldn't exist. How they are handled at a given point in time is a matter of diplomacy and geopolitics. And that depends on both sides and on the context.

3020,"&gt; all it needs to do is improve performance of the procedure.

That is wrong.
Beside the fact that every police and every security organisation has only finite resources and as such false positive warnings will drain and block them, to think that there will be other checks is naïve. 
The goal behind such technology is to get rid of the 'procedure'.

&gt;  
&gt;they did not answer any of the questions of the opposing parties that represented half the population of Catalonia  
&gt;  
&gt;They refuse to debate at all levels

It was debated. Actually that day the Parliament session lasted until 11 or 12pm if I'm not wrong.

&gt;They passed a reform of their consitution without the needed 2/3 of their parliament

The laws that made the referendum possible were not a reform of the constitution. The reform of the constitution would have been the declaration of independence, which was never made legal, it was just a symbolic vote in the Parliament.

&gt;then proceed to close the parliament for 3 straight weeks before the referendum to avoid debate

Like in any other election or referendum.

&gt;they mismanaged public funds

That hasn't been proved yet, and it looks it never will because it looks like the referendum was payed with private money.

&gt;used their own police in an illegal way

How? I would say in all this conflict the Catalan police behaved much better than the Spanish one, and I'm not only speaking about the day of the referendum, but also about the Spanish police trying to illegally enter the headquarters of a Catalan party or them fabricating proofs against activists (read about Adria Carrasco and Tamara Carrasco).",Europe,/r/europe/comments/9tj3zb/spain_prosecutor_calls_for_jailed_catalan_leaders/e8x6bn1/,SmallSpiderChef,1541176744

3126,"&gt;  I said Czech alone received double the amount that entire western europe did following WW2. 

You also could say that Czechs received triple the amount that Julius Caesar paid for his Gaul Campaign. It was just irrelevant gibberish by you.

&gt; So now its the size of the country and not ""*When we were thrown in ""real life"", our competitiveness was abysmal. Hence, that huge drop that happened basically in every post-communist country.*""? Your arguments are all over the place. 

Come on! Comparing the competitiveness of a small economy and one of the biggest is huge nonsense by you. If you want to compare EU and China, then it is ok. But China and Czech Republic? You cannot be serious.

What I meant is that the competitiveness of Czech enterprises in early 1990's comparing to relevant markets (like Austria, Germany, etc.) was abysmal. Machinery was outdated (sometimes from pre-war era), quality management sphere was non-existent, people weren't used to compete on job market and during communism there wasn't much motivation to improve yourself which caused really hard time for those who simply didn't meet basic knowledge conditions. Communism simply fucked things up.

&gt; you are saying Czech didnt get freedomz after dissolution of SU and didnt get free cash from EU 

Free cash from EU is ridiculous argument. We sent tons of money to EU budget as well. That we happened to be net receiver? I don't care. In the standard social benefits system, some people also get more money than they sent into budget. And usually those people are the poorest ones. Will you also bad-mouth them? 

&gt; Nah, just laughing at excuses you guys love to make. Really havent heard that one before. 

Wow, you claimed how evil colonial powers of the West were and then you clearly denied that Soviet Union was colonial power as well. By your POV, SO should be colonial power but it seems you ignore the fact.

&gt; I don't have to source you anything. Just freaking learn history! 

Your first claim was we lost 30 years of growth and you never proved it or at least backed up with facts. Just with made up stuff based on one graph.

And I asked you in which area Eastern Bloc surpassed the West. Since you were unable to answer I will assume in none.

&gt; GDP is measurement of market... Competitiveness is an ability of a firm to sell goods. Apples and oranges... 

It correlates with each other. Competitiveness actually is no measurement like GDP is. You cannot quite objectively count it. However, you can create an aggregate index. And GDP could be part of the index.

&gt; And yet somehow the entire eastern block GDP grew up until dissolution of the block. Magic, right? 

Every GDP generally grows. If it doesn't then either stagnation or recession happens. That's economics 101. Bad thing is when you forcefully try to push growth even though the economy isn't prepared for it. And that's exactly what happened in Eastern Bloc. Constant effort to have growing GDP. Btw. the growth in communist countries was generally worse than in the capitalist West.

&gt;  I literally looked at your graph that you linked. You **still** havent reached 2008 level of GDP. 

Because the biggest economy crisis since the Great Depression happened? Maybe that is the answer? 

It certainly doesn't have anything to do with the dissolution of Eastern Bloc.

So no legit argument by you here,

&gt; Slovenia  ...  I lived in Yugoslavia. Lets just say that average person got fucked hard by capitalism. 

So you must know that almost every good or service was significantly more expensive than is today. Eg. getting new car or apartment was both more expensive and lenghty struggle. Often against the government. And being member of communist party helped a lot which is really oppressive stuff considering you had to do nasty stuff while being in the party.

You must also know choice of goods and services was shitty as hell. Like one type of food. You couldn't choose a thing. Thus, if you wanted something, like shoes, you literally had one or two options. Yeah, you could go to special shop but goods there were even more expensive.

You were watched by government and every bad step you did could have meant loss of job or apartment. In the worst cases, you would go to jail for being anti-government. Censorship was harsh as hell. Nowadays tries to limit freedom of speech are pathetic compared to communist real practices.

When I compare life in communist era with today's capitalist, it is significantly better in both economical way and social way.

However, I am sorry your country went that way but looking at it backwards no side involved in your wars has clear hands. We had peaceful transition of power and **really** (I cannot stress how many times I would say **really**) everyone including the poorest has better life than during communist era. Communism was unsustainable economically (huge 90's crisis was inevitable but fall of communism happened, fortunately, earlier) but it was the biggest social experiment that destroyed lives of hundreds of millions people who weren't free to do what they wanted to do. Unfortunately, we still have to live with consequences of this inhumane experiment.

3143,"&gt; Spanish is the actual lingua franca, so if you use both of them indistinctively, it usually means that you're someone without feelings for one or the other whatsoever. 

I am sorry, but that is a very ludicrous not to mention an extremist thing to say, and I am putting it lightly. How in the world can you judge people's feelings for what they consider they belong to by the degree of language use in their daily lives? We are not even speaking about people who don't speak Catalan, but those who do but also speak Spanish.  

&gt; This is quite backed by the poll I linked to you in the other response, btw, with 30% of the Catalan citizens having only Catalan feelings, and 20% having more Catalan feelings than Spaniard ones.

I don't see how it is backed. Even though it might seem to make sense, it is only an assumption that this 50% is the same 50% which are pro independence, unless there is data correlating one with the other which I have not seen yet.

&gt; Don't you think this backs my point even more?

Unless you provide data which shows that language use correlates with sentiment with regards to independence, you are just using an assumption to correlate one data with another.

&gt; for people that *hate you*

Can you provide any data to back that extreme claim? 

Can you show concrete data on how Andalucians ***hated*** Catalans a decade ago when there was all this talk within pro-independist circles about supposedly *Catalan* money being *wasted* on Andalucian highways? 

Yes I know very well that when a people are told that *others* ***hate*** *you*, they will be politically incited. 

But where exactly was this incitement of hatred occurring? Hint: Doesn't seem to exactly have been outside of Catalonia. 

&gt; [€]

So that is where the Catalan vs Catalan citizen differentiation comes from? Ok.

But, I want to know something else, do those with the same ideologies as you support Brexit, or other such movements? After all the grievances are *exactly* the same (""We don't want *our* money to go to the poorer region of Europe"").

&gt;  La campaña “Registro de Residentes en el Exterior”, se desarrolló por el Departamento de Presidencia entre los meses de febrero y mayo de 2017 mediante anuncios animando al registro, imprescindible para el voto, en los que aparece la pregunta “¿si o no?” sobre un mapa de Cataluña. Los contratos asociados a esta campaña fueron concertados con  
&gt;  
&gt;  ESTUDI DADA SL (expediente PR-2017-130) que emitió factura por 10.829 euros por crear el anuncio.  UTE NOTHINGAD y KARDUMEN (expediente PR-2016/432), que emitió factura de 97.332,63 euros, por difundir el anuncio en Internet. 44 ABOGACÍA GENERAL DEL ESTADO MINISTERIO DE JUSTICIA   
&gt;  
&gt; FOCUS MEDIA S.L. (expediente PR-2016/426 que se corresponde con un contrato marco de cuantía muy superior), emitió una factura, por inserción publicitaria, de 158.344,41 euros. La prestación de los servicios a que se refieren estas facturas están certificados en su totalidad y reconocida la obligación de su pago, en tanto las facturas fueron certificadas como “conformes” por la Administración autonómica, aunque una parte al menos de su importe quedó sin abonar en virtud de la existencia de las Diligencias previas 118/2017 del Juzgado de Instrucción nº 13 de Barcelona. Las tres empresas reclaman el cobro y, al haberse prestado efectivamente los servicios descritos en las facturas, deberá la Generalitar afrontar el pago de éstos.

&gt;  Teresa Guix Requejo, autónoma que trabaja habitualmente para la Generalitat, cobró distintos trabajos, y en concreto, la suma de 2.700 euros por diseñar la página pactepelreferendum.cat, necesaria para inscribirse en el registro.   
&gt;  
&gt;En total por este concepto se abonaron 2.700 euros. Se comprometió el gasto de 10.829 + 97.332,63+ 158.334,41 = 266.496,04 euros. Se lesionó el patrimonio público por un total de 269.196,04 euros

However, here's the general consensus about its definition:
&gt; A common framework for interpreting populism is known as the ideational approach: this defines populism as an ideology which presents ""the people"" as a morally good force against ""the elite"", who are perceived as corrupt and self-serving. Populists differ in how ""the people"" are defined, but it can be based along class, ethnic, or national lines. Populists typically present ""the elite"" as comprising the political, economic, cultural, and media establishment, all of which are depicted as a homogenous entity and accused of placing the interests of other groups—such as foreign countries or immigrants—above the interests of ""the people""

Thus, Lega &amp; M5S are by all accounts a prime example of populist parties

3288,"A yahoo posted a set of ""rules"" that went viral on Facebook or something and that were titled ""The Purge"" and clearly inspired by the movie. This was detected by cops monitoring social medias and prompted a unusually large deployement of police forces accross the country. It was also widely reported by the medias, which fueld the viral part the initial lame ""joke"".

So we have a conjunction of multiple factors that led to the present report :

* endemic violence in the surburbs by disenfranchised youths

* Halloween night, that makes wearing a mask appear somewhat normal whereas still illegal in public space

* unusually large deployement of police that enabled arrests for acts of petty vandalism that otherwise would have been unpunished, such as setting fire to a rubbish bin, and nominally illegal activities that usually go unnoticed like detonating a cracker or launching party fireworks

* said unusual nationwide police operation led to the unusual nationwide consolidated police report

* usual media snowball

--------------------------------------

Now, a police inquiry is still ungoing, trials are pending, so it will be some time before we know if the initial ""Purge"" post was indeed a trigger. Then, some statistical acumen will be needed to see if *this* batch was indeed out of the ordinary disturbances. At any rate, to qualify *this* as ""riots"" is a gross exageration.

&gt; Bruno Verschuere, a senior lecturer in forensic psychology at the University of Amsterdam, told the Dutch newspaper De Volskrant that he believed the system would deliver unfair outcomes.
&gt; 
&gt; “Non-verbal signals, such as micro-expressions, really do not say anything about whether someone is lying or not,” he said. “This is the embodiment of everything that can go wrong with lie detection. There is no scientific foundation for the methods that are going to be used now.
&gt; 
&gt; “Once these systems are put into use, they will not go away. The public will only hear the success stories and not the stories about those who have been wrongly stopped.”
&gt; 
&gt; Verschuere said there was no evidence for the assumption that liars are stressed and that this translates to into fidgeting or subtle facial movements.
&gt; 
&gt; Bennett Kleinberg, an assistant professor in data science at University College London, said: “This can lead to the implementation of a pseudoscientific border control.”

Another problem with this is that the system is closed-source (of course) and there is no way for those affected by it to understand the decisions it makes. Systems such as these that make important decisions about our lives need to be open-source and rooted in scientific evidence.

that's a way of signaling that you think you are special when you are not, but even so you want to be, which is superficial and damaging to a society, it segregates you from the others in your mind, also all these thing can still be kept by choice, you can still choose to engage in all of them which is kinda the crux of a individual empowered society

Considering centrally directed economies are setting up almost every aspect of the economy is imo strongest evidence.

&gt;And your GDP is still shit when compared to west while receiving massive subsidies from west. Your competitiveness is even more shit when compared to commie China.

1. Your allegedly massive subsidies are drop in the ocean compared to GDP. Since 2004 we received subsidies in total value equaling 1/5 of Czech GDP for 2017. Simply said, every year we got subsidies in value of 1 % of GDP. Thus with subsidies, we would be able to fund about 1/6 of our health care system per year.
2. Comparing small Central European country with one of the biggest countries in the world isn't fait. And still we have much better GDP per capita (PPP) than China (35 000$ vs 16 000$)

&gt;What an absolute bs. Reality is that in some stuff they were better and in other worse. Your inability to see the obvious shows your bias.

Commie countries weren't significantly better in anything in comparison with the West. Our scientific ""power"" is pretty much struggling now. We could have been better but thanks to communists we weren't.

&gt;Those colonies got plundered dry. Inda alone went from 16% world GDP to mere 4% as a colony. And they were better off compared to some other colonies.

So you admit that Soviet Union was leaching Eastern European states? Cause Soviet Union was essentially, in your words, a huge colonial power.

Believe me, maintaining colonies far from home is far more costly (and in former colonies is rising support for getting back to old times cause foreigners dealt with main problems) than when you have your colonies in front of your nose. The Soviet Union (especially Russian part) literally drained the best from EE countries and never returned tons of favors back except by invading disobedient countries.

&gt;All but Germany were untouched when compared to eastern front.

Ok, fair enough. I would argue with UK that was as heavily bombed as Eastern front at one time.

&gt;Germany was a ""sick man of europe"" until end of 1990's. Still ""the commies"" were the powerblock that rivalled and even surpassed western countries.

Your logic is flawed cause if surpassing was true then how come that Eastern European countries including Russia aren't still on same level of quality of life? Hence, Eastern Bloc surpassed the West in literally nothing.

&gt;And now entire EU is getting trashed in competitiveness by China with only tariffs and protectionism helping us.

Trashed in competitiveness? EU GDP is 17277.70 billion US dollars in 2017. China GDP is 12237.70 billion US dollars in 2017. EU GDP per capita (PPP) is even higher than Czech. EU is clearly winning this race and protectionism isn't the way. You will see how USA economy will suffer cause Trump is starting economy war.

Imagine alternative history where Eastern Bloc is still living (and without potential super huge economy crisis in 90's that was actually inevitable and the collapse of communism prevented such crisis to happen), Czech (alternative history) economy would now in 2018 have been on level of Czech (actual history) economy in early 1990's. If you say we lost 30 years of growth due to collapse of Eastern Bloc, you are sadly absolutely mistaken. The opposite was truth. We lost 40 years of growth under communists and Western Europe had 40 years advantage that is thanks to capitalist mechanisms almost gone.

Please see [this](https://www.google.cz/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;hl=cs&amp;dl=cs#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:CZE&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=cs&amp;dl=cs&amp;ind=false) (in Czech, though) it is GDP of Czech Republic in between 1990 and 2017. You can clearly see we had strong and healthy economy that surpassed centrally directed economy in late 1990's.

3408,"PvdA is NOT conservative. Their program is one of the most progressive ones out there and furthermore nobody sees them as conservative. What does 'establishment' even mean?

The perception of the parties also matter. If you want to look purely at the program points then you'd have to consider PVV to be centrist, yet everyone sees them, logically, as far right. Same with CDA. They decidedly take a more nuanced approach to most issues, with their 'family values' as a leading principle. In recent years they have tried to fill the void on the right that was only filled by the VVD for many years, but that doesn't negate decades and decades of them being centrist. 

You are claiming facts over things that most people don't see. And that's kind of the crux of the mistake that you make. Just because the VVD doesn't take a more critical approach to the EU doesn't make their voters not critical of the EU. People in the Netherlands that are on the right are generally against the EU while the opposite is true for people on the left.

Not quite, some countries in Europe invested heavily in state-sponsored training courses, which tend to be mandatory while you're receiving state benefits, and often have a supplementary income that takes these people out of official unemployment counts.

Other types of underemployment increased exponentially as well. In the UK the infamous zero-hour contract in the last decade increased from 0.5% to 2.4% of the workforce. Coincidentally or not the employment rate during the same period is up by 3%.

Livonians being completely distinct group of people, much closer to Estonians and Finns then Latvians, had some influence on the new-born culture but in no way Livonians could be considered ""ancient Latvians"".

3530,"&gt; Part of eastern block. 

And still, Czech GDP chart isn't the same as Eastern European GDP chart. That's where your argument fails.

&gt; ""I dont like it so ill call it fake"" 

I said that GDP was artificially held on higher than an actual level due to being a part of a closed economic system. Czechoslovakia rarely traded with non-Eastern Bloc country. It wasn't fake in a meaning that government made up figures (even though there actually could be this practice pretty common in communist era). GDP wasn't on the actual level in meaning like when your friends and family would constantly tell you are the best singer, then you would go to American Idol or similar kind of show and you would be confronted with the reality that you are a shitty singer. That's basically how GDP in communist countries was artificially held too much up.

&gt; Your competitiveness was abysmal because your entire system has just collapsed. Its still abysmal when compared to lowly commie China. 

Actually no, it was abysmal cause we had in 1990 an economy that was literally and actually on a level of capitalist, Western economies of maybe 50's or 60's but we often had technologies that were really even older and we lacked the whole generation of quality managers. 

&gt; And yet the commies were at the forefront of many scientific and technological achievements 

Actually, that isn't quite right as well. Of course, there were fields where communist scientist kept up the pace with the Western world but communists countries really overall lost to their counterparts in the West regarding scientific research.

&gt; while starting from a feudal society and destroyed country 

That's horsesh\*t. 

1) Feudal society was pretty much gone in 19th century in Habsburg monarchy.

2) Czechoslovakia wasn't much touched by both world wars. Harsher was WWII where some bombing occured but the Great Depression was even harsher on our economy.

3) Czechoslovakia was advanced country since the beginning of its independence.

&gt; Compared to west that was either leaching from colonies for centuries or was completely untouched by war. 

4) Leaching from colonies is false marxist rhetoric. But I would say you like communism so it fits you well.

5) France, UK, Italy and Germany were all devasted by war so what do you mean by completely untouched by war?

In summary, you clearly have no idea what you are talking about but no wonder since you use marxist rhetorics and clearly sympathize with communism.

Unfortunately I do know what I am talking about. Yes the inactive people include a large number of other people. But how the benefit system is setup involves people who are unemployed looking for work not being counted in the unemployed section.

&gt; The ILO definition of unemployment covers people who are: out of work, want a job, have actively sought work in the previous four weeks and are available to start work within the next fortnight; or out of work and have accepted a job that they are waiting to start in the next fortnight.

And they get this information from the job seekers benefit.

Then there is a whole section of under employed which is not counted in this at all.

3605,"The context and scale is pretty gosh darn important if you're going to make the outrageous claim that this is an example of the Allies ""being worse"" than the Nazis were.

For instance, at this camp it seems that much of the hostility was driven by the one guy without the knowledge of his superiors. When it became impossible to hide the conditions at the place and he had to notify local authorities about it they soon acted against him, vaccinated the remaining people who had not succumbed to the epidemic and shut down the camp, releasing most of the surviving prisoners. The terrible conditions seem to have been driven by the vengeful nature of the one guy as he was claiming that his entire family had been killed by a Nazi-led police organization with the Nazi order in Poland.

This is obviously a bad place, but you see a response from the officials that something is not right there and they suspend its operation, most of the people go free (and many of these were people determined to be or to have been collaborating Nazis in getting the likes of the folks who were now in charge killed.) If they were however behaving exactly like Nazis, how would the response have differed?

The exceptional indifference and cruelty showed by this camp commander that contributed to 1855 dying was completely normal and expected on an institutional level by the Nazis for their camp commanders. This Zgoda camp is not so far from Auschwitz; there, such high figures in government as Himmler visited and oversaw demonstrations of the mass killings the facility was capable of, and gladly gave their seal of approval. Over one million were killed with the full-throated blessings of the Nazi state.

If the Allies had taken on this attitude and 'behaved exactly like Nazis', then why were there not such extermination camps on Germany after the war? Why weren't the whole of German lands emptied into such camps, gassed and killed with only a handful remaining to serve as slaves, as had been the intentions of the Nazis to inflict on the world? Why was there any restraint, despite the state the Nazis ran having committed evil against the Allied nations on a scale previously unknown in the world while the Nazis had let loose their fury on the flimsiest of pretexts? Why would people in such a camp as Zgoda ever be released instead of just killed?

This rhetoric about both sides acting the same diminishes the true evil of the Nazi state. It's true that people on the Allied side did terrible things born out of the anger and frustration from the murders, maiming and rapes of their family, the destruction and unspeakable misery that was inflicted on innocent people for no reason other than that Nazis thought themselves supermen above everyone else, but to put the conduct of the Allies on level with the Nazis or ""even worse"" as you put it is missing the forest for the trees.

Also, Poles and Czechs had plenty of reasons to be angry at Germans on their own without needing to take orders from the USSR.

That the UK is so multicultural with so little of the racial or other tensions seen elsewhere is great, Northern Ireland aside - and progress has been great and is ongoing there. Don't try to make me out as demonising it or any other nation, western or not. 

The reason the UK grew its empire as it did, like the Spanish, the Belgians and more was by committing atrocious acts in the process. Was it the worst? Hard to say, but it was one of them (along with the Spanish and Russians). The sheer scale of British empire operations makes it hard to contend by most nations on a global scale and *this alone* puts them on the nastier end of the 'rankings' when the methodologies of the time are considered. Over the last hundred years certainly the UK has not been the worst, not even with the genocides and breaking of war laws, as other nations and régimes have been far more vicious. Over the last 50 odd years in particular the UK been pretty good, at the forefront of many positive changes and current/recent events always feature in the forefront of people's thinking.

3755,"That's from [Jesse Owen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Owens)'s own words, because of his upbringing in segregated USA it seemed like they were more tolerant in Germany for some reason, when it only seemed that way as black people were just strange or exotic for the people there, few negative stereotypes and preconceptions had been developed of them as few had even seen them, outside of genuine Nazis looking at them as being savage animals, and during the war they sentenced of thousands of  French African colonial troops to death.

&gt;The long-jump victory is documented, along with many other 1936 events, in the 1938 film Olympia by Leni Riefenstahl. On August 1, 1936, Hitler shook hands with the German victors only and then left the stadium. International Olympic Committee president Henri de Baillet-Latour insisted that Hitler greet every medalist or none at all. Hitler opted for the latter and skipped all further medal presentations****

&gt;Later the same day, Owens's African-American team-mate Cornelius Johnson won gold in the high jump final (which began at 5:00 p.m.) with a new Olympic record of 2.03 meters.[28] Hitler did not publicly congratulate any of the medal winners this time; even so, the communist New York City newspaper the Daily Worker claimed Hitler received all the track winners except Johnson and left the stadium as a ""deliberate snub"" after watching Johnson's winning jump.[29] Hitler was subsequently accused of failing to acknowledge Owens (who won gold medals on August 3, 4 (two), and 8) or shake his hand. Owens responded to these claims at the time:

* Hitler had a certain time to come to the stadium and a certain time to leave. It happened he had to leave before the victory ceremony after the 100 meters [race began at 5:45 p.m.[30]]. But before he left I was on my way to a broadcast and passed near his box. He waved at me and I waved back. I think it was bad taste to criticize the 'man of the hour' in another country.[31][32]

&gt;an article dated August 4, 1936, the African-American newspaper editor Robert L. Vann describes witnessing Hitler ""salute"" Owens for having won gold in the 100m sprint (August 3):

*  And then ... wonder of wonders ... [sic] I saw Herr Adolph Hitler, salute this lad. I looked on with a heart which beat proudly as the lad who was crowned king of the 100 meters event, get an ovation the like of which I have never heard before. I saw Jesse Owens greeted by the Grand Chancellor of this country as a brilliant sun peeped out through the clouds. I saw a vast crowd of some 85,000 or 90,000 people stand up and cheer him to the echo.[33]

&gt;Albert Speer wrote that Hitler ""was highly annoyed by the series of triumphs by the marvelous colored American runner, Jesse Owens. People whose antecedents came from the jungle were primitive, Hitler said with a shrug; their physiques were stronger than those of civilized whites and hence should be excluded from future games.""[34]

&gt;For determining impacts these exposure indicators were carefully related to 19 sensitivity indicators. For example, heat sensitive population (persons older than 65 years living in densely built up areas of cities) were related to changes in the number of summer days (above 25°C), while forests sensitive to fire were related to changes in summer days and summer precipitation. The resulting individual impact indicators were then aggregated to determine the physical, environmental, economic, social, and cultural impacts of climate change. The overall impact was calculated using different weights for these impact dimensions, ranging from 0.1 for cultural impact to 0.31 for environmental impacts.  These weights were based on a Delphi survey of the ESPON Monitoring Committee members, which represent the European Commission, 27 European countries and four Partner States.

What I find interesting is that I cannot find the reasoning for the weights anywhere on their site, admittedly I may not be looking at the right places.

The following paragraph in the report states that this is just a study on how well certain regions can adapt and take advantage of new opportunities.  So it is basically a report not so much on climate change but on industrial, technical, and government productivity, ingenuity, and efficiency.

And in the final paragraph of their report, they state that this is not a forecast, but is an assessment confronted with uncertainty.",,/r/europe/comments/9tba6x/map_of_where_in_europe_climate_change_will_hit/e8vvtph/,SkinnyNerd,1541120321

3939,"&gt; Ditto New York to Nevada.

No. Not at all. You fundamentally *do not understand* how the US works. 

New York transfers nothing to Nevada. The US does not have fiscal transfers from state to state.

The US has uniform taxation across the US, provides more or less uniform benefits across the US. But people are taxed *individually* and receive benefits *individually*. 

In states with richer populations, more individuals are going to pay higher taxes, and fewer individuals are going to need benefits...so if you go to the trouble of aggregating all of the taxes paid by people who live in NY and compare that to all of the benefits they receive...and do that for all of the other states...you can identify some states as ""donors"" and some states as ""recipients"".

But that's not what's actually going on the way it does with Westminster and Scotland. If the New Yorker moved to Nevada, he would pay the same taxes; if the Nevadan moved to NY, he would receive the same benefit. 

There is never anything like ""Let's take this money from NY and give it to Nevada"". It all happens at the individual level. ",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9t7a1l/twentyfive_years_ago_the_union_was_born_alive_and/e8vnco0/,thewimsey,1541112601

3983,"&gt;In communism each person contributes and receives according to their ability and needs.

This is literally the only factually correct part of your post.

&gt;Such a system requires a governing body with immense power, so it would have the ability to take from everybody and give to everybody.

False, true communism doesn't require any governing body with such a power. And as a corollary, anyone who runs such a body and tells you it's communism is lying. Communism is a free, voluntary system without coercion of any kind. I'm not sure what system you're talking about, but it isn't communism.

&gt;We've seen it happen in every single Communist regime across the world. Communism has taken the lives of some 100+ million people.

As I've pointed out above, there can't possibly be such a thing as a ""communist regime"". It's a complete oxymoron. A government can't be communist since governments are oppressive and coercive by definition, and therefore, a communist society can't have a government. There is literally no way for what you've described to happen in an actual communist society. I think you may be confusing it with the actions of some states that merely claimed to be communist, with absolutely nothing to back that claim up of course.

4035,"There was a monetary union yes. Everyone used the dollar. The only period there wasn't was during the civil war when the south had their own currency (there may have also been a 3rd, not sure).

Banks issuing their own notes doesnt negate monetary union. Banks create money today from credit. They take a deposit (ie they borrow) from person A, keep 20% in reserve, and lend 80% to person B. Person B then saves that in another Bank. That bank does the same (keep 20%, lend 80%). This continues ad infinitum, so from the original deposit the banks have created much more money purely from the power of credit.

Where the central bank comes into this is as the lender of last resort if a commercial bank can't meed its obligations in a crisis. It also engages in QE which effectively entails depositing money with the commercial bank in exchange for bonds. The bank then uses that cash to lend out &amp; create money the same way it did with Person A. In this way the commercial banks create money, and it would have been no different in 19th Century USA. It would just have been real money they printed rather than electronic deposits.

4069,"&gt;I simply don’t believe it is a case that all Leavers are misinformed racists and that’s that.

The fact is that the effects of EU membership are exceedingly complex to judge. Most of the voters were not equipped  to make an informed judgement as to the benefits versus costs of EU membership, they were swayed by emotional campaigns, the wish to protest against the establishment etc. Even professional economists find it difficult to evaluate the effects of EU membership, Eurozone membership etc. in a precise and deterministic way.

This is exactly the reason why we have representative democracy, for MPs to make such difficult decisions that require time for analysis and access to qualified expert opinion. Unfortunately, MPs effectively recused themselves and allowed uninformed voters to make the decision with a very thin majority and only 37% of the electorate voting for such constitutional change. This was a bad idea, which Cameron only put into practice believing people would never be so stupid.

You are right that many reasons set the environment in which such a decision was made. You omit the fact that politicians had been blaming the EU for many of their own mistakes, this became a habit, and through the years developed into anti-EU sentiment. The UK is not unique in this.

However, taking into account the wafer-thin margin, we cannot discount the lies told during the campaign, the false promises, Russian meddling and actual illegal campaign financing. The effect of those could easily amount to the 2% difference, which makes the referendum results illegitimate.

In order to make such constitutional changes in a democracy, you really need to have a strong mandate of the people and 37% just cannot yield such a mandate. The problem is that the UK is so divided on the issue and whichever decision is made, a lot of people will suffer negative consequences. In a democracy, such changes are made with stronger margins, in order for them not to be overturned at a later date, as might well happen with Brexit.

The UK has already lost 2.1% in potential economic growth due to Brexit, and this is just the beginning ... Are you seriously trying to tell me that the majority of Leavers believed the economy will suffer, but wanted to do it anyways? I don't think so, I think most of them thought everything will only be better, certainly not worse.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/9t7is3/after_brexit_dilemma/e8v3v8b/,trisul-108,1541097179

4071,"&gt; However, there will be an uptick in their production because all else being equal, the price on said car and car parts would have fallen. A more indirect way the same thing happens is Portugal's car part suppliers would get new investment from Germany/France/wherever because the buyers (auto manufacturers) would expand production for better margins

No you're displaying your complete ignorance on the issue, once again, people, businesses, do not buy the cheapest car parts nor the cheapest cars and price is one factor among many, its not even close to being the main factor. You'll probably never understand that or choose not to because you're either ideological or just not very informed, or ever worked in a business with supply chains across borders or dealt with forex risk. So in your mind, everyone buys the cheapest product and the market is perfectly efficient and you discount all other factors, which are actually far more important. But whatever, you don't know what you're talking about. 

&gt; They are. Especially a global, durable product like steel. As long as the steel in question meets the standard of the intended use the cheaper will be chosen. The global glut of steel was problematic for this exact reason. Cheap Chinese steel was eating away at local production.

No, do you know what the word commoditised means? I don't think you do. Look it up. Not even commoditised products are purchased purely on price.

4185,"&gt;Europeans are generally less willing to mass murder each other

That is what I was replying to. It is, empirically, false. Recent history confirms, yes, the Europeans love killing each other.

Ever hear the story about Hiram Maxim? He was living in Europe, waiting for a non-compete to expire, looking for a project. One of his friends saud, ""If you want to make a pile of money, invent something that will enable these Europeans to cut each others' throats with greater facility."" He did, and they did, and Maxim ended up knighted by the Brits.

So, no. Europeans do not get to brag about how peaceful they are. Not until we have had more than 25 years without ethnic cleansing.

4197,"Sure but you got to remember that back in the 1970's when Aruba had their independence referendum(yes or no), the result was a whopping 95% PRO independence. The status aparte we have now, wasn't on the table back then. It was independence or nada. 

It was only due to a political masterclass by Betico Croes that the status we have even exists today, unique afaik in the world. Recently they bundled us up as overseas territories, but our status is unlike any of those other islands. 

We recieved the ""status aparte"" in 1986 after nearly 6 decades of struggle with the Dutch. Which was supposed to be a buffer between that year and the date for complete independence which was set for 1995. 

Betico knew that by the time the independence date would come around, both the Dutch and the Arubans would be content with the status quo because everyone got what they wanted. A clause was inserted into the agreement that the independence decision would be revisited before 1995. So, they did and the independence clause was put away but can be revisited anytime the Arubans feel like it. 

People who were closest to him say Betico knowingly did this knowing that after a decade of status aparte both Arubans and the Dutch would be willing to go forward with Aruba as an equal partner within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, together with the other countries, the Netherlands Antilles and the Netherlands. 

I left so much out, but due to all these circumstances, differences in public support, the long road Aruba had to travel, the uniqueness of our status, I highly doubt New Caledonia would be able to make the same arrangement.

4235,"&gt;Benelux, Germany and potentially France perhaps (even though they instigated it) and gradually expanded bit by bit once everybody was fully aligned.

Possibly. But even then you've got the problems of differing languages and cultures, which is key, as another important lever for easing the pressure in currency areas caused by region-specific economic shocks is migration.

In the US following the crash people moved en masse from Nevada to LA and NYC. In the UK, Scots and the Irish moved to London. 

Problem with the EU is that while there is migration, it is not as much and not enough to stem the problems of regional unemployment. And the main barriers to this are culture, language, and history.

It's far easier for a Nevadan to up sticks to LA than for a Greek to move to Germany. On top of the language and cultural issues you also have the fact that the US has only been around a couple hundred years and family anf friends are far more likely to be dispersed across the country. Comparatively, for a young Greek everyone he knows is likely to be in Greece, and so moving is thst much harder.

Then on top of thst you have the political implicaitons of migration in Europe - foreigners coming to take our jobs etc. Not as easy to be angry about that in the US as again they all speak the same language and see themselves first snd foremost as Americans.

So to conclude, yeh I agree the Benelux/northern countries probably had the best chance of making it work. But again only with fiscal and banking union, and even then you've still got the problems of migration, so would it have been worth it? Not for me - a free trading area was successful and would have been absolutely fine, and if Europe had ended up significantly converging over time the € could always have been done later and done properly (ie fiscal, banking, etc). Unfortunately the way it's been done, while ostensibly for good reasons, looks like it's pushing europe further and further apart, which is bad for us all.


&gt;rise of the AfD which seems to be much more driven by the migration crisis.

Agree this is driving factor. But from what I've read there is a monetary factor to it too. AfD are getting a fifth of the vote. But 20% of Germans arent racist. For many of them a key driver is thet they really don't want to be on the hook for Southern Europe and are wary of Europhiles like Macron pulling them into it. 

Many have bonds tied up in the PIIGS, they think they have been propping up the continent since the crisis, they have seen stagnant wages for the last 20 years, and they want to get paid - they dont want their hard earned wages going to what many of them see as 'the feckless Greeks' unconditionally and in perpetuity. 

For them, AfD would absolutely prevent any slide into federalism. Dsastrous migration policy and ongoing refugee rape/crime stories are just the icing on the cake for these people. ",,/r/europe/comments/9t7a1l/twentyfive_years_ago_the_union_was_born_alive_and/e8uw1uh/,hb8847,1541090944

4276,"The UK had an very special approach in getting soldiers to join the army compared to every other major power in WW1. While Germany, France, Russia had decades spend already to build up a well trained conscription army the UK still had a considerably small volunteer service army at the start of the war. They didnt changed that until multiple weeks into the war pretty much up until Gallipoli where the Common Wealth lost almost 300.000 men the brits did well with just throwing Australians, Canadians and Indian Servicemen against their enemy.

The way they tried to lure people into joining the war was so unique that it also makes sence that they had more young boys dying on the battle field than the other great powers. In late 1914 the British government founded the Order of the White feather with popular female english figures like prominent author Mrs Humphrey Wardand. What they did was they hired young beautiful patriotic british women all over the country to shame and embarass young men who where in the age to be a soldier for not wearing a uniform and for beeing a coward. 

In every town in the UK (and later on also in the Colonies) there where these women, mocking men for not enlistening. It worked well but also backfired because sometimes they would shame boys too young so that 15 and 16 years old tried to enlist and would lie about their age hight and weight just so they could become soldiers. It also backfired because a war not only needs soldiers but people who work in mines and factories and at home who got also shamed even though they did their duty. And it backfired because those women would shame veterans who came back home and who didnt wear a uniform. The british government where forced to make badges for people to wear that would show those women that they did they duty too, so workers and veterans wouldnt be publicly mocked.

The second strategie was to tell those young guys that, if they sign up with all they friends, they would assure them that they could serve in the same unit and fight side by side in the trenches so you had entire streets of small towns enlistening together, or sportsclubs or pubs. 

They only later found out that it might not be a good idear for a soldier seeing his childhood friend die right next to him in the trenches but it worked great for conscription.",North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany),/r/europe/comments/9t7xud/when_you_see_things_like_this_it_certainly_makes/e8umfsr/,Honhon_comics,1541082873

4293,"&gt; I keep hearing people talk about the inevitable crash thats coming and how bad its going to be. I'm not saying you, or others, are wrong... quite frankly I don't know enough to say whether its coming or not. But what makes you so sure? Sometimes it feels like its one of those things that if enough people say it then it must be true. 

Same here I don't have in-depth knowledge of economic and international trade/finances. I go by what I read/learn from credible sources knowledgeable on the topic. There are quite a few leading economists both independent and from credible news organisations who 'predicted/semi-predicted' the 2008 crash. However I always try to take it with a grain of salt and look at it objectively. 

&gt; If memory serves, in 2008 there were very few voices predicting the crash beforehand. I'm sure that in hindsight there were warning signs and people who saw it coming but nothing like this inevitable big crash that people keep predicting is coming soon. 

There were few prominent politicians and economists warning us about the sub-prime mortgages and risky unregulated lending.

&gt; I dunno, I have a feeling that the crash that is supposedly coming won't be as bad as people think. Partly because everyone seems to see it coming. Then again I'm not an economist... all I know is that they've often been wrong with their predictions so I'm not taking it as gospel.

The rest of the world had Hitler, Stalin, Mao and others that were all against the U.S. definition of free speech.

&amp;#x200B;

Laws that effect freedom of expression, even those that you think initially are to protect the weak, are invariably abused by the powerful, who are the least effected by them, to silence those who are weaker ultimately to the benefit of the powerful.

&amp;#x200B;

Not long ago in a University in Canada im sure i read a story about a teaching assistant being dragged into a disciplinary meeting for playing a clip of some professor discussing trans issues, they used/abused some new transgender law to justify persecuting this girl going as far as to lie that there had been complaints and comparing the guy in the clip to Hitler.

 **We will keep hold of the safeguards that protect us from the devolving of political discourse that you guys are obviously having.**

Or is it that you simply justify your racism and sexism in PC terms and attitudes?

I hear a lot of things said about ""cis white hetero males"" that would not be tolerated if they were said about any other group in both Canada and the US and typically from the parties of supposed tolerance. While in the US most conservatives hold those who are racist in contempt and want nothing to do with them.

I specifically commented on somebody calling the EU 'libertarian' with: 'Uh the EU is like the furthest thing from being libertarian.' The biggest point of the comment was to explain how the EU is not libertarian at all.

To which you replied: 'That is a giant pile of bullshit, another far right fantasy.'

If you wanted me to understand that it was purely about the left/right dichotomy, you should use quotes to get me to understand that. I thought: 'that is a giant pile of bullshit' related to me calling it the further thing from libertarian.

&gt; What you said was ""the left like it the right doesn't"", which is false. 

False. I said: ' People 'for' the EU are **generally** on the left and the people against the EU are **generally** on the right.' which seems pretty undeniably true, to me, but maybe your country's 'left' is different from my country's 'left'. In my country(Netherlands), left-wing parties are pro-EU and right-wing parties are anti-EU, generally speaking.

&gt;When she leaves her apartment, she covers herself. ""But the face remains free, I don't wear a niqab. **I wouldn't find that appropriate here. We're still in Germany.**""

So only because she is still in Germany, but she otherwise agrees with the niqab.

So only because you didn't want the confrontation with Mr Muller, not because you disagree with not shaking hands.

Having gained so much glory, he could bestow peace on Europe, and he has not done so. The spell is broken.’151 She noted that he repeated the last phrase several times.

Because they only organize these kind of protests when immigrants are or might be involved. When they do so, anti-immigrant rhetoric generally dominates, as happened in Freiburg when the leader held his speech.

Some people might be unwilling to leave their country and others might be ready to go through a brick wall to leave it. And as an Eastern European citizen I've seen many example of how easy it is for someone to leave for a completely foreign country. My best childhood-friend lives in Spain; my 1st cousin and her husband live in England, my godmother worked for 15 years in Greece while her children grew up here; another friend moved to live and work in England.

And it's not just me. Everybody I know can name at least 2-3 family members/friends that moved to the west.

4529,"I'm rationalist with some leftist leanings. For some more context, I'm currently studying national security and defence in a war academy. I base my opinions on facts and, if available, studies as well.

I'm not a very articulative person, my style is kind of fucked, probably that's why you didn't understand the main point I was tryng to make. It was that populism =/ facism, far-right =/ facism. You basically allign all of the right wing with facism and demolish the huge wall that seperates them. As I said before parites are moving away from facism since the 80s, when communism started to diminish.

Also, you don't seem to understand that the surge of populism was caused by the ""progressive"" left. They basically allowed everyone into Europe, it didn't matter if you're from Syria or Nigeria. That many people couldn't have been checked properly and you get these terror attack which propell populism even more. It's that ""sorry"" mentality, especially in former colonial empires and Germany, which led to this. All the money that Europe poured in Africa went into corrupt offical hands, it's their own fault.

&gt;Only when they already seized power. So your point seems to be that as long as they haven't taken over governments, we shouldn't worry, and when they did, we shouldn't fight it because it would create a power vacuum?

No, that's not my point. Whenever we beat one ""alternative"" party down, another pops up, and at many times it is worse than the former one. There will always be radical people so let them have their little thing. Only when the threat is imminent we should push them underground (WW2 rip facism, cold war rip communism)

&gt;They're already sending 2 soldiers to the border for every refugee that tries to cross it. People are being rounded up because they look Hispanic despite being full US citizens. There's concentration camps already (note; those are different than extermination camps!) and they 'lost' 1500 kids in them.

That's simply false. Did you mix it up with Japnese internment camps during WW2, they were built by a democratic government.

&gt; fascists were monsters anyway so now we think humans aren't capable of supporting fascism. It confuses the centrists when actual human beings start supporting fascism again.

Again I didn't say this. Some people will always be radical beacause there's always something they don't like. And the spooky thing about facists is that they are humans, not monsters.

&gt;It seems like we completely disagree here. This view is often based on having no idea what the ideology of anarchism is and just thinking it's wanting chaos, and thinking any form of communism has to be like some of the state capitalist or genocidal regimes that called themselves communist in the past, but in no way worked towards abolishing the state or money, and replaced the bourgeoisie instead of trying to make society classless. Or thinking 'communism is when the government does stuff' or 'under communism everyone has to be exactly the same'. The base principles of communism however, stand for creating a society where people are free. And as automation becomes commonplace, putting the fundamentals of capitalism under pressure, we need something that ensures that people can have housing, health care and food without having a paid job. UBI is just a last ditch attempt to prevent capitalism from decaying and creating a corporatocracy with a smile, because fascism is capitalism in decay. The final defense mechanism for corporate interests and the bourgeoisie by turning the proletariat on itself, blaming some perceived threat (often among ethnic lines) instead of the system.

I personally hate communism and neo-communists beacause I dealt with them before. Let me just tell you this, it is impossible to create an equall society because: 

a) there will always be people who disagree

b) The economy will stagnate beacause equality and state-regulated production is really, really inefficent

c) There will be no improvement beacause there will be no competition.

d) classless society doesn't work beacause there will always be smarter and stupider people.


You also seem to not know that we are moving to different job markets with automation. The physical work is becoming less and less, but the intelligence based service market is booming. People will adapt, as they always do.

make you feel proud, 
protect your house, 
give you a job, 
clean up the neighbourhood, 
remind you of how great you once were, 
clear out the venal and the corrupt, 
remove anything you feel is unlike you...

Also:

4730,"There are many more peoples peoples who would protest if the circumstances were better.

If you go to a protest as a concerned citizen in Germany you might:

* be filmed by media and leftwing organisations and portrayed as nazis
* some lefties might even go for your employer getting you fired because of your politics its their new move
* be beaten up by Antifa
* have to stand next to ""real"" neo-nazis and skins because they also go there and that can't be prevented so in the end you might be on a photo where someone next to you does a hitler salute

Because of these circumstances most conservative activism takes different forms its hard to get peoples to public protests if the curcumstances aren't better. There are some exceptions especially in the eastern part where peoples have less to loose and are fed up more. Of course there can always be another tipping point in the future where you get bigger mobilizations. But many conservatives who have much to loose like to keep their head down and go on with their lives. And sometimes its smart to do that instead of being grinded to pieces by the German leftwing media and institutions supporting them.

&gt;Half of the parcels of land slotted for the grant scheme consists of agricultural land owned by the state and not usable for other purposes and the other half of abandoned or uncultivated areas in southern Italy.

&gt;Coldiretti, a leading farmer organisation representing half a million farmers, estimates that the agricultural land owned by the state covers half a million hectares out of almost 13 million hectares of surface area used in Italy.“These are fertile lands, even of large dimensions, but most of the time they are under-utilised because they lack an entrepreneurial management capable of enhancing them adequately,” Coldiretti said.

According to Coldiretti, giving these lands to farmers would remove from the state the burden to cultivate the land, but above all, it would have the advantage of responding to the demand of the new generations, for whom the lack of availability of land to cultivate is the main obstacle to entering the sector.

Was built using republicans prisoners wich were ""hired"" from the state by construction companies wich supposedly had to pay their families and never did, so they were slaves. Many of them died building it, starving, illness etc. and were ""buried"" inside the walls with others brought from massgraves from many parts of Spain. 

But as franco wanted it to be a ""neutral"" ground and present it as a monument to all the dead in the war, he ordered to bury dead from his side too so it can be called Valle de los Caídos. In total there are about 34000 bodies buried inside, most of them republicans, being the biggest massgrave in Spain.

Also as Catholic church were with fascist side during the war and became a structural part of the dictatorship it was built as a basilic with an abbey behind the mountain.

When he was buried there it became a pilgrimage place for all the fascists in Spain.

The Republicans appealed to the Democratic powers first. France, U.K, U.S.A, anyone. They weren't wholly Communists - the Communists, Socialists, and Anarchists were a FACTION of the Republicans, which included Liberals and Social Democrats, and there was plenty of infighting.

You know why the Republicans turned to the U.S.S.R in the end? Because France and the U.K and the U.S.A were too spineless officially to help intervene and stop a war in Europe. Unofficially France was about to jump in and many foreign nationals lent aid, materiel, specie and bodies to the war but that's not enough against the militaries of two Fascist states trying out new doctrines and materiel. If the Democratic nations at least did something better than nothing, the Liberals and Social Democrats could had had the war in the bag. If France outright intervened, then that would had been the model the Republic would had followed.

The U.S.S.R (and Mexico, IIRC) were the only ones who decided they were far away enough and ballsy enough to do something about it.

There is no natural border there, it only became a political border when the republic seceded in 1922 while Northern Ireland didn't, which caused all sorts of trouble including them suddenly having to secure and enforce 500km of international borders through an area that had had no such thing before. Later on there were also The Troubles, which had to do with whether Northern Ireland should be part of Great Britain and thus split Ireland, or stick with the rest of Ireland but have to leave Great Britain then. (among many other things, The Troubles seem a culmination of all kinds of historical conflicts that had been brewing for a while...) 

But within the EU there was free border crossing, so nobody had to secure that border or enforce it recently, and since 2005 at least it has been practically invisible like many borders within the EU.

With Brexit, unless some kind of deal can be reached, it would go back to being an international border, having to be secured and patrolled, with passport and customs checks and military presence and all that. 

Depending on where you're from you might not imagine this, but these borders as they are really mean that you pump your gas or buy your bread down the street and actually *across the border* right now without much noticing that there is supposedly a border in the way.

5030,"I have no clue what distinction you're attempting to make, it is the way that the Nazis behaved that got them their infamous reputation. If one kid battered another with a hammer out of the blue and the other then slapped him, would you call them both equally bad behaving because they both struck each other? It totally ignores the scale of the events and their context. Not only that, you originally said that the Allies behaved not only ""the same"" but ""even worse"" sometimes, which is ridiculous.

Mass killing? There is no contest, not even with what Soviets did. If you take just the small country of Belarus as an example, they have a memorial there at Khatyn where they have a cemetery. It is not one of people; it is one of villages, a grave for every village that Nazis burned with all its people. There are nearly 200 graves.

But you will notice the specific language about 'all of its people', as this is only a small fraction of the ones that were destroyed. Many more were burned down yet managed to have at least one survivors, over 5000 settlements were put to the flame. Belarus lost a full quarter of its prewar population to Nazi killings, a couple million people. This is not necessarily super well known as Belarus was not perhaps the most developed area and there is not much video taken from what the Nazis termed 'anti-partisan operations', but you may more easily visualize what sort of hell those village people suffered in [this scene](https://vimeo.com/80267729) of a movie called Come and See. This was all in such a small area of the great expanse that the Nazis occupied in Europe!

It's true that the Allies did build concentration camps for the purpose of holding disarmed German soldiers captive until they were sorted out. However, it's a bit misleading- the common idea of the word concentration camp is mixed in with that of the special Nazi twist of extermination camps, which were basically death factories. The Allies did not use them in that respect, and while conditions weren't always great (naturally the food production and distribution systems of a bombed out, war torn Europe were *not great* and between the choices of feeding your own citizens the guys who had been trying to kill you until extremely recently the latter would get something of a short stick) the deaths are minimal compared to those operated by the Nazis and their collaborators. After the war and when the logistics had improved, massive quantities of food were delivered to occupied parts of Germany to avert starvation; compare this to the Nazi policies of directing food away to support themselves, which was called the Hunger Plan and aimed to kill 2 birds (and 20-30 million 'excess population'...) with one stone in occupied territories. As Hermann Goering once mentioned, ""I could not care less when you say that people under your administration are dying of hunger. Let them perish so long as no German starves.""

As to killing innocent people based on ethnicity, well, no surprise, the Nazis take the cake on that one. Hyped up by the lie that they were supermen, masters of the world, they aimed to set themselves atop the world on the land of others, slaughtering millions out of the belief that they were inferior and did not deserve the land that they had. It is true that some Germans were killed after the fact by enraged people from the countries that had been occupied, and sometimes the Germans who were killed actually were not fifth columnists nor invaders but people who had not done anything wrong, but the body counts of innocent people do not begin to compare between the sides.",,/r/europe/comments/9sn9ef/slovakia_today_celebrates_100_year_anniversary_of/e8toq6p/,sparkling_uranium,1541034703

5081,"I don't think it's nearly as bad as Sweden, Germany and England. In short we have a ton of oil money and good welfare pay that should mean that nobody feels the need to do gangcrime and burn cars.

Yet we do have organized crime and burning cars now and then. There are regularly cases of assault style and gang rapes and some areas experience quite a lot of ""white flight"" as a result of social deterioration. This has been pointed out for over 20 years and now we see certain suburbs of the capital devolving towards ghetto states.

We are told that everything is fine, but the Oslo police now dismiss the majority of criminal cases due to lack of resources and after 2011 they changed their policy to play down assault style rapes in the media. They also kept quiet about two guys shooting it out in attempted murder in the middle of Oslo in the middle of the day. Don't want to cause stigmatization right?

How come the police in ""the worlds richest country"" can't afford to do their job anymore? They dismissed 55k out of 84k cases in a year, 3300 of the dismissed cases had a known culprit.

These days reporting a crime is done more out of insurance needs than any hope to bring justice.

5158,"&gt; BS. As I said, Hungary might be offered / pressured in such a way, that they will agree to kicking us out. If not, they will be somehow bypassed. If not, we will just be delegated to ""2-tier EU"" which in reality will be like leaving EU. Politics is not physics or mathematics with strict laws. It flows constantly. History shows this quite clearly.

Yes, in theory they could be offered something so beneficial that they would do this, but thats purely theoretical. Nothing that the EU would be willing to offer would be worth it for Hungary. Believe in alternate universes, where everything is possible,all you want, Ill remain in this one. Its not going to happen.

&gt; Well, if you don't see what those potential benefits would be, that's your lack of knowledge and your problem. You could read more about economics. But you don't have to. You could also use logic: if EU integration during 60 years of it's history already brought economic prosperity, then perhaps more if integration would bring more prosperity? What do you think? Well, I am sure that you will now try to prove that prosperity without the EU would be better hahaha

Its so obvious and you are so well read, yet you couldnt give a single example, surprising that aint it? Pathetic, accusing me of lack of economic knowledge when you spout such bs. ""further integration"" while losing a relatively large/important country with more to follow.

&gt; Again, your lack of knowledge on economics shows. 1. The markets for companies increase: there are more jobs for Joes (although there are more Joes competing as well - true). 2. Joes get access to more products at better prices - their buying power increases, Joes get more stuff. 3. Joes get more access to more services at better prices. 4. Integration brings more efficiency and competitiveness - more choice, better prices for Joes (although they also have to compete more).

Again, you have no idea what you are talking about. 1. Have you heard of automation and scaling?  Companies moving factories abroad? Please be honest, do you really think a British builder, plumber, etc. isbetter off when there are thousands of people that are willing to (or even happy to) work for a wage that, they simply wouldnt be able to live off? 2. No Joe doesnt get more stuff because Joe doesnt have a job or his wages stay the same for years. Access to more stuff? Do you think Polish companies in general are able rival with German, French, British ones in their own countries? Dont be naive. 3. Not really, just because a company has cheap labor doesnt mean they will lower their prices. Even when that does happen, its rare and comes at a high cost (low wages). Your 4th point is basically a sum of the earlier ones which Ive shown arent really true. But you wont believe me so I suggest you actually go and ask a couple average Joes.

&gt;I  know that maybe you would say, that it is better to stand still - no competition. You know, keep them coal mines open, etc. But that's the stupidest thing to do. If you stand still, you lose. Economy should be in a process of constant ""creative destruction"" (Schumpeter) and only this way there is progress. There are always winners and losers.

Dont put words in my mouth. Its not better to stand still but ""competition"" on unfair rules (average joe ""competing"" with cheap labor from other countries, small companies ""competing"" with giants) doesnt move things forward, simply because they are not actually able to compete, one side has too much of an advantage. Sure, there are exceptions, but they are just that - exceptions.

&gt; We are being ripped of by the rich - that's true. 

Well, we are, but that really wasnt my point. My point is that while WE countries in general benefited from EU expansion, the average Joe didnt necessarily. What I described above is a big reason for Brexit, not because they are racist, but because Bob the builder or Paul the plumber simply are worse off.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/9sx2l2/polish_parliamentary_polling_2627_october_2018/e8tgceh/,Polish_Panda,1541026299

And when the police has a far more hierarchial structure in the UK then in the rest of Europe, you can see the issue - investigations don't get done because if you want to do it despite the 'no' of a higher-up, either your funds get pulled or you yourself get fired or delegated to an far-away desk job.

**3)** *Compared to a native who is going to be an economic drain for society for at least 20-ish years, most (if not all) immigrants will be productive members of society way before that.*

Then immigration is the only logical and reasonable way for us westerners to maintain our lifestyle. Sure, you can argue that this is unsustainable, but the problem is not immigration, it's our current economic system.

The only way to really stop us from heading straight unto a worldwide climate disaster is to reevaluate the basic core tenets of capitalism to ensure that profit does not trump ecological stability.

5246,"&gt;For some Europeans, the fact that the Polish crisis has reached this point constitutes proof that the country should never have been allowed to join the EU in the first place. 

*cough*

Who says that? What illiterate idiot would say such a ludicrous thing?

*cough*

&gt;This is deeply unfair – Poland should be judged on the achievements of the last 30 years, not the events of the last three.

Poland seemed to be moving in the right direction for a long time. Had they continued that progress, they could have been on par with some Western European countries by now. 

But then, just like some other countries, all of a sudden, they decided to move [the other way](https://infographics.economist.com/2018/DemocracyIndex/) again.

I honestly just don't get it, especially since they made loads of progress in many other territories, not in the last place economically.

&gt;But it does serve as a reminder that it was never Poland’s “destiny” to be so deeply embedded in the west.

Meh, I beg to differ. It's not up to me to claim whether it's their ""destiny"" or not, that's something for Poles to decide, but I do think they belong more in the West (as in [Western world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world)) than anywhere else.

Yes, we shouldn't judge them by the last 3 years (and yes, that's coming from me), but Poland itself has a responsibility here as well; they can't move much further towards authoritarianism anymore (or deny doing so). They're still considered a (flawed) democracy, but the trend is clearly going downwards towards the status of 'hybrid regime' (or '[illiberal democracy](https://freedomhouse.org/report/modern-authoritarianism-illiberal-democracies)'). But those darn' [EU Values](https://europarlamentti.info/en/values-and-objectives/values/) are here for a reason; they're the epitome of Western civilization.

Asking now to force people into working, even if they don't want to do or cut off the money to force them to work is something people have asked, but if you do it you are a Nazi.
Even considering that there is a problem with specific groups makes you a Nazi

So if there is no problem (as only Nazis think there is one, and  you don't want to be one) you don't need a solution.

5307,"&gt;Not everyone born in Ireland drinks a lot so why should I be forced to do so?

Not everyone agrees that the local law and constitution is valuable. Why should they be forced to adhere with them nonetheless? 

Because thats how societies work. People getting together and saying ""Ok, this is how it works **for us**!"". And sticking to it, even if individuals don't like it. Even using force to uphold those rules.

This is a classical individuals versus collectives problem. 

You can very well say individuals are the important element and that fuzzy ""culture"" can go fuck itself. Downside is every group is going to fall apart without social cohesion, meaning you live in a shithole country sooner or later.

I'd prefer the group saying ""fuck you!"" to the individual, hopefully creating something bigger and better together than what individuals can build by themselves.

Yes, it's arbitrary and pretty random. Yeah, you can very much disagree with that and often it is just fine for everyone. 

Ultimately society dictates the rules, no matter how silly and arbitrary it might be. If they expect you to drink, you have to drink or you are not part of that society. If they don't want you to not be part of society and not be there, that is how it goes. Deal with it.

And no, asking questions of ""Why do I have to do X and not Y"" doesn't get you out of this system. Nobody can explain culture. That's not how culture works. 

What you ask here is ""Why do I have to take part in your culture if I don't want to?"". The reason is: Because you implicitly agreed to join that club, with that culture, when you moved there. 

Using racism here is absurd because that system also works inside a country. As a rural guy in England how they live and compare that to some london snob dude. They will very much disagree with how to live together. I'm pretty sure both will say the natives lifestyle is the right one and the guest has to cater to that culture.

5407,"The thing about these kinds of networks is that once they've started, they start picking up new clients and are forced meet demand of their growing client base and things can quickly get out of hand if nobody stops it. One guy start grooming one girl for himself, gets a friend in on the action for the next, they start renting the two girls out to a third friend who sends over a forth and fifth and those guys ask for new girls. Nobody rats each other out because they are all related or share close social connections. The entire thing just snowballs and eventually everyone who might solicit the service of a prostitute simply uses these grooming gangs simply because they are the biggest game in town and the easiest to get a hold of.

The thing is that this went on for 14 years while the the police and local government **DELIBERATELY** turned a blind eye because of fear of political backlash. As in, girls literally escaped, went to the police or social workers and other government officials, told them what was happening to them, and just got told they were making it all up. People in government simply didn't take action because they didn't want to face the political backlash associated with cracking down on the local south asian community. Plenty of people got reports from multiple girls and realized that it couldn't be lies, but were stopped by higher ups. 

This allowed the gang to grow completely unhindered for over a decade. The people involved simply learned that they were literally above the law and could make as much money as they wanted while any growing competition was taken out by the local police.

The really scary thing is just how common forced prostitution actually is and how many girls end up getting forced into these kinds of situations. This is by no means an isolated case nor one that is unique to the south asian community.

This means that for any normal government public services and infrastructure needs to be sustainable. This clearly hasn't happened. And instead of blaming several failed governments, and making sure incompetence is voted out, the UK actually blamed the people coming here and the European Union (UKIP first, other parties after it), and the masses swallowed it, just in order to save the NHS (let's for the sake of the argument say it wasn't a racist or nationalist vote). 
 
Also every country has immigration and social impacts, you can't lock yourself out of the world and build walls, no country is self sustainable. So you need governments which are competent, which are addressing social and economic impacts and are addressing them with legislation and budgets, and not closing borders.
 
Immigration will not stop (never has, so I don't see why it should now), NHS will not magically get better. Brexit didn't bring no extra funds, hell probably loads of Welsh and NI farmers will be a lot worse off due to losing EU funds as the UK won't be able to fill the gap.

It doesn't matter what position is the EU in because it will have to deal with any consequences and any kind of deal or non-deal that will come up. EU is very much open to negotiating, it's just that UK has nothing much to negotiate about if it can't even agree what is it they want.

Basically UK is leaving on a set date, no matter what position is the EU in or UK in. EU prepares for that because it has to, prepares for this deal and that deal and most importantly no deal from the very beginning.

EU job is to make Brexit as easy as it can be to me and my fellow EU members. They had ample ways to make that happen.

Reach for example a 10-20 year deal with UK where brexit will be smoothed out over time to impact minimally people. In this case UK would still be part of EU for a while but as years will progress parts of their membership would be slowly removed until they would be completely out of EU rules and regulations.

This would also mean that people living there would have time to adjust, prepare in time.

Right now we have situation in which from day to day everything will completely change.

5540,"\&gt; Depends. Part of the migration pact is to include migrants into social security systems. So, you might be jobless and receive money from the state ....and then send it home ASAP.

I don't think the premise is right here. 

There is two options:

\- You have been accepted because of humanitarian reasons

=&gt; The payouts should not exceed what is absolutely required to live, and therefor you shouldn't have enough to send back home.

\- You came in because of a legal (work) program

=&gt; The people who are accepted under this scheme should have a low likelihood of being unemployed for a long time (else the visa should've been refused); making the whole situation unlikely

=&gt; The payouts should match the contributions made by the benefactor (and therefor, the state should still come ahead)

5604,"So immigration is falling in answer to your last point.  It seems to be accepted that the country is not willing to accept such huge numbers each year.

Regarding being pro Eu and the level of pro Eu well that’s different.  The U.K. has a different outlook in many respects to some in the Eu.

That has both hindered and helped the Eu.  The U.K. has always been liberal economic counter weight to some others in the Eu like France.  Much of the way the Eu works is because of the U.K.  

The U.K. has contributed much to the Eu and not just in terms of money or security.

I voted to remain so you could say I’m pro Eu but actually I don’t like many of the policies of the Eu. Closer political and military integration for example.

Does that make me less pro Eu or does it mean I have a different pro Eu vision.

Regarding labour open door policy, yep they certainly did.  Look at the net immigration over the last couple of decades.

Vote leave said that it was easier for a non skilled person from the Eu to get into the country than a doctor from the common wealth.  So things have tighten up but as I said take a look at immigration numbers.  

BBC from my perspective is pro Eu.

Both Popovici and Franz Ferdinant proposal of USGA were to prevent fall of monarchy which at that time was by intellectuals seen as inevitable without major structural reform. But where did it got animosity from? Right, the Budapest which was all too happy with 1868 compromise. That is until 1918 when in quick scramble, miraculously Budapest completely reverted its position and immediately offered Slovakia far-reaching autonomy as part of federal Hungarian kingdom and its own federal entity. After it Habsburgs capitulated and there was utterly no point in it anymore.

Ask yourself this. If Czechoslovak national council managed to recruit 100 thousand POWs into their army on three fronts, motivated to the point that those in Russia decided to fight their way across entire Russian Siberia and Far East, while Romanians were defecting en masse to royal Romanian army, while Bosnia was completely in flames, what do you think that popularity of A-H was? What would be your proposal aside of martial law and full-on massacres in time when Russian Empire was falling on its own head, only to be devoured by Lenin army and revolts in Poland , Ukraine and Baltics? While the royal economy was lagging heavily behind Western European counter-parts, not even able to rely on colonies like them?

&gt; Well, you are correct but that doesn't make it fairer :')

I'd put it in the same basket as social healthcare. It's insurance by design and there's no ""fair"" payout. It's insurance against ""what if"" that can happen. There's a wee bit that we can control and a lot that we have no say in.

Which is why I kinda like Denmark's private non-employment insurance. It removes a lot of abstraction and makes insurance truly insurance. You and your union fellows pay in, whoever is not unlucky gets the bank.

&gt; &gt; They don't feel they're getting their fair share back for massive taxes. How can we make them feel like their taxes worth to pay?

&gt; I feel like they just want more money and would rather pay no taxes at all, irregardless of what it gives them

It's complicated. E.g pension funds are one of the biggest investors. They push companies to save on taxes to have bigger payout for their customers. Frequently it includes wealth transfers from one country to another. E.g. US company avoiding taxes for better payout for Canadian pension fund customers. It's definitely fair for the Canadian pensioner. Since companies have to work to maximise stock returns... Which is kinda fair too. Why would a company take investors' money and then blow it away?

As for rich individuals, personally I'm not a big fan of progressive taxes with super high upper bracket. I'm all for not taxing the poor, but taxing rich even more because they already pay a lot... I can easily see why they'd feel it's not fair. And as a result, they pay even less taxes.

Middle class ends up paying the biggest portion of income taxes anyway. Just because there're so few super rich people. It's pretty much schadenfreude tax to show off for the poor.",Lietuva,/r/europe/comments/9sq5bi/emmanuel_macrons_government_will_soon_present_a/e8s9p17/,mantasm_lt,1540990073

5824,"&gt; Alessadro Proietti, a 40-year-old chef making some fresh pumpkin ravioli in the Testaccio market in Rome, says just hearing the term “the spread” starts to make him nervous about the economy.
&gt; 
&gt; For bond traders “the spread”, meaning the rate the Italian government pays to borrow above Germany, is simply a measure on any given day of how much riskier markets view lending to Rome than Berlin. But for Italy’s populist coalition government, which is locked in a stand-off with Brussels over its public spending plans, the term “lo spread” has been taken up as a symbol of a hostile external force that are trying to meddle.
&gt; 
&gt; Europe’s last sovereign debt crisis thrust previously arcane bond market terminology from the business pages into the centre of political debate across the continent. As the country’s borrowing costs climb, Italians are once again watching their politicians debate the behaviour of bond markets on a daily basis, noticing “lo spread” appearing on the front pages of newspapers and seeing it passionately debated on talk shows for the first time since Silvio Berlusconi was forced from office in 2011.
&gt; 
&gt; “People hear it and think: ‘OK, the economic crisis is back, there is no money. I have to save and stop wasting my money,” says Mr Proietti. “As soon as people hear the word spread, they get anxious and tend to pull in the oars and stop spending”.
&gt; 
&gt; Matteo Salvini, leader of the hard-right League party which shares power in the coalition, has regularly invoked the idea of “the lords of the spread” as trying to boss the government around. “Should I change my policies… on the basis of what some speculators decide in the morning?,” he asked this week. “No”.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It is echoed by Luigi Di Maio, the 32-year-old leader of the Five Star Movement, the largest party in the coalition. “Our objective is not the spread but the citizen,” said , this week. “The story of the spread… is a way to terrorise citizens”.
&gt; 
&gt; And some are anxious. “Lo spread. What is the spread?,” asks Anna Ferretti, a 90-year-old in the middle of buying some flowers. “If something goes up, something else has to go down. And I know that when the spread is the one thing that goes up, then my wallet is the thing going down”.
&gt; 
&gt; Raffale Oriani, professor of advanced corporate finance at LUISS in Rome, says that while few Italians will be familiar with the technical aspects of sovereign debt markets the reappearance of ‘lo spread’ will make people more aware of the economy, meaning this heightened awareness can feed directly back into their views about the government.
&gt; 
&gt; “’The spread’ has become part of everyday language again,” says Prof Oriani. “Most people do not have a precise idea of what the spread is from a technical point of view. I think people perceive it in more general terms — when it goes up, something is going wrong with the country”.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The European Commission has said Rome’s plans to run a sharply higher budget deficit next year to fund the government’s spending plans risk breaking its rules, and must review them later this month. Brussels must tread carefully, knowing that Mr Di Maio and Mr Salvini are unlikely to back down from a fight. Some figures in the Commission believe that it would be better to leave financial markets to impose “discipline” rather than European politicians.
&gt; 
&gt; So far, although little time has passed since they announced their spending plans, there have been few signs that Mr Di Maio and Mr Salvini’s popularity is suffering from their confrontation with Brussels and the bond markets. Recent polls have shown Mr Salvini’s anti-migration League has surged ahead of Five Star, which itself is still polling far ahead of other parties.
&gt; 
&gt; For many Italians the noise of the markets is far too detached from daily reality to influence their thinking. “The real economy is far from the economy of the spread, the economy of the Bundesbank, of Merkel and Draghi,” says Vito Vivanti, who runs a cafe in central Rome. “The real economy is made of piadinas, artichokes and bills to pay at the end of the month”.
&gt; 
&gt; Others are willing to wait and see. Luigi Gallucci, a 72-year-old mechanic who voted for Five Star, says he doesn’t really care about the spread. “It doesn’t have anything to do with my everyday life,” he says as he’s trying to fix an old Fiat Panda. “I think that Italy is taking a positive road. Now we have to wait to see the first results of what [the government] is doing. We’ve dragged a huge debt behind us for so many years… I don’t see how now Italy can be wiped out overnight.”

Every person has the right to apply for asylum, not everyone will obtain it. Therefore not every migrant is, in the end, legally allowed to stay in Germany based on the right to asylum.

It is perfectly consistent to be in favour of strict migration controls but allow for the right to asylum. Asylum ""merely"" becomes one way to migrate legally, and this particular path is severely limited as well: not everyone can *obtain* asylum, even if everyone can ask for it. Once those who can obtain asylum legally are excluded, the remaining paths for legal migration are equally controlled (in principle).

&gt; What would the social contract be with art. inseminated single mothers? I choose super-sperm from a catalog while single men pay for it all?

&gt; Who pays for pensions?  
&gt;  
&gt;Future pension recipients. 

The single mother's children aren't suddenly exempt from paying taxes, so even if like you believe suddenly every woman decides to drop men alltogether and have a single child, those children would help pay for it.

Besides, the single mothers work and pay taxes too, there's no reason to assume these would all stay at home.

&gt; What's in it for the men?
