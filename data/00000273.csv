76,"Okay, some issues I have with this 'research'

- the current Muslim population is overstated. The current Muslim population in the Netherlands is 4.9% and that number was 4.5% in 2010. Somehow, Pew made it 7.1% and somehow they managed to make it increase (a lot) over the past years. I trust the national statistics bureau rather than Pew in this case (source: 

- remigration isn't counted: over half of migrants in Europe go back in a few years, e.g. students, workers. Even second generation migrants are quite likely to go live in their parents' country of birth. The number of Turks migrating to Turkey from the Netherlands is higher then vice versa. For Moroccans, this will also soon be the case. 

- there won't be another refugee crisis like in 2015 and it's wrong to make assumptions for the next 35 years based on refugee migration from 2014-2016, which were peak years. Next to that, there is now sufficient infrastructure and political experience on how to deal with such a crisis. It won't happen again. 

- this research assumes that the amount of people converting from Islam will remain stable. I think that third generation muslims and especially those with one native parent will be more likely to become atheist. About a third of third-generation children from Moroccan and Turkish immigrants have at least one Dutch parent. If this trend continues, by the end of this century most current Muslims in the Netherlands will have 1/2, 3/4 or 7/8 Dutch ancestry.  Will those people be just as likely to stay Muslim?

- migrants from Muslim countries are more likely to be non-Muslim. Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrarians.. are better-represented among migrants than muslims relatively. This survey only counts it for the countries in combination with country of origin where research into it has been done.

103,"&gt; allies

Sweden and Finland are not US allies.  They may be friendly with us and visa versa.  They may have alliances with countries that we are also friendly with.  But they do not meet the bar for being allies, because they have not chosen to ally with us, either via NATO or any other route.  They've chosen to be neutral, Finland

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_alliance

&gt; A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance.[1] Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known.

The term is not a synonym for ""friendly country"".

I agree that to abandon an ally is highly objectionable -- that would mean violating an alliance.  But there's a reason that the term is used is ""ally"" and not ""friendly country"".

Finland and Sweden have chosen to be [neutral countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_country).  Being neutral is fundamentally-incompatible with being allied -- it explicitly guarantees *not* to ally.

There's nothing wrong with not allying with every country in the world.  NATO has offered.  Finland and Sweden have, to date, not chosen to enter the NATO alliance, and we have no other form of alliance with them.

Finland and Sweden aren't doing that because they're *dumb* or unable to make the decision.  They have a foreign ministry and intelligence agencies and diplomats and all that, and they decided that at the moment, they are best-off being neutral.  The US has not somehow shunned either: we held a hand out, and they've chosen not to take it thus far -- and that may well be the best decision for them.  We have no way to see the future.  The decision not to ally served Sweden well in World War II (she dodged a lot of conflict) and Finland poorly (she was left without significant help fighting far larger forces).",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7gge1r/nato_should_defend_sweden_finland_if_attacked/dqjk1kr/,vokegaf,1512014476

214,"&gt; Many of your current problems existed when Labour was in charge, and things didn't change much.

True, but they were not quite as bad as they are now. If you looked at the article I linked to, you'll see that immigration only caused a tiny proportion of the problems in the NHS. The majority was due to an ageing native population. The UK was doing pretty well pre-crisis but clearly some areas were effectively ""left behind"". I think that is because of free trade and globalisation managed badly and now that we know about these issues we can work towards resolving them. 

&gt; In Sweden we have taken in alot of asylum seeker but we don't really invest much in them as that would be generally regarded as favoritism or positive discrimination, which isn't exactly something political viable or publically desirable. Which have led to areas with immigration populace that is relatively poorer and more disinigrated from the general society. Immigration itself isn't bad when it's enforced properly at the demand of industries and the nation actually investing in their population both natives and immigrants which does vastly improve the quality of life for everyone. 

Sweden has done an amazing job of taking in refugees and it's pretty disheartening that the UK isn't, despite being one of the richest countries in the world. At the very least, it should stop supplying arms to the people who cause refugees, stop bombing other countries and destabilising them and ban British offshore tax havens, which contribute to poverty in developing countries. My support of open borders goes hand in hand with support for small towns and rural areas (which don't have much immigration but do have plenty of structural problems). So it's not really a one or the other scenario which is what you're implying. Both can and should go together. I wasn't a fan of the old Labour government either for precisely the reasons you mentioned and that's why I advocate for more social welfare and more development aid both within the UK and abroad.

&gt; It would require a huge governmental change that actual invest in your human resources and improves your quality of life. 

I think my quality of life is much better than that of those who crossing the med or dying in Yemen, so I'm pretty happy to lead a simpler life in order for them to be treated with equality. I'm in a comfortable position in the sense that I have a British passport and can choose to migrate to more than a hundred countries around the world but I'm quite happy to live in a smaller house, etc if it means that fewer people are dying trying to get to the UK. I myself have been an immigrant my whole life (though not a refugee) so I understand the perspective of people who do whatever it takes to make it to a developed country.",Brit living in Germany,/r/europe/comments/7gfkfw/woman_reports_rape_to_police_and_is_arrested_on/dqje25k/,durand101,1512007425

ARTICLE 42.

The Turkish Government undertakes to take, as regards non-Moslem minorities,** in so far as concerns their family law or personal status, measures permitting the settlement of these questions in accordance with the customs of those minorities.**

These measures will be elaborated by special Commissions composed of representatives of the Turkish Government **and of representatives of each of the minorities** concerned in equal number. **In case of divergence, the Turkish Government and the Council of the League of Nations will appoint in agreement an umpire chosen from amongst European lawyers**

Turkey further agrees that any difference of opinion as to questions of law or of fact arising out of these Articles between the Turkish Government and any one of the other Signatory Powers or any other Power, a member of the Council of the League of Nations, shall be held to be a dispute of an international character under Article 14 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. The Turkish Government hereby consents that any such dispute shall, if the other party thereto demands, be referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice. The decision of the Permanent Court shall be final and shall have the same force and effect as an award under Article 13 of the Covenant.


The treaty says that representatives of the minorities should be consulted in the election, which Greece does, but they hand pick the clergymen and laymen, who then draw up a list of the muftis that can be appointed and Greece hand picks the person elected.

You don't even understand what I am talking about, my points completely went over your head, and apparently you cant even understand irony.

1) In my first comment, I just corrected that in my opinion, when half of your city is in ruins, and the other half is seriously damaged, infrastructure is in ruin and when half of its civilians dead, the rest is either fled or deported after, I'd consider that city pretty much destroyed (because you gotta basically rebuild the whole thing), just like Stalingrad or Warshaw. Those cities including Leningrad turned into ghost cities in ruins after the war. A ruined city without a population is a destroyed city. Yeah, it was repopulated/rebuild after the war, but thats not my point. Quite a few destroyed cities later got rebuilt (ie Carthage, Jerusalem, etc). Yea, the citizens of Leningrad endured the literal hell, all my deepest respect goes for them, no wonder they are celebrated as heroes by russians.

Then you came with your stupid ass and said

&gt; If the city was destroyed why didn't then your **friend's** army get it?

&gt; some random Nazi's grandson

&gt; ""yeah **we** kind of destroyed that city""

[like what lol hungarians never ever fought anywhere near Leningrad...]


First, you don't need to take a city to destroy it (see Stalingrad, Hirosima and Nagasaki) and...what the fuck dude? You somehow assume I am salty about the germans not taking Leningrad...? Just because Im hungarian and because Hungary fought with the Axis, (which happened decades ago...) must mean Im TODAY a nazi?? THAT SOME FUCKED UP SHIT LOGIC HERE MAN I cant wrap my head around your racist (and yes it was racist) mindset. Even if my grandpa was a nazi (which he wasn't), and even if he killed your grandpa, what the fuck does it have to do with me? I never seen you, did not fight in any wars, I have never been in Russia, I don't hate russians, Im not a nazi, I and Im not antisemitic, even if my my grandpa was a diehard nazi (which, again, he wasnt), it has nothing to do with me. If you'd said all of that first comment of yours face to face to me, I'd punch your ignorant face, and Im a calm person. Its just reeks so much of stupidity I couldn't resist by boiling blood. 

Ill tell you what, my grandfathers family were farmers, the retreating nazis killed his older sister and mother. His father was later arrested and tortured by the soviets because they found some guns in his well, what the nazis threw in when they were retreating. And thats just a small part of my families story of that era.

2) Then I asked you why you'd think Im sad about the nazi defeat, you linked in a fucking Hungary-Axis powers wikia page...like how stupid you have to be not understanding this simple question? Again, like whats the connection with me, my beliefs and worldview, and the fact that Hungary fought with the Axis...? Like you know anything at all about me.

3)

&gt; 300K is the number of all killed Hungarian soldiers in WWII. Add 513 766 of captives. Also add civil servants and etc. All those people had families that supported them. But now it's already clear what history teachers tell you at schools ‚Äî there wasn't any single solitary family which supported Nazi. Of course! Now one can ask any Hungarian and he'll get answer something like ""No, that wasn't our family. It was somebody else."" It is known that victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan. 

Again, you are delusional, making the assumption that every one of them were nazis/far right. If you were enlisted, you had to go, whether or not you agreed on anything with the gov. Refuse the draft, and you go in front of the military court (that was btw the case like everywhere around the world, the govs didn't give a shit about your beliefs). The far right party at that time was around 300k again (thats a fact). Thats not 300k male, and their wives/children/family, thats 300K everyone. The vast majority of the country wasnt  nazi/fascist.

THE REST OF THAT COMMENT WAS IRONY, I EVEN POINTED IT OUT AT THE END LIKE HOW COULD YOU MISS IT. With that irony I wanted to point out that nobody can judge anyone based on their ancestors/countrymen actions, and you did exactly that, its shitty, racist, ignorant and stupid dude. You have one thick skull for sure.

You also have a weird idea about 1956 too, but I won't get into that, its already a fucking essay.

I haven't made any promises i just said i expect the US to fulfill  it's obligations. ¬®
¬®
&gt; The reality is that you can't make any statement, because you depend on what the US decides. And the US doesn't answer to it's ""allies"", it answers to it's people. And if the US public is fickle, and many are growing critical of what they see as Europe free riding off US Forces and uncaring about Russia's desire for a buffer space.

Where did i make any statement on behalf of anyone? The fact that much of Europe doesn't fulfill it's the 2% of GDP spending on the military is quite pathetic and i completely understand why Americans aren't happy about it. I agree that Europe is free riding at the moment, that should change.

&gt; Personally, I partially agree with that. Europeans are treating NATO like a religion, where you join and get an automatic carrier group salvation. It's a mental comforter against making hard decision, or implementing realistic preparation. And it's going to disappoint, like it did so many other countries before.

&gt; You can expect all you want, but you're a Danish citizens and there's only one country which you can have an educated say over their policy.

I answered that and the answer is yes. We are well aware that we don't have massive influence in other countries, but that's fine since we are a small country.

&gt; The 2% was promised for 2024 and it's money that's going straight to the US in the form of F35 requisition and the like. That's not the issue.

Lot's of European countries are large arms producers, especially Britain and France. I don't care where Denmark buy it's arms and equipment i just want the best.

&gt; The issue is that the we all need a defence strategy that has at least one assumptions required: That the US doesn't come to help, that we are alone.

Why are you so skeptical about the US, they have no interest in screwing us over and let Russia control Europe.

&gt; Because to leave our geopolitical safety as a matter of blind faith is just, plain childish.

I have way less faith in Germany supporting us than the US and the polls made in Germany support that. Europe is weak when is comes to power projection.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/7gge1r/nato_should_defend_sweden_finland_if_attacked/dqj8c4p/,danahbit,1512000681

it depends on how trustworthy Trump is.

but my main point is that they probably have several goals, and they are not about securing warm ports, strong positions or anything like this.

they are all about 2 things

- breaking unity and trust, and that is why attack on non-NATO member of EU might be useful, because it is a good dividing line within NATO itself (and probably withing the EU as well).

- having a negotiations, after everyone gets the impression that they are serious guys and not just a country with GDP less than Italy (very popular phrase here).

449,"&gt; I posted a survey that pretty much backs my personal experience,

IMHO this survey is quite biased and for me it's not reliable.  
It was made by [ADL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League) - the controversial organisation that's goal is to find and fight 'anti-semitism'.  

For example if you agree with this sentences you are anti-semite according to them:   
&gt;Jews still talk too much about what happened to them in the Holocaust   
&gt;Jews have too much control over the United States government   

parts 'to much' are not unambiguous and it's hard to find accurate definition if something is 'to much' or just 'big' or 'enough' IMHO.  

 But the [Jewish lobby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_lobby) or [Israel lobby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_lobby_in_the_United_States)  is well known and described, organisations like mentioned ADL is influential too IMHO].   

So would you agree with this senteces:   

&gt;Jews talk (*) about what heppened to them in the Holocaust?  
  - too much,  
  - enought,  
  - too less;  

&gt;Jewish and Israel organisations have (*) influence in US government?   
  - too much,  
  - enought,  
  - too less;

It was published five months after the Brexit referendum. This implies that it was likely commissioned immediately by the European Parliament and was completed in an extremely short period of time as it would have had to go through a process of checking and verification before publication.

Likely, two months at best were spent on these studies. All of the studies were completed by mid tier academics, and commissioned by the European Parliament, not conducted by officials of the ECB or different governments.

486,"I agree that one does not cancel the other.

However, I do suggest that it might be worthwhile to adopt policy where reporting of serious crimes could be somehow permitted without also punishing the reportee.

Historically, prostitution has been associated with illegal immigration.  This puts illegal immigrant women (well, or men, I suppose) in a difficult position: if they report some crime, they will necessarily expose their identity in doing so.  In fact, simply leveraging the possibility of exposure has been a useful tool to accomplish, to some degree, coercion of sex workers.

In the US, I believe that one of the greatest policy errors that we've made has been to place people in a position where they can no longer work with the law enforcement and judicial system.  This has happened at least twice now, and both are correlated with tremendous amounts of crime:

* [Prohibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition).  Crime skyrocketed: smugglers couldn't deal with disputes over alcohol legally, so they took dispute resolution into their own hands, be it guns or bombs or pipes.

* The War on Drugs.  It is the case today that a huge chunk of violence in the US is tied to the drug trade.  I am not entirely sold on legalization -- looking at China in her opium period is profoundly concerning.  However, I am also very unhappy with what's going on now: a lot of illegal business happening with no way to involve police or courts -- and, so, people kill each other to address their disputes.  The drugs themselves are an issue, but the violence on the part of dealers is also a major issue.

I've considered the possibility, a number of times, of having some sort of dispute resolution mechanism, where a court could deal with ""sealed"" cases that involve people voluntarily coming forward to have the legal system deal with some sort of dispute.  The legal system only addresses the issue in question, and holds things like whether there was drug trading going on out of the matter.

That's unpleasant for some people to think about, because it looks like it might facilitate illegal activity.  But...I doubt that the facilitation is a huge effect, and I think that the costs of not doing so have been tremendous.

There are cases where a known wrong is *intentionally* not addressed because it would create mis-incentives.  A few examples:

* In the US (and according to Wikipedia, in EU law as well), there is a legal concept called the [fruit of the poisonous tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_of_the_poisonous_tree).  The idea is that any evidence that is illegally obtained is inadmissable in court.  Any subsequent evidence that was obtained *from* that illegal evidence is also ""tainted"" and is also inadmissable.  In some cases, that has let murderers and other people walk when we know that they are guilty -- but it's seen as a price to pay that is acceptable, as it is even more important to ensure that police follow proper search-and-seizure law.

* [Witness immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness_immunity).  I do not know whether this or an analog exists in Europe or not.  If a prosecutor cannot prosecute a case, they may decide to grant a known criminal immunity from prosecution in exchange for their testimony that will be used in court to put someone else in prison.  This has been especially useful in organized crime cases, where high-level people seek to isolate themselves from directly committing crimes by having someone else take on the risk.

I think that both of these are good things to have in a legal system, though both involve ignoring intentional wrongdoing with the aim of correcting a larger problem of incentives.

I think that there's a good argument that the ability to involve police even if someone has illegally immigrated without automatically exposing the illegal immigration status may be a good idea.  I do not think that it would tremendously encourage illegal immigration (having access to police might be a plus, but I have a hard time seeing it being an overriding plus), but I do think that it might be a valuable tool.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7gfkfw/woman_reports_rape_to_police_and_is_arrested_on/dqj1rrh/,vokegaf,1511993650

The Iraq war comprised of mostly the UK (and Poland &amp; Spain) with the backing of many countries, Afghanistan included almost every country in Europe, The borders of the middle-east were carved by the UK and France, Libya was led by France and the UK, and included most of Europe and participents. The UK even voted not to engage the Syrian government greatly upsetting the US and France, its alleged new ""special partner"" at the time.

You've got to admit, thats pretty embarrassingly ignorant and a very bold statement right? Of-course the UK is going to play more of a part, its the most powerful military on the continent excluding Russia.

It is a significant difference whether you deport people (which should still have drawn harsh penalties after the war, as I said earlier) with a vague understanding of what was happening to them, or if you are helping lead those people directly to death.

&gt;Do you have a citation?

Every major study about this? The police was incorporated into the deportations, but the main work rested with the Gestapo and SD.

Quite fascinating how willingly you put somebody actively working in a death camp on the same level as somebody who might suspect that the Jews would be killed, but wasn't doing it with their own eyes. A lot of the deportations were mislabeled as well regarding their transportation goal.

&gt;No. If you lose control to limit immigration on a national level as all EU states do, you don't regain it at a European level because Europe does not limit immigration to any member states. It only unlimits it.
&gt;

That is where you are wrong, where the EU does not act, it does not quit you of any decission as a sovereign nation to do as you fit as long a certain minimun of common rules are met, be it human rights or internal rules of the club (protectionism).

You cannot lose when said organization that makes you ""lose"" sovereingty does not act. It should be obvious...

&gt; &gt;Big nations tend to be less accountable and less liberal. European-style liberal democracies are a small minority of the world's population. By your logic, you'd surely want to extend EU membership to Turkey and Russia, right? And why not Syria and Afghanistan too while you're at it since bigger is better
&gt;


I've never said that in any shape or form but I guess you tried to reduce to the absurd the conversation. You cannot enter the EU without very strict criteria met, shuch as a liberal democracy where humans rights are protected, with certain a economical level, etc... 
So yeah, neither Turkey or Russia could or should enter, not until A LOT has been corrected.

&gt;Look at gay marriage. Only 10 EU nations allow it out of 28. If we had common EU laws on gay marriage, no EU country would be allowed it. Not all peoples want the same things, and it is best that we allow other countries to be shitter, so that we can be better.
&gt;              

In that you are right but this is a economical matter, whereas the EU is the single biggest economy in the world, which works through a common market, and only if you respect certain rules you can work inside said market.

743,"&gt; I would fully support a pilot program starting from Sweden.

It is already in place we have raised the retirement age considerably, pension reform happened in the 90s, public daycare is in place and parental leave is law which btw is more a burden on employers than anyone else. The TFR now hovers around 1.8-1.9 in large part thanks to these reforms.

Write your government and ask them why they've just decided to lower the retirement age this year despite facing one of the steepest demographic cliffs in Europe.

And yes as u/In_der_Tat says this is not enough imo, income tax should shift to put less burden on families and more on consumption and childless workers, maybe above a certain age, in order to make it less economically taxing to have children and less profitable to just save for your own retirement.

817,"B&amp;H really still needs solving. Dayton agreement put an end to fighting, but it didn't really solve the underlying issue that caused the war. Bosnia still has three ethnic groups, two of which would prefer to secede. 

Look at the best comparison: Libanon. It was originally supposed to be a Christian country, but fearing they lacked self-sufficiency a large chunk of Muslim-majority was also annexed. This mean that Christians were no longer the majority which led to politics becoming inefficient and bogged down in religious and ethnic conflict. For example, bizarre rules were made up for who can occupy what political position:

&gt;Lebanon is a parliamentary democracy that includes confessionalism,[104] in which high-ranking offices are reserved for members of specific religious groups. The President, for example, has to be a Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, the Speaker of the Parliament a Shi‚Äôa Muslim, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament Eastern Orthodox.[105][106] 

This is supposed to prevent ethnic and religious tensions, but the truth is it just means the country is in a perpetual state of political instability, sometimes violent, sometimes not. They couldn't eject IS from the country, because the only one willing to fight them was Hezbollah, but even they couldn't, for fear of upsetting Sunnis. (This was finally resolved by bussing the IS fighters to Deir-ez-zor in Syria, which became famous because USA wanted to bomb the convoy, claiming that there should be no deals with IS.) This also means that surrounding countries constantly interfere in Lebanese politics - Iran through Hezbollah, and KSA through... well, basically kidnapping their prime minister Hariri, who was rescued by Macron ""inviting"" him to France.

821,"There is a lot of misinformation going on about reusable rockets. While in theory it makes sense to not throw away a big part of the rocket every time, it's much more complicated if you want to talk about the economics.

Falcon 9 is a very low-cost rocket. But not because of reusability, despite it. It's a great design, using multiple mass produced engines instead of one big one that is mostly hand built, using the same fuel for lower and upper stage, having all the construction facilities in one place instead of spreading them out all over the country (or continent in our case), using modern production techniques like 3d pringting, etc. That's why they were able to undercut the prices of the traditional launch providers long before they landed a single stage.

Ariane 6 is basically this, building a rocket that is very similar to Ariane 5 but at half the cost. That's actually quite an accomplishment and with that it's actually [cheaper than the Falcon 9 per kg of payload](https://i0.wp.com/www.spaceintelreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ariane-v-Falcon-9-cost-DLR-November-2017.jpg).

Obviously the big elephant in the room is that SpaceX could reduce prices even more when reusing the first stage becomes the norm and they do it multiple times. We don't know yet how much cheaper they can go, we don't know how much the refurbishment costs are. 

What we do know is the basic fact that reusable rockets cost more upfront but get cheaper the more often they can launch the same stage over and over again. And there lies the big problem, the European space market isn't as big as the American and even worse, while the American government (and Russian and Chinese) is forced by law to only buy American rockets, European governments are not. Germany is going to launch new intel satellites on a Falcon 9, the US government would never ever launch a spy satellite on an Ariane rocket, even if it would be cheaper or better suited for the mission.

The worst case would be that Europe builds its own reusable rocket which is even more expensive and then doesn't find many customers, because they aren't allowed to bid in foreign markets and even worse, European governments will still buy foreign rockets. It will end up more expensive than a cheap expendable rocket like the Ariane 6.

&amp;nbsp;

Pop quiz. Do you know what country exports the most refined petroleum of any country in the world? Take a guess. The US? Nope, we're 5th. Russia? Nope, 2nd.
Did you guess the Netherlands? Because surprisingly that is the actual answer:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_refined_petroleum_exports
Second question, what country gets the largest portion of Russia's exports? Take a guess. China? Nope. Iran? Try again.
Again, very surprisingly (at least to me), it's the Netherlands, and it's all oil that needs refining:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_Russia
So maybe the Russia/EU rivalry is not quite as hot as it seems going by the MSM? Maybe it is a bit for show and the two are quite dependent on each other?
However, The Netherlands is smart enough to diversify their income streams. Their economy is not too dependent on the single export of refined petroleum.
Here's a treemap showing all their exports proportionally:
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/2014_Netherlands_Products_Export_Treemap.png
As you can see, it's pretty diversified. However, you know what country isn't diversified? Chad. Let's look at Chad.
Here's the same treemap of Chad's exports:
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Tree_map_export_2009_Chad.jpeg
Looks a bit different, doesn't it? Eggs in one basket much? So the price of unrefined oil essentially determines Chad's GDP for that year. Well at least the exports, which make up 37% of the GDP. Great.
Now, guess who owns the equipment to do all this oil extraction? If you read the title, I'm hoping you're guessing Exxon, and you'd be right. 75% of the infrastructure to extract oil from Chad is owned by Exxon, and the other 25% was owned by Chevron, who sold it to the Chadian Government for $1.3 Billion dollars. In 2014.
https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevron-announces-sale-of-interests-in-chad-and-cameroon
Where did the Government of Chad get the money for that?! Why they got a huge loan, of course. Who did they get a loan from? Why none other than Glencore, the 14th largest company in the world, who also does extraction of oil and coal, as well as copper and zinc and already has some oil operations in southern Chad. What a coincidence. /s
https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/glencoremapforweb.png?w=1024&amp;h=725
Meanwhile through all of this, the GDP of Chad has increased from $1.3 Billion in 2001 to $11 Billion in 2015. Almost 10x in just 20 years. Pretty good!
Guess what the revenue of Exxon and Glencore was in 2015, for comparison? More or less than Chad? Exxon had revenue of $218 Billion, and Glencore had revenue of $152 Billion. That's the yearly equivalent of 20 Chads and 14 Chads, respectively.
You've heard of ""company towns"", where the town is basically owned by one company? Well this is a ""company nation"" and it's far from the only one.
So really what we are seeing in 2014 is Chevron effectively selling their 25% ownership of Chad to Glencore, and doing it through the Chadian government in a way so they're on the hook for over a billion dollars of additional debt. Debt slavery, but on a national scale, to a whole government. They're also contractually required to pay it off in just 4 years! I don't think they're going to make that payment schedule, which would end in 2018. I wonder what Glencore will demand in return for missed payments. What laws they will have the Chadian government make for them, in return for extending their debt deadlines.
Now on top of all this, in the most recent twist, as of November 2016 the Chadian Government is now suing Exxon for $74 Billion. That is 5x the GDP of Chad.
https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/11/16/exxons-74-billion-fine-in-chad-unbelievable-economic-numbers-are-unbelievable/#6ebfd3cd6878
The government are in a sense biting the hand that feeds them, with Exxon being responsible for essentially 75% of Chad's GDP. Exxon is unlikely to pay, because even though their insanely huge profit for 2015 (not revenue, but income profit) was a staggering $16 Billion dollars, that is still dwarfed by a $74 Billion lawsuit.
Will Chad settle for less than $74 Billion? Is this just a money grab and they won't actually hold Exxon's feet to the fire, and they just want a cut and will settle for a few hundred million? Perhaps. They do have that Glencore debt coming due in 2018, and the lawsuit may be their way to try and get money to pay that debt. A Hail Mary pass for sure.
If they don't back down and neither does Exxon, will the Chadian government use the military and exile Exxon and take over the equipment when Exxon refuses to pay? Or going even more deeply, is this lawsuit perhaps essentially Glencore kicking out Exxon, to gain control of the Chadian market? It would be great to find information on who funded and created the lawsuit, but it seems this information is hard to come by.
This is where the story stands for now. I've searched, and there seems to be a moratorium of news about this since the announcement of the lawsuit 6 months ago. The last I saw, Exxon was ""in talks"" with the Government of Chad. We will have to wait and see what happens next, but it's clear there's a strong division forming between Exxon and the Government of Chad, possibly being pushed by Glencore.
It seems that Chad is merely a plaything in games played by companies that are 10x bigger than countries. Reminds me of the British East India company, and how they essentially owned India for 100 years before the British Government actually stepped in and took ownership. But this is happening in 2017, and it's about oil.
This is called petro-imperialism. People often think of imperialism in the case of a nation conquering another nation with their army, but it also happens with companies. Companies that are even financially larger than nations, who hire mercenaries to defend their oil equipment and take over governments.
Ever wonder why they don't teach this in school?

there were no genocides, he was never nationalist, all he did was never for ethnic reasons, it was  politics.

[This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#/media/File:Nicotine.svg) is the structure of nicotine. A few features of note include the pyridine ring in the bottom left and the pyrrolidine ring in the top right.

[Here's a typical neonicotinoid, Bayer's Imidacloprid](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Imidacloprid.svg) Note that we've still got that pyridine ring on the left and a 5 membered nitrogen containing ring on the right.

Now, [here's Glyphosate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate#/media/File:Glyphosate.svg) Note the total absence of any heterocyclic features, and the presence of a phosphate group on the left, as well as a carboxcylic acid on the right.

Glyphosate has none of the structural features of a neonicotinoid whatsoever. It actually shares more structural similarity with [vinegar](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Acetic-acid-2D-flat.png) which at least has a carboxcylic acid group.

1090,"There was a hunger in the Soviet Union and that was a tradegy caused by combined efforts of mismanagement, sheer stupidity, poor yield and drought.

Holodomor is an artificial propaganda myth based on nothing but telepathic mindscan of long-dead people who were presumed to hate Ukrainians. They hated them so much that they ceased to increase grain export once problem with malnutrition became apparent and sent support to territories which were stuck by hunger.

This myth gets more ridiculous once we look at the statistics:

So here is the quantity of crops (wheat, rye, corn, etc) harvested by Soviet agricultural industry, year by year.

**1930** - 830,5k centenrs, 26,5% of which was purchased by the state. 

**1931** - 695k centners, 32,9% of which was purchased by the state.

**1932** - 699k centners, 26,5% of which was purchased by the state.

**1933** - 898k centners, 25,5% of which was purchased by the state.

**1934** - 894k centners, 25,3% of which was purchased by the state.

**1935** - 920k centners, 27,1% of which was purchased by the state.

Source: [Soviet agriculture. Annual report, 1935.](http://istmat.info/node/22433)

Two quick but fabulous conclusions:

1. Never did Soviet government take more than 30% of harvested crops for export or other needs.

2. After the fatefull 1932 and 1933 when millions of people (a third of UaSSR pre-war populations, no less) were supposedly killed, Soviet agriculture yielded a surprisingly big amount of harvest. Who did that? Ghosts? Zombies?

And here is an extract from the protocol of Politburo's meeting. April 29, 1932.

The problem was getting serious, so the Politburo decided:

1. Foreign Trade Committee (FTC or –ù–∞—Ä–∫–æ–º–∞—Ç –≤–Ω–µ—à–Ω–µ–π —Ç–æ—Ä–≥–æ–≤–ª–∏) should return 15k tonns of corn and 2k tonns of wheat from ports into possession of the Procurement Committee (PC or –∫–æ–º–∏—Ç–µ—Ç –∑–∞–≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–æ–∫).

2. FTC shoud purchase 3,5 mln poods (1 pood is 16 kg) of crops from Far Eastern regions and the Central Bank should facilitate all necessary tranzactions.

It's only rightful because there also are organized group that commit terror attack. If it was only a few killing spree per decade made by isolated peoples, well the whole thing would be quite overblown. But we have big terror attack and a huge number of loners attack too. 

But so far in Belgium, and in France, we didn't have any organized far-right terror groups. But in Germany, you did have some organized groups and the frequency of attacks is ramping up, so the situation is more worrying. 

&gt;The current fear is that if we tolerate intolerance for too long we might lose what we have built over the years. 

I'm afraid you'll have to look at the root causes. We know in Belgium and in France, that not only do we have an issue with imported conflict, to an extend, but that our failures to properly integrate immigrant is causing the issue. 

Quite mechanically, the frustration coming from the ""cit√©s"" is causing us trouble, and there is not much that the inhabitant can do. The idea that the failure of the state itself, quite obvious in terms of education and policing, are responsible for the issues they cause is a huge rampart against the far right.

Similarly that should means that the issue you're facing is coming from poverty, social exclusion and lack of security as well. If I remember well, Germany has an issue with poor workers.  ",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/7g331f/german_prorefugee_mayor_stabbed/dqi0d1e/,Account235,1511950372

Well the first time I saw written Afrikaans I could just read it and it read like Dutch with insanely silly grammar and then I heard it spoken which interestingly enough was a Belgian reporter interviewing an actor from South Africa and both were speaking their own language and I could also follow the interview.

Afrikaans to me is sort of like ""African American Vernacular English"" though in that if you don't appreciate that is its own language with its own native speakers and grammar rules it really just sounds like ridiculously bad grammar and on top of that a double negative doesn't imply a positive in it it seems.

1195,"&gt;best and brightest students are swept off to the west

They chose to go to the West to study and they have the option of returning but they don't because the wages are shit, that's not my fault, thats because they want a better life for themselves.

&gt;To some extent we bear some of the blame for African migration. Yes, African governments are corrupt but they have to keep the stolen money somewhere. I wonder where? This is a pretty complicated issue and it will be interesting to see how it is resolved.

Yes we do bear some of the blame for African migration, in fact we encourage it because they now know that the rich white man will come and pick them up and bring them to Europe where something known as the welfare state exists. These people are not naive in the slightest, they know exactly what kind of life to expect in Europe should they make it there and they are excited for it. We need to enforce stricter laws on deportation but also we need to begin refusing them access to Europe by intimidation and by turning the ships away. African governments can easily stash the money in their own country but I hardly see how by dictators using swiss bank accounts why I should expect huge amounts of uneducated and unskilled young men in my home.

The truth is that they will be infinitely happier living in Africa rather than in Europe when Africa's economy begins to grow but the most crucial thing is the birth rate, it needs to be reduced, we need to stop food aid to African countries if they cannot implement family planning. Africa is already 20% uninhabitable I believe and we are seeing mass immigration to Europe from Africa.

1197,"&gt; We can't guarantee a soft border unless we have negotiated a trade agreement with the EU. 

Give one reason why.

&gt; They're really hopeful that if they behave this way, the UK will just cancel Brexit and stay in the single market 

They are protecting their countries interests, what Britain wants is irrelevant. Brexit is a disaster and Ireland is rightfully giving the UK a dose of reality.

&gt; so they need to wake up and try to work on the only possible path that can lead to a soft border. 

Again you are making claims that have no basis. The UK has not given any reasons why a soft border is ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù they haven‚Äôt come up with anything but ‚Äú we can‚Äôt do it yet‚Äù.

&gt; Whether the UK overpromised things originally doesn't change the fact Ireland is currently making a soft border impossible

This is the UKs problem not Ireland‚Äôs. If you make agreements and don‚Äôt keep them, don‚Äôt expect people to bend over to accommodate you.

&gt; that is not in their interest. 

If Ireland do not get any guarantees now,a hard border is still a possibility. they have no meaningful veto once it passes to the trade negotiations stage. It‚Äôs in Ireland‚Äôs interest to get an answer of guarantees to a very important issue now (which the EU wholly agrees) before the UK can move on to trade.

I mean, say it's 476 AD.  The Roman Empire has just ended.  You still have a bunch of fancy buildings in Rome -- they aren't going anywhere.  But Rome is clearly pretty screwed up, has been sacked.

1243,"&gt;So...fuck anyone who is seeking education then?

As far as I'm concerned, immigrants are people who have a right to vote in UK general elections. A foreigner who comes here to study does not get to vote, and thus is just a temporary resident.

Our education institutions should be primarily to educate British people, to make Britain better. Why should we be educating the Chinese for them to go back to make China better? We will let some do that, because like foreign aid, it creates goodwill and so on, but we must limit it because our goal is to make Britain better educated. Would you be ok if 90% of Irish university places were taken by Chinese and Indian people? If they want better education they should create their own universities and not steal ours. China soon will have better ones than us anyway.

&gt;Seeing another point of view could change their minds. Keeping all the hate together just makes it fester.

Who do you think hates Jews more? The Japanese, who have 0 Jews in their country and thus don't get to see the Jewish point of view, or the Palestinians who have 6 million Jews in their territory and thus know the Jewish point of view very well? The idea that if we're just kind to people they will become like us is a fantasy. How did being kind work out for the Native Americans? How did it work out for Tibetans? 

&gt;I personally know greek people and I can't say they have a particularly strong love or hate for either of those countries anymore than others do.

They elected a radical left leader who named his son after Che Guevara. Polls show [Greece is the most Russophilic country in the EU](http://greece.greekreporter.com/files/PG_2017.08.16_Views-of-Russia_006.png) and also the most anti-US. [Here's another poll which shows Greece is even more anti-US and pro-Russia than some Muslim countries](http://greece.greekreporter.com/files/PG_2017.08.16_Views-of-Russia_003.png). Partly it's because they are Eastern Orthodox, but it's also because communism is still seen positively in Greece which never actually suffered under it like the rest of Eastern Europe did, thanks to Churchill saving them from Stalin who was about to invade. Greece is also [the most anti-semitic country in Europe by some measures](http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/07/Lede-chart-2.png). But I'd far rather have a moderately anti-semitic Greek immigrant than a genocidally anti-semitic middle eastern one. We simply must start to judge immigrants by their values. It's not acceptable that a Salafi from Saudi Arabia can simply pay ¬£400k or whatever it is, and receive British citizenship and start spreading their religious views in the UK. Immigration should be based on ideology, not economics.

&gt;Well I'm currently living in the UK and I love it here. However if you were in charge of immigration myself and my boyfriend wouldn't be allowed to be here. Between us we have irish, french and romanian citizenship, and neither of us arrived already equipped with degrees and phds.

The Irish are entitled to British citizenship by birth. I am not against French or Romanian people coming here either. I would even be ok with increasing immigration levels, so long as the immigrants were better vetted. Given that for example, 67% of Pakistanis support the death penalty for apostates, we need to vet them so that we only take in people from the minority that hold liberal values. Romanians are much more liberal on average than Pakistanis. It's much better to judge people as individual, but it's extremely difficult to vet people with limited information, so generalising by country of origin is acceptable too. We already give greater right to immigrate to former commonwealth citizens, and currently greater right to EU citizens, so it's not illegal racial discrimination to give Romanians an advantage over Pakistanis after Brexit. 

&gt;The UK is better than this blind distaste for foreigners.

So would you like to have an open border with Africa and the middle east? I don't think so. The only reason you continue to like living here is because we have a closed border and don't just let anyone in.",,/r/europe/comments/7fgmm5/brexit_is_britains_vietnam_every_rational_person/dqhul8j/,pacifismisevil,1511936827

1248,"I was just reading a paper about trying to estimate GDP in the USSR not long ago, and there's a remarkable range of estimates.  I think that you may be beating up on /u/HTS-got-Damascus kinda unfairly if you think he's trying to fudge up a weak excuse for low USSR numbers or think that he's insisting that one adopt Marxist economic theory to measure Soviet performance.

It's true that the USSR didn't have a market economy, which made it really hard to produce a bunch of economic numbers.  As I understand it, it's not that the concept of measuring wealth or economic activity in the USSR is invalid, but that it's a pain in the butt to come up with meaningful data, because your prices become disconnected from what something would be worth in a market.  So you have to estimate what the things produced are actually worth.

In a market economy, you can say ""I produced N chickens, which had a market value of N times the price P"".  Thus, NP in value was generated by raising those chickens.

In a market economy, you can get a pretty good idea of the value of something by looking at the price in the marketplace.

But...if the Soviet Union says ""chickens will cost artificial price A"", then that's what they get priced at.  You might wind up with shortages if that price is lower than the market price (which was often the case), but the Kremlin setting A doesn't actually affect the *value* of what the thing is -- just the price that it's sold at.  If you just multiply A by N, then if the Kremlin sets the price of chicken to be lower than the market price, you're underestimating the economic activity has happened.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7g5e2r/gdp_per_capita_of_european_countries_at_the_brink/dqhuplp/,vokegaf,1511937058

This second group were predominantly residents of colonies which had become independent, but who had not become citizens of the new country.

1323,"&gt; Some amendments have clauses like that built in.

All modern ones do: they started precisely because they realized that this was a problem.  I assume that it was easier to build a limitation into each amendment than to pass an amendment to modify the amendment process for a fairly minor, technical issue.

&gt;I don't think any amendment is going to creep by without notice haha.

Probably, but realistically it's a flaw in the Constitution, even if in practice, it doesn't come up much.

In theory, if some group of over 25% of state legislatures wanted to do so, they could complete the ratification of ancient proposed amendments and then block any attempt to repeal the amendment.

I'd also add that I'm not completely sure what the three-quarters-of-states rules for ratification of an amendment are if there were states added in the intervening period.  I'm not sure whether the Supreme Court has ever ruled on it.  If it was three-quarters of the states at the time of the proposal, then it might only take one ratification or two to modify the Constitution.

On the face of it, you might think ""well, *obviously* it should be three-quarters of the total number of states at the time that the ratification occurred"".  But that really has some major negative legal implications: it means that it would be possible for the federal government to block a proposed federal amendment after its proposal, because all that is required to add a state is Congressional approval.  The idea behind the amendment process was explicitly that the federal government had no necessary part in the process to modify the federal government's powers.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7g3rmw/make_america_great_britain_again/dqhpnhs/,vokegaf,1511929389

&gt; √Üthelstan continued the expansion of his father and aunt and was the first king to achieve direct rulership of what we would now consider England. The titles attributed to him in charters and on coins suggest a still more widespread dominance. His expansion aroused ill-feeling among the other kingdoms of Britain, and he defeated a combined Scottish-Viking army at the Battle of Brunanburh. However, the unification of England was not a certainty. Under √Üthelstan's successors Edmund and Eadred the English kings repeatedly lost and regained control of Northumbria. Nevertheless, Edgar, who ruled the same expanse as Athelstan, consolidated the kingdom, which remained united thereafter.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Brunanburh

&gt; Following an unchallenged invasion of Scotland by √Üthelstan in 934, possibly launched because of a peace treaty violation by Constantine, it became apparent that √Üthelstan could only be defeated by an allied force of his enemies. Olaf led Constantine and Owen in the alliance. In August 937, Olaf and his army crossed the Irish Sea to join forces with Constantine and Owen but the invaders were routed in the battle against √Üthelstan.

You're right that theoretically, price elasticity of demand *could* play a meaningful role if some industry had unusually inelastic demand, though I am comfortable saying that of the two metrics, wages are more interesting if you can only use one metric or the other.

But in any event, I suspect that any skilled immigration system that the British might use would mostly eliminate that as a factor by looking at *current* wages rather than wages at the beginning of any such agreement.

1442,"Obviously, amendments to the US Constitution can alter anything, but there would be two major impediments.

First, the Constitution's [Title of Nobility Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand):

&gt;No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States: and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.

I don't think that people actually are normally required to renounce titles upon obtaining US citizenship, so it might be that in theory, someone *could* retain existing titles: there's certainly European royalty that lives in the US.  I think a coronation of a crown prince to be king would probably count as granting a title.

I think that it would be at the least a political handicap, though.

The second issue is that AFAIK the children will not be born on US soil: they will receive US citizenship from their mother, who is an American citizen.  The US Constitution's [Natural-born Citizen Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-born-citizen_clause) has a fairly-unusual-in-US-law requirement: that the President must be a natural-born citizen, not merely a citizen.  That means being born on US soil: [*jus soli*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_soli) is the *only* relevant metric here, with [*jus sanguinis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_sanguinis) irrelevant.

This is not something that has quite the same political stigma in the past; society is a much-more-international one today, and people travel a lot more than they once did.  John McCain was born in a US military zone in Panama; probably not US soil, and the question of whether he could run for President came up but was not, as I recall, a terribly critical issue.  It's quite possible that if it came up as a serious barrier to some Presidential candidate, that the states might amend the Constitution to some less-stringent criteria to avoid questions of legitimacy.

However, it looks like Prince Harry lives in the UK, so I assume that his wife will also give birth there.

Finally, realistically, the British royal family is no longer, for nearly all practical purposes, running the United Kingdom.

1452,"Obviously, amendments to the US Constitution can alter anything, but there would be two major impediments in the Constitution.

First, the Constitution's [Title of Nobility Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand):

&gt;No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States: and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.

I don't think that people actually are normally required to renounce titles upon obtaining US citizenship, so it might be that in theory, someone *could* retain existing titles: there's certainly European royalty that lives in the US.  I think a coronation of a crown prince to be king would probably count as granting a title.

I think that it would be at the least a political handicap, though.

The second issue is that AFAIK the children will not be born on US soil: they will receive US citizenship from their mother, who is an American citizen.  The US Constitution's [Natural-born Citizen Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-born-citizen_clause) has a fairly-unusual-in-US-law requirement: that the President must be a natural-born citizen, not merely a citizen.  That means being born on US soil: [*jus soli*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_soli) is the *only* relevant metric here, with [*jus sanguinis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_sanguinis) irrelevant:

&gt;No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty-five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.

This is not something that has quite the same political stigma in the past; society is a much-more-international one today, and people travel a lot more than they once did.  John McCain was born in a US military zone in Panama; probably not US soil, and the question of whether he could run for President came up but was not, as I recall, a terribly critical issue.  It's quite possible that if it came up as a serious barrier to some Presidential candidate, that the states might amend the Constitution to some less-stringent criteria to avoid questions of legitimacy.

However, it looks like Prince Harry lives in the UK, so I assume that his wife will also give birth there, meaning that his children will be US citizens, but not natural-born US citizens.  AFAIK, other than that one clause in the Constitution, there's no real disadvantage that a non-natural-born US citizen has versus a natural-born one, but it would matter on this point.

Finally, realistically, the British royal family is no longer, for nearly all practical purposes, running the United Kingdom.  Though I admit that it'd be damned weird to have the King running the US but not the UK and probably generally break all sorts of complicated rules of diplomatic protocol.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7g3rmw/make_america_great_britain_again/dqhjmvw/,vokegaf,1511922279

1539,"&gt; No it can't. I'm not giving my opinion here, I am informing you of the indisputable fact that single market and customs union are indivisible

Turkey is [in customs union with the EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union%E2%80%93Turkey_Customs_Union) -- on terms that, I'd point out, are disadvantageous for Turkey and which Turkey is seeking to renegotiate -- but is not in the European Single Market.

Were the British to do this, it would eliminate a customs border without requiring the UK to accept the single market, but statements from the British government have ruled that out (at least in the long term -- some people here have talked about it as being possible as a short-term transition arrangement).

The EU is not presently willing to let non-EU parties have direct input into setting tariffs to the EU, so it requires those parties to simply accept a tariff schedule set by the EU.

If I were the British, I probably would not accept something like this unless (a) I have input into the tariff schedule equivalent to being any other member and (b)  the EU committed to some substantial changes in tariffs (which I think would be very good for the EU, but also very politically difficult for the EU).  Currently, the EU tariff schedule tends to protect agriculture: in particular, dairy products.  Manufactured products have very little protection.  That makes EU Customs Union membership to tends to transfer wealth from EU members that are net agricultural importers to EU members that are net agricultural exporters -- that is, it's probably great for France and not so great for Germany.  The UK is a net agricultural importer: the high EU agricultural tariffs tend to force her to purchase more goods from within the EU than would likely otherwise be the case.

I am not familiar with the politics behind this, but I'd assume that a lot of this is driven by domestic politics: that farmers in places like France are a difficult political bloc to deal with WRT the EU, so they had to be bought off by a lot of protectionist policy.  Stripping that away would irk off a lot of farmers.

If the EU were willing to drop her agricultural tariffs, it would make membership more-appealing for the British.  But I doubt that she'd be willing to do that.

(Also, the US, as a major agricultural exporter that doesn't have an FTA with the EU, would no doubt enthusiastically be cheering any reduction in EU agricultural tariffs...but I would bet against that happening in the near future.)",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7fls2q/the_irish_republics_eu_commissioner_has_said/dqhcmq4/,vokegaf,1511914332

1598,"&gt; and with the exception of some categories, UK people are saturating the job market. 

Two points:

* ""Saturation"" isn't really meaningful in that there's increasing demand at different price points.  For example, if I could have medical care cheaply enough, I'd happily have a personal doctor dedicated to me.

* If demand for all professions were roughly proportional to supply, wages would be roughly comparable for all jobs in the UK.  However, they aren't: you have some low-skill jobs and some high-skill jobs.

I agree that ""high-skill"" and ""low skill"" are perhaps not the perfect terms to use.  One might have a PhD in underwater basket weaving, as the saying goes, but see no demand for labor.  But generally-speaking, jobs that are in greater demand are high-skill -- the lower the education and training requirements, the easier it is to move someone into that field.  So generally-speaking, high-skill jobs are also more-highly-paid.

&gt; UK has a skill shortage in blue collar workers.  A bricklayer is a skilled job.

It's more-skilled than a ditch digger.  But not as much so as a doctor.

The supply relative to demand can be approximated by wage:

http://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/worklife/careers/a33179/average-job-salaries-uk/


&gt; 8: Medical practitioners ‚Äì ¬£69,463

-

&gt; 88: Bricklayers and masons - ¬£24,790

1680,"Not really.

We were mere hours away from a breakdown of government today, Frances stepped down with 2-3 hours to spare. Leo is an exceptional weak leader, both politically with the coalition and amongst the people. He wasn‚Äôt elected by the people, he was appointed by FG. He isn‚Äôt liked by his coalition partners and FF flexed today by declaring how little they care for him. FF was prepared to end the 33rd Dail today and it was going to happen because Leo refused to back down despite FG requests advising otherwise. 

If today‚Äôs events don‚Äôt paint the picture clearly then nothing will, Leo is a weak leader and he‚Äôs one of many in a long line of weak leaders in this country. Leo has a tenuous amount of support from his party, his partners and his people. He has no power walking into a Brexit deal, if he makes an arrangement FF don‚Äôt like then they can end the government. The only reason there is a coalition is because politics is at an all time low in Ireland and everyone lost. We had a period of 6-8 months where no government was formed and Edna and his cabinet carried out their duties as provided for under the Irish constitution.


If today was the day and Leo was gone, he would still be acting -PM until an official election is held meanig he would still lead through Brexit. Absolutely nothing would change.

1686,"&gt; How does the importing of 1000s of IT developers increase the demand of a retail worker exactly?

Because those developers themselves produce demand -- they go down to the shoe store and purchase pairs of shoes at retail.  And they reduce the cost of providing IT services, which is an input to the cost of goods and services that those retail workers purchase.

There [isn't a fixed amount of labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy) to be done except for in the [primary sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_sector_of_the_economy), where the land determines what you can do -- can't mine coal unless you have coal deposits, for example.  And little of British or other advanced economies is tied up in the primary sector.

What immigration does is shift relative demand in different parts of the economy.

&gt;And more importantly how does that alledged increase in demand benefit the retail worker more than if the company importing the IT workers in trained those retail workers to become developers? 

Like, adult education?  I mean, that'd be great too.  But broadly speaking, a country will already ""try to train people as developers"" from the get-go anyway in that it tries to get average educational achievement to rise.  So it's already doing that: the wage difference between a supermarket checker and that IT developer exists because its educational system cannot reliably produce all the developers that it wants.  Immigration makes for a reliable ""plan B"" for if it can't train kids up as far as it would ideally like, since a country can pick-and-choose who it lets in.  If you need botanists, you aren't gambling that *maybe* someone coming in knows how to be a botanist...you can just let in botanists.

I do think that today, we are very far from our ideal in education.  Education, unlike almost every industry out there, hasn't changed all *that* much in its basic mechanisms from how it worked hundreds of years ago.  I think that our bang-for-the-buck is probably a long ways from whatever some ideal educational system could put out.  Personally, I have a lot of faith that in the long term, [MOOCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooc) will become a significant chunk of the solution there.

Adult education has some other issues.  People may be taking care of kids, may find it psychologically-difficult to ""start over"" in a new field, younger people have an easier time learning some things, etc.  It's not impossible, mind: my dad decided went out to go earn an engineering masters degree in his sixties while simultaneously working full-time, but I think that he's probably got more drive than the typical guy on the street (that is, I don't know whether *I'd* want to do that).  I think that we can probably do a better job of mitigating most of those issues than we do today, but they *are* still barriers.

However, there's also one fundamental issue with adult education.   It's that people only live so long.  So if you educate someone halfway through, say, a 50 year working life, you're only going to get 25 years of trained work out of them.  That can certainly be worthwhile, but it means that your bang-for-the-buck is immediately halved.  If you can extend people's useful working life -- keep their minds sharp longer, keep them alive, keep them healthy -- you can reduce the impact of switching professions at any given age, but it's always going to be a real issue.

Believe me, though, if we had a magic button that could retrain people effectively, I'd be delighted to make use of that.  I just don't believe that we've been able to develop such a thing yet: our retraining and adult education efforts just have not been capable, to date, of singlehandedly keeping up with shifting demand in the market.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7fr03d/uk_government_told_to_accept_high_immigration_or/dqh5weg/,vokegaf,1511906991

I disagree. People are eating way more than what they should, especially in Europe.

&gt;If Europe produces less, America (or any other continent) has to produce more. 

Not if the goal is to make price per kalorie higher in Europe, then you just set tax on foreign food to match the local price.

1759,"This is a really nitpicky area of US law I happen to very familiar with, mostly because I'm tickled by edge cases like this.

The US Constitution conveys citizenship by jus soli. However, ""jus soli"" only applies to U.S. states, D.C., and ""incorporated"" territories of the US - ie, territories that the US intends to eventually incorporate as a state. The last incorporated territories were Hawaii and Alaska.  (There's also a tiny island with no people in the middle of the pacific.) You don't get citizenship just from being born on a US military base.

The US also conveys citizenship by statutory law. That's how, for example, people born in Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens - a statute provides for it. 

At the time McCain was born, a statute provided that the children of U.S. citizens born *outside the jurisdiction of the United States* were U.S. citizens.  But McCain wasn't born *outside the jurisdiction of the U.S.*- he was born in the Canal Zone, which was controlled by the U.S.  And no statute otherwise provided for citizenship of kids born in the Canal Zone.  

There was a legal gap, which was fixed a year later to retroactively grant citizenship to people like McCain. ",,/r/europe/comments/7g3rmw/make_america_great_britain_again/dqgy1by/,deaduntil,1511899629

The first person in the new line of succession to be affected by this change when it came into effect was George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews, who had married a Catholic in 1988, and was restored to the line of succession in 34th place, after the Duke of Kent.[16] The provision of the Act of Settlement requiring the monarch to be a Protestant continues.",,/r/europe/comments/7g3rmw/make_america_great_britain_again/dqgqjvf/,Chintoka2,1511892434

Considering the *part of the EU* you are in, I would not be finding solace in that if I were you. Last I checked, western subsidy (which the west is increasingly tired of having to pay), is the only reason that some parts of europe even have roads, electricity, and running water. In the Balkans there's a sharp contrast between the EU parts of it and places like Kosovo, Albania, or FYROM. 

&gt;  One I think could have been altogether avoided, along with numerous deaths over the last few years, be they perpetrated by migrants or those critical of or affected by the crisis, specifically the EU's shameful handling of it

Wars create refugees. If anything, the main factor that could have been handled differently is that instead of constantly free-riding the NATO alliance, the European allies could have all pulled their own weight when it comes to managing the geostrategic situation in Europe's own backyard. Any country who actually matters in the world does this. 

Things could have turned out much differently with just a few blue helmets. If anything, I'd imagine that anybody from the former Yugoslavia would understand that. Since that IS what eventually happened when Milosevic and the situation in Yugoslavia  got out of line.

Tottle isn't a historian, but an edgy ordinal activist who had withdrawn his book from circulation after communists acknowledged the famine. His book based on nothing.

Kondrashin is a real historian, academic. His work is based on real archives and eyewitness.

&gt;  Literally every other historian other than kondrashin says bad weather was a factor.

None of them. Saying that ""bad weather caused the famine"" is like saying ""Jews killed themselves"" for a historian.

People will just laugh at you for saying such things. It's anti-scientifical and contradicts the archival documents of that time.

2029,"Hrm. The West should have gotten involved *earlier*, if anything. Bosniaks were quite publicly begging for help from *anyone willing to help* very early in that war, because they couldn't handle it and that was obvious to anyone with two brain cells to rub together.

The West responded by sending diplomats who did nothing but delay. They didn't get properly involved until Srebrenica happened, and even that was mostly USA's doing, and in any case it was air-support, while ground troops and artillery were us and Bosniaks.

Or, to put it in a different way~

The international community at large DID get involved very early in the war - by the UN putting a weapons' embargo on Yugoslavia (remember who sits at UN Security Council). Sounds wise, doesn't it? Except weapons were already in Yugoslavia, from the national army JNA, which very fast turned into de-facto Serbian army. So whatever we had to defend ourselves, we stole from JNA directly, or produced on our own, or smuggled at inflated prices. Now look at Bosnia on a map. *Whatever the Bosniaks had, Croatia or Serbia needed to pass through themselves*, and they didn't get much (anything?) from Serbia.

2030,"You keep bringing up things that have no bearing to this discussion. Pipi Langkous doesn't look like a specific stereotype, nor does Harry Potter or St Nick himself. You then use these harmless characters and put them in the same light as the racist way black people were drawn back before cartoonists wised up and stopped using it. The thing you then ignore is the way ZP looks today (which is other than Schenkman once envisioned) looks exactly like page slaves from the 18th century.

While you say stereotypes itself cant be racist [ there a plenty of examples to counter that point]( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/007/617/jew_basic.jpg). There is no context in that picture, it is just a stereotypical image a jew. That's all that's needed.


&gt; Yes, and Geert Wilders makes me uncomfortable, but is that a reason to ban bleached hair? Miniskirts make a lot of religious hardliners uncomfortable too, let's ban them? ""I feel uncomfortable"" is not a sufficient reason to force other people to adhere to your personal taste.

But it goes beyond personal taste. Almost everyone and everywhere people understand that painting yourself black with nappy hairs and big red lips is to make a stereotype out of black people. The same reason we dont see africans portrayed as Sjimmie or as in Kuifje or de Vandersteen comics. There is no such association with bleached hair or miniskirts.

&gt; So you agree that we're not making fun of Sinterklaas, even though he's a stereotype. The same applies to Zwarte Piet.

No im question if he is even a stereotype.

&gt; So she's only valid as an argument when she supports your ideas, but not when she doesn't? Fascinating.

Don't misconstrue what I said. Cheap tactics like that make me want to stop having this conversation. I said people were speaking out against it for a while. Her argument is valid but the argument against ZP has evolved over time. But I only mentioned her as an example that criticism again ZP doesn't just started to appear two years ago.

&gt; I don't see how that is relevant to the discussion whether there is a good reason to change Zwarte Piet. Greenhouse gas emissions are still rising, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea

Good thing changing ZP appearance doesnt make sea levels rise.  Changing ZP to another color would not change a damn thing or at least, it wont impact anyone negatively.

2126,"&gt; So do you understand now why burning plants isn't the same as burning fossil fuels?

No I don't because it isn't. Just that one process takes a lot more time, but is not fundamentally different. 

Both is CO2 captured from the air and stored in solid form. Just that one is older and thus the CO2 was captured a long time ago. 

Both are part of the exact same process: 

solid hydrocarbon -&gt; burninging -&gt; CO2

CO2 -&gt; photosynthesis -&gt; solid hydrocarbon


In the end what counts is atmospheric CO2 concentration and it doesn't matter how you capture the CO2 or what you burn to release it. It's the net difference between those values that matters because net CO2 concentration in the air matters.

Because of pressure from the nuclear energy sector, CDU/CSU-FDP government prolonged the time for the phase-out in 2010. They prolonged the run times of the reactors by 8 respectively 14 years.
However they did not undo the parts about banning the construction of new nuclear power plants, so the last German nuclear power plant would have been shut down around 2034. 

Then in 2011 Fukushima happened and the CDU/CSU-FDP government decided to follow the population instead of the nuclear energy sector, and they agreed to a new phase-out, last plant to be shut-down by 2022. 


82% of the parliament voted in favor of that new phase out law. In surveys, 80% of the population agreed with the phase-out.

‚ÄúThe government could have amended the motion, and that is still a fallback position for them. But without doing that, **failure to provide all the information does not meet the terms of the humble address and is potentially a breach of privilege,**‚Äù he told the Guardian.

‚Äú**This is nothing to do with Brexit or party politics ‚Äì it is to do with the rights of the House of Commons.** We will all be in opposition one day ‚Äì and it is important to remember that.

At the Institute of Aviation held a conference dedicated to the promotion of the rocket, which in October during a successful test flight reached a ceiling of almost 15 km. It is a technology demonstrator that can be used in the future for scientific purposes but also for military purposes. This is finally the field for commercialization of the project, especially in light of the market's upward trend in terms of small satellites.
ILR-33 ""Bursztyn"" rocket is the first Polish rocket capable of climbing up to the limits of stratospheric balloons for 45 years. It is also a breakthrough, as it is the first rocket in the world to use hydrogen peroxide in excess of 98%.

The ILR-33 is capable of achieving a speed of 1.2 km / s. This is a two-stage construction. Two strap-on boosters for solid propulsion are performed on the first component. The second component is equipped with a hybrid engine whose fuel is polyethylene, and the already mentioned hydrogen peroxide has an extremely high concentration of hydrogen peroxide.

Construction work lasted three years. Engine tests took place on the premises of the modern aviation institute. The team that created ""Amber"" has about 30 young people. Some of them are derived from the Warsaw University of Technology Students' College Space, where they developed their skills under the supervision of Professor Piotr Wola≈Ñski, the chief intercessor and ""good spirit"" of the whole project. Some of those who collaborated on the rocket project have had experience with ESA projects, while others have worked in Western space companies.

It is not easy to build such a team. This team should be preserved in its entirety and maintained.

Colonel S≈Çawomir Augustyn, head of the Inspectorate for Implementation of Innovative Defense Technologies
According to Colonel S≈Çawomir Augustyn, it is extremely important now to provide stable funding for further work by the IL team. Funds may in his opinion come, among others. NCBiR and European Space Agency projects. Further development of the missile system in Poland is also possible under the offset programs such as Narew, Wisla or Lobster.

Successful attempt of ""Amber"" rocket took place on October 22nd. on the grounds of the polygraph in Drawsko Pomorskie.

Different possibilities

Professor Wola≈Ñski argued during the conference that in the construction of small missiles we should comprehensively develop Polish technologies, which is in line with the plan of Deputy Prime Minister Morawiecki. In this way we build our independence.



This rocket and many others are an example of a proper approach to using our resources for technology development.

prof. Piotr Wola≈Ñski, chairman of the Polish Space and Satellite Research Committee
Professor Wolanski insisted that the future of the rockets was in front of small rockets. From year to year there will be more and more satellites. Further work on the Polish carrier systems gives hope for a high rate of return on investment, as many missiles are launched each year.

If, on the basis of the technology developed at the Institute of Aviation, not only a suborbital rocket but also a vehicle capable of carrying small loads into orbit, Poland will make an important step towards independence in this matter. It is of utmost importance to be able to launch small satellite platforms for military use in space.



We look closely at projects financed by MON. We cooperate very closely with the Polish Armaments Group. We look at the possibilities of using our technology for anti-aircraft, anti-missile, and ground-based missiles.

MSc. Adam Okni≈Ñski from the team of constructors ILR-33 ""Bursztyn""
Rocket architects also emphasized that the development of national rocket technology is in line with the assumptions of the Polish Space Strategy. This is particularly true for the following specific objectives of this document:

No. 3: Development of capabilities in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãstate security and defense using space technology and satellite techniques.
No. 5: Human resources development for the Polish space sector.
The rocket was built for 15 km. The ceiling was, however, limited by provisions. Because the vehicle is capable of climbing 100 km n.p.m., which constitutes the boundary boundary of the cosmos. So far we have a technology demonstrator. Further development of the project should, however, result in the development of advanced suborbital and carrier rocket technologies in Poland for use in larger national projects, international initiatives and commercial activities.

As far as scientific objectives are concerned, the implementation of the Polish suborbital missile would make it possible to conduct research in microgravity conditions.

Poland had a very weak central government because it had a very large and powerful nobility. Nobles began allying with foreign powers to undermine the authority of their monarch.

2563,"It goes deep into history of our country. Poland has been divided between Germany, Russia and Austria for 123 years, after that we had just 20 years of independence, starting with war against Soviets in 1920, when we stopped them from spreading communism all over war throne Europe, until Nazi invasion in 1939. Not enough time to unify country after 5 generations of germanization/russification, completely different systems of rules and environment in general. 

Then after second world war, the only thing that really united everybody was hate towards Russians, for betraing us first when the war started, exterminating our officers during it and then again during Warsaw uprising in 1944, when they would just wait for Nazis to kill us, so that they didn't have to encounter independent state, but rather ""liberate"" one. 

Communist government was actually trying to unify country, but they were doing it through centralization, which is never a good solution, because it is put on people as a rule to follow instead of encouragement. Secondly, in their view Poland was to be dependent on USSR and as you can guess from all this long prolog I've shared with you above, that was not what people wanted at all. That's way Solidarity happend in Poland.

So it is pretty much just last 27 years when people of Poland form their own state the way they want and can try to erase historical differences between east and west of the country. When it comes to election I belive that infrastructure which has lead to better living standards in the western Poland and big cities, like Warsaw is one of the main factors for people voting more liberal than in the east. It just make sense economically.

To be honest, right now it doesn't look good for us here, politically speaking. Right wing populists use fear of losing independence, one way or another (invasion, resources, economically) to gain support among older generation and young ""patriots"", who are nothing short of facists. As long as EU is not serious enough to share resources and geopolitical strategy as one state, they will always do that. (Not building nord streem for example!). 


If we really want the EU to work as a project, there will need to be some period of time of safety and EDUCATION without yet too much political centralization. 

It has to come from people, the will to unify. In other case the only thing that will ""unify"" them will be hate towards undemocratic central government in Brussel.

Access to resources to energy and food resources.Access to resources2000-2008 china's consumption of metals grew by an average of 16 percent per year in contrast to other countries with 1%. This could lead to competition among countries. When food becomes scarcer in countries with high demand for food this might cause social unrest.
China needs an annual growth of 8 percent to supplement its needs. The downturn is that growth might result social unrest, instability, political violence.Resource nationalism and hard power politics is the two side of a coin. China tries to get raw materials from Africa in exchange of arms. This development could turn the Indian Ocean as flashpoint of future geopolitical strife.
Also, hunger for resources.Security of strategic routes - war could not be turned out.Increased military expenditure every year.
China: fastest growing defense budget. Seems to develop high-tech defenses and air defense.

2596,"That literally makes no sense at all. The capitalist society is very much a supranational phenomenon, there is absolutely no way in which it can be considered a purely domestic matter.

The US' subsidies on the cotton industry don't come out of the kindness of their hearts towards the southerners, they are there so US cotton can have competitive prices against the Brazilian and otherwise international market. The 1929 market crash occurred literally because the US production grew to meet the European demand on goods, which dropped after they rebuilt their industry causing prices to fall and the entire commercial chain to collapse because of it, that's as undomestic as it gets. Countries literally fund, subsidize, provide tax brakes, tax and so on different sectors of the economy largely based on the cost and efficiency of production in their country compared to the rest of the world, not as an isolated thing.

Most of all, markets never work in isolation, there is a global market that sets prices and drives the incentives for where, when and for which good economic growth happens. Saudi Arabia doesn't produce 10.2 million barrels of oil per day because it plans on using them all up domestically. The 47 millions dollars that leave the US in the form of weapons aren't thrown into the sea, they are sold to other countries. All of this makes part of the capitalist model and saying that it is a purely domestical thing is bananas.

Then we go onto neo-colonialism, which you don't seem to understand at all. The basis of colonialism was to acquire territory which would then be exploited by the population in there, the raw materials would be transported back to the metropolis, which would then make manufactured goods and sell them, some of them to back to the colonies. Mercantilism was the policy of closing off the colonies to international markets and forcing them to just commerce with the parent country, this is a primitive form of protectionism and an economic policy of the 17th and 18th centuries, nothing to do with modern economics.

Neocolonialism is just skipping the part where you conquer the land. Just extracting raw goods from undeveloped nations and selling them manufactured goods afterwards. This not only creates a cash flow cycle where the money that leaves the country in the form of wages and service purchasing in by the extraction operation in the undeveloped nation is returned when the population buys the manufactured goods, which also extracts some surplus value generated from the growth of their economy as wages and prices at home are higher, inflating the cost of production and the finished product. This not only creates a status economic subordination but also prevents the industrialization of the developing nation, as any new native company would not be profitable enough and wouldn't have the capital to compete with the foreign one, be it by not being able to access or extract the raw materials or not being able to match the foreign prices at the early stages where the project tends to be in the red and needs to rely on higher prices.

Examples of this are plentiful. European charities giving free clothing/food/other basic goods strategically, preventing local industries from developing to meet their demand keeping the people dependent on foreign products. Some other examples aren't as extreme, like Venezuela extracting crude oil which is then refined and sold back to them by the US or selling arms and encouraging conflicts in order to keep the local economy from developing self sustenance.

I hope that writing this huge rant helped anybody understand that economics isn't such a reductionist definition as the one you gave and hopefully they will go on to read more about this and, I don't know, vote labour or something.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/7ftrz9/romania_1980s_vs_2017/dqfyuo3/,juancarias,1511847051

I love bringing Chine into play. I speak as Serb who is honestly sick of ""perfect"" EU which is fully supporting our president who is actively making Serbia a dictatorship. I dont ask for them to solve Serbian problems but dont act like you love democracy and all for it when it in fact ""We love democracy when we need it"". Russia on other hand is bringing fire to already dry forest. They arent doing much productively but as EU they are giving their best to take us to their side.

Bringing China into play is good for us IMO. In our eyes, China didnt invade almost anyone not like our far neighboor to East and West, they want to invest in infrastructure not in dirty politicians like EU or broken military aircraft like Russia and China gave us visa free status.

And as someone who traveled all over Europe, US, Russia and China, atleast when I say I am from Serbia I dont get ""you are lower than us"" looks from people in China. They were all delightful and wanted to take pictures (like 40 persons asked for pics) while in many EU states I felt so unwanted.

2605,"Iceland seems to been have known as Thule before it was settled by Norse vikings. Historians debate on which island/land was referred to as Thule, but old descriptions of it and sailing routes match Iceland the most in my opinion.

Along came Naddoddur the sailor in late 9th century and seems to have settled the eastern part of Iceland, he gave it the name Sn√¶land (Snowland) after seeing the snowy mountain peaks.

Then there's a theory that a Swedish viking named Gar√∞ar sailed to Iceland and named it Gar√∞arsh√≥lmi after himself.

At that time, I'm sure more and more Norse men had heard about this relatively unsettled island which was located just a bit west of Norway. The Norwegian Fl√≥ki Vilger√∞arson (Hrafna-Fl√≥ki) went along with his two slaves to explore it and apparently they spent a summer somewhere in the Westfjords of Iceland. When winter came along, the legend says that Fl√≥ki climbed on top of a mountain and saw over the fjord (Icelandic historians like to name Vatnsfj√∂r√∞ur, where he would overlook Arnarfj√∂r√∞ur) that was covered in icebergs as far as the eyes could see. That's where Fl√≥ki came up with the name Iceland and that name stuck.  ",Iceland,/r/europe/comments/7fnrms/the_biogeographical_regions_of_europe/dqfoo9t/,Midgardsormur,1511834434

2636,"&gt;Note the presence of France and Germany, which were amongst the most vocal against it in Europe. France got plenty of shit as a result in fact.

&gt;Also, the invasion wasn't a NATO operation.

&gt;There's plenty of criticism of modern US politics even amongst its allies, and even its own populace. If you're not aware of them, that's your problem.

And ? There are dissenting opinions everywhere. There were ones in Nazi Germany too over holocaust, over Hitler leadership over the over... They even tried to assassinate Hitler on a few occassions.

Dissenting opinions mean nothing. For vast majority of the people USA/France/Germany were the good guys in that fight. Despite the fact they lied to even start it. Most people don't care.

&gt;That's not an appeal to emotion, that's a goddamn fact. Commiting a genocide is wrong, full stop. Doesn't matter what the history book says.

But the winning side won't call it a genocide. They'll say it had to be done, they were defending their people, it was justifed.

Case and point, you defending Hiroshima and Nagasaki as not genocide.


&gt;It is supposed that about one and a quarter millions of Armenians were involved, of whom more than half perished. There is no reasonable doubt that this crime was planned and executed for political reasons. The opportunity presented itself for clearing Turkish soil of a Christian race opposed to all Turkish ambitions, cherishing national ambitions that could only be satisfied at the expense of Turkey, and planted geographically between Turkish and Caucasian Moslems.

&gt;Winston Churchill, 1929

&gt;The Armenian horror is an accomplished fact. Its occurrence was largely due to the policy of pacifism this nation has followed for the last four years. The presence of our missionaries, and our failure to go to war, did not prevent the Turks from massacring between half a million and a million Armenians, Syrians, Greeks and Jews -- the overwhelmingly majority being Armenians.

&gt;Theodore Roosevelt, 1918

What does this prove except what I've been saying ? Did Turkey ever suffer any bad consequences from powers that be for commiting that genocide ? Not at all. Apart from some strongly worded letters.

&gt;... No, because a genocide requires a will to destroy a specific group:

&gt;The US wasn't trying to wipe the Japanese off of the face of the earth, they were trying to force the Japanese government to surrender to avoid what would have been a very bloody invasion. You could try to argue that it's a war crime, but a genocide it was not.

&gt;And contrarily to what you're saying, there's plenty of people who argue that the US were wrong in dropping the nukes.

&gt;The United Nations Genocide Convention, which was established in 1948, defines genocide as ""acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group"".

Yeah right... You know Srebrenica is nowadays a genocide. 8k people died at most in estimates. And vast majority of that were military aged men.  30k were evacuated by the same forces that apparently have done that genocide. This isn't even in dispute by any of the sides, there are even video tapes of it.

How many were evacuated from Hiroshima and Nagasaki by american forces ? Did you allow most of the children and women, old people to leave ? 

An estimated 130 000 - 230 000 died at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Mostly civilians. Mostly women and children. 

And yet that is not a genocide. But Srebrenica is. Double standards much ? Or just the case of winners write history ?

And once again. There will always be dissenting opinions it's the nature of humanity.  For most people USA is right to have done it. And that is what is actually being taught to children. That it brought a swift end to the war to minimize casualties. Your average Lebron doesn't care much about it. USA were the good guys, that's what he was taught. And that's what the majority of the population believe.


&gt;Did... Did you just compare the imprisonment of Japanese Americans during WWII with the fucking holocaust?

&gt;ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!

&gt;The fucking nazis didn't just ""imprison people"" based on race, they did far fucking worse than that. Like, I can't believe you just went there. Fucking hell.

oh, americans did worse things too, did you not lynch black people in the open ? 

&gt;And again, there's plenty of criticism of the imprisonment of Japanese Americans during WWII. The US government even recognized that it was wrong and paid reparations to the famillies.

As I said dissenting opinions always exist. What we care and are talking here is how your average american feels. And he feels it's justifed. Because that's what he was taught at school

Same reason why your average Hans would have taught Holocaust was justifed. He was taught it was since he was little. Government can make up excuses for it just like you make up excuses for crimes of USA.

&gt;I've never heard of this, but regardless

This right here is just proving my point.

The crimes of the victors are diminished, the crimes of their losers are exaggerated. 

&gt; No one is saying that this if fucking right. Quite the opposite. 

You seem to think this is a discussion about what is morally right or wrong. It's not. Morally any kind of murder is not right. However it can be justified. That's what USA does for their crimes. That's what Nazi Germany would have done for theirs if they had won. Diminish and justify.

&gt;You seem to be stuck with this idea that the world sees the US as an powerful gentle giant which never does any harm to anyone, but that's completely false. Plenty of people are well aware that the US did some super fucked things. Plenty of people are aware that the US continues to do super fucked up things. No one outside of the US argues that they're perfect, nor does anyone expect them to be.

Most people do see them like that. Most people don't care. They know what they were taught at school and what they learned from hollywood movies which had the ""based on a true story"" in the beggining. That's just humanity for you.

There will always be dissenting opinions, but if they ever held a majority, they wouldn't be dissenting.

As I said Nazis had their own dissenting opinions which wanted to kill Hitler. 

&gt;Just because they were the ""good guys"" at one point in history doesn't mean that they've never done fucked up things in their past or present. But scale and intent matters.

As I said, the crimes of the victors are diminished and justified, the crimes of the losers are exaggerated and oft repeated.

- As you've written, it was part of the Soviet Union 

- Once upon a time, they once had bad blood with the Cossacks 

- To me, they're probably the people you'd go to if you'd wanna learn how to be a good horse rider. They're good horse riders in the U.S and Europe but if you're looking to be a OP horse rider, go to them .

2690,"At present, EU member states are sovereign. They've entered into agreements that allow the EU to act on their behalf, by exercising certain competencies, at the EU level.  However power is devolved from the countries involved to the EU, and can be repatriated by member states.  So that'd be the opposite of say, the UK where sovereignty rests with Parliament, but can be devolved to regional assemblies (or cities etc..).

The EU is essentially unique in the amount of pooled competencies, and the complexity of the legal framework, as well as in having things like the Parliament. But it is still a supranational organisation that has both direct competencies and works on intergovernmental cooperation. And as such, national constitutions, national supreme courts and so on, generally supersede EU rules and courts (and where they come into conflict, there are measures available to bar member states from participation in the EU, but no way of forcing compliance..). National Parliaments/presidencies/whatever are still where legitimacy and sovereignty essentially sit. They choose to lend that to the EU in certain areas, under certain conditions.

At the end of the day, EU member states can terminate the agreements that they are part of, they don't have to declare independence, they can just leave. The UK is showing that at the moment, so yes, member states are sovereign.

However.... The EU is made up of some very complex, deep and broad agreements. Members complying with the rules are significantly restricted in what they can do as nation states in some areas (notably anything to do with the single market &amp; trade.) so whilst they are sovereign, they can't exercise large chunks of that sovereignty as they have lent it to the EU.

Obviously, PSD (currently ruling party) had a pretty good propaganda machine going on. Especially the rural communities were very strongly influenced by propaganda, there were even priests telling people who to vote for.

The opposing parties really need to step up their game to get any chance in the next elections.

What I find sad is that a lot of middle-aged and older people simply gave up the fight. Many of them lived a good part of their lives under the communist regime, where if you voiced your opinion on politics, you risked your freedom, your family, even your life. Other of them simply forgot how bad things were back then, and still argue that things were better back then (the usual arguments are that everyone had a job, and a place to live, and we had a lot of industry; while it is true that after the revolution things turned for the worse, as the entire economy crumbled, and the politic parties were made up of the same communists as before the revolution, in the past few years, especially since we joined the EU, we have gotten hugely better). These people gave up hope of things getting any better, so they simply vote with whoever promises the most, or just don't vote.

I simply wish we could show them how much we progressed in the past years, and that things are getting better. And their vote matters, and not all politicians are the same. I think the best way to show this is by example, and I'm glad there's a new generation of politicians who are fighting for a better country, less corruption, and more transparency.

It's already not being cut. If you knew anything about Bialowieski you would know that it got infested by a woodworm. Infestation will spread and spruce will go almost instinct thanks to EU.

There were maybe few dozens of idiots on the last 11 Nov. march. So what? There was also a communist, antifa march that you probably hven't heard of. We had a bigger marches in the past years, even fights, no one have noticed until Poland became controversial. Freedom of speech is freedom of speech. 

&gt;stream of refugies coming from the Muslim world

We have many foundations, and the government itself helps all the way in Syria. We can't take illegal immigrants in, only because Germany realized they can't have so much workforce. 

You slurred the Polish nation calling our culture ""irrelevant"", why won't you go talk to Czechs, or Hungarians? I bet we are all shitty countries for you, full of idiots, that's why have to be ruled by an outside superpower. Just put us into camps, or forced labour if that's what you really need, cause we are not gonna bend our knees, we could only try to lend a hand for agreement. But there is no discussion with characters like you. You know you talk reality, the only real truth, the morally purest to that.

That's not how you build the European Union. Because of self rightous authoritarian-minded pricks like you this project is falling. Debate with us, instead of giving us the ultimatum, that's what we demand.

You can't even get basic facts right. The rapid industrialization of the Soviet Union was nothing if not impressive, and they pulled it off while being invaded and sabotaged at every opportunity. Meanwhile the US had a ludicrous headstart from the beginning of the 20th century and jumped even further ahead during the world wars as the rest of the world burned. The Soviet Union started faaaaaaaaar behind and it still managed to be a threatening rival to history's greatest superpower for almost half a century. The USSR had plenty of innovation, for example a little gadget called [the mobile phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Kupriyanovich) which you so graciously tout as a capitalist achievement. That the Soviet Union lasted so long while competing with the US alone is enough to prove you wrong.

I said late 20th century.

And yes they were the good guys. At that part of history and for the next 200-300 years.

&gt;Also, the second Gulf War was approved of by absolutely everyone. Absolutely no dissent anywhere, especially not amongst the US' allies.

Now, come on, evil Sadam vs honorable NATO ? This has to be a joke. 


&gt;And no one ever calls the US imperialistic or anything of the kind either. Nope. Never.

They do. They're the bad guys. Commies who lost. Is that not how they're portrayed ?

&gt;Seriously, what a load of crap. And good job dodging the genocide part of my post.

Because it's the most awful logic I've seen in a while, no point in replying to it. You appeal to emotions, nothing else.

Whoever commits a genocide and wins (or gets away with it)... they obviously won't teach that it was a genocide. They'll talk about how they were protecting their people. Cleansing the population of bad apples. Executing criminals. 

Take your pick, it doesn't matter what they use. And that's what you will believe since that's what you were taught. and what the majority of population will believe since that's what they were taught.

Now with internet and mass media it's easier to hear and share dissenting opinions, we'll see how that goes. But nobody in history thought of these tools before or had access to them. History was what was written in the government approved books and taught in government approved schools.

More welfare money won't fix it, special guaranteed school places for a few Roma people per school (which ironically causes them to be further discriminated against) won't fix it, and blaming it all on the individuals with rhetorics such as ""that's how they are"" certainly won't fix it. The only way to fix it is tackling these problems instead of adopting apparently inclusive measures while further increasing the divide with their policies. The truth is the Romani are pretty much still pariah members of society and no one acknowledges this, the Romanians don't because they don't want gypsies to be seen as Romanian citizens and therefore equal in the eyes of ""westerners"" and the politicians don't because they offer easy scapegoats.

**Farming as rocket science - Why American agriculture is different from the European variety** Lexington

BEFORE growing up to become farmers, a startling number of America‚Äôs rural kids are taught how to build rockets. Every year rural skies fill with mini-missiles built by children. The largest fly hundreds of feet, carrying altimeters, parachutes and payloads of eggs. Baseball diamonds are popular launch sites, as are alfalfa fields: the latter tend to be large and, compared with other crops, alfalfa tolerates a fair bit of trampling. All this tinkering and swooshing explains a lot about American farms.

One youth organisation lies behind many thousands of rural rocket launches: the 4-H club (it‚Äôs an acronym, derived from a pledge involving head, heart, hands and health). Among city slickers, 4-H is not well known. Yet its existence and its history reveal a great deal about America‚Äôs distinctive views of farming and food. For many, the name conjures up a single image: a farmer‚Äôs child at a country fair, clad in best blue jeans and cowboy boots, gravely leading livestock round a show-ring. Lots of club members do rear and show animals, it is true: one of the sights of an American summer is watching an 11-year-old at a state fair, guiding a half-tonne steer past 4-H judges.

But 4-H was born to spread hard science as well as to shape character. Some 2m children attend the group‚Äôs clubs and camps, while millions more follow 4-H programmes in schools. A big push is under way to reach more urban children, with schemes such as classroom egg incubators so that eight-year-olds learn that ‚Äúchicken doesn‚Äôt come from McDonald‚Äôs‚Äù. In farm states such as Nebraska, the organisation reaches one child in three. 4-H clubs and camps form the youth wing of a partnership between government and public universities financed by gifts of federal land, dating back to the civil war and set up to transmit new technologies into every county in the union.

Visiting the Nebraska State Fair recently, Lexington toured a pavilion of 4-H projects. Some entries might be found at fairs in many countries: jars of jam, prize-winning vegetables and woodwork (your columnist frankly coveted a Perspex-fronted squirrel-feeding maze). But there was a striking emphasis on science and business, too. Alongside long shelves of model rockets, entries included a display on pig-eye dissection and a statistical analysis of poultry diseases. Eleven-year-old Cale Urmacher, a fourth-generation 4-H member, gave a robotics demonstration. Becca Laub, 16, outlined her plans for a tomato- and fish-farming enterprise and her ambitions to study engineering. People think farmers are uneducated, she scoffed. Her father has an economics degree and uses it to track market trends. Also, thanks to global-positioning gadgetry, one of the family tractors can drive itself, which is ‚Äúpretty cool‚Äù.

Rivals in other lands have sniffy theories about why America, a rich country, is so good at producing cheap food. They paint American farmers as pawns of giant agri-corporations, bullied by market forces to produce genetically modified Frankenfoods. Lexington has not forgotten the face pulled by a French agriculture minister, interviewed during a previous posting to Europe, as he mocked America‚Äôs ‚Äúaseptic‚Äù farm produce.

Foreign rivals are right about the power of market forces in America, but wrong to see its farmers as passive victims. Americans have thought differently about agriculture for a long time‚Äîand not by accident. Settled in a rush of migration, peaking in the 1880s, Nebraska‚Äôs prairies were parcelled out to German, Czech, Danish, Swedish and even Luxemburgish pioneers. From the start the plan was to convert Old World homesteaders to the scientific ways of the New World. As the system developed, Congress sent county agents from universities to teach menfolk modern farming and their wives such skills as tomato-canning. In the 1920s educational trains trundled through the prairies, pulling boxcars of animals and demonstration crops. At each stop, hundreds would gather for public lectures. Older folk resisted such newfangled ideas as planting hybrid corn bought from merchants rather than seedcorn from their own harvests. Enter the 4-H movement, which gave youngsters hybrid seeds to plant, then waited for the shock as children‚Äôs corn outgrew their parents‚Äô. Later youngsters promoted such innovations as computers.

Because America was a new country, argues Greg Ibach, head of agriculture in Nebraska‚Äôs state government, a primary concern was feeding a growing population and moving food large distances. Europeans fussed about appellations and where food came from. Americans ‚Äútreated food as commodities‚Äù.

Be outstanding in your field
Such differences of history and culture have lingering consequences. Almost all the corn and soyabeans grown in America are genetically modified. GM crops are barely tolerated in the European Union. Both America and Europe offer farmers indefensible subsidies, but with different motives. EU taxpayers often pay to keep market forces at bay, preserving practices which may be quaint, green or kindly to animals but which do not turn a profit. American subsidies give farmers an edge in commodity markets, via cheap loans and federally backed crop insurance.

Nebraska, a big beef and corn producer, feels bullish in more ways than one. There is much talk of China‚Äôs meat-craving middle class and a fast-growing global population. Last year farming graduates at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln could pick from multiple job offers. America is ‚Äúcompletely set up‚Äù to supply soaring world demand‚Äîas long as it can keep using GM crops and other technology, says Will Miller, a UNL student who reared enough heifers as a 4-H member to pay his way through college. Not all young farmers are as biotech-keen. 4-H offers organic projects, too (deftly treading a path through the culture wars that dog so many fields in America, including science). But many are just as enterprising. America set out to plant science and capitalism in its farm kids.

&gt;They certainly suggested scenarios that couldn't all happen, and indeed people voted leave for a variety of incompatible reasons (and people vote remain for a range of incompatible reasons too.. turns out there are lots of different reasons why people support and oppose EU membership

&gt;How on earth were they supposed to 'stay'? They weren't and aren't the government. The most prominent person to go after the referendum result was Cameron, and he campaigned for remain

They shouldn't of said anything in the first fucking place should they, but idiots like you believe their bullshit, which makes you an idiot too.
The referendum was him clinging to power, and him thinking that people wouldn't like and be informed.

&gt;I'm not moving any goal posts. But I'd love for you to explain how the various leave campaigners, or even the leave campaign was supposed to take over the government after the referendum..

&gt;No, Parliament asked a simple question, that had a lot of complex implication

There you go, you are not qualified to speak. That is a complex question.

&gt;A simple one can though, happily that's what this was.
You are an idiot.

&gt;The last time we had a referendum on the EEC, people voted to remain in it, this time they didn't, and Parliament decided to follow that advice.

That was interpreted by some European diplomats as a call for the 16 countries to support China‚Äôs position on the disputed South China Sea and other geopolitical issues close to Beijing‚Äôs heart, such as countering the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, and opposing any move by Taiwan toward independence from mainland China.

The potential fruits of Beijing‚Äôs influence became clear last year when the EU debated how to respond to an international court ruling that China‚Äôs claims to maritime rights and resources in the South China Sea were incompatible with international law. According to European diplomats after three days of difficult talks among the EU‚Äôs 28 members, opposition ‚Äî primarily from Hungary and Greece ‚Äî succeeded in weakening the statement to the extent that it did not directly mention China.


The latest flashpoint is an investment screening process proposed by Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, in September on the grounds that the EU needed to ‚Äúprotect its collective security‚Äù. He insisted that acquisitions of key infrastructure projects or military technology companies should only happen ‚Äúin transparency, with scrutiny and debate‚Äù.

The plan reflects a deep division among member states over how open the EU‚Äôs trade policy should be. Countries including Finland, the Netherlands and Portugal have expressed concerns about the EU intervening in an area seen as an exclusive national competence.



But, according to diplomats and policy experts, China‚Äôs lobbying has already proved effective in diluting the proposed review process, which Beijing views as a ‚Äúlittle brother‚Äù to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The CFIUS has blocked several Chinese deals in recent years. The draft European proposal falls short of giving Brussels the power to force countries to block and revise the terms of corporate takeovers. Instead it provides a legal basis for requesting details on takeovers taking place and allows EU institutions to give guidance to member states, say diplomats. 

Jan Gaspers, head of the European China Policy Unit at Merics, a think-tank in Berlin, says some 16+1 nations in the talks sided with China. ‚ÄúOver the summer, several of the 16+1 EU member states already had a hand in watering down what was originally supposed to be a much more ambitious EU investment screening scheme that would have given genuine screening competencies to Brussels,‚Äù he says. 



Some argue that China‚Äôs record in central and eastern Europe has made the need for a review process all the more necessary. Hungary‚Äôs failure to open its section of a $2.9bn, 350km high-speed rail line from Belgrade to Budapest to competitive tender has triggered an investigation by the commission into whether the project violated EU laws.

Other projects in 16+1 countries are also mired in controversy. In Macedonia, the transport and communication ministry has blocked the completion of a China-financed 57km, ‚Ç¨373m highway amid allegations of losses to the state budget of ‚Ç¨155m. The project was financed mainly by a loan from the ExIm Bank of China and executed by Sinohydro, a state-owned Chinese construction company. Montenegro signed an ‚Ç¨800m deal with ExIm Bank in 2014 to finance a road from Bar port to Serbia, even after the International Monetary Fund warned that the loan-based agreement threatened fiscal stability. 

Another concern in some capitals is the potential of 16+1 initiatives to shape future EU votes. The union requires unanimity on most matters of common foreign and security policy, including sanctions ‚Äî effectively giving every member veto power. If the group took on two more EU members, the block of 13 would be enough to defeat EU measures decided under qualified majority voting, which is used in about 80 per cent of legislation.

A diplomat from one of the 16+1 countries defends the group as an ‚Äúeconomic tool‚Äù working with ‚Äúfull transparency‚Äù. ‚ÄúI know there are people who feel uneasy about this,‚Äù the diplomat says. ‚ÄúBut we are saying among the 16+1, and also to the Chinese, that we are a member of the EU and we follow all the common EU positions on China.‚Äù



In Serbia, which is a candidate to join the EU, the lure of China on one side and the tug of the EU on the other is creating a division of loyalties. The threat of an EU screening process could repel the Chinese investment that Serbia requires to develop sufficiently for EU accession, Vladimir Krulj, special economic adviser to Belgrade, wrote in the FT.

Some sceptics acknowledge that the friction over the 16+1 reflects wider tensions in the EU, particularly between some eastern and western member states. Brussels has been in conflict with both Hungary and Poland over claimed breaches of EU rules and values. 

‚ÄúWe should expect China to leverage the 16+1 to pursue its own interests within the EU,‚Äù says Mr Hillman. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs strategic diplomacy: building relations where you have more leverage and applying those new relationships where you have less leverage. If China is winning friends, why wouldn‚Äôt it also influence people?‚Äù



The theory of a ‚ÄúThucydides trap‚Äù holds that when one rising power threatens to displace another, war is almost always the result. But one aspect of China‚Äôs rise thus far has been the extent to which it aims not so much to displace existing power structures but to move in parallel to them, rejecting the theory popularised by Harvard professor Graham Allison.

‚ÄúRight now I would describe the modus vivendi that the world has found as being parallel play,‚Äù said Lawrence Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, earlier this month. ‚ÄúThe west does its thing; China does its thing. Countries get a bunch of money from China and they do it China‚Äôs way. Countries get a bunch of money from us and they do it our way.‚Äù

The 16+1 grouping of 16 central and eastern European countries plus China is a case in point. It does not seek to displace the EU but to establish a structure that is in some senses ‚Äî such as financing and nascent diplomatic cohesion ‚Äî parallel to it. It is far from the only example.

The Beijing-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, for instance, replicates some of the work of the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ‚Äî which unites China with Russia, four Central Asian republics, India and Pakistan ‚Äî overlaps the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union. The Belt and Road initiative, through which China intends to boost commerce with more than 64 countries between Asia and Europe, offers a partial alternative both to the EEU and to Asean, the group of 10 Southeast Asian nations. 

‚ÄúThese are parallel institutions with Beijing at the centre,‚Äù says Jonathan Hillman, director of the Reconnecting Asia Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ‚ÄúUnder both the 16+1 and the Belt and Road, China is the common denominator. To shift from balancing against existing institutions to effectively competing with them, [Beijing] will need to deepen these parallel structures.‚Äù",India,/r/europe/comments/7fwzf6/brussels_rattled_as_china_reaches_out_to_eastern/dqexbvc/,Vollapolla,1511805565

Except that it's not. You obviously don't understand the differences, and that's fine, but it doesn't mean it's fantasy... It's the reality of it, whether you grasp that or not.

Leclerc is a ‚Ç¨9.3M tank. M1A2 is a ‚Ç¨7.5M tank. L2A6 is a ‚Ç¨7M tank. For an international customer like say, Canada, that's 200 Leclercs vs 265 L2A6s, or for a flat order of 200 tanks, thats ‚Ç¨1.86B vs ‚Ç¨1.4B. That's a **massive** difference, and why L2A6s were specifically designed with the export market in mind. 

M1A2s use the AGT1500, which is a multifuel engine. You can feed it jet fuel, diesel, gasoline, maratime diesel... it doesn't give a fuck. It'll take it and burn it and away you go. US specifically chose that engine so that no matter where they are in the world, they can fuel and run them. It's no where near as efficient of an engine as the SACM engine of the Leclerc though, which was a huge deal for France, who wanted their tanks to have the most range possible on the fuel they carry, while the US was cool with having to refuel more often as again it could burn just about anything anyways. 

&gt; You know what all of these are? The exact same fucking problem said in 3 different ways!

Except not even remotely close to being true...

&gt; If, considering that Poland going at a full engagement alone is suicide, we make sure the alliance that supports Poland can use the same parts

3156,"&gt;In the first place, we need to acknowledge that many Protestant Christians (including many Anglicans) do believe that Holy Communion offers them a true participation in Christ‚Äôs Body and Blood. They may not articulate that belief as Catholics or Orthodox would like; but their faith in Christ‚Äôs ‚Äúreal presence in the Eucharist‚Äù is genuine and should not be disparaged or denied.

I guess you can't be denied in the eastern orthodox faith, but i don't know about the oriental orthodoxy.

I was walking a little behind the group and suddenly I see them taking pictures of some shoes at the bank and pictures of themselves beside the shoes, laughing, having a good time.

Not that he didn't deserve what he got. He did. But at the time he was only following orders from someone far worse than him. At the time if you didn't follow orders, you get the bullet and someone else will.

So...fuck anyone who is seeking education then?

&gt;  Less than 20% in Bulgaria support gay marriage. If a significant number of them enter the UK, they could swing our elections against LGBT rights or other issues. 

Use your head. Typically people who don't support LGBT rights are from older generations. Older people are less likely to move to another country because they're already settled in their own. 

And don't you think it would be a good thing for people against LGBT rights to be exposed to those who do? Seeing another point of view could change their minds. Keeping all the hate together just makes it fester.

&gt; Most people in Greece love Russia and hate the USA. If we can vet Greek immigrants, we'd prefer to have more of the minority that don't love Russia.

I personally know greek people and I can't say they have a particularly strong love or hate for either of those countries anymore than others do. I mostly hear about how they dislike Turkey.

&gt; We want to vet French just as much.

Because...?

Well I'm currently living in the UK and I love it here. However if you were in charge of immigration myself and my boyfriend wouldn't be allowed to be here. Between us we have irish, french and romanian citizenship, and neither of us arrived already equipped with degrees and phds. 

We want to stay in the UK. Not to leech whatever is better about the UK than our own countries, but because we legitimately feel at home here. We get on well with the natives, we enjoy the location, its culture and the standard of living is good and affordable. And no we're not sending any money back to our native countries. We are actually contributing to the local economy, and we're not on any benefits.

Unfortunately because of people like you, Brexit has thrown things in the air and the uncertainty has forced us to begin making back-up plans to move to another country. I will likely be able to stay because I have irish citizenship, however we have considered the possibility of the UK's views on foreigners becoming worse when Brexit finally truly begins. So we are making plans in case living here becomes impossible or unpleasant.

The ECB has policies that are optimised for Germany, not the rest of Europe. Italy's issues would exist regardless, but (as my complaint has been about the Euro project since its inception) they are exacerbated if you force them to operate under fiscal policies designed for Germany.

&gt; It has to do so through major economic reforms, especially to its very rigid labor market, just as Ireland so successfully did in the immediate aftermath of the eurozone sovereign debt crisis.

The solution to survive under the ECB/Euro is to force your country to adopt German policies.

In the world of ""Idiocracy"", everyone seems to be mostly fed, healthy, and alive - despite being only half-functional. The air is still breathable and the water in the toilets is clean. 

There is not much inequality, poor and rich seem to share the same moronic bliss; and literally anyone can become a pilot. The education (such as it is) is affordable. The very idea of Costco University is looking less and less ridiculous as the years pass, costs rise, and education quality drops. 

All necessary technology still functions somehow. The robots probably repair each other and make things. The humans might have the important jobs of (1) sitting around and looking important or (2) sometimes kicking the machines to ""fix"" them. 

And so on and so forth. The things seem to be rather good if stagnant. Except for that loss of intelligence; but how often did it make people happy?

3491,"I'd just note, for those of you who don't follow UK politics closely, that this isn't strictly true.

A majority of Scottish residents did vote remain (1.66m remain vs 1.08m leave), but the SNP have had little success in their campaign for a second referendum since then.

At the 2017 elections, the SNP campaigned on indyref 2, and they lost 3/8ths of their parliamentary seats and 1/3rd of their voters.

Remain votes do not appear to have turned into pro-independence votes (which rather makes sense when you consider that the arguments for not leaving the EU can generally be transposed as arguments against Scottish independence, but Scotland is far more integrated with the UK than the UK is with the EU)

Polls since the 2017 GE give the pro-union campaign an average of a 10% lead over the pro-independence campaign, and no poll has shown a lead for independence since sturgeon announced her intention to seek another referendum in march this year.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/7fpbze/this_sweatshirt/dqeecrm/,Rulweylan,1511778214
3492,"&gt; The left doesn't have to ""fuck up"" they have to compete with appeals to emotion that have been used to divide people since civilisation started. ""you are great and the other is evil"" is tough to fight against because facts do not appeal to the emotionally manipulated.

This is what democracy is about: People voting for what they feel is the right way to proceed. People have a feeling immigrants are a drain on the social systems and want parties that follow a sensible migration approach (like Canada or Australia for example, strict migration laws, but welcoming if you comply with those). 

Furthermore, it's not all emotion. Certain statistics support their notion. Look at this for example: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Development_of_activity_rates_for_the_population_aged_20-64,_EU-28,_2008-2016_(%25)_MI17.png

I see no difference between those to descriptions. 

&gt;trying to portray muslims as subhuman animals like some nazi.

To me you're being intellectually dishonest. You have such a narrow understanding of his words that you're missing the meaning of them. 

He's saying that **the more muslim you are, the less human you are**. Let's say he means ""humane"" instead of ""human"" ‚Äì he's not saying that they're less human in the sense that they're animals, but he *is* using the term ""human"" to describe a virtuous person. And he's saying that muslims by definition are the opposite of that. That's an incredibly racist statement.

But apart from that I don't agree that we should read his words as ""humane"" instead of ""human"", because he's saying that a ""full human"" is a condition you can only reach if you stop being a muslim. Even ex-muslims don't qualify as ""full, 100% human"". 

Why is this something you feel like defending? I guess some context goes lost in translation when it comes to his term ""human"", but the point is really the same: *muslims are lesser than others by simply being muslims*.",V√§stmanland,/r/europe/comments/7fpb6a/sweden_democrat_calls_muslims_not_completely_human/dqebhgn/,rytlejon,1511770708

Private firms won‚Äôt go to corrupt countries... what? Course they do. Vietnam, China, Bangladesh, Taiwan? All very corrupt countries, which does fit your anti communist narrative quite nicely in the case of China and Vietnam but not your economic one.

You lived in communism. I get that, my whole family did too. Keep in mind you had to be a party member for a lot of things for stupid reasons. I think you‚Äôll find no distinction between a feudal society‚Äôs elites and the ‚Äòcommunist‚Äô society‚Äôs elites actions after capitalism shows up. It‚Äôs a part of authoriatarian power, not thinking that you need to have a socialist state to transition to a post scarcity society. 

Not a Marxist, sorry. 

I have nothing to argue with you about here. Never did I claim that shortages, famines, so on and so forth did not happen (in previously modernized countries like east Germany for sure had some steps back in that regard). However, what I am not exactly sure what you‚Äôre responding to here. My claim was that corruption will happen because of the prexisting conditions of the society regardless of the economy. I have first hand accounts of how Soviet Azerbaijan compared to post soviet Azerbaijan, the same with Russia and Ukraine. It‚Äôs pretty universal that it‚Äôs not exactly much different except that you need to bribe more, which I‚Äôm not claiming to be the capitalist system at play, actually. I‚Äôm claiming that the fall of the Soviet Union and the instability that came with it caused these things to became worse. 

That may have been true in your case but in my family it didn‚Äôt go that way. Finding a place to live was almost easy in Baku and very cheap. You rented apartments from families already living there and there were no landlords or anything like that. Keep in mind my family wasn‚Äôt exactly high up the chain or anything. They were really poor and couldn‚Äôt afford to bribe anyone. However, the food and other necessities were always cheap and though quality of life was quite low they never had an issue surviving which seems to be the case with your expirence. 

I want to point out that I do believe that the Soviet Union improved and progressed the country more than the Russian Enpire could have ever done, but do not downplay the atrocities committed such as holodomor or general lack of political freedom nor do I believe that the extended eastern bloc was the same in terms of progress. Marxist-Leninist politics really had no place in countries that were already industrialized such as Germany, so it often ended up creating shortages out of pure mismanagement. 

If you want my critiques of capitalism please ask, because it‚Äôs much beyond the scope of the topic of corruption which I‚Äôm not even arguing to be a product of capitalism.",,/r/europe/comments/7fp022/25000_people_protesting_in_bucharest_tonight_26th/dqe8v7q/,FlipierFat,1511764748
3661,"&gt; McD is in many countries

They're devious. They come to your country and sort of try to sell you on this ""American experience"" but everything is localized like a mofo.

On r/thenetherlands there was a topic from some American who visited a McDonalds there wanting to know where the fuck s/he could get ""that sauce""; we always call that sauce ""American sauce"" here; it was so popular they spun it off as a separate sauce you can buy in supermarkets now with an American flag on it but it only exists in the Netherlands. They just commissioned a Dutch condiment company to produce something with a unique identity that would appeal to Dutch people. Like that sauce has completely become the identity of McDonalds and everyone in that topic thought surely you could get that in the US too with McDonalds but nope, not really.

I can kind of respect it; a lot of times American companies try to branch of to a different culture and then suffer bitter losses because they severely underestimate the cultural differences and think everything works the same but McDonalds does their research and completely localizes their menu to make it appeal to the local taste while offering the illusion of some ""authentic American experience"" to them‚Äîgenius.

Rural industries, often cottage industries if not agrarian, contribute little to the Chinese political economy so there isn't much incentive to develop them at the same pace since they can't really be integrated cleanly into a centralised command style economy. Some problems are easier to solve than others. 30 years ago the rural higlands in places like Sichuan or Tibet had nearly 0% electrification, and today it's near 100%. But to sustain the growth of the cities, the agricultural production had to grow to meet certain food quotas which led to a large growth in domestic wastewater in which 90% of rural areas have inadequate facilities.

3697,"&gt; To be fair the classifications of the different types of guns in english is ridiculously arbitrary.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submachine_gun

&gt;A submachine gun (SMG) is a magazine-fed, fully automatic carbine **designed to fire pistol cartridges**.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPSh-41

&gt;The PPSh-41 (pistolet-pulemyot Shpagina; Russian: –ü–∏—Å—Ç–æ–ª–µ—Ç-–ø—É–ª–µ–º—ë—Ç –®–ø–∞–≥–∏–Ω–∞; ""Shpagin machine pistol""); is a Soviet submachine gun designed by Georgy Shpagin as a cheap, reliable, and simplified alternative to the PPD-40. 

I'd buy that the translation might not be direct, but the correct term in English for that weapon really isn't ""machine gun"", as it fires pistol rounds.

&gt;Not everything has to be up to military jargon.

No, but I don't agree that the decision to call a PPSh-41 a machine gun in English was arbitrary.  There's a clear classification for it.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7fpkcw/erika_a_15yearold_girl_a_hungarian_freedom/dqe9fgs/,vokegaf,1511765933

Funny how that goes that when your brain is switched to English-mode you stop making that connection.

3764,"To begin with, it's not just electricity but also gas. As for electricity grids, Europe is largely one massive synchronous grid already but the amount of work still needed is massive.

Iceland and Cyprus are completely isolated. Ireland is on a seperate grid with the UK. A lot of work is still needed to bring the interconnection up, cable after cable going through land and sea, and that requires money.

That being said, if you want to know how badly we can fuck this up, research the North-East Blackout of 2003 and the California Energy Crisis. The administrative and technical work that goes into maintaining the network, let alone building it is massive.

3784,"I found this data and figured I would make a map out of it. I had never heard of ISCED before today, and after learning some about it, ISCED is probably not the best way to measure a country‚Äôs level of education. Here‚Äôs a criticism of using ISCED by WJ Hyland (1989):

&gt;The widespread acceptance of ISCED has made a significant improvement in the collection and analysis of resource data using standard international terminology, but it has not solved the problem. This paper suggests that an adequate solution to the problem does not require any modification of the components of ISCED; it requires a new approach to using ISCED and a revision of some of its guidelines. While pupils can be classified to a unique level of ISCED, resources in general cannot be so classified, nor can they be classified to any pre-determined pattern; they can be classified only to a range, i.e., a set formed from contiguous levels of ISCED (or other classification). The number of items on a classification by range is manageable. When this approach is taken possibilities for analysis and presentation of the data are open; in particular an allocation procedure can be used to attribute certain aspects of resource data (e.g. time, money) to unique ISCED levels, depending on the availability of suitable supplementary data. A key difference from current practices is that the allocation phase is separable from the reporting phase. It is regarded as a process requiring the professional judgement of the analyst.

Perhaps you‚Äôll find this interesting, even if it does not take into account the true quality of education one receives in these countries by reaching various levels of academic achievement! I admittedly did not try very hard to find data for countries that were not in my original data source.

He's making up some sort of scale where on one end you're a perfect human and on the other you're ISIS. He's saying all muslims exist somewhere on this scale[anywhere from perfect human to ISIS].
He's critiquing islam as an ideology and claims he wants to free muslims and wants them to join his party in stead.

Also, I'm not sure if I'm getting this right through Google Translate but are some people seriously losing their shit because the article named her ""Flor""? Her name is probably ""Florina"", ""Florica"", ""Florentina"" or something similar that is quite a common name in Romania, does it make that much of a difference if she (or the way her name sounds) is Spanish? How about taking a deep breath and appreciating how easy it is to adapt certain names of people who were born two time zones away. They seem to think it's some kind of conspiracy to hide the fact that she's Romanian, or rather to ease in the public's kind perception of her by making her name sound like she was from there. 

Also a lot of people seem to be wondering what the nationality of the attackers is, speculating they might be Romanian mafia group - again, how is the nationality of an organised crime group in their country matter that much to some people? I'm glad they'll be investigating the possibility of a mafia being involved there but is getting murdered by the people of the same country as you somehow more bearable for nationalists?

Europe in 1945 was in an awful place with there being no moral paths to take. Obviously I would have liked the Soviets to withdraw and allow all the Governments in exile to retake their places. That would have never happened though so it's pointless considering the possibility. There were only two possible outcomes in 1945 which were leaving Eastern Europe under Soviet control and beginning WW3 early. 

WW3 would have killed millions more and also risked Soviet victory which would have led to Soviet domination in Europe all the way up to France. What you have to weigh up is Puppet Eastern Europe Vs millions of innocent's lives and the potential for defeat. I would argue the correct choice was made in remaining neutral.

Sanctions on Russia could be lifted to keep it in pro-democracy body

8 hours ago

Thorbjorn Jagland: 'The convention and court has been so important for Russian citizens' ¬© Reuters
The Council of Europe, the leading pro-democracy body in the region, is considering lifting sanctions it imposed over Russia‚Äôs aggression in Ukraine for fear Moscow could otherwise pull out ‚Äî dealing a blow to human rights protection.

Moscow is demanding its voting rights be restored in the parliamentary assembly of the council, which oversees the 1949 human rights convention and European Court of Human Rights. Russia was stripped of them over its 2014 annexation of Crimea.

Thorbjorn Jagland, the council‚Äôs secretary-general, is touring European capitals warning of a serious risk that Moscow could withdraw or crash out of the 47-member body unless its demands are met. That would deprive 140m Russians of access to the Strasbourg-based court, where Russia accounts for a third of the caseload.

‚ÄúIt would really be very, very bad if Russia was to leave‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâbecause the convention and court has been so important for Russian citizens,‚Äù Mr Jagland told the FT in an interview. ‚ÄúIt will be a negative development for Europe, because we will have a Europe without Russia. It would be a big step back for Europe.‚Äù

However, Ukraine and its supporters have warned that re-admitting Russia to the council assembly without concessions on Crimea or the conflict in eastern Ukraine would be caving in to blackmail by Moscow.

They say it could set off a chain reaction of weakening sanctions by other bodies, notably the EU. ‚ÄúIt would be the first hole in the wall,‚Äù said one Ukrainian official.

The Council of Europe, which is separate from the EU, along with the human rights convention and ECHR are central pillars of Europe‚Äôs democratic order. Bringing Russia into the council in 1996 was seen as a key achievement of the post-cold war period.

Russia in the summer suspended its annual ‚Ç¨33m payment into the council‚Äôs ‚Ç¨450m budget. It said it would not recognise a new European commissioner on human rights to be elected in January, as long as it has no vote.

Valentina Matviyenko, head of Russia‚Äôs upper chamber and an ally of president Vladimir Putin, warned recently that Moscow might cease complying with European rights court decisions if it could not vote on officials and judges. Russia has already passed a law allowing its constitutional court to exempt it from fulfilling Strasbourg judgments.

Mr Jagland denied rumours that Moscow officials had threatened a pullout in private meetings with him. But he warned that refusing to pay into the budget or implement court judgments could lead to Russia‚Äôs departure on its own or other states‚Äô initiative.

‚ÄúMy understanding is that this may happen,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe big political question is do we want this political development.

‚ÄúNobody wants to give a signal that we accept the annexation of Crimea. It is not about undermining this position of principle. But‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâwe have to keep in perspective: what is our mandate. Our mandate is to protect human rights in Russia and Crimea, or wherever people live on the continent.‚Äù

The former Norwegian prime minister is pressing for dialogue between European ministers and the council‚Äôs assembly on resolving the issue before the assembly decides in January on extending Russia‚Äôs voting ban. Talks are also under way within the parliamentary assembly on restoring Russia‚Äôs voting rights and some leading members have launched procedural moves aimed at allowing this to happen.

Opponents of an unconditional deal with Russia say that it would set a precedent for others accused of backsliding on democracy, such as Hungary and Poland, and for Turkey and Azerbaijan, which have serious disputes with the council. Ankara recently cut its budget payment because of monitoring imposed of Turkey‚Äôs crackdown on government critics after last year‚Äôs failed coup.

Those against an unconditional deal also fears that re-embracing Russia before presidential elections in March would be a gift to Mr Putin.

Ukraine says Russia‚Äôs hints at withdrawal from the human rights body are an empty threat it would never fulfil in reality.

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine‚Äôs ambassador to the council, warned that reconciliation ‚Äúwithout Moscow paying any price will mean that this organisation will discredit itself both in Ukraine and across the region‚Äù.

‚ÄúIf it happens, Ukraine will review our relations with the Council of Europe,‚Äù he added.

Tanya Lokshina of Human Rights Watch in Moscow said that campaigners there were increasingly concerned that Moscow would exit the 47-member body. ‚ÄúThe European court‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâhas been the most successful international protection mechanism‚Äù for rights in Russia, she said. It was the ‚Äúcourt of last resort in a situation when they cannot find justice in domestic courts‚Äù.",,/r/europe/comments/7fqrg0/council_of_europe_chief_fears_moscow_may_quit/dqdrllm/,SuccessfulOperation,1511741232

3970,"&gt;What, you mean to say that Kosovo wasn‚Äôt hostorically unique and divided from the rest ?

Yes, at no point in history was there ever a country called Kosovo. Historically Serbia has full right to it.

If there is no need for a border between the Croats and the Serbs in Krajina why would there be a need for a border beween Croatia and the rest of Yugoslavia. Ultimately the Croats wanted away from Yugoslavia, the Serbs wanted away from Croatia, that is to stay with Yugoslavia. Only one sides wishes were heeded.

I didn¬¥t meant the points in the resolution, but the point of why it was made. I explicitly said that what is inside it is the only thing that matters.

China had its embassy bombed and against any foreign intervention into the conflict, just that they¬¥re smart and patient, and didn¬¥t want to get into conflict with the US just so.

Look, this is where will disagree, but there was no genocide. There was ethnic cleansing and war crimes of all sorts on both sides, but nobody comitted genocide. I wouldn¬¥t consider any of the 4 sides in the 90s guilty of any genocide. I think it¬¥s quite fair of me, considering many of my fellow Serbs would dub things like Oluja genocide, which I won¬¥t.

Second, that¬¥s no excuse really. I no you¬¥re not trying to defend it, but just bringing it up kinda pointless, since you can excuse practically all crimes during those wars like that.

Really, they aren¬¥t being oppressed? Cmon man be real, I¬¥ve no trouble admitting our faults, why do you have such a hard time admitting your¬¥s? 

I remember watching about him on TV, that being maybe 2 years back, with the attack happening some years before that. I could shrug your claims as propaganda too, but I won¬¥t, so be fair.

Even the Russian foreign minister joined the campaign of disinformation and racial hatred. The girl just went to stay with her granny for a few days. She wasn't kidnapped or raped by refugees as the Russians said.

4017,"Iran having missiles capable of hitting Europe or the US, perhaps even nuclear missiles in next decade or so, isn't a good thing but people need to understand their reasoning.

Iran knows that its militarily outmatched by the US/Europe would lose in a straight-up fight, though it could make it extremely painful that may not always be enough to deter a potential war.  And lets make no mistake we are talking a deterrence here, when it comes to a war against the US/Europe Iran has no ability outside of supporting para-militants/terrorists to strike the US or Europe.  Again, in a straight-up fight it would eventually lose and given the hostile nature of current relations a war is something they must consider.  

Missiles and nukes offer a solution to several problems, one the technology is refined they are far cheaper to maintain than conventional military forces.  They also offer the ultimate deterrence against any hostile action designed to destroy their state as it currently exists. This is the old MAD theory, if I'm going down I'm going to take you with me.  There may come a day where a US President, maybe one with orange hair and a bad social media addiction, decides that though the war will be extremely costly it will be worth it to remove Iran as a threat.  

The costs of nuclear/missile development though are obvious, pariah status on the international stage.  This may suit some Iranians, namely the ultra conservatives, just fine but many other Iranians don't want to wall themselves off from the world like North Korea.  Still, survival is the first order of business for any state and there are forces in Iran willing to pay that cost if it makes survival more certain

The trick is to work with the moderate elements of the government and convince enough of them that there is not a great enough risk of a military attack designed at regime change on Iran to make it worthwhile to pay the cost of missile/nuclear development.

So no there's really no chance that Iran would use its missiles to strike Europe of the US unless it was already under attack since any first strike would mean their ultimate destruction.  Still that doesnt mean its not within our interests to work to keep Iran from developing these weapons, if they do so it puts us in an extremely difficult diplomatic pit to climb out of where Iran is locked into a hostile relationship with most of the world.

4047,"I was all for getting rid of Assad at the start, but right now there isn't much left. The right time was in the very beginning when the Syrian armed groups were still mostly moderate. Back then the West funded the FSA, but very cautiously, and only enough to force a stalemate, not a victory. Then the support started going to the radical factions as more radicalised, plus KSA was always funding the radicals from the start, so there was that. 

Bashar Assad may still go, if Iran and Russia are unhappy with him, they may replace him with a different Alawite, it's possible. We'll also see what Assad does after the war.

Calling him 'genocidal' isn't helping your credibility, do you even know what 'genocide' means? Let me help you. It's like what Romania did in my village of Berlintsi, in the Briceni Raion, Northern Moldova, when the bootlicking Romanian fucks moved in and shot all the Jews in the village, rounding them up and linking them up at the village bathhouse, barely missing my half-Jewish maternal grandparents.

&gt;[The parties] recognise the legitimacy of whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the people of Northern Ireland with regard to its status, whether they prefer to continue to support the Union with Great Britain or a sovereign united Ireland.

I don't count paramilitary personnel.....they are not really soldiers. I mean, you can count Police officers there as well in that case.

&gt;Yeah sure, people in Western Europe are so willing to die for balts and poles. Just like they were in 1930s.

What they want or dont want dont really have a meaning here......their countries have signed military agreements of mutual cooperation, and it was these sort of agreements that made many nations in World war 1 to go to war even though they didn't really want to as well. Also , its never the popular opinion among common people that decides whether or not you go to war or not, it's politicians and military generals who decide that (for better or for worse)

&gt;Just like they were in 1930s.

World war 2 differed quite a lot from modern day Europe......first of all, there were 2 nations that invaded Poland and Baltics and Finland from 2 sides at the same time. At the start of the war, both Soviet union and Nazi Germany were regarded as allies, and Western powers couldnt fight them both at the same time. So they wisely choose to only fight Germany, while allying with Soviets (thus leaving Poles and Finns and Balts to their fate). It was a Tactical decision, there was no way Britain and France would fight both (they barely were able to fight of Germans alone). 

Modern day situation is far different. Germans are on the Western side now, as is pretty much the entire Europe. There would be no 2 fronts in this war (not in Europe at least) ",Latvia,/r/europe/comments/7f7803/russias_army_has_upgraded_its_giant_240millimeter/dqdeocf/,angryteabag,1511726892

Most towns have a weekly market with local produce, eg: Vegetables, Fruit, Meat &amp; Cheese. Sometimes called ""Farmer's Markets"", similar to German ""Wochenmarkt"". 

- [Yorkshire Farmer's Market - JPEG] (http://c8.alamy.com/comp/AK1A8N/england-uk-thirsk-market-place-farmers-market-produce-shopping-AK1A8N.jpg)

Some towns are even known as ""Market Towns"", usually due to a long-standing market tradition (100+ years) and a dedicated ""Market Square"" (Marktplatz).

- [Shrewsbury Market Square - JPEG] (http://s0.geograph.org.uk/geophotos/02/67/11/2671182_3d2bc878.jpg)

4304,"&gt;because this is actually interesting and the number you gave are one estimate among about a dozen differents.

If you go back and read my earlier messages, I explicitly point out the differences between the different models. Which you then ignored and claimed that the paper was masterminded by The British. 

&gt; It is also smaller (less than 3.5 vs over 4% of GDP) which is exactly what I said

I said that in the very first message I replied to you, go back and read because apparently you completely forgot. And no, you never claimed 3.5% over 4%. You know how Reddit works, right? You can go back and read what people have said. It's pretty nifty, try it sometime.

I said, at the very beginning, that some models show the UK having the worst impact (WTO only) and some models show the UK-Ireland sharing the biggest impact (FTA).

&gt;for the EU27 on average there are losses of 0.11 to 0.52% of GPD for the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios respectively. These results cumulate over the whole decade until 2030, which means that if the impacts were spread evenly over thes e years, the annual average impact would be of the order of 0.01 to 0.05% of GDP: i.e. the impacts would be insignificant and hardly noticeable at the macro -economic level for the whole EU27 economy.

Holy shit, did you not read the *very* next sentence of what you just quoted? Is that how incompetent you are? 

Let's include the part you either left out immediately after

&gt; This does not exclude that individual sectors, or **some small member states would be more significantly affected**

That is Ireland. Ireland is 'Some smaller member states'

The part you just quoted talked about *as a whole* (I.E From countries to Estonia to Finland, To Greece, Spain, Etc) countries like that will see little impact. Countries like Ireland and Belgium, whom they call out earlier, and who they mention once again in the part you mysteriously left out, will see much greater impact.

&gt;The results for the UK are much larger, where the losses average 1.31 to 4.21% of GDP for the optimistic and pessimist scenarios respectively. Since the ratio of th e UK economy to the EU27 is about 1:5 a disproportionate result in terms of a % of GDP was to be expected. If the absolute loss were of the same size for both sides one would have expected that the loss as a % of GDP should be 'only' five times higher for the UK. But as a % of GDP the average loss for the UK is about ten times higher, or more

Again this is talking about the impact on the whole EU27 Vs the impact on the UK.

We're talking (If you even remember) specifically about Ireland. Ireland and the UK suffer similar impacts as a result of Brexit, as proven by the paper. 


&gt;And yet I was right all along.

You're so stupid it hurts. Your argument was that Ireland would not be impacted by Brexit, and that it was 'The British who need to get real'.

This paper, which you have read and quoted, lines out exactly how the impact on Ireland is extreme. It literally goes to every effort it can to mention that, while the impact on the EU-27 is little, the impact on Ireland alone will be very high.

&gt;OFC The UK is the one that will lose the most. That's the only thing we know for sure.

Well if you had read the paper you would find under certain scenarios and models, Ireland would be one to lose the most. I'm starting to doubt you actually read anything on there.

We are talking about the European Union here. 

The fact that children are being mutilated in the name of God, while no one who can make a difference, actually does something to stop these abuses from happening, goes to show how pathetic our politicians and leaders are. 



Article 3  of Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union:

*Right to the integrity of the person*

**1.Everyone has the right to respect for his or her physical and mental integrity.**


It doesn't say anywhere that freedom of religion gives you the right to mutilate and abuse children. Maybe I'm missing that part?

Of course this dire situation is not altogether surprising. During the civil war the Bosniak President, Alija Izetbegoviƒá openly invited Muslim terrorists to come fight against Christians in Bosnia. Among these terrorists [was Ayman al-Zawahiri, the current leader of Al-Qaeda who ran the local chapter of Al Qaeda in Bosnia].

4557,"As has been shown before, the UK as a whole relies on the EU for trade as much as it relies on the rest of the world.

However, out of the constituent countries, this pattern is only true for England and Wales. Northern Ireland trades mostly with the EU, and in particular with the Republic of Ireland. Two thirds of exports from the EU and about half of imports to the EU are traded with the Republic of Ireland. The economic integration with the Republic of Ireland has risen substantially since the Good Friday Agreement. Since then, there has been a significant increase in cross-border trade, which was mainly driven by the increase in exports from Northern Ireland to the Republic. This improved the Northern Irish trade balance. Ultimately, political stability and cross-border cooperation paid a significant economic ‚Äúdividend‚Äù.

4645,"&gt;mycenaeans were evolved from minoans pretty much

We actually can't know that. The Minoans are pretty much a mystery for anthropologists and historians. We can't read their language, and we don't have any well preserved speciment of a Minoan person to study. We also have many theories about how their culture (and the Bronze age in general) ended, but it's important to stress that it's theories with no clear consensus. And no, the Tsunami probably didn't do it, have you ever been in Knossos? It's rather elevated. A mega Tsunami would reach it, but wouldn't do the kind of damage that we see. 

So apart from Minoan artifacts, they are a complete enigma. Even the name Minoans comes from king Minos from mythology. Which to be fair, is common for the period. We don't know much about Egypt at the time than we do about Minoans.

But there is certainly no evidence at all to link them to the Mycenaean Civilization. The sort of evidence that links the Mycenaean Civilization with Greek societies after it, don't exist in the slightest for Minoans.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/7ffnve/athens_in_1890/dqcs9c0/,Thodor2s,1511691027

The growing far-right presence at Warsaw‚Äôs independence day march has long been a source of concern in Poland. This year, the concern went global.

Within hours of the march through the Polish capital on November 11, images of black-clad marchers carrying xenophobic, white supremacist banners flashed around the world, setting off an international wave of criticism.

Polish leaders condemned the extremist elements, with President Andrzej Duda saying there was ‚Äúno room‚Äù for xenophobia, ‚Äúsick nationalism‚Äù or anti-Semitism in Poland. Prosecutors have launched a probe into the event.

Many of the estimated 60,000 people there had no far-right affiliations, and reports of a banner at the march urging an Islamic holocaust turned out to be false.

However, coming at a time when the far-right is gaining ground across much of Europe, the march raised questions about the strength of extremist groups in a country long seen as the big success story of the EU‚Äôs eastward expansion. It has also stoked fears that fringe ideas may be seeping into the mainstream.

At the centre of the outcry were banners from a section of the march called the ‚Äúblack bloc‚Äù with slogans such as ‚ÄúEurope will be white or be deserted‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhite Europe of brotherly nations‚Äù, and ‚ÄúPure blood, sober mind‚Äù.

Organisers insisted that marchers with such views made up a tiny fraction of the total, and that the event was actually about patriotism. ‚ÄúThe fact that media focused on it is a surprise for us,‚Äù says Krzysztof Bosak, a member of the far-right National Movement and of the association that organised the march. ‚ÄúIt seems like a planned campaign.‚Äù

Tomasz Szczepanski, founder of Niklot, a self-proclaimed neo-pagan nationalist group that marched in the black bloc, says that the ‚Äúpure blood‚Äù message was not a racist motto but an admonition to shun drugs and alcohol, and that the march was ‚Äúmainly a manifestation of national pride‚Äù.

    The strength of Austria‚Äôs far-right resonates far beyond Vienna

But he says that he agrees ‚Äúin principle‚Äù with the ‚ÄúEurope will be white or deserted‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhite Europe of brotherly nations‚Äù banners. ‚ÄúI think national identity isn‚Äôt only a civic identity but also an ethnic one,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why among other things we are against multiculturalism, which we treat as an effort to liquidate European nations.‚Äù

Poland‚Äôs far-right scene is hard to quantify, but observers say the numbers are limited. ‚Äú100,000 is the upper limit,‚Äù says Konrad Jajecznik, an expert on nationalism and ethno politics in central Europe, pointing out that a candidate for the National Movement received 77,600 votes ‚Äî just 0.5 per cent of those cast ‚Äî in the 2015 presidential election.

Radoslaw Markowski, a political science professor at Warsaw‚Äôs SWPS University, says: ‚ÄúThere is a problem, but it‚Äôs still very marginal. In terms of raw numbers not a big issue ‚Äî there are probably several thousand activists.‚Äù

Far-right movements often thrive in times of economic crisis. But one of the oddities of the current strength of the far-right in central Europe ‚Äî far-right parties have recently made gains in Slovakia and the Czech Republic ‚Äî is that it has coincided with a boom.

Instead, far-right groups have benefited from the sense that some people have been ignored or left behind by the region‚Äôs transformation in the wake of the EU‚Äôs eastern expansion, says Grigorij Meseznikov of the Institute for Public Affairs in Bratislava.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about perception,‚Äù he argues. ‚ÄúSome people still feel that there are no politicians who care about them. That something is going wrong in society. And they feel that the real world is different from the way classical politicians are explaining it to them.‚Äù

The far right‚Äôs cause has been further helped by Europe‚Äôs migrant crisis, which sparked fears of a Muslim influx. In reality, very few refugees arrived in the region.

‚ÄúSuddenly central European leaders had to come up with policies for something they had no experience of dealing with,‚Äù says Mr Jajecznik. ‚ÄúThe radicals took advantage, and quickly adopted their anti-minority sentiment to anti-migrant sentiment.‚Äù

The Polish government‚Äôs hardline rhetoric on the threats posed by immigrants has also provided political space for far-right ideas to gain traction, says Rafal Pankowski, from the Never Again Association, a Polish anti-racism group. ‚ÄúThe most important thing is that there is an increased element of legitimacy for their ideology coming from mainstream politics,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere is a sense of triumphalism on the far right.‚Äù

If the far-right is to be tamed, mainstream conservatives need to do more to challenge extremists head on, he argues. ‚ÄúEvery year the far-right presence in the streets through the independence march has become bigger, and nobody really dares to challenge or check it,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd that is the problem: if far-right nationalism is not challenged, it grows.‚Äù

4716,"A border in the sea has already been rejected by the government and will not happen. That leaves just the system in which there is a hard border for goods which Ireland has already said it will veto. Ireland demands that Britain guarantees there will be no hard border before it lets talks move to the next stage. Varadkar says Brexiters didn't think it through, but he must know it is impossible, so why does he then keep insulting the UK for not solving it? If he was honest he would say, ""If the UK wont remain in the customs union I'm going to block a deal and therefore I will be enforcing an even harder border than anyone else wanted"", instead of trying to pin it on the UK.

What makes you think Northern Irish people will be happier to have a border with Britain than with Ireland? Both are unacceptable. What makes you think that the troubles will restart because of a hard border with Ireland, put there by the EU, but wont restart with a hard border with the rest of Britain? You're implying that only Republicans are terrorists.

&gt;Why not?

Because Ireland says so, and you blame the UK.

&gt;Actually it is.

Ok then, let's go through all the solutions methodically:

1. The UK remains. But at least 85.4% voted for Brexit supporting parties in the last election so no. 

2. Ireland leaves with us, but unfortunately Brexit got irrationally linked with Putin and Trump which means the Irish will never go for it even though they should. They don't want to join the EU's army, they dont want a unified tax system, they don't support federalisation, and they don't want Muslim refugees (they've taken far fewer than the UK, yet we're widely criticised for not taking enough), but it's still a definite no.

3. The EU takes away Ireland's veto and makes us agree to the hard border they want to protect their union. Nobody seems to be considering this one. Brexit goes to super majority voting in the European Parliament, it doesn't require unanimity, but the EU decided to give Ireland a veto, so no.

4. The UK installs a virtual border with cameras. Ireland &amp; EU both say it wont work, and they're right. Nobody is still talking about this as a possibility AFAIK, so no.

5. The UK puts a border in the Irish sea, leaving NI in the customs union. Northern Irish wont allow this, and the government doesn't want it either, so no.

6. The EU lets us discuss trade talks before deciding on the Irish border, and all sides come to a mutually beneficial free trade agreement and free movement. Ireland wont allow this, no.

7. No deal. The only scenario possible left.

Did I leave any out?

&gt;And since the Brexit has been fueled by lies, fake news, nationnalism, bigotry etc, you're probably going for it.

There were lies and fake news on all sides. Much of the remain talking points turned out [to be wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBip1COXRqQ). Almost the entire remain argument was economic. Our GDP did not decrease even though remainers predicted recession. Unemployment went down, not up. Wages went up, not down. House prices didn't decline, they went up at a high rate. [They said the stock market would crash immediately after the vote, it's at record highs](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/imf-warns-stock-market-crash-house-price-fall-eu-referendum-brexit). The only prediction that came true was the currency dropping.

Remain was nationalistic too, otherwise they would want to let the entire world join the EU, but it is limited only to European countries. The UK is a union of 4 nations, like the EU is a union of 28. Neither 1 is not nationalistic. There's plenty of bigotry from remainers too. Admitting you voted leave is tough because remainers are so hateful and vitriolic. I don't tell my own family. Leave supporting MPs get extreme abuse online. Young leave voters are especially abused. They get accused of racism and being brainwashed by fake news but the remain voters are brainwashed and terribly uninformed as well. I haven't seen any threats of violence aimed at remainers online, but seen countless aimed at leavers.

In light of what has happened since the vote (politically &amp; economically), the case for leaving is far far stronger than it ever was before; but the anti-brexit propaganda from the media fueled by lies, fake news and bigotry still makes people want to remain!

&gt;Again, your choice, your failure to secure a smooth exit, your country, your future. Just don't blame anyone else but yourself if everything goes to the crapper.

So there's no scenario in which the EU or anyone else will be to blame? If Malta, 0.09% of the EU's population, vetoes a trade deal that the rest of the EU voted in favour of, it will be the UK's fault? You seem to be taking pleasure at the thought of us being punished, it's sadistic. The EU, due to the nature of having 27 competing interests, will never be able to act reasonably on Brexit.",,/r/europe/comments/7eybn0/european_dismay_at_uk_chaos_and_confusion_over/dqcpmxp/,pacifismisevil,1511683651

It is NOT ideological. Their voters, after all, don't really deal with the downsides of mass immigration anyways. It was political to an extent. 

But there is a reason why economic liberals and national conservatives in Germany don't get along dating back to Bismarck, and they were not going to get many CDU voters. The CDU traditionally has positioned itself as the party of ""German Christian Civilization"", and the FDP come from the kulturkampf. Part of the reason why the AfD took many CDU voters was because they failed to live up to what they were associated with.

But it could also be argued that Britain was key by winning the battle of britain and thus keeping a key base for the allies for which they could eventually launch d day.. which in turn would help out the russians as the germans had a big fight on both fronts to focus on. 

They'd sure have had a better chance against the russians if there was no western front to worry about.

And no I didn't surrender my argument, but I just don't think that you can call the invasion a combined operation if there is no cooperation between the two sides besides the agreement to not take each other's part of a certain country, especially if there's such a big time gap between the start of operation of both sides.

How would you feel about a solving the problem that muslim women are not treated as equals by their husbands by spending 90% of your budget in areas where there are just christians?

Now I am not saying we should ignore the issues that men face. I am saying we should treat the problems proportionally. If 30% of the spousal abuse is against men and 70% is against women then we should also spend 30/70 on men/women, not 50/50. The gender distribution is 50/50.

&gt;you can't do is pick the benefits you'd like to keep while leaving the burdens only to the remaining members.

Liechtenstein (an EFTA state) is allowed to cap immigration, so I assume you want them to be kicked out then? How would the UK be leaving burdens on remaining members? We'd still have a high amount of net EU immigration every year, and we'd still be the 2nd or 3rd largest budgetary contributor, the immigration would just be more manageable for us. I really don't see any valid argument against it. Only a few other member states have such a high level of immigration, so who would be burdened by it? Germany might get a few extra immigrants because of it, but if they had a problem with it they could put a reasonable cap on theirs too. 

Eastern European countries would never have joined the EU if it meant they would be receiving 300k EU immigrants a year. They joined the EU because they knew it would be one way traffic, and they'd get all of the benefit of moving wherever they like, while almost no one would want to move to their countries.

I can guarantee if Ireland was receiving 300,000 EU immigrants each year, the EU would make a special rule allowing them to cap it. And if the UK had received a million in one year they'd probably be allowed to cap it too. Only because the UK is already so large, it is expected to be able to handle ~300,000 people a year, and that's not fair.

Haven't won a single invasive war... biggest Empire in human history.

&gt; what makes you think you could get soldiers through the North sea?


I'm gonna go ahead and answer with reality. The reality that Belgium is Belgium and the UK is the UK makes me think that we could get soldiers across the North sea.


&gt; Being on an island is your only strength pretty much


Just gonna ignore our airforce, navy, infantry and SAS. A'ight.


&gt; The Belgian navy alone suffices to keep any infantry from leaving your coasts.


There wouldn't *BE* a Belgian navy when we try to send infantry, that's the entire point. Only France is equal to the UK when it comes to sea power.


&gt; The Belgian navy alone suffices to keep any infantry from leaving your coasts.


I'm sure wreckage at the bottom of the sea would be suffice as deterrent.

Oh no, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, the two greatest European powers.


You're dreaming if you think Benelux could stop the UK from achieving air superiority and sending troops.


&gt; heavily reinforced by the US and NATO. You wouldn't stand a chance.


If the US was on your side, yeah, obviously we'd lose, but somehow I don't think they'd declare war against their biggest investor and closest ally. Political and economic pressure sure.


&gt; I think you heavily understimate a densely-populated country with the largest arms factory in the world.


I'm not underestimating Belgium, I'm just saying you're on crack if you think Belgium stands a chance against a much bigger country with six times its population, six times its GDP and an immensely superior military that focuses on expeditionary capability.


One big factory means absolutely nothing, we'd just bomb it. Our arms industry is way bigger anyway.


&gt; Somehow Belgium survived 2,000 years without a single lasting invasion, the UK has been plundered and pillaged by every town bordering the sea. Look at your bastard of a language and the make-up of your genetics

- Belgium hasn't existed as a country for 2000 years


- The UK has never been plundered or pillaged, it's only 300 years old. England, sure, like 700 years ago. How relevant.



Point is Belgium wouldn't stand a chance in a war against the UK, you're delusional as fuck if you think otherwise.

5232,"&gt; TIL subjects of the Russian Empire/German Ober-Ost command are ""Lithuanian citizens"". It surely must be an interesting experience to be, completely unbeknown to yourself, a citizen of a country that doesn't even exist.

Vilnius was the capital of Lithuania from at least 1323. Some things happened in between but we got it back. You can shove that dribble up you ass.

&gt; ≈ªeligowski's operation was the third time Poland retook the city within those two years. It's like you don't even read anything, just repeat your obviously incorrect babble.

So Poland were backstabbers more than once. Whoop-de-doo.

&gt; Actually, both the 1897 Russian census, and the 1916 German one already show the city as overwhelmingly Polish-Jewish.

You really have no idea how the world works do you. I guess it's okay Crimea got annexed as well because there were a lot of Russian speakers there? 

&gt; And gave it to Lithuania for the second time in 20 years! Russians surely must be your best buddies, it's heartwarming to see such an Eastern European brotherhood.

It really does show what a shit ally Poland turned out to be doesn't it? :)

&gt; Didn't Soviet Union dissolve 25 years ago already though? Because they are the only entity we ever lost this city to in 20th century (and on three separate occasions nevertheless!). It surely must have been an important place for Soviets if they wanted a Polish-majority city this much.

I thought you knew history. What you said here is retarded. Read up about why Russia gave it back to Lithuania.

&gt; Giving away the closest thing to war reparations we ever got from Germany? The price we receive for that better be worth it.

So which is it? Is it war reparations or were those Polish territories? Because it can't be both. 

&gt; Considering that Lithuanians seem to be rather unashamed about the ethnic cleansing they did to Wilno, it apparently feels quite well.

we can not deny that there were violence in the early 1920s, but that period was remembered in Italy as a period of anarchy and civil war, so the government condemned violence against the slave population for the sake of having greater dangers at the moment, the Italian politics of wickedness in its being is no different from any cultural assimilation policy practiced in Europe since the mid-1800s to give you examples at the moment I can say the Russification policy in Baltic and the French attempt to eliminate linguistic minorities in their own country, which justifies it? no was a horrible crime for which the Italian government has apologized since the 1950s.
for the phrase dictated by Musolini it can not be denied that he and other Fascist Party members were fanatics but luckily in a period of peace it would have been impossible to implement Elimination policies  (unfortunately we can not say the same as ww2 but fortunately men like Ciano and other fascist hierarchs did not like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa genocide and managed to alleviate the suffering of occupied populations as far as they could without being shot for betrayal) the mere fact that BN, as opposed to other contemporary dictators, had risen to power by allied with the various right-wing political forces that would have prevented this project (the Catholic Church in the first place) and if you carefully watch the program drawn up by the fascists at their birth that you implemented you can notice a drastic change.
To complete the Italian policy of slave minorities were brutal but not different from those of other contemporary nations (I repeat that is not an excuse).
However, I would like you to reflect on the events that followed the annexation of the Histria to Yugoslavia, even though the Italians were quite poisoned, they did not dare to carry out an ethnic cleansing of the magnitude applied by Tito (this was also done against some Serbian and Croatian minorities) from the 30,000 to the 40,000 Italians killed in the foibe, including many of the partisans of the CLNAI who had fought a while ago with the Yugoslavs against the Germans, and the exodus of over 350,000 other Italians (and a small number of Slavs) who abandoned places they had inhabited for millennia and the destruction of the Italic culture of the place (for example, they removed the coat of arms of Saint Mark from cities that were ancient Venetian colonies). you are accused and accused but if the Italian government does acts that can be called unjust you can not accuse Tito and all those who follow him to be true monsters.
I hope you can read everything if you are interested in the exodus of Istrian and Dalmatian people. I suggest you read ""Foibe, the last witness"".",Italy,/r/europe/comments/7f6h15/ww1_french_made_entente_flag_a_one_of_a_kind/dqc15yd/,luca097,1511647595

As we know, Europe is moving at full speed, and we all see it every day by looking at growth data, unemployment figures, industrial production statistics and a thousand other indicators which tell us that our continent, at least from an economic point of view, has never fared so well - at the end of the year, the consecutive quarters of growth will be 18, yes, 18. But when our camera moves away from the general (and economic) framework to the particular (and political) one, the image of Europe changes radically and appears as a set of tesserae of a mosaic with some problems.


As we have seen in Germany, Europe's most powerful politician still fails to form a government two months after the elections. In Spain, one of the best performing countries in Europe, as we have seen, the government is fragile and is unable to keep under its control a fanatic who illegally declares the independence of a region. In the Netherlands, a country that is growing at a rate of 3% per annum, twice as fast as Italy, the government only came into being after two hundred and eighty-one days of discussions.


**A chain of French conquests**


In Europe, there is all this (and who knows what else will be), and then there is an oasis of happiness called France. Where not only are the populists not winning (they do not win on any side), but where the stars have magically aligned themselves, for the benefit of a country that has no problems of stability, no governability, no leadership and which, thanks to a system that manages to gather in favour of something and not only against someone, is beginning to reap the fruits of its formidable soft power. Two days ago, there was the conquest of the seat of the EBA, the European Banking Authority, which left the United Kingdom, a victory wrested from Germany. And before that, the conquest of Unesco's leadership (with former minister Audrey Azoulay), the conquest of the 2024 Olympic Games (in Paris, with all our thoughts for[the mayor of Rome] Virginia Raggi), the conquest of the 2023 Rugby World Cup (a significant year, that of the bicentenary of the invention of this sport) and, tomorrow, who knows how the game of chess will end.


**European finance goes to Paris**


In Europe, in recent years we have learned to understand what works and what doesn't work, what works and what doesn't, what threatens the continent and what saves it, what stimulates growth and what hinders it. But many observers - and not only in Italy - often forget that, apart from the directions to be avoided (soverainism, populism, nationalism), there is one that should be followed, and which today is indisputably that of France. France is today a small miracle, not because the stars have aligned themselves miraculously, but because those who direct it are reaping the fruits of a system that could only find in Emmanuel Macron, 39 years old, a worthy heir to Charles de Gaulle. The French model works because France, since 1958, has chosen to rely on a system that makes it possible to govern fragmentation and prevents fragmentation from governing the country (""How to govern a country that has 246 varieties of cheese?""). And the fruits of this model may never have been as tasty as they are today. As the German case shows, even the world's most robust systems, without making strong corrections to simplify the policy framework by stimulating competition, do not find a way to avoid fragmentation governing the country. But, in addition to the technical data, there are also political data that must be considered, and that anyone observing the Macron phenomenon without blinkers cannot fail to recognise.


**The need for a strong leader**


Macron France does not only function thanks to de Gaulle, it functions because the system built by de Gaulle (a President of the Republic directly elected during a two-round ballot) has allowed the maturation of a strong leadership able to synthesize the spirit of the times and above all to govern over time. In 1958, de Gaulle's enemies were convinced that the French constitutional reform was the first step towards authoritarian drift (this was what his opponents in France thought, and this was what Communists throughout Europe, notably the secretary of the Italian Communist Party Palmiro Togliatti, thought).


But in reality, as demonstrated by Macron's formidable career path (there was also a Macron in Italy and, on November 21, our own Macron, Renzi, was visiting Macron, but the Tog line, which is the only one of its kind in the world, was not the only one.","Hey kid, wanna buy some rafales ?",/r/europe/comments/7fhkai/translation_in_comments_seen_from_italy_why/dqbv2ha/,Floyddit,1511640054

Czech law imposes some restrictions, like clear criminal record for people directing the organization, absence of profits etc, but that's it. Of course unofficial control is still possible (""do that or you'll get no donations next year""), but it's equally possible that the head of the NGO has his own bugs and will act accordingly.

But labelling this legitimate criticism of the use of EU funds as a myth on the basis that the article doesn't list every other project funded under the program is absurd.

5318,"There's purchasing-power-parity to consider here as well though: setting up a troll farm 50km outside St Petersburg might cost you $50k a month, salaries included, for a half-dozen people and an office, plus whatever technology assets they need. That same operation in Bonn or Lyon or Brussels will take 3-5x more cash just because the people, rent, and consumables cost more. 

Then you factor in the asymmetry of the troll farm not having to be concerned with truth; they can make shit up all day and a/b test until they get something good. Conversely your anti-propoganda unit has to be telling the truth (or something close to it) so their output has to be of much higher quality - the staffers for it need to essentially be trained journalists as well as everything else. On the other hand, telling the truth does have the advantage of then being able to point to reality as your ultimate arbiter of fact (which is why the popular strategy of the modern troll and propogandist is to use whataboutism and other non-fact-based derailing tactics rather than straight lies) 

Making propoganda is essentially a very cheap operation now, but it's only partially a permanent measure - you have to keep the tide of fake news flowing, and make sure it blankets everywhere. Countering it, on the other hand, is about developing a social immunity (which is long-lived) - teaching people to critically evaluate the things they're told. So a relatively small budget anti-propoganda unit can have disproportionate impact by being very good; whereas there's essentially a quality ceiling on fake news beyond which you only see major gains from quantity, not quality, improvement.

Because it's improving everywhere. That's what's so ridiculous about the Fidesz-love and MSZP-hate: it's all circumstantial.

As for who to replace them: at this point I'd be the happiest with a technical government √° la Bajnai under the auspices of the coalition of the newer parties. But since the nearest realistic date Fidesz could see a loss is 2022, they could also grow and LMP could sort out its internal issues.

From the US. It was smart to sell the land to the US rather than lose it in a war later on. 

&gt;I agree with you France neglected it's colonies, probably because being poorer/less hospitable they had very low populations comparatively, and because as a continental country France couldn't project military strength overseas the way England could.

Louisiana was no less hospitable than the British colonies, as later US colonisation showed. France did develope first all along the Mississippi watershed and were they so inclined they could've transformed those forts into cities with an influx on population. 

They didn't, partly because they needed their population to defend their borders and partly because their culture was different.

That's the problem.  At the time that the decision was made, there was a ""right"" and a ""wrong"" opinion.

&gt;A subset of them does indeed hold reactionary views though, and it is legitimate to call them out for it

I absolutely agree with this.

&gt;and it is also legitimate to demand voters to distinguish themselves from them

I'm sure a lot of their voters wish they could distinguish themselves from the parts of the party that are truly racist.

That is a fine educational video. It does *not* demand any change to Zwarte Piet: it simply asks not to use ""Zwarte Piet"" to tease or insult black people. Which is completely justified and is not an overreaction. Black people shouldn't be called monkeys either, but that doesn't mean we're going to ban monkeys from the public eye either.

In fact, it shows how Zwarte Piet can be an excellent opportunity to teach children not to put people in the same group because they share one superficial but eyecatching characteristic.

5615,"Destabilization of the West and thereby a return to superpower status for Russia. Putin considers the downfall of the Soviet Union to be the ""greatest catastrophe of the 20th century"" and does everything in his power to return Russia to former glory, albeit this time not as a Communist, but a far-right nationalist regime.

Russia's economy is comically small, smaller than Italy's. Their manufacturing sector is a joke and most of the state income relies on the sale of raw goods like minerals and oil. Corruption is rampant, infrastructure lacking. This economy could never keep up with the EU or America and is rapidly falling behind. A small economy can not sustain a large modern military, like the one the Soviet Union had.

Putin is doing two things: He is downscaling and modernizing the military so that he can effectively use it for expansionist adventures like Ukraine (which kindle the fire of nationalism he needs for domestic support and to distract from serious domestic issues) and at the same time he is using cyber and information warfare to make up for military shortcomings. It's worth mentioning that the sole leftover from the Soviet Union in terms of superpower status is the nuclear arsenal, which is Putin's last and most potent tool of intimidation.

Back to cyber and information warfare. Here's the deal: It's comically inexpensive compared to battleships, aircraft and tanks. A country needs TV stations anyway, so why not use them to your advantage, boost their funding a little so that they can influence foreign nations (see: RT, Sputnik). Start with seemingly critical, but objective journalism that is perhaps a bit more bold and outspoken than Western journalists and slowly begin the inclusion of lies and propaganda. That's how they almost got me. Then pay a few thousand people with foreign language skills to change the narrative in the comment sections of newspapers and online videos. Send them to the forums, provide them with talking points, multiple accounts and believable cover stories. This has become absolutely rampant. Some websites of newspapers in Germany were so overwhelmed by this massive influx of comments (suddenly, four or five times as many comments as normally were under each article, all of them aggressively pushing the Russian narrative) that they closed comment sections entirely. These paid trolls come out in numbers that overwhelm most online communities and they are getting better and better. They aggressively campaigned in favor of Brexit, they support far right political parties and their xenophobic positions in Europe in America (in addition to pretty open official loans and the likes from Russian banks to these parties and organizations), they support Trump and at the same time massively stirred up support for third party candidates in the US, assuming (correctly) that these votes would harm Clinton the most, who, unlike Trump, would be able to counter Russian foreign policy effectively.

Russia wants weak leaders they have leverage on, like Trump. They want less democracy, less information, less civil liberties, more race conflicts, more xenophobia, because all of these things weaken the West, drag it down so that Russia seems stronger by comparison and can act more and more brazenly. By overwhelming social networks and news with fake news, they create a general distrust in news media and democratic leadership, which also means that their propaganda and leadership will appear less bad, because everything seems bad all of a sudden. This in turn fuels political apathy and disinterest, helping far right movements and parties who can mobilize their followers effectively, thereby again strengthening forces that weaken the West and its principles.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/7fdbzd/eu_antipropaganda_unit_gets_1m_a_year_to_counter/dqbeldr/,DdCno1,1511618526

5707,"Real life capitalism comes in plenty of varieties, some with more influence for workers, some with less, some with a larger role of the state, some with a smaller one. A famous book on this is [Varieties of Capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varieties_of_Capitalism) by Hall and Soskice, who distinguish between liberal market economies and coordinated market economies based on their respective production systems (explanation in the link). Some other people have later added Mixed Market Economies or, alternatively, State-led Market Economies, referring mostly to Southern Europe, to this typology.

Another frequently used typology is Esping-Andersen's [Worlds of Welfare Capitalism ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Worlds_of_Welfare_Capitalism), which distinguishes states based on the organisation of their labour market and welfare systems. The  ultimate concept which these are based on is 'decommodification', which is the extent to which the welfare system reduces the dependency of individuals on the market.  Esping-Andersen described three possible 'worlds' (also in the link), but other researchers have proposed multiple more possible ideal types of 'worlds of welfare capitalism', such as the Mediterranean family-based welfare capitalism and the Eastern European system, though I'm less familiar with how the latter works.

Like I said, because they helped to create an environment in which it was -and basically is- forbidden to think any different than the state proclaimes. That this creates a negativ feedback loop where everyone with an extreme worldview flock to these parties is only natural. This is not healthy in my opinion since you disregard a rather large portion of the population and if they feel that they are not politicly represented than they will either get more extreme in their views or drop out of the political discussion which can't be a goal in a democracy.

5836,"&gt;Unlike the Kosovar Albanians, there's no equivalent Catalan country to go to -- Andorra doesn't have the space for half the people of Catalonia who want out. 

The fact that you think this would even be possible shows how ignorant you are on the matter.

&gt;Yes, and that is **precisely** why the indepedence movement won. I am a resident of Barcelona, a foreigner (Dutch), and one who was (rudely, I might add) awoken at the 1^st at 4 in the morning, along with my wife, at the 1^st of October, in a case of mistaken identity, roughed up a little -- nothing permanent, but it did cause the wife to take the child out of the country for the rest of the year, and then sent back. When they boarded their flight back to her native United States, that moment is when I became pro-independence. 
&gt;
&gt;Never again, did I want to see the look of sheer horror on my wife's face. Never again, do I want to see her shedding a tear. I see it as my duty, my solemn vow, to have her cry less than she did when we weren't married.

Either you are a liar (99% convinced specially with that username) or your wife is not a genius. The only way to be beaten is to go to stop the police from stopping an illegal act that is taking place. There is no way anyone thinks that their kid is in danger in Catalonia unless the kid is used as a meat shield to stop the police from entering/exiting a building, if that is the case then the kid is actually in danger from her mother.

You're technically not banned from the other countries but you're also unable to travel to them. 

Unless I guess you can successfully argue that the ban is unwarranted and there is a strong and immediate need for you to get into a certain country, in which case you might be awarded a visa limited to that country, but you will still be banned from the original country.

The point is that if you are banned from Poland (for example), and France lets you in, unless they have 24/7 surveillance on you, you are basically able to roam everywhere in Schengen, including Poland, because there are no border checks for anyone.

Thus the only way for a member country to prevent someone from getting in is to deny them access to the whole Schengen Zone. 

You might disagree, but these are still sovereign countries with the right to prevent people entering. It may sound unfair, but it's very rare to have someone banned and usually for good reason, anyway why would France or Italy or Slovenia want Poland's rejects?

5872,"&gt; With this threshold in mind, the vast differences between Kosovo and Catalonia become clear. The Albanian population in Kosovo experienced racist repression under Slobodan Milosevic‚Äôs rule during the 1990s as Yugoslavia was disintegrating. This culminated in a war in which Yugoslav forces killed more than 10,000 Kosovo Albanians. When NATO started its bombing campaign in 1999, Belgrade deliberately expelled close to a million Kosovo Albanians ‚Äì half the population ‚Äì to neighbouring countries. 

While I want in no way to minimise the Kosovo Albanian suffering, there is a fault in this article's reasoning.

The NATO military intervention in favour of independent Kosovo happened **before** most of the crimes took place. The decision to intervene militarily followed after several hundred military and civilian victims on both sides (mostly Albanian).

So the difference is not as great as the article implies.

Is that your ""morality"" which you stress in the last sentence? There is good separations and bad separations. Ossetia, Kosovo, [I infer...Tibet...]: Good. [I infer...Scotland,...] Catalunya: Bad. - If so, then please explain: Catalan secessionists compared their situation with Slovenia, which was quickly recognized by Germany. EU countries, including Spain, to follow suit. Why exactly was this a good separation with high morality? **Which crimes** happened in Slovenia to apply your justification to this fast and smooth breakaway?  And **Whose crimes** came first in your example Kosovo? I cite from the book ""Rouge State"" by William Blum: 

&gt; Perhaps the strangest aspect of the whole conflict is the collective amnesia that appears to have afflicted countless intelligent, well-meaning people, who are convinced that the US/NATO bombing took place after the mass forced deportation of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo was well underway; which is to say that the bombing was launched to stop this ""ethnic cleansing"". In actuality, the systematic forced deportations of large numbers of people did not begin until a few days after the bombing began, and was clearly a reaction to it, born of extreme anger and powerlessness.

5978,"It's kind of funny how the word ""propaganda"" has shifted in meaning to essentially ""propaganda I don't like"". It is literally Latin for ""those things which are to be propagated""

Wiktionary gives as definition:

&gt; A concerted set of messages aimed at influencing the opinions or behavior of large numbers of people.

But nowadays it just seems to mean ""influence in a way I don't like"".

Similar to how ""dogma"" in vernacular usage seems to nowadays mean ""dogma I don't agree with"", virtually no one would call anything they say themselves a dogma except various religious bodies who still use the term dogma in the original meaning. A dogma is just a statement held self-evidently truthful with no further argument given and is as far as logical reasoning goes identical to an axiom.

Saying ""You should take good care of your children"" in theory is a dogma but almost no one would use it like that. Kind of like how ""terrorist"" is only used for ""terrorist who fights for a cause I disagree with"" I wonder if that semantic shift happened as late as 9/11 because when you watch DS9, a 90s TV show you can see a lot of people in it seemingly without any negative judgement on themselves calling themselves terrorists speaking about their military tactics of creating terror and confusion for the goal of liberating their home planet.
