3,"Terms and conditions have been challenging on the grounds that they weren't contracts multiple times and the courts always ruled that they weren't. Even if they were, most contracts don't have a clause regarding your death. Doesn't matter, because inheritance law uses the concept of legal successors. Your heirs become you for the purposes of a contract with a very, very small list of exemptions (eg If your famous painter uncle dies before finishing some contract work you don't get to hand in your best attempt and demand payment)

If you want to argue here, consider that an actual court made a ruling here and that your opinion on how the law should work doesn't really count for much.

If you want to make sure no one reads your stuff, put it in your will. If you really want to make sure, use encryption. If you really, really want to make sure, don't use the Internet.

Where were the decades of oppression of Spaniards by native Americans? Where were the decades of oppression of Iraqis by Kurds? Where were the decades of Ukrainian oppression of Russians? Where were the decades of oppression of Germans by Jews? Although that might be a bad example given the Ukrainians love of Nazism. 

The Poles recived the same if not worse treatment from the Prussians than the Ukranians did form Poles. They did not resort to such acts.  

THe Poles recived the same if not worse treatment from the Russians than Ukranians did under Poles. They did not resort to such violence 

The Estonians recived the same if not worse treatments from the Soviets than the Ukranina did from Poles. They did not resort to such violence. 

THey created the singing revolution.

The Ukranians didnt do this because they felt opressed. Many people have been opressed in History and did not do this. THe Ukranians did this because they had barbaric morals.

Dont pretend like its Warsaws fault

70,"&gt;Come 1989 and the collapse of Potsdam Europe, Nato did not approach a broken Russia to agree some new settlement. It did the opposite. To protests from Russia’s weakened leader, Boris Yeltsin, it gathered former Warsaw Pact states under its wing and advanced its border east towards Russia. It embraced Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, then the Baltic states, Romania and Bulgaria. It was like Khrushchev stationing missiles in Cuba.

Author didn't explained why is Russia bussines in which alliance we ( eastern european)  are.  I am all ears if he decide to write another article. 


&gt; But the current tit-for-tat hostilities with Russia are playing with fire, and counterproductive. Europe’s land forces are so weak they would be wiped out by Russia in a matter of days.

The Prague Spring did not start suddenly, but it was a process that was kicked earlier in that decade, which culminated in 1968. People could travel to West without restriction in 1966; media, art, culture, and publishing was relaxed. Masses of scientists and engineers could work freely without the oversight by the communist appointed apparatchik to develop and produce numerous technologically advanced goods and products; especially in the field of engineering, machinery, chemistry, material science, and optics. Novotny underestimated the influence of the culture and media, but he cared that Czechoslovak industry prospered and its factories delivered solid output. The relative prosperity was gone after 1968, when 250.000 fled in a matter of 14 months and many of these people were engineers and scientists, who did not want to work in the country under the Soviet control. Furthermore, purges eliminated many skilled people, and the industrial potential suffered. The quality of the production went down.

132,"The first paragraph is all true.

But we are still a bit closer than this post suggests. For starters, the state of Duklja in the region of modern Montenegro was *the* major Serb state for some time during the High Middle Ages. The theocratic ruler of independent Montenegro was, organizationally speaking, a cleric of the Serbian Orthodox Church.. The repertoire of the *guslar* traveling bards, characteristic of Montenegrin culture, included even at the time numerous songs about Serbia Proper ruled by the Nemanjic dynasty, and the battles of the earlier Serbian Despotate against the Ottomans.

Since the very beginning of the emergence of a strong Serbian independent state in the 19th century, unionist sentiment was apparent in montenegro. At the start of WWI and at the referendum afterwards, the two blocs in Montenegro were for complete annexation with Serbia (the majority amongst the lower classes), and for confederation with Serbia (the majority in the capital and amongst the ruling classes). Complete independence was not a relevant possibility, since ""Montenegrin"" was a regional identity of ""Serb"" and this was the time of pan-Slavic nationalism. [At the time, the Montenegrin monarchy was seen as an outdated anti-democratic construct keeping Serbs in Montenegro apart from Serbs in Serbia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podgorica_Assembly#Election)

Yugoslavia is another matter. I've long ago learned that this conversation won't go anywhere, but the fact is that, while the indignation of the other republics at a lack of influence in the central government is partially justified, turning this on Serbs is a bit of a flawed approach, given that this was a truth of Yugoslav organization well before the nationalist wave in the mid-80s, and the strict anti-nationalist policies of the Communists before the mid-80s were applied to us as well. The centralization is, in my view, clearly and explicitly a fault of Titoist doctrine more than Serbian chauvinism. I have also heard plenty of anecdotal evidence of unspoken ""affirmative-action"" policies, of a sort, which were active in that time to encourage the success of other ethnicities in education and employment in Serbia (outside of the Serbian League of Communists itself); while this fits with Communist ideology I don't have sources and so won't attempt to use this as a real argument.

The last paragraph is simply awful. We have gun ownership but not a gun culture, America's global imperialism is vaguely comparable but of a different character and scale than our regional irredentism, and in any case similarity of culture doesn't count for shit when national rivalries are in question, no matter the level of rivalry (see: Ukraine/Russia,  more broadly much of EE, Rwanda, Wallonia/Flanders, East Asia, Indian Hindus / Muslims).","Vranje, Serbia",/r/europe/comments/8ycrsa/western_balkans_predominant_ethnic_groups_in_1990/e2aqhyv/,TwoSquareClocks,1531452635

Loyalist Paramilitary =1020 (29%)
British Security Forces= 362 (10%)

1) Happened around a century before ww2.

2) It was more a result of negligence rather than outright intention to kill off a large part of the population.

3) Although not the same extent, famines were somewhat common at the time. Norway suffered a famine in 1809 and in 1814 (our last) for example. 

4) The result of ww2 were more than 50 million casualties (although that was not only due to Germanys actions) of which around 17 million died in the Holocaust. Many cities in both Europe and Asia had to be re-built from the ground up.

5) Voting was a lot more restricted in the UK before the famine than in Germany before Hitler, hence we can say that the later was more of a true reflection of the populations will at the time.

&gt;You didn't suffer this, so why are you judging the Irish ?

The whole conversation started actually from a comment saying that (I'm paraphrasing) ""you would have felt the same had you been occupied by a foreign power too"" and I am saying I don't despite Norway being in that situation. I am judging the Irish because I was basically asked to do it. 

&gt;Put yourself in their perspective, create in your mind an alternative world where the Swedish did this to you and wonder if in that world you wouldn't also not support the swedish in sports.

The issue here is not they aren't *supporting* them though but that they are actively wanting them to lose. And I've tried to put myself in their chose but I genuinely can not understand why they would feel that strongly about things that happened an century ago. 

There is a lot of things I could bring up from the past too if I really wanted. For example as far as I know Norway have never received an apology from Germany for their occupation of the country and burning down all the cities in Northern Norway but I honestly I don't really care. They obviously do not believe in that ideology anymore. I think that history is history.

&gt; so how democratic is to have less than 50% of the vote

The pro-independence parties had a majority of seats in Parliament. They had 47.6% of the vote, which is more than what the parties against independence had. And the majority of votes (more than 50%) were for parties supporting Catalonia's self-determination.

For comparison, PSOE is ruling Spain with only 22.6% of the vote. And that is not undemocratic, because that is how the [parliamentary system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_system) works (unlike a presidential system).

&gt; then make an amendment of the regional constitution without the needed 2/3 of their parliament

There was no amendment to the ""regional constitution"" ([Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Autonomy_of_Catalonia)). The last amendment happened in 2006, and there hasn't been any more yet.

&gt; without debate or right of amendments

Which happens everywhere in Spain, and the [Spanish Constitutional Court](https://www.eldiario.es/catalunya/politica/Constitucional-reglamento-Parlament-JxSi-CUP_0_713229236.html) said it was completely legal.


&gt;  then close the parliament for 3 straight weeks

The Parliament was closed right before the referendum so ALL parties could focus on the campaign for the referendum. The same thing happens with elections.

&gt; so you do not have to debate ANYTHING of what is happening or the consequences of a secession

This was debated in Parliament during the previous months. In any case, the parties that are against independence are those that always refuse to carry out these type of debates. So, I understand that your criticism is directed towards them. It is them who try to avoid any kind of debate about independence and its consequences, because they are not interested in discussing it.

I think that most Catalans would be interested in more debates of this kind. But the unionist parties refuse to participate and usually try to boycott them.",Catalonia,/r/europe/comments/8ya801/joint_statement_by_the_governments_of_catalonia/e2aal3b/,Jopsterbob,1531436931

Secondly I would actually suggest you re-check your sources. 

Norwegians certainly felt that we were treated as a lesser being in both Denmark and Sweden. The period with Denmark was known as the ""400 year night"" due to that and we had constant fights with the Swedes on trying to preserve our autonomy during the 90 years with them which ended up us making a unilateral declaration of independence when we eventually got too pissed off by it.

Norway actually had the second highest rate of emigration to the USA after Ireland. 

The original Norwegian language was completely killed off during Danish rule and replaced with Danish. The modern Norwegian language is actually a 19th century invention.

350,"&gt; Depends if you feel that any retaliatory strike would be part of mad-man strategy. Or the idea to use nukes if outnumbered in a conventional war is part of mad man.

Mad-man just requires that your opponent fears that you'll do those things, which you already seem to. I guess from that point of view their actual strategy isn't especially relevant against a leader who would view things that way, since whether they're willing to use nuclear weapons or not he would surrender.

&gt; Then Russia conquers the world. What does it mean ? Russia can barely rule its own self.

Maintaing power is fundamentally about being able to direct revenue toward one's supporters; that is easily achieveable with all of Europe to loot.

&gt; Using as few as a 100 nuclear weapons might lead to a nuclear winter that could kill 99% of all people. There is no worse option than that.

If one assumes that it takes 100 weapons in the Northern Hemisphere to do that, but if instead takes more like 1000 of them detonated at more southernly latitudes then Option C can still be worse, since it makes a larger nuclear war there more likely. There just isn't certainty around exactly how many cities would firestorm in such a war.

Countries needn't pursue them now because they assume that anyone launching an attack would find themselves fighting an extremely expensive conventional war with more powerful nations, or being devastated by a nuclear war with the same nations. For example, Poland doesn't pursue nuclear weapons because they believe America, the UK and France will defend them. But if America follows your strategy and surrenders completely when a single Russian division lands in Alaska, then Poland obviously must build nuclear weapons itself if it doesn't want to surrender.",Scotland,/r/europe/comments/8xyswf/perceptions_of_the_eu_as_a_security_actor/e2aavjc/,LurkerInSpace,1531437207

419,"The Danes have struggled with this issue for over 30 years (with non western immigrants) and 50-60 years with Danes. The problem is the construction of the concrete public housing projects.

In the decades after ww2 the Danes urbanized and with the build of the welfare state a lot of element constructed concrete apartment complexes were made. It later turned out they were often poorly constructed and had a considerable shorter lifespan than other types of houses build before and after. Plus the way they were planned as separated city areas within cities has proven detrimental to integration of Non Danish residents. 

So these public housing projects will be completely renovated, rebuild or demolished regardless of who lives there. They are public eyesores and the fact that a lot of the inhabitants have low education, employment and income (social benefits) just makes it so much more urgent to deal with the situation.

The difference in life expectancy between a middle class area with high employment and property ownership and with a ""ghetto"" area is roughly 13 years. That means these areas with lots of social and economic problems is also plagued with health issues.

Now this article is populist biased shit, but it does touch on a key point. The concrete public housing projects of the 1960's was a mistake and it is about time something is done.

Yes Putin is a huge asshole. I don't believe MH-17 was shot down deliberately though. It was shot down due to wilful negligence and then denied/covered up by the rebels and Russians due to them lacking any conscience or shame for what they did.

Paris was out of bread and people started questioning the nobles who were doing very ok. 
They overthrew the nobles in a violent move but the king was still there (revolution in 1789 and the king was executed in 1791). The reason of his death was because of three mains points: 
1 he was seen as a useful pawn of europe monarchies who were gonna come and destroy the revolution then reinstate the king. Killing him stopped that from happening
2 He was still loved by a LOT of people, hardcore revolutionary wanted him dead and this buffoon run away in a secret operation (to get to France worst enemy and come back with an army to rule again). End of the love in 1791.
3 nobles were dealt with already the king was the last step a really symbolic one. At the time killing a king of divine right was a big deal. The fact France killed him gave the revolution a big signal to every country outside of france.

I do see your point, however there have been so many parties (supporting either side) that have intervened that it is hard to say it is infringing in Spain's interior business.

540,"&gt; Classic deflection. Not relevant.

Low crime is not relevant in determining how safe people feel. The nationality of criminals who still partake in said low crime is way more important. Gotcha. 

&gt;Assumptions without proof, can you give some source of that of the non western 15000 prisoners ~12000 are non western drug mules? Its wishful thinking, the same thing you accuse all the frustrated putin bots of.

&gt;BUTTTTTTT unlike you I can specify it. Don't worry I got you. Suspects in crime:

What are you on about? I didn't say 12 of 15k prisoners were drug mules. Just like the BBC article I've linked and what you've clearly neglected to read didn't suggest that, either. It simply stated that the mid-2000s rise in Dutch prisoner numbers was attributable to stricter checks at Schipol. 

But your table is utterly irrelevant to the topic at hand. We're talking about prisoners, not people suspected of crimes. As you can see from the former clocking in at 10.000 currently, while the latter was 220.000 4 years ago, they aren't exactly synonymous with each other. Many people suspected of crimes will not get sentenced and many who do get sentenced don't get sentenced to prison, so 10% of foreign *crime suspects* for drug crimes is absolutely not indicative of the share of mules among *prisoners*. And when I say prisoners, I refer to people sentenced to prison sentence, not people being held before their trial. 

&gt;(ps, can be translation, but you are reading the numbers wrong, the prisoner number is 35k, of which 15k non-western immigrants, only 6370 western foreigners)

So besides not opening any of the links in my previous comment, you don't even have many clues about the topic, either. You don't have 35.000 prisoners in the Netherlands, are you crazy? You've had [10.102](http://www.prisonstudies.org/country/netherlands) on September 30, 2016, 30% being pre-trial detainees and 19.2% being foreigners. Whenever we talk about incarceration rates in a country, it's always calculated by the number of incarcerated people at a particular date, not the total of people who spend time behind bars during the given calendar year. 

Your link talks about detainees. Anyone who spends a single night behind bars is a detainee, even if they are released the next. And yet, we don't consider those 'prisoners' in the everyday use of the word. Nor do we consider people held for trial that, either. 

And realistically, we also think of people who go to jail for a few weeks or months fundamentally differently than those who get there for years, but I suppose those are both prisoners nonetheless.

Literally every paper I read before the game talked about how deadly their midfield was and how they can’t be allowed to have any space. Our commentators were practically salivating over Modric and Perisic the whole game.

The *only* thing they said was “Croatia might be tired seeing as the amount of football they’ve had to play so hopefully England can capitalise on their legs*.

596,"They could - in theory and purely from a legal perspective nothing is stopping them. (Well, depending on the interpretation of the extradition treaty, it would violate international agreements, but since there’s no sanctions in place anyway, who cares?)

OTOH the whole foundation of the EAW and intra-EU extradition system (as well as most other international extradition treaties) is that no country must extradite someone for an act that is not punishable by the laws of that country. The corollary is that no country must prosecute an extradited person for a crime unless they were extradited for those specific charges and those charges are punishable offenses in the extraditing country.

Otherwise, a country could theoretically request extradition on the grounds of some minor charge and then - once the person has been extradited - prosecute them for a crime that has much more serious consequences - or even a crime that would not even **be** a crime in the extraditing country. 

Think of Germany requesting extradition of someone for, say, theft which would carry a fine or some minor jail time at most. But once they are in Germany, they could be prosecuted for, for instance, displaying a swastika and locked up for 5 years (not saying anything about the specific laws, just an example of how even between EU countries, criminal codes can sometimes be quite different). 

Most democratic countries’ laws have explicit provisions against aiding in the prosecution of acts which aren’t punishable by the countries’ own laws - and for good reason. 

So if Spain were to accept extradition for graft and then were to prosecute for sedition, all other European countries would probably stop cooperating with the Spanish authorities in future extradition matters. 

They would pretty much have to do this, since they could no longer guarantee that extradited persons wouldn’t be subject to additional - and possibly (from the extraditing country’s POV) entirely unjustified - prosecution. 

If it’s worth that much to Spain, they are free to accept extradition for graft and then prosecute for sedition - but if I were in the Spanish government, I’d seriously ask myself if I really wanted to wreck the reputation of my government and break out of the international extradition system over this.

641,"&gt; I hardly belive that 90% of spanish law professors think, that the law of a foreign country has the authority over spanish people in spain

No, they obviously didn't say that. You are twisting my words again...

More than 90% of Spanish law professors think that neither Puigdemont nor other ministers committed rebellion. You can read them in Spanish. And not only them, but judges including emeritus judge of the Spanish Supreme Court or attorneys of the Spanish Constitutional Court have said exactly the same. Spanish law is very clear about this.

The fact that the German court has rejected the rebellion is just another proof of this, because both legal systems define and interpret this particular crime (not all crimes) in the same way.

The only precedent of rebellion in Spain happened in 1981: [1981 Spanish coup d'état attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_Spanish_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt). They were sentenced for rebellion.

If you read the facts and the legal arguments, you will see that what happened in 1981 is at the antipodes of the Catalan independence referendum of 2017. The events of 2017 are not rebellion under Spanish law. And (since the crime is the same in Germany), they also aren't rebellion in Germany.

657,"Norway has 2 trillion m³ of natural gas reserves left, at the current production rate that's empty after 10 years (Or 4 years if it supplies all the natural gas the EU needs)

It is right now impossible to supply the EU with enough LNG from the US, as the distance is too long for the current fleet of LNG carriers to deliver enough. (See this post i made in this thread for the calculation: https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8y8hce/poland_renews_call_for_eu_to_cut_reliance_on/e294erx/ )

Edit: I might as well post what i would do instead:

First: Stop production in Norway, keep the natural gas there as a strategic reserve in case Russia does shit. (If you are afraid of Russia now, think about what will happen if one of our realistic alternatives has run dry) We have to pay Norway for the lost profit of course, but i think our long term security is worth it.

Second: Increase imports from Russia. Yes people don't like it, i don't either, but what alternatives do we have?

Third: Try to build new pipelines to Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. This might not be realistic, especially in regards to Iran and because it takes a decade from planing to construction to get a pipeline. (Again, nobody really likes that, but again we don't have that many alternatives)

Fourth: If possible build more LNG tankers, again this takes time and we need quite the fleet to really make a dent in our demand, but it gives us security.

What we in Europe should really be afraid of is Russia once the petrol/gas funds run dry when the world changes to renewables. The UN expects 80% by 2050. Right now you can keep Russia in check because it depends on that money. Once it dries up, it will be very unstable. I would expect that during that time, the chance for war has been the highest its ever been since the end of the cold war.

It’s completely understandable that they want to use this to their advantage but in this photo I simply see them representing their country.

The projected economic stimulation in Russia from hosting the World Cup is $31 billion (in USD).

The economic stimulus from Winter Olympics Pyeongchang in Korea was roughly $40-56 billion (in USD).

The UK has the worst press in the world, and they are largely based in England so they can't help but be awful when it comes to international competitions involving England. 

I support Liverpool, so with Trent and Henderson in the team I'm quite fond of your national side, plus I think you have a fantastic manager in Gareth Southgate - he really calmed the press the first week, make props to him. But as I said, that second week there was almost an arrogance from the press that England would be in the final, and that's what gets up people's noses, especially when every news bulletin covers it.

714,"Except that doesn't tend to be true in any way whatsoever. Look up relevant voter demos, and you'll quickly see how strongly those parties overperform in rural areas, where the only refugee they'll ever see will be on the telly, and how (relatively) badly they do in the large cities where these alleged changes in safety should most occur. 

Which, more frequently than not, don't actually happen. What's really changed is people's perception of safety. 

[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/KMQmknW.png) the share of English and Welsh that think crime is going up and [here's](https://i.imgur.com/73yu2p3.png) how it actually looks. 

[Same is true in the US](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/16/voters-perceptions-of-crime-continue-to-conflict-with-reality/ft_16-11-16_crime_trend-2/). 

Italy had [25% less crime and 65% fewer foreign crime suspects](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2018/03/03/has-immigration-really-led-to-an-increase-in-crime-in-italy/) in 2016 than it had in 2008. 

For all the memes about Malmö, [rapes per 100.000 population](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39056786) basically matches the data from Gothenburg and Stockholm. 

Homicides in France fared like [this](https://i.imgur.com/GuuXbFa.png), used to be around 1400 in the 90s. 

Sweden had 1/3 fewer people in its prisons in 2017 than it did in 2005, with a corresponding drop in reported violent crimes. 

So no, it's foolish to say host societies became objectively less safe, even with the caveat of only meaning localized hotspots, unless you're talking door-to-door, street-to-street changes too irrelevantly minor to mean something on the national scale. This has firmly gotten a game of emotions over facts, and the former are winning so far.

After uniting france after a decade of anarchy, or more, after a monarchy that destroyed our country's economy, he finally bring back order, and gave us laws, and modernized france to what was possible in the 1800s.

He also gave a name to Nationalism in Europe ; the ones that later gave ideas to create Italia, Germany, and later to slowly destroy from the inside the Austria-Hungary empire. Seeing all the French together gave 'ideas' to the other nationalities that were either not united (such as Italia and Germany), or those that were under an empire, like the A-H.

He can indeed be considered a villain, but at the same title as the British and their actions in the US, or as any military leader at the time.

That's where you are wrong.

Russian equipment is roughly as expensive as western equipment in most cases.

892,"Empty threat.

NATO is a key pillar of US hegemony in Europe. The US Deep State knows that better than Trump, which is why they were freaked out during his nomination and election. However, there has been long-running American frustration over ""not fair burdensharing"" for many administrations - same frustration as with China and lack of reform - so they let Trump play the wild man but he is just a puppet.

Bottom line, however, there is *no way* that they will let NATO go up in smoke. Russia would much easier be able to cut bilateral deals between major European powers (Germany and France in particular, also Italy) and US influence worldwide would fall since a lot of it depends on a compliant Europe which in turns requires NATO and similar security guarantees. And if the US Deep State wants to avoid anything then it is falling influence. They will let their mad dog puppet bark to try to offset their own costs but we have the cards here, not them. They need us more than we need them. Russia can't even invade and conquer Ukraine, which isn't part of the EU nor of any Western security guarantee.

Doesn't prove it either, and it gives some insight *why* that might be: people have an apprehension at the increasing immigration, rightly or wrongly, but keep ignoring their fear and it will continue to feed racism.

Stop your black and white thinking. Refusing to harbor any number of immigrants is not the same as an ideologically motivated genocidal mass murder campaign. Africa is not a concentration camp.

People will feel unsafe if you keep arguing for unlimited migration. They're not inhuman; they are willing to extend significant help.

The French did wreck Vietnam after losing a long war against the guerillas. But America made everything worse by coming there and by using napalm there. China during communist time also intervened, but it was a different China, that was long before Deng Xiaoping era.

Sarkozy's hand is as blooded as Cameron, Obama and Hillary. But it does not change the fact that America actively intervened there and played a huge role in wrecking the country. As Hillary put it herself, ""we came, we saw, he died!""

I will bring it back to you: please don't let these facts get in the way of a good old fashioned America white-washing. It's indisputable that America did wreck these countries or made the situation much much worse.

It looked like the Croatians noticed this and dug deep for energy and it paid off.

The environment in Europe is different and we have smaller companies, but I wouldn't call it pathetic, just different. Because these companies are doing things on a more local level or more focused on a certain niche.

The current (online) tech environment is very unhealthy and we see these companies pulling more power towards them each day, while ignoring the problems they cause. Over the last years these large tech companies have proven themselves to abuse their power and have major influence on the world. They basically control the stream of information we consume, so regulation to make sure they don't abuse that power (too much) is OK by me.

I think in a few years others countries will start doing things like the EU also. Turkey already has its privacy laws, California started it on a small scale, Brazil is looking into it. China is a bit of an outlier here of course with the government intervention, a reason the US is stopping them from buying into US companies in the tech sector lately. If the US does not take these kind of regulations seriously and their tech companies don't adapt in time, they might be the ones limiting their potential in the future.",,/r/europe/comments/8xstp1/google_risks_new_antitrust_fines_in_the_eu_the_us/e28um9n/,cissoniuss,1531386777

One eyewitness told the BBC that the fire started on the third floor when a petrol bomb was thrown at a closed window from inside the building, and the Kyiv Post reported that several flaming bottles held by Ukrainian unity activists outside were thrown into the front entrance, and through the windows on the second and fourth floors.[24][38][43] An official investigation conducted by the Ukrainian Interior Ministry stated that while no firearms were found inside the building, those on the roof were shooting at the crowd below, and accidentally set the building on fire whilst throwing petrol bombs from above.[62][63] One of the pro-Ukrainian protesters who was shot (non-fatally) by a sniper from the trade unions building was Andrey Krasilnikov, a Russian citizen and Euromaidan activist.[52] Russia Today disputed this report, saying that the fire was started intentionally by ""pro-Kiev radicals"", and that those who died were ""anti-government activists.""[64]

Also, the players really should have finished off Croatia in the 1st half, they had all the momentum and Croatia looked physically and mentally drained, especially after conceding so early.

They had to wait another 2 years. The polls in the winter of 1947 actually signaled that the Communist Party will lose, which was the reason for the February coup. What made the rise of the communists possible and eventually achieve the control of the country was a bet onthe  overall apathy of the Czechoslovak population. They expected that the majority of the population would be disinterested, disengaged, and apathetic toward dismantling the democratic system. This was the case in large cities like Prague and Brno, where the masses were oblivious in the takeover. The communists had to bus people from the countryside to Prague to demonstrate on the behalf of Gottwald, while the Prague population was going to its day-to-day business. Somewhere I read that Milada Horakova during the coup in 1948 was with other deputies of her party enjoying skiing in the mountains, as they underestimated the gravity of the situation, maintaining a belief that the strong democratic tradition of Czechoslovakia will prevent a rise of the totalitarian regime.",,/r/europe/comments/8xxpte/the_enduring_influence_of_the_czech_republics/e28m858/,kaik1914,1531372369

President Bill Clinton's administration knew Rwanda was being engulfed by genocide in April 1994 but buried the information to justify its inaction, according to classified documents made available for the first time.

Senior officials privately used the word genocide within 16 days of the start of the killings, but chose not to do so publicly because the president had already decided not to intervene.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/31/usa.rwanda

It took Hutu death squads three months from April 6 to murder an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus and at each stage accurate, detailed reports were reaching Washington's top policymakers.

The documents undermine claims by Mr Clinton and his senior officials that they did not fully appreciate the scale and speed of the killings.

""It's powerful proof that they knew,"" said Alison des Forges, a Human Rights Watch researcher and authority on the genocide.

NATO, the WTO, et al. benefit the US tremendously by making sure that everyone else plays by *our rules*.

My mother-in-law still remembers her childhood, in the middle of the night after being warned the UPA is coming to the village. 


Her parents were teachers and were warned by one of her Ukrainian students so the family could hide in the nearby forest. They could see the horrible atrocities committed by the UPA animals. She won't speak about it. She only cries when the topic comes up. 


So no, not all Ukrainians were animals, in fact majority were not but the UPA murderers definitely were. Whether you were Polish or a Ukrainian married to a Polish person your fate was sealed.

1520,"It is sad that Jews are afraid of the truth about the Holocaust.   
Jedwabne was a Polish town, which after 1939 was taken over by the USSR (communists).   
At that time, the Jews were communist collaborators.    
They were a Jewish 5 column.    
They become communist collaborators and sent their Polish neighbours to Siberia.     
There are many preserved memories of mothers kneeling in front of Jews so that they do not issue their sons.    


Then the town was taken over by the Germans. The Germans murdered Jews and communist collaborators.    
Events from this period were described by many historians. And even sociologists of Jewish origin such as Gross.
In his controversial book, he puts forward the thesis that Poles burned 1,600 Jews in the barn 7x9 meters - which is very unlikely.

The Poles tried to exhumation from this barn, but unfortunately Rabi Szudrich forbade checking how many bodies were buried.
He forbade when it turned out that together with the bodies, a commemorative monument to Lenin was buried and there are scales from German rifles.

The Jews are embarrassed by their attitude during the IIWW and they try to find nation that substitute their guilty.   

I hope that one day they will grow up to make the truth.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/8xxa50/israeli_and_polish_officials_commemorate_jedwabne/e281f14/,culmensis,1531350633

Es obvio que tienes la razón: Rusia debe enfocar en si mismo pero no lo está haciendo. Es necesario entender que una Rusia agresiva no está una cosa del pasado nada más.

No soy un experto en la historia rusa pero sé que Los Estados Bálticos tienen un papel muy importante para Rusia. Hasta que Rusia tomó control de la región de Kaliningrad, el país no tuvo un puerto de agua cálida. Los Bálticos representan la conexión entre Rusia y Kaliningrad y entre Rusia y el Mar Báltico. 

Adivino que el éxito de los Bálticos es una vergüenza pública para Rusia también. Son los únicos estados de la URSS en la UE y la OTAN y han mejorado en los años desde el fracaso de la URSS cuando Rusia no ha cambiado. En mi opinión, Rusia está creando un imagen de un país poderoso, pero no pueden satisfacer este papel.

Un país pobre como Rusia será peligroso todo el tiempo porque tiene las armas para amenazar el resto del mundo hasta que reciba la atención que quiere.

1664,"The combined current military strength of the EU even without the UK is quite strong. The problem comes with the fact that the EU isn't unified or at least it's armed forces aren't. 

I think it would be very possible to initiate a modernisation and unifying programme of all armed forces in the EU into one single military. So everyone is using the same equipment, ammunition, vehicles, aircraft, uniforms camouflage and so on. Take the best equipment available made in the EU and change everything to the unified military to use that.

I don't think it would be all that hard either to get everyone using the same or at least similar equipment. We already have the Euofighter for example. It would be possible to get every country to put forward what they want in a unified assault rifle for example and have design bureaus from leading firearms engineers and manufacturers to put forward multiple examples. That is usually how an assault rifle is put forward and then test trials are conducted to see which rifle is the best. One the best rifle is chosen and suggestion are put forward the engineers go ahead and improve them and then trials are done again this goes on for a while longer to iron out all the little problems and then the unified army would place an order for a million rifles for example. The first batch would be delivered in a year and then after that every 6 months or so. 

I could see that working quite nicely. Honestly the countries int he EU do get on quite well these days. Sure we have our problems with each other but I think if it was all done by a new integrated military that everyone was already happy with I don't see any problems.

I don't really see any problems with most Eu countries integrating their military either apart from language barriers although that's actually not as big of an issue as you would think. The French Foreign Legion works very well.

The US flat out refused to support the UK publicly, because it was thought relations with South America were more important; the US did not even join the embargo against Argentina, or freeze Argentine assets in the US (which the US has since has done after Argentina defaulted on US Banks).

Meanwhile the European states supported the UK publicly, joined the embargo, froze assets, and gave support in the Security Council, provided intelligence, etc...

Also, the US invaded Grenada in 1983, which was also a Commonwealth country just like the Falklands, without so much as informing the UK.

1899,"oh god dude, you just don't WANT to understand. neither me, nor the OP, EVER accused all people from RS of anything. I'm from RS, I don't hate myself.

&gt; Also, the fact that you don't live here is why you have the opinion about RS that you have. 

the fact that I WAS FORCED not to live there.

I've already been to demofest while visiting some of my friends from RS. Again, for the millionth time, I don't hate Serbs or ""all people from RS"". You should take an honest look at yourself and ask why **you** are trying so hard to make the connection between war criminals and ordinary people from RS.

Also, a music festival didn't make the pain of genocide go away, sorry to disappoint you.

Yes, RS was formed in 1991 with the stated goal of ""cleansing"" all non-Serbs from as much territory as possible, which *just a few months later* lead to the fact that all non-Serbs had to mark themselves with white armbands (so 1940s...) before being taken to the concentration camps of Prijedor, burning people alive in Višegrad, mass rape camps in Foča and so on and so on. Karadžić wrote that goal into the first constitution (while calling us ""nesrpsko življe"" as if we're cattle - dehumanization is genocide 101), into other directives, communicated it to his generals (with Mladic famously replying ""that's genocide!"" and you can hear that tape in the ICTY's archives).

Genocide being their goal was proven and accepted as fact by the ICTY, US Courts, German courts, Bosnian courts, historians, and confirmed by witnesses, survivors as well as perpetrators. 

Again, this is accepted by every sane person. After a whole day of ""discussion"", I'm starting to think that doesn't include you.

So I won't reply anymore. I have to go to dinner with my best friend, who was orphaned when both her parents were killed in Srebrenica. I'll try to comfort her and, don't worry, I won't mention what type of crazy I ran into today.

Have a nice day, us survivors can't. Greetings to RS, my parents still say it's beautiful.

This was notoriously the case with Rwanda, when president Bill Clinton did everything he could to not refer to it as a genocide so as not to get the US involved (once the term ""genocide"" is applied, the UN, and by extension the US, is pretty much mandated to act).

But in our Genocide Studies classes, the closest thing I recall us discussing in recent history was the UN and French intervention in Cote D'Ivoire. It is speculated that the civil war would have had the possibility of turning into a genocide had outside forces not removed the illegitimately elected president.

Although they had every right to practice their religion, it didn't stop them from happily joining Ustashe and killing Serbs in WW2.

There is Serbo-Croatian language, that is spoken in Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Croatia, but Bosnian and Montenegrin languages are literally made up so that national identity could be built around it. 

There was no ban on term Bosniak too, because it was term created in 1993. to replace Muslim. Again, that was done only because they needed some national identity, since ""Bosniaks"" are mainly Serbs and Croats that took Islam as their religion.

1967,"&gt; Sure, maybe a ground station can track you, but can the enemy aircraft do that too? Does the enemies long range anti-air missile's radar seeker track your aircraft? That kind of stuff makes it near impossible to really judge the value of stealth. 

Redundant argument. Over friendly airspace, no matter what, with current integrated ground radar structures, even an F-4 Phantom would ""see"" an SU-35 earlier than vice versa. Stealth only matters in determining how much earlier that outdated shitplane sees you when attacking enemy airspace.

&gt; And we would benefit from the global supply chain of the F-35. 

Not really, no. That's not how logistics work. Simple example from outside the box: there's tons of 2018 BMW 3 series in the world. Like, tens of thousands probably. But if you need maintanance for it in Myanmar, that will still be costly. Scaling doesn't work that way as we are not all buying stock parts together, at the same price and quantity.

&gt; AFAIK the Rafale is significantly cheaper than the Typhoon, so I wouldn't say it's just because of small numbers. 

Not really, now. Certainly not when it comes to purchasing them.

Are you seriously trying to claim that this doesn't make the most sense? Skripal was one of the biggest traitors to Russian intelligence in history, and the Russian government has assassinated people for far less. Russia has an extremely obvious motive here.

And anyway, what exactly is *your* theory here?

That the British government decided to assassinate the Skripals using an obviously dangerous nerve agent *on their own soil*, even though  the reason Sergei Skripal was even living in the UK was that the UK traded for him in a spy swap? You think the British government wanted to kill that guy?

Everything about this theory is just stupid. The British government has no motive, has no history of publicly assassinating people on their own soil, and if they *did* want to do this most certainly wouldn't have unleash a fucking nerve agent in the middle of a town, for exactly the reason that these substances are incredibly lethal, as shown by the innocent death of a person months later, as well as the additional poisoning of two others.

&gt;
&gt;Excellent, the war will be over by Christmas, because we can now recruit people to fight in a war that wouldn't be useful at all to the present situation.

Ironically you're making the ""war will be over by Christmas"" argument for Russia here.

&gt;Now that ramp up would require years of planning and exorbitant costs. 

Why do you believe that? The technology isn't new. There is no shortage of resources, engineers or factories. Logistics is measured in days not months now.

Because it takes 3 years to assemble a full plane today doesn't mean it would tomorrow when priorities are different.

&gt;&gt;Logistics and manufacturing aren't as big a problem anymore
&gt;
&gt;You're absolutely right. They are an even bigger problem than back then. Given how weapons can completely decimate infrastructure on a surgical scale unheard of in 1936.

Things are not nearly as centralised as they were in 1936 as logistics are not as much of a problem. The factory doesn't need to be beside the port. Russia does not have the forces to subjugate 28 countries at once.

&gt;&gt;The combined military of the EU is already better equipped than the Russians and we are far, far richer.
&gt;
&gt;France was better equipped than Germany in WW2. At least in a parity kind of way. Yet it lost in a month because they weren't ready for a war.

That's debatable. They lost because of their reliance on the Maginot line, not their equipment or soldiers. Frenchmen kept fighting till the end of the war.

This is easy to say for us in retrospect. But only if you don't understand the chain of events or the situation they found themselves in. 

The day before the massacre, the Serbs had complete operational control of Srebrenica, and the Dutch forces in srebrenica were essentially hostages without any support at that point. What's more, Mladic explicitly threathened to kill the refugees at the UN compound if NATO forces fought back. The Dutch forces initiately believed (or *needed* to believe) that so long as they cooperated, the civilians would be spared and simply deported. By the time the atrocities started, they had no means of stopping anything; it started sporadically with rumors of and isolated reports, and then any soldier that tried would probably have been shot on the spot without accomplishing a damn thing. There was also the belief (possibly justified) that if they tried anything, the Serbs would stop deporting the women and start murdering them too.

I was called nazi equally fast and I still live. Live by a sword die by a sword. Unless it is only left side allowed to use that tool.

&gt; Okay first things first my God-fearing friend

I'm not :) I just live in a country which used to respect people of religion. I can mock them but degrading them is low.

&gt; I have NEVER hated religious people

It looked differently

&gt; I hate the institutions of religion for what they have done, and what they continue to do (by the way, I don't care what they're called, I hate them all equally. Just to be clear so that you won't be calling me an Islamophobe next).

You was treated with wide brush, pal. This thread is full of antlchristian waccos but miraculously I haven't seen one, just fucking ONE mention of Protestantism. ""Coincident? I don't think so"" ;)

&gt; What you call sick feelings, **I call that my opinion**, and I'm more than happy to express them. You apparently wants to censure me. Shame on you.

1. Opinion which should trigger ban

2. I was banned more than once for expressing my opinion. I'm on my crusade against double standards since then.

&gt; Why you bothered with me? Well, I suppose you want to save me and make me see the light, isn't that what you christians usually do?

Not really. As I wrote I hate double standards, that is all. I'm not inquisitor, quite opposite I preach tolerance and respect as long as counterpart reciprocate favor.

&gt;  and like the nazi label you tried to color me with earlier, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't call me that.

Be nice person and nice things will happen.

&gt; Oh and it's not just atheists who get abortions. Religious people do to, so please don't get on that high horse.

Do you really believe that practicing Catholics have the same number of abortions per capita as atheists, really?

&gt; Both armies exterminated the Vendée, secular as well as catholic. At least according to the Wikipedia article.

Of course, when state drown rebellion in blood both victims are equal /s 

Regardless, each sufficiently big and long lasting movement will have its worse sides and if you think that seculars are any better.... This make whole argument about institutional religion quite weak.

It looks like you haven't read the acticle at all, not only the title is justified, the whole article explain why BoJo is one of the main reason for the Brexit, but it's not even click-bait. It is plain truth, BoJo ruined the UK as there are no good option for the UK. In fact the pound lost a few decimals after his resignation as the market fear no deal exit.

&gt;It's about Boris Johnson who is quickly becoming old news this long after his resignation

What? Say who? You?

&gt;It's about British politics, which I'm sure mainland Europeans only have a limited interest in. This is not the correct subreddit IMO.

So now suddenly Europeans arent interested in the Brexit anymore? Say who? You?  The UK is in Europe,  the Brexit will affect millions of lives, this is a pretty good article explaining what happened in the UK, a giant populist troll lead them to a crash.

&gt;This topic has already been discussed at length in previous posts over the last 24+ hours.

This isnt about BoJo resignation this is about how BoJo managed to con the whole UK for a few years, why and how he did it and the consequences it will have.

&gt;The article is *incredibly* biased, too lengthy to be enthralling and is tangential.

That is your *incredibly* biased opinion. This is indeed an opinion it is written on the top of the article. Here is my incredibly biased opinion : it's one of the best article Ive read from the NYT in a long time, probably because it is an opinion. And it's not lenghty at all, pretty short actually but maybe you're like Trump and prefer drawings and power-points?

It takes less than a minutes to read to explain how BoJo deceived the UK which is leading it to a bleak future. All the SUN and Daily miror reader should read that piece really.

So ""I"" is the noun doing the verb, whatever that verb is. I is nominative case.

Other cases can be used for things like destinations, so if you are traveling somewhere, you can use a different case for that. This depends on the language, but is called the Lative case generally.

Or if I stab you with a sword, the sword isn't the target of the stabbing (that's you) so the sword gets another case. This is the ablative case. It is an agent of the verb, neither the subject nor the object.

Think of cases as roles that nouns are doing in a sentence.

To make it really complex:

I stab you with Dave's sword.

Here there are 4 nouns! I, you, Dave, sword.

Here we use the genetive case for Dave, since his role in the sentence is providing provenance. The sword is still the agent, so is ablative.

This is so true and here lies the fundamental tragedy between our perception of Russia and everyone else's. For decades we have been called warmongers and paranoid lunatics always seeing a potential war from a country that is seemingly just like every other European country after the fall of communism. It is not. People don't understand the historical revisionism and the fact that chauvinistic imperialism did not disappear in Russia like it did in most other former colonial empires. We know the history of its actions, we notice the hybrid warfare, we notice how the state-controlled media in Russia talks about it and if you put 2+2 together, you will see that it's still all the same. This country has not changed and it won't in the foreseeable future. It is a tragedy for us that so many in the West systematically refuse to see it.

Because Germany is the closest industrial power to these countries.  Their low wages subsidize the cost of German industry.  The additional shipping costs to France or Italy don't apply.  Germany's central position in Europe is critical to the Euro imbalance.

Except that they're the most ostracized among the EU, because western liberalism is delusional as regards immigration.

Meanwhile, the countries in the East, which have experienced extreme ethnic purging, and now have largely ethnically monogamous populations *they are happy with*.

There was zero attempt by the Serb authorities in Belgrade or in Bosnia to avoid a conflict with a compromise, nor were there any attempts to lessen the impact on civilian populations. On the contrary, Serbian forces, together with a failing YPA and Serb militias conducted a campaign that targeted civilian areas in an attempt of psychological warfare against non-combatants, which would cause a breakdown of political opposition, and an exodus from supposedly Serb territories. Were they the only ones doing illegal practices? Of course not, Bosniak and Croat forces also have their share of illegal actions, such as the exodus caused by  operations during Oluja, but the largest and most impactful crimes were conducted by Milošević regime and their allies, who had followed a consistent and systemic path towards constructing a Greater Serbia via ethnic cleansing from the very beginning.","Yes, the evil Kalergi plan",/r/europe/comments/8xvs4e/today_marks_23_years_since_the_srebrenica/e26gy6t/,Jabadabaduh,1531293672

2409,"&gt;We spent waaay more than that in WW1/WW2. You might not remember how much it cost because you sat out until the first couple of years both times.

Okay, I assumed when we referred to military spending. The cut off point was WW2. Especially since NATO, you know our whole discussion point was formed after. I don't exactly see the point in bringing up funding in the civil war since it was only after world war 2, that we committed to collective defense.

On that subject, people don't remember, but USA was pretty much the most isolationist country in the world (given the relative power) until WW2. The world(Europe) forced the opposite. It's also a fucking lovely thing how you both took shots at America's over aggressive foreign policy and how they didn't join a war sooner. News flash. Canada was forced to join WW1. Basically forced to join WW2.

And I can assure you I know exactly how much was spent on WW2, given that that it represented 40% of our entire government budget. 

So take that in modern day. Let's just say our spending is like 4.5 trillion dollars I have no idea with Trump. Roughly two trillion dollars a year fighting world war 2. That's roughly 6 years of the **total** Canadian budget per year. x 3 years. 18 years of the entire Canadian federal budget on World War 2.  Not to diminish the Canadian contribution. 

I, being a person interested in history know all too well the importance of Canada in both wars, but especially world war one. Canada produced like a third of the grain Britain ate, and produced something like half the ammunition used by em. (These numbers are fuzzy in my head and google searching isn't presenting shit. So it could be wrong, but the gist is correct) in WW2, Canada was the architect in the largest pilot training program in history during WW2. Allies don't win in WW1 without Canada.

&gt;Also, I don't see how not spending money to harass Ho Chi Minh or blowing up hospitals in Grenada is somehow some kind of harmful thrift. Even the DEW line, which we did half pay for, just gave you the ability to shoot Soviet missiles down so they would fall on us, not you.

Yes, America's military interventions can be boiled down into such simplicity. I guess you would have preferred a unified Korea as well. Except you know, the opposite. People screamed about Rwanda and USA's lack of intervention. I don't know if people know this, but it's exceptionally hard for governments to decide when to intervene, it's even harder for the perceived leading world power. Vietnam for example. Who's to fucking say that the Korean war was a good idea, and the Vietnam war was a bad one? They were both exceptionally similar, but because one had a good result and the other had a bad one it's forever marked. 
 
&gt;I don't see Canada spending 2% in the future, but I also don't see Canada regretting not meeting your 2% target, given both the fact that these funds would go to US arms manufacturers that generally cheat us as well as the fact that the USA has a penchant to stir up military trouble with countries that we do not have a problem with (e.g. Cuba).

Logical fallacy of association. We're not talking about a fucking joint funded military or whatever, we're literally talking about the **Canadian** armed forces. Politics aside, it's best not to conflate the two issues. This whole USA wants everyone to buy their arms thing is a red herring. First off, there has never been any requirement whatsoever, the only exception is Israel when USA gives free money. Canada is free to buy from whoever they choose, it's just that because USA produces the best stuff, often times those things align. 

Canada, should spend money on the military because they it's their best interest to do so. Just like it's USA's prerogative to ask that nations meet their obligations and get rightfully pissed when they don't. Being rightfully upset with America's foreign policy shouldn't dictate your own military spending.

Also, this whole Canada doesn't need a military thing because no one will invade us, is an absolute absurd theory. Does Canada care at all about the arctic? Get ready, Russia is spending big on ice breakers.

2484,"&gt; News flash. Canada was forced to join WW1. Basically forced to join WW2.

lol maybe you should spend more on history books and less on fucking around beating up third world countries. 

Canada was part of the empire in 1918 and was super enthusiastic about protecting the rest of it (just as in the Boer war). In 1939 it only took six days for us to join the UK again, which we did with Parliamentary approval, given that we had been delegated independent foreign policy powers in 1931. So you don't know what you're talking about, which is not a surprise (probably to either of us).

&gt;Who's to fucking say that the Korean war was a good idea, and the Vietnam war was a bad one?

Uh the UN? You know, the institution that both supported the police action in Korea (which we and a bunch of other countries were also involved in) but tried (unsuccessfully) to get you and North Vietnam to commit to a ceasefire for 6 consecutive years, thereafter condemning both sides?

There is a reason that citizens of nearly every foreign country bring up the USA's military misadventures. Individual Americans are not particularly ashamed of the problems that their country creates, even with close allies, and there is always a risk of the USA drawing us in to yet another superfluous war. Fix this and then ask us to spend 2% on NATO.

Ask around to see if Germans or French or Dutch here feel any differently.

2499,"&gt;One could now object that it is not in the US strategic interest to let Russia expand its sphere of influence by removing protection from eastern EU states. This might well be true. However, this overlooks the fact that removing protection is not a binary choice. Trump could create enough ambiguity to create fear and uncertainty in the eastern EU members while preventing Russia from actually acting aggressively. This fear and uncertainty alone could create significant economic and political damage in the countries concerned by spooking investors and driving voters into extreme camps.   
&gt;  
&gt;So, unfortunately, the lesson for the Europeans from the first 18 months of Trump in the White House has to be that economic power will count for very little if it is not backed by a certain amount of military power. It might not be necessary to be able to run a medium-sized war anywhere on the planet (as the US military is), but the EU cannot remain dependent on the US for its own protection if it wants to stand firm in an economic conflict with it.   
&gt;

2548,"The provincial and federal governments are creatures of the same statute which empowers them differently (Constitution Act, 1867) but never one over the other. The provinces within confederation are equal rather than subservient to the federal government. Common law dictates that federal provisions prevail over provincial ones in a conflict of laws scenario but that’s a rare situation and merely a means of tiebreaker.

An example of a subservient governmental entity is a municipality or regional district within a province: provincial legislation brings it to life and while it is delegated authority by the province, the province ultimately has the power to supersede, change, or extinguish it. This famously happened with Toronto’s suburbs in the 90s when they were amalgamated into a single entity by the overarching provincial government against their will.

The territories are very similar, only relative to the federal government instead.

You said provinces can’t set their own court procedures and that’s simply wrong. It’s governed by [section 92(14)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-4.html) of the Constitution Act, 1867:

&gt; The Administration of Justice in the Province, including the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those Courts.

That speaks for itself.

&gt; Thirdly, why would you accuse me of not knowing Canadian law and then go ahead an cite the 1867 British North America Act and not the actual 1982 Constitution Act which increases the rights of the provinces?

You’re mixing up documents and likely not familiar with their history. The BNA Act laid the groundwork for federalism and remains the fundamental document delineating federal and provincial jurisdiction. When the Constitution was patriated in 1982 the BNA Act became known as the Constitution Act, 1867, while the new additions became known as the Constitution Act, 1982. 

The Canadian Constitution is not one document: it’s a collection, most notably the two Constitution Acts and less importantly some others like the Quebec Act, 1774 which lays the foundations of Quebec’s exceptionalism.

Contrary to your statement there’s very little about jurisdictionalism in the Constitution Act, 1982. [Take a look for yourself](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html#h-38).

The first 35 sections are famously known as the “Charter of Rights and Freedoms” and the remaining provisions are for constitutional tinkering, including the amending formulae.

Do some reading first if you’re actually interested in discussing this. Frankly [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Canada) is a decent overview to at least get a basic grasp on the issue.",,/r/europe/comments/8xppvi/would_you_support_the_eu_becoming_a_european/e266tbi/,Vorenvs,1531279690

Why are those two separate cases if they are the same verb?

I hope my question makes sense.

I've just started learning a couple of case languages, including Latvian, Russian, and German, and my understanding of case is that the case you use depends on which verb you use. Like, ""I accuse you."" I still don't get the difference between genitive and dative.

Mostly ministers are not educated at all about their fields and chosen for political reasons. So directly electing them wouldn't really be a change.

Ministers usually have people working for them who know what they are doing. Still a meh system if you ask me.

2611,"A unified army for Europe is crucial for the safety, stability and sovereignty of the European nations and the Union. To elaborate on this point we have to consider the current state of the union, all EU states are part of the same market where goods, services, commodity and people flow freely. Yet securing this motion of movement is not in any of the EU states main interest to preserve, rather the interest lies in defending it's own market which is flawed since there is no individual market. 


This flaw however is not fully realized as EU nations still preserve their old interest while not realizing that the level of integration is already too great and that there's really no alternative back away from the union as it wouldn't have a net positive interest for any of the union members(see brexit). As such if one nation were to fall then the rest would follow and feel the consequences, prime example being that of Greece but also very well potential threat such as a sweep invasion and annexation of the baltic states. The latter scenario would certainly cause dissent among members and as such further division which benefits no member state, aka instability of the union. If we were to keep this unified market and as such the union then we can't let anything disrupt the flow of the market or even halt it. 


In the current time frame the one who preserve the flow and stability of the market despite the current conflicting interest of the EU states is the US through NATO. The US of course does this generous service as it benefits them equally as it does for us, this is further proven with the lack of NATO dissolution after the cold war. While we in Europe may have lots with common with our ally to the west, we also have lots of conflicting interest. Neither is it guaranteed that our common interest is permanent which is highlighted nicely with Trump or potential future event that may shift it as well. The only way to truly realize the future interest of the EU and the EU states is to make sure we do it ourselves.


All of the elaborated talk however can only really function if we realize that a common foreign policy must first be established to enable the requirement of a unified army, as nations have to be willing to give up their sovereignty and people in order to defend everyone's sovereignty and people. Whether you wanna agree on this point is up for discussion but there's no denying that the current state of the union is unsustainable and that something has to be done. 


To preserve the common interest of the EU states would be to establish a unified army. This isn't to say that living under other's nation sphere of influence is bad in fact you could describe our current scenario as that but one could at least see the danger of over relying on other nation and also see that our priority will only come second to what our protector want.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/8xq7px/is_it_time_for_an_eu_army/e25y7z8/,TheGhostEU,1531271309

ICJ advisory opinion on Kosovo said that declaring independence is not illegal. I don't see what set of circumstances affect that here.

Crimea could not remain independent, of course, Ukraine would crack down.

However, he's right in saying that the fundamental issue here is whether Crimea can declare independence.

So it's time we take this seriously and start working hard towards an European identity. I really don't see the problem with an EU army. It would be a huuge step in the right direction, although I think it's a weee bit early for a full on army.

""Do you really think a polish solider will take orders from a german?"" are you serious? Of course I do. Have them work and train together, do you really think they will give a shit as long as they respect each other and are working under a common EU flag. Don't you train the discipline aspect in the army? Some countries have big differences within them, are catalan and basque soldiers in the spanish army traditionally unruly and disrespectful? I doubt it although I admit I have no data on that. Do americans have problems with texan soldiers refusing to take orders from fancy city bois?

I also don't see how having different objectives would be an impediment. Current projects could go on but instead under the EU banner. Nowadays it's not like you can go anywhere guns blazing anyway without taking other countries into account, so what's the big difference? Why wouldn't portugal be able to keep going on its little trips to africa and join the african militaries on the cplp circljerk, is anyone else in the EU opposed to that? Other countries could propose projects of significance to them. 

Just instead of solely soldiers from that country there would be soldiers of a multitude of EU countries on any given mission.

We can start slowly and have a EU army for which every country would contribute X&amp;#37; of their resources for it. We don't have to fully switch and give up sovereignity all at once. Start the EU army project as an alliance like NATO and work up from that. Maybe ditch NATO for it, dunno. Federalization of the EU in some shape or form should be a given sooner or later. Now is not the right time, obviously, but overly nationalistic values really have no place anymore ...

Meh... Besides what I preach deep down I know there is no European identity and that will doom us. Our human tribal feelings will win.

&gt; NATO defines defence expenditure as payments made by a national government specifically to meet the needs of its armed forces, those of
Allies or of the Alliance. A major component of defence expenditure is payments on Armed Forces financed within the Ministry of Defence (MoD) budget. Armed Forces include Land, Maritime and Air forces as well as Joint such as Administration and Command, Special Operations Forces, Medical Service, Logistic Command etc. 

&gt; They might also include ""Other Forces"" like Ministry of Interior troops, national police forces, gendarmerie, carabinieri, coast guards etc. In such cases,
expenditure should be included only in proportion to the forces that are trained in military tactics, are equipped as a military force,
can operate under direct military authority in deployed operations, and can, realistically, be deployed outside national territory in support of a military force. 

&gt; Also, expenditure on Other Forces financed through the budgets of ministries other than MoD should be included in defence expenditure. Pension payments made directly by the government to retired military and civilian employees of military departments should be included regardless of whether these payments are made from the budget of the MoD or other ministries. Expenditure for peacekeeping and humanitarian operations (paid by MoD or other ministries), the destruction of weapons, equipment and ammunition, contributions to eligible NAT Omanaged trust funds, and the costs associated with inspection and control of equipment destruction are included in defence expenditure. Research and development (R&amp;D) costs are to be included in defence expenditure.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_von_Coudenhove-Kalergi
According to his autobiography, at the beginning of 1924 his friend Baron Louis de Rothschild introduced him to Max Warburg who offered to finance his movement for the next 3 years by giving him 60,000 gold marks. Warburg remained sincerely interested in the movement for the remainder of his life and served as an intermediate for Coudenhove-Kalergi with influential Americans such as banker Paul Warburg and financier Bernard Baruch. In April 1924, Coudenhove-Kalergi founded the journal Paneuropa (1924–1938) of which he was editor and principal author. The next year he started publishing his main work, the Kampf um Paneuropa (The fight for Paneuropa, 1925–1928, three volumes). In 1926, the first Congress of the Pan-European Union was held in Vienna and the 2,000 delegates elected Coudenhove-Kalergi as president of the Central Council, a position he held until his death in 1972.

2886,"&gt; Turkomans have been treated bad by the Ottoman Empire even though it was a Turkish Empire

The Ottomans had no problems with Turkomans or any ethnicity. The Ottomans hated nomads. Nomads didn't pay their taxes, harassed sedentary folks and they were unpredictable. They also rebelled a lot (see Celali revolts) and some nomads who were Alevi (Qizilbash) loathed the Ottoman empire. (a lot of them migrated to Iran and Azerbaijan though). The nomads just happened to be Turks.

The Seljuks had the same problems with the nomads. I remember reading in some source a Seljuk emir insulting Turkmen nomads for attacking Byzantines (the Seljuks were trying to establish peace).

Read here

&gt;[The Turks] killed thousands and tens of thousands of men and animals, and took hundreds of thousands five hundred horses with their supplies. [The Byzantines] were terrified and weakened and sent to the sultan, [offering] to give him three cities which they themselves had built, requesting friendship and pleading that [the sultan] extricate them from their position. The sultan was delighted and favored [the request] and sent three emirs with cavalry to remove them from there and take them to Constantinople peacefully. The emirs came to them by night, chased away the Turkmens, removed [the Byzantines] thence, and took to the road. The Turkmens dispersed here and there and disrespected the sultan, who had established friendship with their weakened enemies — who had been besieged and were almost in their grasp. 

&gt;However, [the Turkmens] followed them and unexpectedly struck at them seizing clothing, weapons, and horses, killing many, and looting, and from a distance [also] were shooting arrows and slingshots, and killing many of them. The Byzantines complained to the emirs blaming them and saying: ""This is your doing. You are allowing this. **But [the emirs] swore to them that ""it is not because of us, but because [the Turkmens] are unbelievers and savages and do not heed us and no one can stop their depredations.** "" By the time [the Byzantines] reached Constantinople they were fewer by 20,000 men. And thus, with a depleted army and disgraced, did [Emperor] Manuel reach his own country

So the problem was authority, not the ethnicity. The rulers couldn't control the nomads. For obvious reasons. Ottomans tried to solve this problem by forcing nomads to settle down and deporting nomads to Bulgaria and Eastern Thrace. It's much easier to control a village than a nomadic Turkmen tribe.","It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours",/r/europe/comments/8xnpke/germany_has_banned_an_ethnic_turkish_boxer_gang/e25igst/,Thephalanx23,1531257235
2887,"Thanks for such a thorough response!

Just to clarify: ""Sham operation"" doesn't mean looking down on the soldiers. They have nothing to do with it. It's a *political sham* by way of utterly lacking any conceivable long-term plan for the military. 

The examples you've mentioned are quite illustrative in that regard. Take the A400M. It's a jack of all trades, meaning it can do a little bit of everything, but nothing particularly well - that's exactly what you get when you don't know what you need. It's the lowest common denominator. 

But knowing what you need implies that you know what you do. A rapid response capability? A defence army? A support role military for the allies? An international peace corps? ... Right now, we seem to have a little bit of everything everywhere all at once, and that's exactly a sign of the mess we're in. 

I don't think throwing more money around will do it. It takes a *rebuilding* of the military altogether, which is a monstrous task to begin with and it will probably take at least a decade.

2914,"It is not really like a parliamentary democracy. If that were the case, then candidates to Comission Presidency would run on a platform supported by their party and after the elections there would be a negotiation between the parties so that there are enough votes for a single candidate to be president.

Currently, the way it works is that the Comission President (and all the Comissioners) must be chosen by the European Council (the assembly of member states governments) and then approved by the European Parliament, with candidates being chosen ""based on the results of the European Elections"".

This, of course, means that the Comission has typically been a plaything of national interests and power quotas. Sure, if Party X wins they will probably appoint a Comission President of Party X, but this is not guaranteed, and it need not be someone who Party X likes. 

This has multiple problems:

-It reinforces the idea that the EU is a shady bureuacracy run by unelected officials, which kind of (kind of) fair enough.

-It makes any actual European campaign (where European issues and etc. are discussed and debated) impossible, since there are no face candidates for the parties to promote to the citizens as some random person could come in and be the new President.

-It locks the positions behind political maneuvering by the national governments. Ignoring the 1-country-1-comissioner rule (which I get why it is in place, even if ideally it shouldn't), Comissioners depend on the approval of their government for the positions. So Vestager (ALDE) and Mogherini (S&amp;D) are not running for Comission President (even tough I personally think they would be great candidates) because Denmark and Italy are ruled by the EPP and a populist coalition respectively and thus they will want people from their party there.

Now, last elections saw some progress via the ""Spitzenkandidaten"" (""lead candidate"", in German) process, by which the Comission President must be the leader of one of the parties, and indeed Juncker was chosen this way. 

However, this was only a gentlemen's agreement since the Treaties say little other than ""based on the European Elections"" about the position of Comission President, and this agreement seems to have fallen off for next year: Parliament vows to stick to the Spitzenkandidat process while multiple countries (notably France) want to ignore it, but the Parliament and the Council in collision course.

So enshrining the Spitzenkandidat process in the treaties could be a good idea, but I think we should go for deeper electoral reform...

2916,"“He knows that the verdict of history is about to come down on him — and bury him.”

By Jenni Russell

Ms. Russell is a British journalist.

    July 10, 2018

LONDON — For the second time in three years, Boris Johnson, a politician whose ambition and superficial charm far outstrip his ability, judgment or principles, is destabilizing the British government and threatening the country’s future.

On Monday, Mr. Johnson, in protest against Prime Minister Theresa May’s plans for Brexit, resigned from his post as foreign secretary. Now Mrs. May’s authority, longevity and ability to deliver a Brexit without causing an economic crisis are in question. But further political paralysis seems certain.

Britain is in this mess principally because the Brexiteers — led largely by Mr. Johnson — sold the country a series of lies in the lead up to the June 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union. They did so because neither Mr. Johnson nor his fellow leader of the Leave campaign, Michael Gove, intended, wanted or expected to win.

At the start of 2016, Mr. Johnson was perhaps the most popular politician in Britain. Supporters and fans mobbed him at train stations and traffic lights; pollsters and pundits thought he could reach the parts of the country that other Conservatives could never touch. But he was also driven and insecure, so desperate to guarantee he would be the next prime minister that he cynically abandoned his own previous positions on the European Union in order to try to secure support from his party’s Euroskeptic right wing.

Because Mr. Johnson and Mr. Gove were confident that the Leave campaign was a hopeless cause, they were free to make ridiculous claims that they had no expectation of ever having to fulfill. They said that Brexit would make Britain both richer and more independent, with more money for the National Health Service, much greater control of immigration and continued friction-free trade with Europe.    

Every earnest warning from the other side — about how any Brexit would damage trade, business and jobs — was dismissed airily by the Brexiteers. There were no costs or downsides in this vision of the future.



This casual dishonesty has had devastating consequences.

In the two years since the Leave campaign unexpectedly won, nobody, from the prime minister to Mr. Johnson to the Labour Party, has been able to come up with a plan for exiting the European Union that can satisfy both a majority in Parliament and the expectant public. Why? Because fulfilling the false promises peddled by Mr. Johnson during the campaign is impossible.

The gulf between the easy, prosperous, productive Brexit that its voters are impatiently expecting, and the grim, complicated cost of disentangling economies that have been intertwined for decades has poisoned and paralyzed British politics.

The Conservatives’ leaders cannot admit to the electorate that they were deceived without splitting the party. And instead of apologizing for misleading voters, Mr. Johnson and the other Brexiteers have doubled down, taking refuge in optimistic slogans and vapid promises, refusing to believe the increasingly agitated evidence from hospitals, airlines, farmers, supermarkets and factories that a hard Brexit will damage them all.

Last week, Mrs. May finally attempted to force a recognition of reality on her divided cabinet by coming up with a compromise; a partial Brexit that allows goods free access in and out of Europe at the cost of accepting many European rules. It was an imperfect plan, but still it provided, finally, a starting point for negotiations with Brussels.

For three days, that compromise held, until the first political delusionist, the Brexit Secretary David Davis, broke free, still claiming that in some magical future Britain could get almost everything it wanted, if only the country would just stand by its demands.  

Petrified of being outflanked, Mr. Johnson followed suit, bringing with him the implicit threat that he could lead a rebellion against the government that other hardline Brexiteers will follow. It is a desperate move by a man who has lost almost all the credibility he had three years ago.  

All of Mr. Johnson’s weaknesses have been exposed: his lazy reluctance to do detail, his preference for bluster over thinking, his contempt for business. The campaign was meant to secure his future; instead, in damaging the country, he fears he has wrecked his own future, too. As one of his allies told me last month: “He knows that the verdict of history is about to come down on him — and bury him.”

Mr. Johnson seems to believe that this is his last chance to become prime minister: After his resignation this week, he hopes to be reborn as a rebel who will lead the party. But more likely is that he will once again create political chaos without delivering what he wants.

Two years ago, the side effect of Mr. Johnson’s ambitious maneuvering was to split the country and risk the prosperity and security of all Britons for decades. Now, just as a fragile basis for negotiation emerges, his selfish drive for vindication, attention and admiration threatens that, too.  

It is petrifying that the deliberate deceptions and wild ego of one man can so mislead a nation. (Americans know all about that.) One insider told me that Mrs. May was prepared for Mr. Johnson’s defection, and will outflank him, persuading wavering Conservatives that the time for fantasy has passed.

But Britain is teetering on the edge, on the verge of making catastrophic, irreversibly damaging mistakes. The danger is that Johnson might tip the balance in the wrong direction once again.

2936,"&gt; I'd say why the F not?

The reason is rather simple. Because armies are the basis of one sovereignty and essential to enact an own external policy. 

This is not too relevant for some members. In particular those whose sole identity lies on the European territory, and those who are powerful enough to lead Europe. 

If you consider the case of Portugal for instance, it falls in neither case. Portugal's identity is defined over 3 fundamental axis, European, Transatlantic and Lusophone. It is not powerful within Europe to lead and push it's agenda. So we must retain control.

If you look at current events, regarding Portugal, in terms of defence, the country has been pushing for further military integration within the CPLP (Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries). In particular Portugal + PALOPs (Portuguese Speaking African Countries).

The US was also caught stealing South Korea's ship related industry tech just a few years ago. 

And the US hasn't stopped economic espionage on Europe as well. 

https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/06/29/wikileaks_docs_show_nsa_vs_france/

&gt;Franco-American relations have taken a further hammering on Monday after WikiLeaks revealed new documents showing that the NSA has been collecting the details of commercial deals in the Land of Brie for over a decade and sharing them with its allies.

&gt;""The United States has been conducting economic espionage against France for more than a decade. Not only has it spied on the French Finance Minister, it has ordered the interception of every French company contract or negotiation valued at more than $200 million,"" said Julian Assange in a statement.

&gt;""Hundreds of such contracts are signed every year. The United States not only uses the results of this spying itself, but swaps these intercepts with the United Kingdom. Do French citizens deserve to know that their country is being taken to the cleaners by the spies of supposedly allied countries? Mais oui!""

&gt;According to a 2002 ""Information Need"" spying order [PDF], the NSA was tasked with collecting economic data from the French government, including details of business contracts, information on the state's macroeconomic policy, it's relationships with international lenders, and any dirt on ""questionable trade activities.""

&gt;A 2012 memo [PDF] is more explicit. It specifies that all economic deals or financing rounds worth more than $200m are to be investigated, with particular emphasis on activity relating to the IT and telecommunications industries, oil and gas production, environmental technologies, healthcare developments, and biotechnology.

&gt;This information was not just for the use of the US, the documents note, but would be shared with the other four of the ""Five Eyes"" nations: the UK, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.

&gt;The new release will be a massive embarrassment to the US government, since it has long maintained that the only reason the NSA exists is to spy on evildoers online – terrorists, organized crime, drug dealers, and the like. That the agency was specifically tasked to go after the economic interests of an ally will cause red faces all round.

&gt;French president Francois Hollande has already had one apologetic phone call from President Obama last week after it emerged that Hollande, his two predecessors in the Élysée Palace, senior ministers, and diplomatic staff had had their phones bugged by the NSA for years.

The fact that the big developed economies have nearly zero entry barrier to Hungarys markets is a huge win for them. 
This also comes at the cost that Hungary cannot build up some industries as a result of more developed markets outcompeting them. 
This is why China restricted their economies, stole most of the know how, built up theirs and only start freeing up to some extent now.

Feel free to judge me, but if I had a politician give an ethnic group more autonomy and then I saw that ethnic group try to assassinate their supporter, I'd probably take autonomy back too. The end of the use of the term ""Ukrainian"" doesn't mean much to me because I assume it was replaced with the old term ""Rus,"" which is still common in villages in Poland today. 

Also, the government had real fears from the Soviet Union so their actions, although extreme, aren't surprising. This reminds me of the internment of Japanese-Americans during WWII. Was it ethical? Not at all! Did it likely cause the war not to be delayed? Absolutely. 

Modern governments do the same even today. Try talking to American government worker with security clearance.

3229,"&gt; I understand what you wrote

*undrerstOOD

This is what pedantic looks like.

As for my previous comments, it's not a matter of being pedantic, but of exposing empty rhetoric that confounds the discourse pointing to issues that don't matter to anybody instead of the real points of contention.

&gt;  It doesn't matter if you call you illegal or uncontrolled immigration

It matters a lot! One is solved by removing the illegality, the other doesn't. One is mostly viewed as a morally acceptable position (one would react to it with ""who will argue that we should just accept violation of the rule of law?""), the other is way more contentious (one could react to it with ""who are you to deny the same opportunities you had handed for free to others that earn them?""). Even people that will take in as many immigrants as possible will agree that illegal immigration should be avoided. That's why calling it illegal matters.

&gt; I don't think anybody has a problem with illegal immigration just because it's illegal.

Then nobody should say that the problem is illegal immigration if it's not the problem they have with it. That's just a rhetoric device that confounds the discourse.

&gt; In other words, I don't think that anybody who has a problem with illegal immigration would accept open borders as a solution.

So you would therefore you say that ""the legal-illegal distinction it's just pure rhetoric that shouldn't even be part of the discourse""?

Erdolf has also encouraged Turks to ""Have five children, not two"" and told them ""They are the future of Europe"" (He said lots of other insulting shit about our continent).

You don't seem to understand it. Many people are working there, yes. And it is beneficial to the country, yes. But at the same time, it is far less beneficial than it could have been for two reasons I've mentioned: 

1. The added value is low. It means that while czech workhours might account for 80% of the workhours needed to produce a car, much smaller part of the revenues goes here
2. We're extremely dependent on one industry, serving external markets. Should the crisis come, people will buy much less new cars. Some 5% decline in income might cause 30% market dive.

3267,"&gt;a lot of the Polish-Ukrainian tension was artificially induced by Russia wishing to claim their lands by taking their side(sounds familiar?).

That's quite a manipulation you use there as a lot of tension was created by difference in culture and the fact that a lot of cossacks adopted Russian culture and church. It also didn't helped that you had Vasa III who tried to convert everyone into Catholic church. Indeed Cossacks was use by Russia to put tension, but you exaggerate it value.

&gt;By that I meant they valued the autonomy while governing those peoples and did not attempt to polonize them for the most part.

You can tell the same about Russia who had their own periods of independence for other nations for Finland for example. It goes back and forth. The process of polonizition or russification is quite different from allowing autonomy it's more of cultural aspect of imposing your culture, language and rules on others.

&gt;Imperialism is valuing power over other values; we sacrificed monarch  power in favor of nobles and their freedoms; we sacrificed the Russian  throne in favor of maintaining catholicism and language, we favored  religious tolerance and we favored autonomy over despotism; such are not  actions or values of an imperialist nation.

* How imperialism tied to the power of monarch is a mystery for me. US have a senate that have a bigger power than president doesn't make them less imperialistic. Britain also sacrificed monarch power, but they still were imperialistic. Imperialism is the idea of domination over others that's it. Poland was central figure in Central Europe and Eastern Europe at that time. Invading other countries, taking others land are imperialistic thing to do.
* Your religious tolerance indeed existed and also it had period of time of not so good. Like for example when Vasa III decided to convert Russia into Catholicism. Very tolerant.
* You haven't sacrificed Russian throne as you wasn't able to install anyone to it. [Władysław IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wladislaus_IV_of_Poland) refused to drop his claims and we got Smolensk Wars. Only after 20k gold in rubles he surrendered. Not the very noble ""to save language and catholicism"".

&gt;Zaolzie was a media stunt and I repeat - minor in the grand scheme of  things. The Czechoslovak occupation was only an excuse to take it; if it  was any other state or situation of Czechoslovak weakness I'm sure  Poland would've done the same thing. It was an unaccepted, one-city wide  territorial dispute and the way your quotes shape it out to be like its  more than a few thousand of people this pertained that were split  between the border. Again, while we *looked* like an accomplice, this move was not orchestrated in cooperation with Nazi Germany if the length of the keep is any evidence.

* I dunno what kind of media stunt it was, but looking at what happened in there i see that with time Poles lost all of their values that you was talking about in this city.

&gt;Correlation, but not the same thing. I stand by my opinion that Poland was not imperialist, at least by our definition.

I don't know what kind of imperialism definition you have in your mind, but **Imperialism** is a policy that involves a nation extending its power by the acquisition of lands by purchase, diplomacy or military force. So far Poland is indeed was an imperialistic.

That's how it worked when I was in the army (I was drafted in 2001, so it's possible things might have changed).

(2) Would you say it's a fair assessment that the German military in its current state is basically a sham operation?

3346,"You know, to get assylum in Germany you got to prove you have to fear your life in the place you are coming from. And they do not make it easy for you, thinking about that they (the government) even declared parts of Afghanistan as safe enough to deport people to, even though they do not want to specify where those magical safe spots are located... :-/ Or let us think about the repulsing term ""Wirtschaftsflüchtling"" (economical refugee) they love so much, meaning: If you are starving to death that is not a valid reason to stay in our country, please go back to where you came from and continue starving... You know, because those are just economical issues...

For ""normal"" immigrants, not refugees, you basically have to have money. This story of how we take every and all immigrants no matter what is simply wrong. The real failure of government in this regard is not enforcing those policies in a timely manner! Even if it is 100&amp;#37; sure you will not be allowed to stay in Germany, it can take years for you to get deported. That surely leads to many people feeling like just anyone can come here and stay forever, even though this is not the case.

But let us talk real reasons why AfD is getting so strong, here are my thoughts on that:

\- reflection of third reich in school is very narrow. Instead of teaching the broader message (aka. do not discriminate against people of other race, religion, political view...) you basically learn ""Jews are not evil"", and that is that. You can see this in the almost funny fact that AfD is the most pro-israel party we got here, although they are a bunch of nazis! So instead of making our people less racist, this kind of education leads to merely switching the target: ""Jews are cool, we got that now, but the Arabs and Africans are the real human filth!"" is summing up the viewpoint of most racists and racist parties we got here at the moment. Really really sad we missed the bigger opportunity here...

\- in the last decades of spd and cdu in government, the economical situatiion for the average worker and unemployed has worsen dramatically. We got the biggest low-income sector in the EU. The spd is just as neo liberal as the cdu is, neither of them is ""social"" or ""christian"" any more. Spd *still* defends Agenda 2010, just proving to everyone they did not learn a bit in the last decade. The afd being the declared enemy of those parties is enough for many people to vote for them, aka. the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Let me be clear: I do not think it is a good idea to go down this road (maybe go pirates instead? Just saying...) but never the less that is what many people do.

\- Cdu and csu mainly created many of the racist ressentiments themselves that the afd is taking advantages now. Basically nothing that went wrong in government ever was the fault of governing parties, but either the fault of unemployed people, foreigners etc. pp.. After years of doing so, now they wonder why the the party that goes ""so lets throw those assholes out!"" gets the vote?? Come on, you could have seen that coming....

\- Decreasing interest in politics leads to easier to manipulate people. Also something the old parties had a big part in, and welcomed it. Nothing as annoying as citizens watching your every move...

3430,"You might well be right.

However, there is another interesting point to consider: Historically CDU/CSU was always the party skeptical on immigration. Now we have the openly anti-immigration AfD and the newly immigration-skeptic FDP.

Which leaves only three parties that are not anti-immigration: SPD, Greens and LINKE.

SPD is the only one of these that is moderate in the sense that you don't have to subscribe to a particular worldview to agree with them.

A significant portion of the German electorate is *not* anti-immigration. SPD would risk turning them away.

For traditional SPD voters in West Germany, immigration is not the main issue that SPD is losing support over. SPD is losing support because they let themselves get railroaded by CDU/CSU to such a degree that you cannot with good conscience vote for them if you want to vote *against* the CDU/CSU agenda.

Curiously, your suggestion for a political left-right mix might come about in the form of DIE LINKE. Right now they are extremely pro-immigration but there is a very contentious battle being fought within the party and there is a realistic chance that they will swerve to a strong anti-immigration stance in order to placate voters in East Germany.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/8xg1hk/germany_afd_overtakes_spd_making_it_the_second/e248kia/,zombiepiratefrspace,1531213798

&gt;But we’re not in that world. And because we’re not in that world, every year the United States of America basically sends about a half a trillion dollars a year offshore in the form of a trade deficit. This is something that’s not supposed to happen in the Ricardian trade model. Let me say that again. This is not what is supposed to happen in the Ricardian trade model, which my colleagues in economics and folks in the media and everybody in between love to cite as the free trade model: “gains from trade, everybody wins.” In the Ricardian trade model, you can never have these persistent deficits because of things like currency adjustments, right? But we have them. We’re shipping off a half a trillion dollars a year. We are, as President Trump has said, the piggy bank of the world. And the reason why this happens is because countries around the world do not engage in free, fair, reciprocal and balanced trade. We have, for example, a trade deficit with China, which accounts for about half of the problem. But, at the same time, the European Union is about $151 billion in 2017 in trade deficit in goods: that’s about 20 percent of the problem. And then you have Japan and Mexico, with about another 18 percent of the problem.

&gt;If you look at these different countries, they all managed to gain advantage over this kind. I don’t call it competitive advantage. I just simply say advantage over this country in different ways. Germany, for example, which sells us three cars for every one we sell to them, has a tariff on autos, which is four times higher than ours. Japan, which has very low tariffs, sells us over 100 cars for every one we sell them. Extraordinary! And the problem there is non-tariff barriers. So all the president is trying to do with his trade policy is to level the playing field. And we would love to live in a world where the rest of the world caught up to us: I don’t know if you know this, but the United States of America has among the lowest tariff and non-tariff barriers in the world.

3781,"&gt; 12K GNI/capita is low by developed standards...at yet globally that means 'high-income'.

Why do you think PPP was invented? If you have high nominal income but high unemployment (especially for youth) as Italy does and relatively high prices, then your de facto standard of living differential is lower compared to poorer countries than nominal would indicate. 

For instance, it is not clear at all if the average Italian high-school dropout is better off than his or her counter-part in Czechia. The latter is much more likely to find a job, and even if he gets a lower salary he also has lower prices. Furthermore, Czechia has lower income inequality. Italy's GNI per capita is considerably higher than Czechia's in nominal terms but in PPP it is much closer and Czechia is gaining.

&gt; we should also appreciate how fortunate we are to be born in said high-income nations. 

Angus Deaton has shown how many (poor) communities in some rich countries are actually *worse* off than some of the poor villagers in places like India. His example was poor people in Appalachia and similar places in the US. This is because community bonds in such places are very broken and fragile, whereas in India you often have an entire village network. This means that risk is pooled much more widely in India than in these broken communities in the US. Plus even if nominal income of the poor in the US is much higher, their costs often exceed their income at any rate, so the actual difference in *de facto* struggling is minimal. And, as Deaton pointed out, probably worse because their support network is weaker.


In short, these numbers can be and often are quite misleading.

3825,"&gt; I don't know enough about French politics to gauge the reasonableness of these measures.

You should have highlighted the 1st and 2nd parts then. The 3rd part is fine, the 4th too. The latter two have long been on the table, and a variant of \#3 limiting mandates in a different way has already been implemented by IIRC the previous legislature.

There are other measures that are terrible, such as limiting the right to propose amendment based on \# of MEP (i.e. opposition parties, which most need to amend laws proposed by the government or majority, become limited) and giving control of the Assemblée's calendar to the government, including the part that traditionally belongs to the opposition.

France has one of the fewest \# of MPs per inhabitant in Europe, IIRC. Parliament is already very fast, especially under Macron; an issue that makes doing parliamentary work difficult for anything but the majority and the first opposition party. It will become even harder to keep up as you reduce \# of MP.

So opposition parties are limited in at least 3 ways: Less amendments, no control of the calendar, increased speed but lower \# of MP.

15% proportional is supposed to strengthen opposition, but only in appearance, the above rules coupled with existing ones ensure that it should be mostly cosmetics.

I don't know if he will get everything in. When the President wants something for real, he gets it, but changes in the Constitution are a special case because the Senate is not necessarily owned by the President, unlike the Assemblée. (The current Senate is dominated by the right wing, with absolute majority located right to centre right. It's where Macron sits but he aims to suffocate the main right wing party so the relationship is hard to predict. Opposition in appearance and agreement under cover is a thing.)

&amp;nbsp;

In other bad news, at some point he wanted to change the notion of ""Social Security"" to ""Social Protection"", which translates to weakening it in its constitutional foundations. It seems that he backed down early when seeing it would be terribly received, but only on the word change. He still intends to make it social protection somehow by changing something in the Constitution; I don't know how things will be like yet.

&amp;nbsp;

One good news is that our Ecology minister with a special, kind of privileged role in the government (in theory...) got a line in the 1st or 2nd article of the Constitution, which is significant. (i.e. it could have been useless in another article) The line for now says that the State has a duty to fight climate change and protect biodiversity. However the minister didn't get what he initially aimed for, which was a duty of *getting results*, the word used is different in legal jargon and that reduces the constitutional duty of the State. Still, a duty to act, enshrined so high in the Constitution, is good.

&amp;nbsp;

As for the discourse Macron is having, it is being held in Versailles, symbol of the Monarchy, in front of the two houses of Parliament, who have no right to answer. The President talks, then leaves, and the Parliament just comments alone. It was barely ever used until now. Sarkozy used that power once when he was elected (the press yelled at him); Macron wants to do it once every year. He is fond of monarchy, sometimes saying ""The French mourn for a monarch"", other times enjoying on a personal level the company of our last remaining monarchist (and rather segregated) politician de Villiers, etc. But that's his stance for France only. For Europe, he's some kind of federalist in ideals, a mainliner in practise, and a neoliberal in ideology with a hard stance on immigration, and a right wing ""ethos"" (according to him).",,/r/europe/comments/8x8ucr/macron_to_address_french_parliament_on/e23jfbf/,_Handsome_Jack,1531185260

3897,"Ukraine's arms manufacturer RPC Fort bought a contract to product arms developed by IMI locally. Before the Russian invasion those Israeli weapons were in use by the Ukrainian military, particularly its special forces.

Since the war Ukraine's special forces were decimated. In the reorganisation of their military Ukraine integrated the various militias (or National Defence Battalions) into their regular military to better regulate them. Some of those units became Special Forces, and as such were armed as per those requirements.

Israel is providing aid to Ukraine, and being that Ukraine is one of those countries who uses IMI's products, its reasonable that as part of military aid Israel sends over that type of armament as its what the soldiers are already equipped with.

So the result is that Ukrainian soldiers who's comrades already had locally produced Tavors are now being armed with Israeli made Tavors. Some of those soldiers happened to formerly be part of the National Defence Battalions. These militias, relying on nationalism to draw recruits (in a very nationalist conflict given the country's in a state of civil war) were drawn from various groups, though particularly football fans given the game's ties to nationalism in that part of the world. The result being that the NDF had Far-Right members, as one would expect.

The thing about the Azov Battalion (now Azov Regiment) is that whilst it had a basis in Nationalist ideology, in practice (despite what the media wants to say) that isn't what defined them day to day. Yes, there's a load of Nazis in the NDF, but Azov in particular didn't let that be the only criteria for recruitment. They were known as the best NDF unit serving at the time, so were very picky over who they let in - typically recruiting guys with military experience. So they were in the curious position for instance of having a couple of Israeli members, despite the media portraying them as all Neo-Nazis (and say ignoring the backing they were getting from certain Jewish oligarchs). Soldiers joined the group, regardless of its members viewpoints, as they knew it was the best, and chose to set those views aside in order to fight with competent soldiers with good leadership (instead of a bunch of drunks armed with barely functional WWII era guns. ...They were pulling German guns out of storage to fight this war you know. Which oddly enough I'm not aware of Azov ever using).

Ukraine's had issues reigning in Far Right groups ever since the war. They restructured their military and as part of that attempted to crack down on these elements. Azov lost a load of guys as part of this, though they maintained their Nationalist child organisations. In reality though, Azov played more to paganism than some similar groups. Rather the Right Sector group are the ones currently going about holding the torch lit rallies and beating up minorities. See Azov learned how to play politics. They now have the fame and fortune afforded by a Spetsnaz unit, and have members in position of power. They don't want to mess things up by overtly doing shady crap.

However, that's not have the news portrays them and instead puts them in the same boat as groups like the Right Sector. Members of Azov still have deplorable views, but they group as a whole seems fairly pragmatic - putting winning the war over ideology.

This article brings to mind a similar one from recently. It was reported that the Ukrainian government was sending money to Far Right groups. In reality what had happened was that a single Ukrainian politician had put money into a pool for teaching organisations to draw funds from. One of those organisations happened to hold Far Right views and hadn't been removed from the pool for whatever reason. As a result the media reported on it as the government supporting Nazis, which was partly true, but that failed to cover what had actually happen.

TLDR: Ukraine already uses Tavor. Israel sent them more Tavors. The guys who use Tavors there are usually Spetsnaz. One Spetsnaz group has Far Right leanings (though not everyone in the group does), so that means Israeli's ""Arming Neo-Nazis"".",Scotland,/r/europe/comments/8xhydw/rights_groups_demand_israel_stop_arming_neonazis/e23lul1/,Wyrmalla,1531187015

In Finnish, “rapu” means crab. “rappu” means stairwell / set of stairs, a common way to divide the apartments in a building (e.g “I live at number 45, stairwell A”). When you pluralise a word in Finnish, you add a “t” to the end of the word (“rapput”) and any double consonants (“pp”) decline / compress into a single consonant (“raput”).

Regarding your TAX CUTS DID NOT HELP!!

Lets use one of your sources

http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/republican-tax-cuts-not-working-out-the-gop-intended

The source
&gt;Business Insider reported yesterday, for example, “A new survey published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta in conjunction with Stanford University and University of Chicago Booth School economists shows [the measures in the new Republican tax plan] have done little to bolster corporate investment plans.”

http://www.businessinsider.com/tax-cuts-fail-to-boost-corporate-investment-plans-fed-survey-shows-2018-3

Literally on the heading of the story

&gt;Trump claimed the tax bill would lead to a huge boost in business spending — but there's no sign of it yet

&gt;The survey shows some three-quarters of executives had made no spending plans at all in response to the passage of the tax cuts.


So your claim that it only helped rich corporations is already blown out of the water according to your sources. Fake News if you will. The other one I checked out was sourcing an internal poll. WTF.

Below the NATO-mandated level of 2%, despite years in which to ramp up spending. 

&gt;3. It benefits mostly U.S. logistics and strategic positioning all over the world. 

I'm not claiming the USA isn't the principal party benefitting, but it also undergirds the entire world order that also benefits Western Europeans. The USA reaps most of the direct security benefits, but Western European nations still prosper in a world where another nation provides them with arguably the highest level of security ever enjoyed by a state that isn't a remote island. They also share in all of the economic benefits.

I'm not a cheerleader for the US government, but it's annoying to see people who are enjoying the same benefits from our govt's actions sit back and shit on us because their governments aren't doing (most) of the dirty work. Especially from people who are from places like Germany, which has been arguably the single biggest recipient of US help both direct and indirect. 

There's no moral superiority to be found with the American government (despite what plenty of my countrymen believe) but there's not exactly much moral high ground in being the guy standing behind the mugger who still gets a share of the spoils.

American voters see the US spending over $400 million per year to lead NATO contributions (at roughly 3.6% our GDP), yet we're probably the least affected country in NATO in the case of a war. What makes Americans even more mad is that countries like Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Luxembourg and a few others stand the most to gain from NATO, yet do not spend the 2% target on defense. Americans know the 2% it's not a law to be in NATO, but the overarching feeling among voters (or Trump supporters) is why should we prop up something that will never EVER benefit us, when those who we're protecting won't even pay a fair share.

4286,"Ah now you're back to making LOTS of sense again (as per the very first comment you made on this thread). It's strange - you write lots of good intelligent stuff and then threw in some salty less well-thought-through stuff in (were you actually trying to work and just quickly threw it out?!)

Firstly, all your first bits (paras 1-6) I agree with...
... with the exception of the part about me ""ironically you're buying into the romanticisation of Anglo-Saxon Britain used by English nationalists"". 
No, that's what makes this good banter/debate. Since many English do either buy in to that or are ignorant about the extent of (Norman) French influence. National creation myths.

Secondly though, when you've started talking about Scotland you're making good analogies but perhaps assuming I disagree with your first parts - I don't, I think they are spot on - and/or that I buy in to Scotland's own creation myths. (Heroic guy frees nation bullshit etc.). Nope I don't buy in to that bullshit and I agree entirely. In fact it (Scottish history) is even more complex than you outline and even better analogies with the Anglo-Normans wrapping themselves in the English flag and/or being portrayed by romantic nationalists as national heroes rather than just the elites doing there thing. William Wallace was Scoto-Norman and wrapped himself in Scottish freedom/nationalism to further his own ends as a baron.

Thirdly:

&gt;Also think about this, the Angles and Saxons were not from Britain either! So where does the logic end?
&gt;TL;DR You're joking in a way which suggests you think this is kind of unique but really it makes us no more French or ruled by French than the fact that the Angles and Saxons were German! The point is that all nations have these kind of things happen. The Normans did not defeat the English, they defeated Anglo-Saxon rulers, and what modern English society is encorporates both those Germanic and Frankish roots (with others too) and gives us what we now today consider English.

You keep misinterpreting/misquoting me: I have never said the English weren't English. All I have done is raise the connection and massive cultural influence of the Norman French. You're entirely agreeing and we are going round in circles!

To highlight one point though:
&gt;The point is that all nations have these kind of things happen. 

No, I think the English/British history of first Anglo-Saxon/Norse and then Norman complete annexation and cultural takeover is pretty exceptional. The extent of it. (I agree that all nations have influences etc). Partially I think driven by being a large island and a rich prize. That's what makes this all so interesting.

Fourth:

&gt;kind of sinking to the level of the nationalist outlook he's trying to mock

I'm sorry? Banter with a serious point about Norman influence and I'm sinking to a nationalist level. 
You've read a fucking lot between the lines there mate....
I refer you to my full agreement of your earlier parts. 

Bonus, to further your linguistic education given your complete underestimation of the difference between Old English and Modern English and that this is NOTHING like the difference between Old and Modern French (one of your less good/educated parts in contrast to most of above).

Firstly comparison of French:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_of_Saint_Eulalia#Text
Even visually you can see that the old French is very close. A thousand years later. A little bit occasionally more Latin or Germanic. But mostly just evolved a little bit and different spelling.

Now English - Beowulf:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English#Beowulf
There a direct translation next to it and a more proper translation in to modern English below.
Also the Lord's Prayer too.

Old English is completely *incomprehensible*. In fact even Middle English is pretty incomprehensible!!

That's actually a good reason, but the article nor SPR makes no mention of it, so unlikely, and of course they wouldn't be provided housing in such manner

&gt;They have had their request denied but either have challenged the decision or are waiting to do so.

Then they wouldn't have to resort to this, nor would SPR provide them housing here, as they would have other housing available to them. 

&gt;Also. Housing someone who is in Finland illegally isn't against the law. It only becomes illegal if you're hiding them from the authorities and since the request to house these people is coming from the city housing them isn't illegal.

I don't have numbers, but a vast majority of 60+ year olds in rural areas are dirt poor with no hope of anything getting better within their lifetimes. Give these people +40% pensions (which isn't that much in the grand scheme of things, since they were dirt poor anyway) and you just got yourself voters for life.

EDIT: And what makes things complicated, is if the youth rises up and votes for someone else, that party won't raise pensions, they might even go down a bit (and not only pensions, all populists moves would have to be undone to save the economy).

England was only unified in mid 900s, suffered Nordic invasion subsequently and then Norman Invasion in 1066. Not much more than a hundred years of uncertainty. 

Fuller extract from Wikipedia

“This brought about the political unification of England, first accomplished under Æthelstan in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by Eadred in 953. A fresh wave of Scandinavian attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard in 1013 and again by his son Cnut in 1016, turning it into the centre of a short-lived North Sea Empire that also included Denmark and Norway. However, the native royal dynasty was restored with the accession of Edward the Confessor in 1042.

A dispute over the succession to Edward led to the Norman conquest of England in 1066, “

4447,"Considering the Italian tendency of huge swings between elections, I see a center-left government as the most probable future option.
Renzi dropped from 40% to 20% in matter of months because he made a decree to give money to a random bank in Tuscany. Salvini will surely meet a similar fate like Berlusconi before him. Italian politics is boring because it is always the same things happening over and over again... 
Former Minister Carlo Calenda has a plan for the foundation of a ""Republican Front"", a new party that would substitute PD with a focus on innovation, social justice and pro-europeism. While the proposal has been rejected for now, as I said the government is very unstable and the political scenario is hot and changeable. 

Also if you prefer the center right, Forza Italia will probably be lead by EU parliament leader Antonio Tajani after Berlusconi's retirement. While it would still be ""the party of Berlusconi"", getting rid of that creepy old man would be a great step in creating a believable moderate fifth party in Italy. 

On the far left LeU (Free and Equals) could fill the gap left by M5S right shift, but this is pretty unlikely as the only charismatic young and believable politician in LeU is Giuseppe Civati and although a great politician who has done very concrete things such as taking refugees in his own home he has been fairly absent from the political scene.

We're throwing some ideas around at the moment, simply going ""let's scrap it all pictures are fair game all the time!"" again is not the solution that I think is right though.

Yeah, the problem is the circlejerk mentality, the size of /r/Europe these days and the layout of Reddit. If it was only the occasional OC picture it'd be cool enough but as soon as someone posts a picture of a statue (or whatever) it turns into a spam fest of ""Statues of Europe"" and completely takes over the sub.
Reddit's sub-layout also means that a sub with a million subscribers has the same size front page as a sub with 10 subscribers which makes it very easy for some circlejerk to completely drown out everything else.

 
The new rules has helped a bit but the issue is still the same as always, now it's just only during the weekends which still sucks even though it's obviously better than it happening every day. The sub is still worthless on weekends now as you have to dig through so much spam to find anything interesting with a good discussion.

I agree that a complete ban of picture isn't ideal but I just don't see any other solution if you want to keep the sub worth using every day.

4621,"&gt;You are inventing a new English language

No. I just point you to the plain meaning of the sentence in question.

&gt;The only way to **aim to reach** X budget by Y date is to have a budget that is X by Y date. 

Are you doing this on purpose? The declaration does not use the phrase 'aim to **reach**' but 'aim to **move towards**'. This is achieved by making a spending plan that is closer to a 2% spending by 2024 than it was in 2014. 

The 'move towards' the target part means that you don't promise to reach it by the time in question - that would be 'reaching' - but that you try to be closer to the target in 2024 than in 2014.  

The aiming part means that if the economy were to grow much faster than expected the actual spending could even be lower as a percentage of GDP than the 2014 levels.

A percentage of GDP is after all a moving target and a military spending increase is a long term process.

&gt;also was not fully quoted. I stated that Germany has to increase budgets in the future, not right now today.

I did not contest your opinion about the future action Germany has to take, just the factual wrong part:

&gt;**Germany isn't spending enough on military according to their promised commitments and that is objectively a fact.** German military funding has to rise in the future.

His report was destroyed by Kovesi and the Supreme Magistrate's Court, for not having any evidence of wrong doings and being based entirely on political declarations, propaganda articles from their outlets, etc. As a result, the president refused to revoke Kovesi based on that report. 

Then the minister of Justice asked the PSD controlled Constitutional Court (they are politically named and most of them, including the president are from PSD, ALDE, UDMR that are forming a coalition) to tell their opinion on the existence of a constitutional conflict between the government through the justice minister and the president. The Constitutional Court, instead of simply observing the existence or not of a conflict, abusively imposed the president to revoke the DNA chief prosecuter and not only that, but it also stated that the president should sign the revocation decree right away. This is something unheard of in the history of the Constitutional Court.

At the same time, the PSD lead coalition, with support from the hungarian party UDMR, started voting very fast a lot of changes to the penal code and the justice laws, basically trying to kill the possibility of convicting people for many crimes. Including a special article to save their leader Dragnea from prison, by redefining the abuse of office. These changes, once implemented would pretty much legalize a mafia state.

In order to force the president's hand, the PSD coalition threatened with his abusive impeachment, their main pretext being the refusal to ''respect a Constitutional Court ruling''. If suspended, they could have imposed one of their leaders as interimate president and immediately sign all the changes to the penal code and justice laws and pretty much killing the anticorruption fight. The referendum against the president would have not passed, but all they wanted was to solve their problems anyway. It should be noted that the same PSD coalition has been ignoring a CCR ruling and a valid referendum result for almost 10 years now, nothing happening to them.

Today, the president signed the revocation decree. Which is a major moral blow to the anticorruption prosecuters and justice system in general and leaves the president very vulnerable to other attacks of PSD through its Constitutional Court. He already lost some of his powers this way.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/8x9l0f/laura_codruta_kovesi_chief_prosecuter_of_romanias/e21t2t3/,vladgrinch,1531127571

Or make it less attractive to hire EU workers by making sure employers can't take advantage of their unfamiliarity with labour laws by making them work 50-60 hours a week.

Sanders was a joke candidate, only in echochambers like reddit do people think he would win, or people who don't understand that Republicans and Trump went easy on him on purpose, so as to demoralise his supporters and dissuade them from joining the Clinton camp. That's why he had higher polling numbers than Hillary in some of the hypothetical 'Trump vs Sanders' polls. Those polls are in a vacuum. In a real situation there would be months of FOX propaganda machine, Russian email hacks, 'gotcha' moments, stupid slip ups that media would blow out of proportion -- remember that triumphant yeee-haw that ended that Dem in 2000?

Clinton was a reasonable and consummately skilled and qualified candidate that people rejected because people are fucking tards who don't know when they have it good. Change and wanting to 'shake things up' is stupid when it's gonna be your neck on the line soon.

According to The Economist, four out of five hedge fund managers [expected](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2016/06/30/prophets-and-profiteers) the UK to remain, though. The ones that didn't, made loads.

&gt;FOUR out of five hedge-fund managers had expected Britain to vote to remain in the European Union, according to a poll by Preqin, a data firm. But a handful saw Brexit coming and invested accordingly. They made hundreds of millions by betting against assets that were likely to suffer from an Out vote. Crispin Odey’s London-based fund, which manages around $10 billion and has had a terrible year, jumped nearly 15% on the day after the vote. That was thanks to short positions on the shares of a number of British firms (including Aberdeen, an asset manager, and Berkeley Group, a builder) and a big investment in gold. Others, such as Atlantic Investment Management, prospered by betting against sterling, which fell this week to its lowest value against the dollar since 1985.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/8x7zst/super_wealthy_pocket_brexit_millions_newsnet/e21kqxl/,Leocto,1531113675

4859,"&gt; alt-right rhetoric

How would you define the ""alt-right""  (and by extension ""alt-right rhetoric"")  ?




I'm asking because I've known at least two ""alt-right(s)"" to exist (pre/post 2016 US election) , with the former being an undefined ""big tent / no leaders just frogs"" group(s) that only about 10-20% could be defined as real nasty Nazi wannabes -- with an equal or more numbers saying that the majoraty of the ""George Bush type Republicans"" in politics are not for them, but they liked Trump, and were looking for a more dynamic , more modern conservatism, one that didn't live or die on gay marriage or abortion .



And then there's the latter that emerged (with the help of the media) post election, that said ""no-no, we're the ""real alt right"" "" , and their world view caused a massive exodus from the ""big tent"" , while also giving the media a ""face"" to the (now much smaller) movement .



Tl;dr -- pre-election = Alternative Right , post election = something akin to White Nationalist but not quite (with some odd ideas in general &amp; misconceptions about Europe in particular) , and Nazis in all but name to those who know nothing about the evolution (or rather devolution) of this movement .

4914,"Globalization has done nothing but make the rich richer and ruin the American working and middle class.  Trump is bringing it all down, and if one of the casualties is American elites' dream of empire,  then all the better.

Trump's inaugural  speech:

For too long, a small group in our nation's Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. 

Washington flourished -- but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered -- but the jobs left, and the factories closed.
The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.

That all changes -- starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.

It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country.

What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people. January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.

Everyone is listening to you now.

You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before. At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.

Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves. These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.

But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.

This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.
We are one nation -- and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.

The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.

For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military; we've defended other nation's borders while refusing to defend our own; and spent trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.

We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.
One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind.

The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.

But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.

From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.

From this moment on, it's going to be America First.

Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.
I will fight for you with every breath in my body -- and I will never, ever let you down.

America will start winning again, winning like never before.
We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.
We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.

We will get our people off of welfare and back to work -- rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.

We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American.

We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world -- but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.

We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.

We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones -- and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.

At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.",,/r/europe/comments/8x02fs/transatlantic_ties_hang_in_the_balance_as_trump/e21e2ia/,morphogenes,1531106147

4945,"I did not say they are mistreated innocent pious people. Let me set this straight - I find the ideology of radical islamists (or any kind of religious fundamentalists for that matter) repulsive. But this is not about what they want and whether I like it or not. Ok, they are anti-system, they would like to change the status of quo and form a different political/ideological establishment.

They are not the only force in the world with this goal. In all western countries, there are parties and movements with this goal. They just differ in how exactly they would like to change the system. In my country, we still have a communist party. They haven't reformed much since 89. They still get around 10% of the votes despite the fact that they are not hiding that they haven't changed their core ideology. If they theoretically got in power, they would change the economic and social model, causing big damage the country. In other countries, there are many other fiercly anti-establishment parties that would change the fundaments of liberal democracy should they have the chance.

Despite that, we are not throwing these people to jail or purge them from their jobs in the public sphere, unless they actually do something illegal or unless the job includes working with classified information and they having an access to that could put the national interests in risk.

People can have political/religious views that you find unacceptable but that's not a reason for personal persecution, unless they act on those views in a way that is illegal.

Especially not if the goal behind this persecution aren't any worries about the secular character of Turkey, but in fact a desire to get rid of political competitors. Which is what really is Erdogan's motivation. He had no problems with working with these people when it suited him. He turned on them only when they started to be a threat to him.

""It is important to note that gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder. The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition.""

&gt; Not being a medical professional I can't make any recommendations about the treatment options, or whether they are necessary.

Depending on the country, it seems the medical professionals are opting to either psychotherapy or gender reassignment -- thankfully, in the age of the internet, this isn't very hard to find out. And in the UK, where the doctor in question works, the latter is not an uncommon option. So the good doctor is not just going against the law here, but also the work of his own colleagues. Other medical professionals.

You realize that both of us emigrated from Europe to America? It's not like our history and culture started out from zero when we got here 400 years ago. Europe does not have more culture than North America does just because it's older.

&gt;Some of the most prevalent aspects of American popular culture to me are its anti-intellectualism, mundanity, bodily pleasures, greed. Quite simply, it appeals to our baser instincts.

You realize that you are talking about American POPULAR culture. French POPULAR culture is just as stupid as American popular culture. Have you seen any French movies?? 

The US is not anti-intellectual. American culture just thinks that a lot of the stuff that is said in France is pseudo-intellectual  and irrational or unscientific.

Something like ""white genocide"" is understood as a nutcase conspiracy theory since a while. Talking about ""ethnic replacement"" or misquoting the ""replacement migration""-term the UN uses was hip for a while - suddenly it's ""demographic change"" or concern for the ""recognizable cities"" until the public catches on there.

What you always need to keep in mind (for a thread in any direction) is that ""what the sub thinks"" isn't what you usually see. You see what the *very first* commenters and voters think. If the thread reaches /r/all that will always be what a thread stays like. If it stays on /r/Europe it will sometimes shift over a few hours, but in general will also be tilted.

While we have no idea how bad organized things are in this regard cases where we gain some insight into these topic don't look too amazing. There was a case in Germany recently where people ""infiltrated"" an alt-right network that regularly brigaded Facebook and Twitter with tens of thousands of users for example.

What we *do* notice is that some viewpoints seem to be consistently more active early on in a threads lifespan, but that's the extent of it. Help in this regard is always appreciated.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/8wsisk/we_are_the_mods_of_reurope_ask_us_anything/e20sije/,rEvolutionTU,1531084108

Actually you did:

Considering the subject, assuming you by ""freedom"" mean ""right"" is not unreasonable.

&gt;  To say that more freedom on paper is always objectively better is an oversimplification of society (and in case you say that you haven't actually made that claim, why are you making this whole argument at all? Either you're indeed arguing that the way the US does things is better, or you're just arguing for the sake of it).

Actually I am going to make that argument. I've consistently said that America is more free than Europe. If you think Europe should not be as free as the US, that's fine by me as long as you're honest about it. But I do think that America is better than Europe because they have more freedom and a better constitution. However, what I've seen in this thread is European constantly trying to deny that they are less free when they demonstrably are. My personal feeling is that they have an inferiority complex towards america and feel the need to prove that they are just as free, even when they are not. 

As for why this thread? Well I spend a lot of time waiting for software to compile and it's fun to watch europeans do mental gymnastics to try to prove that they are just as free as the US.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/8x05ht/dear_italians_you_need_to_stay_strong_this_is/e20lys2/,mjk100,1531077456
5380,"&gt; You said that there is no difference in context when a person is joking or is serious. That is a pretty significant thing already.

It's not enough to conclude that I don't understand any humour, that's a ridiculous assumption to make.

&gt;As long as the person understands that they are wrong and nobody in the process of telling the joke is offended, there is nothing wrong with that.

And how do you know that everybody in your audience will be okay with what you're saying or not take it as meaning racist views they normally wouldn't share are okay? I dated a rape victim a few years ago and a friend of mine, not knowing her history, made a rape joke in front of her. That wasn't okay, and making light of rape isn't okay even if you're nowhere near a rape victim. The same is true of mocking people for their disabilities or their race. If you fully understand that you're acting shitty and wouldn't act that way in from of a person you're joking about then you know what you're doing is wrong.

5382,"&gt; Hungarians conquered the area of Transylvania somewhere between the XI-XIII century.

By 1003 Transylvania was part of Hungary.

&gt; The szekelys eventually lost some of their privileges and got gradually assimilated into the hungarian nation.

Székelys were Hungarians that very likely appeared in the Carpathians in the first wave of the Hungarian conquest. They were assigned with special rights in exchange of military services, these things made them to hold a separate identity.

There was no assimilation for Székelys, neither for Cumans who much later on settled in Hungary.

Louisiana was the only south state that had a significant number, but even that was not that large. When Napoleon sold all that land to the US in 1803, there were only like 60,000 people in Louisiana, not all of whom spoke French. The vast majority of the land was uninhabited.


Once Louisiana became part of the US then there was a big immigration from Germany, Ireland, and the rest of the US. Most of those people spoke English. 

The Cajuns are different though. They lived in more isolated rural areas and they kept on speaking French until around World War II.

Then I'll try help you understand. 

Look at the Germans, or even the Japanese. You won't meet more humble groups of people, their identities heavily defined by the terrible actions of their ancestors not so long ago, their crimes acknowledged and their people very respectful of others now. 

And then you have the British. Huge chunks of their society even to this day celebrate their empire, their domination of people all over the world, it's a reason to boast for them. Humble is certainly not a word you'd use to describe them. 

Neither the Japanese, nor the Germans, nor the British of today had anything to do with the atrocities of their people, but one of them treat their war criminals as heroes, adjust their history to glorify themselves, and sweep the famines they caused or the millions of people they've killed under the rug, because they were the ""good guys"" that won and got to write their own version of history.

They're not hated in the context of football, they're hated in the context of who they continue to be as a people, and  then they seem to just happen to send their worst to football games.

The second being, just as you said, the banks have to make up for the lost revenue *somewhere*, and it could result in incremental increases in fees for mid-tier banking clients.  (Higher-tier clients often do not pay lots of fees, since the bank is already making a profit off the deposited funds in other ways, and that would not change).

5735,"&gt;This is precisely what Trump is threatening to do and Europeans are shitting their pants over it.

Perhaps some Europeans, but I'm not. I'm actually with Trump on this point. Europe *should* step up. And I think a lot of Europeans wouldn't mind a decrease in US military presence either. Some countries would mind, mainly CEE countries, for obvious and justifiable reasons. But some of those countries *do* meet NATO standards (2%), so the US could stay there.

&gt;A military isn't useful? Without it, you don't have a country.

I admit, I should have been clearer. Of course, the military is useful *and* necessary. I'm not denying that. I'm saying that *overspending* isn't, like the US is doing. You do know that the US spends as much money on its military as the *next [8](https://www.statista.com/chart/8309/defense_-the-us-outspends-these-countries-combined/) to [12](http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2018/apr/24/bernie-s/sanders-says-us-military-spending-bigger-next-12-n/) countries combined*?

That's ridiculous and that's something I don't ever want to happen over here. *That* kind of money could be used on more useful things.

But, of course, every country needs a military and the way I see it, the EU needs one as well, in whatever form.

&gt;I know, this is why Europeans are fighting so hard to keep American defense subsidies. Military is expensive, and without a sucker to pay for you, you'd have to make cuts to the welfare state. The prospect is terrifying.

Of course, you'd have to make some cuts somewhere, but if you do it responsibly, it won't have to be terrifying. Especially not if EU member states would decide to cooperate more than they do right know. That could be a huge cut in defense costs.

But besides that, you seem to be *completely* ignoring that the US *wants* to stay in Europe, or at least wanted for the past decades. And not just in Europe, but all over the world. *You* are not without blame yourself either. And that's something I don't hear much coming from Trump and his base. It's always someone else's fault, but your country chose to have military presence all over the world as well. 

*[This](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-usa-defence/u-s-warships-pass-through-taiwan-strait-amid-china-tensions-idUSKBN1JX0QY)* just happened yesterday, under Trump's presidency.

The supply lines so far into the Soviet Union became incredibly difficult to maintain, tanks could not be replaced and the Luftwaffe started to lose superiority. The german industry was incredibly inefficient, producing advanced vehicles but at a slow rate. Bit to mention streamlined production wasn't possible either due to oil.

Germany started Barbarossa with some of it's tank divisions having half the required tanks or less. The German anti tank weapons were subpar and not optimal in the slightest. Now we get even further into the core of the issue, the Soviet Union produced way more by the end of 1942 than Germany did. Streamlined production of T34's and the new airforce gave the soviet union a crushing material superiority.

The German army invaded with the assumption that the Soviet Union would capitulate once Moscow was taken. Which is a fairy tail by itself, as Stalin nor the Soviet people would have any intention to surrender.

Let's get further in to Germany's issues, it's homeland industry and infrastructure was being devastated by allied air raids, Italy was collapsing quickly and the US had joined the war with their infinite resources.

To be clear the thing that stopped the Germans was the red army, the poor supply routes and the unprepared nature of the wehrmacht.

I may be a bit late to this thread, but I've always been told to keep away from 6-cyl diesel. It's the 4-cyl (200/220CDI taxis) and 5-cyl (VW R5, 270CDI) diesels you find with high mileage, the 6-cylinders have all depreciated like crazy for good reason. 

What's the point of buying bigger diesel engines if all you're after is torque? Weight will impact your ability to tow your boat beyond that. I mean, it doesn't matter if it's a 220CDI or 350CDI if it's still a C-class rated for less than 1800kg tow-load with breaks. Better to get the C220CDI and rent a Sprinter when you need to tow, or prefer an E220CDI over a C350CDI.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/8wmidp/eu_to_sign_massive_free_trade_agreement_with_japan/e1zxkb1/,RassyM,1531048602

5803,"Yes, but practically everyone calls him a coward... A coward with a 'but' , or 'not a coward but traumatised by WWI until ____ and then yes, a coward'.

The issue is that by the time Poland was invaded, it was all over, Hitler broke every promise he made before, multiple times after his actions in Austria and Czechoslovakia. I understand that hindsight is 20/20 but even in his day everyone was crying out against his actions, enough so that he was replaced by Churchill, a person otherwise too unbalanced to serve as a PM, but in the dire times his attack dog persona made him a somewhat worthwhile choice. 

Moreover, UK and France were treaty bound to aid Poland. It is one thing to try to avoid war by ignoring others abrogating their treaties, but when you abrogate yours especially as such an eminent nation that made so many treaties, you're devaluing yourself quite precipitously. At that point he already declared war on Hitler, so even that one final leap was made, but after declaring war on Germany, his grand strategy was Sitzkrieg -- at a time when Germany had almost no defences in the West and zero capability to fight a two-front war (something which Stalin pointed out as far back as in 1938, Soviet intelligence was spying on Germany for a while now). 

He was most certainly a coward, because even when all hope of peace was shattered he still did nothing. And worst of all, he didn't even fight for the UK-French-Soviet Pact that would have actually prevented WWII and likely kept USSR in its borders (Stalin was very much a proponent of socialism in one country, unlike Trotsky - unless the countries were literally open and abandoned by a retreating enemy, his expansion was unlikely until much later).",Apparently Serbia according to /u/cLnYze19N,/r/europe/comments/8wtl2r/uks_government_12_key_principles_for_brexit/e1zuc1m/,Aemilius_Paulus,1531040876

Also this market raises the prices of rental real estate. a famous block between rossio and praça da figueira has been rotting for decades, it+s an eye sore, because property investors have been trying to buy it piece by piece, left it to rot, are evicting the tennants (now almost all closed, pastelaria suiça will close soon), they are trying to force the city hall to give them permission to build a hotel there. The block has been sold recently to another investment fund (of which rafael nadal is one of the investors) for 62 million euros, which is insane against any profitability they might get from any non hotel investment and even from a hotel investment.

5935,"&gt; The US based claim is not the patent dispute. 

Which was my point. You insisted that the patent case involved the allegedly stolen tech, when in fact nothing could be less certain. Patents are published. If Jinhua had gone and obtained a Chinese patent based on the stolen information, Micron's lawyers would be doing a very crappy job if they didn't add this patent to their complaint in the US at least as evidence of Jinhua's dastardly behaviour.

I can't read Mandarin either, but I've some experience in this sort of disputes. As I said, when it became evident that it was to be hit with a lawsuit in the US for stealing Micron's trade secrets, Jinhua certainly looked for leverage for an out-of-court settlement, and so chose from among its patent portfolio a patent which it could argue Micron was infringing (in such technology fields, everybody has plenty of patents, and everybody often unwittingly infringes a handful of the competition's patents). It's even quite likely that Jinhua's patent is a so-called ""utility model patent"", that is a short-term (ten years) patent that is granted without examination. Utility model patents are a (rather dubious) feature of Chinese patent law that China copied from...German patent law. Chinese companies file massive amounts of utility model patents, which they often use to hassle each other as well as foreign companies. Because utility model patents are granted quite rapidly, without any substantial examination, it's even quite likely that Jinhua filed it *after* it became evident that Micron was probably going to sue them, in order to gain some ammunition against Micron.

My point is that, regardless of the merits of each lawsuit, none of this adds up to a conspiracy by China's authorities, courts included, to cheat Micron. It rather shows one individual company (Jinhua) using all means available, fair and perhaps even foul, to enter a market with high technological barriers to entry, and another company (Micron) fighting back in court. I can assure you, this kind of battle is by no means limited to China.

&gt; I am relying on the reporting of several respected news sources regarding the patent dispute.

Knowing all too well how most journalists from ""respected news sources"" can't tell a patent from a trademark, I think that's a bit like relying on Helen Keller to report on the use of light and shadow by Caravaggio...

EDIT: In fact, [Jinhua's patent injunction appears to relate to solid state drives](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1109545.shtml) whereas Micron's trade secrets lawsuits relate to DRAM chips.

Although it wasn't specified, only a hard Brexit truly benefits the country. A soft Brexit is far too restrictive and leads us to be worse off than before.
