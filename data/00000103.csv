22,"I'll believe you, though as I said I can't look what vote was about what - there are 38 identically named votes in there, your being the latest.

I was being facetious - maybe a bit too much - with that sentence you quoted, but it generally was the sentiment. [Lewica was spouting some populisms](https://www.gazetaprawna.pl/artykuly/1463811,posiedzenie-sejmu-pandemia-koronawirusa.html) about how things must be done asap and how ""Poles don't care about rules, they care when the laws will be implemented"", also Zandberg said something about not falling for tribe mentality in such a time - all fine and dandy with no context, but we were talking about expanding Sejm's ability to make laws, and doing so in a way not seen in our law. That could - and if our constitutional court existed de facto, likely would - lead to issues with the legality of any vote, as de iure the required quorum would not be met.

And all it would take is to get every second seat filled - like in the public transport, vote for the changes, and leave. Or do it behind closed doors - since the Sala Kolumnowa vote was valid, it would too, and this time it would have support of some opposition parties. But we can, and should, expect them to work as usual - after all, it's not like there are any constitutional hindrances, and we're paying them to take the risk, not so they can make a sequel to Beck's trip to Romania.

At least they pushed the bit about allowing it only during the states extraordinary - but also during this weird creature we have now, the ""state of epidemic danger"". And since the latter allows elections, and changing the election laws\*, would you look at that - it happened.

24,"Well first of all I live quite close to Hungary and there is a huge cultural overlap between them and my region even though they speak such a different language to us it may as well be alien.

Second of all, from what I've heard there is more order in Hungary than here and it's a richer country so it would be trading up as well.

Thirdly because Westerners in this thread and this whole sub show how much they dislike us when threads like these come about. There is a big issue of xenophobia to Eastern European immigrants in Central and Western Europe which isn't taken seriously because we're white so we can't shout racism.

Fourthly there is a lot of support in here as well as the rest of EE for Orban's immigration policy and we certainly don't want to end up like Paris or similar big cities like that. We like our culture the way it is and have enough domestic leaches, we don't need more people of a completely different worldview straining the system. And it isn't about race or religion, I wouldn't want tens of thousands Americans (for example) coming suddenly to my country either. I'm fairly left leaning but most people here except the extreme leftists activists would agree on the issue of immigration. 

And finally the security of countries in our area is next to none. Which is really important. There's no terrorist threats, there is very little violent crime, the social safety net is pretty good and there is a sense of unity. 

Now having said all this there are of course quite a few negatives of living here and Orban's government seems quite nuts and right wing authoritarian which is against my political views. But there is a lot of issues in every country and I would definitely feel more safe and less foreign in Hungary then say Spain, France, UK, Belgium, Netherlands, etc.

PiS obviously wants the elections to go on as they have recently gained like 10 points in polls while the opposition is a joke.

Did the EU intervene in France when they recently had their elections by force? Is there EU intervention to save French democracy as yellow vests continue to be persecuted and demonstrate for over a year? 


&gt;Our public media have changed into propaganda machine brainwashing mostly senior and uneducated citizens (with great success, sadly).

Public television has always been a propaganda arm of the ruling governments. It was the case when PO was in power and now they’re complaining because it’s the case for PiS. 

&gt;Our goverment has wasted the times of prosperity to introduce new social security benefits that really seem like buying votes from the poorer and uneducated part of the society.

God forbid that they do something for people like farmers or families that have been prone to leaving Poland by the millions in the last couple of decades.

This is initially unacceptable in a modern society, but the cost of preventing and trying to contain it is utterly overwhelming. The damage to many economies will ensure seriously eroded health services for the foreseeable future, even when the virus has diminished. It is, however, down this route we have all been taken. How long can these measures be held in place? There's some wildly optimistic projections, but in reality it is likely to be 12-18 months min before a truly effective vaccine is ready. There won't BE recognisable economies left by that stage. And what happens if restrictions are lifted in the meantime? The virus will burst out all over again and it's back to square one.

We like to think the modern world is supreme over all threats. This proves how wrong is that assumption.

Controversial  part is that only those people and people in quarantine are allowed to  vote via post, other people even if they live with older people have to  go vote. No change for people living in foreign countries where some  cities have 10x more cases than entire Poland.

Poland  is current under the state of emergency due Covid-19, so that people  are only allowed to go outside for grocery / pharmacy or work - making  them to go vote either puts theirs health on risk or allow to spread  virus.

Even with current trend of increasing amount of infected people the Presidential election is planned to happen in May 2020.

But I see no evidence whatsoever of a nefarious plot on the part of the Germans or anyone else in the EU to get Spain to deindustrialize, nor is it in any way obvious to me that other countries even have the means to do so. 

The only connection between the EU and deindustrialization could be the introduction of the Euro. I don't know what the peseta did before changing to the Euro, but going into a monetary union where the currency is much stronger can make your export sectors take a hit if they are not used to competing under those circumstances. But if that is so, Spain should look in the mirror because the decision to join the Euro is something Spain decided for itself. It was not forced, as evidenced by the fact that Denmark and Sweden and the UK were also not in the Euro. Maybe Spain wanted to be in the Euro for political reasons, when it was economically not ready.

371,"**Article**:

A prominent member of the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday issued a highly critical statement on U.S. policy toward Kosovo.

Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 2008. Since than the country has been recognized by more than 110 countries, including the United States, but not by Serbia and its ally Russia.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, a Democrat, said there is something wrong with the U.S. foreign policy toward Kosovo and “we need to correct it.”

In his statement, Engel expressed his serious concerns “with the heavy-handed tactics the Trump administration is using with Prishtina,” Kosovo’s capital.

Engel was referring to State Department pressure on Prishtina, especially on the government of Prime Minister Albin Kurti, to lift tariffs the country had imposed on Serbia.

“This administration turned to economic penalties just a few short weeks after the Kurti government took office. Rather than letting a new government facing a pandemic staff its agencies and set up internal procedures, the U.S. contributed to a political crisis in Prishtina over the tariffs on Serbia,” Engel said.

On March 25, after only 50 days in office, the Kurti government did not survive a no-confidence vote in parliament, initiated by its ruling coalition partner, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK).

The government was dismissed following political bickering over whether to declare a state of emergency to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and after Kurti dismissed the LDK internal affairs minister, Agim Veliu.

Kurti’s government is expected to continue as a caretaker government, pending creation of a new government.

“There are good reasons for Kosovo to lift tariffs, mostly that they are hurting Kosovo more than they are providing leverage to reach a peace deal with Serbia,” Engel said.

“Regardless, tariffs are a legitimate tool of a sovereign nation. As such, they’ve been imposed around the world by [U.S.] President [Donald] Trump against friends and foes, alike, for economic and political reasons,” Engel said.

Engel said the Trump administration used “overbearing tactics with a friend which relies on our support” instead of working with Kurti government, “as it sought to work with the previous Kosovo government” to forge policies that promote lasting peace and prosperity.

“Strong-arming a small democracy is the act of a bully,” Engel said.

While Serbian diplomats are campaigning around the world to “derecognize” Kosovo’s independence, and Serbia is purchasing heavy weaponry from Russia and strengthening the relationship with Moscow, the pressure imposed on Prishtina for its tariffs on Serbia has been “decidedly unbalanced,” Engel said.

The U.S., he added, should work with European allies “to treat both countries as independent and sovereign partners, applying consistent standards to both sides as we try to restart peace talks.”

The arms purchases from Russia require U.S. sanctions on Serbia under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, passed in the aftermath of 2016 Russian interference in U.S. elections, Engel said.

“Neither have we imposed those sanctions, nor have we energetically pressed Serbia to end its derecognition efforts,” Engel said.

“When U.S. law says we should sanction Serbia due to its security ties with Russia, we should.”  ",,/r/europe/comments/fqeqjy/congressman_eliot_engel_raises_concerns_over/flq2806/,CrystalMaterelius,1585376306

397,"First of all, I am from a ""southern country"" and working in a ""northern country"" so then I consider myself to be inferior. Since I experienced life on both sides, I know why Austria and Germany are rich and Croatia or Romania are poor. Germany earned their money and every country in the EU is trying to take advantage of other countries. Not explicit, but they do. For example, people in Croatia honestly expect EU to bring prosperity without them doing any work. Everybody tries to take advantage of everybody.

If you look at it from a micro-prospective, as a person working in Croatia you have a choice: either you work in Croatia and you earn more in comparsion with others, but taxes you pay are basically thrown into the river (and many other expenses exist only on a paper) or you go to developed country, get paid comparatively less because of many different expenses, but you get good health insurance, education for children, etc. Nothing stops a German to go and work in such system, but they don't want that. Croatia also imports cheap labor from Bosnia, everybody in EU does.

Another thing is, one might say that the fact that I expect from Spain not to rely on EU means I have respect for them and see potential in them. Everyone in EU should be able to handle most of their issues. When Austria was under a 90% lockdown, people were moving freely in Spain, beaches were full in Portugal, etc. 
When it's all said and done, somebody in Spain and Italy should be held accountable for everything that happened in their countries. But that's a problem for another day.

I don't think anyone should be left alone. Germany is helping France, Austria sent medical equipment to Italy and there are all kinds of information exchange going on. I'm fine with helping with logistics, staff, etc. I'm only saying, there is a difference between helping with acute issues and with paying other people's bills.

460,"Google translation (No time to do it manually at the moment, sorry):

"" They had been hanging around for too many hours without an agreement. So Charles Michel, President of the European Council, took a break with his team to find a meeting point in the middle of last Thursday's European summit to deal with the coronavirus crisis. When Michel returned, he thought he had it. Italian Giuseppe Conte, allied with Pedro Sánchez - a scene that reminded the June 2012 summit, in full debate on austerity, when Mario Monti and Mariano Rajoy stood before Angela Merkel - had already threatened several times to block the summit before the resistance of the Dutch Mark Rutte and the German chancellor. She is the only one who is still there, eight years later, again facing an alliance of Italy and Spain, this time backed by seven countries, France included. The reconstruction that EL PAÍS has made with sources from various delegations shows the intensity of the discussion. 

 Michel saw Sánchez with doubts. 

 ""Do we have an agreement, Pedro?""

  ""No, Charles. So it is unacceptable. I cannot accept vague language and speak for several weeks when my country has the health emergency it has. We have asked for common unemployment insurance and you are not giving it to me. The mandate to the Eurogroup has to be clear. ""

 Sánchez stood up and threatened not to sign the statement. The discussion, which had been going on for hours, was further complicated. Dutchman Rutte, the toughest, had already had an intense crossover with Conte, who rejected any reference to the European rescue mechanism in the final resolution. For Italy, with the most delicate economic situation, that would suppose the stigma of a bailout with conditions, like that of Greece in 2010. Something unacceptable due to a crisis of which no one is guilty and affects everyone equally, insisted Conte supported by Sánchez and others. 

""If Italy removes the mention of the Mede \[the rescue mechanism\] we will remove all the rest of the paragraph,"" Rutte fanned himself. Merkel came out in her support advised the Italian not to despise the Mede.""

""It is a very good instrument."" In the end he is the one who sees you help. Don't be so critical. If what you are waiting for are the coronabonos, they will never come. My Parliament would not accept it. You are generating expectations that are not going to be fulfilled and sending messages of division, ”protested Merkel, annoyed by the letter from nine countries asking for the coronabonuses.""

In the end, Sánchez and Merkel also openly discussed:

""This is clearly insufficient."" I can't go to my citizens with this right now. I need a clear language - Sánchez insisted.

&amp;#x200B;

""Pedro, you're wrong. You say the paragraph is nothing, but there are people working, you have to leave them, "" suggested the chancellor, who intended to leave the matter to the Eurogroup, which brings together the finance ministers.

""Angela, I'm listening, but it's clearly insufficient."" We have already been here. If we do not give them a clear mandate, we already know what will happen. Do you not understand the emergency we are experiencing?

""Pedro, how can you say I don't understand her?"" The German annoyed.

""I need you to understand the urgency of the moment.""

""Pedro, we are already at the limit. We have already made many commitments.""

"" I have also made many commitments in a very difficult situation.""

""Pedro is right,"" said the Frenchman Emmanuel Macron. ""I am with him that we cannot transfer our political responsibility to the Eurogroup. This is a political issue, we cannot leave it in the hands of the finance ministers, who reproduce each other's positions,""

Macron, however, had much less prominence than other times, according to sources from various delegations. “It was like a soccer game. After the interventions of some prime ministers, we jumped as if they had scored a goal ”, enthuses one of the participating delegations. The rules of distancing required that the appointment be held by videoconference, which augured a brief meeting to give the go-ahead to a joint statement full of intentions as good as vague. But the rebellion of Spain and Italy changed the scene. And the consulted participants describe the six hours of telephone as one of the most exciting summits of recent times, full of fine fencing and with some dialectical stabbing rag, with Merkel, Sánchez, Conte and Rutte as the main protagonists of a duel to four which ended in a draw and left the outcome for the second leg, within two weeks.

The appointment started at 4 pm with the intervention of Michel, who tried to highlight the measures that have been adopted since the beginning of the crisis, such as the purchase of material or the investment of 170 million euros in research into the possible vaccine. . The turn passed to the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who, after her initial intervention, remained silent. She was the great absentee of the appointment along with the discreet leading role of Macron.

The presidents of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, and of the Eurogroup, the Portuguese minister Mário Centeno, were in charge of describing the dramatic economic scenario that lies ahead. ""We are facing a recession that can range between 2% and 10% of GDP decline,"" Lagarde warned, according to sources in the audience. The French recalled that the fiscal spending approved so far is equivalent to two points of GDP. But he believes it may be necessary to double it to 4%, a huge multiplication of resources that not all countries can afford with their own means. Rye, according to sources, also added to the description of a rather apocalyptic panorama.

The first round of intervention from the respective capitals did not anticipate surprises, given that the position of each government was known, with the side of fiscal orthodoxy led by Germany and the Netherlands, and the group in favor of a European fiscal response grouped around "" the letter of 9 "", signed the day before by France, Italy and Spain, among others.

""Merkel started, who came from her house, without video, only with a photo of her on the screen, very young indeed, and, curiously, with the voice of an interpreter, not hers,"" says one of those present. The round continued smoothly. Michel could trust a quiet summit of just over two hours.

The surprise came with the connection with Rome and Madrid. Sánchez and Conte ""despised the draft declaration and both said that this text was not worth anything,"" says a diplomatic source.

The summit had just exploded. Michel tried to redirect the situation, drawing on his known ability for commitment and a sense of humor.

""I think we have a little problem with paragraph 14,"" the president said ironically, referring to the part of the conclusions that the storm had unleashed. The screens burst into laughter at Michel's joke. The first and last before addressing the ""little problem"" for several hours.

Sánchez and Merkel also clashed on account of the Spanish proposal for the presidents of the five European institutions (Commission, Council, Parliament, ECB and Eurogroup) to prepare a report on possible financing formulas for a European response to the coronavirus crisis.

""Nein \[No\], was heard from the Berlin screen, already with Merkel's voice but without her live image.

""Angela, how is it possible that you don't trust a report prepared by our institutions?"" Sanchez snapped.

""Because he will propose things that I cannot assume,"" Merkel replied, convinced that the five presidents (including a French, an Italian, a Portuguese and a Belgian) would end up proposing some type of debt mutualization (Coronabonos or Eurobonds) unacceptable for Berlin Result: Speaker of Parliament David Sassoli and Centeno were dropped from the list. And Merkel demanded to keep the German Von der Leyen. In exchange, Sánchez managed to incorporate the name of the French Lagarde.

""There was a time when we thought it was impossible to reach an agreement,"" sources close to Michel admit. In reality there was no pact, but rather a plant from Spain and Italy, which has made more evident the hard positions of the same that in 2012 were betting on austerity and now continue to reject the Coronabonds almost as if their life was in it. . ""Don't create false expectations,"" insisted Merkel. The ""nein"" is still there.

553,"Crucial medical supplies for Covid-19 patients in Ireland have been held back by a major supplier, citing restrictions on exports imposed by Italian authorities.

This is despite a European Union deal to drop export bans on medical equipment within Europe earlier this month.

The shipment is the first consignment in an order of 1,000 specially designed hoods, manufactured in Italy, which administer high-pressure oxygen to patients in a manner that reduces the risk of healthcare workers being exposed to the virus.

A spokesman for the importing company, Orega Systems, said it had ordered the units from its Italian partner at the start of the month, but they had not arrived. The equipment is destined for hospitals around the country.

A letter sent to Orega Systems by the Italian manufacturer, seen by The Irish Times, states: “We regret to inform you that the Italian government has imposed restrictions on the export of ventilators, hoods, full face masks and other devices used for providing respiratory therapies.”

“As these devices are considered essential products for treating those ill with the coronavirus, in this extraordinary emergency situation, manufacturers are obliged to supply the Italian hospitals and the Civil Protection Authority first.”
Non-invasive ventilation
The exporting company cited a law introduced on February 28th during the Covid-19 outbreak by Italy, which states companies must give priority to orders by Italian civil authorities for medical equipment, and makes exports of key goods subject to approval.

Dr Oisín O’Connell, a respiratory consultant in Bons Secours Hospital in Cork, said the hoods would enable non-invasive ventilation of patients with Covid-19. The machines detect difficulties in patients’ breathing and inject high-pressure oxygen into the hood. “For every breath, it gives you extra support. If you’re wrecked by this virus and you can barely take a breath, it will sense that and pump more in,” Dr O’Connell said. It has the added benefit of limiting the spread of virus breathed out.

The machines are high-end units available only to hospitals, not for retail use.

They are more flexible than ventilators, and can be deployed in a variety of hospital settings, meaning the treatment can be delivered in any room or corridor. They are significantly cheaper than ventilators, costing €2,500-€5,000 compared with up to €40,000, Dr O’Connell said.

Italy passed laws last month stating that protective equipment, ventilators and ventilator parts can only be exported if authorised by Italian Civil Protection. Other EU states such as Germany later imposed restrictions also.

Freedom of goods
The European Commission appealed for countries to drop such bans, saying they were contrary to freedom of goods in the single market. On March 15th the commission imposed an EU-wide ban on exports of crucial medical goods to countries outside the EU and European Economic Area, in an attempt to persuade EU states to continue supplying to each other.

But the blocking of supplies to Irish hospitals indicates this has failed to work.

“Obviously the export of medical goods made in Italy, that the nation needs, evidently creates a conflict,” a spokesman for Italy’s Civil Protection said.

A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said it was “aware of this case and is working to extend all possible assistance in resolving this issue”.

619,"But new cases is exactly that.

For example if 5,000 people tested positive on one day but 1,000 died and 4,500 recovered that would result in -500 new active cases.

To show the spread of the infection you would report 5,000 new cases because the virus has spread to 5,000 new people. You wouldn't report -500 new cases because that would indicate that the virus is no longer spreading.

There could be (but isn't at the moment) a trend of increasing new cases but also an increasing number of deaths and recoveries. Reporting new cases would accurately represent this while reporting new active cases might instead incorrectly portray the outbreak as stagnating/not growing.

For example:

**Day 1**    
New Actual Cases: 1000    
New Recoveries: 100    
New Deaths: 100    
New Active Cases: 800

**Day 2**    
New Actual Cases: 1500    
New Recoveries: 500    
New Deaths: 200    
New Active Cases: 800    

**Day 3**    
New Actual Cases: 2000    
New Recoveries: 700    
New Deaths: 600    
New Active Cases: 700    

**Day 4**    
New Actual Cases: 2500    
New Recoveries: 1000    
New Deaths: 700    
New Active Cases: 700    


**Day 5**    
New Actual Cases: 3000    
New Recoveries: 1500    
New Deaths: 1000    
New Active Cases: 500    


Using active cases makes it look like the outbreak is slowing (800 to 800 to 700 to 700 to 500) when it is actually accelerating (1000 to 1500 to 2000 to 2500 to 3000).",,/r/europe/comments/fq0aml/italy_coronavirus_919_deaths_in_a_day_never_so/flp4ow1/,TheProgrammingDog,1585351608

Bigger countries and peripheral countries profit less, but they still profit. So no country (according to the European Commission, they should know) is worse off, so why would you need compensation. And as far as you need compensation, Portugal and Greece are large net receivers of EU funds. Italy is a special case, they use the EU to funnel money to the south of Italy which they apparently can't do domestically for political reasons. Well, that is sad but not a reason to get into a fiscal union. And other countries that are peripheral seem pretty content with where they are in the EU without asking for money. Like Finland. 

Also note that eurobonds are a two-edged sword. Yes, the south would borrow more cheaply. But it would come with massive strings attached in terms of controls on spending. You cannot expect Germany assuming risks over payment of Portuguese or Italian debt if Italy and Portugal can still decide autonomously on what their retirement age is, how high their government pensions are and how high or low the tax rates are.

942,"&gt; The EU should define a baseline taxation level that any entity that does business in the union must pay.

This wouldn't work. Fiscal incentives are a tool for some countries to become attractive. Ireland, for instance, is now a country that starts relying less on tax advantages, but had they not had it in the first place, they would still be a secluded backwater.

Likewise, comparing the Netherlands, Europe's main cargo port area to Portugal is ridiculous. Even if Portugal was able to somehow develop competitive infrastructure, they would still be thousands of kilometers from the heart of industrial Europe, and that infrastructure would be left to decay.

Fiscality is currently the only tool some countries have to attract business, as currency and borders have been removed. It has a major problem, which is that it doesn't really work for large countries.

The real solution would be either to work for a proper redistribution mechanism, or to enforce current acount imbalance penalties strictly. Sadly, this won't happen because the country currently benefiting from it won't ever agree.

I think we should maybe shout louder about what is going on in terms of emergency legislation to tackle this crisis - in Hungary, for example, the draconian measures being considered by MPs this week have no time limit, meaning they could be used when the coronavirus crisis is over. I’m not sure we could have done anything earlier. It’s happened so fast. We carried an interview with the WHO director-general in October last year warning the world was not ready for a pandemic. And we reported earlier on what was going on in China. What do you think the media should have done differently?

**Marta:** I think media in general have done great job in covering this. Unfortunately newsrooms (here in Italy for example) have been affected by the virus too, forcing people to work from home and reducing the news flow. Personally I can say I have been covering coronavirus as a correspondant for euronews in the very beginning when Italy was the first European country hit by the virus. I was on the field. The sensation I had was that other countries didn't get how serious this was at the beginning and so they started too late to establish rules for the lockdown.",,/r/europe/comments/fpxeqj/hello_reddit_we_are_three_journalists_working_for/flnoyro/,euronews-english,1585323084

As I rule I do not downvote people I am in discussion with. I consider it poor taste. If I disagree with you, I'll tell you. Don't worry.

Furthermore this is the first time I see your post, as I stepped outside for a walk about 5 minutes before you posted it and only just came back. So thank you for your baseless accusations. May I assume you will withdraw them?

&gt;Your government IS morally bankrupt when your financial minister makes declarations like that knowing very well their finances would be very different if not for taxation, drugs and prostitution.

How much, in hard numbers, does 'taxation, drugs and prostitution' contribute to our government finances, and, in hard numbers, how much do these things cost our treasury. I think you'll find it is far less than you might think.

In the past years we have made deep cuts in government expenditure and that provided us with a surplus (do not for one second think you were the only countries suffering from austerity), but we did not whine and instead used it to build stronger foundations. Don't blame us for building your golden palace on shaky ground. 

Tell me; how much money has been squanderd on the AVE network?

&gt;That's just fucking evil in a moment when people is fucking dying. 

This is called moral and emotional blackmail: ""Hand over the keys to your castle or you're responsible for these people's suffering."" It has obviously been missed in translation but Hoekstra is questioning the need for this mechanism and the long term implications of using it and wants to see this investigated before doing anything. Since when in prudence a bad thing?

People are dying, yes. But they will die with or without this money regardless.

&gt;Measures that weren't vote, that were forced upon us by an economic bloc despite our sovereign rights. So don't talk about civil liberties. 

What civil liberties were taken away during austerity, exactly?

1222,"&gt;I'm curious what it is exactly that China has donated to Serbia? I can find many articles talking about it and Vucic lavishing China with praise but I haven't seen mentions of what exactly the Chinese provided.

Because the western media doesn't report on it. In Serbian media there is information on what China has donated, and he said it himself in a press conference, the exact numbers. That was like two weeks ago so forgive if I don't remember the exact numbers. But it was the usual things, masks (I think around 5 million), respirators, ventilators, tests, mobile ventilators, and 5-6 experts too, protective equipment.

&gt;So I can't tell if it's less or more but the EU and Norway have provided Serbia with over 100 million euros to fight the pandemic.

We needed medical equipment not money.

&gt;The EU has made Serbia a partner in its new medical equipment stockpile which it can use as if it were an EU member.

Which doesn't exist yet, and DID NOT EXIST at the time Vucic gave that speech. 

&gt;Over the years the EU has provided nearly half a billion euros of grants and loans to Serbia's medical sector, 250 medical vehicles and 122 ventilators. That's not nothing. But Vucic insults the EU while talking of Chinese brothers and an iron friendship between them. 

That's nice and all for before, but when there was a crisis France and Germany de facto banned export of medical equipment. We went where it wasn't banned and got it for free. 

The article very much likes to pretend and ignore the aforementioned fact that at the time of this speech there was a de facto export ban on medical equipment from European countries. France and Germany like to pretend and autistically screech how ""it only required approval, it was not a ban"" but they ignore the fact they didn't give approval to anyone. Donating equipment is a a relatively new thing in the EU, and Serbia certainly shouldn't have waited to see if there would be such a development and ignore others.",The Enclave,/r/europe/comments/fpt82c/serbias_coronavirus_diplomacy_unmasked_the/fln42z8/,PATKO_,1585308403

1252,"&gt;''moderate'' Russophobia - what do you define it as?

Most people here are somewhat against Russia or making political concessions for local Russians.

It is entirely rational, but objectively still Russophobia.

&gt;Staunch liberals and pro-LGBT people in Latvia are deeply integrated into inclusive circles where ethnicity does not matter.

First of all I have no idea whether such pro-LGBT Russians exist because they generally are anti-LGBT and Estonians and Russians generally don't form common social circles.

&gt;as Russian people are just as varied as Latvians or Estonians

Now that I highly doubt, especially in a case of such a politically problematic minority population here.

&gt;sometimes hold completely similar views just wrapped up in a different nationalistic ribbon.

With the difference of one being entirely rational and the other imperialistic.

&gt;Something being or not being mainstream doesn't nullify it. Antisemitism being mainstream fin the 30ies and 40ies didn't nullify antisemitism. It's still just as illogical and fucked up as it is nowadays.

Antisemitism was not rational, moderate Russophobia in our case certainly is. Again, in the end we might think exactly the same - I just call it differently.

&gt;Then why change ''Russophobe'' to ''Russophone''?

Because I consider most of us to be at least moderately Russophobic and therefore this anti-LGBT label doesn't really suit all Russophobic people.",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/fp3w7l/75_of_russians_say_soviet_era_was_greatest_time/fln45uw/,k6lvatu,1585308481

&gt;Most German (and many others) voters would love to see Italy leave the Eurozone.

No, it would weaken the Eurozone to see the 8th/12th (depending on nominal or PPP GDP) largest economy of the world leave it.

Imagine the situation; if Germany had increased the spending after the 90s, increased it again in the 2000s; and again in '08 and would now have to increase it again for the corona crisis.

Why they have this strong conviction so broadly in their society I do not really understand. They see the idea of government borrowing money that it doesn't have an consequent inflation as abhorrent. This has significantly impacted the European policy.

The question is this. Were Southern European nations really that much worse off when they had their own currencies and could borrow against their future selves, driving down their currency value to keep themselves ticking along? Back then, they didn't need to go cap in hand to Germany and the EU to borrow money if something went wrong.

Obviously each situation has both pros and cons. When they had their own currencies, those currencies were worth far less than others globally. The cost of imports and travel was higher. On the other hand, unemployment was lower, the young weren't flocking abroad for work and education to the same degree, more young people could afford to leave the family home, and generally I feel their societies ran more naturally because essentials were much cheaper and although people earned less, they needed less.

This is not ""victim playing"" though, there is a bad reality that you miss. 
Lets see it.. while Italy is in its worst hour unacceptable things happen some examples : 
-much needed medical supply coming from to Italy are blocked for 2 fucking weeks in Germany and Czechia. Meanwhile people are dying by the 100s in Italy.
-Russia sends 10 cargo airplane with medical supply to Italy. These planes have can't travel the usual way cause certain EU countries won't allow them to cross their airspace. They have to make a huge detour going over Turkey and Greece to get to Italy to deliver the much needed medical supplies.  While people in Italy are dying by  the 100s. 

Is this the same morality the north uses when talking about the lazy south? Or is it something much worse costing human lives and not money? How would YOU feel about it? Get in their shoes and THINK. 
Yes the EU did a huge favour to the Chinese and Putin acting so....

Let me give you another example. My country Greece has borders with Turkey. A country hostile to all its neighbours and the whole EU. 
We have to spend the precious little money we have to support an army much bigger in comparison to many of those in the northern countries. 
During the economic crisis the north were telling us ""why do you need such an army""? 
Erdogan made the answer quite clear for everyone to see. We stopped and still stopping thousands of immigrants on our borders. The EU said it will back us, All fine. 
But how certain members act? Lets say Germany. Next day they send some million euros to Erdogan. They still den business with him selling him the very weapons he uses against them. The fucking armoured vehicles they used to bring down our border fences were payed with EU money. 
Some countries -and we are Grateful- send help. Personel and equipment . Austria, Estonia, Poland etc. We are ThankFul. They are our brothers. 

But where is the help from Germany? Holland etc? It their help shitty moralistic sayings ""you shouldn't spend""? 

why should we take the effort? It would be way cheaper and less dangerous to put all those immigrants on trains and send them to Munich. Thats where they want to go anyway. They dont want to stay in the shitty south....

1562,"Nice absurd take on the integrity of my argument.

I'm asserting, as anyone would if they were in anyway aware and honest in their understanding of geopolitics, that China, specifically, has falsified their statistics. 

China was the origin of the outbreak. Their number one priority upon realizing that there was a crisis on their hands was not to contain the outbreak, but to contain INFORMATION about it. They arrested journalists and even their own doctors who had a conscience who were reporting on the severity of the issue and the particulars of how badly the Chinese government was handling it, both in terms of competence and in terms of the brutality they engaged in. When foreign countries, like the US, started making statements about the crisis, China denied it. First they said there was no outbreak, even though we knew they were aware of its severity for a long time. Then they said it wasn't communicable human-to-human, even though they knew that wasn't the case. They said the outrbreak was contained, that all people exposed were accounted for. That was a lie. People were traveling from Wuhan nearly every country in the world by then. When the US, basically the first country to enact travel restrictions in response to the outbreak, shut off travel from China, China called the US xenophobic and racist and people like yourself bought into it. China also then accused the US military of planting the virus in China. I'm sure you liked that one too.

China has been dishonest from the beginning, and their propaganda is very effective, which you can see clearly by looking at the absolute hysterical anti-American, pro-China circle-jerks that have dominated reddit for weeks now.

China is an authoritarian, undemocratic country that is extremely repressive towards dissent, and who depends utterly on controlling information to keep their people compliant and to uphold their international image.

There is no evidence, whatsoever, that the US has falsified health statistics. This is not something the US does, ever. The US is a very open country and its health care system is not centralized, meaning an authoritarian federal government (TRUMP BAD) would never be able to fuzz the numbers even if they tried. So don't try to draw a false equivalency.

Anyway, what you're doing is resorting to mental gymnastics to avoid acknowledging a fact that you don't like immediately, because it doesn't satisfy your bias, and also because the reaction people with your ideology to this crisis has showed the underlying insanity to their world view. Basically the constant, psychotic focus on bashing the US to the point that Europeans, who are doing objectively worse than the US in containing and responding to the COVID-19 virus, reserve all of their criticism for the US and not their own governments and systems.

Anti-Americanism is fundamentally idiotic, dishonest, hypocritical and delusional. The fact that Europeans are single-mindedly circle-jerking about how bad the US is at dealing with the pandemic is proof of that.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/fpklw6/macrons_popularity_jumps_as_french_approve_of/flmnct0/,MySoulIsaModem,1585289156

Not a single bit of what is happening in the US is actually reported on accurately in Europe. Every single story you're hearing about this is biased and designed specifically to exploit the crisis to reinforce preexisting narratives.

You have no clue what the US is actually doing, and how well it is doing it. If the US handled this crisis better than anyone else in a completely undeniable way (and I'm not saying that is the case) you would still instinctively use the US as a scapegoat and a distraction from your problems.

I agree that there is a line between maliciousness and humour, and some people here cross the line (I don't think that's correct in this case, but that is subjective). 

As for the European project, I don't think /r/Europe has a lot of effect on it. There is a lot of cooperation happening, especially on the mainland. Just today there were news about the French military having talks with their German counterparts about transporting the sick. This would have been unthinkable a few decades ago. A few weeks ago Austrian soldiers on the Greek border used the sentence ""We are protecting our borders"" when speaking with their Turkish counterparts. Europe is uniting, slowly but surely, and it's sad that your country opted out.

In fact the biggest shock to the project itself does not come from the mainland, it came from the UK with Brexit. Brexit was arguably the result of years of misinformation from both the UK press, and their politicians.

No, you say that the response here was ""shameful"" and who the hell knows what that means.

You said it was better in Germany than in the USA; that's debatable, I've never heard of people flocking to Germany to get medical care.  They come here.

&gt;And most ironically, according the document you linked to, the rate of deaths per 1M total population is lower in Germany that in the US! And we have a much smaller population too, and we had earlier infections! 

Yes, the rate of people dying here is 3 and in Germany is 4... that's not exactly an out of this world difference; but often I read in this sub about how good are the socialized and ""free"" healthcare system in Europe, but the data doesn't back that up.  By the way, when we're discussing proportions the size of the population doesn't matter... so I don't know why you think that's important in this context.

The EU does not enforce how much meat you eat. They might fund research or implement policies in trying to limit meat consumption. Nobody is being stopped from buying or eating meat. They might choose to use less funds to subsidize farmers active in meat production I guess?

The EU does not decide what you drive. They do set environmental rules and other standards to force car companies to make less polluting cars. Also stricter safety guidelines, the noise they can make, etc etc.

The EU does not decide how to heat your house. They might make policies together with nation states to set standards for how new buildings are built, so they are according to standards to keep heat in to reach environmental goals.

Why is ethnicity what we use to determine who is and isn't in our group for self determination purposes?

Further more, what makes you identify as Estonian rather than the broader Soviet? Both are equally valid descriptions for your ethnicity, so why do you view yourself as Estonian but not Soviet?

The articles responsible for this are protected by an eternity clause. They cannot be changed. The article is § 79 (3):

 [https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch\_gg/englisch\_gg.html#p0414](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0414) 

&gt; Amendments to this Basic Law affecting the division of the Federation into *Länder*, their participation in principle in the legislative process, or the principles laid down in Articles 1 and 20 shall be inadmissible. 

So, article 20 defines the structure of Germany:

 [https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch\_gg/englisch\_gg.html#p0111](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0111) 

&gt; All state authority is derived from the people. It shall be exercised by the people through elections and other votes and through specific legislative, executive and judicial bodies. 

If the country would give away it's budgetary responsibility (see what i quoted previously) the authority of the people would have vanished.

We can only replace the entire basic law via a referendum that the Germany people vote on. (And even this is disputed by some, but afaik most opinions i've read is that the German people can vote in a new basic law without the articles in question)

This eternity clause is a direct response to WW2 so it could never happen again. So now you might see how we Germans might be very hesitant to make changes to such an important part.

The largest chance i see for this to happen, were to enable the EU to become a federation. Making these changes just to enable Eurobonds? Very unlikely in our lifetimes.

And i admit this is an easy cop-out for us. But well, i'm not willing to throw our basic law out just because it's somehow inconvenient. Just like i don't throw it out just because currently many migrants take advantage of our protections of human dignity and we thus have problems with deporting denied refugees.

The difference was that in that instance Germany benefited from having their interest rates further decreased.

Sounds to me like German politicians interpret your fundamental law according to the outcome they want to achieve.

Also, i assume Germany's constitution is like most countries where you need a supermajority to change it. I would say that if 75% of the Bundestag decided to wave this constitutional rule for a one-time measure where they'd authorize a fixed X amount of mutualized debt to be issued in order to tackle an unexpected, never seen before and tragic event, the German people would truly be looked upon with a sense of fellowship and responsibility in a time of exceptional need, strengthening both the Union and their position in it.

And all it would cost them would be having their sovereign debt pay an almost symbolic interest rate, instead of actually earning money from borrowing money. 

Whole Empires have wanted to lead Europe, some sent their sons to die for it, others sank entire treasuries trying to achieve it. Today Germany has the chance to be the lightest of leaders, with the best of optics, for the smallest cost. And a lot to gain. But as the past decade has shown, Germany really does not want to.

Germany's position is that we have a finance mechanism for times of crisis, and it is called the ESM.

Then we were trying to prop up the financial industry so that the crisis would not spread to the economy, and it took months to unravel. This crisis directly hit the entire world's economy all at once and for at least half a year.

Like I said, *all* countries are going to have to deficit spend like crazy, and the the only purchaser for all that debt can be central banks. Don't think Germany is isolated. Germany will have doubled its government debt before this is over.

So the only question is whether it's going to be EU members selling their own bonds and the ECB buying them. Those countries selling Eurobonds and the ECB buying them. Or those countries selling their own bonds and their own central banks buying them (i.e., the Eurozone and the EU collapsing).

If Germany blocks Eurobonds, there is a very good chance that the EU in its current form and the single market is finished. If the ECB is not allowed to buy unlimited government debt, it is 100% certain the Eurozone is finished.

&gt; 
&gt; 

As an Asian (not China) who lived in Europe for a while, you hit the nail on the head. You see, in Asia, we have had this notion that Europeans have an open world-view, they worked hard to build society, and are smart-working folks who also don't just chase $$$ like Americans etc. 

And then I came to Europe and got my own taste of ""Paris syndrome"". The amount of utter laziness despite living in the world's most advanced region, taking things for granted mentality especially among the youth (15-30 year olds) for topics ranging from career to global awareness was mind-boggling. 

A good example is technology where *every* European country I lived, worked, or visited in lagged way behind in internet speed or mobile 4g coverage compared to several Asian countries that - until 15 years ago - had less than 1% population with mobile phones, to give you an idea. 

Another good example of this is discussion around migrants (which obscures the boundary between high-skilled immigrants, political asylum seekers, and refugees). For heaven's sake, I arguments so incredibly naive and short-sighted - of course, it doesn't help that many critics of refugee crisis for instance are right-wingers but well...Point is: first put oxygen mask on yourself and then try to help others. Your ""help"", in fact, may be very short-sighted and you could be counting trees for forest.

I was aghast to find that there were countries that were utterly conservative for various medical topics where a non-religious (read: non-Islamic) Asian country wouldn't fret: abortion remains a controversial topic in 2020 for heaven's sake in Europe! I had had various arguments with people about effectiveness of homeopathy in a country like Germany that is well regarded as a front-runner in terms of medical and technological advancement. An undercurrent of racism was felt when I noticed various people there thinking ""ah, we won't have any issue in our rich countries, only poor countries in Asia and Africa have such diseases or poor infrastructure, check Wikipedia lol""

Suffice to say that the disappointment was not held by myself alone, and was/is shared by a significant number of colleagues I spoke with or communities I interacted with. Mind you, this is not even a ""Grass is greener"" and harsh realization that came up with it. Its about how a region, that was perceived as a frontrunner of the world in various social and technological topic, comes to be failing. Gap between Asia and Europe is closing fast.

Anyhow, that went a little off the point but still...Europe is an amazing region but I continued to felt that an entire generation takes ""living fine"" a bit too much for granted.

China also has a debt to GDP ratio most likely of 80-85%, given the portion that is off the books. 

I’m also fairly positive most of both countries debt is owned either by the country, or public or private organizations either in the EU or of allied nations.

2151,"I generally agree with your comment, just a few small things:

&gt; they might be just an ideology followers

and isn't this basically their canon?

&gt; Then, religions are pretty official (and mentioned in a law somewhere, I'm sure) whereas cults and fandoms are not
&gt; Still, cults are perceived rather badly

This is derived from their numbers. Religions and cult are in competition on the same ""market"". Each will use dirty tricks to get members from the other, its the only way it can survive in the long run. Any religion/ideology that is not aggressive (to some extent) will get eaten. So of course they bash their competitors if they can. And is easy to say bad stuff about a small religion (cult) that has few members , few people even know someone from that cult. But if the cult grows, it gains power in society and it gets to be known better, almost anyone knows someone from that cult (that just became a religion) and they see they are also just regular people, like everyone else, they don't bite. And because they have more power now (power that comes from number of members) they get to sit at the table with big boys, they are also legal now (you can't make illegal bug percents of population without risking civil war).  

Also one more important aspect, a big difference between religion and groups you gave as example. Religion is an important thing in many people's life. Most members of a religion would consider this membership important in their daily life. Sport, fictional universes... except for a few very dedicated nutjobs for the most people is just a hobby, so even when we're talking about such big groups for most members it doesn't mean that much. That's why such groups don't become powerful, don't have a political agenda, because even when big, for most members it means very little. People can like multiple TV-shows, sports, books simultaneously. Religion/cults requires exclusivity and more dedication. Thats why churches in Europe, even while they still have big % of the population as members, lost a lot from their former power. Because on average, each member cares less about religion today than a few decades/centuries ago.

Italy proceeds to vote alt right on a promise for a referendum to leave the ""traitorous"" EU and/or the eurozone (which they wouldn't be entirely wrong about, given that Italy is the country with the highest downside from the single currency).

When the referendum passes, banks capsize as their Italian debt becomes toxic, and two years of uncertainy follows about what happens to the euro. There will be an ELI5 thread on reddit asking ""why exactly does Ixit result in a return to national monetary policy?"". Anyway, anyone who didn't convert their euros to dollars in time gets rekt.

Say your NPP would supply 100 units of energy per year at a price of 10 cents (which is a fair number for new NPPs). Now you reduce it down to 70 units per year. You now must charge 14 cents per unit of energy.

Or the other way, if you produce 50 units of energy for 10 cents but that is at 50% load and you could go up to 100 to meet the winter heating demand.  So those 50 units of energy in summer cost you effectively 0.  Why not take it and produce hydrogen with it?

Sure you lose half the energy you put in, but well, if you can later sell those 25 units of energy during peak demand for 10 cents (or even more, peak demand after all) that's a profit to be made.

It never makes any sense to throttle the output of NPPs down. The only reason why you ever want to do it is if the grid can't handle it. Same with wind and solar.

* I don't think Estonians are too negatively minded on the 1980 Olympics. Because of that, a large part of the medieval old town of Tallinn was refurbished (it was a rather poor area full of dilapidation before) and many iconic buildings and pieces of infrastructure were built in the city.
* Estonia didn't adopt the euro in 2004, but in 2011, just after the massive economic crisis. The government adopted a firm stance on budget discipline and rather went for austerity than borrowing, in order to meet the adoption criteria. It was painful as the economy plunged 14% in a single year, but nevertheless it recovered in the following years. Probably easier to do that for a small export-oriented economy than for a large country with massive internal market, though.
* Estonia has seen surge in support for alt-right politics as well. In fact, an alt-right party is currently part of the government coalition. And no, it isn't too different from every other alt-right party – they're loud, anti-minority, praise Trump, Orban and the like, blame the media and anything ""mainstream"", their electorate fetishizes strongman leadership etc. Their values pretty much contradict the EU, but they can't afford to be too openly anti-EU as Estonians have higher-than-average support for the union.",Eesti,/r/europe/comments/fpd15d/in_praise_of_a_normal_boring_country_a_trip_to/flka3pv/,toreon,1585236989

I think that one issue that people struggle to understand, is that Soviet Union ultimately collapsed because its system was unsustainable.

But that is fundamentally flawed if you accept that the Soviet system was doomed to fail (perhaps it could've been reformed similar to China, but the way Soviet eoconmy was set up, was unsustainable). Most industries that closed, weren't closed because of the collapse, but because they had become so incredibly uncompetitive with the rest of the world, that they simply couldn't continue, they were wealth destroying enterprises. Although I'm sure that within that general collapse, there was some collateral damage - some inherently decent companies, that simply got caught in the wind. But in general, the closing of soviet industries was inevitable.

I think that if the Soviet economy had collapsed before the break-up of the union, then people would feel much less nostalgia for the union.",,/r/europe/comments/fp3w7l/75_of_russians_say_soviet_era_was_greatest_time/fljxg42/,sanderudam,1585229164

What the hell? It just seems to me that everything that ""Kim Torra"" says goes directly into that ""bag"" just because he is ""Kim Torra"".

The fact is that Spain is the worst country in Europe dealing with this disease, and it for some reason it looks like it's not trying to stop this. Italy has already went into full lock-down (meaning that unless it's an essential service, you're not allowed to go out your home to work), and that's all what ""Kim Torra"" is asking for.

2379,"&gt; This is just too dismissive though. You have an opinion on what the Soviet system was like for Russians and you're outright dismissing the Russians' own opinions of it. ""I know what's best for you"" is a really patronizing attitude.

Let me word it this way... I disagree with their opinion. Am I dismissive because I disagree with them and have my own opinion? Their opinions matters to me as much as my opinion matters to them, not much. You're the one using their opinion as some sort of appeal to authority. As if the great collective wisdom of the old Russians somehow have an objective and clear view of a system they were born into, which indoctrinated them from birth that it is the best and only system, and brutally punished any dissident opinions. Which failed so utterly that once it was gone it left the country in an almost complete state of anarchy. Why should I take their opinion as anything more than opinions of indoctrinated victims of a the said system? I'm sure some of them had a privileged position back in the old system so of course things were better for them.

The old system created a whole generation of people who have no idea and no touch with how a real economy works. Jobs were created for the sake of having a job and to buy social peace. Because having a huge population of unemployed people isn't good for social stability. These are people who worked in one factory, or once place of employment most of their lives and never had to worry about the fact that their factories (or whatever) weren't in any way shape or form self sufficient. None of that mattered because people had jobs. So try explaining to the old Russian that his whole 30+ year carrier was spent working for a factory that would have never survived had it been left to its own devices. People never thought about that because it was discouraged and they were never taught those things. 60 years later they are lamenting about how ""at least we had jobs back in my day"". Yeah, you had jobs... I too can create jobs for people, I'll just have them count pebbles on the beach all day and pretend it somehow pays for itself.

""I know what's best for you"" are your words, not mine. I said the Russians can think whatever they want and I said I **believe** I'm speaking for most Eastern Europans and non USSR part of Russians when I say ""No, thanks"".

But on the flip side, why do you think old Russians somehow know ""What is best for us""? How are they qualified to make that judgement? Simply because they were alive back then? I'm sorry, to me that is not enough to take their opinions as anything more than nostalgic reminiscing.

We can take a few things as facts. The system you seem to be advocating failed, utterly and completely. USSR fell apart and non-Russian states left as soon as they possibly could, much to their delight.

2506,"""The so-called romanticization of the Soviet past doesn’t necessarily equal a wish for the Soviet system’s return."" ""Today's state capitalism is viewed as unfair: the injustice is in  distribution, access to goods and infrastructure. And this feeling is  growing stronger.""

When people think and talk about the Soviet era, they do it in comparison with the after 90's and present times. This survey is a criticism of the current political, social and economic condition of the post-soviet era. The new regimes promised social stability, good life, justice and freedom, but they failed to accomplish them. The post-soviet times have been filled with deep poverty, corruption, social-economic instability and many people live worse life than before, that makes them nostalgic about the past. The changes didn't give them confidence in the future and good life, the Western-type political, economic and social models give them more fears than hopes.  

Even if 75% of Russians say Soviet era was 'Greatest Time' in country’s history, only 28% of them can see the future stability in returning to the model of the Soviet Union. The majority, fifty-eight said they support Russia's “own, special way” rejecting the other Union mechanism, ""the European path of development."" The real question is, what kind of ""special way"" will lead to the future of Russia and whether it will be a better future leading to another ""Great Time"" of the country.",,/r/europe/comments/fp3w7l/75_of_russians_say_soviet_era_was_greatest_time/fljj5ci/,FDGirl22,1585214823

2513,"This is a really simplified view. According to:

https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/life-expectancy

life expectancy in the US in 1965 was 70.21, in 2019 - 78.87, that's a clear difference.

I know it's not the best time to talk about deadly diseases but even in the 1960s there were still a lot of hardly diseases that are easily curable now and the mere fact that we're panicking over a virus with mortality rate around 3% (and probably much lower given how many cases will go unnoticed and people won't even know they had the coronavirus) only shows how much our standards have changed (grown). 

&gt;Typical boomer path: finish high school, maybe get a uni degree, get an easygoing job that gets a salary which is enough to buy a home, have kids, save money, travel etc

This is a typical boomer path only in millenials' minds. There were also poor people, criminals, people who committed suicide because they couldn't handle pressure at work, there were also incels who couldn't talk to girls, just they didn't have a place to gather in and discuss their problems, they simply died forgotten and shunned by the society and obviously, the only boomers who have children and can tell them how perfect life was back then are those who actually succeeded at life.

2517,"Personally I don't think this will have much of an effect at this point.  People are already mostly scared and staying at home, and there are quite significant restrictions in force already.  Sure, there are lots of examples of someone still going to a mökki (summer cottage) in the middle of nowhere, or having parties, or going to bars or something, and all of this is of course irresponsible now, but the vast majority of people don't do that.  That's why traffic and bus/train passenger numbers are already a fraction of what they normally are, and most restaurants, bars and hotels were already forced to close.  Ski resorts in Lapland now have closed too, and the government is shutting down the remaining restaurants.

There is simply not much ""unnecessary"" travel happening by this point anymore.  Those who wanted to barricade at their mökki already did so, or still can do this today (since restrictions would be in order from tomorrow at the earliest).  And ""necessary"" travel will still be allowed, including trucks, commuting to work (a significant fraction of population of cities like Lahti or Hämeenlinna, outside Uusimaa, commute to Helsinki area daily from ~100 km away) and weighty personal reasons, so it's not like the Uusimaa quarantine will be anywhere near absolute.

(Of course this is personally annoying for me too, as I officially live in Espoo (in Uusimaa) and my girlfriend in Jyväskylä (outside Uusimaa), and we're currently in Jyväskylä, so we either need to return to Espoo today, or be separated for weeks in best case.

2548,"&gt; The bolsheviks weren't aliens. They were the people of Russia rebelling against imperial dictatorship. Rebelling for bread, land and freedom.

&gt; The whites supported the empire and were backed French and British, who invaded Russia and murdered the people.

The bolsheviks didn't make a coup against an imperial dictatorship. The empire was dissolved in February already. They made a coup against a provisional government made of members of the elected Duma, and they made a coup against the other socialist parties in the soviets. ""All power to the soviets"" they said, but the first thing they did was take the power away from the soviets or any people's assembly and give it to their own Sovnarkom, composed by only Bolsheviks and Left SRs, who only lasted in the government for 4 months before being also purged.

&gt; An outright lie. Under the tsar it was fuedal serfdom for most.

Serfdom was abolished by tsar Alexander II on the 1860s, 60 years before the revolution.

&gt; Despite a devastating world war, a revolution where they had to fight the whites, French, brits and Germans which also devastated the country.

The French and Brit contribution was minimal besides the occupation of Murmansk. The enemies of the Reds included the real whites (gentry and imperial officers and bureaucrats) but also everybody who was not a Bolshevik. Mensheviks, SRs, Left SRs, Kadets, anarchists, Ukrainian, Georgian, Tukestani, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian nationalists who wanted independence for their countries. The Reds were not the good guys, they just won the war because they controlled the Russian core and most of the population while their enemies were divided.

During the Civil War they provoked a famine that killed 5 million people because of their food requisitions to the peasants. They enslaved the workers into their working spaces to force production because they had no other way of keeping them in their job places. They crushed the Krondstadt saliors, the ones who whelped them do the October coup. They murdered the political and religious leaders of the Turkestan and created a Russian-only Soviet Executive Committee in a region where they were a tiny minority. They invaded independent Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and tried to force the Baltic countries too (so much for the freedom of the peoples). Ukraine I don't include because it's a whole other mess.

The peasants got land and freedom during the revolution, and took it from the gentry and big landlords, but then came the Bolsheviks from the cities and stole their food and grain. The peasants revolted all around the country, specially in Tambov, Tula and other regions. The bloodbath was so dire that Lenin finally had to admit defeat and conceded the NEP to the peasants, which was dubbed a ""peasant Brest-Litovsk"" by the Bolsheviks.

And what about collectivization? The greatest of all sins in Soviet History. Around 7 to 14 million people died because of it, when 250 000 bolsheviks radical youths were sent to the countryside to force all peasants into kolkhozes and sovkhozes. They invented terrible terms like ""kulak in spirit"" for poor peasants who opposed collectivization. They forced traditionally nomad kazakhs into collective farms, which just provoked the death of 90% of their cattle and 10-20% of their population.

And what about the invasion of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania during WWII? What about the deportation of ""enemy peoples"" including the Crimean Tatars, the Chechens, the Volga Germans, the Cossacks and many other ethnicities?

&gt; Despite all that they managed to get rid of homelessness, increase the diet, vastly increase literacy. And start Industrialisation, raising living standards.

Many other countries managed to do that, and none payed such a high price for it. Except for China, which followed the same Marxist-Leninist path, what a coincidence. And this sounds just like those in my country who praise Franco because he built dams, created social security and living standards were raised. Well no shit Sherlock, if he didn't even manage to do that in 40 years in power he would've been terrible incompetent.

Of course Soviet Union managed to do some good things. Even the Nazis did that. Now, the real questions are: were those positive results worth the price that was paid in lives and suffering? and wouldn't it have been accomplished anyway under a less harsh regime?

&gt; The one where bolsheviks had a leading role? The one in which the people established councils to rule themselves, councils which overwhelmingly supported the bolsheviks?

A leading role? The bolsheviks were an important part to be sure, but they neither had a leading role nor were even a majority. The Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet in May 1917 had 72 members. Of these 23 were Mensheviks, 22 Socialist Revolutionaries and 12 Bolsheviks. The remaining 15 members' party affiliation at that time isn't known. Lenin wasn't even in the country when the Revolution started.

And the soviets did not overwhelmingly supported the bolsheviks. They only became bolshevik after the soldiers, who were mostly bolshevik affiliated, deserted the front and came back to the cities. But the popular support was not on the side of the Bolsheviks, if any party had the popular support it was the SRs. In the Constituent Elections of November 1917, already after the Bolshevik coup, with 64% turnout, gave 37.6% of vote to the Russian SRs + 13% to the Ukrainian SRs, 23% of vote to the Bolsheviks, 4.7% to Kadets, 3% to Mensheviks, 2% to the Cossacks and 16.7% to other minority parties. So Bolsheviks got 23% vs 55-60% of the vote to the other socialist parties.

If the Bolsheviks won the struggle is because they were better organized, were more zealous, had less scruples than the other parties and were supported by the soldiers. Not because they had the support of the majority of Russian people, who were mostly peasants who supported the SRs.",Catalonia,/r/europe/comments/fp3w7l/75_of_russians_say_soviet_era_was_greatest_time/fljjhb6/,SocratesTheBest,1585215243

There are several aspects to that. One is that in general water shipping is insanely cost-effective. It’s basically cargo trains on steroids. Even more difficult and expensive to create new pathways, really slow, but as far as shipping goes, real cheap. So that is a reason in and of itself. 

Secondly, this elevator is also super expensive to build, but it is an elevator. And elevators use very little energy in general due to counterweights. Other solutions I know of is putting boats on railroad carts and hauling them uphill which is greatly limited by weight or dams, which are cheap to run, but can be problematic in long canals, as they take a lot of water and are really slow so they’ll having limit the traffic. Plus in case of such insane elevation change you’d need a system of those, so I’m eyeballing some 1 hour to change the elevation for several barges going one way. And a lot of land to build them on. 

This contraption takes relatively little space, is decently quick and is safe.

2667,"&gt;it was the Bolsheviks who gave the order to murder the Imperial family on a basement in Ekaterinburg without trial just because the Whites were advancing on the city.

The bolsheviks weren't aliens. They were the people of Russia rebelling against imperial dictatorship. Rebelling for bread, land and freedom. 

The whites supported the empire and were backed French and  British, who invaded Russia and murdered the people.

Despite  a devastating world war, a revolution where they had to fight the whites, French, brits and Germans which also devastated the country. 

Despite all that they managed to get rid of homelessness, increase the diet, vastly increase literacy. And start Industrialisation, raising living standards.

2692,"It is obviously worse to have more people spreading the virus. But comparing the number of cases already in the country with the number that would potentially be imported through flights, the payoff of closing the airport/quarantining travellers is currently very small. Stopping around 10 to 100 virus-carrying travellers from entering the country doesn't help a lot if you already have at least 40000 cases in your country (conservative estimate for UK: there are probably around 3 symptom-less cases for each diagnosed case. In reality, there is also a lag between the infection and the detection of each case, so the real number is probably higher).

At this point (widr-spread infection) you need measures to contain the spread in general (lock-downs etc.). This arguably includes stopping people from traveling (which they usually do to meet other people), so maybe non-essential travel should be stopped anyways :)

If the number of cases in the country is small enough that there is a chance to stop the spread completely (through contact tracing and quarantines), quarantining travellers is very effective at slowing the spread.

The stab-in-the-back myth (German: Dolchstoßlegende, pronounced [ˈdɔlçʃtoːsleˌɡɛndə] (About this soundlisten), literally ""dagger stab legend"")[a] was the notion, widely believed and promulgated in right-wing circles in Germany after 1918, that the German Army did not lose World War I on the battlefield but was instead betrayed by the civilians on the home front, especially the republicans who overthrew the Hohenzollern monarchy in the German Revolution of 1918–19. Advocates denounced the German government leaders who signed the Armistice on November 11, 1918, as the ""November Criminals"" (German: November­verbrecher).

When the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, they made the legend an integral part of their official history of the 1920s, portraying the Weimar Republic as the work of the ""November criminals"" who stabbed the nation in the back to seize power while betraying it. The Nazi propaganda depicted Weimar as ""a morass of corruption, degeneracy, national humiliation, ruthless persecution of the honest 'national opposition'—fourteen years of rule by Jews, Marxists, and 'cultural Bolsheviks', who had at last been swept away by the National Socialist movement under Adolf Hitler and the victory of the 'national revolution' of 1933"".[1]

2875,"&gt; The plan 2 weeks ago was to introduce measures at the appropriate time, as led by the scientific evidence, to minimise deaths. There was never any fixed timetable to actions to be taken. You can listen to the plan being laid out by the CMO on the 5th of March here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfJcwDaZrsA . Nothing has changed from that plan and measures continue to be taken at a time that is appropriate based on the scientific evidence.

The only thing that changed is the Imperial College study that gave nothing but actual projection numbers in terms of deaths. Everyone said it when the UK announced its plan that it was insanity because of the number of people who would die. Everyone. There was zero new science behind the backtracking but pure panic because these kind of casualties are simply not acceptable in a first world country like the UK. This is an utter failure to acknowledge the reality of the situation from the beginning.

&gt; You answered to someone pointing out in response to a claim that there had been no good news from the UK that there had in fact been such good news. Your ill-informed response was that the UK 'is not doing better in anything' (proceeding to say that the statistics don't matter).

I said the number of deaths is meaningless for now. You don't draw a conclusion after the first weeks of campaign in a war that is going to last months or even years. This is nonsense.

&gt; You then described the British response as an 'utter disaster', 'complete panic', and 'pure blind nationalism'. So please quit your bullshit in attempting to say you weren't imply that the UK response was worse than anyone else. You're not 'just disagreeing', you are making hugely dramatised, exaggerated, and ill-informed comments.

The UK's response was absolutely an utter disaster. Again, everyone and their mother said that it was pure insanity and a gamble that would cost too much if it didn't work out. And it was ditched in panic. It was, this is what happened. I don't know what you're trying to argue here.

&gt; As for the link, thank you for that. It hadn't been reported as being on that level in the English language press.

Media report national news mostly these days but yeah, again unemployment benefits are on that level during normal times in France which is something Macron is trying to cut down massively, so it's not news when it's normal.

And you just stated that your country is made of rednecks, therefore we can say that you're part of the inbred gang

I have said "" I don't care about rednecks of my country dear redneck"" which means Turkey does have rednecks and I don't give s\* about them so you shouldn't as well because your sh\*ty country also have them. The funny thing is I have never seen more rednecks than in Europe in anywhere not even in US. Also about the money thing I'am not sure about that mate. I mean I'am sure if you aren't coming from a multi millionaire family I don't think you can have more money than my ""whole family"", but if you like to share your yearly income I can answer that for you. Also this inbred thing becomes rich when it comes from the Europeans which are the inbred capital of the world. I think you don't even know your own history.

&gt;Thank you for the good laugh. You lost. Haftar hold almost the whole country. They can take Tripoli tomorrow. They don't do it because they don't want a massacre. All the Libyan tribes are with Haftar. Do you even know how Libya works? This means the people is with Haftar. Also you don't have a new EEZ deal. That's why he doesn't talk about it anymore. He lost by international law. And he lost politically. Everyone said it isn't valid. In fact North Africa ridiculed Erdogan lol. They all made fun of him. The best part is when Algeria said in a press conference about Greece that they are glad Greece is such good neighbor to Libya. Neighbors by the long EEZ in the Mediterranean Sea especially the long line with Crete haha. I also liked how Tunisia made fun of him after he went back to Turkey all triumphant haha. What a clown lol

Haftar's land grab doesn't mean anything we made a deal we interrupted and prevented haftars advance. We got our EEZ deal. ? All wahhabi/extremist/radical islamist Libyans are with Haftar that's correct. Also that EEZ deal is in place doesn't matter how much Europeans cry. It's signed and done. Also why do you think I care about Erdogan ? LMAO. Man you are seriously a lowlife who tries so hard to trigger me :) which you aren't pushing the right buttons mate. Try your luck with Atatürk rather than Erdogan when you come up against Kemalist Turks, I can assure you triggering chances will be muuuuuuch higher.

Edit : Also you were pretty unlucky on your triggering attempts mate as you can understand I'am a secular/Kemalist who despise Erdogan, soo bad luck there and I was listening to this [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwZiwdU_0bU) while reading your comment which made me almost impossible to be triggered :)

&gt;I agree except they won't come to Europe. Like the EU said, Greece is the shield of Europe. And Erdogan made it clear that the migrants are a weapon and an army. The only thing that he did is strengthen Europe.

The thing you don't understand there were only few thousand refugees in borders which caused all this shenanigans. Now think about millions. Think about Turkish state cutting all refugee support policies which things like ""monetary help, free education, free healthcare etc.etc."" And with a few propaganda news against refugees I can assure you that you can create a hell for refugees in Turkey which they would do everything to go Europe then. They don't doing that right now because they are comfy in Turkey they have no reason. hence only few thousand opportunist tries their chance in Greek borders.

1) Italy's problem is not its trading relationships. In fact the country has a large positive trade balance, while it had deficits during several periods of intense economic growth. 

2)  Devaluation can increase the competitivness for low end exports in the short term, but most of that moved to Asia decades ago, and is market inefficient anyway for a first world nation. For higher tech exports, monetary stability is more important. In addition, deflation disincentivises investments in productivity making your industries, less competitive long term. 

3) Italy's main problem has been a lack of productivity growth since the 90ties. A major part of this is that the countrys SMEs did not embrace the IT revolution in the same way as others.

2950,"&gt;By the way, constantly reposting the same excerpt all across the page is hardly convincing at all. Especially one taken wildly out of context and ignores centuries of that tax being made better or worse for those placed under it, cultures and laws are in flux as time goes on not static. It's not even a unique tax law. The Italian City-States, the Holy Roman Empire, England, Spain and even Constantinople before it fell had similar tax laws regarding the Romani peoples, Jewish people, pagans and other minorities. In fact, in a lot of these Christian countries at the time it was illegal to be anything other than Christian. At the same time this tax was going on several countries in Europe were shipping debtors and those who failed to pay taxes off to penal colonies.

You are talking about my excerpt meanwhile you are giving 0 sources to back up your claims. Which is funny. I'm going to quote actual facts as much as i want too.

&gt; You're taking a singular tax law and pretending that it is the worse thing in the world and worse than what anyone else would do.

Never mentioned it being the worst thing in the world or worst than what other forms of slavery existed. Not sure were you came up with that. What i'm saying is that claiming that it wasn't slavery is just factually wrong. Simple as that. 


&gt; The only slavery mentioned is that debtors were sold into slavery

False again

I'm seeing a pattern of you either having a hard time reading things (which should be worrying you) **or** you being conveniently forgetful. 

Things i also talked about : [Devshirme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devshirme) also known as Blood Tax **was the Ottoman Empire practice of recruiting soldiers and bureaucrats from among the children of their Balkan Christian subjects.[3] Ottoman soldiers would take Christian boys, ages 8 to 20, away from their parents in Eastern and Southeastern Europe and removing them to Istanbul.[4] The boys were then force-converted to Islam[5] with the primary objective of selecting and training the best children and teenagers for the military or civil service of the empire, notably into the Janissaries.** 

Also i mentioned the [odalisques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odalisque), non muslim girls who were taken and made to serve as , basically sex maids/servants in harems. [Ottoman Imperial Harem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Imperial_Harem) 

&gt;The harem was the ultimate symbol of the Sultan's power. His ownership of women, mostly slaves, was a sign of wealth, power, and sexual prowess. The institution was introduced in the Turkish society with adoption of Islam, under the influence of the Arab Caliphate, which the Ottomans emulated. To ensure the obedience of the women, many of them were bought and kept into slavery. 

&gt; However, not all members of the Harem were slaves. The main wives, especially those taken into marriage to consolidate personal and dynastic alliances were free women. **This was the exception, not the rule.** The relationship between slavery and polygamy/harems in the Turkish Harem continued until 1908, at the very least


These again are slave practices.




&gt; that is not the entire populace of Greece being enslaved.

Nobody said it was, the entire populace of Africa wasn't enslaved either. 

&gt;And if you think Muslims were never in danger of being enslaved or being considered slaves, then you do not know a thing about the Ottoman Empire, it's cultures or it's beliefs. So yeah, I read what you posted, I've seen what you've posted all over the thread. It's just that what you typed is partially untrue, exaggerated and ignoring context to fit an agenda.

How they treated their staff, put profits first and I backed it up with sources every step of the way so that we would always remember how they acted.

I’m sick and tired of them being villainous and us being outraged only for the world to forget in 3 months time. I want them to be remembered for what they did during this period.

On the flipside, I also detail all the billionaires, corporations and celebs that acted as heroes throughout the pandemic (as well as the hard working people in the essential industries like medical, supermarkets, public transport, banking and so much more! I can’t thank them enough). Who put their lives on the line every day to make sure we get through this.

I’m working alone and scouring the web in my free time to document this and made an easy to search site for corporations, billionaires and celebs so you can see what they did.

It’s easy to use. Just go to [https://didtheyhelp.com](https://didtheyhelp.com/) and type a company or celeb name.

If someone is missing and you want to nominate them to be a hero or zero - nominate them (with a source - otherwise I won’t accept it) to: [nominate@didtheyhelp.com](mailto:nominate@didtheyhelp.com)

Everyone starts are ZERO - if they do nothing, they don't go on the site and remain at zero. The site is to document who acted badly and who went out of their way to do good. I will take note of all nominations posted here if you provide a link/source as you will notice all claims are sourced on the site.

2. The owner of the company sold his stocks, yes, but he got only like a couple thousand PLN out of it, wouldn't even really be enough for the bribes.

3095,"&gt; So how does that work?

If you go back far enough, and pick any random person, that person is either related to _everyone_ alive, or no one. 

Since we know the royals family tree, we know the royal at time x, say 1000 years ago, are related to the royals today. That means that they are also related to every single person alive.

[This video explains it nicely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm0hOex4psA)

tl;dw: Everyone in Europe should have a common ancestor around 26 generations ago, 800-1000 years ago. And 46 generations ago, everyone should have the same ancestors, meaning we are related to everyone who lived in 700 (who had kids whos line survive today). And about 4000-7000 years ago, everyone in the universe should have the same ancestors.

In the early nineties after the reunification there were *lynchmobs in East Germany* - while the police stood by and watched.

Acting like those two are even remotely the same is just disingenuous.

And this isn't about shifting the blame away from the people in East Germany right now (though again, it's not an East German only problem)... It's about how the blame constantly gets shifted to DDR as an institution, even though it didn't exist at this point and hasn't existed for 30 years. The wall has been down longer than it ever was up. Sorry, but there is no situation where a 22 year old who is a Neo Nazi today (like the people we're talking about) is in that situation solely or even mainly because of anything DDR did. A 22 year old today was born in 1998. They didn't learn any brainwashed DDR oppression or whatever bullshit gets sprouted on here, they're the product of post-reunification politics and a post reunification society. Why can't we focus on that? Why can't we try to figure out what is going wrong right now in our society, and what has been going wrong since the reunification, that leads to people acting like that?

The announcement comes after the Government asked 250,000 people to come forward to help the health service as it faces its biggest challenge since its inception.

Mr Johnson, speaking at the daily press conference inside Number 10, said he wanted to offer a “special thank you to everyone who has now volunteered to help the NHS”.

“When we launched the appeal last night, we hoped to get 250,000 volunteers over a few days.

“But I can tell you that in just 24 hours, 405,000 people have responded to the call.”
Coronavirus testing kits are coming, despite 'global bottleneck'
The UK’s chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said there was a “global bottleneck” on buying more testing kits.

Speaking at the press conference, he said it was the Government’s aim to be able to buy tests that would allow NHS workers to go back to work if they test negative for coronavirus.

“This is a global problem – every country wants this new test for a disease that wasn’t being tested for anywhere three months ago,” he said.

“Everybody wants it so there is a global shortage and that’s a bottleneck for us.

“The next priority is to get critical workers back to work or to say to them, ‘You have got it’. We definitely would like that.”

Authorities have said more than 8,000 people have contracted the deadly virus in the UK so far.

The youngest victim has been named by her family as a 21-year-old from High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire.

Chloe Middleton had no pre-existing health conditions, her family said in a statement released on social media.

The conference comes after the Government introduced a lockdown on the United Kingdom, seeing the majority of shops and businesses closed, bar those deemed essential.

Millions of Britons have been told to stay at home, with police enforcing the rules on those that defy the orders.

It is anticipated the rules will be reviewed in three weeks, at which point officials will make a decision to end the measures or extend them further.",,/r/europe/comments/fowppn/prime_minister_boris_johnson_reveals_405000/flhm85v/,bataneyelid,1585165325

3328,"And I disagree with that - there was not a massive amount of Nazis in East Germany. Like maybe there were people that were secretly agreeing with Nazi ideals the way people like that exist in any society, but they were not organized into mobs or any sort of systemic structures and they were not openly talking about or acting on these ideas.

And in the nineties, as a direct consequence of the reunification, it *exploded*. That's what always bothers me about putting it like that (and that's not an attack on you, but it's the definitely how it's framed in modern Germany) - everything that is good about the reunification (your ""civic democratic self-consciousness"") gets attributed to the reunification and therefore the Federal Republic of Germany and everything that is bad (like the explosion of Neo Nazis) gets attributed to the DDR.

But the thing is, the conditions that made them would never have occured in DDR. Look at cases like Amadeu Antonio - police officers of the Federal Republic of Germany were literally standing by without intervening as a racist mob murdered a legal migrant worker because he was black. And that was not an isolated case. Something like that did not and would not have happened in DDR - if anything the state would have been *too* repressive as a response, but it was normal for the East Germany of the 90s and this non-intervention (along with active help from the Neo Nazi hotbeds in Verfassungsschutz and Police) were what actually grew the modern Neo Nazi movement.

But instead of acknowledging that, we're rather blaming DDR

You brought up the topic of indoctrionation, while it has been Spain that has been showing a country that is not real to their citizens since there's television.

15-20% of the people in your country aren't native Spanish speakers, but your country's public media doesn't ever show them to your population.

The closest practice to real slavery was devshirme, but it's hardly slavery itself.

&gt;Greek Christian families were, however, subject to a system of brutal forced conscription known as the devshirme. The Ottomans required that male children from Christian peasant villages be conscripted and enrolled in the corps of Janissaries for military training in the Sultan's army.[11] Such recruitment was sporadic, and the proportion of children conscripted varied from region to region. The practice largely came to an end by the middle of the seventeenth century.

Obviously we don't control each and every single action of each other (that'd defeat the point of multiple moderators) but between reviews of cases where users request them, taking ""big decisions"" (such as removing/approving popular threads/ban reviews) collectively or having internal guidelines regarding how we handle specific violations it'd be hard to continuously show bias in situations where it really matters without anyone else in the team noticing.

In general the milder a rule violation the more leeway we give each other, the harsher it is the less leeway we have.

&gt;can you say this will not color the opinion of some within the team? truly for certain? if yes, how can you be certain?

Of course it influences us, in my personal opinion it's quite literally impossible to not have any biases - the best we can do is recognize them and act accordingly.

so just because some other leader is winning elections time after time, we should not call him dictator by default.

maybe Russians who live in Russia and vote (majority as is always case in democracies) just like Putin. They dont care if anyone outside of Russia likes him or not - thats not his primary job, his primary job is to work for benefit of Russia and Russian people.

3856,"&gt; Only a fool who is uneducated about history would make such a moronic statement. The Ottoman Empire varied region to region. The revolution took place primarily in the Peloponnese, the Morea. The Morea was not under control of the Ottomans for centuries it changed hands constantly between the Ottomans and the Venetians. And the Greeks did not wait centuries, they revolted prior to this, aiding the Venetians and more recently during the Orlov revolt

You are willfully twisting history to fit the narrative of the Greek state. First you made universal statements regarding the ""barbarism"" of Ottomans, now you are backpedaling saying it varied from one region to another. An intelligent person would ask, if this is indeed the case, what makes the Peloponnese special for the more heavy handed approach of the Ottomans. Your ridiculous response is that local Ottoman administrators were randomly more cruel there. The real answer to that question is that due to its strategic position, Morea, was a natural place for naval powers to compete over. This has nothing to do with the local population, Greek or Albanian. Also, Morea is very small part of the Greek mainland and an even smaller part of the total Greek population under the Ottoman Empire. So my original response to you is valid. Only a fool who cannot think for himself would believe that Greeks were systematically tortured for centuries. 

Ypsilanthis came from a wealthy Phanariot family who served in the Ottoman administration. He was a man with political ambitions, so he struggled against the Ottomans not out of principle but out of expediency. I believe it is not his contributions to the Greek revolt but his work for the Russian Empire that is worthy of discussion. Other names you mention, one of which is another Phanariot, were not ""men of action"".

You are randomly pulling out names but the truth remains that many bandits, including Kolokotronis, were ethnic Albanians. Given the current political climate between Albania and Greece over Epirus, this fact is again shrouded in the fog created by national myths.",,/r/europe/comments/foffth/25th_of_march_199_years_ago_greeks_in_southern/flfy1f6/,LaReineDepee,1585122359

3901,"Sweden has become an international outlier in its response to the deadly coronavirus outbreak by keeping schools open and adopting few other restrictions, as the Scandinavian nation embarks on what one health expert called a “huge experiment”. 

Since the UK went into lockdown on Monday evening, Sweden is the largest European country with the fewest limits on where people can go and what they can do. Schools for children up to the age of 16 remain open, many people continue to go to work and packed commuter trains and buses were reported this week in the capital Stockholm. “Clearly Sweden stands out at the moment,” said Carl Bildt, the former prime minister.
Swedish authorities have banned public gatherings of more than 500 people, closed universities and higher education colleges, and advised workers to stay at home if possible. Authorities on Tuesday ordered restaurants and bars only to serve people at tables rather than at the bar.

Local media have been full of stories of thousands of people gathering at Swedish ski resorts, which until Saturday kept their nightlife open. The virus has previously spread easily in mountain resorts in Austria and Italy.
Johan Carlson, head of Sweden’s public health agency, last week defended Sweden’s approach, saying the country “cannot take draconian measures that have a limited impact on the epidemic but knock out the functions of society.”

But he conceded that the 90,000 figure for the number of people who die annually in Sweden would “increase significantly” if its healthcare system became overburdened.
There have been just over 2,000 reported Covid-19 cases in Sweden and 33 deaths. That compares with more than 6,000 deaths in Italy, Europe’s worst affected country.

“The future still looks manageable,” said Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s state epidemiologist who has become one of the public faces of the outbreak. He argued that schools needed to stay open to provide childcare for health workers, noting that young people appeared to have much lower infection rates.

But a significant number of Swedish health experts disagree. Mr Tegnell has faced a barrage of criticism after details of the country’s antivirus tactics leaked to Swedish TV at the weekend. 
Joacim Rocklov, an epidemiologist at Umea University, said the Swedish authorities were taking huge risks with public health when so much remained unknown about the coronavirus. 

“I do not see why Sweden would be so different from other countries. It is a huge experiment,” he told the Financial Times. “We have no idea — it could work out. But it could also go crazily in the wrong direction.” 
Swedish authorities have said they are not explicitly pursuing a strategy of “herd immunity”, where a large segment of the population contracts the virus in order for society to build up immunity. The UK’s chief scientific adviser suggested last week that Britain has adopted such an approach before the government backtracked.
Sweden is instead seeking to slow the spread of infections and ensure that its health system does not become overwhelmed. Mr Bildt said the situation on the streets of Stockholm had changed “dramatically” in recent weeks despite the absence of legal restrictions, with many fewer people going outside. 

But Mr Rocklov said it was not yet known how long immunity to Covid-19 would last. “There is a big risk that Sweden would have to go into quarantine when the health system goes into crisis,” he added.
Sweden’s relaxed approach contrasts with its Nordic neighbours. Denmark, Norway and Finland have closed schools, sealed their borders and imposed other restrictions.

Stefan Lofven, Sweden’s centre-left prime minister, has called on everyone to play a part in stopping the virus from spreading by, for instance, not visiting elderly relatives and working from home. He used a televised address to the nation on Sunday to warn that more restrictive measures might come as he conceded the next few months would be difficult. 

“There are a few crucial moments in life when you have to make sacrifices, not only for your own sake but also in order to take responsibility for the people around you, for your fellow human beings, and for our country. That moment is now. That day is here. And that duty belongs to everyone,” he said.
Sweden’s strategy has also been criticised for a different reason, with some arguing that the damage it could cause to the economy is too high. Kerstin Hessius, a prominent fund manager, is one of those arguing that the country may be swapping one disaster for an even worse one.

Her views provoked a repost from Leaf Östling, former chief executive of truckmaker Scania, who accused her of living in a “financial bubble”. He urged Swedes not to become cynical and to hold to their “humanist viewpoint”. 
Mr Rocklov said it was a “valid discussion” to have over whether the measures aimed at saving lives may do even more damage. But he also said Swedish authorities were not giving enough information for people to make up their own mind.

“More and more experts are feeling uneasy with this stewardship. It is not allowing for an open debate. It is rather trying to push down and make people quiet.”",Lake Bled connoisseur,/r/europe/comments/foktt1/sweden_bucks_global_trend_with_experimental_virus/flfq95u/,MelodicBerries,1585113973

4029,"[Why Italy Is So Prone to Earthquakes](https://time.com/4464118/italy-earthquake-seismologist-explains-why-common/)

&gt; The Earth’s shell is divided into several major tectonic plates. Southern Italy is very close to the line where the Eurasian and African plates meet and constantly grate against each other creating seismic and volcanic tension. Italy’s major volcanoes such as Etna, Stromboli and Vesuvius lie close to this fault.
&gt;
&gt;In addition, Italy has a series of smaller fault lines, particularly along the Appenine Mountains.
&gt;
&gt;The Apennine range, or Apennines Mountains, is a mountain range that runs from north to south along the country, “essentially like a geological spine of Italy,” says De Angelis. Relatively shallow earthquakes are fairly common along the entire length of these mountains due to the number of faults which run along the range, which can rupture and cause earthquakes.
&gt;
&gt;“So different movement goes on around Italy and there are many faults and areas of weakness in the crust,” says De Angelis. “This results in complex tectonic movement in that region.”

I guess you haven't been paying attention. Russian borders in Crimea are respected by all, including sea and air.

The US for example aggressively pursues signaling in territorial disputes with say some islands China claims, but nobody does so with Crimea.

When Ukraine called for a NATO mission to the Sea of Azov, they were simply ignored. 

Actions speak louder than words.

&gt;Is that why your government is working hard to buy off corrupt African governments to withdraw their recognition of Kosovo?

As I've said, it is a cute metric to pursue, but their diplomatic campaign amounts to nothing in the end. It's something they can domestically present as an achievement.",,/r/europe/comments/fof1ij/nato_bombing_of_fr_yugoslavia_in_which_many_serbs/flf9i2g/,M-84,1585101104

4250,"Yeah, but it still makes a large difference.  The European Single Market is $20 trillion.  The single-largest entity within which trade is not counted as an export is gonna be Germany, at $3.863 trillion.  (Not that the SM is a free trade area, but you get my drift.)  NAFTA is $24.8 trillion, and the largest entity there is the US, at $21.439 trillion.  The bulk of commerce in NAFTA isn't gonna show up as an export or import, because it's predominantly some entity in the US dealing with some other entity in the US.

This has actually been an annoyance in the past, because I've often wanted export or import numbers for the EU (not the European Single Market) as a whole, and they aren't readily-available.

Of course, the flip side of that is that sometimes I've wanted economic numbers for a single US state, and often *those* are hard to get, so I guess you win some and you lose some.

EDIT: I'd also guess, even aside from the bloc issue, that a more-interesting statistic, if one is looking for what I think OP wants, is who has the largest *net* toilet paper import/exports, because one roll is really probably a pretty good substitute good for another roll, if what we're really asking is ""when the shit hits the fan, who can produce toilet paper""?  I actually used this same page in a comment on this sub the other day to make that point the other day, that the US was a large net toilet paper importer, but I thought that there was a per-country import breakdown there, not per-continent.

*Goes looking*

Yeah, there is.  OP must have turned it off:

Maybe they got stolen in Germany, but that's a *lot* of masks. You're not going to get them home in your VW Polo by yourself. So it would need to be a coordinated effort by several people, not easy to do in a German airport. Not to mention your chances of selling a million masks without the police immediatly noticing right now are slim to none. Stupid idea.

To me with these stories what makes the most sense is that because of the shortage, hospitals/governments etc. are going to unknown and possible not so reputable vendors, because they'll take what they can get. And then maybe those vendors promise things they can't deliver or are just straight up trying to scam people. Or maybe someone else came along and offered twice the money.

Which is why companies or people with (business) connections to China, like Apple, VW and so on, seem to have less trouble getting equipment.

The situation was more complicated than 1 comment on reddit can explain. I'd suggest reading at least the wikipedia page on it. The bombing was both good and bad, bad because a lot of innocents died (including Albanians btw), the good was that the war finally ended and Serb forces withdrew from Kosovo.

Were a lot of the KLA leadership straight up criminals? Yes. Were a lot of the Serb leadership straight up criminals? Also yes.

But the fact of the matter was no albanian in Kosovo wanted to remain in Serbia anymore, and since Serbia wasn't giving up or even trying to appease the albanian populace (instead they went for the mass expelling and burning of houses/commiting massacres route), this bombing was the needed catalyst.

4409,"&gt;At the end of last week, a plane with a million masks was on its way to Odense University Hospital. Masks designed to prevent doctors and nurses from being infected with covid-19 and allowing healthcare professionals to infect patients. Masks that are essential for our health care system not to suddenly break due to manpower shortages.  
&gt;  
&gt;But over the weekend it turned out that the masks had never arrived. They had disappeared from the plane somewhere in Germany, and no one at the hospital in Odense knows where they ended up. Maybe at health care in another country that offered a better price.

4415,"With Russia next door, Finland is still living in the cold war era. Not only do we have things like large military and laws mandating bomb shelters in new buildings, we also have fairly substantial emergency stockpiles for a crisis situations. Now they are being accessed as there is a real risk that we are running out of medical supplies. Purchasing is hard when borders are closed and every other country also needs them.

&gt; Kuopio's Savon Sanomat is among the papers reporting that top official at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, Päivi Sillanaukee told Yle on Monday evening that Finland is opening its emergency reserve stocks, something she referred to as ""an historic day"".

&gt; ""This means, if we look at it in numbers, that a million surgical gowns, masks and hundreds of thousands of respirators will be available. They will not run out,"" Sillanaukee stated.

&gt; The tabloid Ilta-Sanomat took a look at what the national emergency reserve stockpile contains.

&gt; The reserve stocks include materials as diverse as medicines and medical equipment, fuels, bread, seeds and vegetable proteins.

&gt; By law, the reserves should be able to get the country through a year of poor harvests, with a six-month supply of grain in storage at facilities around the country, and enough imported fuel to cover five months of normal consumption.

&gt; In addition to medical supplies, food and fuel, reserve stocks also include military supplies and production equipment.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/fobbgu/finland_to_open_emergency_stocks_for_medical/fle5sii/,Pontus_Pilates,1585078126

4482,"You are really insisting on showing yourself up as utterly incompetent.

&gt;The fact that you used cumulative cases to calculate the day to day percentage gain already tells me that you have no idea what you are talking about.

The percentage of new cases will always be a function of the cumulative number of cases, you imbecile. Indirectly, as only a proportion of those will have still be actively spreading in the previous days, but the relation is there in the data. Modelling epidemics as an exponential in the total number of cases (until they inflect and plateau, of course) is standard.

&gt;The day to day percentage would always drop, even if the newly infected stayed the same.

*Exactly*, if that happened, it would mean that the measures are working, as the R_0 is going down. Meaning that just looking tat the number of newly infected would tell you absolutely nothing. Gosh, would you look at that!

&gt;In a much lesser degree.

In a much *greater* degree, you moron. There could be a difference of 3000 cases in your measurement, while in reality there could be 30,000 new cases. While the % increase should be quite similar.

&gt;Which is wrong again. They depend on the current active cases NOT the previous daily new cases nor cumulative cases (which you used). 

See above - it's an indirect relationship, and much easier to look at than using the number of active cases, which would require much more complex manipulations to see which were active at the time of infection. But of course, an idiot like you is incapable of understanding that.

&gt;But the diff in daily new gives us a much better approximation.

Really? There are 300 more cases today than yesterday. Do you think that tells you the same thing if yesterday there were 5000 total cases, or 5, you incompetent, misinformation-spreading brainlet?

&gt;Bro, new cases is already the first derivative. If you say daily new cases is larger/smaller than the day before it is second derivative.

Jesus Christ, you are an utter **moron**. No, that is not how derivatives work. "" If you say daily new cases is larger/smaller than the day before"", it is not the second derivative - the difference in new cases is the second derivative. Saying that it's larger or smaller means that you're analysing its sign, to see if the total number of cases is accelerating or decelerating, to find the inflection point.

Which means disregarding relevant information. You are only computing the *absolute value* of the derivative. Which is fucking idiotic.

What's the derivative of an exponential, you Dunning-Krugered imbecile? Computing the % increase tells you what the derivative *is*, not just its value. What you are suggesting is pretty much a primitive approach that assumes we don't actually have a model of what an epidemic looks like, and are forced to assume that it's just some arbitrary function.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/fo8rx6/jump_in_italy_death_toll_italy_has_just_reported/fle7xp4/,unsilviu,1585079273

Definition of what an ICU bed is is not standardized. Some countries use stricter criteria than others. Every surgery and recovery room has ICU comparable equipment but they might or might not be counted as ICU beds in those statistics already.

Many countries have extra stuff in reserves for emergency situations. That might be secret information and completely missing out from statistics. Military forces often have plenty of equipment to treat patients on field.

There are probably quite a few people who lived a quiet, saintly life and who went to Heaven, but there isn't a lot of evidence or public renown for them.

4633,"&gt; ""átvette"" az irányítást egy döntés- és valószínűleg érdemben működésképtelen

Miért lenne egy önkormányzat alpolgármester nélkül működésképtelen? Hiszen az egy nagyrészt formális pozíció, a képviselők közül választva. 

Ignorálod a többit is: szerinted akkor is kulcskérdés lett volna a testületi tiszteletdíjak csökkentése, Komló esetében lenullázása, ha 100%-ban fideszes lenne? A két korábbi városban a polgármester egyedül fogadta el a 2020-as költségvetést, ennek sincs direkt járványügyi vonatkozása. 

A kormánynál maradva tegnap sunyin, szakmai vagy a fővárossal való előzetes egyeztetés nélkül[ történt ez](https://index.hu/kultur/2020/03/24/megszavaztak_a_kormany_kivesz_tobb_szinhazat_karacsonyek_kezebol/).

Ennek fényében nem tudok mit mondani arra, hogy szerinted a Guardian és a többi külföldi lap paranoiás és sosem történne meg az, amiről vizionálnak, hiszen már történik.

* Or she's aware that nobody is blocking food or essential personnel, and what she actually means is she really wants open borders as if nothing is happening, only she's at least marginally aware of how stupid it is so she's trying to hide it behind weasel words

Oh and by the way, another fascinating proposal from this useless hag was that instead of blocking travel (of all people!) completely, governments should check everyone's temperature at the border. Which is a really genius idea, because 1) it's completely useless against a disease that only presents symptoms after a week or two while the infected remain infections the whole time, and 2) it's a massive waste of resources and manpower that are sorely needed elsewhere.

Not a harder time that we'll have if the people who are supposed to save lives in the epicenter of the fucking pandemic have to stop working because they're sick and they would spread the disease to at risk patients.

&gt;We are not ""stockpiling"", we are protecting our workers, sounds different right?

No, it fucking doesn't. That's how you protect workers, by stockpiling masks so they have them.

Protecting healthcare workers in Madrid is more essential right now when there are 350+ people dying in the region every fucking day, they're storing dead bodies in an ice skating ring because they ran out of space, and they're letting people over 65 die because there aren't enough intensive care beds to go around. Hence why they're taking them away masks meant for workers in fuck knows what in Galicia.

&gt;What do we tell this people them? Well we can't provide you masks, but you have to come to work anyways, so suck it up.

4860,"Brussels has a great deal of control but nothing compared to a sovereign entity. At the end of the day Washington has greater financial power over California then Brussels has with France. I have never heard a financial expert question that.

All 16 german states have their own finances just as the 50 US states do. They are government entities after all. That does not mean that the federal government does not have the legal obligation to step in during a crisis. 

For example when Detriot went bankrupt, Michigan asked the federal government to step in and legally the federal government has to take on Detriots finances. It had to come in and make sweeping federal changes. For instance, the US federal government forced detriot to sell most of the art in its museums to finance the city, then the Smithsonian, a federal institute loaned Detriot their art to display and make money off tourism revenue.

Germany has these same powers over its states, but not other nations. When Greece went bankrupt it would not do these things, nor would Greece, a sovereign state, except these measures. Germany cannot force Greece to sell its art to keep it afloat. Germany cannot send in ""Financial czars"" ,as the US did in Detroit, to oversee Greeces finances. That's still the job of the Greek government.

While you may feel the EU should be compared to the US in this regard, experts continue to agree they are not a single entity. Talk of measuring the EU that way died in 2008-2009 when we saw the limits of EU institutions and sovereignty of nations within the EU being exerted.

4953,"Nothing can be further from the truth. The EU voting system is built specifically to hold the big countries in check. Smaller countries get a disproportionately high amount of votes and can easily form blocking minorities because of QMV.

The EU has a massive influence as a rule setter. The internal market is so large that everyone wants access to it (including uk) and has to follow EU rules. Even the USA has to. When the EU sharpened its privacy and copyright laws, US companies were forced to follow them as well which had a huge impact. While the UK was trying to figure out what it wanted with brexit we established trade deals with Japan, Canada, Mexico, Vietnam, Mercosur and Australia. They all had to adapt to adhere to EU internal market rules. So much for ""no influence out of Europe"". If I were you I'd read some articles by Andrew Moravcsik, Mark Leonard and John McCormick because I am getting the feeling that you don't know what you are talking about here.

Next point. The EU is a confederation of some sorts, with a common foreign and security policy (cfsp) agreed to by the member states. The foreign policy of member states falls within the commonly agreed framework of the cfsp. As you said so well before, cooperating with a greater power can be beneficial.

Now, you argue that the EU's legitimacy is at stake post brexit. Well, Britain has always taken a different role within EU than other countries. Vetoing a lot of proposals. A lot of Brits never felt European anyway. You can actually see that the public image of and trust in the EU has never been better in the entire history of the organisation than now. Go and check the polls. Whatever Boris or Murdoch's toilet papers want to tell you, it is not reality.

We're gonna be just fine. As someone who feels very European, I don't think anyone is gonna try and take our identity away from us any time soon like in the UK. Support for leaving the EU is just too low, despite all the extreme right propaganda.

&gt;and by this point the Serbian army was in a full ethnic cleansing campaign which created nearly 600,000 refugees

The ethnic cleansing started when NATO started bombing, not before it. Before that the war was relatively small scale. 
[More here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_in_the_Kosovo_War#Persecution_and_ethnic_cleansing). 

&gt;NATO intervention lasted 78 days and effectively obliterated the Serbian army and Yugoslav state apparatus, 

obliterated? NATO had to lie about the effectiveness of it's own operation. [More on that here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia#Military_casualties)  

There are even reports of cancer rates spiking in NATOs own troops due to their own use of depleted uranium, and among the citizens in Kosovo and Metohija. 

&gt;In the last decade or two of controversial, and, let's say less than successful interventions mainly in the Middle East, we can remember some 1990s successes.

So successful, it, without UN authorization (before somebody would say 'But RusSiA WoUld BloCk It AnYwAy, not that UN did in fact give it's consent for the use of force in the Bosnian War). The Operation escalated the violence from a terrorist insurgency to a full on ethnic war.  

The Operation itself also had numerous fuck ups, like bombings of hospitals,TV stations, passenger trains. 

And most importantly the Operation itself paved the way for the ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Roma (almost all of the Roma from Kosovo and Metohija are in Serbia now) 
[Here it says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_in_the_Kosovo_War#Ethnic_cleansing) 
&gt;During the Kosovo War, over 90,000 Serbian and other non-Albanian refugees fled the war-torn province. In the days after the Yugoslav Army withdrew, over 164,000 Serbs (around 75%) and 24,000 Roma (around 85%) left Kosovo and many of the remaining civilians were victims of abuse.[

The difference being Serbs can't return to Kosovo and Metohija,  due to constant harassment and sabotage, while the Albanians that were expelled did in fact come back almost immediately after the war. 
Crimes against Serbs continued after the war as well, most notably [Staro Gacko massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staro_Gracko_massacre)  where Serb farmers asked KFOR to help them, KFOR refused and they were all massacred by terrorists.  



And the Operation paved the way for one of the biggest peacetime attrocities: [The March pogrom of Serbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_unrest_in_Kosovo)  


Serbia sent everyone including Milosevic to the Hague for the war crimes in Kosovo and Metohija, while almost nobody got indicted for the war crimes on Serbs. Those who were [got away with killing other Albanians to silence the witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_War_crimes_witness_intimidation_and_deaths) or flat out threatened the UN when they tried to recreate crimes to investigate them as is seen in the Racak case.  

They went on to wage war against Serbia proper in [The Presevo Valley insurgency, which they lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency_in_the_Pre%C5%A1evo_Valley) and tried to do the same in [North Macedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_insurgency_in_Macedonia) which they also lost but it continues in small scale every few years.","""Свиће зора верном стаду,слога биће пораз врагу!""",/r/europe/comments/fnyc3b/operation_allied_force_began_21_years_ago_today/flcfg38/,Helskrim,1585028893

2. Something is happening to the reporting.  Either the labs aren't keeping up, something changed in the methodology, or some other snafu.  In this case, both graphs would mirror each other on the same day.

This is why I suspect that there is something going on with the reporting.

Incidentally, look at Germany's numbers.  Notice how the new cases and deaths are mirroring each other both when going down \*and\* up?  That is \*not\* how the disease works, but it \*is\* how reporting can work.  In particular, those two lower days just happen to be on the weekend.

Why under every news about Turkey there are Greece flairs spamming negative comments no matter the context?

Just another mystery of life. I guess we will know.

Real answer:

Because what Turkey did is *not* unusual in such times and also because Turkey is - i know this will shock you - too important as a country to just ""not deal with them"". Why else you think it is sanctions and warnings that get lifted after a while when people are not looking?

These are not rocket-science things to learn or find out about. Just like Turkey *needs* EU as a trade partner no matter how shitty things get, EU also *needs* Turkey in its current state. 

I mean Turkey is in top 5 or 10 for most EU countries when it comes to trade partnership and i believe 5% of all EU exports are to Turkey. 

Then there is military and trade routes and Turkish population in EU and what-not which shows EU would need a good plan first if they wanna not deal with Turkey. A plan that'll take years to implement and a lot of effort. And it is not worth the trouble.

The same could have been said about a post-fascist Greece, Portugal and Spain joining, the same could have been said about half of post-Communist Europe (and three post-Soviet countries) joining. Eastern Europeans in general still consider homosexuality to be on the same level as pederasty - this isn't a significant cultural difference? Poles and Hungarians are willing to accept a strong-man authoritarian state - this isn't a significant cultural difference?

In regards to religion - religion wildly differs in Europe, I shouldn't be telling a Czech about that. The religiosity of e.g. Poland for many in Northern Europe (and, probably, Czechia) is a significant cultural difference, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't have let them into the union.

5218,"The intervention was the second time the NATO alliance began humanitarian intervention in the Yugoslav wars, after Operation Deliberate Force  in 1995 forced war criminal Ratko Mladic and his paramilitary group to the negotiating table. Kosovo war had begun in February of the previous year, and by this point the Serbian army was in a full ethnic cleansing campaign which created nearly [600,000 refugees](http://news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/320000/images/_321823_refugee_map_1704_300.gif) by the spring and totals of 850,000 by the end of the war - in other words 90% of Kosovo Albanians became refugees from this ethnic cleansing campaign.

Besides the ethnic cleansing campaign, Albanian and Islamic cultural sites were destroyed en masse - [225/600 mosques were destroyed or damaged](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Monumente_Islamike_t%C3%AB_d%C3%ABmtuara_e_t%C3%AB_shkat%C3%ABrruara_gjat%C3%AB_Konfliktit_t%C3%AB_Kosov%C3%ABs_%281998-1999%29.jpg), 500 traditional Albanian towerhouses destroyed, 3/4 old Ottoman traditional urban centers damaged or destroyed, 65/183 public libraries - some of  which centuries old - were destroyed leading to a loss of 900,588 volumes, and records spanning over 500 years as well as precious Persian manuscripts dating back to the 12th century were gone.

And more important than those, 8,676 unarmed Albanian civilians were killed by Serbian troops some of whose bodies have still not been recovered from unmarked mass graves.

NATO intervention lasted 78 days and effectively obliterated the Serbian army and Yugoslav state apparatus, bringing dictator Slobodan Milosevic to the negotiating table like Mladic  before him and closing the last chapter of the Yugoslav wars. The coalition countries did suffer any casualties in this campaign.

I ask others to contribute information about the other 4 countries.

Article 15 of the [European Convention for Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights) allows contracting states to derogate from certain rights guaranteed by the Convention in a time of ""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"", under certain conditions:

&gt;* there must be a public emergency threatening the life of the nation;
&gt;* any measures taken in response must be ""strictly required by the exigencies of the situation""; and
&gt;* the measures taken in response to it must be in compliance with a state's other obligations under international law.
&gt;
&gt;In addition to these substantive requirements, the derogation must be procedurally sound. There must be some formal announcement of the derogation and notice of the derogation and any measures adopted under it, and the ending of the derogation must be communicated to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.

According to the G4 Media article, Romania has not met the conditions. The European Council considers that there's no need to opt out of the entire Convention, since Article 11 already allows limiting the right of assembly during a state of emergency. Additionally, Romania has not even specified what rights exactly it intends to ignore and how they would help.

Romanian judges, Europarliamentaries and advocates for human rights have pointed out that it opens the path for summary judgments which have absolutely no recourse as well as other abuse.",Romania 🇷🇴,/r/europe/comments/fnwvas/5_european_countries_have_requested_derogation/flbz1fi/,snuflswasmyslavename,1585015941

5339,"As a Hungarian, I'm really ashamed of this thing, but still, I don't understand all the naive people thinking that EU would tackle this phenomenon.

Viktor Orbán and his allies have built their media/industry empire from EU/German funding. Since their first landslide election win, they have been busy with diverting the EU money to their own pockets, and guess what? Germany, and the other European powers do not bat an eye.

Of course they do not. Since the German automotive companies, the biggest employers in the country, get huge tax benefits, and also access to cheap labor with no worker rights (Dafuq is a trade union? Never heard of it. Strikes? It is illegal to go on strike if it involves the full shutdown of production.).

Of course, with this kind of laws, Hungary managed to lure in a huge part of the German automotive supply chain (for example, 1,8 million Audi engines are manufactured in Hungary, per annum).

The Germans would never topple such a government. 

The EPP, (with its biggest member, the CDU-CSU), has never punished Orbán, even though he crossed multiple ""red lines"" set up by its leaders, such as expelling a liberal university, or giving asylum to the failed pro-Russian, anti-EU prime minister of Macedonia, who was sentenced to jail for corruption in his own country. 

The corruption of the Hungarian elite, such as our billionaire gas fitter or Orbán's personal football stadium repeatedly makes it into the Western European media, yet these governments never hurry to save their taxpayer's money. 

Wonder why? Because the EU money is purposedly used to bribe our corrupt politicians to facilitate the operations of the aforementioned multinational corporations. 

Why are you so naive to believe that Angela Merkel or Manfred Weber would prioritize the state of democracy in Hungary over the short-term economic interests of their own country? 

I used to believe in the EU, but I'm losing faith as they keep pumping shitloads of money into Orbán's war machine. Nobody can expect our opposition to take up the fight against such huge economic and political power! 

Of course, you could say that there is article 7, but everybody knows that it has been a futile attempt from day one. It is more of a PR stunt to appease  the Western citizens who are concerned by the aforementioned problems.

As long as the Audi factory keeps rattling, the EU is  not going to do shit about Orbán.",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/fnftjt/hungary_to_consider_bill_that_would_allow_orbán/flbzo8d/,MiKingKing,1585016371

The EU is actually very active in trying to create a single digital market, but decades of copyright and other legal matters kind of get in the way of doing that quickly. The EU did make it so services like Netflix can't shut you out if you are in another EU country, which they used to do before.

I did not see Netflix pretending it was binding. And other video websites (Youtube being the biggest) also took measures.

But everyone is complaining about something now. Some complain the EU forced Netflix to do this. Other that Netflix just did it to cut costs. Others that the EU should just shut up about it. Now we see people bringing in complaints about a lack of EU single market offering.

The Lombardy is very rich and has very good health care. But at one point they were so much over capacity that they started to stuff people in every room they had. The videos i saw from the situation there it looked like the had up to 6 persons in a room. Let's not forget that Corvid-19 is more dangerous if you get exposed to a higher viral load. So stacking people on each-other could've worsened their chance of survival significantly.

that incubation can be significantly delayed (leaving
more time for the immune system to respond) depending

\~Netflix 2020

&amp;#x200B;

It's funny before Netflix planned on reducing its video quality I had read just a day prior the extreme surge of internet usage and that if it became too bad it could significantly hurt scientist and doctors across the world trying to fight the coronavirus that're sharing data. 

Netflix reduces its image quality and now because of that they're still the bad guys, taking opportunity for profit! 

It's like Amazon not only doubling workers wages immediately but also giving unlimited sick time and health insurance day one which is absolutely unheard of in the US yet to Redditors, Americans in particular 'they're not doing nearly enough, they should be getting paid 10x!' Meanwhile you look around the world at other online retailers to see if they're doubling pay with unlimited sick hours.. crickets. 

These tech companies are cool to hate because they're American and they're giant. If this was some company from Sweden, they'd be praised for it, it'd be like 'why isnt every company in the world doing exactly what they're doing immediately?!?!' 

Edgy. reddit. Hating on Netflix for nothing. They already bowed down to EU pressure to be forced to show X amount of local content and now they're trying to do the right thing here. Even McDonalds is being slammed on Reddit for shutting down  its stores across the UK, people saying they're too cheap to pay employees properly. Meanwhile most food businesses outside of grocers are doing the same exact thing.

1. Electricity is only about 1/5^th of all the energy we utilize

2. Grid-scale storage of electricity can't exist, as per basic physics. Pumped storage by far the most efficient, limited by topography. Possibilities do exist to develop it further, with unfavorable cost/benefit ratio nevertheless, and limited potential anyway.

3. And yes, why, of course, the very limiting factor of massive deployement of wind and solar is *intermittency*. This elephant is standing tall and proud in every room where ""renewable electricity* is mentionned.

In 2018, the primary energy supply to the UK amounted to 177 Mtoe, ie 2.059 million GWh. This order of magnitude is gravely missing in the aforelinked article, which dicusses an homeopathic dose of *less than one in two millions*.

And again and of course, this is even before counting the energy that was used *elsewhere* to provide what is used *here*, typically manufactured imports.

All this hot air around grid-scale electricity  storage is not without merit, though. By entertaining the illusion that mass-storage could be doable, it sustains the flow of investments, and subsidies, toward renewables, and ensures hefty profits for operators.
