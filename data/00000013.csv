63,"&gt;Baltic germans or polish nobility, doesn't matter

Doesn't matter? They are like two totally different cultural influences...

&gt;Estonia and Livonia were gubernias which were under Russian rule, even though the local nobility was not ethnically Russian.

So you comfortably left aside that unlike Lithuania, the three governorates in modern Estonia and Latvia were ruled *autonomously*...

&gt;I have Estonian political family

What is that supposed to mean even?

&gt;Finland was kinda different, the Grand Duchy had a level of autonomy no other part of the Empire had.

So what is the non-arbitrary difference here? Both Finland and Estonia/Latvia were ruled autonomously. The degrees of autonomy were different, but where is the non-arbitrary difference?

&gt;they got lumped with the Scandinavians, even though they're clearly the odd one out.

They're clearly not Scandinavians.

&gt;What are the ignorant stereotypes?

Ignorant assumptions about our history, culture and national identity.

&gt;You ask anybody about stereotypes of Baltic countries and they consist in basically ""cold, ex-USSR, on the south-east Baltic"". All of them are true, all of them are neutral.

Not only. A form of those ignorant stereotypes is also lumping them together in every aspect there is, even though they clearly belong to different cultural regions.

&gt;As for your last comment, say what you want but that's a personal anecdote that I've seen with my own eyes.

He is widely regarded by scholars, engineers, and artists around the world to be one of the greatest minds in history.
&gt;

179,"&gt; Niccol√≤ di Bernardo dei Machiavelli (/Àåm√¶ki…ôÀàv…õli/, also US: /Àåm…ëÀêk-/; Italian: [nikkoÀàl…î mmakjaÀàv…õlli]; 3 May 1469 ‚Äì 21 June 1527) was an Italian diplomat, philosopher, politician, historian and writer who lived during the Renaissance. He is best known for his political treatise The Prince (Il Principe), written about 1513. He has often been called the father of modern political philosophy and political science.
&gt; 
&gt; For many years he served as a senior official in the Florentine Republic with responsibilities in diplomatic and military affairs. He wrote comedies, carnival songs, and poetry. His personal correspondence is of high importance to historians and scholars. He worked as secretary to the Second Chancery of the Republic of Florence from 1498 to 1512, when the Medici were out of power.
&gt; 
&gt; Machiavelli's name came to evoke unscrupulous acts of the sort he advised most famously in The Prince. His experience showed him that politics have always been played with deception, treachery and crime. He also notably said that a ruler who is establishing a kingdom or a republic, and is criticized for his deeds, including violence, should be excused when the intention and the result is beneficial. Machiavelli's Prince was much read as a manuscript long before it was published in 1532 and the reaction was mixed. Some considered it a straightforward description of the evil means used by bad rulers; others read in it evil recommendations to tyrants to help them maintain their power. Many scholars, such as Leo Strauss, stated that Machiavelli was a ""teacher of evil"".
&gt; 
&gt; The term Machiavellian often connotes political deceit, deviousness, and realpolitik. Even though Machiavelli has become most famous for his work on principalities, scholars also give attention to the exhortations in his other works of political philosophy. While much less well known than The Prince, the Discourses on Livy (composed c.‚Äâ1517) is often said to have paved the way of modern republicanism.

198,"&gt;Looks like it bothers you to be lumped with Lithuania in a simple regional grouping of countries.

It doesn't bother me, it's just factually wrong to put together a traditionally Lutheran Finnic country with loads of Germanic influence and a traditionally Catholic Baltic country with more Polish influence.

&gt;Estonia and Lithuania had different administrative status, but they were both under the control of St Petersburg.

That's what you don't understand. The Estonian and Latvian history during that time wasn't that much influenced by the Russian emperors, but by the local Baltic German elites who had wide autonomies in [the governorates of Estonia, Livonia and Courland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_governorates).

&gt;It was much similar situation than Estonia and Finland, to make a comparison.

And that's quite literally incorrect. Finland and Estonia were both under autonomous rule from Russia (Finland under independent autonomy, Estonia under Baltic German autonomy), while Lithuania was not.

&gt;And in any case, the geography (being like a outer ""penninsula"" of the EU), climate, fauna, flora, gastronomy, the similar history in the 20th and 21st century, and the cultural Estonia+Latvia and Latvia+Lithuania, as well as the similar geography and small population (a combined population of around 6 million) these are more than enough reasons to lump the three countries into the same region.

And how many of these arguments don't work for Finland as well? Similar climate, fauna, flora, gastronomy at least, plus the Estonia+Finland cultural connection and a small population. These are more than enough reasons to not exclude Estonia from any cultural region that includes Finland.

&gt;Really I don't understand what all the fuss is about.

Yeah, wonder why locals have a problem with foreigners sticking to ignorant stereotypes...

&gt;And when an Estonian and a Lithuanian meet in Spain (which I've seen) they are all like ""ohh you baltic brother"" and there's an instant recognition of a shared way of thinking and values.

240,"Battle of Trasimene  (June 217 BCE) was the second major battle of the Second Punic War, in which the Carthaginian forces of Hannibal defeated the Roman army under Gaius Flaminius in central Italy. Many of the Roman troops, mainly infantry, were forced into Lake Trasimene (modern Lake Trasimeno), where they drowned or were massacred. The battle proved to Rome that Hannibal was a formidable enemy who was best avoided, a realization that inspired the Fabian strategy of nonengagement.

In early 217 BCE Hannibal marched his army across the Apennines, following the Arno River. The Roman general Gaius Flaminius stationed his legions in Arretium (modern Arezzo) with the intention of stopping Hannibal‚Äôs advance. Flaminius was not a patrician but a populist of the plebeian class, and his ambitions were matched by his arrogance and his desire to sway public opinion in his favour.

Hannibal altered his route into the heart of Etruria by going through the Arno marshes for four days and three nights. Some of his Celt allies became sick in the marshes, and Hannibal himself lost his right eye to an infection in the swamp. Once Hannibal‚Äôs army had recovered from its ordeal, it began to ravage the countryside in an effort to draw the Romans into battle. Had Flaminius been a more-assertive general, he likely could have destroyed Hannibal‚Äôs waterlogged army as it exited the swamp. 

Instead, Hannibal was able to set up an ambush at a place of his choosing. Rather than continuing directly south along the Val di Chiana toward the Tiber River valley and eventually Rome itself, Hannibal waited until he was sure the army of Flaminius had followed him from Arretium. Then, in view of Flaminius, Hannibal‚Äôs army turned abruptly east in the direction of Perusia (modern Perugia), along the narrow north shore of Lake Trasimene, under the hill town of Curtun (modern Cortona). Hannibal timed the maneuver so that Flaminius could see where he had gone just as darkness fell. The Romans camped outside the valley while Hannibal‚Äôs forces took up their carefully planned positions during the night.

In the morning an overeager Flaminius neglected to dispatch advance scouts, and the Romans marched under the hills, where masterful positioning and a heavy fog off Lake Trasimene had concealed elements of Hannibal‚Äôs army. Hannibal‚Äôs African and Iberian veterans were positioned in plain view at the east end of the valley, and his cavalry and Gallic troops were secreted in the heights above. 

Once the Roman advance troops had reached the main body of Hannibal‚Äôs forces and the Roman rear had cleared the mouth of the valley, the ambushers swept down from the hills. The Roman rear guard was massacred by Hannibal‚Äôs cavalry. Thousands of Romans were forced into the lake, where they drowned in heavy armour or were immobilized by mud and cut down by cavalry. 

The unexpected speed of the ambush and poor visibility from the fog prevented the Romans from organizing into proper battle formations, further reducing their combat effectiveness. Some 6,000 Romans in the vanguard managed to force their way east through Hannibal‚Äôs Africans and Iberians but were soon captured by the Carthaginian officer Maharbal. Roman co-consul Gnaeus Servilius Geminus sent a contingent of 4,000 men to reinforce Flaminius from Ariminum (modern Rimini), but Maharbal captured them en route, thus completing the Roman defeat.

Military historian Basil Liddell Hart called the Battle of Trasimene ‚Äúthe greatest ambush in history.‚Äù The Roman losses were at least 15,000 dead, including Flaminius himself, whose possibly decapitated body could not be identified and buried. An additional 15,000 Romans were taken prisoner, whereas Hannibal may have lost only 1,500 soldiers overall in the battle. 

Rome was left bewildered and traumatized, leading some historians to wonder why Hannibal did not then march on the capital. Hannibal no doubt knew the city was stoutly defended, however, and that his small and mobile army was well-suited for marauding but ill-equipped for a protracted siege.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/o4mwji/on_this_day_in_217_bc_during_the_second_punic_war/h2i65ta/,filosoful,1624249506

289,"&gt;‚ÄúIt is not an enviable position to be in, but we are not alone: the US, Japan, the UK, Canada, Australia, India and others are rushing to address this vulnerability as well,‚Äù the commissioner said. ‚ÄúI believe we are in a similar situation with rare earths and permanent magnets as we were a few years ago with batteries and lithium: Total dependence on China, very limited EU production, no European regulation to encourage ethical sourcing of rare earths, create demand for recycled materials or give a competitive advantage to European manufacturers through carbon footprint requirements, and downstream industries which benefit from the current situation in terms of cost/benefit ratio.‚Äù

I'd suggest that it's less critical to avoid sourcing from China so much as it is to avoid being in a position where one cannot transition away without major issues.

I think China will have serious issues with their economic growth in the near future (could make the nation unstable and population angry about their stagnating situation, which the CCP fears the most). They have a rapidly aging population, they are hostile towards any immigration. Same as Japan, but I don't think China will reach their development. The West will slowly turn its back against them the more they will see it as a threat. Their belt &amp; road plan in CEE Europe already failed miserably. They will try to snatch up some African countries to their side and make them their new cheap suppliers of goods though. Not sure if China will try to attack Taiwan. Taiwan is getting close to Japan and they are cooperating militarily. Same with the US.

Russia might pull some bullshit here and there, try hijack elections in some European countries, but I don't think much more will change. (There aren't any other good targets to invade anymore) The stability of Russia depends on how long Putin will live and how well he'll prepare his succession. Anything can happen after that really. They could become a major player in the Arctic Sea as the ice will melt and the north warm up. (Good potential sea trade routes). This could mean Russia would have a big advantage in the world in the future.

I think USA will continue to be the world's superpower in the near future. They are a massive hub of skilled immigration, steady population growth and good rising economy. Though they might cause another economic crisis soon (I hope not)

393,"European comedy is alot more tragedy based that american, o sometimes forget that it doesn't translate.

So let me clarify, i don't find it funny that children are being shot, I'm not a psychopath, however one way of dealing with that reality is to in speech (making sure not to be specific about names of people or schools) making it seem unimportant for the duration of the sentence you utter.

Same reason for poles and Jews to tell holocaust jokes, or African-frenchmen making slavery jokes, or anyone making those jokes. Because anyone has the right to any jokes, my people where slaves for 280 years or so, i make jokes of it constantly, and anyone should be allowed to. The point isn't to invalidate the pain behind any event, it's kind of similar to gallows humor, where you kinda just have to get around being outwardly depressed using extreme wording within any jokes, and using those themes for unimportant discussions. There is a difference in culture of comedy on either side of the Atlantic ocean.

For example if you look at European comedy shows (i will use English ones so you can fact check me) we have shows such as inbetweeners, red dwarf and Frasier, all of them are about the misfortune of it's main characters, they are quite depressing if you take them at face value, but you're not supposed to. While american shows such as friends, cheers and how I met your mother, have sort of an optimistic view where the characters always end up in a good or better place after every story arc.",,/r/europe/comments/o3ygq1/pastas_in_italy/h2hx8cg/,SheepishBlacksmith,1624244026

Basically this cuts into the core of ethnogenesis, because those very tribes at the beginning, since they lived in a fertile land with tons of resources around (talking abou Subsaharan Africa), they got lazy and didn't focus a lot of improving themselves, which made them weak, and easily conquerable by europeans that came from harsher climates and tons of wars to select powerful empires from. No wonder civilization begun from Mesopotamia, from the middle of the desert with just a few rivers nearby, those people had to adapt, and trade with whomever in order to survive and prosper, they didn't jump in the middle of garden of eden and have everything provided for them. Russia could be the richest and most powerful country on the planet who could easily outdominate everyone else, yet they barely can sustain themselves and almost had their asses kicked in WW2, their only salvation was that their tank production kicked in fast and then their numerical and resource superiority outdominated the Nazis, but by quality, the Nazi army was much better organized and of high quality (this of course is not an endorsement of them obviously). And Russia really didn't had any strong enemies to confront before, so we are not comparing ravaged countries from Africa but relatively stable countries that had all the opportunities in the world to become powerful, but they didn't. And today its even more ridiculous becuase they have lost even the industrial might they had in the Soviet times. Today Russia is in no danger of invasion or any large scale military attack, yet it still can't utilize it's resources properly, and have even wasted the industry that their ancestors hadly built up.

476,"The Delta coronavirus variant that swept the UK has become dominant in Portugal and appeared in clusters across Germany, France and Spain, prompting European health officials to warn further action is needed to slow its spread.¬†

While the new strain, which first emerged in India, still only accounts for a fraction of the total coronavirus cases in mainland Europe, it is gaining ground, according to a Financial Times analysis of global genomic data from the virus tracking database Gisaid. It accounts for 96 per cent of sequenced Covid-19 infections in Portugal, more than 20 per cent in Italy and about 16 per cent in Belgium, the FT‚Äôs calculations show.

The small but rising number of cases have raised concerns that the Delta variant could halt the progress the EU has made over past the two months in bringing new infections and deaths down to their lowest level since¬†at least¬†the autumn.¬†

‚ÄúWe are in the process of crushing the virus and crushing the pandemic, and we must in no way let the Delta variant get the upper hand,‚Äù France‚Äôs health minister, Olivier V√©ran, told reporters at a Paris vaccination centre on Tuesday.¬†

V√©ran said that 2 per cent to 4 per cent of virus samples being analysed in France were showing as the Delta variant: ‚ÄúYou might say this is still low but it is similar to the situation in the UK a few weeks ago.‚Äù The FT‚Äôs analysis of Gisaid‚Äôs data suggests this figure could be higher.

In Portugal, community transmission of the variant has been detected in the greater Lisbon area, where more than 60 per cent of the country‚Äôs new coronavirus cases in the past week have been identified. Non-essential travel to and from the city has been banned this weekend in an effort to prevent the spike in cases spreading to the rest of the country.

Scientists across the continent are now looking to the UK ‚Äî where Covid-19 cases have tripled in the past month and the Delta variant accounts for about 98 per cent of all new infections ‚Äî for clues about what may happen next and which measures may need to be taken.
After official data showed the Delta variant appeared to increase the risk of hospitalisation by 2.2 times compared with the Alpha variant, the UK government this week imposed a one month delay to the removal of its remaining coronavirus restrictions.
‚ÄúThe decisions the UK makes to reopen life and society will serve as a laboratory for us in Europe,‚Äù said Bruno Lina, a virologist in Lyon who advises the French government and helps co-ordinate variant sequencing in the country.

Whether the clusters of Delta infections peppering the EU turn into bigger outbreaks will depend in part on how many people have been fully vaccinated, scientists said, as well as people‚Äôs behaviour now that many restrictions on life and business are being lifted.

Recent UK government research has highlighted the need to complete vaccination programmes as quickly as possible. According to¬†data gathered by Public Health England, the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine is generally less effective against the Delta variant than with the previous strains. Two doses increases protection against symptomatic infection with Delta from 33 per cent to 81 per cent.¬†

While in the UK about 46 per cent of the population has been fully immunised, vaccination rates in most countries in mainland Europe are hovering at between 20 per cent and 30 per cent.¬†About 26 per cent of the population in France has been fully vaccinated.
French authorities are currently trying to contain an outbreak in the Landes region, near the Spanish border, where 125 cases of the Delta variant have been confirmed by¬†genetic sequencing and another 130 are suspected, representing about 30 per cent of recent infections in the area. Clusters of the Delta variant have also been identified in recent weeks in the southern suburbs of Paris and an art school in Strasbourg.¬†
In each case health officials have responded with the same formula: increased contact tracing and a renewed push to vaccinate people in the affected areas.
‚ÄúIf we keep vaccination going at a good pace, and some non-pharmaceutical interventions like masks indoors, we can still repress the circulation of the virus this summer,‚Äù said Lina, the French virologist. ‚ÄúThis variant will displace the other ones ‚Äî we must keep that in mind ‚Äî but it doesn‚Äôt mean that it will lead to a new epidemic wave.‚Äù

Some scientists fear the Delta variant may have already spread further but gone undetected given that less of the genomic sequencing needed to identify variants has been completed in mainland Europe. While the UK has sequenced more than 500,000 Sars-Cov-2 genomes, Germany, France and Spain have sequenced about 130,000, 47,000 and 34,000 respectively.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs costly, it‚Äôs time consuming and it was neglected,‚Äù said Antoine Flahault, director of the Institute of Global Health at the University of Geneva.

Denmark, however, has sequenced a high proportion of cases and still only identified a small number of Delta infections, even though the variant arrived in the country at approximately the same time as in the UK.
This could be explained partly, experts said, by differences in demographics and movement, including the number of cases imported into the country from regions with a high prevalence, such as India, and the living conditions in the communities into which it is seeded.

The difference in the pace of Delta‚Äôs spread across European countries remained ‚Äúa little bit of a mystery‚Äù, said Jeff Barrett, director of the Covid-19 Genomics Initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge.

Still, many experts believe that wherever the Delta variant is introduced, it will eventually become dominant. The key, they say, will be to increase the proportion of fully vaccinated people, while slowing transmission of the virus as much as possible.
‚ÄúWe have to keep the messaging very clear,‚Äù said Lina in Lyon. ‚ÄúThis is not over.‚Äù",,/r/europe/comments/o4iotr/delta_variant_begins_to_spread_threatening_eus/h2hgera/,Ok-Pace-8608,1624234754

504,"Ok Ima take my time to try to explain you, Im not tryna be rude or something but correcting me making this assumption was really offensive.

So yeah basically Haiti and Guadeloupe were both colonized by the French, along with some other islands (Saint-Barth√©l√©my, Martinique and Saint-Martin, where France still shares a border with the Netherlands today). Actually there would be a lot to tell about that, Guadeloupe have also been colonized by the Spanish, the Brits and even the Swedish. All these islands were slave colonies until the abolition of slavery in 1848 in France, except for Haiti who declared independence in 1804 after defeating the French army. 

After 1848 Guadeloupe remained a colony. France needed workers there so there‚Äôs been a few waves of immigration. First there were Africans, then Indians (who had a lot of influence on the local culture : food, clothes, etc.), and then came a few Chinese and South Asians. Guadeloupeans have since then always more or less wanted more integration to the French Republic. Some of them even fought with the French during WWI and WWII. In 1946, Guadeloupe and Martinique became ¬´¬†d√©partements¬†¬ª, which means that they were no longer colonies (like Morocco, S√©n√©gal or Cambodia for example) but French territories with the same status as for example Paris. Today these territories are still fully integrated French regions and they are even part of the European Union. 

There is really a lot to say about Guadeloupe, Martinique or even Guyane, R√©union, Mayotte‚Ä¶ and even though there is still a difference of treatment for these places, even though the colonial past still has heavy consequences there, things are getting better and the quality of life is way superior compared to what you have in other places in the region.

Voil√†, hope this helps.

This is often thrown around but makes no sense, the ROC makes more claims than the PRC. For instance the border dispute between the PRC and Mongolia has been settled as early as 1964 and the ROC has never renounced to its claim there or accept the PRC resolution.

The ROC is also not just sitting and watching their claims but actively trying to enforce them:

Southern states in the US built their entire economy on slavery, and fused it into a religious right to own these subhuman, humans. The entire Southern Culture was based on the inferiority of Negros. Unrelated to the human history of enslaving conquered peoples, or selling family members into slavery. Almost a religious tenet that Negros were murderous liars and thieves that deserved to be enslaved, due to their supposed ancestors from after the Biblical flood.. Making them free, which destroyed their economy just concentrated their righteous wrath and need to continue their lords work in harassing and abusing them, and it infected the rest of the country, a country of immigration, and resentment by the old immigrants of the new immigrants, all.fighting for an opportunity to climb from the bottom. Like the anti Chinese laws, and anti Irish laws. Disparaging of Italians.

And also on the backs of the indigenous peoples. Tied to religious virtue, almost obligation. 

And it continues. As many forget, President Lincoln, and others thought American Negros should be repatriated to their African origins, as it was felt that there could be no end to almost 200 years of dehumanizing Negros, √†nd he was worried about retribution by Negros.

I can't contemplate ketchup on pasta anymore. I was in cooking class in secondary school (say like 12 years old) and decided to make Angel Hair pasta (cappelini) with pancetta for a dish. Brought the extra back in a tupperware container, and shoved the (still quite warm) leftovers in the fridge. Got hungry the next day, so decided to warm it up in the microwave. Bit dry, so I squirted a couple of tablespoons of ketchup into the pot and chowed down. Wasn't long before I had the worst case of vomiting in my life (only ever exceeded by a house party 6 years later where I drank around 25 units to take my mind off relationship issues).

I mean the Mongols conquered half of the known world because they could. Practically every country, civilization, culture conquered its neighbors if they could. Europeans weren't worse than others in that regard. It's simply that they were increasingly stronger from the Renaissance to the modern period, so they could do it.

Eventually, it's European civilization which developed principles of human rights and the abolition of slavery, free thought, equality and whatnot. Something no other conquering civilization had done before, to that extent. That's why still today Western countries are clearly the most tolerant and open minded, free societies out there.

Couldn't agree more!

&gt;They campaign for their own visibility and in these events are exhibitionists first and LGBT second. Sexual fetishes don't belong to a public event (LGBT or straight) unless it's a specific event for that and has an 18+ age entry requirement.

Exactly. For example there's Folsom Street Fair in San Francisco about the BDSM and many people are completely naked there and doing very nasty things.

814,"\&gt;No, not really, contemporaries weren't referring to Ottoman Empire as &gt;""Ottomans"", but as Turks, hence ""Turkish abductions"", ""Great Turkish War"" etc.  


They were wrong back then, they are wrong now.  Saying Turks did it is better for propoganda purposes than, a Dutch captain with his Barbary crew did it. 

  
\&gt;Even if Ottoman Turks ruled over many other nations, the Turks were the core &gt;and backbone of the state. Go trough historical sources and count which name &gt;will be more common, Turk or Ottoman?

No they weren't. Turkish language was though since it is the language of the ruling family. Again Europeans needed an identity as their enemies. Since the ruling family was speaking Turkish, it was chosen.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;What's with the erasure of ethnicity in this thread? The unification of countries &gt;such as Italy or Germany didn't create their ethnicity out of thin air. Those &gt;people were closely related by blood, culture, language and that's why those &gt;nation states were created. They were living in different states before that &gt;because of political circumstances, not because they were different peoples 

Just the opposite some political or military force occupied lands and pushed the identity of that nation. Without Bismarck, Bavarians would be  a different nation like Austrians or German speaking Cantons of Switzerland. For example Bretons, Basques, Corsicans are nations  under French occupation.

But, most of the restaurants where I live, in Minneapolis, are very nice. I have authentic cuisine available near me from like a hundred different nationalities.

I can get a french Mexican fusion burrito for like ten bucks, and it's fantastic. That's in a food truck two blocks from my apartment. 

Obviously it varies as to how good some food is compared to other 'authentic' places, but it's there. Andiamo is a restaurant that is like 45 minutes south of me and is the best Italian food I've ever had, but I've never been to Italy. So I know it doesn't compare.

The legend goes that the inventor made it for his pregnant wife to try to get as many calories in her as possible when she wasn‚Äôt eating much. However it was never popular until he began serving it at a restaurant that was on the main tourist walk in Rome. 

After World War I, virtually every tourist center in Europe was trying to cater to wealthy Americans. Chef Alfredo hit the jackpot when Doug Pickford and Mary Pickford went there on their honeymoon (they were THE Hollywood couple, basically the 1920 equivalent of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) and proclaimed it their favorite ‚ÄúItalian‚Äù dish. 

Suddenly this weird monstrosity of a pasta dish was extremely popular with all of high society in the US. Cheap imitations spawned all over the US serving the middle classes, but the original was made with real churned butter and imported Parmesan Reggiano and served for high prices in New York. After a few years of being the number one dish in the US it permanently became cemented in the American consciousness as the quintessential Italian pasta dish.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/o3ygq1/pastas_in_italy/h2fhiyb/,Donkey__Balls,1624198223

1098,"&gt;Shame it can't sell the fish, though.

It can sell its fish though, not quite on the same basis (and there are issues fir things like shellfish), but the UK has a domestic market and non-EU export partners. Fishermen will need some support, but the outcome is UK control over the UK's waters.

&gt;We're hiring more customs officers too, but that's a broken windows fallacy. Smashing windows provides more work for windows repairers, and increases the glass industry revenue, but that doesnt make it beneficial for the economy.

The aim was to disentangle the UK from an EU political project people didn't like though. The argument wasn't that leaving the EU would mean better access to the EU market than EU membership.

&gt;The UK replacement for CAP is apparently not even remotely close to CAP, and the UK-AUS FTA will probably kill off the small scale beef farms

It's supposedly quite different in its aims, which is not surprising given the issues the UK had with CAP.. And the UK-AUS FTA will almost certainly not kill off small scale farms, the TCA with the EU almost certainly puts more pressure UK farming..

&gt;It has temporary FTAs that temporarily grant the same conditions as under EU (so why bother leaving), until a new FTA frame can be negotiated. None of those placeholders provide better conditions than the UK had under the EU.

It has managed to negotiate the same level of access as it had within the EU, with the opportunity to further tailor FTA's to the benefif of the UK and its trade partners. If it can do that outside of the EU, why bother locking itself into a political project too?

&gt;The UK-AUS deal was already very much to the benefit of Australia. But that deal hasn't been signed yet.

As far as I am aware it is very much mutually beneficial.

&gt;And UK lost the FTA it had with it's main trading partner, and replaced it with something that according to UK, isn't working.

The TCA seems to be working, the WA and NIP seem to need tweaking. Either way the UK and EU seem to have a working trade agreement in place with some issues in a very complex area.

&gt;True, but it won't receive the rebate nor the benefits. ""Not having to pay the budget"" isn't an advantage, that's a mechanical consequence of Brexit. Leave has yet to prove that the end sum is beneficial

Not receiving the rebate nor the benefits is the point, we aren't in the EU any more...

&gt;...except for Switzerland and Turkey. For some sectors Israel and Canada have better access than the UK because of their MRA's. Unless you are referring to Northern Ireland.

It's somewhat debatable, Turkey is in arguably in a shitter position with EU trade, Switzerland was in a better one but seems to be running that down, Canada doesn't have better access, and has issues with EU member states essentially violating the CETA anyway.

&gt;Look, I understand the sovereignty bit, and the part about ""we don't like where the EU is headed"". Nobody needs to stay on a train they don't like. But the economic consequences of Brexit will always be a price to pay. Claiming Brexit will benefit sovereignty AND the economy, that was the big deceit.

And I'm not claiming that it will lead to an immediate economic benefit (there is a possibility longer term depending on commercial and regulatory approaches domestically), but the impact also hasn't been anything like the disaster that some people projected to the point that most people haven't noticed.  It's not really a massive economic hit when the impact is negligible.   And yes, some sectors face larger challenges, but it would seem that there is some benefit to workers from that, and the sectors that have relied on cheap labour will have to invest in productivity, those that are suffering because of market access issues will have to adapt.

After Trump's combative policies and aversion of alliances,the American-led world order has been highly imperfect. EU confronted series of losses in covid-19 pandemic, including lives, jobs. We will not forget the pain experienced by the citizens of Italy, Spain, France etc. Actual response of our allies are inconsistent and self-centered. Thus, it's good for EU to boost strategic autonomy. 

Now Under Biden, US act as the savior of the world again! Some EU countries try to maintaining a sort of dogmatic relation with the US again. And this create an obstacle to further EU cooperation.But the goal of American strategy is to prevent power of the region from turning on United States. 

EU needs to do what's good for Europe not what's good for US. I like this draft's take and it should have been in the public version. Strategic autonomy doesn't mean worse relations.

1405,"&gt;Random guesses are listed. Norwegians and Swedes don't agree to those facts.

They don't agree to facts about Estonian culture? Isn't that kind of dumb and perhaps even xenophobic?

&gt;...Yes?

That's just plain stupid..

&gt;If you were so close for so long, then surely those people would know about it?

Because the Soviet occupation absolutely didn't affect what foreigners know about us?

&gt;Samogitian was heavily influenced by Curonian, because it was in the same area.

So loans, not substrata.

&gt;Who are those people, why is their opinion important?

That's not how it works. We have been over this. Why are you acting like a child?

&gt;Your teenage Estonian friends aren't a reliable source, their opinion doesn't matter.

*No* person is a source ffs, facts are the source...

&gt;Why?

Do you think there is some Norwegian site which talks about Finnish culture and compares it to Scandinavian countries?

&gt;It's literally just some Estonian teens who think that Estonia is Nordic.

How would you know that? Why teens specifically? You are acting like a ridiculous child here yourself if you think that centuries of Nordic identity in Estonia is only just some modern teen talk... Like where are you even getting this? You are so convinced of your stereotypes, yet have literally zero facts to support them with. I have given you countless examples of how Estonian culture and identity is Nordic, yet you dismiss them because of course they must be Estonian propaganda or whatnot. 

What happened to you? Are you really so ashamed of your poorly developed home country that you cannot fathom that a country with a similar recent history doesn't identity with you? Isn't that kind of pathetic? You won't change how Estonians identify, why bother? You won't change what Estonian culture is like, why push a certain non-factual narrative?

&gt;Nobody outside of Estonia agrees with them. 

Definitely not nobody, that's just a dumb exaggeration. And most people don't agree because they lack knowledge about Estonia and have negative stereotypes about it due to the Soviet occupation, so they deny all factual comparisons of our cultures.

&gt;You have to actually be Nordic to be Nordic.

Thank you for agreeing with me! That's exactly who we are!

&gt;Estonia cannot into Nordic.

First, I disagree (see below). Second, PO is no longer major force of opposition or possible winner of next elections. 

&gt; PO was quite pro-Russia until 2014

Wrong take. They weren't anti-Russia, during period when Russia didn't go anti-EU yet. Ukraine changed everything and led to open Brussels-Moscow rivalry. That's same, as PiS making relations with Lukashenka better (before 2020), even debating closing Belsat at some moment.

Remember that PO was at the same time clearly pro-EU, but also pro-NATO/USA - it's them who organised major meeting in 2016, and secured presence of US forces (small but still). Foreign policy was probably the only thing they did well.

&gt; Meanwhile PiS was hostile to Russia long before the Russia-Georgia conflict.

1524,"&gt;Sure, but they are illegal migrants either way. This means that the islands will get buried under people for a while, then express check points will be build to check their status in a matter of hours and then send them back... you saw what happened when Erdogan attempted to play refugee games, the Greeks protected their border with armed forces.

I don't think you understand how does laws work. They are not Turkish citizens you literally can't ""send them back"". Turkey has to accept them. Otherwise you have to kill them or something. There is no other way to get rid of them.

Also Erdogan didn't tried anything he just ""said"" things and thousands of refugees rushed into borders :) He didn't forced or didn't even cut any monetary support that Syrians are getting from Turkey. Which %70 percent of them are getting that in Turkey. IF the state wanted them gone THEY WOULD be gone. I can assure you that much. But Erdogan doesn't want them gone because that gives him his only card on his hand against Europe. That was one of the reasons why he probably did that deal anyway while knowing that it was gonna cost him huge part of his voter base. Which now he have to make a coalition to win elections. He didn't used to need that. Which he used to had like %50 of the votes while now is less then %40 percent (and dropping vert fast his coalition looks like can't even reach the %50 percent anymore which he won with %52 last time), so that decision costed him a LOT but he probably got money under the table as I said and also got something on his hand that can be used against EU if he need it. A short term win-win for him, A lose-lose for Turkish people and still a win for EU as well.

TL;DR He doesn't want them gone.

&gt;All of this would cause a diplomatic crisis of untold proportions and so on and on... definitely not a solution.

it's a risk-reward thing for Turkey, I mean Turkey can't go any lower then this anyway. It would be a bigger problem for EU. And chaos in Europe means uncertainty which means less investment to there, that means more investment to Turkey which is more profitable but less stable, stability is the only card Europe has in his hands when it comes to investments. The amount of unrest, riots etc. would change everything. Just like half a million of them were enough to cause a huge hike in far right in EU now think about 4 million ? also another 3-4 million from Syria that currently under Turkish protected zones that would also become refugees the moment Turkey leave Syria and Assad takes over.

in other word Turkey has a LOT of card in his deck after Erdogan. it's Erdogan that got stuck with his Erdocentric policies not Turkey.

&gt;I hope the next Turkish government will not resort to political circus like what Erdogan is doing and instead seriously work with the EU to actually solve the issue - the Turkish military can stabilize the region with EU member state support and the EU can provide the investment needed to rebuild and get people back into a functioning society. Again this is very straight forward, for the cost of a few hundred thousand refugees in the EU, we can employ millions of people in Syria.

Another Eurocentric view. Why do you think that Turks are willing to die for Europeans and Arabs ? VAST majority of Turks want Turkish soldiers OUT OF MIDDLE EAST. Not the other way around. 

To be honest... Me, my family all my friends are so fed up with the refugee policies of Erdogan. When we talk politics we always say ""jokingly"" we gonna vote for whoever has more anti-refugee rhetoric. 

You can't even understand how much people fed up with this in Turkey. if you start discussing the refugee issue people even say that; they don't mind sanction's from Europe if that means refugee will be gone.

And then add that the fact the no one in Turkey trusts Europe.

1530,"&gt;Also, let me correct the author of the article since he made a mistake, the EU isn't the reason why there hasn't been wars in Europe (even though there definitely were) past WW2, it's because of NATO.

Man this strawman is ridiculous...

1. The author does not directly state that the EU is the sole reason why there haven't beenwars in Europe, it literally specifies **possibility -** ""to prevent the **possibility** of another war"".
2. Schuman died 30 years before the EU came to be.
3. The obvious point is: European economic unification making war so costly that it becomes unthinkable, the euro by itself has made war between France and Germany completely impossible, it would be an act of self destruction for any of the two to attempt it.
4. and so on and on...

And no, NATO is not the reason for peace in Europe.

1. We literally have NATO members being at the brink of war over some empty sea.
2. There is no guarantee NATO will last.
3. The US military industrial complex has proven itself to be a **very** destabilizing force interested in war profiteering over everything else.
4. It is not the US's job to police our continent
5. NATO does next to nothing to stop toxic politics, hate, resentment, exploitation, isolation, propaganda etc. between European countries, without a unifying factor those factors by themselves will lead to conflict. Brexit is a prime example, we are all NATO allies, but the toxic politics and propaganda have been absolutely staggering and its only been a few months

1533,"&gt;International law states that people in danger can flee to the first safe country. Turkey is such a safe country. She states that they are no longer refugees, however that makes them even less capable of entering the EU.

The thing that you don't understand Turkey didn't gave them refugee status. That's a LEGAL STATUS. That gives them some specific rights etc. Turkey gave them ""temporary protection"" status. So they actually CAN claim refugee status in EU the moment they set foot in there.

&gt;When they reach EU shores they can pretend they lost their papers and they somehow came straight from Syria and not from Turkey (even this doesn't work anymore), but if they are not even refugees ie Syria can be recognized as a safe place even this is not possible.

They don't need to pretend they lost their papers. They don't have refugee status like I said. I mean EU actually CAN designate Syria as a safe place and refuse the refugee status of those people and fly or ship them back to Syria. But they can't send them back to Turkey.

There's just been no solution anywhere in the world of removing the damage to drinking culture caused by prohibition. Especially since post-prohibition it's still a very controlled substance, with very high tax rates and a single source state-owned monopoly of sales.

That also twists the motives of the state-owned monopoly sales, just like our thoroughly corrupt monopoly company of betting, lottery and cash-operated casino machines; they're everywhere, advertised and pushed down the throat of people, specifically aimed at addicts.

The alcohol addicts get social security money and then go waste it all on the overtaxed alcohol, then go back to beg for money social security money.

1867,"&gt;You can't annex and occupy at the same time.

If that annexation is illegitimate you can.

&gt;The Baltic states were first occupied and then annexed.

And that annexation was illegitimate, therefore legally the occupation continued.

&gt;My whole point from the beginning. 

A shitty and stereotypical point.

&gt;The countries effectively seized to exist

Yes, they were occupied...

&gt;Whether someone liked it or not, they were fully a part of it.

Not legally.

&gt;Now the US, EU and the Baltic states claim they were never annexed

No, essentially everyone but Russia claims that.

&gt;but occupied in order to claim the continuity which de facto didn't exist.

Continuity existed in other forms, in diplomatic corps abroad for example.

&gt;The Baltic states became independent again in the 90s

Yes, they restored their occupation based on legal continuity.

&gt;but it's ludicrous to claim they were never a part of the Soviet Union.

1888,"This is a way to bypass automatic anti-hate filters.

https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/1488

1488 is a combination of two popular white supremacist numeric symbols. The first symbol is 14, which is shorthand for the ""14 Words"" slogan: ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."" The second is 88, which stands for ""Heil Hitler"" (H being the 8th letter of the alphabet). Together, the numbers form a general endorsement of white supremacy and its beliefs. As such, they are ubiquitous within the white supremacist movement - as graffiti, in graphics and tattoos, even in screen names and e-mail addresses, such as aryanprincess1488@hate.net.  Some white supremacists will even price racist merchandise, such as t-shirts or compact discs, for $14.88.

The symbol is most commonly written as 1488 or 14/88, but variations such as 14-88 or 8814 are also common.

I read another explanation as 1 stand for A (as for Adolf) as  first letter of alphabet, 4 stands for April as month of his birth, and last 8 as for H ( as for Hitler) as eight letter of alphabet. I do not remember for what was the third digit, probably as mentioned on website I put above as ''Heil''.",,/r/europe/comments/o3f51f/merkel_marks_80_years_since_nazi_invasion_of/h2cwvv2/,Writing_Salt,1624134333

**Wielding Twitter, Europe‚Äôs ‚ÄòMarshal Twito‚Äô Takes Aim at the Media**


*Prime Minister Janez Jansa of Slovenia, which will take on the European Union‚Äôs rotating presidency next month, is using what press freedom groups call ‚ÄòTrumpian‚Äô tactics.*

JUBLJANA, Slovenia ‚Äî In Moscow for a conference, the Slovenian magazine editor followed a path well-trodden by foreign visitors. At a flea market piled with kitsch memorabilia, he had his picture taken wearing a Soviet military hat decorated with a red star.

Eight years later, that picture has become a weapon ‚Äî part of a conspiracy theory pushed by Slovenia‚Äôs right-wing government, which vilifies critics in the media as traitorous leftists intent on dragging the country back to communist dictatorship.

The ‚ÄúTrumpian-style tactics,‚Äù as six European press freedom groups recently described them, of Slovenia‚Äôs prime minister, Janez Jansa, would not normally arouse much concern beyond the borders of a small Balkan nation with a population of just two million.

But they are now under intense scrutiny by those looking for signs of what to expect when Mr. Jansa‚Äôs country takes over the European Union‚Äôs rotating presidency next month.

The presidency involves mostly dry bureaucratic business, but it sets the agenda of a bloc with nearly 450 million people. Mr. Jansa‚Äôs views are closely aligned with proudly illiberal governments in Hungary and Poland, which also stand accused of undermining critical media and promoting wild conspiracy theories.

With Slovenia holding the reins in Brussels through December, efforts to get leaders like Prime Minister Victor Orban of Hungary to respect media freedom and other principles on which the union was founded could falter further.

Grega Repovz, the Slovenian editor photographed in the Soviet hat, said he and many colleagues had been smeared by Mr. Jansa and his lieutenants ‚Äúso many times that we don‚Äôt really care and try to laugh.‚Äù 

But he was taken aback recently when he saw his Moscow tourist photograph featured during a European Parliament debate on the state of press freedom in Slovenia.

Mr. Jansa appeared by video link from Ljubljana, the Slovenian capital, and used the photograph as a screen backdrop, along with pictures of other journalists in red T-shirts and holding red flags.

‚ÄúHow can I explain to someone sitting in Brussels that I am not a crazy communist?‚Äù asked Mr. Repovz, the chief editor of Mladina, a magazine that was instrumental in undermining Communist rule in Yugoslavia, of which Slovenia was then a part, in the 1980s.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how you fight lies like this,‚Äù he said.

How to respond to Mr. Jansa has become a headache for others, too.

When the Council of Europe released a report complaining about the ‚Äútoxic and hostile environment‚Äù for Slovenian journalists and a ‚Äústriking deterioration in media freedom,‚Äù Mr. Jansa denounced its author, Europe‚Äôs human rights commissioner, as ‚Äúpart of #fakenews network. Well paid by our money.‚Äù

An early adopter of Twitter ‚Äî Mr. Jansa started using it as a political cudgel years before Donald J. Trump did ‚Äî the prime minister is known to his critics as ‚ÄúMarshal Twito,‚Äù a reference to Marshal Josip Broz Tito, Yugoslavia‚Äôs longtime dictator.

With Mr. Trump now banned from Twitter, Mr. Jansa has taken his place, albeit with far fewer followers, in setting the benchmark for intemperate social media messaging by a national leader.

Even political allies have been aghast at his insults, threats and wild statements, like his tweet after the U.S. presidential election saying, ‚Äúit‚Äôs pretty clear that the American people have elected Donald Trump.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was obviously not a good idea,‚Äù said Lojze Peterle, a former Slovenian prime minister whose center-right party is in Mr. Jansa‚Äôs coalition government.

Mr. Jansa tweeted that the Slovenian News Agency, known as STA, is a ‚Äúnational disgrace‚Äù because it published an interview with a rapper known as Zlatko that was longer than a report about Mr. Jansa meeting Mr. Orban to kick off construction of a power transmission line.

Mr. Jansa‚Äôs government has since suspended funding for the agency, the country‚Äôs principal provider of local and national news, forcing it to rely on crowdfunding to keep going.

There has been bad blood for years between the news agency‚Äôs director, Bojan Veselinovic, and Mr. Jansa, who has denounced him as a ‚Äúpolitical tool of the far left.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the STA is going through and the government‚Äôs attitude to it are unprecedented,‚Äù Mr. Veselinovic said. The government, he added, wants to turn the news agency into a ‚Äúbullhorn for the prime minister.‚Äù

Also cut off this year from modest government funds have been Mladina, the magazine edited by Mr. Repovz and where Mr. Jansa worked as a commentator in the 1980s, and Radio Student, an iconic fixture of the alternative media scene since the 1960s.


A conservative Catholic radio station and a bombastic, barely watched far-right television station run by Mr. Jansa‚Äôs allies did receive funds.

Ursula Menih Dokl, the director general of the culture ministry‚Äôs Media Directorate, denied using funding to squeeze critical outlets, but said the media had long been skewed in favor of the left. Many left-leaning outlets, she added, still get government money.

‚ÄúWith small steps like this we will lay the foundation for a more plural media landscape,‚Äù she said of the ministry‚Äôs funding decisions.

A ministry-commissioned study by Media Faculty, a journalism school in Ljubljana, found no evidence that critical media had been muzzled, concluding that most outlets ‚Äútreat the government markedly less favorably than they do the opposition.‚Äù

Radio Student probably hurt its chances of getting government money by issuing a tweet last year urging ‚Äúdeath to Jans-ism,‚Äù a play on a wartime cry of communist partisans fighting the Nazis in Yugoslavia.

Vid Bester, the editor of Radio Student‚Äôs cultural programming, conceded that ‚Äúwe are quite left-wing‚Äù but said the station had long enriched Slovenia.

‚ÄúIf they really want to promote pluralism in the media space, there is no better place to do this than Radio Student,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúInstead, they went for this brutal hatchet job.‚Äù

Mr. Jansa, an enthusiastic member of the Yugoslav communist party in his youth, has made no secret of his distaste for critical media.

In an essay he wrote and posted on the government‚Äôs website in November, he proclaimed that a ‚Äúwar against the media‚Äù would ‚Äúbe more than welcome.‚Äù

Mr. Jansa and his supporters insist that complaints about threats to media freedom have been ginned up by humorless leftist political enemies.

‚ÄúHe is a passionate person who says things on Twitter,‚Äù said Mitja Irsic, a culture ministry official. ‚ÄúBut there is a difference between saying something stupid on the internet and executing it in real life.‚Äù

Marko Milosavljevic, professor of journalism at Ljubljana University and an outspoken critic of Mr. Jansa, said threats to the media go far beyond Twitter insults. 

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt see the media as a watchdog, only as a Chihuahua that gets thrown little bones and runs around with them,‚Äù he said.

Particularly worrying, he added, are signs that Slovenia‚Äôs most popular television channel, Pop TV, has been pressured to curb critical coverage of the government since its Czech owner, Petr Kellner, met with Mr. Jansa in Ljubljana in December.

Mr. Kellner died three months later in a helicopter crash in Alaska, but his Czech company has since ordered news program editors to send translations of their bulletins to Prague each day so that management can watch out for anything that might upset Mr. Jansa.

The prime minister added his own note of menace in May with a tweet that featured a short video of a fearsome black panther and a message to Pop TV that ‚ÄúI am across the corner.‚Äù

Bernard Nezmah, a sociology professor and a Jansa-supporting columnist for Mladina, acknowledged that the prime minister had tried to intimidate critical media voices, but added that ‚Äúhis intimidation does not work. None of the media that gets attacked by Jansa has changed its attitude.‚Äù

He noted that the country‚Äôs three main daily newspapers and its two most watched television stations, Pop TV and a public broadcaster, still regularly criticize the authorities. 

Media watchdogs, however, believe there is cause for alarm, especially with Slovenia about to take over the E.U. presidency.

The International Press Institute, Reporters Without Borders and other media freedom organizations sent a letter to the head of the European Union‚Äôs executive arm in March, warning that Mr. Jansa could ‚Äúuse the pulpit‚Äù of the European presidency ‚Äúto attack journalists‚Äù at home and across the bloc.

This, they said, ‚Äúis deeply troubling and could have a normalizing effect on this kind of behavior in the future.‚Äù",Slovenia,/r/europe/comments/o3jaz3/wielding_twitter_europes_marshal_twito_takes_aim/h2c2mdt/,XaraTeam,1624118712

Most of the changes are countries going from buying American towards buying from others in order to be less dependant on the US, and country going from the others (France/Italy/Sweden/UK/Russia...) to the US in order to have the American protection paid. 

Between France/Italy/UK/Sweden/Germany/Russia.... it really move left and right a lot and is really dependant on either their alliance/links to different government or demonstration of capabilities of the different ship/planes/whatever else (which is why the Rafale are selling a lot right now). 

In the case of Egypt, the country is trying to solidify its links with the EU in general and with Israel, so buying from different countries help them push that goal, and also make them less dependant on a single country (in order to avoid an ""US-lite"" situation).

2179,"&gt; After relations deteriorated between Romania and Yugoslavia, which was excluded from the Cominform in 1948, the border between the two states became a sensitive area for Bucharest (see Informbiro period). The ethnic minorities present there, especially in the Banat, were considered ""elements with a heightened risk factor"". Following the Soviet model of the Gulag, on March 15, 1951 the Ministry of Interior of the Romanian People's Republic issued the following decree:

&gt;&gt; The Ministry of Interior will be able, through a decision, to order the removal from population centres of any persons whose presence in those centres is unjustified, as well as the removal of those from any locality who, through their actions before the working people, endanger the construction of socialism in the Romanian People's Republic. For those in question obligatory residences can be set up in any locality.

Interesting part of history, I didn't know about it.

&gt; During the night of June 18, 1951, the third-largest mass deportation in modern Romanian history took place, surpassed only by the World War II deportation of Jews to Transnistria (considered collectively, and ended with massive extermination), and the January 1945 deportation of ethnic Germans from Romania. Up to 45,000 people were taken from their homes and deported to the BƒÉrƒÉgan. These included Romanians, Germans (mostly Banat Swabians), Serbs, Bulgarians, Banat Czechs, and some Ukrainian refugees from Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, and Aromanians.

&gt; The deportees were taken under military guard and left to build houses of mud or adobe on their own in eighteen localities. In 1956, a change in government policy meant that the majority of deportees returned home, but some chose to stay permanently in the BƒÉrƒÉgan Plains. 

It seems most of them returned after 5 years that's probably why its not mentioned that much, as it didn't affect the demography in the long run.",–†–µ–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞ –°—Ä–±–∏—ò–∞,/r/europe/comments/o3ct0v/on_this_day_70_years_ago_the_romanian_communist/h2bqcxc/,atomsk11,1624112211

2191,"TL;DR No I'm not arguing about Sartre, I'm arguing against the idea that being a Marxist is a fair reason to dismiss him and/or makes him comparable to an editor of Pravada. Detailed explantion below -


I feel like you are missing my point. Let's look at what I said to frame my entire post 

&gt;You don't have to agree with Sarte but it's rubbish to say that because he's a Marxist you automatically dismiss everything he says in the same way you would a high ranking propaganda minister or editor in an authoritarian regime.

I clearly identify the issue not being criticising Sarte's opinion, or crticising the USSR, but you saying that the reason you can dismiss him is for being a Marxist. This is unfair and as I said not just anti-communist or anti-USSR or whtaever but anti-intellectual. 

To reiterate I literally say ""you don't have to agree with Sartre"". So I feel you charctersing my argument as ""All those words just to dispute the fact that Sartre was heavily biased"" is a clear misreprenation of what I said which would be hard to arrive at in good faith. All those words are to demonstrate that Sarte being a Marxist is not in itself not a point for or against his credibility on this subject, contrary to your implication many Marxists are not sympathetic to the USSR or Stalin.

And I did not misrepresent what you said

&gt;And a marxist (and later a supporter of maoism). His opinion on the matter is about as useful as that of the chief editor of the Pravda.

Maybe you didn't communicate it clearly? You clear identify him being a Marxist as the issue, if that's not what you meant it's not what you typed. 

&gt;namely that he was a Marxist therefore ideologically motivated

But everyone across the entire political spectrum is influenced by their ideology, it literally is the ideas and theories we view the world through. If you care so much about context then is it not misleading to represent him being Marxist in this way? As I've shown many Marxists ideology leads to them be critical of some or all of the USSR, this is fundamentally difference to the Prava editor you chose to compare him to.

You said 

&gt;His opinion on the matter is about as useful as that of the chief editor of the Pravda.

And the *only* expalnation you offer for that is him being a Marxist.

So you either miscommunicated or are chaning your argument if you now say that I'm right that Sarte being a Marxist is not a problem in itself. If you merely meant to add in this for wider context then why then compare him to an editor of the party paper in an authoritarian regime?

Put it this way; what would you think of a socialist or Marxist who dismissed a liberal academic out of hand simply because they were a liberal?

In ancient societies, people respected and prayed to the trees, make offerings and even hug them to show their appreciation. Pre- Islamic Turkic tribes who were shamans prayed to the Tengri (God) through temples built near trees. They made wishes to their creator through trees and this practiced evolved into wishing trees after the Turks accepted Islam as their religion. 

A wishing tree is essentially an individual tree which has been chosen and is used for offerings and wishes. Such trees are identified as living beings possessing a special religious or spiritual value.


Wishing trees (dilek aƒüacƒ± in Turkish) can be found everywhere around Anatolia and they are very distinctive thanks to the colorful pieces of cloth hanging from their branches. Turkish people believe that these trees can bring them one step closer to their wishes and tie a piece of cloth to tie their wish to the tree. In some regions, however, people hang evil eye talismans instead of cloths. In fact, wishing trees can be found in different cultures all over the world. In Japan, the festival named Tanabata is dedicated to the wishing trees during which people hang paper, with wishes written on them, from bamboo trees.

2387,"&gt;And our gun murder rate is still half that of yours.

It is not half, 2.4 vs 1.6... And we have twice the guns. Your point being what exactly? If we account for that disparity... we get to the point where each gun in Czechia is used wrongly more often.

It is a difference in attitude. Guns that are bought for self defense are seen as problem solvers. They are then used to solve problems. That is just logical.  


Ands if illegal guns are a problem, wouldn't it make sense to do something about that instead of adding more guns? That is what USA did and do you REALLY want that shitshow in Europe?

Do not EVER bring in anecdotes of ONE single case as a proof. Use statistics. Gun nuts are always doing this, pulling peoples heartstrings but the truth is that those things are VERY VERY rare. We can not have perfect safety in any area and have to accept some casualties from about every policy made.

Also, it seems that ideal solution for you there was that the ""murderer"" was killed.. not that he was captured and rehabilitated and returned to the society. That is the ideal outcome.

I doubt Russia wants to be an empire. 

&gt;The fact that we have to compare Russia to Germany instead of China or America is already a problem. 

Russia doesn't have 330million or 1.5 billion people. You can only compare Russia to Japan or Germany.

2-4% is still a lot. If you compare Russia in 2010 to 2020 the economy almost doubled in 10 years. Despite maintaining high interest rates and tight fiscal policies with little spending.

&gt;China's is 6%

China is exceptional, should not compare 1.5 billion people to a 150 million.  

&gt;Especially considering that 1/3 of Russian GDP is oil and gas.

Act No. 119/2002 Coll., on Firearms and Ammunition, disagrees with you:

&gt;Pr√°vo nab√Ωvat, dr≈æet a nosit zbra≈à je zaruƒçeno za podm√≠nek stanoven√Ωch t√≠mto z√°konem.

Translation: The right to acquire, own, and carry a weapon (the law specifically talks about firearms as weapons, it's a Czech thing) is guaranteed under the conditions defined by this law.

Afaik, they're also a right in Switzerland.

&gt;Self defence is, but that doesn't have anything to do with guns specifically.

Well, yeah, self-defense is a basic human right, or part of one anyway.

&gt;Also a gun's primary purpose is to wound or kill.

That depends on the purpose you acquire it for. Hell, many guns arent even designed to wound or kill, theyre made for for sport.

&gt;That's the point of it being a weapon.

If used as such, yes. Our law specifies anything that can makes an attack stronger as a weapon. So even a shard of glass is considered a weapon. 

&gt;but I can also say with certainty that should that right, constitutional or not, violate EU law, then the country will get sued and fined.

It very well might happen. Given how many Western countries basically ban carrying almost any weapon for self-defense, it might get worse. But thats the point of the constitutional amendment, it doesnt talk about guns specifically, it talks about weapons in general.

&gt;In an interview for a 2001 book by this reporter, ‚ÄúThe Brother,‚Äù Mr. Greenglass acknowledged that he had lied when he testified that his sister had typed his notes about the bomb ¬ó the single most incriminating evidence against her. His allegation emerged months after Mr. Greenglass and his wife testified before the grand jury and only weeks before the 1951 trial.  
&gt;  
&gt;Government prosecutors later acknowledged that they had hoped that a conviction and the possibility of a death sentence against Ethel Rosenberg would persuade her husband to confess and implicate others, including some agents known to investigators through secretly intercepted Soviet cables. That strategy failed, said William P. Rogers, who was the deputy attorney general at the time. ‚ÄúShe called our bluff,‚Äù he said in ‚ÄúThe Brother.‚Äù

Due to the scarce amount of documents around it, the history of this island has been almost unknown up to 1910, when the gentleman Vincenzo Richieri decided to build here a neo-gothic castle as his private house. The two-storied neo-gothic castle, named Castelo della Isola di Loreto was commissioned to be built around that time; the architect was Luigi Tombola. Lark and pine trees were planted around the castle.

Like a fairytale come to life, the small Loreto island is set amidst the dramatic background of snow capped mountains and features a neo-gothic castle perched on the edge of a cliff, plenty of greenery, two lighthouses, and a marina.

‚ÄúFor the part that is actually relevant, notice how it says can and not should:‚Äù

Because they left mask policy up to municipalities. 

‚ÄúTake a walk in Norway outside of the capital, and tell me how many people you see wearing masks. I usually live in the second-biggest city, and it was many months into the pandemic before I saw a person with a mask on. In my hometown, literally no one.‚Äù

From the EU, two - BioNTech and Janssen.

Most of the others were steamrolled by the early numbers from trials of Oxford/AZ and the production success of BioNTech/Pfizer. IIRC, around the time Oxford announced their first study results, Sanofi dropped out of the race and stopped the development on their Covid vaccine. Had they known about the production issues that AZ ran into later on, maybe they wouldn't have dropped out, but who knows. By the time BioNTech had their vaccine proven and Pfizer got production ramped up without any delays, others were about to start their last study phases and got problems to find suitable numbers of participants across all age groups because everyone in the risk groups wanted to get the real vaccine that was already available to them. Some companies had to move their studies into poorer parts of the world at short notice and then ran into issues with variants.

In early 2020, it was not really expected that we would have vaccinated 70% of people in Europe and North America with a vaccine with 90%+ efficacy by August 2021.

2828,"The UK wants to change its rules around share trading to adapt to life after Brexit, in an effort to entice EU share deals back to the City of London.

EU share trading quickly fled the UK after the full terms of the country‚Äôs departure from the bloc kicked in at the start of this year, with cities like Amsterdam and Paris picking up the slack for the ‚Ç¨8bn-a-day business. The EU did not recognise UK stock exchanges as having standards equivalent to its own, which meant its institutions were barred from using London-based venues.

To redress the balance, the UK Treasury has said it would like to boost off-exchange trading venues known as dark pools. Other proposals under consideration include easing the minimum pricing increments, known as tick sizes, on lightly regulated private venues run by banks and high-frequency traders, according to people involved in the discussions.

The government will launch a full consultation over the summer in a review of the UK‚Äôs wholesale financial markets. An announcement may come as early as the start of July in chancellor Rishi Sunak‚Äôs annual speech in the City of London, say people with knowledge of the plans.

London has portrayed its reforms as ‚Äúambitious‚Äù, while also ensuring its rule book is fair, competitive and of the highest regulatory standards.

‚ÄúThe question is what the UK does post-Brexit without equivalence,‚Äù said Rebecca Healey, founder of Redlap Consulting, a capital markets consultancy. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a political desire to find a benefit and demonstrate that Brexit is a good thing for the market. But running two rules books is something people don‚Äôt want. You have to be careful what you tweak,‚Äù she said.

Changes to the vast pan-European Mifid II package of market regulations would be needed for the UK to achieve its goals here, potentially opening up another fissure between British and European authorities over financial services.

But the prospect is also dividing market participants in London between those wanting more freedom to trade where they want, and those worried diverging rules will raise operational and technology costs and further fragment the market.
Line chart of Dark pool trades on major indices, % showing London investors trade in the dark

Dark pool restrictions have become one of the touchstones for those arguing EU standards do not fit UK markets. The UK has long been at odds with the EU on the venues, which allow fund managers to buy and sell large blocks of shares without disturbing the price on the market. The UK has long regarded them as a benefit to investors.

The EU, worried about the growth in off-exchange trading, set caps in 2013 on the amount of business that could be executed in dark pools, both in individual stocks and on one venue.

In February more than 16 per cent of trades in UK blue-chip stocks were conducted in a dark pool, a record and the highest of all major indices in Europe according to data from Rosenblatt Securities.

Those figures may rise further after the final set of caps, last imposed when the UK was part of the single market, rolled off in early June and the regulator said they would not be extended.

The Treasury also wants to kill an EU rule called the ‚Äúshare trading obligation‚Äù, which determines where shares can be traded and was designed to stop banks from matching their customers‚Äô deals on their internal trading desks, bypassing the exchange and saving on fees.

‚ÄúThe UK could create an environment that results in UK venues regaining market share in EU stocks,‚Äù said Anish Puaar, market structure analyst at Rosenblatt Securities in London.

‚ÄúEU firms wouldn‚Äôt be able to trade on these venues, but UK, US, Asian firms could. If a significant amount of EU share trading moves back to the UK, it will then be interesting to see how the EU reacts.‚Äù

But alongside deleting unwanted EU rules lies the issue of what replaces them, if anything.

A 2017 paper by the FCA found dark trading began to damage liquidity on the UK market once it reached more than 15 per cent of the total value traded.

Data from BMLL, a UK group, has highlighted the difficult problem policymakers face. The amount of dark trading in blue-chip French and German stocks in the UK has risen from 29 per cent in January to half the monthly volume in June, it found.

The gains came after the FCA in March made it easier to trade EU shares in London, cutting the trade size threshold that qualifies for a UK dark pool to just ‚Ç¨15,000. That compares to ‚Ç¨650,000 in the EU.

But Elliot Banks, head of product development at BMLL, said the shift to dark pools was more likely because of wider spreads ‚Äî the difference between the price quoted to purchase a share and the level to sell ‚Äî on UK exchanges. 

The findings underscore that in spite of the political rhetoric, brokers remain highly sensitive to cost and pricing across different markets. ‚ÄúThe question will be whether it‚Äôs worth adjusting our order routing systems for the UK,‚Äù said one trader at a London investment bank.

‚ÄúWe must be careful not to win business back to the UK for the sake of it, but for what‚Äôs best for the UK market,‚Äù said Alasdair Haynes, chief executive of Aquis Exchange, the share trading venue.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/o33v79/uk_plans_rule_changes_to_lure_back_eu/h29qssj/,trolls_brigade,1624061409

2975,"Belated reply, but I think it should go without saying that someone who is close to their goal (relatively, anyways) and is still very well off will likely be better off at their goal than someone who is very far away. Sure, they'll likely not be *as* well off, but it seems a reasonable presumption that they would be better positioned than other nations. Again, you have less extreme changes to make, so you will likely have significant parts of society unchanged or only moderately changed.

And, I get what you mean, about emissions being a global issue. Sure. No one nation can do it on their own. But at the same time, it means everyone has to contribute. Everyone will be **pressured** to contribute. Consequences will attempt to be imposed or conditions imposed mandating they help. People who are pretty low emissions from the start, though? Less pressure. Less demands. And being low emissions in comparison to wealth level also means you will likely have to be coerced less, since your new standard of living will likely be pretty well off still.

Again, being closer to your goal just means you won't be under as much fire, you won't be taking as much of a hit as you push forward (again, assuming that it doesn't have some catastrophic failure caused by pursuing its goal), and you will ultimately likely have excess wealth compared to others making more drastic changes. And yes, I think that excess wealth will somewhat remain even taking into account aid, because I suspect that there will be some sort of cap on what a country is expected to both give in aid and devote towards transition (which will benefit those with small transitions relative to others).",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/o18dy2/most_resilient_and_vulnerable_countries_to_rising/h29e50w/,ptWolv022,1624054488

3058,"&gt;You can't fortify the SEA's. And Greece has islands almost swimmable distance from Turkish mainland. And the moment they are in those lands they are EUROPES problem. And I can assure you that if our state wanted to they can EASILY make that happen. fortifying the already tiny land borders means pretty much nothing. Which even those land borders are easily passable.

Sure, but they are illegal migrants either way. This means that the islands will get buried under people for a while, then express check points will be build to check their status in a matter of hours and then send them back... you saw what happened when Erdogan attempted to play refugee games, the Greeks protected their border with armed forces.

All of this would cause a diplomatic crisis of untold proportions and so on and on... definitely not a solution.

&gt;don't believe it's a ""joke"". They get what they want that way or another. Just think about it. Merkel made deal with just ONE MAN

Yes. Merkel did. The EU just followed. Germany and France are still great powers regionally and they have the means to take such action. I agree with all of your other points.

The situation in the EU is such: single countries can't handle the entire region by themselves, not even France or Germany, so they do not take any action, but at the same time they refuse to give the EU the means and power to take collective action, so nothing is done. From what I see in Turkey (akp) politicians use the issue to their advantage and again have no will to really fix the issue and Turkey - like France and Germany, can't fix the entire Middle East by itself.

With that said the EU is taking action - preparing significant investment plans into North Africa and the Middle East in order to improve conditions and peoples lives so they don't have to resort to illegal migration and we will probably get some EU military coalition, but not any time soon.

I hope the next Turkish government will not resort to political circus like what Erdogan is doing and instead seriously work with the EU to actually solve the issue - the Turkish military can stabilize the region with EU member state support and the EU can provide the investment needed to rebuild and get people back into a functioning society.

3147,"**II. THE CONTEXT**

**4**.  
It is undisputed that ASTRAZENECA is active in the scientific biopharmaceutical sector and in the production of so-called ""innovative"" medicines.

The dispute concerns the consequences of the delay in the manufacture of a vaccine ""against Covid-19"" ordered by the EUROPEAN UNION for the benefit of its MEMBER STATES and which the latter attributes to ASTRAZENECA.

**5.**

*&lt; ... Some general information about the vaccine itself ... &gt;*

**6.**

&lt; ... &gt;

It is clear from the parties' explanations that the delay in delivery of the disputed Vaccines is, in this case, linked to the delay in the manufacture of the medicinal substance, which was confirmed following an investigation by 3 members of the European Commission's staff (Exhibit 42 of ASTRAZENECA's dossier).

**7**.

ASTRAZENECA does not produce the Vaccine itself but uses external manufacturing sites to which it transfers the commercial manufacturing process and a stock of COVID-19 virus seeds and harmless host cells. This transfer is called ""technology transfer"".

The manufacturing sites concerned are equipped with specific bioreactors and equipment enabling them to cultivate and modify live viruses (Exhibit 9a of ASTRAZENECA's dossier).

It is not disputed that the number of doses that can be manufactured by these sites can vary and depends on many factors, including, in particular, (i) the number of bioreactors available, (ii) the size of the bioreactor, which is calculated in litres, (iii) the duration of the production cycle and (iv) the yield of the bioreactor, which is calculated in terms of the number of doses per litre (see in particular Exhibit 31 of ASTRAZENECA's dossier showing the yield rate of several manufacturing sites).

Furthermore, the parties agree that, as the commercial manufacturing process is developed from an initial small-scale process before being scaled up to increase productivity yields with a view to mass production, it cannot be ruled out that the final yield will deviate from the yield expected on the basis of the clinical trials.

**8.**

*&lt; ... Background information about the EMA approval process ... &gt;*

As a precautionary measure, some EU Member States decided to no longer offer the Vaccine to its citizens or to limit its use to certain categories of them (Exhibits 38a and 38b of ASTRAZENECA's dossier).

Upon questioning, the EUROPEAN UNION explains that this is not as such a restriction on the marketing authorisation previously granted but a decision by the MEMBER STATES, as purchasers, not to use the vaccines acquired.

**9.**  
Concerning the manufacture of the medicinal product as such, the Medicines Directive provides that Member States shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the manufacture of medicinal products on their territory is subject to the possession of an authorisation, even if the medicinal product is manufactured for export.

This authorisation is only granted subject to compliance with certain requirements laid down in Article 40 et seq. of the Directive, the purpose of which is to ensure compliance with the standards of good manufacturing practice.

It was emphasised at the hearing that ASTRAZENECA took care to specify to EMA the manufacturing sites of the active vaccine, which proves to be correct on examination of the product characteristics drawn up by EMA (exhibit 20 of the EUROPEAN UNION dossier).",üáßüá™ L'union fait la force,/r/europe/comments/o2tmqr/the_text_of_the_court_ruling_in_the_commission_vs/h28ijrx/,Dobbelsteentje,1624039788

3165,"Because if you reward illegal border crossings with settlement you create a huge pull factor which will be utterly unsustainable.

You seriously need to understand the depth of the problem our continent is facing over the next few years and decades. Several billion of the worlds poorest are about to be (and starting to) get hit by major climate change problems.

Famine. Drought. Disease. Inevitable conflict.

These people have two directions they can flee. West (Europe) and East (Asia). I would guess that the majority would rather come to Europe.

We need to get tough on our borders now. Ruthlessly tough. We need to **only** accept people who come here legally through systems we set up. Everybody else who is illegal needs their biometrics to be taken and to be added to a permanent blacklist banning them from our entire continent. 

It does not matter whether it‚Äôs a highly skilled neurosurgeon, a woman with 20 young children, whatever. You either apply legally through one of our external camps, to be processed properly and then settles as needed, or you fuck off.

And we need to substantially increase our joint, continent wide funding of border security. And it has to be continent wide, not just an EU agency. It needs to be akin to NATO. We have to use this border security in conjunction with Interpol and our various national facilities (intelligence, police, judicial, military) to rain a bloody holy wrath upon people smugglers and any entity who seeks to circumvent our immigration systems.

No matter how harsh that is, it is literally **needed**. If we don‚Äôt do this, within the next few decades we could see a **billion** of the worlds poor, uneducated flood across our borders. Our social security system in Europe will utterly collapse under the weight and every single one of our lives will be appalling.

I believe, but would need to double check, that Germans, aka Deutsch, have the most unique ""roots"".

&gt; 52.Finally, while it is undeniable that the EUROPEAN UNION and the MEMBER STATES must have been aware that ASTRAZENECA was not in an exclusive relationship with them, they seemed to be unaware of the exact content of ASTRAZENECA's commitments elsewhere. The priority for the United Kingdom seems to have been discovered when Mr. Soriot referred to it in the press on January 26, 2021. There is no evidence to counter the allegations of the EUROPEAN UNION that the exact content of this priority remained unknown until the day ASTRAZENECA produced the contract in support of its main conclusions of 7 May 2021. It is moreover quite symptomatic that despite the fact that ASTRAZENECA is bound by an obligation to inform, in particular, about ""the difficulties (...) in setting up the supply chain for the Vaccine"", the latter did not at any time consider it necessary to mention in its slides either the existence or the execution of the priority supply contract in question, even though these are elements that clearly have a negative impact on the supply of the EUROPEAN UNION. In addition, it seems that it is precisely when parties are in negotiations with other contracting parties that the type of declarations and guarantees contained in Article 13.1 (e) of the APA are useful. A marginal examination of the file shows that if it is true that the EUROPEAN UNION cannot deprive ASTRAZENECA of the right to conclude agreements with third parties - which would be disturbing in the context of the pandemic -, this article 13.1(e) prevents ASTRAZENECA, as in the present case, from relying on a priority supply contract concluded, in complete opacity, with a third party to justify the non-fulfilment of the APA.",,/r/europe/comments/o2otwc/belgian_court_orders_astrazeneca_to_deliver/h27me0z/,thet-bes,1624025363

Greece had around 34 million international visitors in 2019, this has been growing around 2 million a year since 2014, when it was 24 million.

In 2020 there were an estimated 7.4 million (78% drop).  A 50% increase would mean a target of 11 million visitors, about 1/3 of 2019 record.  However, previously the target has been 50% of 2019, which would be around 17 million.

International tourism is not the only type and domestic tourism had also seen a 53.5% decline last year, looking at domestic flights and ship numbers.

3807,"The Appeal of 18 June (L'Appel du 18 juin) was the first speech made by Charles de Gaulle after his arrival in London in 1940 following the Fall of France. Broadcast to France by the radio services of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), it is often considered to have represented the origin of the French Resistance in World War II. It is regarded as one of the most important speeches in French history.

De Gaulle had recently been promoted to the rank of Brigadier General and named as Under-Secretary of State for National Defence and War by Prime Minister Paul Reynaud during the German invasion of France.

Reynaud resigned after his proposal for a Franco-British Union was rejected by his cabinet and Marshal Philippe P√©tain, a hero of World War I, became the new Prime Minister, pledging to sign an armistice with Nazi Germany. De Gaulle opposed any such action and facing imminent arrest, fled France on 17 June. Other leading politicians, including Georges Mandel, L√©on Blum, Pierre Mend√®s France, Jean Zay and √âdouard Daladier (and separately Reynaud), were arrested while travelling to continue the war from North Africa.

De Gaulle obtained special permission from Winston Churchill to broadcast a speech on 18 June via BBC Radio from Broadcasting House over France, despite the British Cabinet's objections that such a broadcast could provoke the P√©tain government into a closer allegiance with Germany. In his speech, de Gaulle reminded the French people that the British Empire and the United States of America would support them militarily and economically in an effort to retake France from the Germans.

&gt;""The leaders who, for many years, were at the head of French armies, have formed a government. This government, alleging our armies to be undone, agreed with the enemy to stop fighting. Of course, we were subdued by the mechanical, ground and air forces of the enemy. Infinitely more than their number, it was the tanks, the airplanes, the tactics of the Germans which made us retreat. It was the tanks, the airplanes, the tactics of the Germans that surprised our leaders to the point to bring them there where they are today.  
&gt;  
&gt;""But has the last word been said? Must hope disappear? Is defeat final? No!  
&gt;  
&gt;""Believe me, I speak to you with full knowledge of the facts and tell you that nothing is lost for France. The same means that overcame us can bring us to a day of victory. For France is not alone! She is not alone! She is not alone! She has a vast Empire behind her. She can align with the British Empire that holds the sea and continues the fight. She can, like England, use without limit the immense industry of United States.  
&gt;  
&gt;""This war is not limited to the unfortunate territory of our country. This war is not finished by the battle of France. This war is a world wide war. All the faults, all the delays, all the suffering, do not prevent there to be, in the world, all the necessary means to one day crush our enemies. Vanquished today by mechanical force, we will be able to overcome in the future by a superior mechanical force. The destiny of the world is here. I, General de Gaulle, currently in London, invite the officers and the French soldiers who are located in British territory or who would come there, with their weapons or without their weapons, I invite the engineers and the special workers of armament industries who are located in British territory or who would come there, to put themselves in contact with me.

No matter how much I hate or love woke culture I'll not vote for someone that wants to implement market rents. Or someone who admires Ayn Rand and Thatcher. 


Even if I want the police to get better resources I won't vote for a party that supports fucking RUT. lmao what a joke of a concept that was veiled as something to aid elderly when paying for their assistance when it in truth turned out to mainly be utilized for barbecue help, cleaning services for wealthy people, and even private DJ sets.

3942,"China's been really pushing the ""special economic zones"", the giant mega-engineering projects, and ""investment"" approach as their economic leverage tool.

The SEZs are essentially Chinese only enclaves that ignore the laws and regulations of the host nation when they can get them approved (they've been doing this in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Sri Lanka) as they're treated almost like colonies.  

The big engineering projects are debt traps, projects requiring massive loans that the host country can never pay off, os the Chinese government uses that as leverage to extract concessions (this is done a lot in Africa, but in Laos and Cambodia quite a bit too, and was tried in Myanmar... not sure about Indonesia, but I'd be shocked it it wasn't the case thee too).

The ""investment"" is just pure capitalistic leverage, used to gain power in the local economies and political structure.  This is being done all through SE Asia, in Australia, in a lot of Eastern Europe, and across Africa, as well as the US to a certain degree.  It was used in Spain quite a bit too.

Some of this is straight-up copying the past and present tactics of the US and Europe, some of it is copying and expanding on the practices of the IMF and World Bank (the big international investment/loan banks China has have more money available than the IMF and WB combined), and some of the engineering projects are aimed at not only establishing a debt trap for nations but to prop up the construction bubble China is in.  The Belts-and-Roads Initiative is a good example of the latter.","American, living in Vietnam, working for Germans",/r/europe/comments/o23qxw/mh17_court_has_just_published_clear_evidences/h25y6ko/,7LeagueBoots,1623982963

4070,"&gt; Your brain is clearly broken from the newspeak.

This ""newspeak"" had to be invented to disambiguate between what we now call Old Ruthenian and modern day Russian. It would be pretty naive to expect the Russian language to be renamed to restore ""historical justice"".

&gt;Yes, of course everyone called themselves Old Belarusians 500 years ago, because we call them such right now, no trouble applying contemporary tags to people half a millennium ago. 

Have I ever said that they called themselves Old Belarusians? I'm pretty sure the people inhabiting these lands called themselves either ruthenian (—Ä—É—Å–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏/—Ä—É—Å–∫–∏–º–∏) or litvinian (a bit controversial, I know). However, the previous names are not *that* important. What *is* important is that even schoolchildren know that Skaryna had little to do with what is now called Russia.

&gt; This is what happens when people have no humanities education to speak of, but have a foreign agenda and a lot of Dunning-Kruger. You might as well call Vergil an Old Romanian and be done with it.

A typical Russian disinformation strategy. Provide just one side of the story, call it ""education"", sprinkle some whataboutisms on top, and simply ignore any inconsistencies that even a person with no formal education in history can spot.

The data is the same for the UK, about 84% unvaccinated, 14% with one dose and 1-2% with two (no data of which vaccine) getting it, so it's clear vaccines work. AZ might work slightly worse than Pfizer (no data, even estimated, not official for Moderna or J&amp;J as the UK uses neither), but for now it is quite obvious that any vaccine after two doses will hold Delta at bay. AZ failed with the ZA variant and nothing else. Many others weren't even tested against it, as the variant proved recessive and lost to UK/Brazil/Indian ones.


So it's still a battle between vaccines and the Delta Variant, at the point and all vaccines (except maybe one Chinese one, see Seychelles) are doing well. I'm sorry but I'm NOT a fan of making it into AZ vs Pfizer or vector vs mRNA thingy, as the only way out of this per current science is to vaccinate, with whatever. But just people far and wide.

The problems with the cyclical nature of solar energy has actually been solved already (and at a price cheaper than that of nuclear for the more southern countries). Take a look at concentrated solar power, it is a fascinating project with large room for improvement still.

As for the neccesity of baseload, I've seen a couple of peer reviewed articles disputing the neccesity, though it is absolutely not the consensus yet.

Wind (especially onshore) is incredibly cheap and very very clean, even compared to nuclear. Personally I prefer a mix of wind and gas to that of nuclear and gas.

This is the net result.

&gt; We have to either import people or make a LOT more babies.

And when we ""import people"" to increase our population we will need to take in even more people in the future for the exact same reason in a never ending circle. Endless growth in the population in this form can more or less be sustained if you abolish the welfare state and accept a massive underclass in your society. But that's not what people want. Your argument is basically a pyramid scheme.

&gt; Your link has a lot of great replacement shit.... It talks about the year 2100 for fucks sake. It also includes the OIL FUNDS money given as part of that... like the family of four would get more without immigration. There are no sources for the calculations made, we are literally trusting on someone words.

This is an article by the Norwegian state channel reporting on a report by the national statistical institute. I don't know how much more trust worthy you can get than this.

&gt; There are of course the humanitarian reasons to add on top; what if it costs if the end result is less human suffering?

The Nordic countries have been taking in close to the amount of people they can manage from these backgrounds, while keeping their welfare state afloat. And in the grand scheme of things it doesn't make a blip. 

Here's a thought about this. In the last 200 years, the people living in poverty fell from 80% of the global population to 20% (even if the number of people has exploded). A good example of why that is can be found in the success China has had. Helping whole countries develop is what will actually reduce suffering, not huge spending huge amount on a select few, relative to the planet's population living in poverty.",,/r/europe/comments/o1nvna/on_this_day_in_1397_the_kingdoms_of_denmark/h254vfh/,TheVerusian,1623967581

&gt;This could not be further from the truth. Even if you exclude the last 4 years of ultra-nationalist-fascist MHP partnership of the government, all kinds of fascist organizations related to Turkish nationalism has been around in the government and military ranks.  80% of Turks would either identify as conservative or nationalist. Children are bombarded by Turkish mythologies, wars, conquests, how it is a prideful act to die for the homeland etc. That might be normal for you, but since you are using western terms, this is not civic nationalism you'd expect in the west. Not in 21st century.

You're missing the point. I didn't count ultra-nationalists because my statement does not cover them. They are a joke and as a Turk who has knows many people in the gov't and high ranks, no they do not make 80% of anything. And no children are not bombarded with such mythologies, if they were I'd be here talking about them. There is patriotism (like in every country) and nationalism which can be toxic. Distinguish between the two, we're on the same page if you take a breath and listen to me.

&gt;Would you talk the same if the victim was a CHP or IYIP supporter? For years, these people have been the target of terrorists with similar views. There is clearly a organized suppression campaign targeted against HDP. Of course defenders of a pluralist democracy can be expected to stand for them.

People like Deniz Poyraz have unfortunately been victims. 40,000 Kurds and Turks have been victims of the PKK. I don't say support x party because they killed these people.

The USSR sacrificied 26 million men to kill the nazis. Both France and UK lost their empires due to the war and the subsequent losses of lives in the colonies. The Allies would have won, even if the US didn't intervene. Don't get me wrong, it's great you guys came and it was the best decision for absolutely everyone. However, the USSR could have probably handled it alone, they were a superpower even at that time.

It's not about patting someone on the back, it's about giving credit where credit is due. They economically aided Germany but they militarily stopped Germany. They were a huge help for the Allies. Saying that they are equally responsible as Germany is plain stupid, like I shouldn't even have to explain this kind of stupid. 

Also, I'm french and to me it's a great dishonor to remember how P√©tain acted on behalf of France. Today is the anniversary of his call to surrender btw. I'm ashamed of how my country acted. Still, I do not believe we were responsible for the conflit - at least regarding the appeasement policy. We did a terrible job and we were as stupid as can be. However the fault remains on Germany. It's not others' job to stop you from waging war, it's your own.

4330,"USSR and Nazi Germany, being radical ideological states that opposed the old order, have been both ostracized by the traditionalist European powers. They deemed themselves the islands of progress against a backdrop of stagnation, and were both under heavy economic restrictions and sanctions. 

So in the early 30s, they had quite warm, although paranoid, relations. They knew they were not friends, but the fruit of partnership was too sweet to resist. For example, without Soviet Union, Germany would not have their dreaded tank units - they were trained inside USSR by Soviet instructors. Without Germany, USSR would not have enough copper and other metals to carry out its electrification program, to build radios and phone lines. The trade representatives involved were all later executed in 1937-1938 because Stalin feared they were spying for Germany, even though he was himself volunteering classified information obtained from Allies to them.

The last people executed for anti-German sentiment in USSR were killed weeks after the invasion has already began.

Stalin has heavily repressed Jews because most of Lenin's closest and most powerful supporters were Jewish. Stalin could not be publicly seen as singling out Lenin's Guard, but he could arrest them as a part of a much larger scheme to punish a whole ethnicity - that was not an uncommon event under Stalin.",,/r/europe/comments/o1r4r5/81_years_ago_on_this_day_latvia_was_invaded_by/h247d09/,OleKosyn,1623953063

So? A huge number still live in London.

&gt; ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ sure, and I am the king of France. As the saying goes, if you walk like a duck....

You need to get off the internet and speak to some real people, then you'll realise that the average remoaner you find on reddit is so far removed from the normal remainer they can't even see one another. 

Most of us who voted remain still think it was a mistake to leave, but it's done now and we aren't going to fight to get back in. In fact, given the chance to rejoin I, and plenty of other people I know, would probably vote against - the EU has tarnished its reputation in this country over the last few years and internet echo chambers are utterly in denial of this. The vast majority of people in the UK just want to move on with life, if that's outside the EU it's fine. 

&gt; No, young people don't drive up the need for healthcare, as we don't get sick that often.

Young people are not as much of a burden as old people, but they are still a burden. They do still get sick. Younger women get pregnant and have children, the NHS foots the bill for that. You act like young people cost the public health service nothing, which is moronic. 

&gt; ot to mention that EU nationals provided a good chunk of the non UK doctors and nurses to begin with

EU nationals in the UK are roughly 6% of the population, and EU nationals in the NHS are around 5% of the workforce. They balance each other out more or less. Basically if you removed all of the EU nationals from the UK (which I would never advocate, this is just to prove a point), it wouldn't make much difference to the viability of the health service - it's a absurd myth that the NHS *depends* on EU workers. 

&gt; lol so your line of defence is "" we are not as bad as you""? 

Racism exists *everywhere*, you started this whole chain by suggesting that the UK is unwelcoming. My counterargument is that the UK is more welcoming than most other places, even within Western Europe. So it's a perfectly valid point.

&gt; Not to mention that a lot of those reports are doctored, like the most recent one published by the govt where institutionlised racism has been down played to make Johnson look good. 

I don't think you understand what 'doctored' means, because even the most damning criticism of that report doesn't suggest it was doctored.

Maybe it downplays institutional racism a bit, but what is unarguable is that BLM, certain Labour MPs and a bunch of Guardian readers massively overstate how much institutional racism there is.

As I've already explained to you, socioeconomic factors explain far more about demographic inequality than can be attributed to institutional racism.

coordinate our policies and actions we plan to establish an EU-US high-level dialogue on Russia.

Russia can operate in a safe, secure and productive fashion. We urge Russia to stop its continuous
crackdown on civil society, the opposition and independent media and release all political prisoners.

cooperation in areas of common interest. We also commit to work together to address the urgent

integrity of the EU‚Äôs Eastern partners and will support the reform path of Ukraine, Georgia, and the
Republic of Moldova. We resolve to work towards long-term peace, resilience and stability in the
South Caucasus. We stand with the people of Belarus and their demands for human rights and
democracy. We resolve to hold the Lukashenka regime to account for its escalating attacks on
human rights and fundamental freedoms and for endangering aviation safety through the
unprecedented and unacceptable forced diversion of an EU passenger airplane under false
pretences, and the subsequent arrest of a journalist as part of a continuing assault on opposition

4541,"&gt;Security installations are to prevent or monitor the movement of people, not goods;

If we could find a way to check goods without stopping people, our problems are resolved.

&gt;The Commission then ran with this and made any deal conditional on NI remaining in the single market.

That's putting the horse behind the cart. Keeping NI alligned is the only way to avoid security installations on the island.

&gt;One of the first things the UK asked for was to establish a working group to study how to handle the NI border in a frictionless way. The EU refused to consider it. When a European Parliamentary committee began working on alternative solutions, the Commission shut it down and buried their report. They wouldn't not truck any dissent to their negotiation leverage. The Commission cynically weaponised this issue.

There simply isn't a frictionless border. That's like hot snow. If it existed, the UK would have been able to come up with one.

&gt;Well, if the EU had taken a more cooperative and less antagonistic approach, it's possible that Brexit wouldn't affect the peace process. But they were never interested in that, they wanted leverage and they wanted to punish the UK.

The EU is not out to ""punish the UK"". The fact that Brexit has negative consequences, isn't a ""punishment"", but a mechanical consequence of Brexit. You cannot have the freedom to set your own standards AND want seamless access to the Single Market. Those things are mechanically incompatble. 

&gt;EU will be forced to make concessions

Which concessions? An open border? That's not happening. The UK either stays alligned or border checks are required. In both directions!

Because that is an issue currently not addressed, the fantasy that the UK will never have to impose border procedures on its end. That will either lead to WTO littigation, or the demise of whole UK sectors.

&gt;Even on SPS checks, the EU could offer comprehensive mutual recognition, there is no reason not to given UK standards exceed the EU minimum, but they continue to insist that dynamic alignment is the only option - that's not being flexible, it's being impractical and difficult. It's entirely political and designed to coerce the UK into the EU's regulatory orbit.

No it can't. That is a fantasy. The products either comply with Eu standards or they don't. In a few cases, standards have common elements, but in others, they are mutually exclusive (example: EU and UK plugs can't be ""equivalent"")

MRA's exist, but only in limited fields (New Approach regulations), and definitely not in SPS. On top of that, the MRA doesnt apply on recognition of standards, it merely recognises that certain testing house can provide certificates that a product meets EU standards.

The more the UK diverges from the EU system (and the same is true for the EU), the more it will lose access to the Single Market. That is not punishment or petty EU, that is a mechanical consequence from that divergence.

&gt;UK is fine and the EU will continue work closely with us because we are integral the European security, intelligence and defense, and because we are the second largest economy in the region, 

Yes, both parties will need to collaborate, hence no need to spoil the relation by refusing to implement an agreement signed 3 months ago.

&gt;and because we are essential to the eurozone financial ecosystem

The source for the case data and positive testing data is here: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

The source for the vaccine data is here: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations

I've had requests for the spreadsheet, so here is the original as of 17th November: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HUFdsIJEXFPcawCd7KC1atBzuzf59bGkeJTJqnURTTk/edit?usp=sharing

The previous one as of 24th December: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZoutqwXmD-npnX_rRZh2Nxm6Sgwwbj8J/view?usp=sharing

The newest one as of 23rd March: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OeaQPQsABA6q1rLPriZ9bYjtM18z524y/view?usp=sharing

I won't be keeping these versions up to date but you can see how the data is entered and calculated. 

**Version Notes**

The ecdc stopped updating data on a daily basis as of 14th December. I figured weekly data wasn't particularly useful and while the worldometer data is not as accurate as an official agency, at least it is daily so people can make informed decisions about it. 

Just so you can see the extend of the variances, here is the data for the 12th, 13th and 14th of December between worldometer and ecdc: https://imgur.com/Y71Nx7o

Some of this will be due to delays in data reporting and methodologies, others will be the source. In order to do a more detailed comparison, you need to look at the data sources on the ecdc and worldometer sites.

The good news is that worldometer data allows me to look wider than just the UK and EU and also has up-to-date testing data, which allows for the positivity data to be more useful and match the case data in terms of time frame. 

I've added vaccination data as of 23 March 2021. This data is sourced separately and is also not always fully up to date - as such, there's a column which includes the data date. Note that I will be reporting as per the data collected by ""Our World in Data"". 

**Schedule**

I will post this chart daily (where possible) during the week, Monday to Friday but I will not update it at weekends because around half of the countries do not update their numbers over the weekend and also it's on a computer I would not otherwise be logging onto, unless there's something particularly notable which requires a weekend update.

**Explaining some numbers**

*What is the 7 day case rate?* 

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it.

The 7 day case rate number in the graph is the number of people in that stadium who would have a coronavirus infection a week later. For example, in the UK on the 8th November the number was 239.7. That means 240 out of 100,000 people in the stadium would have an infection the following week.

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the daily movement*

The daily movement numbers are just how the 7 day case rate is moving up and down each day. The 7 day trend is the most interesting number - it's the sum of all the ups and downs. If you think of the infection as a car then the 7 day case rate is the speed of the coronavirus infection and the 7 day trend is the acceleration (or deceleration) of the infection. If the 7 day trend is red it's accelerating, if it's neither red nor green it's holding steady and if it's green it means it's slowing down (note - a green 7 day rate doesn't mean the infection is shrinking, just that it's slowing down).

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*How can I tell if the infection is shrinking*

You can't infer that from this data, this data only looks and new cases and the rate of change in new cases. The other side of the equation is how many people are recovering from coronavirus in each country. If you think of it like a bath - this is how much water is flowing through the taps. You cannot tell how much water is going down the plughole so you can't tell how much water is in the bath (i.e. the infection level).

*What is testing rate per 100,000?*

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it.

The testing rate is how many of those 100,000 people will have received a coronavirus test in a 7 day period. 

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the positive test rate*

This is the % of tests taken which are coming back positive. The WHO says countries should aim for this to be 3% or lower and that testing not keeping up with infections if the rate is above 10%. If you don't have enough tests, you restrict access to them to people who are more likely to be infected either by their symptoms or their risk of exposure, and that inflates your numbers.

This number is a ratio of tests completed, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 3% adjusted case rate*

Used to be the 10% rate but has been rebased around 3%. There is also a lower limit at 1% where the impact will be reduced by a factor of 5. 

Countries with a higher positivity rate are not testing enough of their population, so this multiplies their most recent day's case rate by a factor of their positivity rate divided by 3% - for example on 6th April Greece's positivity rate was 6% so their daily case rate was multiplied by 6%/3% = 2

**This is not** an estimate of the true scale of the pandemic within the country** but is a proxy to rank countries by accounting for countries who are showing a lower positive case rate because they're not doing enough testing.

This number accounts for population size AND level of testing within a country, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 7 Day Vaccines per 100,000?*

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it. This is the number of people in the stadium who would have received a vaccine dose of that stadium in a 7 day period. 

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 1st Dose %*

This is the % of a population who have received their first vaccine dose. It covers total population which includes children so will be lower than the number some sources cite (% of adult population)

*What is the 2nd Dose %*

This is the % of a population who have received all of their vaccine doses to be considered vaccinated (includes single dose vaccines like J&amp;J)

**What are the marks out of 10**

A formula gives every country a score between 1 and 11 for how bad their 10% adjusted case rate is and multiples it by the 1st dose %. The higher the better. 

For the graph on 22nd March, Estonia, at the top of the chart, gets a score of 1; Iceland, at the bottom of the chart, gets a score of 11. Everybody else gets a score somewhere in between. It then multiplies this by 2/3 of the total doses of vaccines given. Since no country has a vaccine rate greater than 90% it is effectively a score between 1 and 10.

What does it mean? It's a score as to how well the country is managing the pandemic - when the score gets close to 10 this means they have very low infection rates and very high vaccination rates. 

This number accounts for population size AND level of testing AND vaccine rates within a country, so you can compare country-by country

**Why sort by the 10% Adjusted Rate?**

Look at Poland on 9th November as an example - their actual 7 day rate was not actually much higher than the UK's (200 vs 160) and is lower than Denmark's (221), but their positive test rate is 49% - basically 1 out of 2 tests came back positive compared to 5% for UK and 2% for Denmark. Poland only test a fraction of their population compared to the UK or Denmark (706  vs 3198 / 8658 per 100,000) so their actual rate of infection is going to be much higher - their 7 day rate is just kept artificially low by the amount of tests they're (not) doing.

The 10% Adjusted Rate accounts for this. 

This method is **not perfect** as countries account for positivity differently. For instance, some countries (e.g. UK, Italy) include lateral flow tests in overall testing rates and positivity whereas other countries (e.g. Germany) only include PCR so their rates will appear higher and testing rates will appear lower. In addition, countries may alter the way they account for things. While it's important to use this metric to help smooth out countries not doing enough testing, remember that it's not perfect and doesn't tell the full story. 

There is no one unbiased source and you should seek to get your information from a range of sources and assess the underlying bias in the information you're reading and the possible agenda that source may have.

**Why is X country not on the list? / Why is this EU-centric / There are non-EU countries above the total**

I originally did refer to this as EU rather than Europe and I had a lot of comments from people about their country being in the data but them not being in the EU. So I removed any reference to the EU. Since then I've had increasing numbers of comments about why this is EU-centric. To be clear - countries above the grey line aren‚Äôt just EU, the reason they‚Äôre above the line is because they were the countries tracked by the ecdc which was the original source of the data.

Since December I‚Äôve had to switch to using worldometer as the ecdc only provide weekly data. As such I added a small basket of additional countries but I added these below the line, because I wanted the data to be comparable for people looking pre- and post- ecdc data. The countries in the basket were those most commonly requested. The only limitation I have is that I need to be able to fit the screenshot on one page. The total number of lines available is 41, so I don‚Äôt have enough lines for all 48-51 European countries (depending on where you draw the line on Europe and which states you recognize). 

Regardless of how I cut this, it seems it‚Äôs going to annoy somebody. But if you have a country that you feel should be represented that isn't and there's enough demand for it, I'm happy to see what I can accommodate.","British, spiritual EU citizen in exile due to Brexit üôÅ",/r/europe/comments/o1y7rv/7_day_case_rate_positivity_rate_serious_case_rate/h23ahnv/,sonicandfffan,1623939156
4590,"I don‚Äôt understand. Perhaps you could try to explain.

Which bit of what I said isn‚Äôt true and is proNazi propaganda? 

1. The massacres in Latvia were carried out by a Nazi unit *with* help from Latvians *after* the Soviet invasion in the OP (And I have *still* yet to see you have the strength of character to admit that your original comment was incorrect in its timeline.)

2. That there were indeed many instances of fascist support among the local populations of these ( Baltic /Eastern) states that included taking part in massacres? 

3. That the *Soviets also* committed massacres in these states after invading them which is relevant to the OP which was about Russia. Though not in the same way as the Holocaust but real event when you want to talk about massacres. 

4. That the event in the OP took place while the Soviets were allied to the Nazis that you rightly claim it was terrible for Latvians to ally with! 


Your historical perspective that apparently no geographical area deserves democracy or self determination unless they have *always* been independent seems a bit weird - I have feeling that this would include most of Europe at one point of another. Weirdly, this is similar to the Nazi arguments for why large chunks of Europe should revert to them ‚Ä¶.. hmmm. 

And though people and their right to self determination obviously mean nothing to you, well it seems like the Latvians care! And the families of those who the Russian proceeded to murder and deport probably cared.  As do the populations they then continued to violently oppress for decades afterwards in the area. As did the women who their forces are well documented to have raped during ‚Äòliberations‚Äô. 

All in all I can‚Äôt help but think you make a very good example of the old saying about the left and right of a horse shoe bending back around to be indistinguishable. ‚ÄòPeople should have no right to self determination or democracy and deserve to submit or die‚Ä¶‚Äô doesn‚Äôt sound very *anti* Nazi to me.

Greater London and commuter towns account for nearly 20% of the entire UK population, and EU nationals are disproportionately represented within the capital. 

&gt; if they are so young (and therefore fit), how come you brexiteers targeted EU citizens when complaining about NHS queues? Young people do not need that much healthcare.

I'm not a brexiteer... and don't agree with their premises regarding immigration, but young or not, more people means more healthcare demand. And the fact is that NHS funding (for whatever reason) struggled to keep up with the growing population (which was driven mainly by EU migration).

&gt; Actually, unless you are BAME yourself, you won't know what it feels like to be treated differently because of your origins.

Do you realise BAME is a meaningless and, in many ways, offensive term?

For example, there are huge differences in outcomes between black people of Carribean origin and black people of African origin, and that's because people who moved to the UK from Africa generally have had to jump over much higher hurdles, they tend to be skilled professionals and middle class.

Institutional racism does exist, but many of the claims of the UK's 'variant' of BLM are hugely exaggerated.

And if you think the England riots of 2011 can be neatly explained by racism, you are too ignorant of that event to hold a opinion worth listening too.

&gt; But sure, keep telling to yourself that UK is better than almost everywhere in the EU. 

I don't have to tell myself, the data speaks for itself. Meanwhile you keep telling yourself the UK is racist based on feels. I wonder whether you know that in a Pew poll done in 2018, Italy was found to be the most racist country in Western Europe...",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/o1s2il/number_of_eu_citizens_seeking_work_in_uk_falls_36/h22w451/,MyFavouriteAxe,1623931432

I'm sorry, but while in Finland I have to enact the policy of do not drink coffee outside of my house, unless it was a kind of emergency. Tea was also really bad, even making foam sometimes.

4702,"No - the Western Allies did not have non aggression pacts with Germany. 

On Munich, I would first point out that the UK had no treaty commitments to Czechoslovakia - France and the USSR did. 

Munich was a betrayal but the difference is that they were trying to resolve what was considered a legitimate German grievance (the 3 million Sudeten Germans who were outside the German state). They did not make the deal at Munich for their own territorial gain or enrichment. The worst that can be said of Munich is that it was Britain and France delaying war with Germany by sacrificing Czechoslovakia's independence. And it was one country, not the half dozen which the USSR invaded in collusion with the Nazis. It was wrong headed and futile at its aim at avoiding war and satisfying Hitler, but it was nothing like the Nazi Soviet Pact.

And as AJP Taylor pointed out - Britain and France sold out the Czechs and they experienced about half a million dead in the war, with relatively light damage done to the country itself. Britain and France took a stand over Poland and guaranteed it against Hitler's aggression. Poland then saw 6 million or more war dead, and total devastation to the country (especially Warsaw).

Tankie:

A hardline Stalinist. A tankie is a member of a communist group or a ""fellow traveller"" (sympathiser) who believes fully in the political system of the Soviet Union and defends/defended the actions of the Soviet Union and other accredited states (China, Serbia, etc.) to the hilt, even in cases where other communists criticise their policies or actions. For instance, such a person favours overseas interventions by Soviet-style states, *defends these regimes when they engage in human rights violations*, and wishes to establish a similar system in other countries such as Britain and America. 

‚Ä¶

The term derives from the fact that the divisions within the communist movement first arose when the Soviet Union sent tanks into communist Hungary in 1956, *to crush an attempt to establish an alternative version of communism which was not embraced by the Russians*. Most communists outside the eastern bloc opposed this action and criticised the Soviet Union. The ""tankies"" were those who said ""send the tanks in"".",,/r/europe/comments/o1r4r5/81_years_ago_on_this_day_latvia_was_invaded_by/h22m9gt/,Mkwdr,1623924136

They arent the boss of the pharma companies, they are the customer that paid for their order and was impatiently waiting at the door to receive their delivery.

Also when you consider that the whole bottleneck in this situation is the product itself (demand is higher than the supply), then it's better to have a single organisation lead the discussions with the pharma companies in order to not be taken advantage of and to avoid bidding wars between countries.

The companies know what they are doing, but they are also working to fulfill contracts, in which they overpromised and under delivered. AZ is a prime example. They knew that there was a risk that they couldn't scale up production in time and successfully, but still signed conflicting contracts with the UK and EU, and then made a business decision to provide to the UK instead of the EU.

Right now the consensus is mostly that each country has a list of other states with various requirements for them to fullfil (e.g. From Spain to someplace requires a negative PCR test).

After 1st of July an agreement has been reached that either a vaccine, a negative PCR or the confirmation that you already had the disease will suffice throughout the EU. Other then that there's always the quarantine (or isolation) alternative. Which is still ""free-movement"" since you're still allowed in the country.

The only exception to this are countries which shut down and limit movement to their own citizens (it makes sense, right? if your citizens aren't free to move -- foreigners also) or people that have Covid which won't be allowed in another country.

P.S. I'm also eager for this to be over and complete freedom of movement to be in place.

My main issue/gripe with buying from the EU is not entirely the price to be fair, it is still availability and shipping. I am involved in a number of niche hobbies and a lot of items that are required are either not stocked anywhere in the EU or are at a ridiculous premium, but what is even more ridiculous is the shipping. For how much we talk about how we are supposed to be a unified market and globalized I am constantly faced with the dreaded 'We do not ship to your country', so you are telling me that I can buy a ticket for a boat and be in your country by the end of the day but you won't ship me ship a package? Ok fine I will just buy from a Chinese factory who never seem to have a problem to ship it to me from the other side of the planet.

Look familiar? Chinese wave power device is suspiciously similar to a Scottish machine made at factory where laptops were stolen after visit by Beijing officials five years ago

The Chinese government visited a Scottish renewable energy manufacturer in 2011 after expressing an interest in their innovative new prototype product which used ocean waves to create electricity.  
  
Two months later, the plant suffered a burglary where laptops were stolen after the culprits scaled a perimeter fence.  
  
But suspicions were aroused when the burglar or burglars headed straight for the first floor office of Pelamis Wave Power, neglecting to take anything from the ground floor office of tech giant Siemens

Pelamis Wave Power went into administration in 2014 with the loss of their 16 remaining staff from an original 50 at its peak.  
  
In 2004, its wave machine became the first to generate electricity into the grid.  
  
A number of former employees have now questioned the arrival of the 60-strong Chinese party in 2011 ‚Äì who were treated to dinner and whiskey tasting at Edinburgh Castle ‚Äì and their subsequent trustworthiness.

'It was a tremendous feather in our cap to be the only place in the UK outside of London that the Chinese vice-premier visited.  
  
'We did have a break-in about 10 weeks after, when a number of laptops were stolen.  
  
'It was curious that whoever broke in went straight to our office on the second floor rather than the other company on the first floor or the ground floor.'

The union was not quite continuous; there were several short interruptions. Legally, the countries remained separate sovereign states. However, their domestic and foreign policies were directed by a common monarch.

Here in the US, joining the military is incentivized in a number of ways. If your goal is to go to medical school or law school, the government will pay for you to go to school (if you're accepted into a program) and give you a stipend for living expenses, room and board, and so on the entire time you're in school. Then, you have to serve x years as an officer in the role you went to school for. I believe it's around 6 years of active-duty service for medical doctors and lawyers followed by y years of reserve-duty service where you're called up if we go to war or something. If you go to medical school or law school on the military's dime, you can get out of the military and start your own practice debt free in your early 30s. That debt would easily be in the $100,000.00+ range. If you're still attending a university, you can join an ROTC program and get similar benefits while you're in school contingent on you serving as an officer once you graduate. There aren't many officer jobs that require one specific focus of study, so a bachelor's degree could land you in any of a large number of positions. That includes fighter pilot in the USAF and US Navy/Marines. Officers are paid a decent salary in addition to all medical expenses being paid for you and your family. 

The officer side of things isn't nearly as incentivized, though. The US military is a gigantic upward-mobility vehicle for the poor. They certainly suffer the most when we're warring, but it also offers them opportunities they absolutely would not have otherwise. For example, a friend of mine grew up extremely poor. I'm talking these people had dirt floors in their house outside of the bedrooms. Their parents made almost no money and my friend and his brothers were first-generation Americans as their parents were from Mexico. Every single one of them enlisted in the military. He went from having nothing and living in an area of the country where there are no real job opportunities to earning a salary and having full-coverage medical insurance. He also gained access to lending resources provided by the military which allowed him to purchase a home for his parents that was closer to town and had tiled floors throughout as well as a new vehicle for himself. Sure, he got stuck in a crappy town in the middle of nowhere for around 10 years working as a jet-engine mechanic, but he stuck it out. He eventually got the chance to ""retrain"" for another role in the US Airforce. Now he's been living with his wife and kids in Okinawa for around 5 years. He was able to bring his parents out to visit Japan. These people went from dirt floors to visiting Japan! You are eligible to retire from the branches of the US Military after 20 years of service. Once you retire, you retain medical benefits for yourself and your family for the rest of your lives. You also receive a salary that is based on your ranking when you retired. My friend joined immediately after high school, so he will be 38 when he gets out. He already has a job lined up that'll utilize the skills he gained during his time in the service, so he'll be receiving a salary for his public-sector job on top of the retirement pay he gets from the US Military. That's not such a bad spot to be in at that age with a wife and kids. The same can be said for all of his brothers. Not all of them stayed in the service until they could retire, but all of them gained significant upward mobility as a result of their service. 

Sorry, that ended up being way longer than I originally anticipated. Best of luck.",,/r/europe/comments/o17266/germany_has_recalled_a_platoon_from_a_nato/h21yic9/,pedantic_merrygolds,1623904881

5089,"The British government has agreed to introduce an Irish language act in Northern Ireland if the Stormont Assembly fails to do so by the end of September.

The move ends a dispute over the promised legislation which had threatened to derail attempts to get the Stormont Assembly back up and running.

Northern Secretary Brandon Lewis said he was pleased to announce that he DUP and Sinn Fein had agreed to nominate first and deputy first ministers ""at the earliest opportunity.""

That is expected to happen later today, meaning the Executive will be restored four days after Arlene Foster resigned as First Minister.

The breakthrough has been welcomed by the Taoiseach.

""The stability of the Northern Ireland Executive and the full operation of all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement are critical for the peace and security of the people of Northern Ireland, and for all the people of these islands,"" Micheal Martin said in a statement.

Sinn Fein had asked the British government to go over the heads of the Assembly and introduce the legislation.

The party said it would not go back into power sharing with the DUP unless it had a firm commitment on such legislation, but the DUP had indicated it could not commit to a definite timetable.

Brandon Lewis held separate meetings with Sinn Fein and the DUP at Stormont last night. Both delegations left without speaking to the media.

A Sinn Fein delegation including party President Mary Lou McDonald, it's leader in Northern Ireland Michelle O'Neill and its chief negotiator Conor Murphy returned to Stormont shortly before midnight.

A short time later, Mary Lou McDonald announced in a post on Twitter that ""the British Govt has tonight agreed to legislate for Acht Gaelige.

I like that you're fine with illegal occupation and planting of mines on stolen land with intention of killing locals if they ever try to return, with current witholding of maps in deliberate attempt to get more Azeris killed, but when it comes to POWs you're super concerned about laws and legality of things.

Armenia is the one that needed the ceasefire, not Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has zero motivation to uphold the ceasefire and it's terms if Armenia keeps acting hostile towards Azerbaijan and presents an threat to Azerbaijani citizens, which it does by intentionally witholding the maps in hopes to get more Azeris killed for no reason, and if ceasefire fails it won't be a problem for Azeris, but will be a massive problem for Armenians.

The area was done clearing and was presumed to be safe, but apparently wasn't. You know why they missed a mine? Precisely, cause they didn't have the goddamn maps!

Armenia holds onto the maps as a bargaining chip because otherwise it will have nothing to offer in negotiations, so Azerbaijan holds onto the POWs as a bargaining chip because it doesn't want to lose it's cards either. In both cases, human lives are at stake while politicians bicker.

However if someone breaks the law to gather the evidence (a police officer breaking into a property without authority or a criminal finding it and handing it on) they obviously should still face whatever consequences are appropriate. 

Obviously you do need safeguards to ensure that the evidence is sound, and that can be harder with illegally obtained evidence, and state bodies should face consequences where they break the law, especially if there are alternatives.  We shouldn't be encouraging the police or other investigators not to comply with the law when obtaining evidence after all.

In general both were totalitarian systems with similar propaganda/personality cult/concentration camps etc. You may ask now why communism turned out in USSR the way it turned out? Answer is that there was no democratic support for their policies like collectivization that is directly related to deportations and thus they had to use force.

5534,"You're completely missing my point. I'm not at all saying Wilhelm II was THE reason Germany ended up in unwinnable World Wars. It's very true what you say, German upper class, the influence of the military, her geographic positioning etc ALL pointed Germany to the path of militarism and therefore war. 

What I'm saying is he was a *catalyst*, as in the chemical sense : 

""\[A catalyst is\] a substance added to speed up a chemical process"". 

Willy is the substance and Germany losing and being reduced to her current borders is the chemical process. He didn't singlehandedly cause it, not at all. But he played his part. 

It should be said though, Willy definitely is a big victim of history, if Germany had won WW1, he would be seen as a great victor, the man who through bold action and strength gained the European hegemony and place in the sun Germany so desperately craved (and needed, in the case of continental European hegemony). 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;France and Britain relations started warming up way before Wilhelm came into power.

Correct, Crimean war for example. But warmer relations between France and Britain isn't necessarily a threat to Germany, it's the alliance between the two nations that could and would threaten German sovereignty, which was a process that was hastened exactly because of the Anglo-German naval arms race, which Wilhelm was a big supporter of.",,/r/europe/comments/o0867w/on_this_day_1888_emperor_frederick_iii_died_after/h1ztqrn/,NealVertpince,1623866633

I don't care, not all nats are SNP supporters. 

&gt;That's the crux, uneducated people like yourself putting people in boxes, to make it easier to be abusive.

But I've not though, I've made an effort to distinguish between Scotnats and Unionists I didn't blanket all Scots as independence supporters. 

&gt;I see you are threatening to do what the EU wants to do Britain because of Brexit, you can't make it up.

You mean not being entitled to the benefits of membership of a Union? Why wouldn't they? 

&gt;I have never once claimed we will sell you water, only we have it in abundance. Stop making shit up, it makes you look foolish.

I never said you would sell us water genius, I said the logical conclusion would be to sell it to us because its the easiest way to get money to sell water at scale. 

&gt;You can't win cause you won't listen. Imagine if the nuclear deterrent was parked next to London. That wouldn't be popular. Well guess what, it's unpopular having it next to the largest population base in Scotland.

We can't win because even when we listen you're never satisfied. Faslane is **85 miles** away from Edinburgh and **40 miles** from Glasgow, but irrespective of that, park them in England it's not a big deal, it just sends the jobs and all the investment for the Faslane area south.

&gt;Stop conflating independence with the SNP. There are many that want independence but hate the SNP. Your ignorance will only lead to more voting for them. People like you are a joke. 

Nah what's humourous is you being unable to fathom that Scottish independence, as it currently is as a proposition, wouldn't be anywhere near where it is now without the organisation of the SNP, despite their flaws. 

&gt;Please do what you want, when it comes to borders. Just pay us a big huge chunk of money as a divorce settlement and we will happily leave idiots like you to your outdated dreams, the world has moved on, apart from inbreds like you.

We both have the Assassins and the Templars here.

The Templars, although in the whole of Europe we're rounded up and executed, in Portugal existed until the 18th century (with the secularization of the Order).
In 1314, the Order of Christ, created by King Dinis of Portugal, gave lands and the riches the Templar had to them... The members of this new Order were Templars.

Lisbon is the capital of the Muslim sect whose ancestors created the infamous Assassins. Their current leader was awarded an Order of Christ medal.

&gt;ridiculous amount of tax spent on defense



The ¬£3.4b allocated defence spending isn't using any of Scottish tax payers money but instead part of the ¬£15.1b deficit the rUK pays for. So if Scotland went independent you would just lose the defence budget you wouldn't gain anything.

The growth report also calculated that Scotland would need to spend about 1.6% of GDP for it's army, so about ¬£2.7b. That means an independent Scotland has knocked off ¬£0.7b from its fiscal deficit (interest on national debt counters it).

5667,"Germany withdraws platoon from Nato mission in Lithuania

Germany has recalled a platoon from a Nato mission in Lithuania after reports emerged of troops engaging in racist and anti-Semitic behaviour, as well as sexual assault.

The allegations were first published by Der Spiegel news magazine on Monday.

Announcing the decision on Twitter, German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said the misconduct would be ""punished with all severity"".

Four German soldiers were initially withdrawn as part of the investigation.

The troops were in Lithuania as part of Nato's ""enhanced forward presence"", a mission which trains local soldiers as a deterrent against Russian in a number of Eastern European countries.

""The misconduct of some soldiers in Lithuania is a slap in the face of everyone who works in the Bundeswehr \[German army\] day after day to serve the security of our country,"" Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer tweeted on Wednesday.

She said the entire platoon would be withdrawn with ""immediate effect"", and that any necessary investigations and proceedings would take place in Germany.

On Tuesday, the minister said that any soldiers who knew about the incidents but did not report them would also face punishment.

According to Der Spiegel, the allegations relate to a party held at a hotel in Lithuania at the end of April.

**A number of troops are suspected of bullying, threatening violence, filming an incident of sexual assault against another soldier, as well as singing anti-Semitic songs.**

**Separate allegations later emerged of sexual and racial abuse within the platoon, while some soldiers reported that a number of people sang a song to mark Adolf Hitler's birthday on 20 April, according to Der Spiegel.**

The German government has had to take action against suspected extremism in the armed forces on at least two occasions in recent years.

Last year, Defence Minister Kramp-Karrenbauer ordered the partial dissolution of the elite KSK commando force after 20 of its members were suspected of right-wing extremism.

On Tuesday however, German media quoted her as saying the KSK would not be completely disbanded following a year of reforms.

In 2017 meanwhile, inspections were ordered on all German military barracks after Nazi-era memorabilia was found at two of them.

German police forces have also faced controversies over extremism within their ranks.

Last week, the state of Hesse dissolved the elite police force in Germany's second city of Frankfurt after a number of officers were found to be involved in extreme right-wing chat groups, which included swastikas and images of Hitler.

A local official confirmed on Tuesday that a total of 49 current members of police forces in the state were found to be members of the chats.",,/r/europe/comments/o17266/germany_has_recalled_a_platoon_from_a_nato/h1zdv5u/,redwhiterosemoon,1623859813

5720,"&gt;No, they were not in a warzone. The airspace that is not restricted is not part of the warzone, otherwise it would be closed.

They were in a war zone, and airspace restrictions have nothing to do with that. 

It's a mistake of the Ukrainian side not to close airspace over a war zone, but the fact that they allowed civilian planes inside a war zone does not mean it's not a war zone.

&gt;If a murder has been committed with a certain weapon, and camera footage shows a guy in the area walking with that weapon, that would suggest that that person is the murderer. Understand?

That is ignoring how military logistics actually work. I think even the Dutch acknowledge that it isn't likely that any of these people pulled the trigger. 

So the question is, if we're treating this as plain old murder (which is ridiculous itself) why exactly is Girkin charged? He wasn't there. 

Why is a guy doing security for the convoy charged? He's not the one that operated the Buk?

&gt;The outcome isn‚Äôt fixed, the outcome is predictable

It's fixed, as there really is no way for anybody to defend themselves here, the table is stacked against them.

&gt;This practice might help people with contacts to access or receive a better public service. However, the resulting preferential treatment can prevent entire groups from accessing public services and skew the distribution of government services in favour of groups or individuals that are better connected in society and often more privileged in other ways.

IMO, it is very vague and wide. For example, when my husband got covid, I called a friend who is a doctor and he gave us some advice over the phone and emailed us a certificate (on his personal time). So I used a personal connection to get better public service I guess. Did it prevent anyone else from getting a service or put anyone at a disadvantage? I don't think so. On the contrary I think that by using a direct connection of someone who already knows us, it saved us some time and it also save some time to the medical professional(s) we would have seen instead.

**Berlin's interior minister wants to act faster against hatred and agitation on the Internet. Critics warn against undermining data protection.**

By Jan Drebes

In the future, social networks, messenger services and online gaming platforms will store the identities of their users. If these crimes are committed, the providers should hand over the data to the authorities. This is what Lower Saxony's Interior Minister Boris Pistorius (SPD) calls for and wants to introduce a bill to the Federal Council this Friday. ""It cannot be that people can hide behind fantasy names online and commit crimes without running a great risk of being punished,"" said Pistorius.

He does not require a so-called real name requirement. Users should be allowed to use pseudonyms in order to preserve their anonymity vis-√†-vis other users. However, the providers should know the true identities in order to be able to act more quickly against hatred and agitation. A reform of the Network Enforcement Act would be necessary.

""The previous investigations are taking too long and unfortunately only in a few cases have been successful,"" criticized Pistorius. ""I think that has led to apparently too many people thinking that they would simply get away with hatred or insults."" They are cases for the public prosecutor. With the law, Pistorius wants to force providers to check identity for all future registrations. Anyone who is already a user should be able to submit their data within two years. ‚ÄúTechnically, there are many ways to determine the identity. For example, by submitting an identification document to the post office or using a video-based process online, ‚Äùsaid Pistorius.

He sees the proposals as a good addition to the information obligation planned by Federal Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD), according to which online platforms must report legal violations. A corresponding law is on the way. There is no obligation to verify identity. Critics fear a threat to data protection.

Pistorius replied that data protection must be preserved. However, this should not de facto lead to criminal offenses being committed on the Internet without great risk.

Actually, that is exactly what the EU does. Do you have any idea how the EU works? Apparently not. If the ER didn't set the rules for member states, the UK would have had no reason to leave. The whole point of the EU is that it sets the rules that all member states have to follow. Does it always work? No, there are lots of breaches by all countries, some more, some less dramatic. But there is a reason why the EU takes member states to court.

As a reminder (since you didn't acknowledge these at all, despite this being your core point in the last point): ***You have the wrong understanding of what the core values of EU are.*** 

Here are the core values (again, this time without highlights, so you don't have a cause for whataboutery):
