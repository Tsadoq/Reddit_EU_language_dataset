&gt;But why don't you agree? What makes you disagree with something that hasn't been questioned until modernist and post-modernist theory? 

Why would I agree? Just because it has been along for a long time? Because a guy from 2000 years ago said so? 

&gt;If you want to beat your dick but father Francis says you'll go to hell for it, then your disagreement stems not only from guilt, but from arrogance.


Again you're parting from the false premise that the church has any capability of making me feel guilty about something. For me, and for most non religious people, what the church says has as much weight as the local book club says. Why would I feel guilty about what father Francis says? Does that mean I feel guilty about what my local barber says? Do you feel guilty about what a Iman or an orthodox priest says? What about the opinion of a Buddhist monk?

&gt;My question is, why do you disagree with &lt;enter Church teaching/dogma&gt;
Wll it depends on the dogma of course! It's not that I reject every thing the church says based on ""the church said it so I reject it"". It's rather that the church has as much weight as any random stranger.

Church says you should care about the environment? I agree! Probably for totally different reasons (as most teachings or dogmas have a direct link to the scriptures or God or something along those lines) but meh

The *allegation* that people would abuse a child.

It will be a fact officially after the trial. 

Again, no exceptions. It might look like it's clear cut after reading some short and sensationalised media reports, but public lynchings of suspects are never a good thing, regardless of crime and the strength of evidence.

Also, assuming they're guilty, what would publishing their faces *now* change? Everyone who might be even tangentially related to that case knows about it and has been on the mind of the investigators, so they can react to it as appropriate, and they don't need to see the faces of the suspects in the media.

395,"Short version: Switzerland played Serbia in the World Cup and the game has a lot of controversy.

Long version: (I'm gonna try to be objective, but I don't guarantee I will.)

Xhaka and Shaqiri play for Swiss national team. Their fathers are refugees from Albania/Kosovo and have quite a bad history with Serbs, to put it lightly. Since these two countries hate each other, fans of Serbia started booing anytime these two got to the ball.

Serbia went all in for the last few minutes, since the game was tied 1-1, and a draw would leave the same outcome for Serbia as a loss, so they had nothing to lose. While attacking, Shaqiri got the ball and scored from the counter-attack putting the score to 2-1. During his celebration he and Xhaka showed 'Albanian Eagle', which could translate to something as ""This is for Albania."" Considering the relationship between Serbia and Albania, this is strong, and can easily be considered as political. (I'd say it's definitely political, since they represent the Swiss team and not the Albanian or Kosovan one.)

Any political messages throughout World Cup matches are strictly forbidden by FIFA, though. Serbian and Mexican fans got fined earlier in the Cup for bringing politics into the game.

Considering Serbia got fined, people are curious if Xhaka, Shaqiri and/or Swiss federation get fined as well. I actually didn't find much about why Serbia got fined, supposedly there was some WWII motive, but I can't find an image. :/ (Just trust me (and FIFA, and people who know better than me) that there was something.)

I'm not gonna go through some weird calls that happened during the game, but a lot of controversy comes from there as well. (Shortly: Serbia getting yellow cards for everything, some Swiss fouls being missed, including the missed penalty that could've put Serbia into 2-1 lead.)

This all piled up and causes a huge shitstorm on /r/soccer now. (If you're going there, I recommend sorting by controversial.) ;)

Like the Dutch and even the Norwegians are examples of other modern non-German Germanic people. Just like the Franks werent German but were Germanic.

You're basically saying that this law is bad because some other law might have been bad. This makes no sense unless you actually comment on the text of the new law.

&gt; The semantics of the word ""parody"" is extremely important for determining whether or not something actually is parody. How else do we determine what constitutes parody?

&gt; Just because memes has been on the internet since its inception, they don't have to be legal. Links to copyrighted material has been on the internet forever too, and they're illegal.

They've been online for a long time because they are legal. There are court cases that have established precedents for this. [Here](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2016/09/parody-and-free-use-in-germany-federal.html)'s one from Germany.

&gt; The case was thus an opportunity for the German Federal Court to clarify how to handle parodies after the CJEU Dekcmyn decision. These are the main takeaways:

&gt; Even though free use covers more types of uses than parodies and is considered by many scholars to be an inherent limitation of copyright rather than an exception, the Federal Court argued convincingly that the way German courts handle parodies has the same effects that a proper parody exception would have.

The descendants of Sudeten Germans form a highly organized group of voters. It’s literally their raison d’être to keep the discord alive.

Politics. Sudeten German organizations (“Landsmannschaft”) have been affiliated with Merkel’s party for decades (in fact since they had a falling out with their earlier patron, the SPD). They vote C{D,S}U in exchange for support of their core positions. They are led by CSU functionary and, frankly, populist piece of shit, Mr. Posselt who – following the pattern of other nationalist assholes – secured himself an EU salary while working on undermining progress in Europe. Himself of course he wasn’t expelled simply due to the fact that he was born ten years too late, but that never kept anyone from claiming they’re part of the expelled.

802,"&gt;The false positives will cover a lot of things.

Why? Here's how I see it playing out:

- A certain group of copyright holders do not want derivative works of their content spread online. While I don't agree with this sentiment, I acknowledge that it exists. I doubt it's a very large group though. 
- As of yet, they have very little recourse to remove content from the internet.
- This proposed law changes that. They will have recourse to remove content and prevent it from being reuploaded.
- To prevent the reupload, a filter will need to be in place. Note that this filter, by design, will only catch reuploads. Therefore, content that does hold copyright but has no claims against it, can be uploaded unimpeded. 

Note that I don't think the law is a good idea. But I also think that the pushback against it is disproportionally large. I'm not opposed to copyright holders being able to protect their content and being able to set terms on its release.  However, much hinges on the implementation of the filter and how strict it will have to be.

I am also against this new law and that's why I believe we need a transparent and objective discussion about it.

Below are some of the most common misconceptions I've seen mentioned on reddit in the last few days.

##*1 - ""It's a censorship law.""*

No content can be removed or blocked on copyright grounds without right holders making valid take-down requests. Automated systems are meant to prevent re-uploads of the content that was already taken down via valid take-down requests.

Below from paragraph 7 from Article 13.

&gt; Rightholders shall **duly justify the reasons** for their **requests to remove or block** access to their specific works or other subject matter.

http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-8672-2018-INIT/en/pdf

Also, the law mandates for complaint systems so that users can challenge these take-down requests.

Below from paragraph 7 from Article 13.

&gt; the service provider shall put in place a complaint and redress mechanism that is available to users of the service in case of disputes over the application of the measures to their content. Complaints submitted under this mechanism shall be processed by the online content sharing service provider in cooperation with relevant rightholders within a reasonable period of time. Rightholders shall duly justify the reasons for their requests to remove or block access to their specific works or other subject matter.

##*2 - ""We will no longer be able to create or share memes.""*

Memes are protected under EU law as exceptions under the copyright directive.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Directive#Exceptions_and_limitations

&gt; Article 5(3) allows Member States to establish copyright exceptions to the Article 2 reproduction right and the Article 3 right of communication to the public in cases of:

&gt; **caricature, parody or pastiche,**

##*3 - ""Small sites and start-ups won't be able to implement it.""*

Below from paragraph 5 from Article 13.

&gt; The measures referred to in point (a) of paragraph 4 shall be effective and proportionate,
taking into account, among other factors:

&gt; (a) the nature and size of the services, in particular whether they are provided by a microenterprise or a small-sized enterprise within the meaning of Title I of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC,including and their audience;

[...]

&gt; As regards Article 13, the Presidency has worked to meet the demands of some Member States to address the specific situation of **micro and small enterprises** by making it clearer that **these enterprises could be subject to a lighter regime with regard to the measures to be implemented by in order to avoid liability**. The approach chosen is based on the existing notions on EU law of micro and small enterprises, in order to provide for more legal certainty to all sides. It is in particular clarified further under the proportionality provisions that one should, in particular, consider whether the online content sharing service provider is a micro or a small enterprise, as the latter cannot be expected to take measures that are as burdensome and costly as those taken by large companies.

[...]

&gt; In particular, small and micro enterprises as defined in Title I of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC, should be expected to be subject to less burdensome obligations than larger service providers.

##*4 - ""Sites will require licenses from content creators in order to allow users to post copyrighted materials.""*

The part that has got everyone up in arms is paragraph 1 from Article 13 that says

&gt; An online content sharing service provider shall obtain an authorisation from the rightholders
referred to in Article 3(1) and (2) of Directive 2001/29/EC in order to communicate or make
available to the public works or other subject matter. Where no such authorisation has been
obtained, the service provider shall prevent the availability on its service of those works and
other subject matter, including through the application of measures referred to in paragraph 4.

Like Switzerland and Norway?  

No, the EU doesn't want a border that infringes on its five freedoms, and it isn't in a position to mandate Ireland does the checking on its sea border.

This leaves three options: Customs deal, sea border to UK or Hard border(on both sides).

&gt;UK won't implement a sea border with NI, nor will they implement a hard border with ROI.

If it comes to no deal either the UK implements a hard border or goes customs free. There isn't another option.

&gt;ROI have stated that they will not implement a hard border with NI.

They will though even if they have to ask the EU to pay for it. 

&gt; It is only the EU that has a requirement for a border, due to the single market - external market frontier.

Without changing the status of Ireland or NI it is a WTO requirement that the EU are laying the groundwork for now.

The timing is very likely political and possibly hoping to spur the UK into action with getting a deal of some sort started, remember the deal has backstops so if nothing else it buys time, and from there hopefully soften the UK population enough to force a rejoining referendum.

884,"&gt; fleeing perfectly safe places within Europe for that sweet Germoney (proving a great deal are here for purely or primarily economic reasons).

It's as you say, many are fleeing safe places for economic reasons. Others are fleeing very dangerous places for extreme economic reasons. It's all on the same scale, as far as I'm concerned. Some groups ascribe value to medical care, some to food and others to continued breathing. Nobody, however, will undertake arduous journeys with an uncertain outcome for no reason at all. Oh right, that ""Germoney"" is all that's at work here... No nation state is handing out money and citizenship to anybody willy-nilly, but largely they offer just refuge. ""Germoney"" buys them safety and shelter, no matter the reason behind them needing that. Most will then even be sent back if they're actually from the safe places you mention.

&gt; As for the tired birth lottery argument, as much as you wish it to be, this is literally not a thing other than under several layers of conceptual abstraction to perpetuate and justify white guilt. 

Good lord, why is everything a racial thing to some people? 

&gt; it is the culmination of generations of ancestors hard work and suffering that we are alive today to reap the rewards of their and their countrymen's labor. 

It's refreshing to see somebody realizing that rewards reaped and country built in the past by earlier generations are still relevant. 
I'm personally a fan of the ""luck paradigm,"" but if you insist the past matters, why then would you use 'white guilt'? It's a phrase I only see seriously used by people who hold no stock in considerations about where inherited wealth came from, just that it's there and therefore theirs. Either it matters where it came from (and still comes from) or it doesn't. Either the past is relevant to the discussion or it isn't. 

The latter position is rationally preferable IMHO, but if you dislike thinking of yourself as 'lucky' and rather the product of the blood and sweat of ancestors you may not enjoy it all that much. Still though, if you go with calling yourself lucky, it's a lot easier to see all people as people and to keep historical/economical context in mind. 

&gt; you can create the most fantastical conceptualization of the ideal system to disperse migrants. 

Damn straight and the system itself also - but it better be fantastic enough to convince people. I'll grant you that  effective organization will be a nightmare, especially considering the panicky political situation, but not doing something solely because it's hard doesn't seem like a right approach to things. Also, it would definitely be in the interest of those in control, but it would vary per nation. Germany's people in control may love an efficient EU system, I'm guessing. The systems in each nation, in the meantime, will be as good as they can make them, for efficiency's sake. This makes it seem like there's interest.  

As for incentives, you seem to be concerned about people *knowing* that Germany will give asylum to only a few. Say, for instance, that all people knew that EU nations offered mere refuge to all but a few, would you then be okay with the general underlying concept of accepting refugees and giving them asylum if they need it? It's a perfect world scenario, but assume that everybody is aware, that purely-economic migrants are a rarity and that all money spared on processing is spent on educating people about EU policy, what do you think then?

* Tymoshenko is foolish to answer RT's question on was that real. She answers that she indeed talked to Shufrich but never said what's on tape. RT releases article captioned ""Tymoshenko confirms tape is real"".

1001,"&gt;My theory is that the politicians know the social structures of the west will collapse in a few years. Why? Because westerners do nto want to have children. So nobody will be there to pay the taxes and the huge pension funds they would expect when the yretire.

You actually think people who can't fulfill legal labor migration criterias will actually pay taxes and pension contributions? Nope. Most of them will not get legal employment and those who will get it (low skill jobs) make less than population on average. That also mean they also consume goverment services and income transfers.

If aging population wrecks economy, taking migrants wrecks it even more.

The economy would be better without them.

&gt;If you see a problem with the current migration system, literally the best way to fight it is to have 2+ children and raise them right. Remove the need of the constant wave after wave migration and the politicians will sotp it.

Nope, the best way is to oppose it politically. The boat migration needs to be stopped, completely.

Solution to systems which cannot handle low/negative population growth is to change them (for example pension cuts or retirement age increases). The need for it will happen even quicker with migrants, since they deteriorate government finances.

Unneeded population growth destroys environment and should not be promoted.

Yeah, I understand the politics-related issue, I guess politics here is simply very different from Canada and that's why you can easily hear things that would be offensive in Canada but are mainstream/popular opinions in Romania (I'm sure you have had people telling you  something that sounds very offensive towards Gypsies, for example).

And also the way politics is generally conducted is quite different, we tend to look way less at political ideologies and more at the people, so you end up with people fighting over politicians/cliques (""X was a crook!"" ""He wasn't perfect, but Y and his friends were the ones who raised taxes"" ""Z is friends with the oligarchs"") rather than issues.

But then, I really suggest not to emphasize politics too much when making friends, they can be nice people even if we redditors don't agree with their political views or even if you wouldn't agree with them if you were fully informed about Romanian politics either.

1079,"I've seen a lot of vague statements and fear mongering so far and very little actual discussions on what the law actually says.

I am also against this new law and that's why I believe we need a transparent and objective discussion about it.

Below are some of the most common misconceptions I've seen mentioned on reddit in the last few days.

##*1 - ""It's a censorship law.""*

No content can be removed or blocked on copyright grounds without right holders making valid take-down requests. Automated systems are meant to prevent re-uploads of the content that was already taken down via valid take-down requests.

Below from paragraph 7 from Article 13.

&gt; Rightholders shall **duly justify the reasons** for their **requests to remove or block** access to their specific works or other subject matter.

http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-8672-2018-INIT/en/pdf

Also, the law mandates for complaint systems so that users can challenge these take-down requests.

Below from paragraph 7 from Article 13.

&gt; the service provider shall put in place a complaint and redress mechanism that is available to users of the service in case of disputes over the application of the measures to their content. Complaints submitted under this mechanism shall be processed by the online content sharing service provider in cooperation with relevant rightholders within a reasonable period of time. Rightholders shall duly justify the reasons for their requests to remove or block access to their specific works or other subject matter.

##*2 - ""We will no longer be able to create or share memes.""*

Memes are protected under EU law as exceptions under the copyright directive.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Directive#Exceptions_and_limitations

&gt; Article 5(3) allows Member States to establish copyright exceptions to the Article 2 reproduction right and the Article 3 right of communication to the public in cases of:

&gt; **caricature, parody or pastiche,**

##*3 - ""Small sites and start-ups won't be able to implement it.""*

Below from paragraph 5 from Article 13.

&gt; The measures referred to in point (a) of paragraph 4 shall be effective and proportionate,
taking into account, among other factors:

&gt; (a) the nature and size of the services, in particular whether they are provided by a microenterprise or a small-sized enterprise within the meaning of Title I of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC,including and their audience;

[...]

&gt; As regards Article 13, the Presidency has worked to meet the demands of some Member States to address the specific situation of **micro and small enterprises** by making it clearer that **these enterprises could be subject to a lighter regime with regard to the measures to be implemented by in order to avoid liability**. The approach chosen is based on the existing notions on EU law of micro and small enterprises, in order to provide for more legal certainty to all sides. It is in particular clarified further under the proportionality provisions that one should, in particular, consider whether the online content sharing service provider is a micro or a small enterprise, as the latter cannot be expected to take measures that are as burdensome and costly as those taken by large companies.

[...]

&gt; In particular, small and micro enterprises as defined in Title I of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC, should be expected to be subject to less burdensome obligations than larger service providers.

##*4 - ""Sites will require licenses from content creators in order to allow users to post copyrighted materials.""*

The part that has got everyone up in arms is paragraph 1 from Article 13 that says

&gt; An online content sharing service provider shall obtain an authorisation from the rightholders
referred to in Article 3(1) and (2) of Directive 2001/29/EC in order to communicate or make
available to the public works or other subject matter. Where no such authorisation has been
obtained, the service provider shall prevent the availability on its service of those works and
other subject matter, including through the application of measures referred to in paragraph 4.

1082,"&gt; I'm pretty sure, however, that this instance really is just unnecessary. The piracy scare, for example, has caused people to try to hide what media they use. Without that, music producers would have much better data on what people actually listen to, and what they want to listen to even when it's not pushed throught the traditional sales channels that are measured. We could have a practically free peer-to-peer distribution network for data, if all the locks and keys to allow copyright owners to profit from it were removed.

As I said before, I'm of the same mind as you are on these issues.  
Still, as long as the interpretation of copyright is this and people work around that, we're gonna need systems that are efficient at defending it, and this is a modern system that is built following the nature of the internet.

&gt;  
&gt;On the other hand, I am glad we lost. The world the Germans (and Austrians!) envisioned would have no place for me.

This is an important aspect that one should not forget when discussing WW2, especially the Eastern Front. What happened to all those involved is absolutely horrible - no matter if they were a Jewish family, German soldier, Polish civilian, Belorussian villagers. The period around the war was the absolute lowest of the low in our common European modern history - and we should never forget the ills of extremist ideologies and of the principles inhumanity itself - because the war was won by extreme inhumanity. Firebombing of Germany and Soviet actions towards those in Eastern Europe and in Germany itself is just as inexcusable as the actions of the Nazis, and were grievous crimes against humanity committed under the guise of righteous revenge.

At least for me, personally, reading about the Holocaust and the war itself has completely shaped my own personal ideology of being anti-violence, anti-torture, anti-death penalty and so on. I hope there is never another major war in Europe, and I hope those responsible for dragging Europeans into modern wars - the American and British neo-cons, Serbian mass murderers, the current Russian administration - will face justice some day equal to that of the Nuremberg trails.

Of course, they would never admit their own wrongdoing, that the project of borderless (including outer border-less) Europe is not working, and that the backlash is here to come.

Firstly, it's not Germany who subsidizes Poland et al, it's EU.

1129,"&gt;Face it, the mainland campaign in western Europe was not an effort to beat the Reich. It was a race by the old colonial powers, assisted by the US, to push the Reich back in time to keep the eastern front from reaching their countries, and to potentially seize Berlin first to claim victory. Although, as one of the former allies shows these days, they didn't even have to do that to claim credit.

Your tone makes it sound like it was a bad thing they did this. The ''old colonial powers'' saved half of Europe from the mass murder and terror that the Soviets brought after the defeat of the Nazis.  The Western Front was an effort to beat the Nazis in Europe, and it resulted in the actual liberation of, at the very least, half of Europe, which is still better than the inhumane Soviet regime ruling from Paris to Moscow.

Iohannis was the president of PNL, the main opposition party, but just for a short period before he was elected president of Romania. It's true that PNL also has some shady figures and it's a party I would hardly bring myself to vote for, but their level of corruption is considerably lower than that of PSD in general and especially than Dragnea's (and they have also never tried to undermine the justice system to save their asses as Dragnea does/did.

*“I believe now that Hitler and the German people did not want war.  But we declared war on Germany intent on destroying it, in accordance with our principle of balance of power and we were encouraged by the ‘Americans around Roosevelt (Zionists).’  We ignored Hitler’s pleadings not to enter the war.  Now we are forced to realize that Hitler was right”  -   Attorney-General Sir Hartley Shawcross- March 16, 1984 – the lead British prosecutor at the Nuremberg War Crimes tribunal.*

Germany issued debt-free and interest-free money from 1935 on, which accounts for Germany's startling rise from the depression to a world power in five years. The German government financed its entire operations from 1935 to 1945 without gold, and without debt.  It took the entire Capitalist and Communist world to destroy the German revolution, and bring Europe back under the heel of the banking cartel , who became the richest on the planet with Tipu Sultan’s gold in 1799.

&gt;&gt;In July, the Perm court sentenced Luzgin to a 200,000 fine, having found him guilty in publicly denying the decision of the Nuremberg Trials and distributing false reports about the actions of the USSR during the Second World War.

&gt;The basis for the prosecution was a particular passage in a pro-Ukrainian-nationalist article that Luzgin reposted:

1289,"&gt; It's just that English isn't actually needed to live in this country, taught as a second language in school is barely enough for kids to have a basic grasp of it, most just learn from watching TV/shows/music. Yes, it's useful, but it really isn't comparable like I said.

It might be the idea, but from my experience my Transylvanian Hungarian friends who went through the Romanian education system ended up knowing English orderly better than Romanian. 
Also, I think starting at age 13 with 2-3 years of second language education (designed for non native speakers) one has competent knowledge to those who from age 6 native speaker-like education was forced onto.

Talking about time, you did not comment the fact, that for native Romanian speakers learning Hungarian (that takes much more effort) is taught as a second language designed for non-native speakers. Still being unable to communicate in Hungarian is an unknown issue for these people. See there is no demand from them for the Hungarian as second language education.

&gt;  don't live in Hungarian majority regions, and even the ones that do still need to know Romanian well if they wanna actually participate in the life of this country. 

Them saying the country should put effort into changing itself to respect their rights and benefit is just as a solid argument as for you to say they need to put effort in order to participate in the life of the country. And after all, it goes back to them saying countries are meant to serve their people, while you say people are meant to serve their countries.

&gt; The sad truth is that many choose to segregate themselves, and that is in part because they don't bother learning the language of the country very well.

Many have the option to live their lives despite the circumstances close to as if hundred years ago world politicians that had no local knowledge and interest in justice has not made a decision that would seal an unfair situation that has been taken advantage of ever since. I rather find it to be sad truth, they have to lobby for self evident rights.

&gt; probably fewer classes.

Merely your assumption. 

&gt;  I really don't see how you think that will make them more proficient.
 
Read me back or alternatively take into consideration how much you are able to learn from [this teacher in a Hungarian language class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI5QYiQWuFg), (granted kids here are able to understand &amp; communicate with the teacher which would not be the case for your classmates) compared to a Hungarian language class where the teacher can stop to translate you bits of information and require you at most to know half of the words she used.",,/r/europe/comments/8sg4r5/romania_exceeds_hungary_in_europes_ranking_of/e13er9o/,sgsgdark,1529647112

To put it bluntly, its the whole proverbial 'butterfly effect'. A flap of a butterflies wings can change the course of history. (Although that butterfly always existed, and hence you can not have a reality whereby it did not exist).

There are few people who had very dramatic effects on the course of history. A lot has to do with larger forces at play.. But one example, of someone who irrevocably changed history by his own persona, and the fact that he was born as a monarch in a recently united Greece, would indeed be Alexander the Great. A force the world was not ready for.. And indeed, he deviated from the 'common forces' so much, that, his empire disapeared soon after his death as a power struggle ensued. This is a start contrast to the Roman Empire, that stood for a much longer period, and never quite depended so much on one man, but rather well orchestrated multi-directional forces and established systems.

Yet, on a more fundamental level.. You reading this reply, and possibly replying to me... Means I may have fundamentally changed your life forever (Well not really - it was always going to happen) but the point, is, you will now get your coffee a bit later..

[Capitalism will eat up democracy unless we speak up](https://www.ted.com/talks/yanis_varoufakis_capitalism_will_eat_democracy_unless_we_speak_up)

- Great Ted talk, by your Australian educated economics professor. ;)

Since when do politicians serve the people? Our western democracies are based on the Magna Carta. And forces, beyond the working class. 

Consider yourself lucky, Australia is working so well. 

The answer to that question is not so simple. 

A better question is why did Tzipras current PM betray Yiannis Varoufakis  (The finance minister he begged to help him solve the EU crisis).... Who in fact, talks extensively.. About punishing Corrupt banks.

Yiannis Varoufakis explains this best, when he had a conversation with Obama... And realised how powerless obama was. Obama told him, I wanted to throw all those wall street bastards in prison after the financial crash. And he could not do a thing.

Again, democracies are based on the Magna Carta.. a British Document, meant to transfer away power from Kings, towards oligarchs and masters.

The honest answer? Why did they not vote someone in to do that? Because firstly, politicians have no real power.. Secondly Tsipras the greek PM went against what he was mandated to do..

And just so you understand.. Tsipras was a tiny minority party of 20 percent...  The traditional parties... All corrupt and in power for years.. Your two options.. Were all full of shit... So indeed, the Greeks did actually vote completely against the establishment.

The answer however is that these guys are controlled by capitalistic forces, and special interest groups.

Western media outlets, many of whom's companies have large Chinese investment, roar about terrors like Trump and Putin and Erdoghan etc. etc. day to day back to back, yet rarely if at all talk negatively (or at all) about dictator President for life Xi Jinping, a brutal racist autocrat who's government has intentionally enticed tens of millions of ethnic Han Chinese to migrate into ethnically separate regions of China like Xinjiang (Uyghurs), Inner Mongolia (Mongols) and Tibet (Tibetans) in order to overwhelm and destroy the local civilization and completely sinificate the regions, turned China into an Orwellian Nightmare with facial-recognition cameras at every step and a social credit system based on how closely you obey the government determining your rights in society. It is completely and utterly corrupt, ingrained into the country due to China's culture of Master and Student relationships and Gifts and Repayment Favours superceding that of Law and Order, and every country China touches gets infected.
In addition, it is rapidly turning islands it should have no authority over throughout South East Asia into island forts, missile silos and army bases. China is currently building a massive military highway through the Himalayan belt on the border with India, something India was furious about and stepped in to put a stop to (in on section of the Himalayas), and it's One-Belt-One-Road project is going to give it enormous leverage over international affairs. The gov. has enormous amounts of pro-Chinese  or Pro-Chinese-government trolls online, less known about because they are not in the limelight but by far the most numerous, who try to shut down any negative discussion on China or attempt to spin-doctor horrible things the Chinese state is doing or has done like Tianamen Square, Uyghur repression, Tibet, etc..

When asked specifically about tariffs on Canadian imports, the number of Americans who disagree rises to 62 percent. Fifty-eight percent of Republicans approve of the Canadian tariffs.""

[Politico/Morning Consult, June 1](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2018/china-trade-poll/): ""When it comes to trade, would you prefer the Trump administration focus more on negotiating trade agreements to open new markets to sell American-made goods (70%) or imposing tariffs or taxes on foreign products to slow down their sales in the U.S (14%).""

[CNN/SSRS (pdf warning), June 18](http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2018/images/06/20/rel6e.-.economy,.trade.pdf): ""Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling foreign trade? Approve: 39%; disapprove: 50%.""

&gt;Throw in that there have been dozens of things that in the past I'd have assumed would seriously damage a presidency, that don't seem to have done much more than scratch this one

I mean, in terms of his approval polling, he's the least popular president since the 70s.

On further analysis, he's actually the least popular president in the history of polling.  I realized that [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/) lets you compare Trump's net favorability to that of other presidents, and it's lower than all of them (look at the graphs midway down the page).

The problem is that the Republicans control both chambers of Congress and are almost never willing to challenge him.  That's why it appears that his trainwreck of an administration has barely been scratched by its malfeasance.  Things will be different after the midterms.  Democrats have already flipped 43 state legislative seats, a US Senate seat, 2 state governors, and a US House seat since Trump took office.  That's a really good record, and it shows that voters are energized to oppose the Republicans in many parts of the country.

That said, you’re also falling into the same logical hole that you’re blaming the people who built the Modern Turkey 90 years ago — Turkey isn’t western, or non-western, it’s a multitude of things. As you yourself tell, there is no one single Turkey (since you say that Turkey could not be a nation state), but then you make petty ad-hominem arguments about how I am yearning to be European and Western (which I am not, far from it — I think Turkey is best served by being its own thing), implying that your view of Turkey is the only one that matters. I was born and educated in Turkey, I spent majority of my life there, my opinion is just as valid as yours. You want it to be not a western country, fine, you can work towards that, it is a democracy after all. I think it is still, though, so at best, we’ll have to agree to disagree. 

Honestly, I used to think Turkey wasn’t western when I lived in it. Only when I actually travelled to the non-western world that I realised Turkey is obviously so. You might think you’re so different than a Dane, or a Pole, or an Italian, but compared to a Japanese, a Maori or a Hmong, it is so painstakingly obvious that we are, in the grand scheme of things, bickering over fairly small differences.

I don't want it to be a not western country, it simply isn't. It has western elements that's true and it had since as long as Turks moved into here. Including in part deep-rooted western elements which flowed naturally, and imposed ones from last century that stand out sour. However those elements are a part, not the whole, they were diffused, imported and traded. In the actual West however, what's ""Western"" was defined also on what is not Turkish. Occident formed itself against the orient, drawing and building its identity from its first states, very proactively and in exclusion.

1465,"&gt;but we could use a trade dispute with Europe to open up more markets.

I don't particularly like it, but TTIP would have opened up more access to EU markets for US firms... I'm not sure that this approach, trying to use tariffs as a stick will work. The EU is in a bit of a d￼defensive stand as it is, it's also quite happy to push protectionist measures.  With the UK leaving, one of the more moderating voices in terms of open markets is on its way out too.  I wouldn't be surprised if the EU blinks first, but it'll take concessions on both sides to open anything up, and the EU being a block means it's going to be somewhat awkward to get anywhere on any single trade issue, simply because there is not only EU politics involved, but also lots of national politics.  Throw in a rather significant dislike of Trump (and political capital to be made by being seen to oppose him) and the ability for very pro-EU types to use this current scenario to paint it as a US vs EU thing and I can't see a clear way to get to what you are suggesting.

1474,"The way in which German participle constructions are used in elaborated speech (in the style of *participlium coniuncum* and *ablativus absolutus*) was copied from Latin (I believe in the 18th century, but I am not sure). English copied them from Latin, too, and went much further, probably due to the strong influence of French that had gone back for centuries.

Also the German tense system was categorized according to the Latin system, which led to the Futur I and II tenses, for example. These do not really fit into the system of Germanic grammar (a similar problem occurs with ""will future"" in English). Until today it is difficult to say whether these two languages actually have a future tense because the Latin and Germanic systems are not really compatible with each other.

Needs a central Financial stimulus, akin the USA to succeed. The money loaned to Greece in unsustainable. Has severely crippled Greece. Entire system may collapse, if Germany keeps repeating this process. German Tax payers should not be bailing out countries. Integrity of financial instutions should be centralised.

&gt; Why Germany Cannot and Should Not Pay to Save the Eurozone
Munich Seminar on 11 June 2018 with Prof. Yanis Varoufakis in the Grosse Aula of the Ludwig-Maximilian University.


&gt; “Why Germany Cannot and Should Not Pay to Save the Eurozone” is the topic of a speech to be given by Prof. Yanis Varoufakis.

&gt; The euro crisis has highlighted the urgent need for reform in the Eurozone. However, approaches to a solution can be divided into two camps. The dissent, primarily between France and Germany, is reflected very clearly in their different attitudes towards fiscal union. While the French strongly support a fiscal union, which necessarily implies fiscal transfers by Germany and other donor countries, Germany absolutely rejects a fiscal union and favours a post-crisis write-off of bad loans instead.

&gt; In his speech Professor Varoufakis will argue that both visions are flawed and potentially even dangerous. Moreover, the proposal to draft a new constitution for the Eurozone would not represent any real progress in the current political climate. Instead Professor Varoufakis clearly differentiates between the solution to the Eurozone’s structural problems and the zeal and ambitions of the political class.

I'm Kurdish and I disagree. It's just any other day.

That's telling isn't it? At one point he was progressing (with words) the conflict. However I think Erdogan wanted to con the Kurds, what he did not see coming is the Syrian conflict forcing him to act on his true intentions and jumping the gun, thus losing the Kurdish votes, once that occurred he had no issue creating a war zone over there.

&gt;In an act of retaliation for the killings on Bloody Sunday, a number of Polish civilians were executed by German military units of the Einsatzgruppen, Waffen SS, and Wehrmacht. 

Bloody Sunday:

&gt;Bloody Sunday was a series of killings of members of the German minority that took place at the beginning of World War II. On September 3, 1939, two days after the beginning of the German invasion of Poland, highly controversial killings occurred in and around Bydgoszcz (German: Bromberg), a Polish city with a sizable German minority.

1688,"Yep, official party documents. It's from their ""Principle program"" which they adopted in 2011 which can be found under ""opinion documents"" on their website right under their election platform for 2018. So it's not something they've since disowned. https://sd.se/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/principprogrammet2014_webb.pdf (In Swedish, sorry. But it's on chapter 2 page 8 if you want to use google translate to confirm it)

Essentially they say that they take ""a more nuanced and therefore more realistic view of humans."" Then comes the part where they say they don't believe that humans are ""born blank slates that can be filled with any content whatsoever"". They explain that they do think that nurture plays a big role in how a person is but ""there is also an inherited essence that cannot be supressed too much without there being consequences"" and that ""some of this essence is common for most humans, **some are unique to certain groups of people** and some to the individual. They then go on like that, explaining how this means structures and traditions and nations and such are important. Then they add a little sexism for good measure talking about the biological differences between men and women.

In all honesty, I'm both surprised that they leave that up there considering them trying to distance themselves from their skinhead-ish past and that it's not something brought up more by other parties. They often talk about how SD does not share their ""value base"" but they often fail to go into detail.

1709,"The average Turkish Kurd is way more conservative than the average citizen who identifies as a Turk.

Honor killings, arranged marriages, child marriages, etc are most prevalent in Southeastern Anatolia. In addition, the region has the highest rate of consanguinity (cousin marriages) in Turkey (42% in 2016). 

It has historically been this way. When the Turkish Republic was founded, [the first sharia protests were perpetrated by the Kurdish minorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Said_rebellion). This particular rebellion is still being taught in schools, but despite being a part Islamist and a part Kurdish-nationalist rebellion, it's taught as an Islamist rebellion alone.   
During last year's referendum, there was a minor scandal as Erdoğan's party had put up [banners](https://i.cnnturk.com/ps/cnnturk/75/650x325/58d52635f0dc1e31f8e9d821.jpg) in the Kurdish-majority Diyarbakır province that read ""Every 'Yes' vote is a prayer to Sheikh Said"", Sheikh Said being the head of the Islamist rebellion. 

As for HDP, despite being a leftist party, their voters [are more conservative than Erdoğan's base](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/62za5e/survey_should_turkey_stay_as_a_secular_state/). Mind you, they have the 4th most Islamist voterbase in this survey, and the 5th party is a literal Islamist party (they're the guys in the new coalition).  
As for why HDP is a leftist party; some say it's because they want the votes of leftist Turks in the west (for example; those in İzmir, the city in the pic). But frankly separatism has always somewhat leftist. 

There's also many anecdotal pieces of evidence lying around. I won't bother with making a huge list (they're *anecdotal* after all), but you can read the ['Turkey' section of Wikipedia's ""Honor killings"" page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_killing#Turkey), where it goes into details on how the majority of Islamic killings in Turkey are either commited by Southeasterns, or those who migrated to big cities (İzmir, İstanbul) from the southeast.

***

As for your ""Stockholm Syndrome"" reply on anther comment: As I said, Turkish Kurds traditionally have been this way, long before Erdoğan. This is due to many reasons; The secularists haven't been nice to them, they're geographically more closer to Arabia so their culture is more conservative, the Ottoman Empire gave them *some* level of autonomy, so on. Their Islamism has little to do with the Islamist politicians of Turkey. I'd go as far as saying it's the opposite; people like Erdoğan pander towards the Kurds.

Same is in romania. The government has a fund for “religious cults”, however the main and official religion is orthodox, so most of the money goes to them. This is not pocket change.

People in villages are very religious and will follow the priest, out of respect or fear (of god). They will give money when told to and will vote for whoever the priest says does right by god.

Everything also has a price. Weddings, funerals, baptisms, events for which rarely you will get a receipt and which can vary from priest to priest. The orthodox curch does not pay taxes.

İnce does not use the same language. He does not accuse the AKP and MHP voters of being terrorists, for instance, while Melih Gökçek tweets the opposition being terrorists wholesale.

Meanwhile, Erdoğan berates an entire 50% of people. There are similarities, and yet, he is not the CHP's Erdoğan.

If he becomes such, the proper democrats of this country will stand up against his wrongs, as well. Right now, getting rid of Erdoğan and his sycophants is the first priority.

[https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nederland/dieren-levend-gekookt-en-gevild-in-nederlandse-slachthuizen](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nederland/dieren-levend-gekookt-en-gevild-in-nederlandse-slachthuizen)

Pigs that drown in a glowing hot water bath, screaming and kicking violently. And calves and sheep that are skinned alive. This type of animal suffering is encountered by inspectors in Dutch slaughterhouses. This is apparent from reports requested by the editors of RTL News from the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA).

In more than 2 years, the NVWA has imposed 48 fines at 19 slaughterhouses for abuses in the supply and killing of animals. In total there are 180 slaughterhouses where pigs, cattle and sheep are slaughtered. One slaughterhouse was fined as much as 11. Company names are not released. 

The reason for requesting the Dutch data was the shocking undercover images that came out last year from a Belgian slaughterhouse in Tielt. The Dutch government and the meat sector said at the time that serious abuses of this kind did not occur in our slaughterhouses.

There are shortcomings, however, as well-known then State Secretary Van Dam on Radio 1, 'but', added: 'we have no indication that something like what happened in Belgium would also happen in the Netherlands'.

The inspection reports of the NVWA now show that this is not the case. Things regularly go wrong when animals are killed. After anaesthesia, the carotid arteries must be severed. In 16 cases, the inspectors found that this was a mistake. The animals then still live while the slaughter process continues.

Splashing in hot bath

As a result, several pigs ended up living in a hot bowl of water of 60 degrees. An inspector writes: ""A pig started to flounder and move with the whole body. The splashing became much more intense, with large amounts of water coming over the edge. The pig was then pushed under water by an iron construction in which it drowned.

The inspector writes that the pig was conscious when it entered the hot bath and that the pig suffered severely as a result. 

This happened at another abattoir just in front of an NVWA inspector. He sees four pigs going into the 60 degree hot water tank one after the other. They try to stay above water and pedal with their legs.

Last year Animal Rights published the images of the Belgian abattoir in Tielt. The animal rights organisation is scared of what they read in the NVWA reports. ""Those pigs are actually cooked alive,"" says director Robert Molenaar. ""When the Belgian images came out, I was often asked: is this also the case in the Netherlands? I guessed so then, but here it is now in black and white.

A horror setting

The pieces contain dozens of other offences, such as crippled animals that suffer during walking and animals that are skinned alive. Cutting is done in a calf that is still moving. The inspector writes: ""Despite the movements of the calf, he (the slaughterer) removed the calf from its head skin and wanted to continue cutting the front claws"", but the inspector knows how to prevent this.

They have never heard of this kind of abuse with Animal Rights: ""This is a horror setting, the inspector is there,"" says Robert Molenaar. In another slaughterhouse, inspectors see two sheep being skinned alive.

ZIE OOK: Examples of animal suffering in slaughterhouses (note: shocking)

In its response, the NVWA states that the infringements for which it has fined slaughterhouses in recent years were not sufficient to close a slaughterhouse. ""We intervene with a means that is proportionate to the seriousness and frequency of the violation.

Usually, a warning is given first, followed by fines, which can also be increased. If this does not help - and then, according to an NVWA spokesman, you have to 'make it very colourful' - then a company can only be closed down.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8stq54/animals_cooked_and_skinned_live_in_dutch/e1254et/,MarcusLuty,1529601678

1885,"*Cheering populists elsewhere should be careful what they wish for*

by Philip Stephens

Angela Merkel is besieged. The Bavarian sister party of the German chancellor’s Christian Democratic Union wants tougher frontier controls. The anti-migrant pose struck by Horst Seehofer, the Christian Social Union interior minister in Ms Merkel’s coalition, is cheered by populists from Warsaw to Rome, via Vienna and Budapest. Have any of them thought, some of us wonder, what a Germany taking a nationalist turn might actually look like?

Mr Seehofer’s motives are transparent. The CSU suffered a mauling at the hands of the unashamedly xenophobic Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the 2017 national election. Facing a state poll in October, the party now wants to outflank AfD. EU leaders will discuss a European-wide migration scheme later this month. If he is not happy, Mr Seehofer is threatening unilateral controls.

Many Germans — a majority, the latest poll suggests — remain suspicious of the chancellor’s open borders strategy. Among neighbours, the Visegrad Four — Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary — are fierce critics. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party and Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, scorn efforts to disperse asylum seekers across the union.

Italy’s new government — a populist coalition of the Five Star Movement and the anti-migrant League — is shutting ports to refugees crossing from north Africa. Matteo Salvini, the interior minister and leader of the League, made it an early act to turn away the rescue ship Aquarius. Austrian conservative leader Sebastian Kurz proposes an “axis” with fellow hardliners in Rome and Berlin to seal the frontiers.

The populists are united in their simple sloganising. Hungary’s population is shrinking and ageing, as talented young people seek opportunities elsewhere. Yet Budapest is proud of its barbed-wire camps for asylum seekers and migrants unfortunate enough to cross the border.

The reality, of course, is that no single government can take control of its frontiers. The narrow national interests held dear by populists frequently collide with each other. It is forgotten now, but Ms Merkel kept open Germany’s borders in 2015 to ease pressure on Austria. Vienna risked being overwhelmed by refugees bussed from, well, Mr Orban’s Hungary.

The nationalists’ pitch is to fear and emotion rather than reason. If they thought about it, they would know that beggar-thy-neighbour policies cannot work. Closing a border has a ricochet effect. Mr Kurz must surely realise that Mr Seehofer’s plans would leave Austria to cope with refugees stranded on the wrong side of the German border.

Does Mr Salvini understand, one wonders, that Mr Seehofer wants those arriving at the German frontier to be returned to the place they were first registered? Much of the time, that would be Italy. The Mediterranean front-line states complain their northern partners do not share the migrant burden. Polish and Hungarian nationalists would be the very last to make such an offer.

Untying this Gordian knot with a migration system that is humane, fair and sustainable requires a collective effort to harden the EU’s external borders and equitably accommodate those granted asylum. It demands also more effort — and aid — to help sub-Saharan Africa. This is what Ms Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, have been discussing. Mr Seehofer has no real alternative.

He is far from alone, however, in selling his party as one that puts Germany First. Nor is a rising nationalist mood confined to hostility towards migration. Markus Söder, the CSU prime minister of Bavaria, thinks the country has broader lessons to learn from Donald Trump’s belligerent unilateralism.

It is not at all hard to imagine where a new German nationalism could lead. The AfD made its name opposing financial support for weaker members of the eurozone — the so-called transfer union that leaves Germans at the mercy of supposedly profligate southern Europeans. As principal EU paymaster, why not extend the principle beyond the single currency to other projects?

Mr Kaczynski is forever hurling insults in the direction of Berlin. Yet Poland is the biggest recipient of EU aid. Why should German taxpayers write large cheques to Warsaw? Likewise for Hungary, where the government is substituting crony capitalism for the market economy — in significant part at Germany’s expense. Berlin could better deploy its economic clout to projects that confer direct national advantage.

Those with dark memories of war have less to fear. There is nothing militaristic about Germany First politics. The impulse, rather, is isolationist. Most Germans would probably spend less on defence. And why not? The nation is too powerful to be threatened by its neighbours. Berlin can always reach an accommodation with Moscow: Russian energy for German technology makes for a natural fit. Let Poland and others on the EU’s eastern frontier pay for Nato if they feel threatened by Russia.

Germany is some way off reaching such judgments. Ms Merkel is still convinced — and rightly so — that the nation’s long-term interests reside in liberal internationalism. The chancellor will not easily surrender her convictions. But she has been weakened. After 12 years, her time is running out. And Mr Seehofer and his allies are setting a different direction of travel.

1919,"&gt; Maybe i'm a bit too fed up on propaganda. What did she do to earn distrust exactly?

She didn't do anything specific. I agree with you fully that there isn't anything significant that we could possible complain about Merkel when it comes to her position towards Russia.

This isn't really about her though. She is just one politician constrained by her voter's preferences, by her own party, by her sister party, by her coalition partners, by the German economic and energy lobby and all sorts of other factors.

You said it yourself - currenly Germans are very pacifistic people. They would not want their military to be deployed to help their allies. Many Germans would probably prefer to not send their military abroad at all in any circumstances. It's of course nice that you would diplomatically want to prevent the conflict or solve the conflict if it already happened. We would want that too of course. It's not as if everyone in CEE would absolutely love to be in war with Russia.

But what if the war cannot be diplomatically avoided? What then, are you going to watch the Baltics being swallowed? Poland attacked? How far would you let the Russians to go, to the Czech-German border?

We are talking about the historic memory of Germany and how it influences your current position, but I think you are forgetting about ours. Our historic memory from the 20th century is that of an abandonment. This is something that most of CEE countries suffer from, this is where the distrust comes from originally. We were left behing before by our allies. When Hitler was carving up Czechoslovakia, nobody came to help us. When Poland was attacked, nobody came to help them. When they were handed over to USSR, nobody stood up for them. When the Soviets crushed Hungarian Uprising in the 50s, they were left alone and when they came in the 60s to Czechoslovakia, we were on our own too.

I understand that these were different times, but this doesn't mean that it didn't case significant wounds on the national psyché that still have their effect until today.

So in other words, the idea isn't that Germany will not at all try to stand on our side, that you will willingly conspire against us with Russia. The idea is that you will cave in under pressure, that you will say that the Baltics (Romania, Poland, Slovakia, us or whatever other CEE country) is just not worth risking a war over.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/8s7gf6/russias_nord_stream_ii_pipeline_is_ukraines_worst/e11vyz6/,kristynaZ,1529594054

1978,"&gt; **The Audiencia of Navarra decrees the provisional freedom for ""La Manada"".**
&gt; 
&gt; - The court that sentenced the five men to nine years for a crime of continuous sexual abuse adopts this measure with the vote against one of the three magistrates.
&gt; 
&gt; The Second Section of the Audiencia of Navarra has ordered the provisional release of the 5 men sentenced to nine years in prison for a crime of sexual abuse against a young woman from Madrid, during the Sanfermines of 2016, with a singular vote against the sentence of one of three magistrates, as has been known The Confidential Legal Sources. The court has adopted this decision when it is about to expire the maximum period of two years stipulated for the provisional detention, although once this period is over, the law contemplates the review of the case, its possible extension until half of the sentence is served.
&gt; 
&gt; In this way, José Ángel Prenda, Ángel Boza and Jesús Escudero, who remain in the Pamplona prison, and Antonio Manuel Guerrero and Alfonso Jesús Cabezuelo, who are in the Alcalá Meco prison, can regain their freedom in the next few hours, since his provisional release is effective almost immediately. The decision was adopted by the same court that condemned them with 2 votes in favor and 1 against. It should be recalled that the five members of La Manada were condemned with the votes of the president of the court, Francisco José Cobo, and Raquel Fernandino, and the rejection of Judge Ricardo González, who cast a political vote in favor of his acquittal.
&gt; 
&gt; The hearing to decide whether to adopt the decision of provisional release or did not take place on Monday in view of the July 7 deadline of two years was established by the law for provisional detention. In addition, the defenses of the five defendants have demanded provisional release pending the case to reach the Superior Court of Justice of Navarre (TSJN), which must be placed on the resources that have been presented by all parties. Forecasts suggest that this court will address the appeals in September or October, although, whatever the resolution, the case will almost certainly reach the Supreme Court, as the parties have confirmed that they will exhaust the judicial channels.
&gt; 
&gt; The members of La Manada regained their freedom after the same court that was now decreeing his release reject up to three times his provisional release alleging risk of escape and criminal reiteration with the private vote against González. The first occasion was in July of 2017 when the Second Section rejected this measure with a discrepant private vote that called for its release with a guarantee of 6,000 euros and other complementary measures. The second time it took place in September 2017 was when the Audiencia de Navarra dismissed the technology resources due to the proximity of the trial. Finally, in November of last year, the court dismissed the request for the defense of his release.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, the court considers that these circumstances of risk of flight and criminal reiteration do not occur and decides to release him. The five members of La Manada were sentenced to nine years in prison, a penalty well below those requested by the Prosecutor's Office and the different accusations, which were between 22 and 25 years in prison. The court dismissed the crime of sexual assault by not having received a public complaint for the crime of social outrage and that has been appealed by the Public Prosecutor, the private prosecution and popular actions, exercised by the Government of Navarre and the City Council of Pamplona. The ruling was also repeated by the defense, which ensured that it consisted of consensual sexual relations.",Catalan Republic,/r/europe/comments/8sspxm/wolf_pack_gang_sentenced_to_9_years_for_continous/e11wglt/,Erratic85,1529594472

My question:

Your answer:
&gt;they have a culture which is criminal.

My question:
&gt;So according to you all Roma are illegal?

Your answer:
&gt;most of them are

My point is, if you guys want to mak ethis about law, keep it about law. You want criminals behaving according to law? Congratulations, we all do. Now, making this about ""gypsies"" is dumb, aying ""I want gypsies out"" and arguing, I want them out because I want criminals deported is saying ""all gypsies are criminals"".

You really need numbers to pull various of those statements off, first off are most gypsies in Italy really from other EU countries? Well, you need a source for that. Are most people who are of either Rom, Sinti or Calé origin engaged in criminal activities? You need a source for that too. And last but not least, would you deport any person from any nationality in Italy that was squatting? Because if you consider that only gypsies comitting said crime deserve deportation, then there might be a problem with your logic.

It's about the flow between 2010 to 2015 , things changed radically since mid 2017 when then italian Interior minister Minniti made a deal with the Libyan government and tribes to tackle illegal immigration.

Check the third table on this pdf by the Italian Interior ministry:

http://www.interno.gov.it/sites/default/files/cruscotto_statistico_giornaliero_21-06-2018.pdf

What I linked is up to date data costantly updated month by month.

I agree that ""So if every EU nation would decide on it's own immigration plan, it would cost Italy the most."" but isn't that what is already happening? Other E.U countries does not seem to give a fuck about helping Italy and the E.U has done nothing really significant about it, so much for solidarity (despite Italy being a net contributor to the E.U budget it seems that on important issues like migration no one wants to really help and people keep wondering why Salvini and Lega keep soaring in the polls) and I say this as someone who is usually more pro E.U than your average Italian these days.

&gt;Germany refuses to take much more immigrants from other EU nations in and plans to send some of them back to Italy.

And Salvini is simply going to shut the border and refuse to take any of them and refuse to sign any deal allowing that. And who can blame him in this case, I didn't vote Lega or M5S but in this case they are right.

I don't see how letting Germany walk all over us and start deporting migrants back to italy in exchange for nothing and with nearly no help at all from the E.U like in the past years is going to make things any better for italy.

Also Italians have not been voting to let all the immigrants in trains to germany and sweden like you say, of the illegal immigrants that have landed in italy the mayority are still here in italy.

&gt; In 1636, the indigenous Caribs rose against the settlers to drive them off the island in the first of many skirmishes. The French successfully repelled the natives and forced them to retreat to the eastern part of the island, on the Caravelle Peninsula in the region then known as the Capesterre. When the Carib revolted against French rule in 1658, the Governor Charles Houël du Petit Pré retaliated with war against them. Many were killed; those who survived were taken captive and expelled from the island. Some Carib had fled to Dominica or St. Vincent, where the French agreed to leave them at peace.

However, let's see it this way: Even in an hypothetical scenario in which Kurds get to demand referendum in Turkish cities in towards the Central Anatolia, it won't change jack shit. Everyone knows this. Ankara will not sit on its ass and wait Kurds to tear the land apart. It's a far-fetched, stupid idea.

And for the referandum, actually it can be a fair one with foreign parties and international bodies being a part of the process, but again, I don't see Kurdish nationalists being happy with being limited to places they can win, and sure they won't be happy with having a referendum for the traditonal Kurdistan either. Actually, even if there aren't much now, there is the tendency of some Turks and non-Kurds to even want to separate the Kurdish zones all together.

2213,"&gt; I was talking about case law as a principle. That is that when a new law that contains non-defined terminology such as 'fair', 'reasonable' etc comes out, cases will have to be handled and decided by courts eventually before we know where the line goes between what is reasonable and what is not.

Debating the semantics of ""duly justify"" in order to prove that no justifications are required is a waste of time.

The same goes for debating the semantics of ""within a reasonable period of time"" in order to prove that any time frame is reasonable.

The fact remains that Youtube does not ""duly justify"" it's copyright infringement take-downs and it doesn't solve cases that challenge them ""within a reasonable period of time"". Debating semantics will not change this. You're just trying to stall this discussion.

&gt; Again, for the Nth time semantics is important here because semantics is what the whole law rests upon

Again, this is about EU law. This is about an EU directive which is meant to be implemented into actual law by EU members. Those local laws are the ones meant to be specific to the level that you're asking for because, otherwise, people would be screaming that the EU is stealing their autonomy and their sovereignty.

&gt; your head is in the right place, you're just slightly mis-informed about how the actual legal process works

The purpose of this discussion was to dispel the ""link tax"" and ""memes will be banned"" rhetorics that have been common in recent days.

If we're to debate the semantics of the law, as you demand, these ideas are easily proven false by the sheer fact that they are not present in the text of the law. Those who spread them are making huge leaps of the imagination. That's the point I'm trying to make.

Hitler's other published works include the long-running fanzine *Storm* and the novels *The Master Race*, *The Thousand Year Rule*, and *The Triumph of the Will*.

In addition to what /u/MarktpLatz wrote, without Hitler's leadership, the Nazi Party fell apart in 1923 and the Communist Party of Germany succeeded in fomenting a German communist revolution in 1930.

Yeah... Not really. The problem with using Google Trends is that it can be a tad misleading.

I think your point here certainly shows that propaganda works, I mean, you are reiterating a false narriative from almost 2 years ago, one that is still very popular amongst remain supporters in the UK. In fact it's something I've seen repeated again a few times since the withdrawal bill passed yesterday, again as a result of people genuinely thinking that the legislation wouldn't pass, or that parliament would simply not legislate, or that it'd turn out at the last moment that the Labour party in the UK were pro-EU etc..

Were some people caught up n the propaganda of the campaign? Almost certainly, on both the remain and leave side of the argument. Was it the biggest contributing factor?

2360,"&gt;The best solution to a declining population is higher birth rates, not more immigrants.

But it's not realistic.

Even more so, the population in most CEE countries will decline anyway, even if you'd bump up your fertility rates *and* started letting people in. As can be seen in the [hard data](https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1872-width/20170715_WOC269_0.png).

&gt;I have an unscientific hunch 

A hunch... I prefer hard data. Data says the population will decline in CEE countries. But mentioning this hard data, will get one downvoted on this sub, cause people don't want to hear it.

Fine, act like kids and ignore the problem. It's not my problem anyway. Downvoting me will not change the data.

&gt;Here is an example of the Dutch Bible Belt.

Bible belters always get loads of kids. That has always been the case. But if you take a closer look at our ""bible belt"", you will find that it isn't *that* religious. In most places, it's about 10% or less of the electorate. We don't have *that* many zealots over here, so they might get more kids indeed, but in total it's not really a lot, since they're only a small part of our society.

We, The Netherlands, need migrants, too, or our population will decline as well, as can be seen in the map above.

Luckily, most people over here accept this, cause over here we know that not all migrants are terrorists, as they tend to believe in some other countries.

And if you look at both your maps, there isn't a one-on-one correlation. They get kids outside the belt, too. Look at [Friesland](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Friesland_in_the_Netherlands.svg/264px-Friesland_in_the_Netherlands.svg.png), for instance. Hardly bible belt, yet still pretty dark blue.

&gt;It would seem logical that given enough time and incentives our demographic situation would stabilize.

Hard data, from multiple sources, states otherwise and that the population *will* decline in most CEE countries. A lot even in some countries. We're talking millions here.

Using your example from the bible belt, a country like Poland should have no problems at all even right now, since it's the most religious country in Europe. Yet they have a problem. So your logic doesn't apply. Their population will fall the [hardest](https://www.statista.com/statistics/253383/total-population-of-the-eu-member-states-by-country/). And it's not likely to change, despite the government even throwing loads of money at people to persuade them to get more kids these days. There's been a small rise in the the last 2 years (from 1.29 to 1.42), but it's still [well below](https://www.mercatornet.com/demography/view/the-polish-fertility-rise/21126) the replacement rate of 2.1. And that is *with* an active government throwing money at people to get kids.

Same goes for your own country. You've gone from a 2.33 rate in 2060 to 1.4 in 2017. It might go [up and down](https://www.statista.com/statistics/348296/fertility-rate-in-croatia/) *a bit*, but in the long run it's going down, down, [down](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SPDYNTFRTINHRV).

2394,"&gt; Employment rate for asylum seekers is 11% for Netherlands sourced by our own government.  

At least in Germany, asylum seekers are not allowed to work, unless their asylum has been approved.  
But I don't know how that works in the Netherlands, so this statistic has to be taken with a grain of salt  
&gt; Depending on the type of immigration, there is a huge statistical difference in the income between western and non western immigrants (source).  

That's normal, since non-native speakers earn less and work jobs that have smaller salaries.  
In the US, that's how companies keep costs down.  
(whether that's good or not) 
&gt; Non western immigration cost more in healthcare then native people (source).  

Understandable, since their standards are _usually_ not up to par.  
Also when people are coming from a warzone, the usually don't leave there because everything was fine.  
 
&gt; The demographic difference between income groups is also pretty high. Upper regions all filled by native and western immigrants, and the opposite for the lowest income brackets.

This is pretty much the same argument as your second.  
&gt; The meaning of welfare slowly is turning into 'subsidies for non western people (Source 1, source2).  

Working people pay for non working people, that's how welfare and social security works.  
If western countries have full employment, good.  
I don't get how that's a problem.  
Migrants come into a country and will eventually join the job market.  
&gt; 7 out of 10 Somalians are in welfare (source).  

Then educate them to be valuable for the job market and don't just put them in containment centers (or whatever they are called right now) 
&gt; And somehow the re-circulation of money makes it a positive thing for us. I propose upping the welfare for everyone and give us the biggest economical boost ever.

I'm up for a basic income, so yeah.  
The background might also be, that when you take in migrants and educate them, once they go back to their country they will work to up the standard of living in their native country, which will up trade with those countries.  
Sure, might be a bit far-fetched, but politics should always aim for the long term effects and not short term reliefs.

But you are very correct in that
&gt;So as long as low-support parties are around that don't even want anything to be changed and only play the role of the opposition while they get paid all the same, Fidesz has almost all the de facto power.

&gt; But now, the way politics has gone, I am becoming more cynical. We went from everyone saying that this was an important issue -- the Swedish Prime Minister saying we all had to open our hearts -- to now, where you can't even say in politics that you are pro-migration because that means political suicide. Now it's a competition of who can present the harshest immigration policies.

&gt; It's sad. Nothing good will come out of this. It's turning into a competition. Everyone was afraid of the right-wing populists. Now, their policies are the ones that Social Democrats and other parties are in favor of.

That wikipedia section link refers to the book Kolb, Eberhard (2005). The Weimar Republic. New York: Routledge. p. 140.     
     
Calling it the Weimar Revolution in itself is weird, because [the uprising in 1918](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Revolution_of_1918%E2%80%9319) was a complex period of turmoil where not nearly all people who revolted were aiming for a soviet revolution. The Weimar Republic that came after it brought democracy. A democracy with some faults, a shaky democracy, but a democracy nonetheless and (luckily) not a communist state.      
     
Even ignoring the confusing bundling together of the turmoil of 1918 and the Weimar republic that came after it, just throwing it out there ""that the jews were the majority culprits"" behind the turmoil is a nazi talking point. Sure, some Jewish people were also involved. But ""the majority behind it"" is the kind of vague conspiracy statement that is impossible to disprove because you can use shifting definitions of what ""the leaders"" means.         
      
The person who claimed the jewish conspiracy wins, because if we start discussing what ""a majority"" means, and at what percentage point someone is a Jew (only if the mother is a jew... when the grandmother was a jew, etc) we're only talking about jews, which was actually the aim of the conspiracy peddler in the first place.",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/8s9x44/what_do_you_know_about_adolf_hitler/e119ogr/,olddoc,1529560872

Theres nothing wrong with being pro islam and many if not most muslims are affable normal people, but the BBCs reporting itself is biased in favour of muslims and against people who try to criticise islamists or other muslim extremist groups. Being pro-islam as an opinion =/= being pro-islam as a news source that is supposed to uphold neutral and quality journalism.

Example being [a man on BBC Question Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PNkar7Yjtk) exposing that Didsbury Mosque, the mosque that the Manchester Bomber attended, shared anti-Western salafist propaganda on an open day, being shouted down and cut off by the BBC panel and a fellow Didsbury mosque attendee in the audience. The Didsbury Mosque is a known Salafist muslim mosque, salafism being the insane islamist hardline ideology of ISIS, Al-Quaeda and Saudi Arabia, contrary to the (lying) woman in the audience who said that the anti-Western propaganda had nothing to do with the Mosque.

The partisan questioning in this interview, especially when the interviewee does not speak english fluently, is more evidence of this bias.

2622,"&gt;Fair point, and at least that's consistent. I tend to argue that there are a slew of activities that need regulation, and important services that need to be provided (like courts, defence, policing etc..). 

The state is a necessary evil, sure. Regulation likewise. However a state unchecked and regulation run rampant are dangerous things. Who regulated the state? the demos, through their speech. It is for this reason I hold freedom of speech sacrosanct, we *must* have an filtered voice with which to critique the state. Speech can have whatever societal consequences the society deems fit, but no legal consequences in any circumstances. 
    
&gt;Because it contributes to violent acts, it creates a situation where violence is more likely. It should come with a test (That violence was likely..) but it's not unreasonable to have a penalty for advocating violence against another person.

My calling for violence doesn't cause any harm in and of itself. It takes another rational actor to exercise their autonomy to perform said violence.Perhaps my speech was an inciting incident, but how far up the chain of causation are you willing to prosecute?

&gt;Quite possibly yes, if you claimed someone had assaulted/kidnapped my kids I might well resort to violence quite quickly. In a crowd that might take on a larger aspect too.

You wouldn't though. As a rational actor you would perform independent inquiry and analysis. You would attempt to ascertain the current whereabouts of your children, ascertaining if they are missing. You would question the source of the information, how does this guy on the internet know my kids where taken by the Jewish Illuminati? Sure, you could be misled to violence, but hate speech laws don't stop that anyway. Incited, not so much.

&gt;They usually are, but at the same time, being told something that is untrue, that was likely to lead to you acting violently might be something you'd see as mitigating, or in the very least mean that someone else was also culpable to some extent. Someone telling you that X was coming to attack you might make it more likely for you to use violence in what you felt was self defence after all.

Know we get into collective guilt, the notion that multiple people could be responsible for the actions of a single person. That's not an idea I'm comfortable with.

&gt;But you can contribute to them. You aren't innocent when you use violence when it isn't justifiable, but someone who pushes you to use violence isn't totally innocent either. To take the Nazi point, do you not think that Nazi propaganda and education contributed to people being able to act in horrific ways? That was all largely just speech after all.

The state being beyond criticism lead to the Nazis using state infrastructure to commit genocide. If people had a platform to debunk such ideas, the state would never have gotten away with it. I don't think its fair to compare the entire infrastructure of a fascist state to a few edgelords on 4chan and just reduce it to ""incitement is dangerous"". 

&gt;And what about everything else? Fraud, Libel, Slander, Mis-selling... Even things like copyright and trademark laws are limits on free speech.

I honestly don't know where these fit in. Part of me says that they are all forms of misdirection, and that there are actions related to misdirection that could be criminalized instead of the speech itself. Another part says let this be the cost of having a voice with which to hold our state to account. I'm not suggesting absolute free speech would be a perfect solution, in certain situations people would fall through the cracks, as happens now with the Dankula case here in the UK. But I do think absolute free speech would be the lesser evil.",,/r/europe/comments/8sgus3/copyright_update_article_11_and_13_just_passed/e10vv9x/,frowaweylad,1529544003

2698,"&gt; they can point to the Germans and say that for Germany it has been accepted that way, so there's precedence

Except it hasn't actually been accepted

There has never been a situation where there was a permanent disagreement of EU law and the German Constitution. The German Constitutional Court has declared EU measures to be unconstitutional on several occasions. But every single time that situation was relatively quickly resolved by one of the following:

1. The EU measure was rescinded politically on the EU level

2. The German Constitution was amended to make the measure constitutional

3. The ECJ declared the measure illegal under EU law (usually either based on the Treaty on the EU or the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU)

Option 1. occured mainly when option 3. was overwhelmingly likely to occur

Option 2. generally only relates to procedural matters on how Germany represents itself within the EU institutions.

Option 3. is the real magic bullet here. Germany has made sure that without exception, all important provisions of the German constitution are covered by EU law, either by copying the provision into fundamental EU law or by explicitly making the issue a matter of the member state with no EU jurisdiction.

The German government is constitutionally obliged to make sure that EU law ensures ""essentially comparable"" protection of the rights and principles enshrined in the German constitution. The German Constitutional Court has ruled that it has fundamentally achieved that goal and that apart from new treaties it should now be impossible that an EU measure is simultaneously illegal under the German Constitution, but legal under EU law.

It is only this harmonization that allows both the ECJ to maintain that EU law is supreme and the German Constitutional Court to maintain that the German Constitution is supreme - both lead to the exact same judgements

The Polish Constitution doesn't have this feature. Article 23 is a clear example of a provision of the Polish Constitution that has no protection within EU law but falls within EU competence. The definition of marriage in Article 18 is a gray area (since it's unclear wether that's an EU competence), but can also lead to potential disagreements.

Nobody knows what would happen if there were a diverging judgement between the German Constitutional Court and the ECJ with no political will either on the EU level or the German level to fix that legislatively. It has never happened before.

And Poland cannot point to the example of Germany when this happens in Poland",Yurop,/r/europe/comments/8sk412/polands_president_wants_a_referendum_on_the_eu/e10xmd2/,yuropman,1529545823

2711,"&gt; What benefits may i ask?

A lot. I'm not gonna mention all of them, but here are a few:

* Being able to study abroad in Europe without paying (I'm a French national, studying in Scotland, and my education is covered by the Scottish government thanks to EU Law)

* Being within an economic bloc which has the negotiating power and leverage of all member states combined, rather than just one.

* Peace between european nations. Not to say there would be WW3 if it weren't for the EU, but being economically soldered to the countries around you makes conflict a lot less likely.

* European norms, which offer some of the best consumer protection in the world, and outsource to a higher level stuff which doesn't need to be handled by national governments.

* Being able to move and work freely, almost wherever I want in the continent

* This reason is not at all rational, I'il admit it, but I'd say there's a certain emotional attachement, too. Just as I'm proud of being within my family, proud of being French, I'm also proud of being European. And feeling like part of that big European family with so many shared values and ideals is thanks to the EU.

&gt; Good for you then. Not all people do. Imagine if this was the only thing you aggree with them on.

I don't really get your point, but even if it were, people do that all the time, all across the political spectrum. How many people vote for far right parties, just because they disagree with the way their country is handling immigrants? How many people vote for the left, just because they want to smoke weed freely? How many people vote for whatever party, just because their parents do?

Their very existence and extremist ideologies speak of the instability identity politics can cause in society (Ferguson riots for example), which it seems happens as a result of reaching a ""critical mass"" of minorities, disturbing the established order.

Of course no place on earth is 100% homogeneous, and conflict of religions/sect, class, etc... within a same ethnic group is a vastly different beast than what we're talking about here.

So it's not about pretending minorities don't exist or should be driven out entirely or whatever.

I also don't think I had any disagreement with you there about decriminalization, that's why I brought up that thread - so I could show just another person's input on how moronic it is to put someone in prison for being an addict, in a place where they won't have the opportunity to change for the better. 

That thread is just something that already supported my belief that to enact positive change in someone's life, you need to give them a carrot and not a stick - I figured it'd have more impact if it came from someone who had actually spent some time being beaten by said stick. 

Like I said, I don't like it when anyone talks in absolutes. I don't do that, I always make it a mind to question everything I might say, and I am always adamant that others do so as well. If you read what I post almost everything I say is phrased in a way to say that I might not have all the answers, the first response to you was a question - of which I asked because I wanted to have your input on something I wasn't sure about.

&gt;because when it happens out of the blue one day, and no one had a clue, it won't be a surprise to you.

It would still surprise anyone. The US is an original signatory of the GATT treaty and WTO member. That means it has agreed that unilateral tariffs are illegal and allow the opposing country to sanction in return however they please. If Trump thinks the tariffs are illegal, he can take it to the WTO, like the US has successfully done in the past. But by unilaterally placing sanctions on countries outside the WTO, he has allowed the EU legal right to sanction where it hurts the most and the US will have to pay a fine once WTO rules on the matter.


It's ironic, because the Republican party has been fighting big government intervention by all means for years, and then within half of a term, Trump would already make Stalin proud.

2895,"There is something that bothers me about all this, namely that I’m sure there is good substance to much of the criticism, but it seems to be surrounded by too much FUD and bullshit.

E.g. look at this website meant to inform about the issue: [https://savetheinternet.info/](https://savetheinternet.info/) I see several problems, but to name a few:

1. ""This ""tendancy"" could be abused to filter content that’s not in line with the companies values and interests."" What exactly would prevent these companies from doing this already? Why exactly would this be a new issue enabled by these articles?
2. ""In the future, press publishers will be required to bill for any links someone makes to their content."" I have seen absolutely nothing that suggests that links per se would in any way be affected by this. Links e.g. on Facebook that also show an excerpt of an article are another issue, but instead of focusing on that (and ignoring the fact that concerns about Facebook’s practice regarding this may actually be legitimate), the site prefers to spread information that, as far as I can see, is plainly false.
3. ""The upload filters also mean the death of the meme culture. Copyrighted material under the terms of free use can no longer be distributed without paid licenses."" So if they are terms of free use, why is the paid license necessary? I haven’t seen anything in the actual legalese that forces any copyright holder to charge for any license. If I’m wrong, why doesn’t this site point out the text that says this specifically?

Not to mention that I don’t care about memes and some people’s sense of entitlement that their memes are somehow more important than the copyright of the author of the content being used in the meme.

Then the website has a section at the bottom called ""Article 11/13 in detail"", which not only stands out because of the sore lack of significant detail in there, there is not even the actual text of the articles there.

Then how there is no mention of the fact that the extent to which a platform owner is required to offer measures for copyrighted content to be filtered depends on the size of the platform (so a small platform would not be required to spend the same resources on filtering as e.g. Facebook). No mention of the exceptions for e.g. parody work. No mention of the fact that even with a filter system in place, each takedown must be made with a specific public reasoning and that the uploader must have an easy way to dispute the copyright claim being made.

I’m sure there are legitimate issues with what is being proposed – it’s just a pity that it’s surrounded by so much FUD and seemingly unfounded fearmongering (""the Internet is going to die and the EU hates your memes!""). Makes it harder to take the actual and legitimate criticism seriously, for individuals like me and, more crucially, for the MEPs actually voting and having a say on this.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not advocating for this directive. I'm absolutely sure there are legitimate concerns. Just, please, present them properly (not OP specifically). There is a lack of nuance in all this, too much talk about memes, too much hyperbole about censorship (in the extreme case, the good old ""this is even worse than Orwell"" nonsense). I feel that's not how you reach people and MEPs to take the concerns seriously.

It also bothers me how many people are taking this as an occasion to say ""fuck the EU"" and the like - if your local government passes a shitty law, wouldn't you also blame your specific government and its parties instead of your entire country (politically speaking) or its political system?

DR terrorist groups opposed to the peace process remain the most significant threat to national security in Northern Ireland. The UK lists four DR groups: the new IRA; Óglaigh na hÉireann (ONH); the Continuity IRA (CIRA); and Arm Na Poblachta (ANP), who continue to consider violence a legitimate means of achieving their goal of a united Ireland. These groups consider police, prison officers and members of the armed forces in Northern Ireland as their primary targets. Attack methodologies and capabilities used by DRs vary across the groups with many attacks involving firearms or small improvised explosive devices such as pipe bombs. They have, however, also deployed larger and/or potentially more destructive devices such as vehicle borne improvised explosive devices (VBIED) and explosively formed projectiles. Apart from attacks on the security services, many dissident republicans are also heavily involved in criminal activities for personal gain, including smuggling and extortion.

2954,"It is a beautiful novel, it is a beautiful story: considered in 1999 as the ""sick man of the euro zone"" (The Economist, June 3, 1999), Germany would have miraculously cured thanks to the laws of precarization of the wage labour (Hartz laws) which came into force between 2003 and 2005. These reforms alone would have restored the competitiveness of companies, revived Mercedes' sales abroad - and convinced Mr Emmanuel Macron to apply the recipe in France. Fatal mistake. ""To understand Germany's success as a global exporter,"" says economic historian Stephen Gross, ""you have to look beyond its borders. This model is based to a decisive extent on the development of commercial networks with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (1).  ""And more specifically on unequal economic exchanges established with Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, a quartet called the ""Visegrád Group"". For a quarter of a century, wealthy Germany has been practicing with its neighbours what the United States has set up with its factories in Mexico: local relocation.

Firmly established between Otto von Bismarck's Second Reich and the Habsburg Empire at the end of the 19th century, the privileged economic exchanges between Germany and Central Europe are not new. Limited by the Cold War, they resumed in the 1970s in the form of industrial, technological and banking partnerships, thanks to the Ostpolitik (1969-1974) launched by Social Democratic Chancellor Willy Brandt. The fall of the Berlin Wall is the time for a meal for the wild animals. From the early 1990s, German multinationals set their sights on privatised state-owned enterprises in an atmosphere of industrial apocalypse. While the takeover of the Czechoslovak car manufacturer Škoda by Volkswagen in 1991 left its mark, the capitalist neighbour first used the existing facilities as subcontracting platforms.

To this end, it is taking advantage of an old delocalization mechanism that is as discreet as it is little known: outward processing traffic. This procedure, codified in European law in 1986, authorises the temporary export of an intermediate good (or spare parts) to a non-member country where it will be processed, shaped - perfected - before being re-imported into its country of origin with partial or total exemption from customs duties (2). After the collapse of the Eastern bloc, the expansion of import quotas from Central European countries opens up euphoric prospects for German employers. Subcontract the chrome plating of faucets or the polishing of bathtubs to overqualified but under-qualified Czechoslovakian workers? Entrust fabric to the agile Polish fingers paid in złotys and collect jackets that will be sold under a Berlin brand name? Shelling crustaceans in the neighbouring country? This is possible as early as the 1990s, as if the borders of the European Union had already been erased.",,/r/europe/comments/8sl3sw/the_holy_german_economic_empire/e108qca/,Djfred93,1529522355

2956,"From the ""Iron Curtain"" to the ""maquiladoras"".

""The outward processing traffic is the European version of the American measure that paved the way for the development of the maquiladora in the border region between Mexico and the United States (3),"" explains economist Julie Pellegrin. More than any other member country, Germany benefits from this processing subcontracting, mainly in textiles, electronics and automobiles: in 1996, Rhineland companies reimport twenty-seven times more (in value) advanced products into Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary or Slovakia than French companies. In that year, outward processing traffic accounted for 13 % of the Visegrád group's exports to the Union and 16 % of German imports from that area. Some sectors are rushing into it: 86.1% of German imports of Polish textiles and clothing follow this regime. In less than a decade, says Julie Pellegrin, ""companies from Central and Eastern European countries are integrated into production chains controlled mainly by German companies.

This arrest of nations still anchored in the East yesterday by the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance led by Moscow (CAEM, or Comecon, 1949-1991) was all the more rapid as the exaltation of the ""liberated consumer"" by access to Western products compensated for a time the disarray of the worker enslaved to the subcontracting of these same products.

As free trade agreements became tariff-free in the second half of the 1990s, outward processing traffic lost interest in favour of foreign direct investment (FDI). Multinationals are no longer content to relocate a small segment of their production, but are now financing the construction of subsidiary plants where labour costs are lower.

From 1991 to 1999, German FDI flows to Eastern European countries multiplied by twenty-three (4). In the early 2000s, Germany alone accounted for more than a third of FDI in the Visegrád Group countries and extended its capital-intensive influence to Slovenia, Croatia and Romania. The factories of automotive equipment manufacturers (Bosch, Dräxlmaier, Continental, Benteler), plastics processing and electronics are mushrooming. For, from Warsaw to Budapest, average salaries represent one tenth of those practised in Berlin in 1990; one quarter in 2010.

Yet workers have benefited from the strong vocational and technical education system in the East. Much more qualified than their Asian counterparts, they are also closer: if it takes four weeks for a container from Shanghai to reach Rotterdam, five hours are enough for a truck loaded with machined parts in the Mladá Boleslav workshops north-east of Prague to reach Volkswagen's headquarters in Wolfsburg.

At the turn of the millennium, Germany thus became the leading trading partner of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. These represent for Berlin a hinterland of sixty-four million inhabitants transformed into an offshore production platform. Of course, Italians, French and British also benefit from this asymmetrical trade. But on a smaller scale. Audi and Mercedes might take up less road space in New York and Beijing if their prices did not include low wages in Poland and Hungary.",,/r/europe/comments/8sl3sw/the_holy_german_economic_empire/e108rh4/,Djfred93,1529522382

It's possible for economy to be business-oriented, so that e.g. companies earn higher share of income than employees, which would explain GDP disparity. But when Lithuanian wages and pensions are among lowest in the EU, while consumption numbers not far from Western Europe, it would need some serious explanations.

3018,"Wrong and wrong, I can't exactly tell you that you're wrong for thinking anything. I can see why you'd think that by just looking at the legislation and that it passed in the Legal Affairs committee. However this thing has gone through the European Council and accepted it. The European Council, as you may or may not know, consists of the governments of all member nations. That means that Mrs May agreed to it. 

Additionally in the Legal Affairs committee it was the conservative, eurosceptics and the anti-EU parties that voted for it. The exception is the EFDD which was slated to vote against, the UKIP are part of the EFDD. The parties that were against it were the pro-EU ones. 

The clear tactic seems to be: Vote for legislation such as this so the general public loses faith in the EU, then cash in on the growing resentment. A tactic which seems to be highly effective judging from several replies here. 

Either way the concerning things here for Britain would be that not only did your government already agree to both these articles, the ruling conservative party voted for it in the Legal Affairs Committee and probably will in the parliament as well. Furthermore, an MEP from Labour voted against partylines and for the legislation as well. Thus it can be concluded that most likely would you not be safe from this bullshit if it came to effect.

You're arguing that the special treatment described in the document consists only of providing accommodations during the trial, and has no effect on outcomes or punishment. That's simply not true, and I can provide plenty of examples to that point.

For example, a deaf couple spent years molesting and raping a 6 year old boy. Not only did being deaf get them a sign-language interpreter during the trial, but a much lighter sentence as well. Instead of the 6+ year prison sentence the crimes called for, the judge allowed them both to walk free with a suspended sentence, and explicitly said it was only because they were deaf: https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/europe/200816/uk-sisters-rape-6-year-old-boy-for-14-yrs-court-sets-them-free-says-they-are-deaf.html

Or what about this case, where a judge decided that nonwhite child rape victims suffer more than white victims, and so ruled that rape of nonwhite children should be punished more severely than rape of white children: https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/sep/17/asian-child-sex-victims-suffer-more-than-white-children-court-rules

I could go on, but hopefully you get the idea. These guidelines absolutely impact the severity of punishments in some disgustingly discriminatory ways.

&gt; When? What judges 'looked the other way'. The case is ongoing - which is the point.

3062,"&gt; TWO years ago Poland looked on in disbelief as the British voted for Brexit. Now the country may face its own vote. Andrzej Duda, the president, wants to tackle the question of Poland’s relationship with the EU in a broader referendum on constitutional reform this autumn, on the centenary of Polish independence after the first world war. With relations between the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party and Brussels fraught, and Brexit looming, the proposal has raised eyebrows. If the referendum gets the Senate’s go-ahead, Europe will be watching.

&gt; Mr Duda, a former PiS member, has long argued that Poland’s 1997 constitution needs updating. On June 12th he proposed 15 questions spanning a hotch-potch of subjects, from social policy to food security, adding a reference to “Poland’s and Europe’s over-thousand-year Christian heritage” to the preamble. Two of the questions focus on Poland’s relationship with the EU. The first asks whether Poland’s EU membership should be constitutionally guaranteed. The other asks whether the constitution should enshrine its own primacy over international and European law.

&gt; The timing is awkward. The Polish government is locked in a protracted dispute with the European Commission, which has warned that its judicial reforms undermine the rule of law. Twenty-seven out of 72 Supreme Court judges will be forced to retire at the start of July. Time is running out: Warsaw has been given until June 26th to assuage Brussels’ concerns. If not, Warsaw might in theory have its voting rights in the EU suspended, though that remains unlikely. More realistically, the European Commission wants to establish a mechanism that could cut EU funds, of which Poland is the biggest beneficiary, for countries where the rule of law is at risk.

&gt; Neither Mr Duda nor PiS is calling for a “Polexit”. But since PiS came to power in 2015 Eurosceptic rhetoric has surged. Like Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, PiS opposes what he recently called “delusional nightmares of a United States of Europe”. “Sovereignty” is the buzz word in Warsaw. In a speech last month, Mr Duda went so far as to liken EU membership to the 1795 partition of Poland, which wiped the country off the map for 123 years.

&gt; Poles remain broadly pro-European. Some 70% of them think that EU membership is good for the country, above the EU average of 60%, according to the latest Eurobarometer survey. Few want Poland to leave the EU (11%, compared to 83% for staying in). Meanwhile, enthusiasm for the referendum remains low. Even PiS has kept its distance, fearing a poor turnout.

&gt; Still, Mr Duda’s questions have caused a stir. Among liberals, they have stoked fears that PiS is leading the country towards Polexit. Meanwhile, on June 16th, the (tiny) National Movement announced efforts to lead Poland out of the EU. Mr Duda argues that enshrining Poland’s EU membership in the constitution will “strengthen” its presence in the bloc. Yet, as Britain’s referendum shows, he is playing with fire.",,/r/europe/comments/8sk412/polands_president_wants_a_referendum_on_the_eu/e0zzubv/,Ummland,1529515133

We jettisoned our utter reliance on Christianity to guide and shape our ethical and moral characters as a continent quite a long time ago and embraced a more individualistic and rational outlook on religion, economics, society and adopted a stronger belief in reinforcing the freedoms-from and freedoms-to. Not in every single case obviously, and Western society isn’t strictly perfect, but we wrenched ourselves away from dogma quite painfully long enough ago that to even imagine going back to a time when Christianity dictated almost all of our cultural mores is anathema to us.

For these people, there is no such instinctive negative reaction against the idea that their religion controls or influences every aspect of their existence and of their societies as a whole. For them, it’s actually a positive thing. Expecting them to cut ties to a religion that also masquerades as a social and economic framework alongside its strict moral and ethical rules was, to put it bluntly, fucking stupid of us to expect. One only has to speak to apostates of this religion to see how people that go against the groupthink are treated in their home nations. To be a minority religion in these places, even a minority sect of the same religion, is often just as dangerous a position to be in as leaving the dominant creed altogether. How on earth did we expect these people to live happily alongside various different ethnic and religious groups peacefully with no issues whatsoever?

The original Commission proposal actually had the words 'content filter technology' in it, so there's no wonder people are talking about internet censorship. 

\&gt; The law itself doesn't mandate automatic  take downs, only automatic filtering of publicly available information  that people willingly post on content sharing services. This is meant to  provide right holders the tools required for identifying probable  copyright violations.

How is this not censorship? Generally speaking there is two forms of censorship, a priori and posteriori. A priori is when there's a filter that decides whether you can publish or access the content at all. Posteriori is the notice and take down method, or when you say something like deny the holocaust and after that you go to jail. Then there is a due process where some kind of a judge takes a decision whether the material can stay up or not. The a priori prevents you to say it or access the stuff before the crime has even taken place. Both constitutes as censorship. Just because you agree with the censorship that's being implemented, doesn't make it any less censorship. I agree with the censorship of child pornography, that doesn't mean that the whole function of blocking or taking down child porn is somehow not censorship.

That 'tool' that this is supposed to be providing doesn't really exsist, isn't perfect and will not be able to make a judgment with regards to what is freedom of parody or what is a quotation. In order for a filter to work, it'll have to go through a lot of content. That'll take lot of computational power. Normally they use a finger printing technology, where a copyrighted content is 'fingerprinted' and then in order for finding the possible copyright violation you've scan all the material. That's basically surveillance, just in order to find this one probable copyright infringement.

# Re. point 2., 

Again, wrong. The whole sharing of memes is sharing of parody. Just because a member state is allowed to make an exception or limitation on parody then it doesn't mean that the exception is automatically positive for you. It only means that the member state is allowed to make an exception in those cases, but it doesn't have to. The UK didn't have freedom of parody until 2014, after their copyright reform. In Iceland (which is EEA, adhering to this too), doing parody films, songs or whatever, is strictly speaking copyright violation. In Germany you're only allowed to use quotations as a means to demonstrate criticism another's work, so in Germany the 'memes are quotes' will not fly.

Saying that they're banning ""memes"" is of course just to get people thinking. But let's look at a more realistic version of what could happen:

In France, there's no such thing as freedom of panorama. The lights on the Eiffel towers are copyrighted and all reproduction, including making pictures with your phone is illegal. You and your partner are having a romantic dinner and then go for a walk and take a selfie with the Eiffel towre at night. You try to upload it, because it was like your wedding anniversary, but oh no, it didn't get through the censorship filters. Is that fair? Is that proportionate? Then the question is, you're back in Romania and try to upload it again, because it's a great pic, will the user platform adhere generally according to the strictest national law in the EU and apply it everywhere? Or will Romania have the right to share that eiffel tower at night? How do you feel about this scenario? 

# Re point 3.: 

Again, you're quoting the council version. The Parliament version has no mention on small or micro entities. In that regard the Council version is better. Getting the 'small and micro' into the Council text was difficult, so if the Parliament doesn't have it, it might get voted out during the trilogues for all I know. So, your comment here isn't valid, as you're referring to another document that's currently not being discussed.

# Re. point 4:

How are you going to get a license from all rights holders? I'm a right holder, you're a right holder, there are 32 European countries that will have to adhere to this, and some of them have complicated right holders organizations. Also, the paragraph you're referring to is, again, the council version. The current proposal reads:

\&gt; 1. ***Where*** information society service providers*** offer users content storage services an***d*** provide the public wit***h access to*** content and where such activity is not eligible for the liability exemptions provided for in Directive 2000/31/EC, the***y shall take*** appropriate and proportionat***e measures to ensure the functioning of*** licensin***g agreements concluded with rightholders.*** The implementation of such agreements shall respect the fundamental rights of users and shall not impose a general obligation on information society service providers to monitor the information which they transmit or store, in accordance with Article 15 of Directive 2000/31/EC***.

In order to understand what's being said there you've to understand also the E-Commerce directive, and how article 15 works. Julia Reda explains it [here ](http://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2018/06/18/julia-reda-discusses-current-proposal-directive-copyright-digital-single-market/)and those concerns have been echoed by the UN special rapporteur David Kaye, which can be found [here.](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4516209-OL-OTH-41-2018.html) 

The main issue, so I quote Reda:

\&gt; Mr. Voss tries to lull citizens into a false sense of security by  stating that no general monitoring obligation shall exist wherever  Article 15 of the e-commerce directive is applicable. Unfortunately,  **Article 15 of the e-commerce directive is only applicable to those  providers that benefit from the hosting safe harbour under Articles 12  to 14 of the e-commerce directive, whereas any platform that falls under  Article 13 of the directive on copyright in the digital single market,  according to Mr. Voss’ own proposal, cannot benefit from the hosting  safe harbour.** In other words, his text confirms that the ban on general  monitoring does not apply to platforms under Article 13, they are  therefore required to install filters. It is very questionable whether  this proposal is compliant with EU law, as the CJEU, in the Scarlett and  Netlog cases, has grounded the ban on general monitoring in the Charter  of Fundamental Rights.

I'm happy to discuss the pros and cons of the Council version, but that's already been decided on and is not the dossier that was being voted upon. I hope this clarifies some of the misunderstanding that you assume is 'misconception' or 'fear mongering'.

3248,"&gt; “Equal treatment does not mean treating everyone the same” I believe was the direct quote.

Direct quote from who and about what? Any context?

Are you quoting a Tory MP talking about polygamy? If so, he actually said: ""Equality does not mean that we should treat **everything** the same.""

&gt;Polygamy already exists in this country. The Government recognised in 2007 that there were more than 1,000 bigamous or polygamous marriages in England and Wales. That was identified by Members and peers in the House of Lords. The unintended consequence of the Bill will be allowing the introduction of polygamous marriages, as advocated last night on television by Peter Tatchell. Therefore, I will vote against the Bill on behalf of almost 1,000 of my constituents who have made clear their opposition.

&gt;Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr Burrowes), I am angry that I have defended people who are homosexual, including many who have left the Chamber, who then deride me as a bigot, and send me text messages saying that I am wrong just because I do not support them. I bitterly resent that.

&gt;Equality does not mean that we should treat everything the same. We certainly do not have the right to redefine marriage over the heads of our constituents.

3274,"&gt; Content creators and human beings alike, should hold themselves to a higher standard and refuse to produce crap for simple monetary gains.

You tell this to my landlord who doesn't care _how_ I get the money, he just expects his rent payment every month. I would full well love to produce high-quality, informative content, write long-form features and get deeply into meat and juice of whatever it is that I'm covering - I can do this and it gives me great satisfaction to produce a decent, all-rounded piece with multiple angles and thorough coverage of all possible issues.

Unfortunately, people don't care about this - if you do this you're preaching to an almost empty room and you're spending time, effort and funds (original research is not cheap, man - involves visiting people, a lot of traveling, a lot of content aggregation from various sources etc.) with incomparatively low return of investment made. In simpler words: you generally just don't earn enough money to make it worth your time, and that's because people just don't respond and engage with it to a satisfiable extent.

It is what it is, man - crap or dumbed down/simplified content, call it what you want to call it, bottom line is that _nobody_ lives off high-culture the whole time. A lot of people actually _do_ want, need and seek this ""crap"", as you allowed yourself to call it: when they come home tired after work or are on their lunchbreak or are on their way to work they don't necessarily want to engage their brain cells too much, what they want is either something that will uplift them and feel less miserable on their commute, or they want a succinct and distilled form of news that will allow them to get an idea of what's happening right here in their country, without requiring to plough through dozens upon dozens of paragraphs of text. There's a reason why there's less and less of long-form journalism out there, and whatever of reasonable quality is out there is relatively pricey and paywalled.

Again - not my or anybody else's in the media fault, really - there's always been need for cheap entertainment no matter how far in the history you go to. The whole thing about ""30 years ago music was better"" or ""TV was better"" etc. etc. is just [Survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) in action, nothing else. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯",,/r/europe/comments/8sgus3/copyright_update_article_11_and_13_just_passed/e0zjjbd/,TheRealDynamitri,1529500830
3275,"&gt;the locals asked for help 

not the locals.

Flooding the labor market was great for the **owner class**, and great for the ""guest workers"" who came. For indigenous workers it just meant a weaker bargaining position.

And initially the deal was as follows: you can come here, work for a few years, earn 10 times as much as you could earn in Anatolia, then go back and be the richest man in your ancestral village.

Left-wing governments changed that deal to the the disadvantage of indigenous Germans, and to the benefit of left wing parties as well as of course the former guest workers, who realized that even being ""oppressed""(LMFAO) in Germany is safer, healthier, all-around better than being rich back home in Anatolia.

The elites sacrificed the well-being of the native population in order to buy immigrant votes.

This is false.

The [new version of the draft](https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/voss.pdf) stipulates that users should also be involved in the process of defining best practices for how these things should be implemented.

&gt; Member States shall facilitate, where appropriate, the cooperation between the online content sharing service providers, **users** and rightholders through stakeholder dialogues to define best practices for the implementation of the measures referred to in paragraph 1 in a manner that is proportionate and efficient, taking into account, among others, the nature of the services, the availability of technologies and their effectiveness in light of technological developments.

&gt; this is already the case in Youtube, you just seem to not be aware of it.

You are ignoring the provisions of the new law and are assuming that all sites will work exactly how Youtube currently works. The new law is meant to fix many of Youtube faults which I've mentioned above.

&gt; I'm telling you that using a phrase such as 'a reasonable period of time' while not in fact defining what constitutes a reasonable period of time just means that the meaning of the phrase will have to be battled up in the courts

Courts have nothing to do with how laws are written. You continue to make vague and unfounded claims about things which you clearly do not understand.

&gt; The proposal is essentially just saying there has to be some instance that people can complain about these measures, which does not necessarily have to be a court but it can be, and since many countries likely do not have the resources or the political will to set up entirely new authorities for this, it's very likely that this is a task that will just be handed to the court-system

Technically you still have Complaints Systems on facebook et al (there is even a way to appeal on YT to be fair), but is it _mandated_ that the Complaints are actually considered and an exhaustive answer is provided? 

I've done Content Production for 10+ years, my experience is that by and large it just ends up in a black hole of whatever CRM a company employs, and you're lucky to get a a canned answer after a month saying ""Yeah but no, it's not going to get restored"" or whatever.

I've been doing some back and forth with facebook earlier on this year, kept getting canned answers from everyone, mononyms like ""Jack, Intellectual Operations Facebook"" and no actual e-mail addresses because the @ were tokenized, i.e. they were directly tied up to the Case ID which means that once they decided to close the Case there was no way to get any further (other than opening a new case and going through the motions all over again, ad nauseam). UMPG was and still is abusing the DMCA takedown system, they run amok and just shoot anything that is even remotely related to what they own any percentage of copyright on as an example. There is a way to appeal that via a dedicated Rep or an Appeals Form, but barely anyone ever answers or the answers are rejections by default in 999 times out of 1000 with no justification - they even tell you outright ""Our decision is final and cannot be changed"" or some other BS like this which is of no help or resolution really.",,/r/europe/comments/8sgus3/copyright_update_article_11_and_13_just_passed/e0zdw6p/,TheRealDynamitri,1529493408

3361,"&gt;1 - Youtube does not justify take-downs, whereas the new EU law makes this mandatory.

It's not quite as simple. Youtube does 2 kinds of takedowns basically based on copyright. The automated contentID takedowns which are done purely on an algorithmic basis, and manual DMCA takedowns by users.

Now, based on what I understood from the quotes you provided in your linked comment about the proposal, an automated algorithmic removal of content _might_ be illegal under this, but it is not clearcut. The text says:

&gt;Rightholders shall duly justify the reasons for their requests to remove or block access to their specific works or other subject matter.

Now, look at a system like contentID: it works by allowing copyright holders to upload their material into the system which then creates a hash of the work, say a song or a piece of video. When new content is uploaded the algorithm checks the content against the contentID database and if it finds out that there's a match to copyrighted content, it will be blocked or demonetized.

Now, under a system like this the reason given by Youtube to the content creator whose work is blocked is: 'Your content is in violation of the contentID system and contains copyrighted material'. _Absolutely nothing_ about the vague wording of the proposal states that such a reason would not be sufficient if this becomes law. It just mandates that there must be a reason given, it says nothing about what kinds of reasons or processes are acceptable, nor does it state that automatic hash-based removals are illegal.

Secondly, even if automated takedowns would be illegal on the platform side itself, there's nothing about this law which prevents the copyright holders from creating a system like that themselves which files an automated 'manual' takedown notice (equivalent to a Youtube DMCA takedown notice that can be filled manually by anyone).

&gt;2 - Youtube doesn't have any systems in place to allow users to challenge take-downs.

Incorrect. There's a system of appeals for both contentID and manual DMCAs, but the main gripe people have with both of those systems is that they're insanely slow and cumbersome and lack human oversight. If your content gets taken down or demonetized by the algorithm, it may take from days to weeks to get it overturned, and seeing as how most of the views (and hence, most of the ad-revenue) is usually made after a video is published, this creates a situation where a content creator can end up losing the majority of his/her income from a video of ads are disabled on it for days by the algorithm when it's published.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/8sgus3/copyright_update_article_11_and_13_just_passed/e0zdwg3/,ZenOfPerkele,1529493421

3429,"Food price levels highest in Denmark, lowest in Poland and Romania 

In 2017, the price level of a comparable basket of food and non-alcoholic beverages across the EU was more than twice as high in the most expensive Member State than in the cheapest one. Price levels ranged from 62&amp;#37; of the EU average in Romania and 65&amp;#37; in Poland, to 150&amp;#37; of the average in Denmark, followed by Sweden (126&amp;#37;), Austria (125&amp;#37;), Luxembourg (123&amp;#37;), Finland (118&amp;#37;), Ireland (117&amp;#37;), Belgium, France and Italy (all 112&amp;#37;). 

Alcohol and tobacco most expensive in Ireland and the United Kingdom 

Price levels for alcoholic beverages and tobacco showed significant variations between the EU Member States. The lowest price level in 2017 was registered in Bulgaria (56&amp;#37; of the average), ahead of Romania (69&amp;#37;) and Hungary (70&amp;#37;). At the opposite end of the scale, the highest prices were observed in Ireland (174&amp;#37;) and the United Kingdom (157&amp;#37;), followed at a distance by the three Nordic EU Member States – Finland (139&amp;#37;), Sweden (127&amp;#37;) and Denmark (123&amp;#37;). It should be noted that this large price variation is mainly due to differences in taxation of these products among Member States. 

Restaurants and hotels more than 3 times more expensive in Denmark than in Bulgaria 

Restaurants and hotels is another category where large differences in price levels were observed. Price levels ranged from 60&amp;#37; or less of the EU average in Bulgaria (45&amp;#37;), Romania (53&amp;#37;) and the Czech Republic (60&amp;#37;) to 151&amp;#37; in Denmark and 146&amp;#37; in Sweden.

3440,"&gt; Which country's laws apply if a German posts an image owned by a French person to a website owned by a Luxembourgish company operating on an Austrian domain?

All EU members have to apply EU directives, but yes, they do allow each country to implement the specifics as long as they are within the directive's stipulations.

The content sharing platform is supposed to obey the laws of the countries where it has a legal presence. Users need to remember that, by using a certain service, they automatically agree to their terms and conditions which may be bound to the laws of another country.

The only things that have no borders are user rights. GDPR, for example, is mandatory for all sites that have EU users whereas the new EU directive on copyright in the digital single market only applies to content sharing services that legally operate in the EU.

This means that if you register an account for a content sharing service that only operates in the US, the new EU directive doesn't apply to them.

Regarding your specific example, the new EU rules apply to the site because it's owned by a company in Luxembourg.

Content sharing platforms are not supposed to block or remove any content without the ""relevant and necessary information for the application of these measures"".

The German's post will not be removed or blocked unless the French right holder files a legitimate take-down request. The post will not be removed if it's a meme or other form of caricature, parody and so on. This is decided via arbitration by the site's employees. If the post is deemed a copyright violation, it will be removed and blocked and the reasons behind this decision are to be made public. Even so, users will be able to challenge this decision via complaints filed on the site as this feature is also mandated by the new EU law.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/8sflvy/the_eu_is_about_to_end_everything_thats_good_and/e0zac7g/,adevland,1529486211

3463,"&gt; You're certainly not wrong.  That was a huge moment - your politicians should have fought harder.  But the soft power is still there.  Everyone except the EU respects Britain.  Britain is not a ""normal"" country.

The irony of an American, a citizen of the nation that  delivered the moral wound to British Imperialism saying the UK should of fought harder to keep its Empire. 

It was “fighting too hard” in the first place that resulted in Great Britain losing the American colonies under the Treaty of Paris in 1783. That concession came after one of the most humiliating military defeats in Bristol military history, the US war for Independence. 

If Great Britain and King George III had simply been even SLIGHTLY more diplomatic and fair with the American colonies. It’s entirely possible GB (now the UK)  never would of faced that military embarrassment that resulted in the United States leaving Great Britain by successfully defeating their attempt to invade the new nation and the attempted involuntary repatriation by military force. 

Had that never occurred it’s arguable that other British colonies wouldn’t of pushed so hard for independence or autonomy either. Even if they did it wouldn’t of been nearly as quickly as it actually happened. 

I mean from 1776 it was literally less then 2 centuries from the world’s largest Empire upon which the sun never set to complete legal dissolution. To be exact it was 155 to 176 years, from the American mortal wound being delivered to the complete death of the Empire. 

If you go by the absurd and delusional British date of 1997, it’s still only 221 years from the US declaring independence till the last sting breath of the Empire. 

Pissing off the American colonists was a bad decision in the long term for the British Empire. But such is the fate or imperialism, one day you’re on top of the world and one seemingly minor mistakes eventually leads to the end of your national empire. 

As the French say, c’est la vie. ; )

Real answer: because EU accession is bigger than one government. The argument is that the fate of countries is decided over time and by aligning with the EU we can influence them in positive ways. Bulgaria and Romania were taken is as members 'too early' as well, based on this logic.

If the EU did not give countries like Serbia (or Bulgaria at the time) a perspective of membership it is likely they would develop away from the EU rather than improving to a point that is on par with European standards.

3489,"Unfortunately I'm not sure this is a discussion I'm able to fully have in English, but fuck it let's try.

You can't just act like this is only about our migrant policy, because that's just bad faith. Why are Syrians coming ? Why are Afghans ? Why are malians ? Because there are conflicts in these places, conflicts *we* have a hand in. People seem to think that supporting migrants means that we want more of them. That's not our end goal and have never been. I sincerely wish people didn't need to flee their country and come here.

They leave because the lives they have in the place they lived in aren't sustainable anymore. It can be war, ecological changes, tyranny, and so on. They would leave with or without the Aquarius to help them out. They know drowning is a possibility. They go through Libya although being enslaved is a possibility. There is desperation in these people minds ; a desperation that most of us in Europe or in the US don't know.

Now the question is : what are we supposed to do ? 

Leaving your family, your friend, your culture, everything you've ever known, isn't something easy. it's not something you feel great doing and are thrilled to finally arrive in Europe. It's a life of misery, abandonning most of the things that makes you **you**. Being a refugee isn't fun. I wish we had none. 

But they exist. And in some cases, we have a direct responsibility in their misery. (Lybian war, Syrian chaos, Afghanistan that still is plagued with terrorist groups). I'm not saying we're responsible for everything, but we need to take our share of this burden. The vast majority of the refugees stay in nearby country and we only have to deal with a drop in the bucket. That's absolutely wrong to imply that everyone is coming to Europe. Shutting down our borders and being cruel toward people coming in, sending them back to this very misery they ran away from isn't going to fix any problem. It's just going to blind us from it. People will keep trying to come and people will still flee from their country.

And I think that is the wrong path for humanity to take.

&gt;France has been leaking for decades, and distributing soups and cushion won't change the issues that will be coming in the future. Though you will sleep tonight thinking you are an angel.

I'm very sad that you have such a simple reasonning. If you think the alpha and omega of my view is that I want to feel good, you're wrong. I'm not fixing the systemic issue behind this crisis, but at the end of the day, neither are you or any right-wing politician. Yeah, the real problem lies elsewhere, but in the meantime, people still seek a haven and a place to live in. Your answer is to just shut the door and look elsewhere while pretending this is none of our problem. And that's not what I want humanity to look like.

What with the new EU laws coming things might change but currently it is possible to own automatic weapons.

In fact, with the laws we had before it was possible for anyone to get an automatic weapon as long as the person handling the permit agrees that they can get one. I know a guy who got a RK62 on his 17th birthday. Wasn't even a collector. It was few decades ago and the local police just felt that he was safe enough to own a select fire assault rifle. 

Realistically though, unless you are friends with the police officer handling your permit they only give you a permit for an automatic weapon is if you have registered as a weapons collector which is a strictly controlled thing. You have to determine the purpose of your collection (can't just be ""I like guns"" you have to have decide the scope of the collection like ""firearms used by the military of country X"" or ""old European hunting rifles"" etc. and if the guns don't match that collection they won't give you a permit on collection grounds.) and you must have protected storage for your guns and clean criminal record to be given collector status.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8s82nc/firearm_ownership_in_europe_and_the_rest_of_the/e0z74yy/,Kilahti,1529479470

Turkey and syria might have same religion but their ethics and beliefs are totally diffrent (lol in turkey neighbour cities can gave diffrent views about religion).

Yes turkey has historically had dominion over the areas these people are coming from but it doesn't mean turks have connections with those areas like i said turks have ethical/cultural (etc) diffrences with syrians.

Europe has taken lot more than just syrians: turks did that too iirc there are afgan paki and shit ton of other refugees.

Europe invests a lot more on refugees to integrate them than Turkey does. Crucially, Turkey actually gets financial help with funding from the West, in the order of billions: I'm not going to argue eith that basicly turks dont have funds to do that with so many people.

A country with many problems and too many guns makes more dead than a country with just many problems. I don't find that so hard to believe.

3619,"That being said, this is politics.  And in politics, what matters is public perception.  You don't change human nature, you change what politicians are doing.

Hollande and Merkel, for example, took point for the EU during the Russia situation, and during a number of other situations.  Even if it's merely public perception -- and I can't see enough of the sausage being made at the EU to know whether that is the case or not -- it seems difficult to me to understand why they do that.  They can still have their say behind the scenes, but if the EU is acting as a bloc -- and on sanctions decisions, it *must* -- surely it makes more sense to have the man in front of the camera be Juncker?

France and Germany have often led European integration efforts.  Perception or not -- and here, I suspect that it is less simply a matter of perception -- it seems to me likely that this will create a view that it is France and Germany setting the direction.

For example, when was the last time that one saw, say, an Italian-Polish-Swedish project that Germany and France later joined?

That's not criticizing them on the matter.  Maybe it's good to have leadership, you know?  Or maybe you don't want tight integration, like the Brits.

All the way back in history all the successful well liked Russian leaders where all the same. People can say corruption and staged polls all they like but that's just simple minded.

Like the other guy said it's also Russia's economy has improved a lot while under Putin.

Corruption has gone down a lot since then as well. 

People are better off now then they have ever been in Russia, that also helps. A lot of that is credited to Putin's government weather that is correct or not is up for discussion.

3649,"**The Netherlands:** 

NL are the highest net payers into the EU budget right now and are fiscally conservative, even a bit more than Germany. They have recently become the de facto leader of the fiscal hawks as Germany began to adopt the role of the middle man. As such, if the Dutch agree the fiscal hawks are most likely convinced as a group. 

The Dutch neither wish to pay more than they already do, nor create a transfer union. With this, they are in line with most of the CDU/CSU electorate in Germany. On the other hand, the NL would loose the most from a crashing Eurozone as much of Europe's trade flows through their cities and ports. 

Rutte has begun extra-conservative on these issues and gradually reduced his rhetoric on the matter. He is still on the level of the CDU/CSU, so do not expect him to agree to the Eurozone budget as it stands now. While the Dutch are opposed to unjustified spending, they are not complete dogmatists. I believe a good case can still be made to convince them of the merit of a Eurozone budget.

That being said, FR/DE left open the size of the EZ budget. Common wisdom holds this is because of unresolved differences between France and Germany, but I believe it is because here the greatest adjustment towards a compromise with the Dutch can be made. 

For the Dutch to agree, I believe we must have a budget which is a) limited in size, b) is investment focused, c) subject to strong control mechanisms and d) financed in ways not putting extra burden on Dutch taxpayers. The first three already shone through yesterday, but of course the details are unknown. The last one might be the most difficult point to achieve, yet Germany already showed readiness to pay more to protect its deep economic interests - a long-term successful, stable Eurozone.

Edit: I should mention one additional development - *America*. At least since Iraq, the US have entered a slow fall from grace for them in the eyes of its European allies. The Iraq debacle, NSA scandals, now Trump's general behaviour culminating in his crumbling commitment to NATO/G7; all of which have made European allies wary of disintegrating US support. I cannot faithfully gauge the Dutch reaction to this, but the German reaction has been one of absolute terror. 

Let's be frank: as of last week, our transatlanticists are no more. This is relevant because they dominated our entire government policy since the FRG's establishment, even putting the German-US alliance above common European interests. As Merkel put it, our loyalty is now first towards Germany, second towards Europe. Before Trump, this still was ""1. Germany, 2. America, 3. The rest"". 

The Dutch are dependent on a world order assuring the free flow of goods across the oceans. Without it, there is no Dutch economy. If they feel that the Americans are no longer willing to uphold such an order, then the Dutch have no other option that to integrate themselves fully into a European structure *and make sure it has the ability to defend open seas globally*. 

The size of this task implies a federal EU. Thus, if the past two weeks have finalised America's fall from grace in the Netherlands as it did in Germany, the Dutch reluctance to stronger European co-operation might have evaporated in the light of crumbling American hegemony.

----------

**Italy:**

I know less about Italy than the Netherlands, simply because I know less about both the government and their voters. I have an idea what drives the latter in certain issues, but I am not entirely sure. In effect, what we have in Italy is the complete opposite of the Dutch in many areas - with the explicit exception of net payment. While the Italians are not the highest net payers, they still are net payers and a G7 economy.

You can see Italy's position as ""More French than the French"" when it comes to a Eurozone budget. If Italy had its wish *during past governments*, we'd have a Eurozone budget three weeks ago with a huge % of the EZ's GDP behind it. The issue is, they do not have a government as they did in the past. Most recent talks with the French nevertheless suggested a similar stance as before. 

The main difference however is the Italian's willingness to compromise. During past governments, I would have had no doubt that whatever deal could be struck with the Dutch, the Italians would agree to on the basis of ""Something is better than nothing"". With the populist government, I am not so sure.

They may wish to tank the Euro and find *something* to dislike as justification to block a deal, which you can always do if you look closely enough. They may feel insulted at the little concessions the North gives them. They may feel an honest, pragmatic need for deeper integration than what is being suggested. I simply do not know, but it is for this reason that we must take special care to observe the Italians' reactions. They are the wild card, but at the same time it is far from clear that they will automatically block a reform as many external observers would claim.

For all we know, Italy's support was already gained on Monday when Merkel assured the Italians of her support in all matters regarding migration. Such a deal is very much in the spirit of Italy, even if it is rather un-German. The economic necessity and shifting political landscape might have forced Merkel to support Italy in many topics, ranging from migration and youth unemployment as declared on Monday when Conte visited Berlin, in order to gain Italy's support for Eurozone reforms.

In the end, let's not forget that even populists might understand that something is indeed better than nothing. Whatever the Eurozone's budget size, Italy *will* profit since the budget's main intention is to assure long-term convergence of economic performance across the bloc with Italy lagging behind since the financial crisis.",EU nation: /r/acteuropa,/r/europe/comments/8s9y01/merkel_macron_agree_euro_zone_budget_in_new/e0z3bgk/,DFractalH,1529472933

Remember that YouTube doesn't block videos because YouTube wants to block videos.  YouTube would probably quite happily display everything and anything that its users can get its hands on -- why not, as it benefits them?  YouTube blocks videos because it has a business presence somewhere with laws that require it to block something.  Maybe it's copyright law, or maybe it's law on some sort of prohibited content.

The issue here is an EU directive.  If you're in the EU, you're gonna be affected as an individual.

I guess that you could, say, get Kiwis to host content for you -- the Linux dev team used to host crypto content on a server not in the US in the bad old days back when the US treated crypto software as a munition and required an arms export license to move it out of the country.

Maybe it's a problem of being a commercial operation -- if you don't sell anything, you might be able to avoid doing business in a country.  But then you need to figure out how to fund this.  Are you going to personally donate the bandwidth costs?  Because huge numbers of people streaming a huge number of videos means a lot of bandwidth consumed.  I suspect that the operating costs for even a major open-source project -- say, kernel.org -- are dwarfed by the operating costs incurred by YouTube.

Other presidents have been pointing out the same issues for a long time and little to no improvement has happened.  Trump is willing to take action to bring about real change.

Trump was elected as a change agent and Hillary represented more of the same.  Obama did not manage to fix any of these issues.  It is time to try new things.  If our allies actually appreciate what American has and continues to do on the world stage then it is high time that they step up and contribute more.  If they do not then they have no real right to be offended by Trump making demands on them and they were allies at best in name only.

Note that this applies only to licensed dealers.  So if Smith goes to Bob's Gun Shop, Bob's Guns will have a record that it sold a gun to Smith.  But if Smith then sells his gun to Jones, that data will not be recorded anywhere, public or private.

So you cannot simply compile a comprehensive database of gun ownership via hypothetically seizing records of all gun dealers in the US.

3752,"Part of the problem that your statistics don't show, that more recent reports by the Danish and German governments identified, is that despite the vast majority of refugees looking for work, they're not being hired. Employers cited the biggest issues by far for hiring refugees as being internal beaurocracy, legal concerns over refugees' residence status and the years it was taking the German government to process the asylum applications. 

Germany doesn't want to dump large numbers of refugees into jobs that don't require language skills, as they had done in the past, because that further isolates them and makes it more likely they won't pick up the language. Further, they found that only a third of those who applied for work training programs were accepted onto the.

I wouldn't call you a racist for the statistics, frankly I wouldn't call you racist at all, but this remark ""they’re hard working, polar opposite of the immigrants in Europe"" suggests you don't really understand the problem, you're just blaming an entire group of people for problems which for many of them are out of their direct control.

* Turkey shares the same religion as the refugees

* Turkey has historically (via the Ottoman Empire) had dominion over the areas these people are coming from

* Europe has taken a lot more than just Syrian immigrants

* Europe invests a lot more on refugees to integrate them than Turkey does. Crucially, Turkey actually gets financial help with funding from the West, in the order of billions.

So no, the narrative of 'muh poor Turkey' is BS and ignorant.

Like I just said,
""Other presidents have been pointing out the same issues for a long time and little to no improvement has happened. Trump is willing to take action to bring about real change. Time will tell what that change is but the definition of insanity is to keep trying the same thing and expect different results.

Trump was elected as a change agent and Hillary represented more of the same. Obama did not manage to fix any of these issues. It is time to try new things. If our allies actually appreciate what American has and continues to do on the world stage then it is high time that they step up and contribute more. If they do not then they have no real right to be offended by Trump making demands on them and they were allies at best in name only.

Sometimes it is better to know where you stand in a relationship and who you can actually count on even if the answer is not what you would have preffered.""

Again if they have not and will not pull their weight and only focus on criticizing us and acting against us then how exactly are they allies?  because they say so right before we give them stuff?  Because they were happy to hang out with Obama as long as he made no real demands on them?

3833,"Sure they have more power than the other countries. They are larger. But this does not mean that they have a majority at the relevant places where decisions are made and it does not mean that two countries can impose their will on the rest of the EU in such fundamental matters. 

More generally speaking, it does not imply that the others are not heard. When France suggests policies, other countries' voices have typically already been taken into account and will continue to do so, and when German does so, the same happens. This is in particular clear in this case here because Germany represents the wishes of the Northern countries (some of which have a more extreme stance than Germany), while France represents the Southern countries (some of which have a more extreme stance than France). So if these two reach a compromise here, it will come close to a blueprint of what an all-across EU compromise will have to look like and is an important step forward regarding the further development of the Euro zone. 

This was also the general point of Juncker when he commented on the agreement today. 

And finally, as always the details will be haggled out on many long days and nights during the typical EU compromise meetings.

Depends on quite a few factors, but generally when it comes to loans, increasing the period increases the cost of the loan, in return for lower annual payments.

&gt;Incidentally, that would be a good way to work around NPT restrictions as well, since all EU members are signatories to it, but the EU isn't.

How is the EU not being a signatory help? France transferring weapons to the EU would be a breach of the NPT, the only difference is that the EU wouldn't also be in breach (in the way that an NPT signatory would be as a recipient).  I'd also assume that there would be some international objections to the EU becoming a nuclear weapons state in its own right.  Nuclear sharing (the US approach..) would probably be about as close as you could get.

3888,"&gt; Its a step in the right direction

A step in the right direction to stop every random WORLDWIDE NGOs to pick up people? Yes.

&gt;  but this needs to stop too.

ITA's CG under EU/UN law's to pick up people? No, as an Italian first and European in 2nd and human beings at 3rd, I can't allow this shit, if I can, I'll save a life, ALWAYS

 ... my ""recondite"" wish is, every CG/Military Marine from EVERY EU27 or OTAN nations that operates in that area (in according to SAR and stuff) if they pick up people in distress, they can bring on Italy's ports, and within 24hrs they MUST have any kind of transport for the people rescued to get to the same nations' that made the rescue...

Example, if a German/French/Hungarian/Norwegian/Finnish/Romanian/NL (insert ANY NATION IN THE EU), ships/crew (be it an APPROVED NGOs, Military, OTAN, CG...) go for first to rescue, they MUST GUARANTEE that the people they rescued gonna be processed in THEIR own country... So, always as an example, a Sweden ship rescue 900 people, I, as an Italian, I'll grant SWE for a safe port (cuz is the close one, or the same could be for Malta, France, Cyprus, Greece, Spain...), at one condition, Sweden should guarantee Italy (or other nations that give a port...) that the people they rescued will be sent and processed for any refugee's checks (always under EU laws for refugees...) in Sweden (Swedes, I take you guys as an example, ok?) with a flight/ship/bus whatever... Again, as an Italian, I'll be more than glad to give airports/facilities to make this procedure as fast and comfortable as possible... but you can't dump ALL the ""refugees"" on Italy's or Greece's coasts, c'mon... let's be pragmatic for just a second; If all the 27s (kinda sad for UK...but, another story...) want to sport the ""humanitarian"" flag, just act...

3905,"&gt;The Balcerowicz Plan (Polish: plan Balcerowicza), also termed ""Shock Therapy"", was a method for rapidly transitioning from a communist economy, based on state ownership and central planning, to a capitalist market economy. Named for its author, the Polish minister and economist Leszek Balcerowicz, the plan was adopted in Poland in 1989.  
&gt;  
&gt;\--  
&gt;  
&gt;**Among the members of the commission were Jeffrey Sachs**  
&gt;  
&gt;\--  
&gt;  
&gt;There was a temporary drop in output, but growth was eventually achieved by 1992. Similar reforms were made in a number of countries.  
&gt;  
&gt;Most economists agree that without this shock therapy, which sacrificed short-term gains for long-term growth, modern Poland would be a much poorer country. For example, **Poland's annual growth rate between 1989 and 2000 was the highest of all post-Communist economies.**

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balcerowicz\_Plan#Criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balcerowicz_Plan#Criticism)

Here you have nice tables comparing selected post-soviet economies\^

&gt;Sachs's ideas and methods of transition from central planning were adopted throughout the transition economies. He advised Slovenia (1991) and Estonia (1992) in the introduction of new stable and convertible currencies. **Based on Poland's success, he was invited first by Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev and then by Russian president Boris Yeltsin on the transition to a market economy**. He served as adviser to Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar and Finance Minister Boris Federov during 1991–93 on macroeconomic policies.  
&gt;  
&gt;\--  
&gt;  
&gt;**Sachs himself resigned from his post as advisor, after stating that he felt his advice was unheeded and his policy recommendations were not actually put into practice.**\[22\]\[23\]  
&gt;  
&gt;\--  
&gt;  
&gt;Advocates of shock therapy view Poland as the success story of shock therapy in the post-communist states and point out that **shock therapy was not applied appropriately in Russia**, while critics point out that Poland's reforms were the most gradualist of all the countries and compare China's reforms with those of Russia\[4\] and their vastly different effects.

Economies of all post-Soviet states definetly didn't go into freefall and seems like Russia just failed to stick to their shock therapy plan.",,/r/europe/comments/8sav2s/poll_half_of_russia_wants_putin_for_president/e0yisb5/,wishpetersonwasmydad,1529449997

3944,"Yeah, but that's kinda meaningless in a parliamentary system, like most of Europe uses -- the party coalition that controls the legislature also controls the executive.

Europe's systems aim for judicial separation from the legislature, not executive/legislative separation.  So if the bar is ""you need to have two branches to dominate the third"", you're setting a bar that is simply impossible from the get-go for Europe to meet, barring restructuring the system of government.  Now, someone can want that, and that's fine -- personally, I suspect that given their youth as systems of government go, no form of democratic government today is likely to be optimal -- but then the complaint is a different one than ""PiS pisses me off"".  It's more along the lines of ""let's talk about developing new forms of democratic government"".

EDIT: Also, as to the parent comment that I was responding to, I'm a little suspicious that the reason that the US Constitution is as important as it is because the US is a federation, and as such, it defines the split in power between the states and central government.  That means that the central government cannot be ""higher"" than it -- you *intrinsically* need to have a ""level of authority above the federal government"" in a federation, else you just have a unitary government.  A constitution might be seen as useful for other reasons in unitary governments -- maybe you don't trust any individual administration with absolute authority and want to place some sanity limits on what it can do without going to the public -- but it isn't going to be as core to the thing, I think.

My suspicion is somewhat-supported by the fact that the only time that I recall seeing someone citing constitutional text on this sub other than Americans, it's German users, and Germany is also a federation.

Would be interesting to go talk to people in other federations, Australians and Canadians, and see whether the constitution also plays a large role.

EDIT2: Also, the EU is a confederation-becoming-a-federation, where the separation of the central government's powers relative to state governments is also important, and I do see people referencing EU treaty text there.

That being said, I will concede that it's possible that language is a major role here -- people mostly speak English on this sub, and the official text of most constitutions are not English, so it's hard to talk about the official text here.  I dunno how much people talk about it offline or in other contexts.  I've cited English translations of the French and Swedish constitutions before...

EDIT3: Re: ""the only time I've seen"" comment, I *have* seen British users talking about limits on Parliament, and they have some sort of unusual concept of a constitution that's formed from custom and number of different documents but isn't written in one place.  So before someone calls me out on that, I suppose that referencing some British legislation might count as citing constitutional text.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8s79ot/theyre_trying_to_break_me_polish_judges_face/e0yjf37/,vokegaf,1529450637

In it there is a claim made, that Russia's great performance at Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics (because they as the only nation could inject whatever they want without hesitation and it wouldn't get checked) gave Putin a wave of approval, that he used to annex Crimea, and the result of that was of course us vs them mentality and people chose to stand behind Putin and Russia rather than the West attacking them for Crimea.

If you look at [Putin's approval over time](https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2016/02/blogs/graphic-detail/20160206_woc909.png) there's a huge injection right about when it dips to the lowest it's ever been, then Sochi and Crimea happens.

Quote form Washington Post:

&gt;Just over two years ago, as Russia headed toward the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Putin’s poll numbers were slumping. Only 61 percent of Russians approved of his job performance — high by Western standards, but the lowest for Putin since shortly after he took office. After Putin annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, then stoked tensions with the West to their worst since the Cold War, Russians took their minds off their struggling economy and positioned themselves resolutely behind their leader.",,/r/europe/comments/8sav2s/poll_half_of_russia_wants_putin_for_president/e0yjz9y/,wishpetersonwasmydad,1529451195

He's a memorizer, not thinker, being asked to make decisions about things that go **way** over the farmer's disputes over land and cattle that he most likely spent the majority of his career dealing with. 

He managed to claw his way up to the highest echelons of the Portuguese Legal Representatives Oder by virtue of his ""respectable"" age, his connections, and his media-friendly ""Berlusconi-like"" populism.

4030,"Greenlandic politicians have recently made the claim that Denmark should continue to give Greenland money for a not yet stipulated time even if they declare independence. They said it was their right as a colony under Danish rule. 
A troublesome statement as Greenland ended its status as a colony in 1953 to become a region of Denmark. From 1979 it voted for home rule status as an independent territory. In 2009 it further distanced it self from Denmark. 

In 2000 Faroese politicians met with Danish politicians to discuss and finalize the rules for a possible declaration of independence. Something that was officially recognized in 1992. The demand from the Faroese was that Denmark would continue to pay 650 million annually for 63 years and annul any debts of the Faroese ""state"" owed to Denmark. At that time about 4.4 billion.

The Danish PM said the money transfer would be be outfaced within a 4 year period and then stop completely if the Faroese declared independence.

-----

MOSCOW — I’ll admit it: The thought of working and living in Moscow for almost six weeks conjured thoughts of being tossed back in time or dropped onto a set of “The Americans.”

Gray and unfriendly. Barren food shelves and shadowy figures. The joy and passion of the World Cup doused by Russian gloom.

What were you thinking, FIFA? What was I thinking?

I was wrong. Moscow is the vibrant heart of this soccer celebration, welcoming tens of thousands of visitors — every last one, it seems, stroll the Red Square area as if it were an ocean boardwalk — and inviting outsiders to a world they’ve probably never seen.

Languages mix like ingredients in a hearty bowl of borscht: Russian and English, German and French, Japanese and Korean, Portuguese and Spanish. The common bond: a love of football/soccer and a love of life.

Aside from who is going to win the World Cup, the question I receive most from people back home is: What’s it really like in Russia?

I can’t speak about the other 10 host cities (though I will hit St. Petersburg this week) or the country at large. I’m sure remote cities and rural areas are strikingly different and less prosperous. I’m not going to pretend to be a Russian expert after nine days in country.

At times, I have had trouble reconciling the wonders of the city and the actions of the Putin government. Perhaps visitors to America also confront dueling feelings; I don’t know. What I do know is you can appreciate history and engage in a new culture while remaining cognizant of world affairs and concerned about injustice and cruelty.

And so a new adventure has commenced. Moscow looks and feels like any major European city, except with Soviet-era relics: white- and blue-collar workers packing subway trains on a Monday morning, teenagers in western brands live-streaming an acoustic band performing on a pedestrian road, open-air cafes serving coffee and pastries.

There are burger shops, sushi restaurants and Irish bars. (Every city on the planet has an Irish bar, right?) Uber works, though with a smaller fleet of drivers than Yandex, the Russian ride-hailing giant. Apple Pay is common.

There are European sports cars and Japanese-made sedans, but not many U.S. brands. There is an English-language news outlet (Moscow Times) and public high-speed wireless, though it’s best to choose your connection wisely and use a virtual private network.

There are lovely parks and signs of decay, world-class museums and industry. Georgian food is an undiscovered wonder. The Moscow River snakes through the city. The Metro system (the big red M is everywhere) has 13 lines, 245 stations, 227 miles of service and ornate decor fit for a private collection. An employee sits in a glass booth at the bottom of many escalators, some of which are so deep and long, you can’t see the other end.

[Moscow Metro (Steven Goff/The Washington Post)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IU8mrQnlogkhxgZAF2iSQvtbacc=/480x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5ZCK7CUEIU5TNISRKZ6NS25FEM.jpg)

Every ride is the same cost, regardless of distance (less than a dollar). Wireless service is accessible deep underground and newer cars offer USB outlets. (Are you listening, WMATA?)

Still, it’s not always easy being here. In an expensive city, price-gouging during a major event has exacerbated the cost of housing. That happens at every World Cup. Traffic clogs arteries and neighborhood streets alike.

Communication is difficult; English is not as prevalent as in most major cities. Russian is hard and reading Cyrillic is like trying to decode a Cold War message. English signage and announcements in Metro stations guide visitors, but there are barren spots that spark moments of panic.

You think you have trouble operating your TV and cable system at home? Try doing it with Cyrillic instructions.

I’m confronting more daily obstacles than usual on World Cup assignment because, unlike my previous soccer journeys over 24 years, I have bypassed, for the bulk of the tournament, a hotel’s comfort and support. I rented an apartment.

It sits near the historic Arbat District, a pedestrian street lined with rowdy bars and souvenir shops running parallel to a breakneck, six-lane street shadowed by high rises lit in World Cup colors and logos. Two miles from Red Square, this is perhaps Moscow’s Times Square.

My building, probably built in the 1970s, is dreary on the outside, functional and renovated inside. I’m saving money on not only the nightly rate but on laundry services. (Twenty dollars for five pairs of socks? Love ya, Marriott, but . . .) I’ve got a pint-size washing machine and a drying rack erected near sun-splashed windows.

One late night, when the side-loading appliance got stuck on one cycle for hours and began filling with water, I began to panic; I’m going to Russian prison for flooding an apartment building. The next day, a repairman came by. Crisis averted.

On the ground floor, there’s a French cafe with special-edition tortes featuring green frosting and a silhouette of a soccer player.

Next door, a restaurant trying to appeal to American male visitors advertises “2 Beers Bud with a Double Sandwich New York for Men Only.” I went with the veggie wrap and mango lemonade garnished with a chile pepper.

An adjacent building houses a multiplex showing Western films. On the outer ends, the upper walls feature fading Soviet mosaics. At street level, a guy in a cupcake costume distributes fliers.

Groceries are available near the British Embassy (and Sherlock Holmes statue) at an upscale chain called Azbuka Vkusa, which is Russian for “Our produce is as beautiful as your Whole Foods’s but for twice as many rubles!”

Shoppers earn unofficial World Cup trading cards manufactured by a company called Top Trumps. Just in time for the Fourth of July, one can purchase “The Original BBQ Marshmallows,” packaged in a bag adorned with a U.S. flag and Mount Rushmore.

The busy commercial stretch is the source of debauchery as soccer fans of diverse backgrounds converge nightly. The crowds disperse when the sun begins to rise, which, at this time of year in a northern city, is at 3:43 a.m. (In St. Petersburg, it’s 10 minutes earlier.)

Visitors eat and drink at Black Star Burger, Steak It Easy, El Tacodor and Apocalypse Pub. There’s a hookah bar and temporary World Cup museum.

On Friday, Sports Illustrated’s Brian Straus and I watched the Spain-Portugal match on a screen the size of a former Soviet republic. It hung inside an upscale nightclub/music hall converted into a viewing venue. We sat with two Mexican fans dressed in green.

With each of the six goals, dance lights were activated, causing temporary blindness. Before kickoff, patrons had been greeted by five orange, Wookiee-like characters. They were accompanied by a witch. It was terrifying.

Down the way, near the Burger King, sits the Museum of Death. I must visit.

Basically what I'm saying is that I'm worried that Turkey might misuse this situation to shift the demographic balance in Kurdish-majority areas. I'm not saying this is guaranteed to happen. If it doesn't and Turkey handles it correctly - than fine by me.

Unit symbols are printed in roman (upright) type regardless of the type used in the surrounding text. They are printed in lower-case letters unless they are derived from a proper name, in which case the first letter is a capital letter.
An exception, adopted by the 16th CGPM (1979, Resolution 6), is that either capital L or lower-case l is allowed for the litre, in order to avoid possible confusion between the numeral 1 (one) and the lower-case letter l (el).


Unit names are normally printed in roman (upright) type, and they are treated like ordinary nouns. In English, the names of units start with a lower-case letter (even when the symbol for the unit begins with a capital letter), except at the beginning of a sentence or in capitalized material such as a title. In keeping with this rule, the correct spelling of the name of the unit with the symbol °C is ""degree Celsius"" (the unit degree begins with a lower-case d and the modifier Celsius begins with an upper-case C because it is a proper name).

4299,"Yes. 

Most of this evaporated after 1935 but earlier there are a few prominent examples. 

The [Association of German National Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_German_National_Jews), which called for the elimination of Jewish ethnic identity through Jewish assimilation, comes to mind especially. Their main idea was that total assimilation was the proper answer to antisemitism.

In a nutshell the members of this group firmly believed that they were *German* above all and that someone like Hitler would never do something against them, believed that he only made his antisemitic talking points to stirr up the masses.

Quotes from this group are rather eerie in retrospect:

&gt;""We have always held the well-being of the German people and the fatherland, to which we feel inextricably linked, above our own well-being. Thus we greeted the results of January, 1933, even though it has brought hardship for us personally.""

&gt;""The election campaign must not be a struggle of religious conceptions, it must be a decisive struggle about our Germanness!""

The group was dissolved in 1935 and their founder [Max Naumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Naumann), an army captain during WW1, was arrested. He was released after a suicide attempt and later died of cancer in 1939.
___
There was [Hans-Joachim Schoeps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Joachim_Schoeps) and his ""German Vanguard"" (""Der deutsche Vortrupp""). He famously asked for the ""clear separation of German Jews and non-German Jews under a united authoritarian leadership"".

Due to his links to people like [Otto Strasser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Strasser) (part of the initial left-wing of the NSDAP) he was put under more and more pressure and fled to Sweden in 1938, a few weeks after the *Reichskristallnacht*.

His parents stayed in Germany. His father died in a concentration camp in 1942 and his mother was murdered in Auschwitz in 1944.
___

Other more prominent examples include [Erik Jan Hanussen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Jan_Hanussen), an Austrian ""clairvoyant"" (assassinated in 1933, presumably by SA troops), [Erhard Milch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhard_Milch), a German Field Marshal who was convicted during the Nuremberg trials, [Helmuth Wilberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_Wilberg), General of the Air Force or [Bernhard Rogge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Rogge), a vice-admiral.

To my knowledge most of these people were outcasts among the majority Jewish population, especially after things got worse and worse. 

Reasons for Jewish support for Hitler all came from similar angles: That he promised to fix things, they assumed he'd never touch them (because many saw themselves as Germans first) and that all his talk is just that: talk to gather votes. One also shouldn't forget that many of these people or their parents served in the German military during the first World War, it seemed far-fetched for many at the time that *their* loyalty and ""Germanness"" would ever be questioned.

What would be certain is if *any* form of severance from the Republic, such as a border, was imposed on NI against the will of the people there, it would be opposed, cameras, checkpoints would be damaged/destroyed and/or blockaded, there'd be a campaign of civil disobedience. It's unfortunately not hard to see how that could excalate, particularly considering Britains previous reactions to [protests](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_(1972)

The border, such as it is, is not a natural one as it is in many other countries, it goes through farms, houses, villages, down the middle of roads. 

[This](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Northern_Ireland_Assembly_election_results_by_constituency%2C_2017.png) is a map of the NI 2017 election results, any border would be through Republican/Nationalist areas, and will be resisted, understandably so.

[From the Guardian:](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/29/where-did-the-greek-bailout-money-go)

&gt;Only a small fraction of the €240bn (£170bn) total bailout money Greece received in 2010 and 2012 found its way into the government’s coffers to soften the blow of the 2008 financial crash and fund reform programmes.

&gt;Most of the money went to the banks that lent Greece funds before the crash.

The bailout was used to save western banks that had bad loans in Greece. But I guess it's hard for you as a proud German to accept that your government lied to you and that the money was used to bail out the bankers that caused the crisis in the first place.

&gt;“The bailouts have been for the European financial sector, while passing the debt from being owed to the private sector to the public sector.”",Romania,/r/europe/comments/8s8k7y/greece_to_get_up_to_15_billion_euros_after_third/e0xkm4h/,bobama123,1529421238

Morocco could work, Algeria is too unstable, and Tunisia can't really handle that many people and is also not super stable. Giving Morocco a billion dollars to do something Europe could do by just not letting people in would  be wildly unpopular.

&gt; 2: Rescue the boats, and have them dropped off at the camp in whatever country, where they stay indefinitely or agree to take money to go back home. If legitimate refuges, apply for EU asylum at the camp. 

People will get on the boats, take the money to go home, just go back to the coast, get on another boat, rinse and repeat until you've made a stupid amount of money.

If you try to tell the kid his mommy and daddy are bad people he'll double down on his love and affection towards the parents because""who the hell are you, a stranger, while mommy and daddy take care of me"". And he is kind of right there, since you are not going to adopt the kid or take him in for the rest of your life, no matter how bad you feel for him, and some orphanage might be even worse than the occasional beating he gets from parents. Now what you can do is keep in touch with this kid, so in the off chance things are degenerating even more, at least the kid will have somewhere to run to safety and not end up in a street gang. And maybe by being present in his life you are showing the kid that beatings are not normal, that there are houses where respect and love are not empty words, and maybe when he grows up and becomes independent from the parents, then he will have a better family life and start a family without abusing his own kids. 

The general population of a country is like a perpetual child, they rarely stand up to their parents/leaders (this happens when parents really mess it up and kids feel life-threatening consequences, or if the kids get duped by really bad-influence ""friends"" that will later take advantage of the parentless rebel child).

On top of that and unlike Germany, US really is a military power that can stand to Russia, have both the means and even the resons and is a much more serious ally.

Germany seem to have a joke of a military and is treating the EE as some sort of secondary EU rank while doing much of nothing to improve their military security (or that of EU in general) while Russia occupy neighbours territories at every decade since the early 90's up to couple years ago. Still is seen as a great economic partner and EE countries treated as being crazy to not like Russia or not being more appeasing to them

Not even France seem to bring too much on the defense table, they needed  American  logistic support even for operations in Lybia or in some deserts in Africa vs some local militias. 
And they almost sold modern military landing ships to Russia, to be used in Baltic and Black Sea, only after a big scandal they ended the deal.

How can EE don't see US as a closer ally in this case? As long as Germany (and even France) see EU as only their toy, with different speeds and where it matters only their short term interests things will just go for worse, unfortunately for Europe in general, who will fade away as importance in today world history.

4537,"&gt;Everyone knows: Protect Armenia from Turkey.

That is probably the worst excuse I have ever heard, Russia is protecting Armenia from an imaginary ghost under the bed? We all know the monetary incentives that Armenia gets for providing Russia a platform in Armenia. Armenia also gets some Russian goodies (weaponry) besides monetary funds. 

&gt;Turkey is a military threat to all its neighbours and has acted one way or another towards them including towards Armenia through Azerbaijan as a proxy.

That is a bullshit claim and you know it. That is exactly like claiming Russia is a military threat to all its neighbors. Is Russia a military threat to Kazakhstan, to Korea, to Mongolia, to China? I think not.

Turkey has legitimate clauses for being in Syria, considering thousands of innocent Turks have been killed by terror attacks and mortar shells which have destroyed their homes and livelihood in border cities near Syria. Turkey had a legitimate clause for entering and protecting the livelihood of Turkish Cypriots - note, Turkey was not condemned by the international community for preventing further massacres against Turks, but are condemned for an 'occupation.' Turkey and Greece also have territorial disputes over some Aegean islands, which are recognized by the international community to be ""disputed."" Lastly, Turkey has posed no military threat against Armenia. 

Armenia will hash up any type of threat or paranoia to justify their close buddy-buddy relations with Russia and Imperator Vladimir.

&gt;So why are you questioning the base. The US has bases in Turkey because of NATO. Same thing.

NATO has military bases in Turkey for a very clear threat that was apparent during the Cold War: Russia

To this day Russia has been fueling the conflict in Syria, has been playing **both** sides of the coin - by arming and supporting Kurdish groups that are an existential threat to Turkey as well as supporting Bashar Al-Assad, neighboring groups which either pose territorial or regional threats to Turkey. 

So I would argue Turkey has far more legitimate reasons, unlike Armenia in this case. Russia is protecting Armenia from Azerbaijan at this point, while using their military base in Armenia as a forward proxy for their military in case of future wars.

&gt;Azerbaijan, Russia and Turkey obviously contributed nothing!

Sarcasm isn't warranted when you aren't considering the facts. Please inform me as to what Turkey provided for Azerbaijan during the war on Nagorno-Karbakh... Did Turkey offer military support to Azerbaijan? Did Turkey intervene and fight on behalf of Azerbaijan? None of these are true.

Turkish level of support for Azerbaijan was almost on the same level as Iranian support for Armenia. Turkey perhaps provided the same level of support as Israel did for Azerbaijan. So did Israel fight on behalf of Azerbaijan or contribute immensely as you would like to believe Turkey did?

&gt;And it's only in your view that it is like Abkhazia - the Nagorno Karabakh case is different from the other ex-Soviet conflicts according to the eyes of the international community.

Blah blah blah, one of the lead negotiating team in the OSCE is Russia, a country who supported Abkhazia and south Ossetia. France as well has historically sided with the Armenian people on many issues, and there is a large Armenian diaspora in France. The United States is almost as convoluted when you put aside actions by the Federal Government and consider Armenian lobbyists have successfully been able to have legislators pass the recognition of the ""Republic of Artsakh"" in various states, when this opposes international rulings over this matter. Though, who ever said that the Federal government can't be bought out either?

&gt;know this very well so why are you spreading this here?

What happened in Nagorno-Karabakh is very similar to what happened in Abkhazia. Let's not forget Armenian support in Abkhazia, and let's not forget that diaspora Armenians throughout the world came to Nagorno-Karabakh to fight in an illegal war.

Both used systematic concentration of these minorities into camps. Be it concentration camps or gulag's or however you want to call them. Both had the intention to force the people there to work to death.

Would you be for or against the adaption of decimal time?

* Hours
* Centi-hours (the new minutes)
* Milli-hours (the new seconds)

That would be with keeping 24 hours in a day. So what about making it so there's 100 ""hours"" in a day?

What about switching to Kelvin as temperature measurement so we can get rid of this arbitary offset in Celcius?

What about not using 360 degrees in a circle? Instead using the gradient measurement of 100 degrees in a right angle.

I also bet you still use litres, but why when you have cm^3 ! That's two units for volume. You also probably know what a tonne is.

These aren't SI units, but they're all acceptable for use under the metric system. Would you be in favour of trying to eradicate all of these? Some of those you could start with today! (Well, mostly just not using litres or tonnes).

----------

This is a semi serious question, but more something to make you think. Would you be willing to give up these things you've grown up with for the sake of a more consistent measurement system? Would you be willing to go through the short term chaos that some of these changes could make?

Sure if you ask them they'll say ""he is pious, he builds roads"" and so on. But those reasons can change if you prove that he doesn't really abide by the rules of Islam or the infrastructure is having problems. They'll just make up different reasons to justify their love. You'll give them irrefutable proof that they did something bad. **They will reject reality** to justify their love. There was a man online who literally said that the official gazette (governmental newspaper that gives news about the decisions the government is making) is lying and false.

So what is the real reason then? There is none. He is Erdoğan, the ruler of our country. We love him, because we love him. Every channel on TV has his face during news time. An alternative is unthinkable. It's hard to explain but that's just how it is. A man once said ""if I catch my mom in bed with Erdoğan, then the whore must be my mother"" I can't explain this in terms of logic. Do you think just everyone hated Stalin and Hitler?

Nope. Could't do it. It is impossible, and not because one considers himself a democrat. This is an evil place, and it is so by design: the designers wanted you to feel tiny, oppressed, an insect crushed by the might of the State, and by god that they managed it. I don't like cliches like ""this is an evil place"", but this place is evil indeed. It makes you feel crushed, observed and judged by that huge cross. I felt positively relieved once I left. My gf telling me stories of how her grandfather spent a summer in the 40's driving trucks full of dead bodies uphill to deliver them to the crypt didn't help either.

Franco did not support ""free-market"", he instead supported [autarky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autarky) and in fact tried to implement it during the first decade and a half of his rule. He believed Spain could be a completely self-sufficient, closed economy with absolute no dependency from the exterior. Production of food and resources was controlled by the state via the Spanish Labour Organisation (known as the ""Vertical Labour Union"").

There was certain freedom (you could have your own business, it was not as strict as in communist regimes), but it wasn't until the 50s when it became open to all form of businesses (including foreign) and not until the 70s when there was a complete liberalisation of the internal market.",Basque Country,/r/europe/comments/8s6chy/spain_to_exhume_francos_remains_and_turn_site/e0x47sl/,metroxed,1529400170

Putin has cultivated an image of a powerful and influential leader that takes no shit from anyone, that is not to be trifled with and that can manipulate the west to promote the interests of his country. This comes in sharp contrast with the spineless clowns that have been ruling Greece for decades. In the recent years Greek governments have failed to protect even the most minor of Greek interests during EU negotiations.

And necessary. Not everything that is traditional is useless; often, such traditions exist for a reason. In this case, it is a 'standard greeting form' which allows states to prevent any (real or perceived) insult. Of course this greeting form is somewhat arbitrary, but that is not the point. The point is that *some* standard diplomatic greeting exists. It could be with pink hats and blow-up giraffes, it would still serve the same purpose if people accepted it the same way.

You *do* have to greet people somehow. By standardising the procedure, everyone involves knows what to expect and what to do.

This starts of easy, but can radicalize. 

The beauty of democratic societies is that free speech allows for different opinions. But for populists, different opinions weaken their own claims and false promises. 

So they always attack different opinions. It almost always starts with the media and the free press, because they are vocal is depicting the lies populists spout. 

See, besides claiming that they represent the will of the people, populists always give easy solutions to vastly complex problems. Just build a wall, throw all muslims out, leave the EU. But easy solutions for complex problems are a lie. The press usually is very focal in showing this. 

This makes them a prime target for the populist who can claim they oppose their clear (but false) solution and even more, oppose the will of the people! How dare they! You see this real clear with Trump and his attacks on the press. They call out his bullshit, he calls them fake news and anti-american. 

In the end every dissenting voice, and thus free speech, undermines the legitimacy of a populist' claim. Populists oppose that and thus oppose free speech. ",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/8rxlmo/frances_front_national_who_support_the_eus/e0wxmb8/,KoenQQ,1529387319

First reason: Because his logic is bullshit.  He sees a fact: ""Nordics have more success at thing.""  And he reaspns: ""Nordics are better at thing.""  As if success or failure depends only on intrinsic ability.  He doesn't ask if maybe Nordic countries have encountered fewer obstacles.  They don't even have natural disasters.  If they switched places with Haiti, would they still be successful?  I would not assume so.

Second reason:  They're not even that successful.  The US state of New Jersey has almost 2x the median income of Norway, and is also larger than Norway in population terms.

5103,"&gt; Again, there is no fair use in Europe. For the rest, I’m not sure you understand copyright law properly… Just because another directive introduces the exceptions and limitations doesn’t mean that they don’t apply in this case. Laws have to apply in parallel to one another.
&gt; 
&gt; 

What i meant was that you cannot read this without reading the complementary ones.


&gt; It doesn’t have to say filters. Filters or human moderation (which is just as bad, though more expensive for the provider) are the only way a provider can abide possibly by the obligation created by this provision. This has nothing to do with the current state of the technology, it is simple logic: you cannot remove illegal content without notification, except through automatic or human monitoring.

The point is that if technology currently doesn't allow filters and a smaller company doesn't have the manpower to manually check uploaded content, what's the ramification? Does the smaller company close shop or does article 3 apply? 


&gt; Again, I really don’t understand you. We know what is protected: all works that amount to the author’s own intellectual creation. This has been laid out by the CJEU in its case law since the Infopaq decision.

Yea I get this. On principle, I don't mind if an author doesn't allow me to read their work online and I think this right needs to be protected. It gets hazy in other scenarios though. Is a video of a public flashmob copyright infringement because a song plays on the background? Is it copyright infringement if you happen to have a picture behind your selfie that is ""intellectual property""?

I don't mind rightholders disallowing people to view their content online. If there was a ""perfect"" filter where you just couldn't upload such material I would be fine with it I think. The problem is that in the effort of doing so currently, they may do more harrm than good.

&gt; I think (if you’ll forgive me) that for what you’ve written here, you don’t have a good understanding of copyright law or the way harmonisation of law at the European level works. Very often these notions are not defined in the directives. This does not mean that they do not have specific meanings. In a lot of cases the CJEU has also given us harmonised definitions.



I'll read your link. I am more used to reading ""financial"" directives such as GDPR or MiFID as they align with my line of work and I expect roughly the same treatment. I do understand that the players are different in this case.

5128,"&gt;What if I told you that famines had nothing to do with communism, just that the policies they used to set quotas were messed up?

Imagine that you are a farmer. You own your own land and keep 100&amp;#37; of your production. Now there is a quota that says you need to hand over 50&amp;#37; of whatever you produce to the government, or you need to hand over 100&amp;#37; of what you produce to the government and must produce at least X amount.

Explain to me why you would work as hard? What is your benefit or incentive to do this? Beforehand, you had an incentive to produce as much as possible because you would sell it (the more you produced the more money you make). Now you have no incentive to produce anything since the government will just seize it from you. Your only way to survive is to lie to the government that you couldn't produce enough and just keep what you could produce.

Famines were not just in the USSR. Communist famines happened in China and North Korea too when agriculture was collectivized. It's common sense. When you remove the incentive to produce food then farmers produce less food.

My grandparents were farmers, my family still owns our farm. If the government came over and just told us that we no longer owned our own farm, but we had to keep on producing food and hand it over to the government, we would tell them to fuck themselves. We would just lie and hide our food, or we would stop farming the land because we would have no reason too. We're not communists. The vast majority of the peasants who worked their own land weren't communists. Nobody would support a system that plans on seizing their own land from them. Why would any farmer want to work for free just to prop up a system that is stealing from him?

It's easy for you to imagine that collectivization works, but only because you don't own land. It's easy to imagine that you can manage other people's property better than they can. It's hubris to think that those same people will go along and just listen to what you order them to do after you confiscate their land from them and order them what to do like slaves.

And I will repeat this, collectivization was slavery. Production quotas were slavery. You are ordering people how much crops to produce and to give it all to you.

The Constitutional sent 5 court orders to the Catalan government before the referendum, [Puigdemont answered taking this picture](https://twitter.com/krls/status/851751028022280192).   

Courts are nice, but without police officers enforcing their orders and arrest people that disobey them are useless. And most police officers will disobey court orders if the politicians in charge of them tell them to do so.

But, nobody can take over the Spanish government. If the Spanish parliament wants to disobey the Constitution and tolerate a government breaking the law courts can't do anything.

Court orders are only stuff that judges in a building write, they are powerless by themselves. You need politicians wanting to enforce them.

Learnings from last year. TLDR: Law is only relevant under the threat of police force and prisons if you break it.

5165,"&gt; That makes no sense. What does that even mean lol? You're saying that Greece can't claim Scottish history cause Scotland doesn't represent Scots in Greece. In the same way, FYROM can't claim Greek history cause it [Greece] doesn't represent Greeks in FYROM. I don't know what that representation you speak of has to do with anything. If FYROM represents its people and they claim Greek heritage, therefore FYROM can claim Greek history, in the exact same analogy Greece represents its people and if some Greeks claim Scottish heritage then Greece should be able to claim Scottish history. That's not the case though, either way.

You are overcomplicating this. And the issue is not representing Greeks but rather N. Macedonians. Greeks are already represented by Greece. N. Macedonians of today carry out genes of ancient ones, partially, and they are already located in the fucking region which is more or less ancient one. Of course they will be associated to the ancient Macedonia therefore.

What does Australia and Scotland have to do with this? You are diverting the discussion to some weird ends and they having comprehension problems. I suggest stick to the region so that it's easier for you.


&gt; Again, FYROM doesn't represent Greeks either. Wtf? lol.

I am not sure at this point whether or not you are having comprehension problems? No one ever claimed N. Macedonia represents Greeks? Wtf? 

&gt; Australia has people that have ancestral roots in Greece, and those people are represented by Australia since they're Australia citizens, so can Australia as a country claim Greek history? No. Having people with different roots in your country doesn't give your country the rights to that history. It's a pretty damn simple concept.

You are again comparing diaspora people with the locals. Wtf.

&gt; No it's not but those cases are probably few 

Oh really? Based on what, your guess?

&gt; Does their arrival in Greece automatically make Greece eligible to Turkish history cause it now has people that had mixed with Turks? 

They don't consider themselves Turks, so why would they claim anything Turkish? Wtf? N. Macedonians consider themselves to be the descendants of ancient Macedonia, so they surely can associate with it, along with Greeks of Greek Macedonia.

&gt; And yet the Achaemenid Empire is not counted as part of Turkish history. It's persian history. Some Turks might have similar roots but their state's history overally is quite different. If you can't understand that i can't help you any further.

No one claims this anyway? People already acknowledge Ancient Macedonia being a Greek state, we are talking about the people that live NOW. Turks in Iran surely share Persian heritage and even DNAs throughout the centuries of mixing. If living 1000 years there doesn't make them eligible for being a part of Iranian heritage, I don't know what else does.

&gt;  Plus none of these countries claim another country's history, so because some Arabs in Egypt and Tunisia believe that they have anything to do with Carthaginians and ancient Egyptians don't cause any issue. 

It's not ""some Arabs"", what are you even talking about? Hannibal is considered to be national hero in Tunisia, just like Alexander in Macedonia/Greece. Egypt is even more nationalist when it comes to this. The government teaches Ancient Egyptian history, and guess what they have on their money in Egypt? Yeah. Fucking Pharaohs. 

&gt; differences between contemporary culture and ancient Greek culture, the similarities and connections are undeniable. 

Greek culture today is similar to ancient culture of it as Egyptian to its own. Go figure.

&gt; Also by your logic it would be incorrect from North Macedonians to claim ancient Macedonian history because the Greeks in the 6th and 7th century are also vastly different from the Greeks in the 4th century BC.

You were the one who said N. Macedonians have a different culture so that they can't claim the ancient one, not me. I don't give a shit about who has what culture today, since none of it relates to the ancient one anyway. What counts is where people live, and what they feel. I gave the examples to counter your argument, not to base mine. They show that Macedonians are not the only ones who do not have the ancient culture, yet to feel attachments to the antiquity.

&gt; Which is again, a false notion because there is nothing to feel nostalgic about because of obvious differences.

Like what? The only difference is the language lol, which is also the case in Mexico, Egypt and Tunisia. So they can't claim their antiquity either or what?

&gt; I'm still waiting for the evidence about how South Slavs are genetically the same as Greeks. You keep mentioning this but so far you haven't backed up this claim once.

Are you expecting an evidence that shows there is an overlapping DNA between **two neighboring people**, especially when one did colonize the region of another for centuries? The whole Balkan peninsula has been a melting pot for centuries. Slavs and Greeks have been Orthodox, intermarrying and mingling for centuries. Plus, Greeks have been colonizers and settlers in such a vast region in Balkans and Middle-East. If they don't share the genes with the locals there, I wonder what they did when they settled. Teleported their locals from Athens? Fucking hilarious lol.

Not against it, but there are no votes to end the practice in the US senate to ensure that anyhow, so it's a moot point to make.

5287,"&gt; What priorities?

It was a euphemism. It's obvious that not all Greeks can agree with everything that the Russians do all the time, hence the need to see the other side (Western) as well.

&gt; I honestly do not understand why Greece is in the EU.

For geopolitical reasons, mostly. Also, because the world moved on to an era of larger, international constructs.

&gt; Always the victim in trouble yet never the one who is responsible for its hardships.

This is a common misconeption. It's also your opinion based on no evidence. Aka bullshit. The economy is indeed a victim of the austerity measures, numbers say so, even the IMF admited it. But no one blames solely the West for Greece's hardships, not even the portion of us who are against the measures themselves. I've said it a million times. The image of the fat, lazy, Greek asking for money to drink alcohol and fuck whores is a lie at its very essence, in every word. In fact, it resembles the stereotype of other, 'civilized' nations, but that's another issue.

&gt; Why not just leave and get closer to Russia?

I'd like to believe that we're not leaving due to the geopolitics of the area. Sadly, our relationship with Russia is facing a troubled time due to our own mistakes and I don't know how close we can get.

&gt; After all, your cultures are similar.

You've probably never been to either Russia or Greece, if you believe so. Closest, culturally, countries to Greece are the Balkan and the Southern European ones.

&gt; Both countries are Orthodox and corrupted.

Quality trolling/shitposting. This implies what? That the rest of the EU is not corrupt? I've never really understood people like you. You have the whole internet at your disposal, you can search before you spit shit around. I mean, you could see that there are also EU countries far more 'corrupt' than Greece (by this stupid index standards) and some that are around the same position as Greece and are top names.

5354,"&gt;I said Balkan folks have been mixing with each other as the entire region has been a clusterfuck for centuries. Invasions, occupations, atrocities, you name it. In a region which is so fucked up, you cannot have a pure race. You can seek purity in Iceland or Amazons, but not in Balkans or Benelux.

First of all I'd like to see some actual evidence that South Slavs, namely North Macedonians and Greeks are genetically so identical as you claim but going back to the main point, I'm not sure why you're bringing it up because genetics is completely irrelevant to one's ethnic identity as ethnicity is constructed by social factors. As we have agreed previously, an ethnic Turk can consider himself a German if he was born in Germany and has been living there his entire life. However North Macedonians claim ancient Macedonia as their history and their identity, yet they're not Greeks, don't speak Greek and don't share the same culture and this is where my problem lies, North Macedonians deny historical facts and claim that no, ancient Macedonians weren't Greeks, they were Macedonians just like us. So yes, individuals could trace their genetic roots back to the past, although I really, REALLY doubt that modern North Macedonians could trace their ancestry back to ancient Macedonians ( who again were a completely different ethnic group), however a country can't claim another country's history when it is not based on historical and archeological evidence. To get back to our example, a Turk may identify with Otto von Bismarck but Turkey can't claim that Otto von Bismarck is part of Turkish history just because some Turks may have mixed with Germans. 

&gt;However, today, people in Macedonia are a mixture of those locals there and Slavs who migrated to the region later.

But that's beyond stupid. Even if we fully accept that there was a large scale inter ethnic mixing between Slavs and Greeks (which there weren't to the extent that would justify your hypothesis), ancient Macedon ceased to exist in 168 BC when it was conquered by the Romans. The Slavs arrived in the Balkans in the 6th-7th century AD, circa 700 years later. Where is the connection? 

&gt;It's not like Greeks feeling nostalgic about Alexander makes perfect sense

Most issues with refugees come from the fact that the assimilation does not work.

5391,"Nobody can have an exclusive claim of a fucking name. Nobody in the entire world makes such a big deal out of it except the Greeks. There are a lot of regions in the world with same names as countries expanding in the territories of other countries and nobody bats an eye. It doesn't matter. History and self-determination and identity is complex.

Also, nobody can have an exclusive claim of any part of ancient history.

Self-determination and identity is a basic human right. Our ethnic identity is based on the word ""Macedonia"" for hundreds of years, and changing even one letter deletes our identity and history. Let me make this a little bit clearer with as few words as possible. Slavs settled in the Balkans in the 6th century. Part of them settled in the Western Balkans, mixed with the native people (probably Illyrians) and with time the ethnic identities of Serbians/Croatians/Slovenians etc was formed. Part of the Slavs settled the Eastern Balkans (todays Bulgaria), mixed with Bulgars and Thracians, who got Slavicised. You surely know the original Bulgars were Turkic people, speaking some Turkic language. Even though the population at this point became all Slavic speaking, they kept the name Bulgars and the ethnic identity of the modern Bulgarians was formed. Now comes the most important part. Part of the Slavs settled in the Southern Balkans, in a big geographical region in that time known as MACEDONIA. The Slavs mixed with the native population descending from the ancient Macedonians there, inheriting part of their culture and traditions, but keeping their Slavic language. The""original"" Macedonians got Slavicised. The people living in the region of Macedonia, mostly Slavic speaking, knew that this place is called Macedonia, and after living for hundreds of years there, they started calling themselves MACEDONIANS. There are tons of historical evidence about this. The meaning of the term ""Macedonians"" got rebranded in a way. Macedonians were not longer only Greek speaking people but Slavic speaking. Same as Egyptians of today are Arabic speaking people, not Egyptian speaking (Actually it's not very clear that even in antiquity the original Macedonians had Greek as their mother tongue or they were just Hellenised). The Slavic speaking population of Macedonia regarded itself as Macedonian for a very very long time ago, it's not something new. Greece as a state didn't exist back then, actually even that ""original"" Macedon territory never belonged to Greece until they took it in 1913 after the Balkan wars. The population in that ""original"" Macedon territory was 90&amp;#37; Slavic speakers identifying as MACEDONIANS.

Greece made ethnic cleansing, I'm not gonna use the word genocide here but you get what I'm saying. This is all well documented. Villages burned, people killed or kicked out of the country, people's names changed. The refugees flee to America, Canada, and in Southern Yugoslavia (todays Republic of Macedonia). Also, with the intention of ethnic cleansing and creating pure ethnic country, Greece did population exchange with Turkey, exporting muslim Slavic Macedonians in Turkey and inporting Greeks from Turkey who settled in the Macedon territory and Greece branded them as the ""true Greek Macedonians"". There is evidence that the Slavs of Macedonia called themselves ""Macedonian"" as early as the tenth century A.D. At the same time, the Byzantine emperors came to call the Macedonian Slavs ""the Macedonians"" since they made up the politically most significant population of the area. Written evidence and surviving crests from the sixteenth century proclaim Macedonia’s distinction from other Balkan territories.

There is no need for changing one letter of our name. The words ""Republic of"" in our official constitutional name clearly make a difference between the province of Greece and the country Macedonia. There is no such thing as North Korea and South Korea, those are just nicknames, their official names are Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Republic of Korea. How there can be two Koreas and not two Macedonias?

Do Greeks actually understand that if we even change one letter of our country's name we loose our identity and history? What are we gonna do with all the hundreds of years old Slavic Macedonian folk songs containing the word ""Macedonian"" and ""Macedonians""? Change them into ""North Macedonians"". This is ridiculous.

It's degrading and humiliating. Greece - the cradle of democracy?? Please...

Imagine a guy named John calling his house The John Palace. Then John loses his house and is forced to move in another house which he also names The John Palace. Now the guy who lives in his old says says to him ""You can't name you house The John Palace because I know own the original John Palace. You have to change your houses's name and your personal name John"". This is fucking retarded.

PKS is published around late April every year, so at the time of writing the article they did not have official data confirming violent crime dropped in 2017, although multiple mid-year reports and statements from officials made that information more than available to the public and journalists. 

The [rise in violent crime](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/153880/umfrage/faelle-von-gewaltkriminalitaet/) in 2015 from 2014 was 0.2%, from 2015 to 2016 it was 6.7%, followed by 2.4% reduction in the next. The 2016 number was a record high since only 2013, every year from 2002 through 2012 had a higher figure.

5524,"&gt; That is not how law works. If you adopt it, it is enforceable. You cannot adopt hypothetical, future law.
&gt; 
&gt; Moreover, this provision is drafted in such broad terms that there is nothing to stop those who will enjoy the rights it creates to turn to the courts. And when they do, the courts will be obliged to enforce the law. If the corporation involved is big enough (and fyi courts in the past have been very generous in interpreting these vague terms), then they will have to require filtering.

But it doesn't say that we should adapt filters. It says that examples of potential monitoring systems are filters. 

&gt; That’s not true. The only thing semi-relevant to a transparency obligation can be found in Recital 38ca, but that goes in the opposite direction. It requires service providers to be transparent towards rightholders with regard to the deployed measures.

You are right. It is covered in the first paragraph and is to the rightholders. I stand corrected.


&gt; There is no fair use in Europe. The InfoSoc Directive instead introduces a limited list of possible exceptions and limitations that Member States can introduce into their national law.

What I mean about Fair Use, is the actual definition of rightholders and protected content. This is not done at all by the Directive or if it is, I didn't see where.

&gt; That’s funny, because the CJEU itself made exactly that case in the aforementioned SABAM decisions.

I meant that, without knowing what exactly is protected, it's really hard to say that X amount of things will be lost.


&gt; Sadly, it is not as straightforward as that. As I said above, courts have to apply the law and lower courts are (rightly) particularly hesitant to declare that pieces of secondary legislation are incompatible with constitutional norms. Any court case on this will have to be taken to a national supreme court or the CJEU. This could take close to a decade, even if proceedings start immediately after the entry into force of the law. In the meantime, most platforms will play it safe. Why should they stick their neck out for the sake of their users’ freedom of expression? They will err on the side of caution and their bottom line, adopt filtering and shut up about it.

Maybe you are right and it's just wishful thinking on my part. Maybe I place too much trust on our representatives that they will implement the directive in a reasonable way and not just blindly copy-paste undefined notions..

No they are not? You can go to each other's countries and you have quite good trade line. How is this a ""state of war""? There is no war there, there are only dogfights and unnecessary threats which don't mean shit in reality. 

Israel and Syria are hostile, and even they do not go for a full-blown war with each other. 

There is much to risk and it's not worth it.

&gt;  Every single day they do stuff, that if any other country did to another and were not nato allies, it would start a war.

No, even then it would not. They shot down Russian plane and war did not start. Seriously war is not something that nations consider easily. On the contrary, you try to avoid war as much as possible. Just because one shots down a plane, you do not risk the lives of millions in your country. Let alone Turkey, even N. Korea does not want war.

&gt; The only reason they don't go full attack on us is that they know we can still counter them, and they will have economical problems as you say.

War in this century would require you to be totally independent or at least have enough allies to sustain your economy. Turkey does not satisfy these conditions, and neither does Greece. Both countries are bound to live in peace otherwise the assaulter will experience an economical collapse, leading a capitulation.

&gt; What does it matter if France has it bigger. I heard size doesn't matter. Only how you use it. 

Yeah but I don't think France has an airforce that is technologically inferior to the Greek one, given the fact that French budget is enormously higher than the Greek one and can invest into sophisticated inventory. Plus, they produce their own jets (Mirage), which they sell to others (to you too, probably).

Okay, maar je kan je nog steeds verduidelijken.

Als je reageert op 'n punt wat ik maak dan neem ik aan dat je het over dat punt hebt natuurlijk.

&gt; Waarom zeg je dit i.p.v. stelling of aanname?

Waarom niet? Het is een synoniem en prima Nederlands. Dat is het woord wat in me opkwam.

&gt; ""dus""

Ook ""ergo"" is prima Nederlands. Wil je alle leenwoorden de taal uit gooien? Waarom zeg je ""reageren"" in plaats van ""antwoorden?"" Waarom zeg je ""thread "" in plaats van ""draad""?

&gt; Niet Nederlands

Oh jawel hoor maar het is misschien wat Vlaams of ouderwets. Het is gewoon een stille vorm van ""mijnen"".

&gt; Je gebruikt de absurd formele vormen ""these"" en ""ergo"" die buiten een juridisch of archaisch-academisch stuk absurd zijn, maar je kort ""een"" af naar ""'n"" wat zo informeel is, dat het al ongepast is in een e-mail naar een familielid?

Correct — ik heb het altijd al absurd gevonden dat je ""ik"", ""het"", ""hij"" en ""een"" niet to ""'k"", ""'t"", ""'ie"" en ""'n"" mag afkorten zogenaamd in geschreven taal maar wel bijvoorbeeld ""jij"" to ""je"". Uiteindelijk is dat hoe je het uitspreekt en zeg je gewoon niet volledig ""een"" of ""hij"" in der praktijk.

Ik schrijf hoe ik spreek en en de advocaten en wetenschappers die ""ergo"" en ""these"" zeggen die spreken ""een"" ook gewoon als ""'n"" uit hoor als ze dat doen.

&gt; Niet Nederlands, en ook niet te verklaren als luie vertaling zoals mijn ""antagoniseren"" waarvoor simpelweg geen makkelijke NL versie is.

Nou ja het heeft citaties als ik het opzoek; niet veel maar toch; uiteindelijk is het vermogen tot samenstellen natuurlijk ongelimiteerd. Weet jij een beter woord er voor dan?

&gt; Je probeert zogenaamd formeel te zijn

Blijkbaar niet hè wat je zelf ook aankaart? Dat is het punt hè; je zegt dat ik formeel probeer te doen maar je komt met enorm veel punten war ik dat duidelijk niet probeer en dan val je me daar aan op inconsistentie. Dat is wel een heel bizar argument; je valt me in feite aan op het feit dat er tegenbewijs bestaat tegen je oorspronkelijke aanval aan der hand van dat ik niet goed genoeg pas in het stereotype waarop je me aanvalt.

&gt; maar overduidelijk om je tekst moeilijker leesbaar te maken, vermoedelijk om intelligent over te komen. Dat past bijv. binnen het stereotype van een ""m'lady neckbeard"" zoals deze binnen reddit bekend is. Ondertussen heb je rare grammaticale fouten en zijn de punten die je probeert te maken óf genant naief, óf volslagen bullshit.

Blijkbaar niet hè, anders zou ik wel niet ""'n"" gebruiken?

&gt; Maar concreet, het innemen van standpunten, zonder beargumentatie, die tegen de algemene geaccepteerde wijsheid ingaan, terwijl je je tekst opzettelijk moeilijk leesbaar schrijft, maakt je een troll.

Ehh, ik heb prima argumenten gegeven waarom nationalisme slecht is. Kan jij mij éénen enkelen hedendaagsen autocraat noemen die het niet door nationalisme doet? Denk jij dat de Tweede Wereldoorlog plaats had kunnen vinden zonder nationalisme?

I’ve always considered a company to be a ‘possession’ of the owner; he or she should be able to do whatever he or she pleases with it, as long as you don’t hurt people. I don’t think lots of people truly feel this way; from the sound of it, it appears that people think companies have some kind of obligation to society (not only in this context, but also benefits at work and other issues that people complain about) - I fundamentally disagree with this.

The issue isn’t moral or ethical for the state - but it is for me (and probably lots of other libertarians).

This is the case in Albanian folk costumes, where the ""Gajtan"" markings encode for tribal information and this is the case with the Xhubleta as well. One could not just wear another clans dress. You are the one who is projecting the fluid view of todays codes of conduct on to the past.

This is the case with Scottish highlanders aswell, where it would be unheard of that a man from one clan wears the ""Tartar"" of a man from another clan just because he felt like it.

Please restrain yourself from inventing fictions with concern to dates and such (19th century). There are many elements of the Albanian folk dress that are certified 3000 years minimum, such as the Qelesh (Pileus), which is the same as it was since Odysseus and was depicted wearing it. Or the Opinga (Hittite boot rhyton 1900-1600 BC, Mycenean Boot Rhyton 1500BC). Or the face paint which is incuded in the album.

5636,"&gt; The directive aims to be futureproof. That's why it stipulates that anything used needs to be proportionate and appropriate while also keeping technology achievements in mind. 

Technological development is irrelevant to this question. Even if filters were fully perfected, they would still impose general monitoring obligations. ‘Futureproofing’ legislation involves drafting it in broad enough terms to cover future innovation. It does not mean adopting laws that are currently and will in the future be incompatible with fundamental rights. 

This is a question of first principles, not a technological one. The problem is not that they have a good idea, but are using excessively narrow drafting terms to implement it into law. The problem is that what they are trying to do is fundamentally wrong. 

&gt; So I doubt that they intend to enforce a filter on day 1. It's just that, the direction we are going, it's going to be enforced when it's viable.

That is not how law works. If you adopt it, it is enforceable. You cannot adopt hypothetical, future law. 

Moreover, this provision is drafted in such broad terms that there is nothing to stop those who will enjoy the rights it creates to turn to the courts. And when they do, the courts will be obliged to enforce the law. If the corporation involved is big enough (and fyi courts in the past have been very generous in interpreting these vague terms), then they will have to require filtering.  

&gt; Regarding B, I think A13 enforces a regular publication of ""removed"" content for both transparency and making sure it's working as intended. 

That’s not true. The only thing semi-relevant to a transparency obligation can be found in Recital 38ca, but that goes in the opposite direction. It requires service providers to be transparent *towards rightholders* with regard to the deployed measures. 

&gt; Further to that, Fair Use is defined separately, so it's really hard to make a case about overly removed content.

There is no fair use in Europe. The InfoSoc Directive instead introduces a limited list of possible exceptions and limitations that Member States can introduce into their national law. 

The fact that these exceptions and limitations are defined separately is also entirely irrelevant (in fact, I’m not even sure what you mean by this). If they apply, then the user is entitled to the use of the copyright-protected content. Yet filters will not know this and will take the content down. Exceptions and limitations to copyright will essentially be invalidated on the internet. 

&gt; it's really hard to make a case about overly removed content

That’s funny, because the CJEU itself made exactly that case in the aforementioned SABAM decisions. 

&gt; Interesting. I have no idea on the technical implications of filters, so I will just take your word for it. As a result, by A13 paragraph 3, it's impossible to have a filter currently and therefore cannot have one.

Sadly, it is not as straightforward as that. As I said above, courts have to apply the law and lower courts are (rightly) particularly hesitant to declare that pieces of secondary legislation are incompatible with constitutional norms. Any court case on this will have to be taken to a national supreme court or the CJEU. This could take close to a decade, even if proceedings start immediately after the entry into force of the law. In the meantime, most platforms will play it safe. Why should they stick their neck out for the sake of their users’ freedom of expression? They will err on the side of caution and their bottom line, adopt filtering and shut up about it.

I don't think you are understanding my critique. He's taking two things: the genetic link (proven) and the slight similarity of dress (proven), to prove that this specific valley has a specific unbroken cultural connection to another people (unproven).

To prove something like that, you would have to support your argument in an analysis of the costumes of the whole Alpine region, to see if it's as exclusive as he claims; ethnological studies on the origins and evolution of that dress, to see if there are no other explanations and if the dress has indeed remained similar for long; and comparisons to studies of similar cases, to see if that might be plausible.

&gt; And where does this term 'heit' come from? One of the first words a Frisian child says when he starts talking is 'heit'. Historically, this is sometimes called a 'babbling' word. A sound of babies used to point out things and which is later grown to what today's 'heit' is. The form of 'heit' seems to be a real Frisian word, because it does not exist in the other Germanic languages ​​(eg English, German, Norwegian and Dutch), in these languages ​​papa, pa or some form of fader, vader, father, Vater is used. In Old Frisian fader or feder is used. The form of 'heit' has been hardly handed over from that time. The oldest Frisian 'heit' appearance was from 1597: ""Ws haita dw derstu biste yne hymil"" (Our Father is in heaven). In this citation, God is referred to as 'heit', but the ordinary meaning of 'heit' is 'one who has one or more children.' In the quotation 'heit' has an -a at the end, which is later changed to -e. In modern Frisian, this exit has almost completely gone, but in the Frisian 'Wâlden' (forest area) there is still the form 'heite', most used in senses as: 'no giest deroan heite!' (I will get you) and 'myn brommer jaget wol 120 kilometer, heite!' (My mopad can get to 120km/h).",,/r/europe/comments/8rre3z/father_in_european_languages/e0varep/,wytsep,1529328684

Most of the time they appeal to emotions and fearmonger to prove their points, and their arguments fall flat when confronted with facts.

Their parties' stances are almost solely based on criticizing the elite and they make it seem like it's a piece of cake to run a country and like only someone with a hidden agenda could mess stuff up. This works really well with the voters, as populist parties never got to govern so they cannot be blamed that they didn't do anything in their terms either, like mainstream oppositions are blamed.

Now, over the next few years, we will see how the first populist government* in Europe (Italy's) will manage to fulfil the promises they made and to make people's life better. I am very skeptical of it and I am convinced they will either outright fail or succeed by pursuing the same policies followed by the mainstream politicians that they despise so much.

Both opponents and proponents of totalitarian governments recognized that a seemingly secure government could break down in days, as the Soviets witnessed firsthand in Hungary when ambassador Yuri Andropov (later General Secretary of the USSR) watched from the embassy as Hungarians lynched officers of the internal security services in the streets.

An authoritarian government is inherently going to weaken over time because its suppression of freedoms results in there being little way to gauge its actual level of approval or make reforms to address discontent. A democracy (or at least a government with some degree of free press and feedback) can identify when it lacks support and adjust policy to avoid going down a path that ends in rebellion.

If we want to look at if the refugee crisis had an effect, it makes more sense to directly access the data of Germany or even the different German states.

Also, as some crimes take some time to get reported or noticed and not everything that get's reported as a crime is actually one, i wonder if there is a delay by design to get more or less correct data.

5776,"Nah. Do not be generous in your assessment. These guys, at least  the  companies  pushing this, know EXACTLY what they want from this. They are not ignorant, their intent is to wreck the internet as you know it in order to create an industry that can make money off sanitizing information before it reaches the internet. Pretty much they want money to be editors, or go back to how things used to be when informational exchanges were very limited and expensive. (Newspapers, Radio and TV can only exchange so much information. What you really paid papers for was their editorial work to limit information only to what was needed to draw eyeballs to ads.) 

They want that world again. Their INTENT is to destroy the internet. They don't want people to research specific topics and find stories on it. They want people to have to research their paper/website in order to find what stories are ""need to know"" for the day. Ergo, exactly how things used to work before we took a step toward becoming a post-information-scarcity society. Instead going to Facebook/Twitter/Reddit/Google and seeing a bunch of papers competing to inform you, like an information marketplace where they are a single shop. They want to you to go to their website and for them to be the marketplace--and all the items on sale? Are all made by them. 

That's how it used to be. This is supported by the government because it creates a great, exploitable relationship for people to get rich over and for the few to control information. And its done without the need criminal punitive measures (Which can look tyrannical!), it will be done through 'civil punishments' from private parties. But the effect will be the same (Limiting information sharing). Those civil punishments will make it so information will be ""too expensive"" to simply toss around. So once more the editorial work of news papers will be in demand, deciding what readers get to look at for the same reasoning as in times past, because there will only be a limited amount of space for it, because only a few *trustworthy* news media giants (Wink wink, nudge nudge) will have relationships with various media trademark and copyright watchdogs to ensure they aren't sued to oblivion. 

So only these media giants will be able to handle publishing information--you want your information out there, it needs to be approved by their editorial process. This is very different from the ""hosting"" model a lot of the information exchanges online currently adhere to--hosting has very very limited editorial control (In theory, but growing censorship in these spaces is another discussion). However, this limitation is artificial, rather than practical (Like the physical limitation of bandwidth on radio/TV or the limitation on space/logistics in news papers) and thus the government is needed by the papers to create it--so the papers are indebted to the governments. The governments now have a few specific nexuses online where information gets printed, who are in their debt and partly under their thumb--which works well to limit ""bad information"" (Or any information which is damaging). 

Everyone wins except you. This is not a blunder being done by ignorant people. This is a calculated move being done by people looking to resurrect an industry for the dual purpose of having better control over information, and being able to make more money of said control.",,/r/europe/comments/8rxmgq/the_eus_carpet_bomb_copyright_law_heads_to/e0v5h2u/,Michael_Riendeau,1529321199

As the data show, the number of non-Czechs grew by approximately 31,000 from 2016 to 2017, making the total number of international residents in CR around 524,000 (both with permanent residence and long-term residence over 90 days, as shown in the graph below). With the population of the country of 10.610.055 citizens, other nationalities make up around 5% of the population.

&gt; Breaking the number along the national lines, expectedly, the largest number of people comes from Slovakia (64,285 or around 12% of foreigners), followed by Ukrainians (33,682 or 6,4%), and then Germany (16,802 or 3,2%) and Russian Federation (15,474 or 3%).

The number is roughly 150,000 in **Hungary** and 50,000 in **Slovakia** (according to statistics I was able to found).

I admit, I don't know what this exactly means, but that's cause the sentence is incorrect. But *pushing* transgenderism is in a way *forcing* it upon people. That's what pushing means.

And they don't do that in ""places like Canada"".

5977,"&gt; But that's not the same at all. Belgians, Dutch and Germans are of Germanic descent (well except Walloons) and all 3 speak in a germanic language.

Benelux region has been contested region between major powers for centuries. Germany and France kept invading the region, and France is not a Germanic nation. Calling them ""Germanic"" may not only offend them, may also be not true, given the fact that they speak French for the most part and they have slightly different genetic features, which shows that they are indeed a mixture.

&gt; Balkans isn't as homogenous as you claim it is. Greeks have nothing to do with Slavs, same with Albanians. North Macedonians are Slavs, you can't say they are the same when their ethnicity and language are completely different.

You are confusing genetics with culture? I never said Slavs have the same culture with Greeks. I said Balkan folks have been mixing with each other as the entire region has been a clusterfuck for centuries. Invasions, occupations, atrocities, you name it. In a region which is so fucked up, you cannot have a pure race. You can seek purity in Iceland or Amazons, but not in Balkans or Benelux.

&gt; How? Alexander died in 323. BC. Slave came to the Balkans in the 6th and 7th century AD. How can you honestly say that North Macedonians descend from ancient Macedonians when ancient Macedon stopped existing for hundreds of years by the time the Slavs came.

Because Slavs came and mixed with the local populace over there. Local Greeks did not evaporate when Alexander died. Just like in Mexico, Aztecs did not evaporate, rather mixed with the Spaniards. That's why in Mexico you can see people with both phenotypes.

&gt; The ancient Macedonians were NOT Slavs, they spoke Greek, they identified as Greeks, they had the same traditions as Greeks in the south and worshipped the same Gods. 

Yes, I don't dispute this at all?

&gt; Sure they can feel whatever they want but feelings are one thing and historical facts are another. There is more than enough evidence to claim that ancient Macedonians were Greek and not some separate ethnic group.

Ancient Macedonians were Greek, no doubt about that. However, today, people in Macedonia are a mixture of those locals there and Slavs who migrated to the region later. So, they have a right to feel nostalgic about their ancient past, even if they embraced another culture later. I gave examples of this in my previous post. Egypt, Tunisia, Mexico etc.

&gt; Sardes was actually not an ancient Greek city.

Well originally not, you're right. Lydians founded it, Persians ruled it and Greeks took it. You can find traces of these three factions there. But this kind of cycle is quite common in that region. Anatolia had hosted a ping-pong match between Ancient Greece and Persia. 

&gt; Okay, so we do agree that their identity is based purely on feelings and bullshit and not on historical facts. Glad we agree on something!

Every feeling of such is bullshit. I didn't even think there is a logical sense in such quarrels. It's not like Greeks feeling nostalgic about Alexander makes perfect sense, or Germans about Frederick. The whole notion of nationalism is pointless.

5982,"Well, my humble opinion is that material safety is not all, unless it is the reason behind the way adults interact with children. As a foreigner living in The Netherlands for a while, there is something I learned there, about how they treat their children. Children in The Netherlands are encouraged to be what they want, and more important, they are taught from very early age that they are awesome and capable to do things. That is a huge difference with the culture of obedience, constant need for external validation, that children are taught in many other countries. I remember that the words I heard from my father most when I was a child were ""you are useful for nothing"". Everytime he got mad for anything, I'm sure he was trying to ""tame"" me somehow for his own purposes. This creates unhappy people that lack confidence. Dutchies however are overflowing with this confidence. And this is not a personal observation only, I have talked to other people that know Dutch and had the same impression about children's education there and how it benefits the person development later.

5993,"&gt; The Federal Republic (FRG) never recognised the German Democratic Republic in its 40 years of existence. This is why GDR citizens were able to settle in the FRG very easily, since they were recognised as FRG citizens.

While it's true that GDR citizens were automatically FRG citizens, the Moscow Treaty of 1970 and the Basic Treaty of 1972 still de facto accepted the GDR as a state and the Federal Constitutional Court acknowledged its status as an international subject. The FRG also dropped its insistence of being the only legitimate German state around the same time.

&gt; No, this is a fabrication. These territories have been accepted as a part of Poland since 1945. The Adenauer government never made an attempt to 'reclaim' this area back. 

The FRG didn't fully acknowledge the Oder-Neiße-Border until 1990 and the earliest instance of factually accepting it on a government level was under Willy Brandt with the 1970 Warsaw Treaty (no, not that one). In fact, I still have old atlasses from the 50s and 60s at home, which still show Prussia and Silesia as polish-occupied.
