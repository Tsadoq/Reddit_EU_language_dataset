Erdogan fucked up big times in international relations, no argument when it comes to there. I mean Turkey-Israel has been the best buddies and historic partners since establishment. He managed to fuck that up, while also gaining hatred from Arabs. I don't even know how you can do that on purpose.

Only a fool (such as Trump) in a position of power can neglect or ignore a country like that. Not even mentioning 17th largest economy in the world (at least for now, maybe it will go worse with this economy)

If capable hands were ruling Turkey, even in current situation, Turkey can salvage NATO to do as it is pleased. Which I am expecting the end result of this S-400 situation.

[Almost](https://www.ft.com/content/d6785134-3f2a-11e8-b7e0-52972418fec4). This is the direct trade impact of the sanctions. Estimations as to the indirect effects of them are along the lines of ~‚Ç¨700m/month, which means to say that in total, the sanctions shaved off between ‚Ç¨50bn and ‚Ç¨60bn of Germany's GDP within a five year period (sanctions are in force since February 2014). 

Just to put things in perspective here: This is about the same impact as a no-deal Brexit scenario would have for the German economy over the period of a decade:

&gt; Depending on the extent of Britain‚Äôs trade isolation, Germany's real GDP per inhabitant in 2030 would be only between 0.1% and 0.2% lower than if the UK had remained in the EU.

174,"&gt; My issue with free movement of people is no against the idea in general, but that there's remarkably little concern for what negative effects it might have.

That's a matter of national policy though - at the national level there is similar apathy to immigration consequences, and the negative effects of internal migration are even less in the picture - and nobody would argue to limit internal migration to deal with that.

&gt;Poland and Romania and some other countries are losing their young people, (or were, at least) at massive rates. Workers were being exploited in countries like the UK to force down local wages and disrupt unions and worker organisation in some cases.

And at the same time wages in Poland and Romania go up. Wage convergence is the inevitable and desireable result of free movement and the single market, and that will naturally solve those problems. The only thing we need to ensure is that it's going to be an upward convergence.

&gt;Also local services that are already suffering under the impact of the financial crises were not being maintained, increasing local xenophobia and nationalism. This is a big part of what led to brexit.

That's national policy.

&gt; It seems reasonable that a country can still agree to the principle of free movement but also require a time limited break to the rule. For example a mechanism where the UK could have said, we would like a three year cut on freedom of movement, would be reasonable i think, as long as this was only permitted ifit was conditional on increased spending on infrastructure and stabilizing worker rights.

It actually was possible for the UK to implement reduced immigration from those countries immediately after joining, to avoid disruptive migration. Other EU countries like Germany and France did, but the UK didn't deem it necessary.

&gt;The other problem with the freedom of movement of capital is it can create nasty bubbles. 

What makes you think capital can't move freely without the EU? That's why freedom of movement of labor is so important: it puts people on equal footing with capital, at least in the EU. Now there's an alternative over begging for capital to come to you.

&gt;The property market in Lisbon has been hugely inflated by vast amounts of speculation from French, British and German property investors. 
&gt;Lisbon has been hugely inflated by vast amounts of speculation from French, British and German property investors. People are being forced out of the city, old people being made homeless and the cities character is being destroyed. 

The same goes for London, but did the UK ever propose to cut off the inflow of international capital to combat that? That's what it's like living in a rich country.

&gt;Money from other EU countries is flooding in and the local government is not of sufficient quality to do much except become more corrupt as a resullt. There needs to be either ways of controlling this or compensating for it.

[citation needed]

&gt;I think the EU principles are sound. But regardless of what organisation, we should not centralize markets more than we can retrain workforces to deal with the consequences. A systems tendency to centralize should never outweigh its ability to act with humane specificity.

This is a broad principle so obviously easy to agree, but as you see above the assessment of the particularities on the ground is what differs.

184,"&gt; My argument is that there is a lot more minor crimes happening than major crimes. And in those small crimes being able to communicate, understand and empathize with the people involved is extremely important. So if we're just talking by genetics women, will be more predisposed to those characteristics. In the ""big crimes"", in any situations that require physical capabilities by genetics, men will be a lot more predisposed for it. (although in some cases it is still possible to defuse a situation before it gets into a situation requiring physical capabilities)

No, that's plain sexist.

Either way, I offer the same solution: describe whatever you think the ideal police officer is, and we'll test people on those characteristics. The people who best fit those criteria get the job.

&gt;So taking those two into consideration I think it's important to keep the tests different, to make sure there's some balance (not 50/50, but not 95/5). To make sure that police officers are versatile and use the best of both worlds.

If you think it's useful to have specialized police forces, then you write out two profiles and you hold two selections. Those who perform best get the job, period.

&gt;And maybe you are right with holding to the same standards, in a perfect world where we paid the officers more, thus had a bigger supply of them, it would be right to demand a high standard both physically and mentally, but in the current world, I think we would be wasting a lot of useful and needed officers by increasing the physical requirement for women.

If you think there's a shortage of candidate police officers (first time I hear about that), and the physical criteria are the bottleneck, then you reduce physical criteria for everyone.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/ayzkgv/female_vs_male_managers_in_the_eu/ei6c2ns/,silverionmox,1552177849

Yes repair work will be done remotely and that is expensive, but this is factored into the cost projections already, and it is projected to be cheaper than coal even with remote repair work.

235,"&gt;This is what I'm talking about, a need to  justify the invasion to yourself, and brag about how good you lot are,  instead of any actual plan or strategy. This is a military operation. If  Khabul falls and all those now free men and women run scrambling to  helicopters to escape, what use was it? I also recall confirmed Civilian  deaths being around 31,000.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;They  have 14,000 troops and despite promises to exit Afghanistan, former  Defense Secretary Mattis sent orders for more troops in March 2018, one  year ago (despite earlier campaign promises). Now he's gone and they've  been ordered to go back out again. It's a schizophrenic policy.

&amp;#x200B;

And? That's not many troops for us. Also, your number are old, there are less than 10,000 US troops there now. The US is over 5 times the population of France and we have much larger military budgets. That's not many troops for us at all. We can do this forever. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's nothing schizophrenic about building schools and hospitals. We can do this forever. If we get a peace deal that brings the Taliban into the political system and make them accept democracy, then we won't even need to keep any troops. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yes Pashtuns have around 40% of the country, Tajik's have another 26% and it's composed of different groups, and the Taliban. Honestly, that you put the possibility of civil war as a positive bonus is bewildering.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I put the possibility of civil war at so low because the vast majority of Pashtuns don't support the Taliban. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If we ignore instances where 43 million  dollars on a gas station, it still doesn't change the military balance.  One can't just pump in money and say ""Look, they must love us because we  spent so much money"". The Russians were also bled dry by a foreign  sponsored guerilla war, and did build roads.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's  interesting to mention history, because they fought a bloody war that  lasted nine years, withdrew under Gorbachev, left their installed  government under Karmal in 1989, which collapsed in 1992.

&amp;#x200B;

What's your point? The government propped by Gorbachev was despised by the people. The US doesn't control the government of Afghanistan, it's a sovereign country with an elected government. We didn't even have good relations with the last president Karzai. There's not similarity, I was contrasting the Russian war with the US war, that's the point. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Or because the US doesn't have the  political capital to commit more troops. Because once again, I would  like you to acknowledge that the Taliban is gaining ground.  
&gt;  
&gt;A  nation which has won as you describe doesn't lose control of almost  half the territory of the country they occupy, or have to negotiate an  exit where they ask their opponents to promise to not attack their  installed government.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Political capital to who? To the US voters? We barely have any troops there and almost none are dying right now. We can do this forever because it doesn't cost us much money. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Why do you even care? Nobody is making France put troops in Afghanistan. The US isn't going to collapse from having a few thousand troops in Afghanistan. We can do this all day son. ",,/r/europe/comments/ax5hwm/economic_war_how_american_justice_targets_foreign/ei618xp/,sandyhands2,1552168627

245,"&gt; The only way to do that practically is with automatic content filters.

Sure, but not filters akin to ContentID. These filters are simple, accessible, comprehensible and transparent. They don't have false positives, since they don't have to make any creative decisions. Either something is a reupload, either something is not. 

&gt; That's exactly what is burdensome. Now you have to deal with every asshole company sending you their work and somehow figure out how to prevent people from uploading it and you can't just tell them to piss off, even if their work hasn't been uploaded to your platform yet. 

It's a balance of rights. Right now only big rightholders get to enforce their rights as only they have the resources to scan the entirety of for instance YouTube for duplicates. Furthermore, if you have a business model that requires you to profit from vast amounts of user submitted content, you should accept this absolute minimal effort to make sure nothing illegal is published. 

&gt; Presumably if they emailed you their work and then uploaded content to your platform you would now be liable even if you never received notification that the work was on your platform. 


If you think this is an issue, there are more problems than this law. According to the GDPR users have the right to delete their data. This can also be interpreted as ""if a user sends an email saying so, the platform has to delete their data"". The Directive 2000/31/EC can also be interpreted as ""if rightholders send an email notifying about illegal content, platforms must take them offline"". Yet again, in practise this burden doesn't exist.

Let's also not forget in general the burden will be smaller. Right now, under your interpretation, platforms have to process individual emails for every occurrence of a violation. Under Article 13, there would be only one ""email"".

But let's face it, any sizeable platform is going to streamline the process, just like they did with 200/31/EC and just like they did with the GDPR. 

&gt; Oh, douche-sucking rights-management companies are really going to enjoy milking this new method of shanking people with frivolous lawsuits and extorting settlements.

Article 13 doesn't apply to people, only to platforms making profit primarily of vast amounts of copyrighted content. 

&gt; Because that's exactly what it does per your own explanation.

Which is again a gross misinterpretation of what the directive does. Sure, a system to basically detect duplicate content. By no means does the directive force Twitter to enable ContentID on their videos. 

&gt; I haven't seen any good evidence that is the case or even what constitutes a small business. A lot of very popular websites could be considered small businesses.

It's a directive. Ultimately, member states will get to decide. We know that websites need to either make over 10 million euros annually, or have existed for over three years. Platforms' business model must primarily exist out of allowing independent users to supply the platform with copyrighted material, which the platform organises and makes available for profit. This excludes most of the internet already. 

On top of that there is a inventory-size requirement. Article 13 only applies to OCSSP which have a _large_ amount of copyrighted materials.

Indeed there are a lot of blanks to be filled in. Do not forget though, that the directive (or any directive) does not apply to companies or people. Directives are rules for member states. Member states will have to write laws based on the directive. This way member states get to fill in the blanks based on their own needs. A regulation would be more specific and be immediately binding (direct force) to people, however the EU is only allowed to use those when they can demonstrate a clear reason why a directive would've been insufficient. 

&gt; The only people sitting around that table are giant digital rights monopolies like Disney and tech monopolies like Google and they are doing their best to enshrine their monopolies in law.

Article 13 requires all people to be invited to the table and fill in what types of practises are acceptable. For the first time users themselves will be invited around the table.

251,"&gt;Going after every litterer is a noble pursuit. But building plastic recycling/disposal plants where there are none is far more effective.

Far more effective than going after every litterer? Yes, but this ban isn't about going after every litterer, so it is irrelevant to compare recycling and disposal to going after every litterer. It has no relevance to this ban.

This ban is about banning *production and sale*. Not going after every litterer. Also the plastic strategy in a wider scale is about advancing plastic recycling and disposal. The plastic strategy is precisely about what you say it should be. It also pushesh for the kind of bottle refund schemes many countries also have. I suppose in Norway also you pay a small amount for bottles and cans themselves and you get that amount refunded when you return them?

And worth notin gthat buildin plasti recycling/disposal does not affect what happens to the plastic which ends up into the oceans. It's great to have plastic recycling and disposal plants, but how will the plastic trash in the oceans get there? The problem whith marine plastic litter is something which is more effective to deal with banning most common marine litter. Because having plastic recycling/disposal plants doesn't affect the amount of litter ending up in the oceans.

-First of all: It is no bank analysis. The analysis is by the town hall (see [here](https://diario.madrid.es/blog/notas-de-prensa/20-millones-de-transacciones-comerciales-confirman-el-aumento-del-gasto-en-navidad-tras-la-implantacion-de-madrid-central/) the key being ""Estos datos se recogen en un estudio realizado por el Ayuntamiento de Madrid con datos del BBVA"". By the way, the forbes blogger's link (really? are we still taking the forbes blogs as a legitimate source?) takes you to the pdf at the end of that website. As you can see, the pdf has the Town Hall's logo, not the banks. The bank presents no analysis whatsoever; [the bank denies any involvement in the study](https://twitter.com/BBVAData/status/1087976999837155328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1087976999837155328&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fokdiario.com%2Fespana%2Fmadrid%2Fbbva-desmiente-que-sea-suyo-informe-sobre-madrid-central-del-que-presume-carmena-3620800) This brings me to:

-Second: The bank's raw data was used; it basically measures the transaction of this bank's credit card terminals. Another plausible explanation could be that people now prefer to shop with credit card in Gran V√≠a and now are using cash less. There is no historic comparison for other years, so we don't even know how this increase compares other years (I suspect there's a reason for that). The town hall has vested interest in portraying the _Madrid Central_ as a great success, even for the businesses.

-Third: [There is another perspective](https://www.20minutos.es/noticia/3537032/0/volumen-negocio-comercios-centro-con-madrid-central-cayo-14-8-navidad-segun-plataforma-afectados/) the one held by small and medium business owners, who consider that their sales have dropped 15%, taking them to them back to the sales numbers during the worst time of the crisis, in 2010.

So if we accept that no one is lying to us; that BBVA credit card transactions have grown 9,5% and the small and medium business owners have seen a 15% drop, then big businesses are taking over the sales, and possibly these sales are probably seing an increase in credit card use over other payment methods.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/az4za5/closing_central_madrid_to_cars_resulted_in_95/ei61t76/,reaqtion,1552169089

Can any German care to explain? Wikipedia is telling me that this group adhere to the Weimar constitution of 1919 and the borders of that German state. However, Newsweek is telling me that it goes even earlier to 1871.

I think they might have a point IMO. I'm just reading that the ""basic law"" of 1949 had to be approved by the allied powers. So the modern German state is effectively derived from the UK, USA, France and the USSR (deceased), in that context how can it be a free and independent state?

Just because there is trash in Asia, doesn't mean it is ok for me to litter in the Baltic Sea. It's a ridiculous idea.

&gt;But is investing a great amount of political time and effort into banning single use plastics in all its forms worth it?

It's not about banning single use plastics in all forms. It's about banning certain single use plastics as a part of a more comprehensive Plastic Strategy for the EU wich in general addresses production, use, and end-management of plastic products.

&gt;You'd need massive surveys and control institutions to figure out which single use plastics we could easily eliminate and which would unacceptable damage the economy, and more importantly tax revenue.

No, you wouldn't. EU already researched and decided them. The plastics to be banned are plastic cotton buds, cutlery, plates, straws, drink stirrers and sticks for balloons.

I never really managed to explain to anyone why I moved to Russia, other than 'the relations between Russia and the Netherlands/West are so bad right now, so I'd like to see for myself how it is to live in Russia'. That was in 2015, at the end of that year I went on exchange for half a year. Met my current girlfriend then, went back home to finish bachelor, worked for a year to save money, then in 2017 moved to study a master in Saint Petersburg. I will finish it this year.

I had some interest in Russia and the Soviet Union for quite a while, not as a supporter, but as seeing it as 'the other' compared to where I come from. I just thought it would be good to 'experience' the country for a longer period, and because I was still young and had money (meaning I could afford to move), I just did.

Admittedly I very much stayed in the western part of Russia, so I won't claim to know the whole country. But I feel like I've gotten a pretty decent grasps of how average city life is and how politics and tv work.

&amp;#x200B;

I keep my Dutch flair because I identify myself as Dutch and European, and because I consciously don't plan on integrating into Russian society (I never meant to permanently move, and chances are high that I'll move to Belgium this year anyway). Not as a snub to Russia, but simply because I don't feel the least bit Russian.

&amp;#x200B;

I became very critical of Russia since moving here, much more than I was back home. But it should be noted that most of my critique flows from the standpoint the Russian government takes: 'We are a great country and the world should listen to us'. There are too many things wrong about Russia to take such a statement seriously in my eyes. And it doesn't matter that Russia is not so rich as the West  ‚Äî interesting discussion, is Russia rich or poor? For example, my alma mater Utrecht University's budget is 8x higher than Saint Petersburg State University budget ‚Äî  or that Russia has problems they are not effective at solving. It's especially the attitude of the Russian government which irks me. There is no moral judgement from me on Russia's development, except that I don't like the pretending that it's all good.

&amp;#x200B;

But most of all it's probably the administrative side. There are sooooo many things which are in theory so easy to solve or make more efficient, that even I, someone with no experience in management, could improve it. This is about my university, or street management, or parking, or isolation of buildings, or new residential areas which are connected to a highway by one single road (which also creates an intersection at said highway, creating traffic jams). But it always boils down to corruption holding everything in a deadlock, and the federal government's unwillingness to seriously do anything about corruption (actually I believe they promote corruption to a certain extent).",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/az42ny/saint_petersburg_russia/ei5s7zz/,Belcrumov,1552161427

351,"Leftists alliance with islam is easy to understand, even when you consider that muslims are often far worse than 'their' own conservatives.

It is because they have come to hate their native conservatives, not the ideas that drive them, and since their conservatives sees islam as a rival the Left therefore gladly takes their side and uses them as a tool to undermine their conservatives. The left is, of course, not wrong in their observation that european conservatives sees Islam and massive ethnic influx as a threat.

Of course they merely exchange ther status quo with something worse and become hypocrites in the process.

&gt;15) Leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being strong, good and successful. They hate America, they hate Western civilization, they hate white males, they hate rationality. The reasons that leftists give for hating the West, etc. clearly do not correspond with their real motives. They SAY they hate the West because it is warlike, imperialistic, sexist, ethnocentric and so forth, but where these same faults appear in socialist countries or in primitive cultures, the leftist finds excuses for them, or at best he GRUDGINGLY admits that they exist; whereas he ENTHUSIASTICALLY points out (and often greatly exaggerates) these faults where they appear in Western civilization. Thus it is clear that these faults are not the leftist‚Äôs real motive for hating America and the West. He hates America and the West because they are strong and successful.

[From Unabomber Manifesto](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm)

And:

&gt;In the year 2000, Swedish feminist Joanna Rytel and the action group Unf**ked Pussy entered the stage during the live broadcast of the Miss Sweden contest. She also wrote an article called ‚ÄúI Will Never Give Birth to a White Man,‚Äù for a major Swedish daily, Aftonbladet, in 2004. Rytel explained why she hates white men ‚Äî they are selfish, exploitative, vain, and sex-crazed ‚Äî and just to make things clear, she added, ‚Äúno white men, please‚Ä¶ I just puke on them, thank you very much.‚Äù

&gt;Misandry, the hatred of men, isn‚Äôt necessarily less prevalent than misogyny, the hatred of women. The difference is that the former is much more socially acceptable.

&gt;If all oppression comes from Western men, it becomes logical to try weakening them as much as possible. If you do, a paradise of peace and equality awaits us at the other side of the rainbow. Well congratulations to Western European women. You‚Äôve succeeded in harassing and ridiculing your own sons into suppressing many of their masculine instincts. To your surprise, you didn‚Äôt enter a feminist Nirvana, but paved the way for an unfolding Islamic hell.

One must also understand why leftists try to censor statistics and what they show on certain racial groups being overrepresented. 

They are shit scared of the whole illusion of multiculturalism collapsing and voters finally seeing how the Left has abandoned the native europeans in favor of immigrant groups, it's a gamble on the demographic shift happening fast enough so that europeans won't be able to stop it, ensuring that various leftist politicians stay in power by the votes of immigrants voting for the people that opened the floodgates, of course continuing the exchange of people in their favor.

That's how a labour MP can support the muslims in this aformentioned case against homosexuals, they are a far more important voting group. The MP, the Labour MP, would never in a million years have even thought about supporting a group of white christians against LGBT interests:

&gt;Labour threw open Britain's borders to mass immigration to help socially engineer a ""truly multicultural"" country, a former Government adviser has revealed.

&gt;The huge increases in migrants over the last decade were partly due to a politically motivated attempt by ministers to radically change the country and ""rub the Right's nose in diversity"", according to Andrew Neather, a former adviser to Tony Blair, Jack Straw and David Blunkett.

&gt;He said Labour's relaxation of controls was a deliberate plan to ""open up the UK to mass migration"" but that ministers were nervous and reluctant to discuss such a move publicly for fear it would alienate its ""core working class vote"".

&gt;As a result, the public argument for immigration concentrated instead on the economic benefits and need for more migrants.

&gt;Critics said the revelations showed a ""conspiracy"" within Government to impose mass immigration for ""cynical"" political reasons.

On page 29 you will see that while immigration rose since 2007 (lowpoint at ~700k) an eventually spiked in 2015 at actually ~2.2m, that emigration also rose in the same timespan, not at the same rate but still from ~650k (2007) to eventually ~1m in 2015, so your net there has been not an influx is ~2.2m but of ~1.2m (page 30 has more accurate numbers, net plus in 2015 was +1.139.403 which includes some 4.000 returning Germans). Yes, Syria was the biggest source of immigrants with 15.3% of immigrants coming from there but it was then followed by Romania (10.0%) and Poland (9.2%), although it has to be noted that Syria is together with Iraq an outlier in having next to no emigration back (not surprisingly), while emigration generally seems to account for 50-75% of the immigration number from any given country (213k Romanians came, 127k left and so on).

Taking *all* immigration to Germany in 2015 widely distorts what was happening, it not only ignores emigration happening at the same time but also that there long before the refugee crisis Germmany experienced immigration levels around 700-900k per year and that there for example was a spike to ~1.5m in 1991.

When looking for migration around the refugee crisis **you are better advised at looking at asylum requests, of which there were 890,000 in 2015** (see page 89, earlier numbers were higher because they were based on the EASY System which is used to distribute Asylum seekers between the States but puts little emphasis on removing double entries etc).",Germany,/r/europe/comments/az3r14/reporter_reveals_how_germany_ignored_warnings_of/ei5th24/,Bekoni,1552162407

Maize is looking bad, but the three other types of crop considered all have increased yield.

Table 8 is the same for rainfed yields. And is also not looking as bad as the abstract suggests.

524,"&gt; So you really believe that a filter that only blocks bit-perfect reuploads is sufficient?

I could throw that back at you. Do you really believe after 7 years of rigorous study they came to the conclusion that computers are able to detect derivative works? 

&gt; Bit-wise comparison can be defeated trivially (even think about slightly different compression artifacts in jpge), so that I cannot imagine that this will be enough to not be liable.

Recital 38b literally says that for some types of content the filters can be beaten trivially and thus it is reasonable to have to rely on rightholder notifications alone.

&gt; ""Same content"" isn't even defined. I guess everyone would call two images ""same content"" if I just slightly changed the color of a single pixel.

We can reliably detect changes like these.

&gt; Regarding your comparison for murder: I don't see any punishment for a platform when it is filtering too much. In the worst case, they will upload it later after the repeal. So they will of course tend to overblock.

There are no punishments in the directive period. Why will they overblock? Overblocking is prohibited while underblocking is not. Going from the text they will ""of course"" tend to underblock.

____________________________________________

It seems the main point of our difference of opinion is our faith in the national legislative/judicative.

I feel like this directive will cause laws that will scare away small sites, cripple medium-sized ones and will thus strengthen the big tech giants, driving monopolization on the net to a new high. At the same moment, these sites may over censor uploads (especially because they have to align with multiple different national copyright laws) and region block lots of content.

The chance of every member state adopting fair, well designed and compatible laws based on this extremely vague directive (which from my perspective at the same time ignores other important factors of the copyrighted material usage on the web) seems just so small in my opinion. Particularly as we all know how competent politicians are in regard to the internet and 'new' technology.  

What the EU really would need to do is revolutionize the way they approach laws about the internet. There would be some real single *law* that would be binding for every member state (or at least give them the possibility to join some sort of internet alliance). Every state having its own law just splits up the net and makes websites impossible to handle without extreme financial power. The internet is a 'new thing' which can't be regulated by outdated, local legal structure; at least not if you want to keep it in its current form.

______________________

So yeah, I'm against this directive not because I don't want artists and companies to get compensated for their works, but because I fear that it will speed up the commercialization, censoring, and monopolization of the free web, which plays a major role in our current concept of entertainment, social life, culture consume and education.

ETIAS ‚Äì European Travel Information and Authorisation System

In this article

ÔøºThere are many countries who are not in the European Union (EU) whose citizens can enter the EU Schengen Zone without needing a visa. Specifically, there are¬†currently 61 countries who are not in the EU, but are visa free.
Citizens of these countries are allowed to go into countries in the Schengen Zone for business or travel purposes for up to 90 days. During these 90 days, these visitors are not allowed to work or study, but can engage in business and tourism activities.
In addition, recent security concerns with terrorism and the migrant crisis have called for a better management of who is entering EU borders. The EU has continuously declared its goal of making travelling within its borders a more secure experience.
To reduce procedures and wait times, as well as address the security concerns, the European Commission (EC) has come up with a solution ‚Äì ETIAS.
This article will contain all the information you need regarding this new system and whether you qualify for it.

What is ETIAS?

ETIAS¬†stands for¬†European Travel Information and Authorization System. It is a completely electronic system which allows and keeps track of visitors from countries who do not need a visa to enter the Schengen Zone. In a way, it resembles the U.S Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), which serves a similar purpose. The legal procedures to pass the ETIAS have started in 2016, and the system is expected to be in place by 2021.
The ETIAS will undergo a detailed security check of each applicant to determine whether they can be allowed to enter any Schengen Zone country. Since citizens of countries who do not need a visa for travel purposes of up to 90 days in the EU do not need to go through a long process of applying for the visa, the ETIAS will make sure that these people are not a security threat. This travel authorization system will gather, keep track of, and update necessary information regarding visitors to determine whether it is safe for them to enter Schengen countries.
The ETIAS, besides being used for business and tourist purposes, will also allow people to visit the Schengen countries for medical and transit reasons. In addition, it will be mandatory for all countries who are Schengen visa-free.

Why ETIAS Authorization?

Ôøº
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, State of the Union Address, 14 September 2016.

In his 2016 State of the Union Address, President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker has said the following:

We need to know who is crossing our borders. This way we will know who is travelling to Europe before they even get here.

The main reason for the approval of the ETIAS authorization is security. With the increased risk of travelers worldwide, the EU wants to ensure safe travels in its countries. The ETIAS will decrease security concerns substantially through its information and data gathering systems. What this means, is that the ETIAS will detect if a person is a threat in any way to the security of Schengen countries. This will lead to the person being denied entry and avoiding the threat from being present inside EU borders. It will basically deal with a problem before it is even there.
However, besides making travelling more secure, the ETIAS authorization will also assist the EU countries and all travelers in the following ways:

Reduce procedures and application times

Improve the management of EU country borders

Assist in detecting and decreasing crime and terrorism

Impede irregular migration

Reinforce the visa liberalization policy of the EU

All in all, the ETIAS authorization will make travelling to the EU less of a hassle and a much safer experience.
THE TRAVEL AUTHORISATION SYSTEM WILL:

584,"[What you stated was wrong.](https://pressroom.rferl.org/frequently-asked-questions)

**Q. How is RFE/RL funded and managed?**

A. RFE/RL is funded by the U.S. Congress through the United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM). USAGM is independent federal government agency that oversees all U.S. civilian international media. In addition to RFE/RL, this includes Voice of America, Radio and TV Marti, Radio Free Asia, Alhurra, and Radio Sawa. In addition to providing oversight, USAGM works with RFE/RL to ensure the professional independence and integrity of its journalists.


Under IRS rules, RFE/RL is a private, nonprofit Sec. 501(c)3 corporation. Chartered in Delaware, it receives federal grants as a private grantee. RFE/RL maintains a corporate office in Washington, D.C. RFE/RL is managed by Acting President Daisy Sindelar.


**Q. If the U.S. government funds RFE/RL, how can it be independent and unbiased?**

A.‚Äã An essential guarantee of the journalistic credibility of RFE/RL is the ‚Äúfirewall‚Äù enshrined in the enabling legislation of the the United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the U.S. International Broadcasting Act.


The firewall prohibits interference by U.S. government officials, including USAGM‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer, in the objective, independent reporting of news by RFE/RL, thereby safeguarding the ability of its journalists to develop content that reflects the highest professional standards of journalism. The firewall is critical to ensure that USAGM journalists and editors can make the final decisions on what stories to cover, and how they are covered. The results of this policy are clear -- our audiences trust us.",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/az1dsx/latest_poll_results_say_trust_in_putin_down_to/ei58z4j/,Poultry22,1552147414

...it strikes me that Serbia appears to better fare than some neighbors. People (young elites) are not fleeing the country to work abroad, and the country apparently offers attraction to immigrants, who mainly come to work. Look at the numbers (diaspora % / immigrants %): Serbia 10.5 / 8.6 -- Romania 17.5 / 1.1 -- Bulgaria 16.5 / 1.4 -- Bosnia  43.3 / 0.9.

A small news site needs to pay a lot of money in photo licenses, Facebook can throw all those same pictures online for users to see and not pay anything. This is to me a step in the right direction to hold those platforms accountable.

I would also much rather have a combined copyright law in the whole EU. But this means a complete rewrite of all copyright laws in over 2 dozen countries, because the directive does not change copyright itself, it is about enforcement of it.

620,"Even on other scales that don't rely on GDP (which is skewed by multilationals) Ireland performs far above average due to IT and pharma sectors.

&amp;#x200B;

These sectors are high skill and high output in terms of productivity which drags Ireland's productivity indexes up and disguises some older and more inefficient industries. Public utilities, agriculture, food&amp;drink all need a huge overhaul.

&amp;#x200B;

An example of this is water as a utility. Ireland has struggled and failed to introduce water charges (removed in the 80s or 90s as an election ploy) to help repair failing infrastructure. Outside of the cities most people rely on rural water schemes that are part of a ""Friendly Society"" system founded (in the 1870s I think?) and subsequently abandoned by the British because of inefficiency. Ireland has never reformed this and its pretty awful.

&amp;#x200B;

So Ireland is definitely above average in terms of productivity, probably the same or a little higher than Germany but this figure comes from a narrow base, making it vulnerable to market shocks, and also disguises other industries that could be far more efficient.

My argument is that there is a lot more ""small crimes"" happening than ""big crimes"", not a very technical name, but I hope you know what I mean. And in those small crimes being able to communicate, understand and empathize with the people involved is extremely important. So if we're just talking by genetics women, will be more predisposed to those characteristics.

In the ""big crimes"", in ""combat situations"" physical capabilities will be the most important . So again by genetics, men will be a lot more predisposed for this.  (although in some cases it is still possible to defuse situation before it gets into a ""combat situation"")

660,"Reporter reveals how Germany ignored warnings of terrorists

Refugees at the German border

In the refugee crisis, heads of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) and politicians are said to have ignored warnings of possible terrorists and criminals.  This is suggested by at least one book under the title ""Geheimakte Asyl: Wie die Politik in der Fl√ºchtlingsfrage Deutschlands Sicherheit gef√§hrdet"" (""Secret file on asylum: how politics endangers Germany's security in the refugee issue"").



Author of the book is Stefan Meining, terror expert of the Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR).  His credo: ""For far too long, in times of the great influx of refugees, the political maxim has been that there is no security problem.  Police and secret services were aware of the risk.



Because of the high number of refugees, the BAMF had begun at the end of 2014 to process asylum applications from people from Syria, Iraq and Eritrea in an accelerated written procedure.  All they had to do was fill out a questionnaire.  The aim: to resolve the constantly growing backlog of applications and speed up the processing.  The terror expert writes about this in his book:



""The BAMF security experts' warning of the consequences of the written hearings sounds (...) urgent.  At present, 'only limited information on applicants from Syria, Iraq and Eritrea can be made available to the security authorities'.  (...) Once again, the experts at the BAMF point out that 'a personal hearing of the applicant remains desirable from the point of view of safety.  It should not be replaced by a questionnaire'.""



Insider: Every control function is deliberately put on the back burner

During this time, the BAMF staff was also massively increased.  The author writes of ""lightning instructions"" within a few days.  Employees of other authorities also switch to the BAMF at times.  Old-serving employees would find with concern that the new employees ""lack any sensitivity for security issues"".  
  


""For many years, the BAMF has been the first authority within the German security architecture to collect information on asylum seekers.  In autumn 2015, this outpost will almost completely disappear.  Every control function is deliberately put on the back burner, despite all security concerns.  Otherwise the BAMF would have collapsed completely, and 'the population would not have understood that', says an insider with excellent relations to the German security services: 'That's why it had to be pretended it was running.  The child had already fallen into the well.'""



""Warnings remained secret; to this day""

Meining also writes in his book about a warning from the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution against infiltrated IS fighters.  The author describes it as ""alarming news"", which the Germans did not hear about, but which also remained without consequences on the political side:



""According to a note from the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), supporters of the so-called Islamic state and other groups have 'disguised inconspicuously as refugees on their way to Europe'.  The BfV speaks in particular of male persons who pretend to be Kurds from Mossul.  (...) These warnings remain secret to this day.  And for good reason: the Federal Office's warning stands in sharp contrast to the public statements of German politicians and security experts.""



Meining's book gives a detailed overview of the - for the most part already known - grievances in Germany's refugee authority.  He also deals with the affair involving the former head of the authorities Jutta Cordt and the case of the Bundeswehr officer Franco A..  To this end, the terror expert held talks with numerous employees of German security authorities, who also gave him insight into confidential documents.



Political attitude of the author becomes clear

When reading the book, the political attitude of the author does not remain unhidden.  He uses terms such as ""opening of borders"" and ""uncontrolled immigration"".  Elsewhere, he accuses the Chancellor of not having been interested in security issues.  ""The Paladins followed her,"" he writes.  ""Whoever dared to point out security problems at that time had to reckon with bitter criticism and even violent insults,"" he writes, ignoring that the security issue in the course of the refugee influx was one of the predominant debates of that time.  Meining does not support his thesis.

No, of course not, but grammatical gender really does have nothing to do with sex. In Romanian and many other languages, every object has a gender.

Now, of course, you're probably mostly talking about nouns describing occupations and the like. But I don't think it's a huge issue. In Romanian, we either have feminine versions of most of those (profesor - profesoara / doctor - doctorita) or a ""Mrs/Miss"" can be added in front to identify the person as female.

Ironically, in professional settings, using those feminine versions is barring a few exceptions a little bit frowned upon and you'd be seen as more respectful if you used the male ones, by the women themselves.

717,"No, because you messed up on a fundamental point. There's no way for the UK to leave without giving up on every other aspect of the agreement, but there is no mechanism to stop the UK from existing the deal.

China is an example of a country that maliciously breaks provisions in most if not in every international deal it ever made. The consequences are rounds upon rounds of talks, trying to get them to maybe partially comply.

This scenario is one where the UK would exit (as you your self so nicely put it) the agreement do to actual or perceived bad faith on the EU's side. There is not a country on the planet that would alter its own trade policy with the UK based on that.

Legally, the UK can defend it self in two ways. First, by invoking parliamentary sovereignty. Parliament is sovereign and can do anything except imposing limits on future Parliaments. This is how the government beats any domestic challenge. Second, internationally, the UK would simply have to invoke the Rebus sic stantibus clause. This is a fundamental maxim of internal law stating that agreements can be voided if the underlying circumstances have changed so significantly that the agreement no longer serves it's initial purpose.

All of your posts are nonsense. They stem from a fundamental lack of understanding of how international law and customs actually work. International agreements do not have exit clauses. They do not need exit clauses. Any country can remove it self from any agreement at any time for any reason. You might have read about the plethora of canceled arms trades between Western countries and Saudi Arabia. None of those had language that would allow for them to be unilaterally called and yet they were, without issue.

The one and only consequence of the UK not wanting to respect the backstop is the cancellation of all associated deals the UK agreed to with the EU. A no deal Brexit. That's it.

Having said that, I studied sociology and yes, There's a lot of ""gender noise"". It's certainly a problem within the social sciences but everyone seems afraid of confronting it.

IMO feminism is being used by a certain profile of activist as a very useful significant for their political strategies.

I'm in part guilty of that, I turned down a career in academia because I couldn't see myself fighting against that the rest of my life.

&gt;  The maps on this page show land surface temperature anomalies for  February 11-25, 2019. Reds and oranges depict areas that were hotter  than average for the same two-week period from 2000-2012; blues were  colder than average. White pixels were normal, and gray pixels did not  have enough data, most likely due to excessive cloud cover. This  temperature anomaly map is based on data from the Moderate Resolution  Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA‚Äôs [Terra](https://terra.nasa.gov/) satellite.  
&gt;  
&gt;Note that the map depicts land surface temperatures (LSTs), not air  temperatures. LSTs reflect how hot the surface of the Earth would feel  to the touch and can sometimes be significantly hotter or cooler than  air temperatures.  
&gt;  
&gt;  The high temperatures were the product of a large area of high pressure that stalled and trapped warm air over Europe. The clear, dry conditions  allowed more sunshine to warm the ground. (February 2019 was the second  sunniest on record for the United Kingdom as a whole.) The  high-pressure system also drew in warm air from the North Atlantic near the Canary Islands.

The far-right will gain a lot of seats, but they will still be (vastly) outnumbered by actual pro-EU parties. EPP, S&amp;D, ALDE and LREM, for instance, will have just over 400 seats, which is enough for a majority vote.

We should be wary of the rise of the far-right, cause in my opinion they suck balls and want to destroy the EU from within, but we shouldn't exaggerate and let it control the elections. ALDE will gain some seats as well. According to some [polls](https://europeelects.eu/), even a lot. LREM (Macron's party) will get about 22 seats.

I was actually surprised that Black Panther opened with ""long before the age of men ..."" or something like that because I felt that wouldn't be PC enough or something to use the word ""men"" like that to just mean ""humans"".",,/r/europe/comments/aysx0t/german_academics_and_authors_call_for_end_to/ei4jo4x/,hoere_des_heeren,1552114314

He basically says that languages arent equivalent in how they convey meaning. In Sanskrit the characters in fact describe how to hold the mouth to make a sound, and the person's mind interprets a meaning ontop of that. While in Chinese the meaning comes first and the person places a sound/character to represent it. The effect is that Canskrit never changed in how it was written, and Chinese constantly changes and is mutually unintelligible across regions. European languages lie somewhere in the middle between that spectrum.

People would just write however they pleased.

So yes: making things like these mandatory is the only way. It won't come naturally, because our written languages are not natural. They're all codified and constructed. I can assure you that you don't talk like a dictionary because you most likely talk a dialect as we all do, but writing in a dialect would quickly get very cumbersome when trying to communicate with others.

However, looking spoken language, the argument doesn't hold up at all.

1359,"&gt; I didn't feel the need to be specific because I was hoping that the audience would be educated enough to understand the difference without it being explicitly pointed out to them.

I was asking for specific measures you used for your arbitrary ranking because *you* didn't supply them. 

&gt; I guess I was wrong, as your comment and the general reaction has demonstrated. 

If you assumed that people are able to mind-read your internal reasoning process, then you were indeed very wrong.

&gt; cultural influence/soft power (where the UK has no European rival)

What cultural influence are you talking about here? Last time I checked the biggest cultural exporter was the US, Japan also comes close, the UK? It's known for drinking lots of tea, the Beatles, Mr Bean and jokes about the queen, stuff that *used* to be all the rage, like *decades* ago.

Which brings us to ""soft power"", if the UK would have the heaps of that, like you keep implying it does have, then it wouldn't have to act like a beggar towards the EU surrounding everything Brexit, yet here we are.

&gt; military might (where again the UK stands well above all her European rivals besides France)

Which would be a major factor in a game of Risk or had been a major factor 100 years ago, but nowadays it isn't. Btw: I love your usage of ""rivals"" to describe these difference like everything has to be some kind of dick-measuring contest.

&gt; etc... (never mind London's complete financial, cultural and institutional dominance where no rival does, or likely ever will, pose any sort of challenge) 

That's now your third metric ""etc"", after undefined ""cultural influence"" and ""military might"", declaring London's dominance over all things ""financial, cultural (what is it with you and culture?) and institutional"", like that's just an inherent attribute of it's geographical location and getting there had nothing at all to do with being so tightly integrated with mainland Europe through the EU.

And because it is like that, it will always be like that, it's not like a lot of business will suddenly end up in place likes Frankfurt instead because ""much dominance, no challengers!"", right?


&gt; Also, I never mentioned that the UK would have more global clout if any of its constituent parts were to leave (where on earth did I suggest that?). 

You are implying it because that's exactly the kind of reasoning you are using to justify how the UK would suddenly be more influential without the EU than with the EU. 

In that context the EU is just another version of the UK and the UK breaking away from it is very comparable to Ireland/Scotland breaking away from the UK, the smaller partner that left will very likely always be in a worse bargaining position, while compromise based on cooperation means progress for all involved parties.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/ayoe8d/people_will_blame_the_eu_if_brexit_ends_in/ei3vddl/,Nethlem,1552089770

I¬¥d like to cmment on this.
The british decision is - for most observers - founded on irrationality and an overinflated sense of self importance. That¬¥s all fine but they shouldnt expect respect for it. It is pretty much evident by now that both sides - and many EU27 onlookers, by the way- probably did not have the faintest idea what the EU actually does on a day to day basis.

Now, aside from what the EU27 view as a generalized stupidity, the real issue is that every European WILL face negative consequences because of this decision. I know it¬¥s going to bring economic downturn. I know it is going to make a possible recession (which should happen anyway soon) harsher. I know it will hurt my line of work, and at the same time, i dare not change careers even though I see available opportunities . I know british people that will be directly hurt by it.

You¬¥re damn right it should be difficult to leave - but it actually isnt. Running a deeply integrated first rate economy out of it¬¥s established framework into a new one is. ",,/r/europe/comments/ayq9u0/may_says_brexit_may_never_happen_at_all/ei3me8h/,Onkel24,1552082548

1557,"I feel everyone saying ""well duh he shouldn't have picked up an explosive grenade, that's so obvious"" really has never been in a roudy protest, nor has ever seen how that specific grenade operates. 

Stupid or not, all over the world it is now common if not normal for people to kick or throw back tear gas grenade, it's just a fact. The main issue at hand (no pun intended here) is that this specific grenade is...well pretty fucking evil, and designed in a way that would make injuries absolutely inevitable, let me explain:

It is a GLI-F4 grenade: an ""instantaneous"" tear gas grenade. When it is thrown, it starts emitting tear gas, like a normal tear gas pellet/grenade, it doesn't explode, and behaves like ALL other non explosive grenades. The trick is that it also contains more than 20 grams of TNT (ya you read that right). This detonates a grenade which has of now was behaving like a ""harmless"" tear gas cannister into well, something akin to a ""weak"" fragmentation grenade/flash bang (the TNT is supposedly there for noise and shock purposes).

So now you have a poor sap, who is perhaps not overly used to protests (like the Gilets Jaunes, who for the most part were not part of any political org / social movements before the start of their thing in December, and have little to no protest experience), literally drowned in tear gas (just look at how much is used in those settings by the french cops, you can't see shit anymore), sees people throwing shit back so that people can breath and see again. The poor sap sees one of those GLI-F4 grenade roll to his feet, sees it starts spreading gas, and you can guess the rest: he picks it up, only to have it blow up before he could even start a throwing movement. 

Hand blown, bye. If not foot lacerated / blown up if he had not picked it up.

There is a reason why people do not pick up the other type of ""boom"" grenade being used: the rubber pellet grenade. That's because that one is designed to look like a pineapple grenade, it's scary as fuck, doesn't spread gas, and behaves as one would expect.

The GLI-F4 is literally designed in a way to confuse people and cause injuries. 

Interestingly, even the French government has understood how fucking murderous this piece of shit equipment is (I mean, it did kill someone in a ZAD not so long ago): they decided to ""stop"" using it.

The massive population growth in the 19th and 20th century Europe was the result of the demographic shift happening, not a normal feature of any society. And that's a good thing, because most of the world is now at least in phase 3 of the shift, meaning that while the population still grows, the birth rates are down to around 2.

The phases are

1. high birth rates, but also high child mortality, so the population stays about the same
2. child mortality drops, birth rates stay high, population grows quickly
3. birth rates drop, but population keeps growing due to previously high birth rates
4. things have evened out

Now, the problem with our retirement system is that it was developed somewhere around phase two or three, so there were few old people and paying for them was easy.

Second, and probably more importantly, the constitutions of most countries prohibit prosecutions for something that wasn't a time at the crime it was done.

1657,"&gt;There's people who are intersex and that's biological.

Intersex between which sexes? Also, intersex is a birth defect. All fetuses start as female, something goes wrong in the process of becoming male, and a few end up botched.

&gt;I've known few mares who act like stallions. It would be interesting. Or, they just act like mares because we don't put cultural significance in this behavior.

Why does this come as a surprise? Most if not all of our behaviours are shared, but the difference lies in what extent they are shared. And outliers (feminine men and tomboys) don't prove anything but the fact that we're the same species.

&gt;Ok, give me evidence about the proven differences between women and men from infancy.

There are assloads of literature on this subject. I'll give you a couple of examples.

https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7f84/8898be00e243a9c8748b453c1f3420292345.pdf

*""Sex differences in early infancy suggest that the seeds of sexlinked behavior are sown in very early life.""*

https://www.city.ac.uk/news/2016/july/infants-prefer-toys-typed-to-their-gender,-says-study

*""Stereotypical toy preferences were found for boys and girls in each of the age groups, demonstrating that sex differences in toy preference appear early in development. Both boys and girls showed a trend for an increasing preference with age for toys stereotyped for boys.""*

https://www.math.kth.se/matstat/gru/5b1501/F/sex.pdf

*""Results showed that the male infants showed a stronger interest in the physical-mechanical mobile while the female infants showed a stronger interest in the face.""*

Then consider that toy preferences in rhesus monkeys, a species separated from us by millions of years, mirror that of human children. This heavily supports the position of gender differences being innate (animal) behaviour: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2583786/

Then there's the detail of men's and women's brains being different:

https://books.google.no/books?id=JFpq6hYQRhQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=no#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763413003011

And there's the wealth of recorded differences between adult men and women in a multitude of psychological traits, including aggression, risk-taking, neuroticism, and so on:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_psychology#Psychological_traits

Finally, I can direct you to a documentary from my home country that discusses this topic and shows the sort of quackery that goes on in an ideologised academia:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVaTc15plVs

Fun fact: Some time after this documentary was released, the Norwegian research council defunded their gender research programme in its entirety. A rare victory for sanity.

It's basically a meme at this point because they've been doing these studies over and over again for decades and the results never change. Despite this and despite being intuitively true, the presence of innate gender differences is somehow still controversial and surprising. It only goes to show how effective and insidious the pseudoscientific gender ideological lobbying has been in western society.",,/r/europe/comments/axwam2/female_researchers_in_europe_in_2015/ei31wt6/,Patsy02,1552067984

1664,"The 14 characteristics are:

   1 Powerful and Continuing Nationalism

    Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.

  2  Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights

    Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of ""need."" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.

  3  Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause

    The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.

    4Supremacy of the Military

    Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.

5    Rampant Sexism

    The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy.

    6Controlled Mass Media

    Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.

7    Obsession with National Security

    Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.

   8 Religion and Government are Intertwined

    Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.

 9   Corporate Power is Protected

    The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.

   10 Labor Power is Suppressed

    Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed .

 11   Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts

    Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.

12    Obsession with Crime and Punishment

    Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.

 13   Rampant Cronyism and Corruption

    Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.

 14   Fraudulent Elections

    Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.

Forcing these ""allies"" to massively increase defence spending will make the whole continent safe.

Both the UK and USA should exit NATO and thus force the Europeans to take responsibility for their own defence.

&gt;With that I agree which is why I offered my slightly differently nuanced interpretation.

Which I suppose might suggest that my initial point about empire having nothing to do with it is reasonable enough? Because then it's a relatively reasonable argument about how leaving the EU will impact the relevancy of the UK in trade and political terms, and obviously remain voters see leaving as doing more harm than good to that, while leave voters see it as doing more good than harm (which takes us to the pooled vs individual sovereignty issues, which is a long, and winding road that comes down to ideology more than practicality..).

1810,"&gt; about South Africa without knowing the history of the place and the background and actual nature of that proposal.

I know both. The proposal, coming from a man who regularly calls for white people to be rounded up and slaughtered, calls for the government to have the right to confiscate land from white people by force and redistribute it to the black majority. The justification is that white people make up less than 20% of the population, but own something like 60% of the land.

I hate to break it to you, but in something like 100 years, when white people make up 10% of the German population, they‚Äôll still probably own more than 60% of the land. Sure, in this case it will be because it‚Äôs fheir ancestral homeland rather than because of colonial conquest, but I doubt that will make much of a difference. These people aren‚Äôt going to stop hating you just because they move to your country.

1812,"Reddit does have two main purposes:

Sharing content. This is often user created but even user creations are under copyright as every user is a content creator. Not only big companies have the right to produce copyrighted material. Prominent examples of copyrighted content created on Reddit are posts by /u/Poem_for_your_sprog/ or /u/SmallLebowsky. Equally often links to copyrighted content are distributed. If you look a the front page right now most posts there fall under these two categories. There are only a few where it can be argued that there is no significant artistic work or which are just short texts.

File sharing sites should check for that, no questions asked. But fuzzy filters have to be strictly forbidden. And there have to be prevention mechanisms and fines for abusing the system.

Advertising providers do allow upload of copyrighted work for a fee. Its their main source of income. That even huge companies have problems to only use correct content is obvious from cases like new malware which [often spreads trough advertising networks](https://www.businessinsider.de/android-malware-spreads-using-google-adsense-advertising-network-kaspersky-researchers-2016-8?r=US&amp;IR=T). Of course I see little risk for democracy by filtering advertisements, but these are definitely affected services.

&gt; ... covered by the exception for ""not for profit scientific or educational repositories as well as not-for-profit online encyclopedias""

No. Just because they offer free media they are not covered by this clause. Hosting is expensive, especially for media hosting sites. Because of this most free media databases finance [over advertisements](http://piqs.de/), making small profits. This excludes them from ""not for profit"". Others finance via other means, e.g. freesound.org has a [commercial API](https://blog.freesound.org/?p=978).

&gt;if Article 13 is to target any potential provider of copyrighted material, why does it go out of its way to define a specific subset of those and provides numerous exceptions?

You know as well as I do, that these exception were not there in the initial proposal. These have been added step by step in the negotiations as more and more cases with valid concerns popped up. That is why these exceptions are there and because of the inherent risk to miss cases that is the wrong approach to target specific sites.

&gt;O.k.? So let's say the German government puts in a demand to filter all holocaust denial. How are you going to catch that without a fuzzy filter?

Besides that a non fuzzy filter can easily be changed into a fuzzy one once the infrastructure is there I will not pick holocaust deniers as an example. Do not try to color me that way.

Lets go with Manfred Webers claim that he did not try to move the date for the vote. This was exposed as a lie so lets say he wants to erase it and has free access to the filter database.

He puts in the news articles and and forum posts which currently prominently discuss the topic, removing them from the net. New ones will spawn up. But everything that gets big will be silenced too. Of course people who follow the cause will still see it, but the general public is far less likely to be reached.

1845,"&gt;Not u/Scuipici, but honestly when you read the statements of some UK government figures about how the Germans or the French or Japan or whatever will fall over themselves to make deals with independent sovereign UK, it does sound a bit like the bluster of old Britan. The arrogance and detachment from facts of these talking heads really finds parallels with those times .

I mean to be fair, the EU is trying to put together trade agreements with all of its large trading partners (it tried with the US, has done with Japan etc..) that isn't so much a suggestion that the UK is arrogant, or harking back to empire, it's more that the UK is a very large, modern economy. I'm reasonably sure that you'd agree that the EU will be keen to put in place an FTA with the EU (one that benefits the EU obviously), that is essentially the same line.

&gt;When some say Brexiters dream of the Empire it might just be that they refer to this type of self-confidence which would have been understandable from a British political leader in the early 20th century but just looks ridiculous today. At least that's how I interpret it.

Those are two very different things though. The UK has every reason to be confident given it is a regional power, it does have a very large economy, it is internationally engaged, has considerable hard and soft power etc.. If anything it's the claim that as a 'small country' the UK will just be trampled by the rest of the world that tends to come across as absurd. The UK outside of the EU will not be a weak, small country any more than France or Germany would be, it's in the top 10 globally in almost everything.

If you are suggesting that the claim that UK leavers are fixated on empire is actually a claim that UK leavers don't think that the UK is a small, inconsequential country then I'd agree. But to me those two claims are very very different..

1873,"&gt;Even if the alliance with Stalin was necessary, which I doubt given US production capability and nuclear advantage

Your comment makes no sense at all, you seem to be confusing the timeline of the war. The USA joined the allies AFTER the Soviets had already been attacked by the Axis. That means that they automatically - and by necessity - were allies with the Soviets since they were both attacked by the same enemy. Their nuclear advantage has no place in this conversation because it was non-existent. Ignoring the fact that we're talking about atomic weapons (not nuclear ones), by the time the USA joined the war the Manhattan Project had barely began. There was no case of them having ""nuclear superiority"". It wasn't even certain that they'd develop atomic weapons before the Germans yet. You speak with a certainty that didn't exist at all at the time. 

Neither major power could have won this war without the others. There's simply no scenario where the USA doesn't ally with the Soviets when they both have the same enemy and we're talking about a global-scale conflict. They certainly couldn't afford to be like ""nah, we got this, we can fight the Germans AND the Japanese alone"" and even if they said it, how exactly would that work? There would be both American and Soviet troops fighting the Germans. It would be the same thing in the end.

&gt; they should have marched right on towards Moscow after dealing with Germany.

Sure that makes sense. They had just managed to end a world war that costed everyone tens of millions of lives and they would just casually start a war against their own ally that majorly contributed in Germany's defeat, just cause ""commies = bad"".

1950,"The french nuclear aicraft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle departed yesterday from Toulon for the mission ‚ÄúClemenceau‚Äù an operational deployment that will last until july. The departure has been saluted by the Minister of Defence Florence Parly.
The carrier, has recently completed a 18 months long mid life refit which rejuvinated her by repleneshing her nuclear reactors, replecing her radars and other systems, [the ship] is now truly the ‚ÄúRafale house‚Äù. With the retirement from service of the Super Etendard and the convertion to the Rafale M of the third and last squadron of the Navy‚Äôs Aviation, the unit has been optimised for the support of the sole Dassault aircraft. The recent FANAL training excercise, the prelude of the current mission, has seen [the unit] make a record with the embarkation of well 30 Rafale, that is almost the totality of the 3 squadrons and of the entire Rafale M fleet (44 aircrafts).
The air wing embarked for Clemenceau is composed by a standard complement of 2 squadrons, with 20 Rafale, supported by 2 E-2C Hawkeye for radar alert, 1 NH-90 Cayman helicopter and by 2 Dauphin. The [fleet] escort is made up by the Horizon class destroyer the Forbin, and the FREMM class frigate the Provence. The suplly ship the Marne, and the nuclear submarine the Rubis, complete the task group, which will also be reinforced by units from allied navies and the temporary inclusion of the (FREMM frigate) Languedoc in the Mediterrenean, and by the (F70 frigate) Latouche Treville in the Indian Ocean. The carrier will spend the first month in the Mediterrenean, contributing to the operations in Syria (Operation Chammal, for the french) only to then cross the Suez Canal headed for the Indian Ocean, where in May will take part of the VARUNA joint training operation together with the Indian Navy. The task group will stay in the Indian Ocean and South-East Asia until june, representing France at the Shangri-La Summit in Singapore and taking part to a training excercise with japanese units. Contrary to what was initially rumored, there dosen‚Äôt seem to be any intention to push towards the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean.
On the way home, the unit will train together with the Egyptian Navy (RAMES excercise). One british Type 45 destroyer should also join the task group at a later date, and the carrier will also be accompanied, for various variable periods of time, by the danish Nieals Juel frigate, the portuguese Corte Real ship and by italian, dutch, australian and american units.

2072,"I will try to answer your questions in Julias place.

&gt; Why do you think this is applicable to ""all but very few sites (those both tiny and very new)""?

Article 13 paragraph 4aa of the current proposal its there are the following limits imposed: The service has to be less than 3 years old, has to have less than 10 million annual turnover and has to have less than 5 million unique visitors per month. violation one of these 3 criteria is very easy. Of course static websites like the promotion site of a company are excluded, but even for fora it can be argued that they serve the purpose to share copyrighted content like code snippets or images in an image board. There the definition is vague but clear exceptions are rare.

Article 13 4aa for reference:

&gt;Member States shall provide that when new online content sharing service providers whose
services have been available to the public in the Union for less than three years and which
have an annual turnover below EUR 10 million within the meaning of the Commission
Recommendation 2003/361/EC, the conditions applicable to them under the liability regime
set out in paragraph 4 are limited to the compliance with the point (a) of paragraph 4 and to
acting expeditiously, upon receiving a sufficiently substantiated notice, to remove the notified
works and subject matters from its website or to disable access to them.
Where the average number of monthly unique visitors of these service providers exceeds 5
million, calculated on the basis of the last calendar year, they shall also demonstrate that they
have made best efforts to prevent further uploads of the notified works and other subject
matter for which the rightholders have provided relevant and necessary information.

Next question:

&gt;Why do you think websites which have the explicit purpose of sharing copyrighted material for profit should not make an effort to acquire rights to such material first?

Julia does not think this. She made proposals herself where she presented other ways to get the money these site earn to rightholders. Julia and the pirate parties just think that article 13 is the wrong way to do so as it requires upload filter technology.

&gt;Why do you think that these requirements, which are demanding ""best effort"" only, which are limited to ""specific works"" and which explicitely demand that ""quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody or pastiche."" are not affected and are limited to ""which should not go beyond what is necessary"" will lead to broad upload filters?

In recital 38b it is stated that technology should be ""state of the art"" to filter copyrighted content. Having both Paragraph 4 which demands filtering of uploaded content once it was made known to the service and article 5 which demands that these filters should not make errors it is reasonable to assume that fuzzy filters may be required. Collecting societies do huge investments in lobbyism and will not tolerate copyrighted content not being filtered because of single byte changes.

&gt;Why do you think that despite the requirement for ""rightholders to provided the service providers with the relevant and necessary information"" that said providers have to ""buy licences for anything that users may possibly upload ‚Äì that is: all copyrighted content in the world.""?

If this law is implemented there will quickly be services which allow a rightholder to ""provide the relevant  and necessary information"" to all platforms. These platform then have two options: Filter all of it, because no plattform has the possibility to check all copyright claims of the world, or to acquire licenses for everything, which is also impossible. In the best case a flatrate model will be established for platforms, but if single content creators do not agree this fails.

---------------------

The last two parts also come with further problems, even if upload filters are not fuzzy:

It is easy to submit wrong claims and take down content which is not wished for by some party. This has been demonstrated with Youtubes Content-ID and will have a far larger impact if upload filter technology spreads to more sites. An example of this [here](https://juliareda.eu/2018/08/censorship-machines-gonna-censor/).  
[An example for Youtubes Content-ID here](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/8k57y2/huge_youtube_scam_false_content_id_claims_do/).  
[And numerous others by searching for them](https://www.qwant.com/?q=abuse%20content%20id%20false%20claim)

A centralized content filtering system is very attractive for further censorship measures. [This already resulted in calls to filter terrorism content](https://torrentfreak.com/eu-members-approve-upload-filters-for-terrorist-content-181214/). As has been show in numerous laws from recent time (at least in Germany), anti-terrorism measures will soon be used against regular criminals too.
So add child porn, add weapons, add drugs to the filters. It does not require a big step then to add unwanted opinions.

Ok, give me evidence about the proven differences between women and men from infancy. I mean they have been proven shaky but go on. The mating strategies too please. That's an interesting one.

Who knows, we can't ask horses about what they think about their gender. I've known few mares who act like stallions. It would be interesting. Or, they just act like mares because we don't put cultural significance in this behavior.

Ok you are one of those idiots... There's people who are intersex and that's biological. Hormones or the lack of hormones is biological. Brain chemistry matters.

2218,"&gt; Italians always crap on their media because of Mediaset and the tabloids, and because Italian political culture is frequently so depressing.

What the hell are you talking about? Last time Corriere was any good it, I was still in high school. Nowadays the only paper worth buying and reading is Sole 24 Ore. The rest is crap. And no, this is not an Italian engaging in shitting over his media as a favourite sport: this is the truth and factual reality.

&gt; Corriere offers some excellent reportage, and so, for example, does La Stampa. Like any newspaper, you have to find it inside the papers. It's not going to find you. Excavation is necessary. National dailies are like that. Some of the political analysis of Italian affairs in L'Unita is excellent, and so is what you get in Fanpage, which can be surprisingly good.

Again, I can read. And all the things about Khashoggi, Climate Change, Trump trade war, etc that I know, I owe it to foreign media. I wish I could inform myself on Italian media, the problem is that Italian journalists (the majority of them, not all of them) are the typical 9-5 workers who don't really give a shit as far as they're being paid. The only time I see some commitment from our journalists, is when someone attacks one of them or someone is mistreating one of them. The rest of the time, it's just a job like any other.

&gt;Italian news photographers, especially covering the refugee crisis and war in Syria, are really exceptional and so are a lot of your television reporters, many of whom go on to work for European agencies, and really excel. The grass is always greener on the other side.

Oh sure, we have good journalists, I am not saying EVERYONE is shit. Again, you're putting words I've never written in my mouth.

2248,"&gt; In that case, Article 13(5) applies. It says that the implied filters in Article 13(4)b should not ever result in legitimate works being taken offline, including any works covered by exceptions. It also explicitly says that quotations, criticisms, reviews and caricatures must be except from copyright. 

just because the directive describes a perfect upload filter does not create one. 

""Upload filters that take offline content that just resembles the original are not required.""
If this would be true than the whole filtering does not work anymore. I would just sqlightly change a single pixel in a protected work and reupload it. 

What you describe is a scenario in which only exact copies would be targeted but if this were true, than the whole Article 13 would have no effect in reality. Do you really think that the parliament is referring to such a useless action that could be bypassed by changing a single pixel in an image or removing the last 0.2 seconds of a movie or song?

But I guess, Voss himself showed that it's not as simple as you think when he said in an interview to Handelsblatt (https://orange.handelsblatt.com/artikel/56303) (rough translation)

This is far from guaranteed. An example of infrastructure that wasn't worth it would be all the stuff Brazil built for the Olympics.

I think the Chinese government massively overestimates the importance of infrastructure due to its efficacy in its own specific case. Infrastructure was incredibly important during China's development because its early stages were driven by an almost unslakeable demand for its goods by the developed world and infrastructure improvements allowed more and more of that demand to be met. 

Infrastructure facilitates growth, but doesn't drive it. Many of these countries have other bottlenecks to their growth. They simply do not produce enough medium or high value goods that anyone wants, so what's the infrastucture going to help them produce and sell? 

The terms of these loans are actually quite generous considering, but the cost of them is often huge in comparison to the country's economy - they need to have a pretty big impact to be worth it, and to be repayable. 

That's the case even if the infrastructure is good quality. Obviously, some of it isn't, like the bridge that collapsed in Kenya. Whether these countries have the ability and will to hold these construction companies to high standards is a big question mark, considering that they've historically been hamstrung by corruption.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/ay12sl/brussels_says_eu_has_underestimated_chinas_reach/ei1ptda/,SuddenGenreShift,1552017543

2478,"I'm not too knowledgeable about these articles, but I'd like to learn more.
So thanks for clarifying these things.

&gt; This is not the case, as the article is actually quite specific in what it applies to. Please see this other comment of mine.

It *should* be specific - but the text isn't, as /u/anlumo pointed out correctly. And unless these things are cleared up and well documented, it should not be passed.

&gt; They don't have to do anything. See paragraph 5.

Again: Very vague.

What about organizations like Wikipedia *even* if they are used by for-profit companies as backend. What prevents companies from moving all their user-uploads into a non-profit? We already see companies moving copyrighted works into a user-upload section with little moderation - and I *bet* they'll ask for exemptions / split their business. In the gaming world, see Steam for an example of what I mean Steam Workshop (non-profit section + copyright violations tolerated) vs. Steam Store (for-profit section + strict about violations).

Large non-profit platforms like Wikipedia (even if it doesn't apply to them) needs a large amount of money to operate, so who is going to judge how much of it has to be spent on such copyright measures?

Also what about people operating a blog / video-channel showing other peoples creations, who receive monthly donations? Are they creating their content for-profit? What's the threshold?

What if I license my content under a license that allows commercial use, and some for-profit companies starts contributing to my project?
What if I use a companies for-profit works in my own public project and accept other contributions? Does that make my organization a for-profit against my will? Will I have to reject such contributions?
I feel like these directives focus too much on a ""platform owner"" / ""platform user"" model, when the internet is heading towards a collaborative open-space where these lines are blurred.

You are also implying that only platforms will pay for these measures. However, it could also easily become the burden of the user: ""You have to be a member of verifier network XYZ to contribute to our platform! Please log in with your service-id"" (which allows tracking and might cause additional barriers for users). So we could also see ISPs being forced to implement this, which will just strengthen companies like Telekom and others, who will likely create their own smaller networks / parts of the internet, blocking out competition in the process.

The cost might also have to be covered by people who want to submit their copyrighted works to these services so it can't be uploaded elsewhere. Imagine you are an artist and you don't want your content stolen - now these huge services / companies providing such filtering services could (and probably will) be charging users for looking for their content. Such companies do already exist, but I feel like this is a horrible practice as it will make copyright enforcement for individuals much harder than it already is, because it creates an imbalance where right owners can only be heard if they invest large sums of money, as content providers are desensitized and will only listen to a team of lawyers (who are expensive).

&gt; Those people should consider whether their beliefs can be reconciled with their responsibilities. There isn't an opt-out for ""I don't like it"".

I think a decentralized network is very good (and a key idea of the internet) and people should have the option to opt-out of a ""centralized"" network which is mostly run by a small number of companies. However, if all services have to use a service like ""Audible Magic"" you are centralizing the network and some people (rightfully) will not be willing to use such networks anymore.

However, with the internet being required for so many tasks in the modern world (even decentralized ones, like applying for a job at a companies website), this would become an impossible task.

I also see issues with my privacy if all my content is going through a 3rd party on every site I use. This is currently easy to block without a huge loss of compatibility. However, if anything I say or do is on record for ""filtering"" purposes, this would be really bad and if I were to opt-out, this would be problematic. Especially as filtering companies would obviously have interest to store user actions for a long time to retroactively filter content.

Why am *I* being watched and made to suffer from these directives if I'm careful about what I do / upload?
It feels like this isn't a good idea.

&gt; What would they be asking for, exactly?

If these ""copyright enforcement"" / filtering services store most of the copyrighted works, and are a vital backbone of the future internet, what prevents them from blocking users from uploading their works (to allow filtering on other platforms) unless they agree to other terms, such as the ability of publication / redistribution by the service owner.

This is something that companies like Facebook already do for user uploads (take away most of the users rights), and it's likely to also happen to other services. It think it wouldn't be unlikely for these giant filtering companies to start selling users works more-or-less against their will.

If you opt-out of such solutions you'd be locked away in a tiny portion of the internet (which obviously still has to respect copyright - which is indeed not an opt-out)

---

I'm not strictly for or against these articles. I also believe I understand their intend. However, they are very vague and allow too much room for interpretation. So I think those articles should be removed for now, refined, explained / well defined until everyone actually agrees on what they mean and how to implement them.

In my opinion a *much* better solution is to not look at user-uploads, but improve self-moderation.

This could be done by enforcing an ""imprint"" and ""report links"", much like the DMCA TDRs do. But, in my opinion, this should be extended that users can also report third party violations.

I often have issue that my legally redistributed software is illegally packaged with other peoples illegally stolen content. However, as-is, I have very few methods of taking down such illegal copies (which reflect bad on my name if they remain online):

- The gaming industry (the ESA) has a report form for copyright violations, however, *nothing* I ever reported was actually removed and the form was broken on multiple occasions (they don't seem to care).
- Nintendo themselves has an anti-piracy report function, but it focuses on bootleg games, no piracy. Their piracy email address was unreachable last time I tried (they don't seem to care).
- If my license is also violated, I did report via DMCA take down requests, but at least providers like google just ignored that (they don't seem to care).

I think education, improving self-moderation and enforcing existing rules would be much more useful. So rather than pointing the finger at users ""do not upload bad content!"" it should be more about knowing what-not-to-do, self-moderation and reporting illegal content.

If I see someone robbing a bank, I'm told to report this to the police.
However, if I see digital crimes and copyright violations on the internet, I usually can't do that unless I'm the bank owner (copyright owner) being robbed; and even if I report it, I seem to have to report it to the car manufacturer (platform provider) that the robbers drove.

I feel like service providers should have to provide links to more easily report stolen content to them; and governments should provide contact information about what to do if the provider doesn't take care of the issue (before getting lawyers involved), so cases can quickly be reviewed, domains shut down, providers fined etc. - basically I'd like to have an internet police, for reporting crimes as I see them; rather than banning free movement and assuming everyone is a robber (for a lack of a better analogy).",Germany,/r/europe/comments/ayd7mt/hi_reddit_im_julia_reda_an_mep_for_the_pirate/ei1mwpx/,JayFoxRox,1552015032

There's this propaganda that everyone eats up because it sounds good that everyone that meets their NATO requirements are also required to buy US weapons rather than European weapons. That's the same stupid mentality that we MUST buy Huawei 5G instead of Europe being the alternative 5G maker via Nokia. How fucking stupid are people? Pretty stupid

  
If we helped Nokia through government grants push their 5G technology, we could sell to the whole of North America and most of Europe putting Nokia from a meh tech company to one of the most relevant in the whole world. Same goes for our weapons. We need alternatives to everything relevant that the Chinese, Russians, Americans create that are actually on par and not a 3rd option.. and I'm not just talking about parts or missiles, I'm talking about the whole freaking military industrial complex.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so sick of hearing ""NASA this"" or ""NASA that"" .. again we're just watching.

Europes alternative.. yeah. Most engineers at SpaceX were born in the US due to insanely strict laws keeping Elon Musk from hiring more foreigners, same with Boston Dynamics.. but a lot of the rest is European talent. Same with US military engineers, many are from Western Europe.

There's one country in the European Union that's been doing all of the above from attracting new foreign businesses, having more common sense laws, while heavily protecting it's people from foreign threats - that country is Poland and it's people should be proud.

2514,"You can't have subsidies without high taxes. The government doesn't have any money. If you want the State to subsidise any industry, they have to first take the money from you in the form of a tax, and then give them to the industry people. You may be thinking that the government should subsidise only the industry that's important to you, but everyone think the same for themselves, and the things that are important to them. The taxi industry wants subsidies too. The transport industry want subsidies too. Every industry wants subsidies. 10% for this one, 10% for that one, 10% for the other one, and here you have 30% of your income taken away in taxes. 

The reason why your own domestic romanian food is expensive is because of these subsidies. Do you know what is the purpose of these subsidies? It is to maintain a high price for the food. The purpose of these subsidies is not to help you as customer get cheap domestic food, it is to protect the jobs of the farmers at your expense. 

I may say that one of the reasons Romanian agricultural firms aren't as competitive is because they have no reason to be competitive. The purpose of these subsidies is to prevent the farmers from competing in the free market. If they have guaranteed market share at high price, they have no incentive to innovate and invest in productivity. In fact, investing in productivity and becoming more competitive might disqualify them from receiving subsidies. 

So the answer to your question is: subsidies. Because of subsidies that you support you have to pay high taxes. Because of these subsidies your farmers aren't competitive. 

Also, the French people are certainly not benefiting by any means by paying to subsidize their farmers. They get high prices for that, not low prices. They are subsidizing their farmers so they can export their food on lower prices to foreign countries, but sell on high prices on their domestic market. 

Remember, the purpose of the economy is not to create jobs, but to create goods and services that people value. 

Importing subsidised goods is the best kind of charity you can get. The real losers are the tax payers of these countries who pay for all that.

2527,"Paragraph 8 says a whole lot of nothing really. It says a lot of nice words about consulting with various companies and having mechanisms to ensure things, but in the end I have yet to see any ideas on how to actually do this. I keep seeing the words proportionate and effectiveness and best efforts etc, but nowhere have I seen pro-13ers actually attempt to define this. I get that a directive is supposed to not clarify this stuff, but even in outside communications there is very little substance, just a whole lot of ""don't worry it's not going to need content filters everywhere"" and ""it's going to be appropriate trust me"".

The language is all very vague, and to me, as a ""commoner"", such vague language gives off an extremely uncomfortable vibe. Even that comment you linked, which, credit where credit is due it is more readable than most pro-13 material, has a flesch score of 49, which is fairly difficult to read and absolutely not optimal.

They are not the only and not necessarily the biggest problem but they are easy to understand and will have the biggest impact on the average consumer. They may not be not mandatory per law but they will be the only feasible solution.

You say it only affects large websites but the law also applies to smaller websites (most importantly every website in business for more than 3 years). 

For very small forums and websites, it could be possible to check every publication by humans, though you have to remember that some of these sites are run by a single person or small group as a hobby and which means they could most likely only do this sporadic. This in term means you may have to wait for a long time anything you post can go public.

The other problem is how a person should identify copyrighted material. Do they have to know every image, video, text and audiofile? You need software that compares the uploaded files to a database.

2616,"It's actually Germany who was on the fence about joining, in a sense. Germany would not have been prepared to join a currency union and give up the strong Mark and restraint of the Bundesbank without a certain degree of assurances as to how the new currency would be structured. A currency was never going to get off the ground without German support. Ergo Germany enjoyed a certain position of strength. In many ways the ECB is an ideological successor to the pre-99 Bundesbank. No smaller economy had anything approaching that level of influence on the proceedings; the result is that the ECB has quite consistently pursued fiscal policy that benefits large-scale industrial economies of northern Europe, which has had real impacts on the economic development of the south. They were essentially given access to easy money that their own economies did not support and gave up any of the effective methods of responding to financial crises. It's no wonder a debt crisis happened, it was nearly structurally inevitable. 

It's not as though these arguments are novel. Economists have talked about the flaws of the euro all along. Both Piketty and Stiglitz have in fairly recent history (past few years) made pretty compelling cases for ways in which the eurozone needs to be reformed for long term sustainability, which aren't far off from what Sch√§uble is suggesting here.

2622,"Romanian authorities have launched a second investigation into the country‚Äôs ousted former anti-corruption tsar, setting up a showdown with Brussels over efforts to appoint her to a new top EU prosecutor‚Äôs job.

Laura Codruta Kovesi was questioned for five hours in Bucharest on Thursday ‚Äî the same day the European Parliament nominated her to become the first head of the European Public Prosecutor's Office. 

The contrasting moves highlight how Ms Kovesi‚Äôs candidacy, and her own government‚Äôs opposition to it, have become symbols of an escalating EU row over alleged authoritarian creep in member states, including Romania. 

‚ÄúIt just shows how the Romanian government and ruling majority is genuinely in a panic,‚Äù said Oana Popescu, director of the Bucharest-based Global Focus Center think-tank. ‚ÄúIt is a zero-sum game for them: if Kovesi wins, they lose. It should also be a signal to Brussels how determined they are to consolidate their unchecked grip on power.‚Äù

Ms Kovesi was interrogated in relation to the funding of a flight used to return a convict to Romania more than a decade ago, when she was a state prosecutor. She has denied any wrongdoing. 

The interrogation was carried out by a contentious body established last month to investigate judges and prosecutors. Critics see the organisation as a political creation, as it sits outside the jurisdiction of the general prosecutor.

Ms Kovesi denounced her questioning as the ‚Äúcontinuation of a harassment campaign that has been ongoing for two years‚Äù, adding that she was not allowed to be represented by a lawyer. She is also being probed for suspected malfeasance, bribery and perjury, which she denies. 

‚ÄúThere is a desperation to stop me in everything I do because of my candidacy,‚Äù she told journalists and supporters as she emerged from Thursday‚Äôs interrogation. ‚ÄúThey summoned me on the seventh of March knowing that exactly today the European Parliament would vote on my candidacy.‚Äù 

Romania‚Äôs Social Democrat-led government has insisted the cases against Ms Kovesi are not political and are being run according to normal legal process. Bucharest holds the EU‚Äôs rotating presidency.

MEPs voted overwhelmingly to support Ms Kovesi to head the new European prosecutor's office, which will be responsible for probing alleged frauds on EU funds. Liviu Dragnea, the Romanian Social Democrat leader and the country‚Äôs most powerful politician, is under investigation domestically over the alleged misuse of bloc money meant for a road construction project. Mr Dragnea ‚Äî who has separately been convicted twice for corruption and as a result cannot serve as premier ‚Äî has denied any wrongdoing. 

EU officials said there was no formal reason the investigations into Ms Kovesi should derail her candidacy for the prosecutor‚Äôs office job, even should she be indicted.

European Parliament representatives will now liaise with the bloc‚Äôs council of ministers over whether to appoint her, after member states backed a French rival candidate.

Ms Kovesi won fans around Europe for winning convictions against high-level officials during five years as Romania‚Äôs chief anti-corruption prosecutor. She was dismissed in July.

Bucharest has drawn growing criticism from Brussels over changes to its legal system passed by executive order, moves critics say give the Social Democrats increased control over the judiciary. A European Commission report in November warned that Romania risked backsliding on progress in tackling corruption since it joined the EU in 2007.

2637,"&gt; The reality is most US debt is domestically owned. The US dollar's position as a reserve currency probably makes it more stable, but it's not allowing them to live beyond their means anymore than Europeans are. 

The fact that the dollar is a reserve currency is useful in that there is constant demand for dollars and the US can effectively export inflation,  borrow in domestic currency and transact without conversion (everything can be bought and sold, and is priced in dollars..). 

It's more that the US can inject money into its own economy with relative impunity (which isn't internal debt..) without seeing the issues that say, Poland would if it tried to do the same, it can also sustain massive government deficit spending, which acts to stimulate the US domestic economy as a result. I mean, just for context, the Entire German Federal budget (the federal bit is important..) will remain below $380bn with a surplus, US federal spending on the other hand is close o $3.8tn with a deficit of almost $800bn... Even given the size of the total US economy, that is a lot of public sector spending to add activity..

While the US spending spree has probably gone on somewhat too long at this point, large-scale bailout programs and government investment to get the economy moving were incredibly effective at beating the recession. Comparatively speaking, the eurozone stagnated.

2658,"&gt; All these points have one problem in common: There have to be precedent cases in courts (like what means cost-efficient at the time of the upload? What are expensive filters?) or very precise requirements.

Not necessarily... Don't forget, this is not the final version. This is just the draft member states take to their parliaments and base legislation on. 

In fact, Article 13 has a whole paragraph dedicated to answering your question. Article 13(9):

&gt; As of [date of entry into force of this Directive] the Commission in cooperation with the Member States shall organise stakeholder dialogues to discuss best practices for the cooperation between the online content sharing service providers and rightholders. The Commission shall, in consultation with online content sharing service providers, rightholders, users associations and other relevant stakeholders and taking into account the results of the stakeholder dialogues, issue guidance on the application of Article 13 in particular regarding cooperation referred to in paragraph 4. When discussing the best practices, special account shall be taken, among others, of the need to balance the fundamental rights and the use of exceptions and limitations. For the purpose of this stakeholders dialogue, users associations shall have access to adequate information from online content sharing service providers on the functioning of their practices with regard to paragraph 4.

So in short, the questions you asked will have to be answered by a dialogue between the Commission, the member states, the right holders, the users and the online content sharing service providers. I think you're taking this too much as a literal law. A directive isn't a literal law. It's vague on purpose. Actual legislation will have to be based on this. 

&gt; Even ""simple"" changes like these will be detected by networks which are not fully compliant with Article 13(5) since there is no 100% success rate in classification which results in a very low rate of success on the side of the rightholders.

Every measure used must be compliant with Article 13(5). I am not sure what you're trying to say. Sure, there might be a lot of false-negatives, but as I have said before, the directive acknowledges this issue in Recital 38b. Copyright violations of some types of content will simply be unavoidable. 

&gt; Different means to avoid the availability of unauthorised copyright protected content may be appropriate and proportionate per type of content and **it is therefore not excluded that in some cases unauthorised content may only be avoided upon notification of rightholders.**

&gt; Secondly, what about licensed file formats? Someone is uploading the given png image file in a proprietary file format (this type of platform is covered by Art. 2 as long as the upload is not in terms of a cloud service, ebay, etc.). Is it cost-efficient that I am required to buy a license for these file formats if it is used on my platform just to check if the upload is legit or not?

The article explicitly puts that burden on the right-holder. Article 13(4)b:

&gt; for which the rightholders have provided  the service providers with the relevant and necessary information

&gt; In the end we can reduce it to one key element: Who would take the risk to found a platform within the EU only to become a precedent case in costly lawsuits? It will take years if not decades to have some kind of legal certainty. And then there might be a new technology which could be considered as new state-of-the-art and thus cost-efficient enough for my platform... but this has to be examined in another lawsuit against me.

Because I am not convinced the ""risk"" you are talking about exists. You act as if this law came out of no where. Variations of this directive exist in many countries, including Germany and Spain. Those are wealthy countries with sprawling internet cultures...

So knowing that fuzzy filters, as long as they make false positives, cannot be used, it seems you argument boils down to ""the law isn't specific enough"". While indeed the law isn't very specific... well... nor are directives usually. 

A directive is just a guideline (in fact in some languages it literally translates to guideline) on what memberstates should do. To quote wikipedia:

&gt; A directive is a legal act of the European Union which requires member states to achieve a particular result without dictating the means of achieving that result. It can be distinguished from regulations, which are self-executing and do not require any implementing measures. Directives normally leave member states with a certain amount of leeway as to the exact rules to be adopted.

So while yes, there will be uncertainty for the member states regarding whether they have complied with the law, businesses won't have to follow the directive. They will have to follow member state law, which will be more specific. Member states which fail to implement the directive in a business-competitive way might indeed see their business flee to other EU countries. 

But don't forget. This directive actually requires the Commission, member states, OCSSPs, right holders and users to set up guidelines on what methods should be used to conform to the directive. 

Directives are vague. There is not really much we can do about that. Being very specific would be seen as a breach on member state sovereignty, as it wouldn't leave much leeway to the member states. In fact, it is illegal for the EU to use a very specific regulation when it cannot prove that whatever it wanted to do couldn't have been done with a more broad, vague, directive.

2710,"A bit more context:

&gt;Asked by media outlet Idea if a Muslim could lead the party and become chancellor in 2030, Ralph Brinkhaus said: 

&gt;""Why not, if they're a good politician, and they represent our values and our political views?""

Now, given that he is talking about a theoretical candidate of his party  - the *Christian* Democratic Union - this seems a bit weird but I think at least a general sense, for Germany and its parties en large, that statement should be entirely un-controversial.

 But I think even for the CDU that shouldn't necessarily be controversial depending on how literal you see the ""Christian"" bit in its title or whether you think the party has a certain set of values which *not necessarily* requires somebody to be a christian to embody and represent them as candidate for and as chancellor - economic policy is generally (and definitely not here) tied to a specific religion and neither is necessarily social conservatism. Hell, even if you see strong support for a christian life as key to the party platform (which I'd argue its not), a more realpolitik view on the *representative* nature of a party leader and chancellor might very well include having those christian values advocated for by somebody who themselves does not share them but feels - through their election and party allegience - a strong responsibility to them.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/ayeu8e/a_muslim_as_german_chancellor_cdu_leader_slammed/ei0nbji/,Bekoni,1551988635

2744,"The difference is that more goods and services are available to you. Increase in standards of living comes with the increase of economic output, i.e. the production and supply of goods and services in the economy. Generally, increase of production and productivity should lower the prices. Incerase in the supply of certain goods and services would lower their cost. However there are other factors that could influence the cost, such as land scarcity would drive up the cost of housing and buildings, thus drive up the rent. Permits also impose costs on building housing and buildings thus lower the supply and raise the costs. Permits and licenses in other sectors of the economy has the same effect. Tariffs also artifically raises the costs. Bureaucratic requirements also impose costs. Administrative procedures increase the transaction cost. Subsidies also impose costs and raise the price. There can be many other factors. High standards of living comes from high productivity, high levels of production and savings. High standards of living means you can afford a lot of goods and services with the wage you receive. 

For example in Japan people pay 4 times more for agricultural products than the world price because of tariffs on imports. Americans pay several times higher price for sugar because of tariffs on the importation of sugar. Subsidizing industries also means artifically maintaining high costs. High taxation is another factor that influences prices to go up.

2771,"&gt; I think it's useful to distinguish literal filters from fuzzy filters. 

I really like this idea ;).

&gt;However, **these is no requirement in Article 13 to use these \[fuzzy filters\].** Article 13 only requires the filtering of known content. **It doesn't require companies to make judgement about new content.**

There are some problems with this point in terms of literal filters... when I have the need to ""disable access to the notified works **and subject matters**"" (Art. 13(4)c) this has to include uploads which can not be identified via literal filters\*. Think of an image which is stored as a losless png in your lookup database. Someone succeeds in uploading this file, you are warned by the rightholder and you are removing it from the platform. Now another user is uploading the png as a jpeg after a lossy conversion/compression. The jpeg won't have the same pixels as the png but it is still copyright protected by the original rightholder and -this is important- based on the directive it is not clear whether this is allowed as long as more complex filters are not able to be compliant with Art. 13(5). 

There simply is no clear wording and a severe lack of technical knowledge in the directive which will lead to massive legal and thus financial uncertainty for platform companies in the EU. Concerning my example: The rightholder could argue based on Art. 13(4) that I have not worked ""in accordance with high industry standards of professional diligence"" since the lossy jpeg conversion could have been detected with modern technology.

&gt;We are hosting a Kialo discussion.

I will look into it later ;).

&amp;#x200B;

\*Other example which is might require advanced filters that will be non-compliant with Art. 13(5):

Art. 13(4)b: ""ensure the **unavailability of specific works and other subject matter** for which the rightholders have provided the service providers with the relevant and necessary information""",,/r/europe/comments/ayd7mt/hi_reddit_im_julia_reda_an_mep_for_the_pirate/ei0oky3/,Heringsalat100,1551989450

If such a youtuber has 30 million subscribers is it a part of my best efforts to negotiate a license agreement with him? What about small publishers? What about small content creators? This point is extremely legally uncertain for me.

Oh, I do agree with this criticism. It's up to the member states to define what a best-effort is. That could be really good for some people, but really bad for others. In general though, and over time, member states will try to fight to get the most ""easy"" best-effort requirement. Member states which are unreasonable will see their online content sharing providers leave to other EU countries with easier requirements. So while I think the wording is unfortunate here, I do think it'll work out in the end.

&gt; Now I want to comply with Article 13(4)b. As a small platform I am not able to save all copyright protected materials as a blueprint to be compliant with this part. In the end I will have to use services of other companies with massive financial resources to be able to save these licensed/copyright protected works.


I don't see why this is a problem. Small platforms already outsource their basic web-hosting for instance, to absolute giants like Amazon. 

&gt; As a result of this part I will have to add these rightholders' works to some kind of a blacklist of the commercial service I am using to check them up and search for them. Let us assume that someone tries to upload content, e.g. an image, on my platform. What will happen? With a license/whitelist for these works everything would be fine. But I have to decide whether or not this is the case. There has to be service which is able to show my ""best efforts to prevent their future uploads in accordance with paragraph (b)"" which will result in the use of a commercial upload filter.

Article 13(4)c only applies when 

1. A violating work was made available on your service.
2. The right-holder made a substantiated notice where they ask you to remove said content.

When these requirements are met, you are expected to:

1. Take offline the violating content.
2. Make a best effort in preventing their future uploads.

So it's quite clear where this blacklist will come from. You just remember which takedown notices you have received. 

&gt; The intention of Article 13(5) is good but it is unrealistic that I would take the risk to let someone upload an image which might not fall into the given categories like parody (e.g. a meme), so I will block them (e.g. via raising the detection threshold in my upload filter service) to avoid costly lawsuits since the ""best efforts"" are not defined exactly.

I'm not sure how you can draw this conclusion. Article 13(5) prohibits any system that would block legitimate content. If you think fuzzy filters cannot distinguish parody from copyright violations, those fuzzy filters are banned by Article 13(5). ""Best-effort"" indeed isn't defined exactly, but this phrasing is also not used in 13(5). 13(5) unambiguously bans any system which takes offline legitimate content. No ""good-faith"" or ""best-effort"". Just a solid ban.

&gt; Not even mentioning the fact that even lawyers are not sure about these categorisations... and when there is a slight chance that I have to fight at the court including massive financial risks I won't allow uploads with lower thresholds even if they could have been legal.

I'm not sure how you come to this conclusion, but I think it'll become clearer when the previous disagreements are resolved. ",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/ayd7mt/hi_reddit_im_julia_reda_an_mep_for_the_pirate/ei0cp8c/,JBinero,1551981700

2886,"&gt;    Browder files criminal complaint against Swedbank
&gt;     
&gt;    Biggest bank in Baltics dragged further into money laundering scandal
&gt;     
&gt;    Richard Milne, Nordic and Baltic Correspondent 10 HOURS AGO
&gt;     
&gt;     
&gt;    Bill Browder, the investor turned exposer of alleged money laundering, has filed a criminal complaint against Swedbank, dragging the largest bank in the Baltics further into a dirty money scandal.
&gt;     
&gt;    The complaint to Swedish prosecutors and economic crime investigators alleges that the Stockholm-based bank handled $176m connected to an alleged Russian tax fraud uncovered by his former accountant Sergei Magnitsky, who was beaten to death in a Moscow prison in 2009.
&gt;     
&gt;    Mr Browder, chief executive of Hermitage Capital Management and a prominent critic of the Kremlin, has also filed multiple criminal complaints on money laundering against Danske Bank and Nordea, the largest Nordic bank. Several of them have been turned down by prosecutors, often due to the alleged crimes taking place too long ago.
&gt;     
&gt;    Swedbank has been sucked deeper into a growing money laundering scandal involving Nordic banks in the Baltic region in recent weeks. A Swedish TV programme last month alleged that it handled $5.8bn of suspicious transactions from Danske.
&gt;     
&gt;    Swedbank, whose shares fell by 20 per cent after the allegations, has said that it has reported all suspicious activity to authorities. But its chief executive Birgitte Bonnesen, under pressure for her handling of the affair and her communication style, conceded to analysts that there was ‚Äúa risk‚Äù that suspect payments could have slipped through the bank‚Äôs systems.
&gt;     
&gt; The bank is already under investigation by Swedish prosecutors over whether it broke insider information rules after a local newspaper said it had warned its largest shareholders about the TV programme two days before it aired.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Browder‚Äôs complaint alleges that $176m flowed from the failed Lithuanian bank Ukio and Danske to Swedbank accounts, primarily in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania but also in Sweden. He further claimed that the pattern of money flows was similar to that in his criminal complaint filed against Nordea and urged Swedish authorities to conduct a joint international investigation.
&gt;     
&gt; A Swedbank spokesperson said: ‚ÄúWe have, as far as we know, not yet been able to see the notification‚Äôs content or details. Therefore we have difficulty in giving a comment on this. In all of the cases when authorities start investigations, we always co-operate fully, and we see positively on all investigations.‚Äù

2897,"&gt; I don't subscribe to the ""upload filters will take offline everything"" narrative. I'm more on the side of the ""upload filters will further existing monopolies"" one.

Sure, although take notice of article 13(4a). The meaning of ""best effort"" relies on the size of the platform, and the cost of certain initiatives to the platform. Smaller platforms will have less expectations. 

&gt; I fundamentally disagree that platforms need to make best efforts to license content, unless that condition is satisfied by offering a blanket 10% ad revenue agreement or similar, rather worthless ones. I presume that in the end, ""best efforst"" will mean that platforms have to come to an agreement with major rights-holders, hereby tilting the negotiation power vastly in their favor. If platforms don't want to license something, they should have the right not to do so.

Sure, although I believe it's more nuanced than you make it out to be.

&gt; I don't see how it is an argument for article 13 that member states will have to interpret it themselves to make laws regarding their countries. With the vague wording, it will be incredibly difficult to figure out how to conform to those laws in each specific country, introducing even more bureaucracy. If anything, a strict interpretation of article 13 by one or more member states might just lead to the first narrative mentioned in 1. coming true, although I personally doubt that'll happen.

Online content sharing providers don't have to follow Article 13. They don't have to read the wording. They have to comply with the actual legislation member states implement. Article 13 is a law that applies to member states. The only time when companies will be subject to Article 13 is when member states have (illegally) failed to implement it themselves, at which point Article 13 will start applying until the member state complies.

But sure, I do dislike that article 13(4a)a is so vague, but sadly that's just what happens when a lot of member states disagree. This allows all of them to do their own thing. 

&gt; Regarding the first point about exceptions: The exceptions that are granted to platforms are so broad, they become the norm. You could summarize them as: Unless a platform willingly lets content that infringes on the property of others stay on, they will not be held liable. Platforms should never be liable for user-content unless they don't remove it upon notice. The burden article 13 places on platforms is unreasonably high, it promotes existing monopolies who don't have such a hard time conforming with 13, thereby stifling competition.

What burden? The only extra provisions are that:

- They must make a best effort to conduct licensing agreements with rightholders.
- They can now be notified not just of violating content they already publish, but they can be notified pre-emptively.
- They must be able to explain how they are fighting copyright violations.
- They must implement an appeal system for when they do actually take offline a legitimate work. This system will be subject to human review. 
- They shall be able to explain to users why their content was removed.

A bit off topic: I think it is time for a general re-work of copyright law. I fully agree that copyright is an important incentive for creative works, but the validity period and the criteria is - imo - ridiculous. 80 years after the death of the author: This means, usually the grandchildren are still getting alimented, and the duration of the alimentation depends on how long the author was kept alive after creating his last work. There is a financial incentive to keep old, sick and suffering creators on the brink of life to extent the revenue of the grandchildren. In my opinion it would make much more sense to tie the copyright validity to the release date, and to limit it to e.g. 30 years.

3233,"&gt;That is very special of them. The rest of us just assumes that our fraction of the total amount of taxes, is spread out among all the costs...

I pay ‚Ç¨2350 a year on car tax, this is due to carbon emissions. I do not have a problem with the price but I have a problem with [what it is spent on](https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/motor-tax-cash-used-to-fund-irish-water-30968852.html) - because it is not spent on offsetting my emissions or maintaing the transport infrastructure.

&gt;So you do think that we should require people to clean up their own mess?

Vicariously sure. But someones carbon footprint might not be their fault, people in the poverty line sometimes dont have a lot of choice.

&gt;In that case could you explain how you believe that can be achieved without taxing fossil fuel?

I would recommend taxing fossil fuel, but the current markup of my fossil fuel is already highly taxed. 63.9% of my petrol and 56.6% of diesel is just pure tax. I am not in favour of increasing this without a reduction in other taxes.

&gt;Fossil fuel does not make less of a mess depending on where you live. So how is this relevant to whether or not people should clean up there own mess?

Very utilitarian and narrowminded view. You can't just take rules that are ok in one country and apply them to another without consideration. Read the other comments, not everyone lives in a city with a train.

Some places are more reliant on it and a blanket tax can destroy that economy. People who live remote - who live on islands, who live in places without the infrastructure you enjoy.

Agriculture also has reduced tax, something that exists to sustain us. The farmer needs that tax break in order to make food for us - in turn we pay taxes to make up for it, that is fine but I do not expect the farmer to ""clean up his own mess"", but as a group (country) we can clean it up.

I do not expect someone scraping an income to clean up their own carbon footprint. We can have all the welfare benefits in the country to help them but taxing their goods instead of their income (VAT, fuel tax) will keep them poverty stricken.

3250,"&gt; mothers who say their children, aged between four and 11, should not be receiving lessons which are out of step with their religious culture.

Children aren't parents property. They should not have right to say ""my child should not learn this"". This is why I'm against private schools running on private curriculum or locally decided curriculum. The right to learn is the students, childs. It isn't parents right to have their kid educated. It is the child right to be educated. Thus parents have no veto on what the child learns or doesn't learn. Sex ed, kid gets taught, want the parents or not. Democratic principles, get taught. Freedom of religion and overview of world religions, gets taught, even against parents wishes. Equality principles, get taught. Individual rights and freedoms regarding relations with other people get taught.

&amp;#x200B;

You decide what a basic citizen should know. Then you teach it. No buts or ifs. Should the parents want to give more religious ecudation. They are free to do so outside school time. The religious teaching and school teaching clash? Too bad, parents don't get to choose facts.

&amp;#x200B;

Should the parents bar the child from school? have Constanples in the morning escort the child to school and call child welfare. The right to learn is childs right, not the parents right to have a cosy daycare for the kid that just does whatever the parents want.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course it doesn't mean absolutely anything gets taught. It means that in wide consensus and consultation education and civic specialists a good overall curriculum matching each age is constructed for all children. As said nothing stops parents from telling more stuff on their own, they just don't get to censure what the schools teaches.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention the fact that last night wasn't an example in the slightest. To call it a clear example is hilarious. You didn't provide any argument against the reasoning of why it is a penalty. Because you can't, in the rules of the game it is unarguably a penalty. 

&gt; More difficult to score than miss 

Well that's wrong. It's more difficult to miss than score obviously, hence why bookies odds for penalties are nearly always 4/1 for a miss and close to no profit for scoring. 

&gt; It was a laughable performance 

Played as well as mbappe did to be honest, dragged his team through to the next round. It's quite funny that you're bringing up amateur mistakes give that those are the reason why PSG are done in the only meaningful competition they're in this season.

3279,"Tesla is a meme and their cars are over-priced crap. The only thing that is really remarkable is their battery technology.

The company that is going to revolutionise the car industry will be the company that makes agricultural and logistics vehicles that don't look and perform like shit. Tesla made a lorry and it was uneconomical and unergonomic garbage with a paltry range of a few hundred miles when loaded.

Farmers and truckies need to be able to repair their own vehicles, so electric vehicles aren't going to go anywhere when companies like Tesla and John Deere are so autistic about their IP that everything is controlled by software that's locked down by the strictest DRM that could possibly be devised. 

If Musk really wants to revolutionise the world then he needs to realise that not every design needs to look like it's from the Jetsons and it definitely doesn't need all sorts of stupid bells and whistles that only break down. The company that makes a perfectly ordinary vehicle with an electric engine and no other nonsense and can sell that at an affordable price will be the company that is building the green car industry, and at the moment all the manufacturers are trying to throw in so much crap that it seems like the price they're charging is almost worth it and it feels like you're driving a fucking spaceship.

The 5th estate is a crock now. Zero accountability. And apparently the White House can move unilaterally. The precedent has been set, the outcome is divisive and bleak.

3362,"I‚Äôm Turkish and I kinda agree with that. Two parts of Turkey has a big enough difference that it can be compared to Hong Kong and mainland China. Northwestern, Western, Southern and West-Central are fairly liberal while Eastern, Central-eastern and Southeastern are pretty conservative. 

There are three things that I want to talk about though. First of all, ‚Äúconservative‚Äù Muslims in Turkey are not the the thing that first comes to your mind when I say that phrase. They are not violent or dangerous but just extremely closed-minded. They resemble the fundamentalist republicans in America far more than Muslims in other Muslim-majority countries. 

Second, Eastern Turkey is rapidly changing. I lived there for 10 years. I am not from Eastern Turkey per se but I still lived in the capital of Turkish conservativeness and I can safely say that the newer generations are far, far more liberal.

There are exceptions to the statements I made and I am aware that Southern-East Turkey is an exception as a whole though. 

On top of that, I think people should conder the things that gave Erdogan the power. Most people are not choosing Erdogan just because he's religious, some do but majority don't. Turkish people have voted for the most anti-Islamic leaders in the past too. The thing is, most of the uneducated people choose who to vote based on things that are tangible because wrapping your head around the intangible like culture or international politics requires not only an adequate education but a high-level education.

  
Erdogan did really improve infrastructure problems in some cities, healthcare and provided effective but short-term solutions for those tangible problems. People do not understand the damage he is doing to long-term future of Turkey, education and Turkish culture etc. from their point of view, solving problems like bad roads is a sign of 100% great government.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that, Erdogan is far more Islamic and conservative than even your average Eastern-Turk but there is a reason for that. Turkey literally banned Islam in past. If you had any Islamic attire on you, you could not enter any government-funded places (and most non-governmental places). I lived in the conservative capital of Turkey when I was a child and my teacher scolded me because I tried cover my hair within the school. I am male and the ""covering hair"" thing was wearing a beanie because it was too cold, and this happened in a city that was notorious for its conservativeness. Erdogan is a backlash against this. 

&amp;#x200B;

People assumed if a pro-Muslim prime president gets elected, maybe things would be different, maybe economy would be better etc. So they elected him. People also assumed that a religious person could not be corrupted.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing Erdogan has permanently damaged is actually the future of Islam. During his presidency, the backlash has died off. Even the most pro-Erdogan people are aware he's corrupt at this point, so the ""the religious can't be corrupted"" mentality has been abolished. Also Syrian immigrants are currently frowned upon (I do not, and I don't agree with this racist view I am just transferring the information here) by Turks, especially conservatives and they are associated with Islamic and Middle Eastern culture.

&amp;#x200B;

People don't realize this but irreligiously is on a huge rise here. It's just people are not commenting on their religious beliefs to escape oppression but it's still happening. Religious schools around my house have been doing so poorly that the administrations are renting the buildings because no one is attending them. Mosques have been getting much less crowded and I see a huge amount of Christian missionaries like Mormons and JWs in especially Istanbul. There are literally cultish people in universities that will befriend you, isolate you from rest of your social circle and impose Christianity on you slowly. (I am also irreligious but if you understood  the undertones, you probably know that I am not condoning missionaries either) 

&amp;#x200B;

This might seem like a conspiracy theory but I actually believe that the reason why Mormons, JWs and Turkish-Christian ads on web has increased significantly is because they are aware of the hidden religious vacuum happening in Turkey and want to use that for their religious-political agenda.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** There *are* two Turkeys but Eastern-Turkey is rapidly changing and the route Turkish population is taking might be completely different than the one you think it is because it is swept under the rug by the oppressive government. Erdogan is not elected solely because of religion and there are different mechanics behind his presidency.",,/r/europe/comments/axxr9n/turkey_cannot_become_an_eu_member_says_epps_weber/ehzcopz/,XIVTemperance_,1551946648

The Netherlands is one of the most densely populated countries in the world and we have one of the most utilized, most dense national rail networks in the world.

3378,"I wouldn't say these are the defining traits of classical fascism compared to involving masses in revolutionary social movement. Besides, this is really vague, is USA a fascist state for example? It's military-industrial complex is merged with state, there is mass propaganda of its army capabilities, children pledge their loyalty to the state in schools and so on. I'd say most countries in the world have some 'fascist' traits by the necessity of maintaining military capabilities and internal security. I like to imagine it as a sort of dial of state power which governments adjust as necessary, so something like Monaco is '0.01% fascist' because it's a quiet tax haven, Denmark is '1% fascist' with its Royal Danish Army, and so on. Only fascist is a dirty word after WW2, so I'd rather drop this loaded term altogether and just call it state power.

I think in general there is an overestimation of 'state power' of Russia in the West as the general ideology of the current government is just regular social-conservatism. State propaganda is on the down low compared to 2014-2015. On TV they mostly talk about social projects in poor regions, not about military stuff.

3492,"&gt;My taxes went to bailing out private companies and failing government projects.

That is very special of them. The rest of us just assumes that our fraction of the total amount of taxes, is spread out among all the costs...

&gt;And the question you ask is a leading question. I don't think that at all.

So you do think that we should require people to clean up their own mess?

In that case could you explain how you believe that can be achieved without taxing fossil fuel? 

&gt;Your plan however is mainland centric, 

Fossil fuel does not make less of a mess depending on where you live. So how is this relevant to whether or not people should clean up there own mess?

&gt; our countries should govern our tax, not the EU.

Normally I would agree, but with regard to a fossil fuel tax, the bigger the area that have same tax the less impact it will have on free market conditions. If one country puts a tax on fossil fuel, it will be cheaper to produce stuff in the country next to it and so on.  

From this it followed that it would be best if it was a world tax, but a uniform EU tax would be big enough to mitigate the impact as it is big enough to successfully put a something akin to a tariff on imports that is contingent to their lack of fossil fuel tax.

How such revenue was spent could naturally be up to the individual countries as some counties would need to spend more to mitigate the impact of a fossil fuel tax on low income households.",,/r/europe/comments/axwb7f/the_eu_should_make_train_travel_in_the_european/ehz940r/,ArandomDane,1551941569

3514,"How did they cripple it? They only annexed or occupied small pieces, certainly not occupying the whole of it and annexing large regions. The Germans still kept a professional army of highly trained soldiers that became the base of their officers in the later conflict, and the furthest extent of French occupation (over a small part of the country) was because Germany was sending over the coal it had promised to send as reparations (which it had agreed to send in place of the money it had previously refused to send). Even when America began paying Germany to send coal to France and got the French to leave the Germans still wouldn‚Äôt do it. Every few years the Germans got an adjustment to what they had to pay that made it less onerous for Germany (and less helpful for getting affected areas of France and Belgium to not be such a moonscape), and America offered all sorts of loans for very low interest rates (which the inflation on the dollar made even more toothless) that Germany used to build up an even more powerful steel industry and one of the richest societies in Europe, after it had already been hardly scathed by the war relative to the likes of France. After the Great Depression started the Allies came to an agreement for a moratorium on German payments and then cancelled it altogether after Germany had paid only a fraction of the lowered sum it was supposed to, which was less than that it demanded from France in 1870.

3580,"I'm not entirely sure I got the actual way this ""technology"" is going to make geothermal mainstream from this article. Best I could see was this: 
&gt; The term ‚Äúgeothermal‚Äù refers to drawing heat from underneath the Earth. But Climeon‚Äôs units can use heat from other sources, too. For example, the units have been deployed in steel factories, where water used for cooling hot metal is otherwise cooled and discarded. At about 90¬∞C (194¬∞F), however, it is hot enough to power Climeon‚Äôs technology.

So.... ~~geo~~thermal energy? Maybe not a bad idea, but I'm skeptical given the history of ""green"" technology ideas like [solar roadways](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-roadways-are-expensive-and-inefficient#gs.GQQN2QZ9) which got millions of dollars, and the article doesn't give much in the way of concrete detail. The best I see in it is this:

&gt;BEV‚Äôs investment criteria is that a technology, when scaled up, should be capable of cutting as much as 500 million metric tons of greenhouse gases annually. Between low-temperature geothermal and waste heat, Climeon is filling a new niche in carbon-free electricity generation that didn‚Äôt exist a decade ago, and which seems to have significant potential in improving the chances of success in the global race to zero emissions.

The last part sounds like pure marketing.

3634,"&gt;You should be. I am.  
&gt;  
&gt;Leaders don't have to be insane to do monumentally bad decisions. Wars don't need congressional approval. US Presidents are also extremely powerful compare to other democracies.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also, this is Saudi Arabia. What you're describing is wishful thinking. ""They wouldn't do that, they wouldn't be stupid enough"". Trump declared a trade war on almost all the world's democracies, among other stupid measures. The US authorized Saudi Arabia to build reactors already! They're Why even do that?! EDIT: Yeah, Iran had a problem for even trying to create nuclear power, because it's a step for nuclear weapons! Why would anyone think giving a theocracy  
&gt;  
&gt;I would say he is stupid enough to do that!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We've had trade wars with other democracies for the last 200 years. It's a mini-trade war, who cares. I wanted a trade with Europe and Canada because I'm pissed at trade restrictions and not happy with the existing trade tariffs and restrictions, especially on US food exports. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yeah. The US invaded both Iraq and  Afghanistan. Also, the Afghan government is powerless. They'll collapse  as soon as the US leaves, and the US would have invested trillions of  dollars, for what?  
&gt;  
&gt;I'll skip to your  final point to be coherent, but pulling out of Iraq didn't get the US  out of the middle east. The collapse of the Iraqi government and it's  consequences haunts the world still, with ISIS.  
&gt;  
&gt;The US is now trying to negotiate a ceasefire with the US, which is more a withdrawal than anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh no, the Afghan government is not powerless. I just disagree with that. There's no chance of the Taliban coming back. 

&amp;#x200B;

ISIS is defeated, the US isn't negotiating an ceasefire with ISIS. They only have a few dozen fighters left in like on square mile of territory. I have no idea what you're referring to. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Is it? And if the Afghans do say they'll hate you, will the US have the same about face as you did towards Iran?  
&gt;  
&gt;You  are also speaking about a Pashtuns vs Persian speakers ethnic problem,  which is going to undermine any government that forms. It's the same  Shia vs Sunni problem that undermined Iraq.  
&gt;  
&gt;Afghanistan is also one of the longest wars in US history, and yet the rural areas remain outside of control.

&amp;#x200B;

The Afghanistan war is a non-war. It's a low level insurgency at this point because Taliban arms and fighters keep on enterring from Pakistan. It's Pakistan that is the problem. We can sustain the current war in Afghanistan for eternity because we don't even have that many troops there anymore. We have only 7,000 troops there, and the Taliban is not at all ever going to come to power. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only reason we invaded Afghanistan was ***because of 9/11***. We didn't even want to go there before that. We demanded that the Taliban give us Bin Laden, when they refused, we invaded. Then once we were there we had to help setup the country. It's been a fantastic success compared to what it was under the Taliban. Girls are going to school, hospitals are built, people vote in elections. What's the problem here?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Afghanistan is also called the graveyard of  empires for the financial ruin they cause. The Soviet Union 'only' lost  14,453 men. The Byzantine Empire fell a century after the fourth  crusade. Empires don't die quick deaths, they only slowly contract.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  US before Iraq and Afghanistan was the undisputed superpower, at the  height of it's military and soft power. It's still powerful, but it's  definitely not in a good a position as before now.  
&gt;  
&gt;Those wars can't just be shrugged off.

&amp;#x200B;

I shrug it off because ***we barely spend any money there anymore***. The Soviets were fighting any actual war, we're just drone striking a few Taliban in Southern Afghanistan that are entering from Pakistan. And we have way more money than the Soviets ever did. It's not even comparable. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Having a nation of people who will hate you  and whom you only count on them being too broken to use a nuclear bomb  you is reckless. Especially when some of them can be quite educated, and  aren't just goat herders.  
&gt;  
&gt;If some of  them commit a terrorist attack to the level of 9/11... Well, not to be  callous, but I hope 'they hate us because of our freedom' won't be used  again. (Not to say any innocent people ever deserve the horror of a  terrorist attack)  
&gt;  
&gt;Anyway, it's 2 in the morning where I am, so I'll go to sleep. Goodnight, we can continue tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It's not reckless because the Supreme Leader of Iran is going to hate us anyway, so we don't care because we have nothing to lose. There are plenty of smart and educated people in Iran, and they are against the Supreme Leader too. They don't like living in a theocratic dictatorship, and we're not going to allow their dictators to get nukes.

&gt;2 - If the insult or defamation is done through publicly spoken words, written publication or drawing, or through any tecnical mean of communication with the public, the agent is punished with prison sentence between 6 months and 3 years, or with fine no lesser than 60 days.

3714,"&gt; Local train services tend to be subsidized but as half the transport to airports are foreign tourists it's seen as ok to make a profit.

As an American, the two bits of public transport infrastructure I can be proud of in comparison to almost anything in almost anywhere in Europe are our two airport rail connections, a 24 hour one that takes ~45 minutes from city center to O'Hare International, for $5, and the other to our second airport Midway International, for $2.50 that runs 20 hours a day. No transfers. No nonsense, just a straight trip to the airport. 

I've been to a lot of cities around the world with public transport 1000 times better than ours, but very few come close to how easy it is to get to the airport without paying a shitload of money for a taxi or having to transfer to two different rail lines, or a stinkin bus (lookin at you Berlin).

3718,"I've taken time to think about it, on what I agreed and disagreed with.
What was baseless corruption theory and what was a true, founded grievance.

&gt;Anti-corruption.

My point was here:
&gt;

What supports this thesis is the coincidence of dates: the American courts impose the fine against Alstom three days after the general shareholders' meeting, which validates General Electric's takeover of Alstom, and grants Patrick Kron a bonus of ‚Ç¨4 million. In addition, the American group had Alstom in its sights for some time. 

That some profited from it, and even if American companies are fined, there are some perverse incentives involved:

&gt;This internationalized pursuit of corruption has actually become a lucrative market for Anglo-Saxon business firms and the US administration. ""Fine money finances the staff of all the administrations involved in this anti-corruption fight,"" says journalist Jean-Michel Quatrepoint. These staff are motivated because the higher the fine, the more money they receive. It's the bounty hunter system!""

If one is the one who makes the judicial decision one has the advantage of foresight. When you ask why Siemens didn't buy it, it's like asking why those weren't engaged in Insider Trading didn't take as much advantage of a sudden crash.

&gt;‚ÄãMattis was pro-Iran sanctions. Mattis also wanted Trump to rip up the Iran deal. The Iran sanctions have nothing to do with Mattis staying or leaving. 

True, except he was a stabilizing force. Now that he's gone, who exactly is holding Trump back? John Bolton, his sycophants, his family?

&gt;We're a normal country and we hate that Pakistan has nuclear weapons. If we had our way we would be the only country with nuclear weapons. We take non-proliferation seriously. 

True, however:

&gt; tried to give them to Saudi

The House opened an inquiry into it. That seems to be beyond a mere comic book level conspiracy, isn't it, if I'm not wrong?

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-saudi-arabia-nuclear-power.html

&gt;Some Iraqi defectors told the CIA a fairy tale of Iraqi WMD plants and the Bush adminsitration bought it because they told them what they wanted the hear.

That abdicates all responsibility of the Bush Era, and pushes it from the US to the Iraqis, which I do not particularly find laudable. The Bush administration deliberately lied, nationally and internationally, and continued to maliciously lie for years.

The US started these wars. There is no face saving here.

&gt;The US is definitely NOT going to attack Iran. We might bomb Iran if they have a nuclear weapons facility all in one place. 

I was about to say something about how one would prevent the construction of nuclear weapons, seeing as sanctions were decried as 'being useless', and Iran were keeping to their end of the deal.

However, the solution is to 'bomb them'? That's the same excuse used for Syria, that there would be an air-campaign, but 'no boots on the ground'. What's the long term solution? Keep on bombing them forever?

&gt;. If the US invaded Iran then we would just be fighting a counter-insurgency for the next 50 years.

By the same strategic masterminds that started a two front war in the middle east, one in an area known as the 'graveyard of empires'.

Pardon me if the promise that it would be a stupid waste of life doesn't reassure me that the military won't ever invade.

&gt;The problem isn't even with Iran. We actually get along with the President of Iran because he's a normal guy. We just really hate the Supreme Leader and he's the one in control. Trump tore up the Iran deal because right now we are super confrontational with Iran in Syria where they are putting military installations near the border with Israel.

Enough love to sabotage the President's treaty, and discredit him, giving power to the Supreme Leader? Enough love to threaten to bomb and generally cause death, which would likely make the Iranians rally around ultra-nationalists and religious fanatics?

That love is than poison, and the US creates it's own enemies.

I agree that the US is not made of Machiavellian monsters however.

&gt;Enough love to sabotage the President's treaty, and discredit him,  giving power to the Supreme Leader? Enough love to threaten to bomb and  generally cause death, which would likely make the Iranians rally around  ultra-nationalists and religious fanatics?

The President of Iran has no power anyway. He's already discredited because he's not the leader of Iran. We don't care about him because he's a nobody. Let the Supreme Leader take power, and let Iran's economy suffer, and let Iranians blame their supreme leader for being poor. I don't care at all about Iran, they're going to hate us anyway, so let's make them poor. Iranians are already protesting their bad economy.

3825,"&gt; the subscription for digital doesn't compensate this loss right now (partly because people got ""used to"" reading online articles for free), no matter the investments made by press publishers.

I don't understand why it has to be fully compensated. We basically redefined the concept of journalism in the last decade, we changed the medium, we use screens now: computer screens, mobile screens, tv screens, all sorts of screens, we made it widely available to anyone anywhere, we also opened it to regular people, who doesn't have to own a newspaper or work at one to publish their work and they'll still get thousands of views. How could anyone possibly think that it won't bring any change to the press market?

Put everything behind the paywall, if people want to read it, they'll subscribe to it. Or let a new platform emerge, which would enable readers to access the articles from many publisher and share the income based on view counters. Just like some streaming services do. We do it for music, we do it for movies, we even do it for books (O'Reilly's Safari) - that are arguably the closest case to the one of news articles.

3859,"I do very much prefer trains as opposed to any other means of transport, even the way the are now. I‚Äôve got to say though that the difference in speed and comfort between all the trains in Europe is immense.
For example - here, in the Czech Republic, you can go by our high speed train from Prague to Ostrava (356 km) in just over 3 hours. That‚Äôs not so bad, but let‚Äôs look at France‚Äôs high speed trains. In the same amount of time, give or take a few minutes, you can go from Paris to Marseille, which is over twice the distance. The difference is night and day.
Now let‚Äôs have a look at regional trains. A few weeks back I took a trip to Slovakia. On the way there I took the high speed train and on my way back I took the EuroNight train. When I was there, however, I did use a local regional train, which was appaling. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, nothing was falling off and there weren‚Äôt any foul smells to report, but it was VERY dated. The train had three squeaky carriages with no sound insulation and uncomfortable faux leather seats which have seen the previous regime. On the other hand, in the part of Czechia where I live, the regional trains are actually quite nice. Relatively comfy seats, enough space, clean toilets, power outlets and even wi-fi. Similar regional trains run in Germany and I would assume in most of western Europe as well. The difference, again, is night and day.
The biggest problem though are the ticket prices. Some countries, Czech Republic included, have discounted fares for students and the elderly. Let‚Äôs just say that the bottle of water I buy at the station costs more than the ticket for my hour and a half long journey. Another comparison - the previously mentioned trip from Prague to Ostrava would cost me, as a student, 143 czk (5,6‚Ç¨). In Germany, however, a ticket from Berlin to Hamburg, roughly the same distance, costs 60‚Ç¨. Of course you have to factor in the average income of Germans and Czechs, though even then, still, German train fares are way more expensive.
Now, I don‚Äôt know how to solve Europe‚Äôs train related problems, but it sure needs some looking into. It would take a massive effort to change anything on such a large scale, let alone changing the whole train infrastructure of Europe, though I‚Äôm sure things can be done to better the experience of passengers. Maybe we can start with the train operators from different countries working together more closely with each other, work on synchronizing timetables, creating new, interesting connections and maybe even introduce lower fares on international journeys.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/axwb7f/the_eu_should_make_train_travel_in_the_european/ehy6rmv/,JohnyXCZ303,1551909925

3864,"Of course laws can change, that's fine, some of them definitely need to change. But you can't discuss a legal text or a discussion if your definition of key elements depends on an opinion. Something like ""publishing copyright protected works"" is strictly defined in a legal context. People might like it or not, but a photograph like it's published in a press article is copyright protected. When google displays it on news.google, that's publishing. It's just the frame of a discussion.

&gt; The image is not displayed full scale (thumbnail), and it is in the context of an article for which the image was paid (hence ""neighbouring right""). And even then the owner would be the photographer - not the publisher, why should a publisher be able to request compensation in this case?

This is why there needed an update of the whole regulation. At this point, in a lot of cases authors (journalists/photographers/...) aren't compensated for this because of a buy-out by the publisher. By introducing a neighbouring right + art. 12-14 (fair/appropriate remuneration or compensation of the creator) you give more rights to the publisher without weakening the position of the creator. In reality this means: more clicks/views outside of the publisher's platform can result in a better paycheck for the creator. I don't expect at all that it will create more economic value, but at least it gives those parties a better bargaining position against the giants (and not a weaker position). 

&gt; You cannot generally argue that the publisher - that used and licensed the image - is allowed to receive compensation. 

I know. Hence a neighbouring right for the publisher is preferable over buy-out contracts between creators and publishers.

&gt; What if the image uses a creative commons license?

That's fine. A creative commons license is a powerful license too, it acknowledges the rights of the creator in a fair way. It's not google who decides that a picture is CC, it's the photographer. That's were that decision should be.

&gt; I don't see this damaging the authors - especially the with the size of the thumbnails on reddit - but rather benefiting them, just like it benefits me

No, but that's not the point. Art. 11 or introducing this right has not that much to do with damage. A journalist or a publicist isn't damaged by sampling articles. The point is that aggregators benefit economically from the work of others. This should entitle them to have a word in that. If the work that's used is a substantial part of the original work, the compensation should be appropriate or at least they should have the right to say: ""no, we want our own exclusivity, you can't do this"" (which might be smart or stupid, but that's a different story). 

&gt; Sitting around a table and discussing seems fine, but in reality this would entail fierce legal negotiations. And we have already seen the results of this in Spain and Germany: is there any need for a repeat of this?

No, that's why there needs to be a better legal framework and everybody can benefit from a single market. The Spanish and German laws didn't balance different rights very well. Art 11, 12-14 of this directive seem to be better balanced and will certainly benefit from the EU scale of the framework. With a market where every country has different rules it's much easier for Google to play *divide and conquer*. 

&gt; his could lead to Google negotiating a deal where it is able to use it for free, but a competitor either has to pay a fee or don't use it at all.

A copyright directive can't solve that situation. Google has the power of being a giant on the market. But an equal legal field can at least open it up for competition. It definitely worked that way for european competitors vs Amazon.

3879,"I feel like a lot of this article is selling half truths, estimates and fear mongering as facts. Lets see:

&gt;At $4 trillion, Germany‚Äôs economy is a fifth the size of America‚Äôs. But Germany‚Äôs military budget isn‚Äôt a fifth of America‚Äôs military spending. It isn‚Äôt even a tenth.

Thats because american military budget is ridiculously high, the biggest in the world actually, and more than double that of second place, which is China. Such an argument does not hold much weight, especially since something like this would be true for literally every other NATO member, and because the american military is far more important to its economy and society when compared to other nations and their militaries. 

&gt; But NATO members have supposedly committed to reaching 2% by 2024

*Curios* that he doesn't mention that this is a non-binding target

&gt;Berlin says it can‚Äôt sensibly spend much more than it already plans for military forces. But German media have repeatedly documented the depressed state of readiness in those forces

Granted, the sorry state of equipment in the Bundeswehr is a legitimate point of critique, not just from other nations but also from within Germany, yet the cause of this problem is much more complex than ""Germany doesn't spend enough money"", it has much more to do with the incompetence of the ministry of defense and far too complex bureaucracy, rather than an issue of funds. Just throwing money at it won't help. Also like i said, a lot of people here are angry about this too and there are measures being taken to make that better.

&gt;Other reports have noted that only one of the country‚Äôs submarines can deploy on short notice; that most of Germany‚Äôs tanks are in a low state of readiness; and that barely a quarter of its nuclear-capable Tornado tactical aircraft are operational

Those are old numbers, and i know that at least the submarine number has changed. I'm not saying its perfect, or good even, right now, but if you're gonna use old numbers at least label them as such. Also many of the points and apparent disasters of the Bundeswehr i've seen circling around, like the entire submarine fleet being broken, were just outright wrong/overblown.

&gt;Berlin isn‚Äôt expecting a war anytime soon.

Because there won't be a large war soon. Don't get me wrong i do believe that one should always be prepared for the worst, but the author speaks like war is right around the corner. In fact a lot of this article is centered around the belief that its a fact that a war with Russia is gonna start, like, tommorow. Also readiness during peace and readiness during war are two entirely different topics especially for a country with an industry and economy as capable as Germany's.

&gt;Germany obtains about 40% of the natural gas it consumes from Russia

I'd like to see his source, because as far as i've seen 40% is the biggest estimate out there, usually its 30%-40%.  Don't sell estimates as facts.

&gt;‚ÄúThe Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is a Russian trap and Germany has fallen into it.‚Äù

Ahhh, the good ol' ""Germany is controlled by Russia"", if anything this also makes Russia dependent on Germany because it needs German imports, not to mention that only looking at gas, which only accounts for around 20%-25% of German energy consumption as far as i know, and disregarding Germany working towards building renewables is disingenuous and gives a warped view of reality.

&gt;But despite warnings from Washington [...] that Huawei equipment might be used to compromise Western security‚Äî for example by collecting sensitive information. 

Warnings that hold no ground as the americans have done and are doing exactly what they're criticizing here. I don't condone using chinese firms to build important technological infrastructure, but in many ways it was the *certain* unreliability of US tech that caused german politicians to consider the *maybe* unreliable chinese ones.

&gt;Two months ago, Berlin inexplicably decided to exclude America‚Äôs F-35 fighter from the competition to replace aging Tornado fighter bombers‚Äîeven though it is the most capable aircraft for continuing Tornado‚Äôs ‚Äúdual-key‚Äù nuclear mission

There is no reason for him to get so mad over this, and it wasn't ""inexplicable"", yet in this point the author more or less shows what he really cares about. You see his bio and disclosures are important here: 

&gt;*I have business ties of one sort or another to companies on all sides of the German fighter competition*
&gt;I focus on the strategic, economic and business implications of defense spending as the Chief Operating Officer of the non-profit Lexington Institute [...] The Lexington Institute receives funding from many of the nation‚Äôs leading defense contractors, including Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and United Technologies.

Pure coincidence of course that the guy who receives funding from and has business ties of ""*one sort or another*"" with the people he is suggesting as providers for the Bundeswehr is actively shilling them, but i'm sure he only writes in the best interest of Germany and Europe as a whole, and totally not for the companies that pay him. Also this is something this article, and many other people, do a lot, i.e. painting Germany not indulging in purely american interests as Germany actively working against everyones security, like, he doesn't know which fighter (or fighters) is going to win or what the Bundeswehr's plans are, but since the american one is out of the race, its immediately already painted as contributing to the ""decline of NATO"". If anything Germany being more committed to military research projects and its military cooperation with other nations should delight him, as just earlier he cried that Germany is ""not bearing the burden"" and only looking out for themselves.

&gt;Much of America‚Äôs military planning and expenditure revolves around being able to defend German borders in an east-west conflict

Back at it again with the unsourced claims and half-truths. American gains a huge amount from its presence in Germany and Europe, and certainly not doing it all for altruistic reasons of protecting others, and all of the military planning is probably minuscule to that which they gain.

&gt;If Berlin doesn‚Äôt start showing more concern for the risks its policies present to U.S. combatants and noncombatants in a future conflict 

The guy must really have some guts if he starts coming with lack of concern for risks that your own policies present to other nations considering how many headaches the US has given Europe with many of its militaristic, stubborn and oftentimes bloodthirsty policies, just let the US's involvement in the destabilization of the Middle East be an example of that.

&gt; it is inevitable that President Trump‚Äôs criticisms will win a growing audience on this side of the ocean

3969,"&gt;Yes, Einstein. No-one is denying there are biological differences between men and women. 

Assloads of people are denying that innate gender differences affect behaviours and preferences. It's the entire reason we're having this argument.

&gt;&gt;Females in a general sense are more likely to be interested in working directly with people and taking care of people, like doctors and nurses do. Because they are the main caretaker on a baby at the young age.

&gt;Absolute, utter bullshit. Then why were nursing and medicine considered masculine jobs until very recently?

&gt;This kind of pseudo-scientific psychological babble just serves to confirm your own biases. There is not a single scientific study backing you up.

Do you have any comment on results that showed...

*men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people, producing a large effect size (d = 0.93) on the Things-People dimension. Men showed stronger Realistic (d = 0.84) and Investigative (d = 0.26) interests, and women showed stronger Artistic (d = -0.35), Social (d = -0.68), and Conventional (d = -0.33) interests. Sex differences favoring men were also found for more specific measures of engineering (d = 1.11), science (d = 0.36), and mathematics (d = 0.34) interests.*

So the parts of my country that celebrates heathen practices celebrate Dutch culture? Even though that same practice was found all over Europe and not only Dutch lands?

&gt; The idea that a sicilian old lady, a polish dude and a dutch teenager are a part of a single common culture is stupid. 

That idea is stupid because you are obtuse and willingly spout out stupid comparisons to further your agenda, just as the examples the other person gave. But to deny there is huge cultural overlap between people over large swabs of lands is just plain moronic and agenda pushing.

The idea of a single Dutch culture is getting more and more obsolete. Even though a lot is based on old Calvinism, that was not exclusive to the Dutch. What the Sicilian, Pole and Dutch might have in common as well is Catholicism, and (un)knowingly celebrating the same things and thus having overlapping family values, burial rites etc etc. They would have less in common with the average Turk in Andara, and still more with the Calvinistic celebrations that had the same original influences. Both are part of our European culture. It is just personal willingness to see things on a micro or macro level.

Of course Europe is a mix, but to deny that one arbitrary geographical area has no common culture and another arbitrary area does is plain wrong.

Even phalanx said there is no Turkish culture, it is a mix:

&gt;Turkish culture is mostly Irano-Turkic with local elements.

4105,"Cannot speak for the French, but I think an EU reform, a more integrated EU before an expanded EU would be a good idea. It should have done before the last expansion. The national governments have a lot of power in the EU. The bigger the EU gets, the higher is the risk that a single national government vetoes decisions. It's easier to find consensus and compromise with 15 members compared to 30 members. 

So yes, I think the EU needs a reform before expansion. We should get rid of the right to veto. Some decisions are already based on qualified majority (55 % of countries need to agree which need to represent at least 65 % of citizens).

As a German, I'm not even sure what I read there. So you are seriously suggesting Nazis and Communist represent some kind of unified leftist ""socialist axis"", all on the basis of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact?

That's quite.. bold? Because it pretty much completely ignores the entire domestic Nazi side of that period. I mean, you *are* aware that the literal first victims of Nazi concentration camps were German communists Rudolf Benario, Ernst Goldmann, Arthur Kahn and Erwin Kahn, [killed in Dachau](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/KZ_Dachau#Politischer_Terror_1933%E2%80%931934)?

The Nazis used the Reichtagsbrand to round up all of their political opposition, which was pretty much all socialist and communist parties at that time and just the continuation of a ""fight against the Bolsheviks"" [the German radical-right](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibolschewistische_Liga) had been calling for since observing the November revolution in Russia.


&gt; And this literally only talking about the URSS cozy relationship with fascist states (like how fascist Italy was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with the URSS, remaining in friendly terms until 1935).

Using that same kind of proxy reaching one could argue that [the Vatican also had a ""cozy relationship"" with the URSS](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/21/vatican-secret-property-empire-mussolini), which would make this all even weirder.

It becomes particularly weird in the context of plans like [operation Unthinkable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Unthinkable), which apparently wasn't *that* unthinkable but using your logic would make the Allies proxy supporters of the Soviet Union *and* the Nazis, maybe they all of them are working for the Illuminati?

The true current cost of flying isn't in your wallet, it's in the CO2-levels in the atmosphere. If people do less flying, there's less CO2 in the atmosphere.
Also, by putting a heavy tax on airline fuel (or, even just on carbon emissions), you heavily incentivize airlines and aircraft manufacturers to find solutions and build (for instance) carbon neutral planes. 
I don't care if airlines, airports and airplane manufacturers can't operate in such a new market. On the contrary, I hope a lot of them go under.

One could debate that to a degree (because one could debate the nature and scope of NATO, but that is a totally different discussion and this ain't the place for it), but distilled down yes you can say that.

Germans, when polled, may like NATO and ""support"" it (which most likely means ""Yeah, well, okay, but don't ask me to do more than tolerate it"", kinda like our attitude towards our own military) but they don't know details and often don't want to know. I bet if someone in political Berlin would point out the contradictory nature of a lot of public attitudes here, towards NATO and security issues per se, then I would bet approval would go down rather quickly.

The problem with Italy was, and still is, that the government bought way too many commuter cars in the early 70s, which unfortunately still work. Therefore the country never really updated its regional train network in the last 50 years.

In the northern regions commuting by train is actually quite nice, and really cheap. You can get a monthly subscription for the entire region of Lombardy for less than 150 Euros. Try getting that in Germany.


Spain obviously has problems regarding the unconventional track gauge which has to be updated to a more useful system.

Since the Thalys tickets from cost the same as flights, we took the train.  Although the train trip is longer than the flight, we saved time and effort going to the airport early and transferring from CDG.

But, I would have never considered taking the train from Amsterdam to Valencia like I did last week.  Valencia's airport is super convenient, only a 30 minute subway ride away from the center.  And AMS is well-connected by train.  With no checked luggage, we got to the airport about 1.15 hours in advance and enjoyed a 2.5 hour direct flight. So a 4-hour ordeal altogether to get to Valencia.

At the same time, it should get funding from somewhere, either from being profitable or from government funding. 

It is a tall order to say the least.

I think having a significant government-funded portion of media would be a good idea. Clickbait and sensationalism bring a lot of profit, which is why they are so rampant. If media doesn't have to worry about selling, it can focus on what it is important and not sensationalise it. Would people follow such media? I hope so. There should still be some incentive to make high-quality stories, interesting or important and well-written, so maybe some sort of reward system for journalists? But who decides on what is high-quality? Public vote, or a government commitee? And how to make sure that it stays independent from government influence, when it is funded by the government?

More seriously, French and German interests differ a lot in many topics, and you are basically here saying like French and Germans are always getting what they want, which is a total contradiction since their interests differ a lot, so eventually they can't get always what they want by pure logic.

As for truck drivers, prove me that this is only French drivers ""wishes"". Aren't most Western Europeans also in favour of it?

As for deficit, France last year and in 2017 was respecting the 3% deficit rule under Maastrich criteria, the debt is even reducing (in 2017 for example growth for France was at 2.3%, so the total share of debt in French gdp is logically decreasing), while it's not a good situation, why not talk about the UK that is constantly in deficit since the crisis? You seem to have a weird focus on France, but clearly you should have a more comprehensive and general view of how things are handled in every European nation. 

As for deficit, one could argue that fiscal transfer (in billions!) sent by Western European countries such as Germany, France, the Netherlands, Italy or even the UK is a burden for the public debt and increasing deficit. Perhaps if bigger states that are contributing to the EU budget are allowed bigger deficit, it's precisely because they are the ones bearing all the costs...

4365,"&gt;Just look at above map. The regions in Europe which are most strongly associated with social definition of gender roles have much, much higher amount of women in research then the regions which are not. How would that under your supposition be even possible? Of course its not, but since that breaks the narrative its gonna be ignored.

It's actually very easy to explain but you of course want to ignore it. When women have choices they take the ones that don't go against the ""last bastions of men"" because that's exhausting. Also, higher definition of gender roles leads to less stress when you go against them since they actually aren't ""last bastions of men"". The gender roles exist in other ways. Also, if you need to have that money to survive you are more motivated to ignore all the crap. There's reasons, don't ignore them. 

&gt;There is also research published which studied the effects of this ""STEM is sexist and against women"" on undergrad females who enrolled in STEM course and comparing it to group of females who were not exposed to it. The drop rate in former was much higher than in later, often citing the sexual bias that was fictional. How exactly do you imagine that you can convince a young girl to take STEM path if from early childhood you will hammer into her head that she will be entering territory dominated by men who are sexists and will throw piles of logs under her feet at every step only because of her gender?

Funny how women change careers because of sexism despite it not existing, myself and several of my friends included! Wow!

&gt;And it would be actually democratic to give parents bloody choice in how they want to spend their paternity leave instead of social engineers deciding for them because they want to ""change stuff"".

Without some force nothing changes. Men have the choice of not having children if they don't feel like it. I mean women have to do that choice already and still we're affected by other women having children. 

&gt;What is I have low-paying job, but my wife is a high-level executive and thus I want to take full paternity leave? No can do under your guidance. Stroke of a genius right there.

How often does that happen? 

&gt;I like how you described working overtime hours in crunch, in order to provide for the family as ""benefit"".

It's not because of that... It's because that way they don't have to take part on the baby life. This has been the experience of several of my friends. I know several women who divorced their husbands because they got tired of being a single parent in a relationship. Several men have confessed that they'd rather be working than listen the baby cry.

Turkish-origin people in Germany are fairly well-represented throughout the layers of society, and not less of a part of the society than other large immigrant groups like the Polish, Vietnamese, Italians or the people from the Western Balkans or the Arab-speaking countries.

Radical Islamism is by no means a specifically German-Turkish problem, and to a large extent originates from Europeans with their origins in Saudi-Arabia and Egypt. 

That being said, independently of the problem with an extremist Salafist minority the Islam in Europe faces, quite a few Turkish Mosque confederations in Europe are problematic because they link Islam to the Turkish government, that is, they say that a good Muslim should support Erdoƒüan - a problem comparable to the state churches in some eastern European countries and their communities in Germany. That is a different beast, though.

The fact that people in Western Central Europe were so shocked by a lot of their Turkish-origin fellow citizens still supporting Erdoƒüan after all of his derailments really shows disappointment and puzzlement about why they would feel so much patriotism for Turkey still, despite being integrated here so well.

It does no good to oversimplify and unnecessarily confuse things with each other; Turkish state politics, the Turkish diaspora, Turkish Islam, European Islam, Muslim citizens in Europe, immigrants from Muslim-majority countries and Radical Salafism are all separate issues that of course are connected to each other, but also to a lot of other factors and all merit their own discourse.",Circle of Stars,/r/europe/comments/axv8uz/popularity_of_countries_being_allowed_into_the_eu/ehwo3r3/,amzyanti,1551866162

4485,"It's easy for you to say that, but as for myself and my family, we lived through that. Our grandparents were literally born in huts made of shit, clay and straw (cow dung dried and mixed with clay, with some straw and then thatched in straw). No healthcare, education, pension, nothing. No rights. Frequent mass epidemics and famines. 

You think USSR was 'Western world' but that's not that simple. My grandparents were in Northern Moldova, used to be Romanian territory. Their level of existence was not Western, it was that of an Indian farmer. 

What USSR did was not so simple, and Tsarist Russia showed no signs of heading that way at all. All of the established power classes had very strong vested interest in maintaining the society in very similar ways. The Russian Civil War tore the country apart into many smaller warlord states.

I am a history major, got my BA in the US. I focused on Antiquity, but for several reasons I decided to do my bachelor's thesis (unfortunately a requirement at the Uni I went to) focusing on Chinese history of the late Warlord Era and the KMT vs CCP conflict. One of the things that always struck me was how similar everything was to the history of Russia in the 1920s, except that China did not reach the state of USSR in 1920s until 1950s dawned upon China. 

If communists did not take over, the warlord era would have been a thing for Russia as well, most likely. No single power faction had enough power to take over all of the former Russian Empire. Nobody to stop resurgent Germany in the 1930s. Granted, that Germany would probably not even be Nazi necessarily. On the other hand, even a USSR led by someone other than Stalin may have faltered in WWII. 

As much as I hate Stalin, his rapid industrialisation was nothing short of a miracle, especially given how it was done in spite of the world, without outside investments that typically accompany such reform. If Trotsky took over instead, there would be less purges, but Trotsky was an expansionist. He would antagonise West even more and force them to eventually create a coalition that would destroy Russia before it even industrialised. Trotsky believed in international revolution thought of communism, not socialism in one country as Stalin did. 

&gt;Im having a hard time with people giving credits to the USSR for being equal. They werent equal. The Soviet parliament didnt have women. USSR generals were exclusively male. All USSR leaders were male. Females had better acces to higher education than in many western countries: i admit. They sent a woman to space 2 decades before the west did; true. But they were far, very far, from actual equality. Not even close.

Never said they were perfect, I literally said that it wasn't, word for word -- but I said it was *better*. USSR was consistently better than the West during decades of its existence in terms of womens' rights. Much of this was practicality - a lot of men were dead after WWII, and it makes no sense to waste half your country's potential -- particularly when women are more than half. 

What you do not see is what happened on the ground, the encouragement of women going into STEM was such that I grew up thinking that girls were just as good at boys in STEM. Only when I moved to the US did I realise that it isn't normal for women to get into maths and programming. I wrote much more detailed posts about this on this thread.

4488,"Very short summary. There were these feisty and bloodthirsty Baltic (and Finno-Ugric) tribes who lived squabbling and cooperating between themselves, as you do, and raiding across the Baltic coast (think: Vikings. the Danes had a saying: ""God save us from the plague, fire and the Curonians!""). We were all pagan, and the Balts are still known as the last pagans of Europe.

Cue the Crusades. They come in, establish Livonia (Terra Mariana) but not everyone wants to be Christian and cooperate so - war, for about a hundred years with different Baltic tribes. The whole submission thing wasn't that simple. 

Fast forward a few centuries - the Baltic Germans are our intellectual and cultural elites (also our lords/slavers but we're ok, our guys bought themselves out). All educated people speak German. Fast forward a bit more. The Baltic Germans are instrumental in the first Latvian National Awakening, encouraging the use of Latvian language, the promotion of Latvian culture etc. Very thankful but there's quite bit of resentment in this newly proud nation of Lavians towards their former oppressors. But we were ok. Fast forward to WW2. Stalin and Hitler, being the friendly pals that they were, agree to divide up Europe and before Stalin invades the Baltics, he ships off all Baltic Germans to Nazi Germany.

4494,"&gt;Quotes, memes and OC are not subject to this article.

Exactly, but they will be blocked, as it's better to block, than to be held liable for hosting copyrighted stuff. That's the entire problem we have with article 13. Overblocking is destined to happen, with how article 13 is written. 

One example:
I own a photo, and I made Reddit aware of that. Now someone puts some text over my photo, and uploads it to Reddit. It has to be filtered. But the filter has to decide, whether someone just put a watermark over my photo, or whether the text is funny. It's not possible to automate right now, so rather than letting the meme be uploaded, they will delete it.

Another Example regarding OC:
Warner Bros owns Lord of the Rings, and tells Reddit that it owns it. I travel to New Zealand, the place it was filmed, and make photos of the places it was filmed. Or I even go to the [Hobbiton] (https://www.hobbitontours.com/en/) movie set, and make some photos. It **is** OC. But depending on the picture, Reddit can't be sure whether it is copyrighted, and will rather block it, than let it through.

Or think of the photography hotspots, like the Eifel Tower, or the Tower of Pisa. I can claim copyright for a simple picture of the Eifel Tower. So can many others. Now we have 1000s of copyrighted pictures of the Eifel Tower, and Reddit has to decide whether the newly uploaded Photo is OC, or it is a slightly modified copyrighted picture.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/axo2a6/people_out_in_munich_against_article_13_keep_at_it/ehwog4a/,AnnynN,1551866795

4641,"&gt;So why didn't NATO change *accordingly*?

I think it is to a degree. At least the US military is transitioning to a great powers race. 

&gt;And how are planes, tanks and cruise missiles helpful in any meaningful way?

Because capability and resolve are a huge part of posturing. If the EU had an integrated expeditionary unit, functioning fighter planes, and it was prepared to use them in say Crimea, that changes Putin's calculus. He might not invade. It's realpolitik.

&gt;One way to update NATO's mission - and a highly urgent one at that - would be to raise our game when it comes to the cyberspace, which to this day is a dangerously underfunded side-show no one really cares about.

Sure.

&gt;The *North Atlantic Treaty Organisation* has no business in the Pacific. Sorry, that's your front line and you should look to Japan and Australia if you can't ride the dragon alone.

If espionage/cyber attacks, Huawei communications infrastructure, and control of shipping lanes aren't direct enough, then consider that the US can't fully pivot to China if we still have to handhold Euro allies. The UK and France can't even bomb across the Mediterranean without US handholding. 

&gt;How is Germany a *liability* for the alliance?

It's a mutual defense alliance. So at the onset there is a probability that one member can drag another into a war. That's the liability column. Germany contributes barely anything to the asset column. OP's link paints a dire picture. So countries like Germany are a liability.

Article 13, paragraph 1, subparagraph 2, reads:

An online content sharing service provider shall obtain an authorisation from the rightholders referred to in Article 3(1) and (2) of Directive 2001/29/EC in order to communicate or make available to the public works or other subject matter. Where no such authorisation has been obtained, the service provider shall prevent the availability on its service of those works and other subject matter, including through the application of measures referred to in paragraph 4. This subparagraph shall apply without prejudice to exceptions and limitations provided for in Union law

TLDR: Sites are not allowed to host copyrighted stuff without permission. In terms of sites like youtube, good luck getting permission for ALL the things your users upload. Hence, we turn to the further paragraphs

Article 13, paragraph 4. Reads:

In the absence of the authorisation referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, Member States shall provide that an online content sharing service provider shall not be liable for acts of communication to the public or making available to the public within the meaning of this Article when: (a) it demonstrates that it has made best efforts to prevent the availability of specific works or other subject matter by implementing effective and proportionate measures, in accordance with paragraph 5, to prevent the availability on its services of the specific works or other subject matter identified by rightholders and for which the rightholders have provided the service with relevant and necessary information for the application of these measures; and (b) upon notification by rightholders of works or other subject matter, it has acted expeditiously to remove or disable access to these works or other subject matter and it demonstrates that it has made its best efforts to prevent their future availability through the measures referred to in point (a).

TLDR: Even if they don't have permission to host copyrighted stuff, hosting sites cannot be held responsible and punished if they have made the efforts to stop copyrighted stuff from being hosted. Having a system like youtube's seems good here, but the following paragraph might cause concern:

Article 13, paragraph 5. Reads:

The measures referred to in point (a) of paragraph 4 shall be effective and proportionate, taking into account, among other factors: (a) the nature and size of the services, in particular whether they are provided by a microenterprise or a small-sized enterprise within the meaning of Title I of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC, and their audience; (b) the amount and the type of works or other subject matter uploaded by the users of the services; (c) the availability and costs of the measures as well as their effectiveness in light of technological developments in line with the industry best practice referred to in paragraph 8.

TLDR: The efforts they make must be proportional to A) the size of their service. b) the amount of stuff uploaded, c) what is economically feasible. If only a nuke is available, but the problem is a fly, they can't be punished for not using the nuke to swat the fly. This is where it might get iffy, especially combined with paragraph 7 and 8 of Article 13. Paragraph 7 is all about exceptions and limitations to copyright, while paragraph 8 mentions how a system isn't fire-and-forget, and should be replaced if something better is feasible.

‚Äã

Youtube, with its numberless controversies over it's content ID system, especially in regards to fair use, and backed by the wealth of Google, might especially dread paragraph 8, being required by law to change their system if better is feasible.

4683,"**Judgment of the Warsaw court: blocking demonstrations of nationalists ""is not socially harmful"".**

 
 
40 people who blocked the march of the National-Radical Camp and All-Polish Youth on August 15, 2017, have been acquitted today.  The District Court for Warsaw-Centre decided that hindering the demonstration of nationalists is not socially harmful.



- Blocking organisations with such achievements and history as All-Polish Youth or ONR is not a socially harmful act,"" said Judge ≈Åukasz Bili≈Ñski, justifying his decision.  Then he reminded about the pre-war activity of both ""truly patriotic"" organizations.  He talked about how the ONR postulated the deprivation of Jews of public rights, reminded that also contemporary nationalist activists said about themselves that they were ""racial separatists"".  This is why it can be justified to oppose their marches in public space.



- The principles of the rule of law cannot be reconciled with the position of the MW or ONR.  Organizations that question fundamental values such as tolerance cannot benefit from the protection resulting from the freedom of assembly,"" said Judge Bilinski.  And therefore, he argued that although activists actually blocked legal assembly, it cannot be assumed that their actions were socially harmful and undermined important values.



On August 15, 2017, activists of the liberal opposition organisation and anti-fascist activists tried to block the march of nationalists following the New World.  They were sitting on the street calling ""Warsaw free from fascism"", with white roses.  The police removed them from the road, allowing nationalists to pass, and then applied to the court to punish the participants of the blockade for obstructing or attempting to obstruct the course of an unbanned assembly.  She demanded that each activist and activist be ordered to pay a fine of several hundred zlotys.  Will she lodge an appeal against her unfavourable verdict?  The uniformed representatives present in the court did not give an unambiguous answer.



This is not the first time that the court has not imposed penalties on anti-fascists and liberal activists for blocking the marches of the extreme right.  But it is not the last such case either.  At the request of the police, the court will take care of, among others, a group of Polish citizens who blocked a demonstration in Hajn√≥wka at the end of February in honour of ""Bury"" and other ""cursed soldiers"".

One in five workers in the EU (20 %) spent most of their working time standing up, such as teachers or shop sales assistants. The remaining people employed had jobs that mostly involve heavy labour or are physically demanding, such as heavy construction work, loading and digging.

Within these EU averages, there are variations in the different Member States. For example, the majority of people employed in the Netherlands (55 %), Germany (54 %) and Luxembourg (52 %) spent their working time mostly sitting down.

As someone who knows the language of one of the countries with a high percentage, the word I would imagine they would translate ""consent"" to is, actually, far less nebulous and just a very common, basic, clearly defined word. Also, the question, unlike what the title implies is not ""was it ok"", but ""was it *justified*"", which makes this result even worse, as I can see why someone would say ""Oh, it's ok, he was just drunk"", but not ""Oh, it was *justified*, she *deserved* to be abused because the assailant was drunk"".  
  
As for the 9 situations, they are specified as (in order of how many people responded ""yes, it would be justified under these circumstances""):  
Being drunk or using drugs  
Voluntarily going home with someone, for example after a party or date  
Wearing revealing, provocative or sexy clothing  
Not clearly saying no or physically fighting back  
Flirting beforehand  
Having several sexual partners (who?)  
Being out walking alone at night  
If the assailant does not realise what they are doing  
If the assailant regrets his actions  
  
Now I can understand the drunk part and the voluntarily going home part, as the concept of assuming/not assuming intent in these blurry situations might be difficult, also the ""not clearly saying no"", as a lot of men just tend to think that a woman would just say no, instead of being intimidated, but here's the big problem: while I was too lazy to copy the percentages (I already had to type the 9 situations by hand, as they appeared in an image, not as simple copy-pastable text), but let me say just this: the percentage of people who said it was justified because the woman was walking alone at night was *seven percent* That's one of 14 Europeans.

4751,"I tried to read a little more into it and the the text says (as far as i know this doesnt have to mean shit, you can read the article yourself but its a hard read) that the webprovider (lets take youtube for example) is basicaly liable for copyrighted material.

Right now if someone would want to sue you for uploading copyrighted material on youtube you get shit on and youtube would look away (they dont, they have an ID system which would already be enough for the article 13 as far as i know). With article 13 its youtube who is getting sued instead.

All the website has to do is show intend to fight for copyrighted material.

&gt;The article directs member states to consider the size of the provider, the amount of content uploaded, and the effectiveness of the measures imposed ""in light of technological developments"". It also mandates an appeals process, and requires content hosts to share ""information on the use of content"" with its owners, the lack of which has been a point of contention in the past.

___

Article 11 is mostly about press publications. It gives automatic copyright protection to online articles of the press so you cant just copy and paste whatever you want and noone has to read the article anymore. Which would be the only way for them to make money.
___

From a logical viewpoint i can honestly see both articles being reasonable. It is honestly hard to be against article 11 since online press article copying is huge. There is a whole subreddit called /r/savedyouaclick which is all about them taking the most important information on an article and presenting it without the whole filler content. Which would probably be the only reason against it because most online articles are literal cancer. On the other hand the article 11 is only copyright protected for a year.
___

All i can say is im a little dissappointed how the internet (mostly social media) is making this out to be some kind of democracy catastrophy instead of actually talking about the article itself.

The fact that most people who ask what the article is about get the same answer ""Upload filter and Memefilter"" is somewhat concerning.

I got the information mostly from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_on_Copyright_in_the_Digital_Single_Market#Content).

""In a nutshell, France relies on Germany to cover its peak demand, not vice versa. There is, however, a risk of Germany decommissioning so much coal and nuclear capacity over the next seven years as to endanger the security of supply, but there is also enough time for the country to prevent this outcome. Right now, Germany imports nuclear power from France when the French need to dump excess nuclear generation at low prices ‚Äì not in order to prevent blackouts in Germany.""

And it is paying off.

So a pirated/unlicensed video that's uploaded 20000 times, needs to be claimed 20000 with the current law. With the new directive, it only needs to be done 1 time and then the intermediate is responsible to keep it down.

What is the difference between a site profiting by providing links to pirated content (unauthorised copyrighted content) and youtube, from a legal perspective with the current Directive in effect or the existing member state legislations? 

If a website can be taken down for offering unauthorised content, something which already has happened in member states for copyright infringement, why can't courts acts in the same way against youtube and enter into an agreement to compensate monetarily or for youtube to implement similar provisions which exist in the proposed in Article 13?",,/r/europe/comments/axn0wm/im_quentin_deschandelliers_i_work_for_mep_marc/ehvoo13/,Idontknowmuch,1551830200

Developing a contentID system of their own is prohibitively expensive, and can't realistically be done within three years after startup if you're a new media platform. Therefore, new media platforms will have to license theirs from existing media platforms.

5014,"After reading Article 11, and finding it not containing any sort of ""tax on links"" I am skeptical of the protests. Article 11 said, that publishers cannot copy content while providing a link to source, to justify the copying, but the summary and link to source are completely legal and justified. Maybe I cannot grasp the true meaning as I'm not a copyright lawyer, but the ""Link tax"" and ""death of social platforms including Reddit"" seemed to be completely invented, and there was not a single good write up how they are a real possibility.

Article 13 in a form requiring automatic content detection is bad, but putting responsibility on content-sharing platform owners to stop illegal content from appearing was more or less inevitable. YouTube was big enough and got sued enough media companies to agree to content ID. That's why I'm not into ""YouTube is literally devil"" circlejerk - it was bound to happen. On the other hand Article 13 provided important improvement, which is required ability to appeal the copyright strike - strengthening that requirement is what we should be fighting for, this is best bet to get balanced regulation, protecting small creators and individual users from corporations abusing copyright, while still making copyright work. Moreover it's a directive, so member states should introduce their own regulations, and according to the directive the law should take into account different technological and operational possibilities for platforms of different size.

I would be more than happy if that were the occasional stereotypes about us, at least it would put us on the same levels as the other Eastern European countries which are at least still viewed favourably. Romania is straight up more disliked than Russia.

Were they outside a few internet bubbles? The average Joe couldn't care less about that. There is also the fact that the protests were not even covered that much by foreign media.

You can also put some parts of Eastern Europe in there as well, it is not like we are seen much better there anyway.

A more federalized EU needs to have far greater respect for the individuality of its member states than the US has for its own if it wants to succeed.

5070,"Google provides a free service to keep people on their service and have them use their other services, like Google search, on which there is advertising. Content is always bait, nothing more.

But there's not only Google, you have other aggregators who monetise their service. You have media monitoring service that literally takes the content from news website and resell it to their client.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is that news publishers rely on 2 stream of revenues : subscription and advertising revenues. Subscription for paper is hitting rock bottom due to the change in uses (why not, time changes) and the subscription for digital doesn't compensate this loss right now (partly because people got ""used to"" reading online articles for free), no matter the investments made by press publishers. As for the advertising revenues, it got sucked out by the platforms, with aggregators who use their content without asking anything, in some case generating traffic (and therefore revenues for the publishers) but in a lot of cases people just read the snippet and move on while staying on the service and generating revenues for the platform.

So on the one side you have publishers who basically have to fire journalist and stop expansive journalism to keep their head above water. On the other, you have platforms that became the prime vector of access for information who say ""I'll use your content, but stay quiet about it"".

5126,"Hi,

In EU law, the notion of general monitoring doesn't mean that you forbid checking all the content that is uploaded on your platform. Otherwise it would be impossible for any licensing deal (for instance) to be applicable because to remunerate an author you need to be able to detect that his work was used, which is done at the time of the upload.

What it means is that you can't force a platform to do an unllimited monitoring of its content, by saying ""you have to check that every single piece of data going through you doesn't include any illegal content"".

In the context of this Directive (and the paragraph that you quote) you require a targeted duty of care. This obligation only applies to the specific content for which an author actively asked an action by providing the specific data that must match, within specified parameters. Anything that doesn't correspond to these specific works and to the specific parameters, the platform doesn't have any action to take, even if the content is illegal.

As said in recital 38b, a platform has no responsibility toward content for which authors didn't manifest themselves or didn't provide the necessary data : 

   

""\[...\] When rightholders do not provide the service providers, with the necessary and relevant information on their specific works and other subject matter or when no notification concerning the removal or disabling access to specific unauthorised works or other subject matter has been provided by rightholders and, as a result, online content sharing service providers cannot make their best efforts to avoid on their services the availability of unauthorised content in accordance with the high standard of professional diligence, the service providers should not be liable for unauthorised acts of communication to the public or of making available to the public of these unidentified works and other subject matter.\[...\]""",Copyright AMA,/r/europe/comments/axn0wm/im_quentin_deschandelliers_i_work_for_mep_marc/ehv3sef/,Qdeschandelliers,1551815977

5132,"Hi Quentin, thanks a lot for the answer. I appreciate it. Ok, so Art. 13.4(a) (""made best efforts to obtain authorisation"") means in the case of Youtube, for example, it could point to an updated ContentID.

Also, the principle of proportionality which you have highlighted multiple times has been very helpful, but it I have to say, it has not been communicated well in the preliminary analysis I saw.

I read articles by lawyers and professors who were uncertain how one would prove 13.4(a) and where platforms would get authorisation. The sort of blanket licenses you talked about make sense but the principle of proportionality (not all platforms have to use filters) is crucial. 

There was a fear that a lot of smaller platforms would have to close! For me personally, the fear was that platforms I use every day would find all this too vague or complicated and just resort to overblocking to avoid liability. 

However, I really hope we can communicate these principles of proportionality more clearly (even to the platforms themselves!) and also what would be considered ""best efforts"". 

Why is it that few other proponents of the directive have explained it as concretely and clearly as you did? It would have saved some worry. I mean, even Youtube itself and lawyers working on the topic seem to have open questions about this. 

Anyway, thanks a lot for answering the questions and we really need to get some of these things communicated more clearly, so that people don't freak out!

The success of Danish farm exports rests mostly on animals, like bacon and butter, and of course our industries are originally built on the success of farming inferior farmland compared to what most of Europe has.

Also, ethnic cleansing is generally a planned act of mass murder, neither the Poles, Czechs, Romanians nor Soviets planned to mass murder ethnic Germans, Poland wanted to re-polonise them (and many were, successfully), however the  majority fled before the Soviet Forces and died from famine or suicide. They were generally not murdered but rather died due to poor supply of food, water or out of fear (again, suicide).

Also, none of the mentioned countries ran camps for ethnic Germans, Poland/SU held a single internment camp for ethnic German Nazi collaborators in Silesia, but only 5,000 people died there, and mostly under Soviet administration.

The Federal Archive states that out of 3,000,000 German refugees, over 1,000,000 were re-polonised in Poland alone. That‚Äôs a huge amount, that‚Äôs more than a third.

Because non-profits by definition don't profit.

Only in certain circumstances, and then only a list that is limitatively defined to a few specific examples of non-profit *organizations* with particular goals, not even individuals. It's added as an exception, not a pillar of the whole directive.

The other half of the problem is that everyone will still be guilty of copyright infringement until proven innocent - this gives a huge advantage to copyright owners.

That is bullshit peddled by the lazy, unimaginative employers who never really wanted to invest in the employees in the first place. I've never liked them and their neoliberal (neoconservative) ideology anyways.  
They have always had money for a new car and never for the employees; trying to cheat a person out of money for the retirement was use to very common. They deserve to feel the pressure from Macron. I don't pity them.  
You and them want the anti market measures to be introduced and not Macron.  
Because the single market is not for employers/companies, it is not for them to sell slave work. The single market is also for the employees.  
And the employees have every right to chose a better paying employer in another EU countries, because they are not fucking slaves. And the companies/employers should should be forced to compete for employees just like Macron wants force them.  
If they can't compete for workers, fuck them (they won't care about me when they will fire me, why should I care about them), I don't owe them anything, I will chose a better company in another EU country.

5464,"&gt;such protections are vital pillars of the entertainment industry or similar industries. 

It seems this isn't the case. So indeed what we've had is a big enforcement issue. Yet that didn't seem to have hurt the industry at all:

https://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/

Content creators have been creating content. Content consumers have been paying for their content even though that content can also easily be obtained illegally. It appears we currently have a nice balance where those who can afford to pay for the content are doing so and those who can't are still able to enjoy the content as well.

We should perhaps just scrap copyrights entirely.

Article 13 is indeed about finding ways to tackle the enforcement issue by making platforms liable. We'll see further restrictions. Less content will be available.

A service like Netflix only has 4000 movie titles:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/netflix-movie-catalog-size-has-gone-down-since-2010-2018-2

Want to see that old cult movie some friend told you about? Chances are it simply won't be obtainable anywhere. Gathering dust on some shelf somewhere because the copyright owner wants their other content pushed through.

The most important argument:

I don't think the new directive is going to make people spend **more** money on content. People will most likely just maintain their monthly content budget. Some subscriptions here and there. They'll just consume less.

Like Jerusalim is for Israelis for example. 

We Serbs replaced and assimilated locals who were there before we arrived in 6 and 7 century.

After that we were almost always a majority there, until Ottomans arrived. Albanians converted to Islam and had better standard of living and lower taxes. So than Serbs left and settled in Hungary modern day Vojvodina.

That is the average Serbian view of Kosovo. We were the Majority, than Turks came, and Serbs left, Albanians moved in. Than Turks left, we came back but didn't settled there thanks to a already shit relations betwen Serbs and Albanians. Later whole shit of the 90s happened, 2004, 2008 etc etc.

No, comments on a website aren't subject of this article/directive. 

&gt; So, you agree that small businesses are not exempt by default. They may be exempt pending interpretation on a case by case basis, if that.

Everything will be on a case to case basis. This is civil law. For small businesses who still process large amounts of copyright protected material (in the meaning of the 2001 copyright directive) they are subject to the principle of proportionality, which means that the burden for small businesses will be much smaller. So no, they aren't an exception ""by default"" but by law (in general) and by case law. If you're the writer of a comment under an article, you might have a point (legally) to keep the intermediate liable for copyright infringement if they start selling your comment and make a rather large profit out of it. But you don't need this directive to achieve this. Otherwise it's protected by other laws (which for instance deal with ""public interest"".

I mean like, ''banish all incitements to hate and violence from the internet''? Who decides that? Macron? I thought hate speech was still free speech, not just something to be shut down because we all must respect one another.

What's more concerning to me is this line in his speech,

&gt; In this same spirit of independence, we should also ban the funding of European political parties by foreign powers. 

In France, the main banks have a ban on funding parties like FN already, so if he's to implement the barring of funds from foreign sources/powers (like how the FN receives funds from Russian banks) then where do major parties like FN continue to get their funding? Their own banks won't lend to them, it's not as though the other parties like Macrons rely on donations so the whole concept seems like a really scummy way to take down his opponents without having to actually beat them by having a better plan.

Also,

*THERE IS NO GERMAN VIEW*

We are a federal republic. The political differences between Bavaria and say, Hamburg or Saarland or Berlin are enormous and comparable to the differences between the Eastern European EU member states.

Our federal nature makes it necessary to build consensus between the states, which is the reason why Germany is always so slow on the uptake of grand proposals.

Eastern European governments could actually work on common strategies with individual German states and thus influence the German 'consensus policy' that emerges.

No, fundamentally wrong. *Copy*right is the right to copy, it has its roots in the old monopoly rights to publish plays, music or books, which [kings granted to special people](https://books.google.ru/books?id=ZzQ3BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=music+publish+monopoly&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l02_uQA7gX&amp;sig=ACfU3U31osdLpeg8oOJNoryN9eSCd5vQgA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwienae54OrgAhXhpIsKHajeClYQ6AEwB3oECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=music%20publish%20monopoly&amp;f=false).

It's totally orthogonal to the authors' right and protects the rich ass you signed your contract with. Like if, say, Hideo Kojima would make another MGS game, or even publish the old one, he would be instantly sued for copyright violation.

Now, you might say, well this is Trump, he makes no sense. But he is still US president, for whom a lot of people voted for and still support and share his sentiments. So even if trump is voted out in 2020, his voters and their views remain.

Assuming that America will forever be the America from the Cold War - the guard dog of the west, ready to tear a new one to every enemy - is a pretty wishful and utopian look from Europe. The USA is pretty far away, has its own problems, and its view and stance on international matters is subject to change. Even its global influence is subject to change.
