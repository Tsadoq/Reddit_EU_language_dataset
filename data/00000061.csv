https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Stanton

&gt; Gregory H. Stanton is the former Research Professor in Genocide Studies and Prevention at the George Mason University in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. He is best known for his work in the area of genocide studies. He is the founder and president of Genocide Watch,[1] the founder and director of the Cambodian Genocide Project,[2][3] and the Chair of the Alliance Against Genocide. From 2007 to 2009 he was the President of the International Association of Genocide Scholars. 

&gt; In 1999 Stanton founded Genocide Watch,[10] a non-governmental organization campaigning against genocide based in Washington, D.C..[16][17] Genocide Watch is the Chair and Coordinator of the Alliance Against Genocide, which includes 70 organizations in 24 countries, including the Minority Rights Group, the International Crisis Group, the Aegis Trust, and Survival International.[18] Its board of advisers includes former commander of United Nations peacekeeping forces in Rwanda Roméo Dallaire, former Nuremberg Prosecutor Benjamin Ferencz, and former US Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power.[19]

&gt; In 2010, Genocide Watch was the first[20] organization to assert that the 1980s Gukurahundi massacres in Zimbabwe met the definition of genocide, calling for the prosecution of Zimbabwean leaders including president Robert Mugabe.[21][22][23]

&gt; In 2019, the organization issued alerts regarding the risk of genocide of the Muslim population in the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir and Assam.[24][25]

&gt; In 2020, the organization joined in signing an open letter by various rights groups urging the U.N. Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to investigate the actions of the Chinese government regarding Turkic Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region, and ""develop strategies"" to end the alleged violations which they consider to be acts of genocide.[26] In the case of Bosco Ntaganda within the International Criminal Court investigation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Genocide Watch submitted amicus curiae observations[27] along with the Antiquities Coalition and Blue Shield International, on the interpretation of attacks on cultural property in the Rome Statute.[28]

47,"POLAND AND Hungary have both been at odds with the European Union over breaches of the rule of law, but until now one difference between them has been the relative robustness of Polish media, which counts numerous independent outlets. That may be about to change. Following a narrow victory in July’s presidential election, the ruling Law and Justice party broadcast its intention to “re-Polonize” and “deconcentrate” the nongovernment media — by which it evidently means, turn them into official mouthpieces.

Senior Polish officials last week confirmed reports that a state-owned oil company is negotiating to purchase 20 of the 24 regional newspapers in the country, which are currently owned by a German publishing group. That has been the pattern in Hungary, where independent journalism has been eliminated not by brute censorship but through the purchase of outlets by the government or friendly businessmen.

For those not eager to sell, Law and Justice’s leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, has signaled that the party may press ahead with two laws it has long threatened to pass. One would limit foreign ownership of Polish media outlets, while the other would force the breakup of media companies that have multiple outlets. “Media in Poland should be Polish,” says Mr. Kaczynski, a nationalist populist who crusades against immigrants and gay rights. The obvious targets are newspapers, magazines and a television channel wholly or partially owned by German and U.S. companies.

The government’s campaign could devastate what remains of Polish democracy, which has already been badly weakened by Law and Justice’s takeover of the judiciary. Poland’s most popular and respected newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, is part of a conglomerate that also owns radio stations and a publishing house and is partly owned by two U.S. companies. The most influential television station — now that Law and Justice has turned the state broadcaster into a propaganda outlet — is TVN, which is owned by Discovery Inc., an American multinational. The government has already damaged Gazeta Wyborcza by blocking advertising purchases by state companies.

Media with U.S. connections might have some protection: The Kaczynski government styles itself as pro-American. To her credit, the U.S. ambassador in Warsaw, Georgette Mosbacher, has publicly pushed back against the incipient crackdown, tweeting that “forced fragmentation of the media will limit freedom of speech because only State-owned and small outlets will survive.” Pressure on German-owned media could also attract attention in Berlin and Brussels just as the European Union is debating whether to link an economic recovery package and long-term budget to respect by aid recipients for the rule of law.

Mr. Kaczynski, however, is sounding defiant. He has threatened that Poland would veto the E.U. budget rather than meet its democratic standards. As Donald Tusk, a former president of the European Council and a former Polish prime minister put it, Mr. Kaczynski “is ready to block E.U. aid for Poland so that he can continue to violate the rule of law with impunity.” If he persists in his attacks on free press, his government ought to suffer consequences in Washington, as well.",Luxembourg,/r/europe/comments/jh6r43/polands_campaign_against_the_press_could/g9w1jzm/,JackRogers3,1603535604

74,"I remember reading William Shirer's ""Rise and fall of the Third Reich"". It was a somber and dark read. And every now and then, the book would move to cover Italian exploits. Then it would turn into an episode of Alo Alo.

Like when Hitler occupied France and allowed Mussolini to take the South France, as a consolation, non strategically important goal. Benito called his gaudy marshalls and asked them what the readiness is - 85 fully equipped divisions yearning to spread the glory of the new Roman Empire, they replied.

Then Count Ciano, Mussolini's son in law and foreign minister, asked some younger generals in private what the real readiness was. It was 2 and a half divisions, shabbily equipped. 

So Mussolini launched the glorious offensive which managed to capture an undefended French village in a valley just across the border. With this success achieved, the soldiers decided to celebrate by raiding the wine and cheese and having a party. In the meantime, the villagers who ran away to the neighbouring hills got together, took pitchforks and takes, jumped the blissfully sleeping Italian heroes and routed them back across the border. 

When Mussolini heard of this he lost his mind and ordered all available forced to steamroll France up to the Atlantic ocean. So off they went again, reoccupied the village and progressed some 50 kilometers, until they ran into a medieval fortress defended by a hundred soldiers or so. These soldiers started firing at them, which put the Italians in a very unpleasant situation. So they dug in and held this line until the end of the war.",,/r/europe/comments/jh5rqo/on_24_october_1917_the_joint_austrohungarian_and/g9w24g1/,-martinique-,1603535896

76,"&gt; Yeah sure how about you take care of your northern Irish terrorists. Brits whine a lot about them.  

I am not from the UK. But Nothern Ireland has the right to be an independent country, just as Scotland.

&gt; Dude, even Poles and slovaks, which aren't bigger than 50k here, have the right to learn in their native language and each minority has a place in the parliment. Also our first king built in 1910 a mosque for the Tatars in the style of ottoman ones.

Has nothing to do with what I said. Enough dumb whataboutism.

&gt; Yeah ok you treat black people equal to the british people, while you discriminate and make false propaganda against Romanians because some shitass Nigel Farage keeps saying ""I don't hate Romanians but I have a huge problem with Romania"" or ""People would be worried if a group of romanian people would move nextdoor"" while Boris Johnson stated clearly that he values and respects the Romanian workers. Also if you bring up crime and drunk and vandalization or stuff like that, remember England has increasing poverty, people walk down the street drunk with no shame and nobody mocks them yet everyone is making propaganda against us for doing the same things on a lower scale (well except poverty, we have a higher rate). Before you shit on Romanians, think about how would you feel if people would say things like Farage says about us everyday.

I am not from the UK. But the UK has the right to discriminate against whoever it wants as long as they are not citizens. Black British citizens are citizens, period. If you go to someone else's country, you do as they say and you abide their laws. Otherwise stay the hell home. They have the RIGHT to let in whoever they want, and they have the RIGHT to deport whoever they want. If they want to give more rights to, let's say, Germans, and fewer right to Romanians, they can do it, it is THEIR country, not yours. You have no right to tell other country what to do in their territory. And you have no legitimacy to pretend the right to live in another country if they don't want you there.

Giving birth to such a fetus could mean years of caring for a being leading a tortured existence full of pain and misery for both the child and its parents. And that's one of the better outcomes, since the fetus could potentially be already dead within the womb, leaving the woman with a dead mass of cells in her uterus, forcing to carry the full term of the pregnancy, then in a grotesque, gruesome ceremony, deliver it in a hospital bed. Or look at their ""child"" with its organs hanging out of its body. Being forcefully subjected to this is inhuman and it is an ideological punishment straight from the dark ages of humanity.

Thats exactly the problem we are trying to address.
We cant free the people when they dont want to be freed. Every attempt to free the people when they are not ready to be freed will fail miserably. This is why a revolution is rather a slow process than just an abrupt change in how 8 billion people think, organize, live and act. Our current objective is to educate the masses so that they dont oppose a new/better socioeconomic system so we or our descendants can proceed to build the very system that we all deserve and desire. This is also why i love to educate people.

&gt;Finally, do you honestly think communism will ever be implemented at a global scale in say Europe?

Thats a very good question i cant answer. Nobody can. But nevertheless, if we dont try, it will certainly not happen. I refuse to believe that those millions of people who have fought and died for a better world over the last two centuries have done so in vain.

But there are definitely many examples of anarchist societies in the real world, be it Rojava (not fully anarchist though, 5 million inhabitants) or makhnovia (7 million inhabitants, fought against totalitarian USSR). 
Compare that to ireland which has only ~5 million inhabitants.

Here is an excerpt from the foreword of the book ""ABC of Anarchism"" by Alexander Berkmann:

&gt;I consider anarchism the most rational and practical conception of a social life in freedom andharmony. I am convinced that its realization is a certainty in the course of human development.The time of that realization will depend on two factors: first, on how soon existing conditionswill grow spiritually and physically unbearable to considerable portions of mankind, particularly to the laboring classes; and, secondly, on the degree in which Anarchist views will becomeunderstood and accepted.Our social institutions are founded on certain ideas; as long as the latter are generally believed, the institutions built on them are safe. Government remains strong because people think politicalauthority and legal compulsion necessary. Capitalism will continue as long as such an economicsystem is considered adequate and just. The weakening of the ideas which support the evil andoppressive present-day conditions means the ultimate breakdown of government and capitalism.
Progress consists in abolishing what man has outlived and substituting in its place a more suitable environment.It must be evident even to the casual observer that society is undergoing a radical change in itsfundamental conceptions. The World War and the Russian Revolution are the main causes of it.The war has unmasked the vicious character of capitalist competition and the murderous incompetency of governments to settle quarrels among nations, or rather among the ruling financialcliques. It is because the people are losing faith in the old methods that the Great Powers are nowcompelled to discuss limitation of armaments and even the outlawing of war. It is not so longago that the very suggestion of such a possibility met with utmost scorn and ridicule.


Alexander Berkmann was a very well known Anarchist, his most popular book ""ABC of Anarchism"" is a quick read and written in easy language so that every average-person can understand it. Everyone knows it and it will be the first recommendation you get from anarchists when asking about where to start. There are a few different versions of it out there, [here](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/alexander-berkman-what-is-communist-anarchism) is one of them.

If we view a zygote/embryo as a human life which is not harming a woman body-wise, but the woman decides to get an abortion because of some reason - is that not a case of one person (woman) making a decision about someone else’s (baby’s) body autonomy?

395,"A lot of Luxembourg people supported the Belgian independence, and Luxembourg was annexed by the newly formed state in 1830, with the exception of Luxembourg city, which was controlled by a Prussian garrison. The exact same thing happened in Limburg, which was originally rebelling with the other Belgian provinces, but the Dutch garrison in Maastricht refused to let it go. In both cases, the situation between 1831 and 1839 was that Belgium controlled the whole territory, except for the one major town (Luxembourg and Maastricht, respectively). And in both cases, the outcome settled in the 1839 London Treaty was that the region should be split in half.

&gt; Luxembourg was profoundly affected by the Belgian Revolution of 1830. Many in Luxembourg supported the cause of the Belgian secessionists, and indeed most of the country was de facto annexed by the new Belgian state, while only the capital Luxembourg City remained loyal to the Dutch King, as it was garrisoned by Prussian troops. The situation was only resolved in 1839, when the Dutch King consented to the partition of Luxembourg. In the Treaty of London of 1839, the French-speaking parts of Luxembourg were carved off to form part of Belgium, while the remaining German-speaking part made up the rump Grand-Duchy, and would continue to be ruled by the Dutch King-Grand Duke, even though it was now territorially separated from the Netherlands. It would also remain in the German Confederation.

The revolution was way too short-lived to have a proper political programme beyond 'Ruskies go home' and 'f*ck Stalinist policies' - the latter including collectivisation and abolition of private property. Especially in the countryside, revolutionary movements turned towards re-establishing banned political parties and restoring private farms, while envisaging free elections.
Revolutions aren't about 'fixing' the extant way of things, they are about wiping them off the table.

After crushing the revolution, the Hungarian Communist party could never to this day cope with the fact that their hold on power was essentially founded on betraying (and, quite bloodily, crushing) a genuine revolution and being installed by a hostile foreign power.

No doubt, under the Maritime Zones Act, Parliament expressly asserted sovereignty of this country over the territorial waters but simultaneously, asserted its authority to determine/alter the limit of the territorial waters"". This finding meant that under Indian law India's contiguous zone could be treated as part of India's territorial sea, effectively granting India a territorial sea of 24 nautical miles

&gt; On 14 January 2015, European MEPs appealed to the Italian government not to forget the two victims of the Enrica Lexie incident and urged EUHRVP Federica Mogherini, who was formerly Italian Foreign Minister, not to hold the wider economic interests of European member states hostage to the bilateral dispute between Italy and India.

So initially any damaged and unimportant buildings were stripped in 50s and during 60s reconstruction projects started to fix up whatever was left.

Perhaps it is as you described, uncertaintity of post-war politics dictated those steps and 60s brought in a degree of confidene that changed the view.

533,"Pretty much. To provide some context for some socialist movements and revolutions, broadly speaking there's typically two camps of socialists/communists: revolutionary and evolutionary. 

Revolutionary socialists seek to essentially forcefully seize control of government and use this power to transfer ownership of the means of production to the workers, and from there either remain socialist or use socialism as a transitionary state to communism. The later being the intent of the Russian Revolution. However in the case of the Russian Revolution once that power was seized it was centralized amongst a small group who essentially switched their goal to maintaining power instead of moving more towards a socialist state or communist society. Same can be said for China and such. 

Evolutionary socialists seek to gradually transition to socialism via current legislative means: having socialists elected to government and producing socialist legislation. In many cases where such governments were elected they were overthrown via US backed military coup such as the case in Chile.  

Also worth noting one camp isn't inherently authoritarian or libertarian. There are libertarian revolutionaries, such as many sects of fighters on the Republican side of the Spanish Civil War (where there were also authoritarian revolutionary socialists, such as Marxist-Leninists). And you can have evolutionary socialists who wish to enact more authoritarian policy through government as well. 

And of course many socialists wouldn't want a transition towards a communist society after achieving the creation of a socialist state. 

Essentially, there's a great many differing camps of socialists, and to treat them all as if they're USSR loving Stalinists who think that more tanks = more better is a very ignorant view of the subject. And of course, you'll get differing views and definitions of some things depending on how you ask, it's a mess at times, but it's worth understanding to be able to know what some people actually support.",Canada,/r/europe/comments/jgm39e/today_is_the_64th_anniversary_of_the_revolution/g9tqp3o/,Melon_Cooler,1603499699

If she said that ""borders are borders"" and that those who come would be immediatelly deported, the whole mess would not start (at least to some degree: it is probably Russia and Turkey sending the immigrants from Syria in order to destabilize Europe). But Merkel didnt make the correct decision: she was trying to get more votes of leftist / antiracist voters in Germany. And consequently the whole mess started.

Since there was no decisive reply and immigrants could come, more and more started coming. What overwhelmed Greece (who already had its own share of problems), Italy (who already had its own share of problems) and even Germany: who tried to push those immigrants to other EU countries. What is unsustainable, since there are millions in Africa - they all want to come to Europe, but they all cannot come to Europe, since it is unsustainable.

Poland has its own fair share of problems (as most countries), you probably think about the 2 million Poles living in other EU countries - but you dont understand that they would gladly come back to own country if the economic prospects were better. But bringing tens of thousands (or more?) of African and Syrian immigrants who would live off social benefits would not benefit for the actual Poles at all. So people voted for right wing populists.

The same sentiment happened in Germany, Italy, or Greece. Merkel is directly responsible for right wing popularity in whole Europe. She got outplayed by Russia. There are many connections between right wing populists and Russia.

So now you don't think parents should have children at all, since those parents would have absolute control of those children's lives, so that'd be tyranny and corruption?

I would definitely like to learn more about Communism going forward, although being honest I don't think I would personally every become a communist, I'd still like to be more informed on the topic. But I have total respect for people like you.

Now sorry if I'm being a pain in the ass but you clearly know what you're talking about so I have some more questions if that's ok:

1. How do communists plan on implementing communism and is the only way to do it by revolution?

2. Is it true that communists think the same of both Donald Trump and Joe Biden? It's what I've seen on reddit anyways.

3. Random question, what happens to the farmers? Where I'm from (Ireland), theres basically small farmers dotted everywhere and I couldn't imagine anything happening to them.

Finally, do you honestly think communism will ever be implemented at a global scale in say Europe? Like  I'm pretty sure some people have a really negative view on the matter and a lot of people haven't even heard of it, in Ireland anyways.

Hungary, Orban was already in power and was going to stay in power anyways.

Yes, doctors can face retaliation for performing an abortion based on a prosecutor saying that it's fine if the judge then decides that the rapist is not guilty for whatever reason, including the ones I listed. That is an obvious problem.

Yes, the police not taking reports of rapes is a problem regardless of whether it's a problem with the definition of the law or not.

Yes, the fact that rape only covers a specific thing in Polish law is a problem because “abortion in case of rape” is in fact allowed only in that specific instance. If you get blackmailed into sex, even with threats of death, and get pregnant as a result, according to Polish law it wasn't rape but another unlawful act and as such you cannot abort. Yes, it is how it works.

You never got raped, did you? I did. According to Polish law it wasn't rape, never mind the fact that I was 10 and blackmailed into it and it couldn't have been anything but rape. I also know people who got raped and tried to report it.

Good because the public opinion in the West favours not helping Turkey anymore, even against Russia although your bitch president [begged for Patriots after the poor Syrian army began killing your bitch soldiers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-20/turkey-asks-u-s-for-patriot-missiles-to-deter-russia-in-idlib), which was declined.   
  
&gt;we don’t need a 200 year old country to do that shit. We were here for thousands and will be superpowers like you come and go.

America is older then Turkey, you weren't there for thousands of years, you're the descendants of people who are a mix of generations of migrants of different ethnicities including Greeks and Armenians just like our ancestors who are descendants of different generations of migrants from Europe and other places to this continent you uneducated person.  
  
And if you wanna count Ottoman history as yours, which isn't, they got their asses spanked by every major power from Habsburgs to Russia, Britain and France before its inevitable collapse into a thousand pieces.   
  
   
&gt;We were your most loyal allies for years   
   
No you never really our ally or partner, you just wanted things to do your own thing and not listen to anybody.  
  
First you begged money in the form of marshall aid and then you begged to become a nato member when your country was threatened an invasion by stalin and we took you in with some demands of our own in exchange to protect you from Soviet invasion. And since then you've been begging money, trade, weapons, and you throw a hissy fit when you get declined. 
  
&gt;Years and years you have funded organisations within Turkey and this is nothing but a closed up threat to Turkey because we are getting closer with other players in the pitch.  
  
Turkey is not America's equal. America will fund whoever it wishes and soon after pkk gets unlisted from terror organisations, the US and UK will probably list turkey as a state sponsor of terror. You're just sour because people in the west don't buy your bullshit reasons to commit yet another genocide (on Kurds this time) and you won't be sold F-35s. Greece and UAE will get them, but don't worry, you have your S-400s and F-16s (American made).

From there 150 000 were sent to Nazi Germany as slave labourers and to German nazi Concentration Camps. The rest was forcefully relocated to western districts of General Government and left there mostly without a roof over a head, food, money etc., so basically homeless.

734,"&gt;""gently"" doesn't automatically mean ""beat them to shit"".

Oh you are not beating the shit out of her, only light punches, it's ok then, and also ignore the whole first part ""and righteous women are devoutly obedient and, when alone, protective of what Allah has entrusted them with.1 And if you sense ill-conduct from your women,"" it's very very telling that you don't even see this part as a a problem.

&gt;So don't be too quick to assume Islam is inherently far, far worse than Christianity. It's all cancer, even if Islam might be eeeeeeeever so slightly more cancerous.

Sad attempt at deflection. I don't give a shit what Christianity says. We are discussing Islam.



&gt;And guess what? These are easily interpreted as only being defensive killings, or only being true in a very specific context. If ""infidels"" literally attack you with armies, you're morally justified in defending your country, no? It all comes down to interpretation, which is heavily influenced by your culture. Muslim countries tend to be hyper-conservative, but that's not the fault of the religion.

Blatant lie. Why do you people not understand that this is not the middle ages anymore. People can just read the Quran. It's not talking about self defense.


&gt;Are you literally me from years ago? Why do you believe muslims can only be ""good"" if they follow your interpretation of their holy text? Isn't it possible they have different interpretations, that might even align them very heavily with you and me?

The rest is just you babbling a lot of nonsense, and repeating the same thing again and again. I already said, you can be a Muslim and a good person. Im not judging a person. Im judging a book and a belief system. The belief system is sexist and immoral. If you follow it, you follow a belief system that does not respect women, ergo you can not be a true Muslim and respect women.

Again: ""And righteous women are devoutly obedient and, when alone, protective of what Allah has entrusted them with.1 And if you sense ill-conduct from your women, advise them ˹first˺, ˹if they persist,˺ do not share their beds"" Even without the beating part this is not respectfull.

770,"&gt;kill the unborn on the basis of being disabled

They say it's unconstitutional to have an abortion *even if* the fetus is non-viable or cannot survive outside the womb. The result of this ruling is that it will force:

1. a traumatic and catastrophic late-term miscarriage, or
2. a child being stillborn, or
3. a child being born but dying within minutes, hours or days after being born (at ""best""), or
4. extreme risk of sepsis when the fetus dies in the womb.

It's not about aborting kids because they have a disability. It's about fucking human dignity. Like I've said elsewhere, it's not about ""pro-life"", it's about anti-death. The abortion law in Poland *is now interpreted more strictly than in Iran and Saudi Arabia*.

Snowden made $1.2m in speaking fees in the past 5 years. He was making between $120k-200k a year before fleeing, and probably secured some of his savings abroad before leaving the US.

I very much doubt your high-profile lawyer charges $240k for 5 minutes, which is what Snowden has been making in Russia every year since he arrived. We're talking about a country with a median income of $6.5k per year.

I do not think this is misleading. In fact, it helps people make decisions on how to incorporate the plant based alternative into their diet. If they read ""almond butter"" they know they can probably use it as a ""drop-in"" replacement for butter. And so on.

995,"&gt; Zwarte piet as you know him was DESIGNED in 1850 by a teacher.

Not at all. It is true that Schenkman invented the figure; but he invvented neither the name nor his modern appearance. Schenkman's depiction doesn't look like a stereotype. The big red lips are entirely missing, the curly hair isn't as emphasized, his attire is much less flashier and looks more like a realistic interpretation of northern-african styles at the time.

&gt; Not saying ALL DUTCH are racist, I'm saying the dutch BACK THEN were most likely racist.

I absolutely agree with this. However, referring to Schenkman as such, at least in terms of Zwarte Piet (he supposedly had some questionable anti-semitic views) is an odd take given that he was a prominent abolitionist and his invention of the character appears to have been intended to have a humanizing effect. Once the character he introduces becomes popular, you very quickly see him turn into the typical racist stereotype, unfortunately.

&gt; Before that he was a demon with horns.

While a popular interpretation, there is actually no evidence that Zwarte Piet is related to Krampus at all. ""Demonic"" helpers joining Sinterklaas in his various guises around Europe are a relatively modern thing, he existed on his own for centuries before then; and there has never been a Krampus like figure in the Dutch traditions. Prior to Schenkman, Sinterklaas was a solitary figure in the Netherlands.

&gt; Why this dutch teacher thought that a black guy is a better servant to St. Niklas is open for debate.

Have you actually *looked* at how Schenkman depicted the figure?  For one, unlike today's Zwarte Piet, he had his own horse, and Sinterklaas and Zwarte Piet (who is actually never named that in Schenkman's book) appear to divide the physical labor between them.",Flevoland (Netherlands),/r/europe/comments/jfhzst/teaching_white_privilege_as_uncontested_fact_is/g9ru1m6/,nybbleth,1603470870

1030,"The COVID-19 vaccine being developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca has been shown to work as planned by new analysis.

A method to check the inoculation contains all the correct parts was developed by a team at Bristol University, providing greater evidence that the vaccine works.

Even though the research has not yet been peer reviewed, it has been hailed as a ""wonderful example of cross-disciplinary collaboration"".

The vaccine is currently undergoing Phase 3 clinical trials to further establish the safety of the treatment.

It comes after confirmation the trials will continue after a man taking part died in Brazil. It is understood that the man was taking a placebo and not the active vaccine.

The new method of analysis allowed scientists to check that the vaccine was properly designed to replicate the parts of the COVID-19 make-up needed to train the immune system to fight the disease.

The study proved that the vaccine is correctly programmed to replicate the ""spike protein"" associated with COVID-19 that has been inserted into the immunisation shot.

This protein is what the body's immune system will learn to attack - providing people with the biological tools needed to battle the virus.

Dr David Matthews, of Bristol's School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, who led the research, said: ""This is an important study as we are able to confirm that the genetic instructions underpinning this vaccine, which is being developed as fast as safely possible, are correctly followed when they get into a human cell.

""Until now, the technology hasn't been able to provide answers with such clarity, but we now know the vaccine is doing everything we expected and that is only good news in our fight against the illness.""

Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the University of Oxford and lead on the Oxford vaccine trial, added: ""This is a wonderful example of cross-disciplinary collaboration, using new technology to examine exactly what the vaccine does when it gets inside a human cell.

""The study confirms that large amounts of the coronavirus spike protein are produced with great accuracy, and this goes a long way to explaining the success of the vaccine in inducing a strong immune response.""",,/r/europe/comments/jgo4ey/coronavirus_oxfordastrazeneca_vaccine_behaves_as/g9rf4az/,quixotic_cynic,1603463287

&gt;That's... That's not what it means. Not to mention there are alternatives to masks.

That is absolutely what it means. We have laws telling people what to do with their bodies, another example having to wear clothes in public. What is one more law that doesn't allow killing children?

Yes there is? Even the previous commenter agreed there is.

1087,"While I'm not disputing that you can argue that this rule is sexist, what you are describing is not really historically accurate. For example, this rule did not actually exist during Biblical times. The Bible makes it quite clear that Jewish society was actually patrilineal and the children of a Jewish man with a gentile wife, were generally regarded to be Jews. Likewise in the case of slaves, for example it was required that the male children born to a slave mother had to be circumcised. The switch to a matrilineal system occurred pretty late in the game, and really only crystallized after Jews became exiled. Why exactly this switch happened is not exactly clear, one possibility being that it was influenced by Roman law. During the same time, slavery essentially became extinct in the Jewish diaspora.",Europa,/r/europe/comments/jgk1lb/europes_jewish_population_down_60_since_1970_as/g9rfsvw/,HugodeGroot,1603463649

1130,"I think no nation state has a right to exist, but people have a right to be able to continue their cultural practices and use their language, to the extent that they don't oppress those who wish to not follow them.

I would personally like to see a merged israel/palestine, or something like that, because having an ever expanding jewish state, and an increasingly controlled and impoverished non-jewish state just leads to more tension. That would kind of fusion would of course be tremendously difficult, but having these interpenetrating states divided predominantly along ethnic lines means that arabic and palestinian Israeli citizens are suspected by police of being non-citizens, because they share family or ethnicity of people from the group who are being pushed back into these smaller and smaller areas.

I think that any state must justify itself by what it does for its people, and how it behaves beyond its borders, and if any country's citizens want to form a new set of states and break up a historic nation state into smaller nations even though they share language and culture with each other, then that is their business, so long as they do it in a way that respects the people of other regions who used to have resource claims in their areas, do it in ways that share that wealth etc.

Israeli people have a right to exist, Jewish people of all their subgroups, and the distinctive quality that elevates the state of Israel is its commitment to protecting a historically persecuted people, and I think any successor state must develop its constitution to continue that responsibility, while also respecting the rights of people who are not Jewish, ethnically or religiously. Or if Israel just swallows Palestine, they should show some recognition of the history of the region they are taking over, and respect for their cultural practices and allow them to continue their lives, while also continuing that broader mission.

There's no magic line that allows you to mark out a legitimate nation state, is south sudan more culturally distinctive than certain regions of nigeria? Are regions that do not yet have independence having their right to existence denied? Or should we say that whatever exists has a right to continue existing, and the formation of any new state that threatens that should be rejected, again, for the right of existance of the nation state?

&gt;Not to mention you pretty much require some form of greater authority to lay out the moral frameworks for man, \[...\] If you impose a morality that X is good, and another person says X is bad, who is correct?

Then who is objectively correct? The Hindu, the Muslim or the Christian? Perhaps the indigenous shaman? Is cutting of the hand of a thief morally right? What about eating pork? Muslims assert that dogs are impure, is that true? Or is it all

&gt;opinions of men and hold equal value, hence it becomes a subjective mess of nonsense.

This terror attack was condoned with some verses in the Quran and countered by others. Are or are you not to stone the homosexuals as a Christian? How about selling your daughter to slavery, is it no longer true?

&gt;You might try to make a naturalistic arguments like ""just listen to your empathy"", while this may operate relatively well, you will at least have 5% of people who are psychopathic and will cause havoc in society, probably more due to opportunists looking to gain something out of it.

And you claim this act of beheading a teacher in the name of the greater power is not a part of that 5%? What about the inquisition, was it guided by divine principles of ethics, reason and logic? Your imagined society seems to not have the concept of laws, which sounds very unfortunate.

&gt;You might also try to make some kind of logical game of utility, but then it becomes again a subjective mess based on whatever is perceived as utility, which is the greater evil? Forcing a christian bakery to bake a cake for a couple that their religion doesn't align with, or allowing them their religious and private corporation freedom(which in turn oppresses the couple)? You will get a lot of different answers for that one, hence it's not really consistent.

That's a good question. And a Lutheran, Anglican, Greek Orthodox and a Roman Catholic will have different justifications for their views. The Evangelic-Lutheran church here would consider it unethical to refuse basic service to anyone because of their birth, in fact, a church social worker helped during the HIV crisis to give humane rights, education and treatment to those infected instead of punishing them. Saving countless lives.

That was in the 80's. In modern times, the United States Attorney General, a Christian, voiced ""his disagreement with policies that made the state responsible for the “costs of misconduct,” such as “handing out condoms” to prevent AIDS instead of forcing people to take “sexual responsibility” themselves. "" This view seems to be shared with many evangelical organizations in the U.S., as abortions are abhorred but so are the cures: sexual education and contraception, both of which these evangelicals also dislike.

Is the right answer letting homosexuals and drug users die, or is helping them avoid HIV religiously more ethical? Should we provide sexual education and contraceptives to stop teenage pregnancies and STI's? If we ask people with a belief in a superior power:

&gt;You will get a lot of different answers for that one, hence it's not really consistent.

I'll leave it with this one.

""As an anthropologist, I have often heard people argue that without religion there is no morality. And last year, during the presidential campaign, Ted Cruz argued that people of all faiths have the constitutional right to run for the presidency, but atheists are not fit for the job. However, data from the Federal Bureau of Prisons suggest that atheists are far less likely to commit crimes than religious people, and globally the least religious countries have the lowest crime rates. This is of course correlational evidence: it does not mean that being an atheist *leads* to committing fewer crimes.

First of all, apparently my view of them is a popular one among Poles (it's also one I hear often myself), so it's hardly a misinformation for an external observer. To state the facts, Konfederacja is a coalition with the majority who does come from a party which in fact is strongly pro free-market, and the others come from ultra catholic nationalists. It's conceivable that most members have free-market background, it's possible that many don't agree with ultra catholic positions.

Having said that, most of top figures in the final mix are the ultra ones (at least 2 out of 3 leaders, chairman, vice-chairman and presidential candidate - almost all top figures, Wilk who is a popular figure among others) and they very clearly overpower the voice of the free-marketers.

To make this work, the government must make sure that all kids are actually in school, and participating. They should also levy fines or remove children from parents that do violate these rules. 

I think that a national organization that is heavily audited by the state must be setup to dictate who gets to be an imam and practice in the country. Too many rogue and hateful imams seem to be floating around society and should be delegitimized. 

Finally, a movement should be pushed to reject religious conservatism as weak and pathetic (which it is). It should be framed as a patriotic duty to uphold secularity and the state should integrate this into education, military, and politics. There needs to be more thought as to how to design this to work effectively, however. 

Alternatively if none of this works, I think immigration from countries with incompatibilities with French society should be blanket stopped.

Indeed. And Frisian is indeed the closest language to English there is.

&gt; You literally said Frisian is the same as Old English

Partly correct, I said basically, which isn't exactly 'the same'. Perhaps I should've specified that with old English I didn't mean 1000 years old like what you're sharing.

When you look at the mid 12th century English, you'll see Frisian is much closer than icelandic for example. To use you format;

Identity is way more complex than we here in Estonia and Latvia have reduced it to - linguistics is not the end-all of everything.

Some do - but speak Latvian as we did in the 1930ies.

&gt; what is essentially illegal immigration and ignoring the fact that we've accepted a lot of unintegrateable people.

Two things here - first of all illegal immigration - sure, that is a problem. But then let's work on establishing clear and easy migration possibilities. In migration theory one possible type of migration pattern is ''circular migration - seasonal workers, for an example, who go back to their homes because of the ease of travel. Just one possibility.

With regards to ''unintegratable people'' - what definition of integration are you using? Or are you talking assimilation?

&gt; I don't agree that ethnonationalism needs to go. I'm proud to speak an extremely unique language and have unique culture, and it needs to be protected. 

There is nothing in ethnicity that limits someone from speaking Estonian or adhering to Estonian culture. I could move to Estonia and become the best fucking Estonian ever - even if there is not a drop of Estonian blood - i.e. I am not an ethnic Estonian. You can integrate people into cultures (which can lead to assimilation) without bringing ethnicity into it. I repeat what I said - I have considerable Russian blood, which I have no interest in and it literally does not influence me at all.

Multiculturalism has nothing to do with ethnic purity,  and multiculturalism, by the way, does not in any way discount the possibility of integration. Again - Switzerland has multiple cultures, which manage to live together.

You're talking about extremely poor and unintegrated multiple-generation racial minority migrant communities, who not only face horrible socioeconomic conditions, in many cases due to the ethnonationalistic principles we Europeans like to style ourselves, they are disconnected from even becoming ''French'' or ''Dutch'', or whatever.

I will use science now. A zygote/fetus doesn't have sentience/higher consciousness so whatever you do to it it won't feel it. Their nervous system hasn't developed yet meaning they have no synapses. No synapses means electrical impulses that carry information, such as pain and other feelings, won't be felt. So tell me how is it immoral and wrong to kill something when it won't even KNOW or FEEL being killed. 

&gt;but the FACTS and the well known scientific evidence for the duration of humanity does not support your half baked opinion.

I just told you the facts and scientific consensus. Your opinion was half baked. Also you just explained to me the process of reproduction, you didn't say why a foetus/zygote is a child. I actually gave a scientific explanation as to why a foetus/zygote isn't a child. Also you deflected my questioning of why you don't support other life forms being not killed.

The European Court of Human Rights didn't need a change in the European Convention on Human Rights for their judgements to evolve.

At the moment, German Hospitals outside a few worst affected cities are not nearly at capacity. This may also be due to the high number of ICU beds we have (I read that NRW has five times the number per capita compared to the Netherlands).

In the same way, Christianity has inherent patriarchal, individualistic, relatively apolitical roots. It doesn't mean Christian cultures are the same way because they are also made up of a great many things. 

It TENDS TO BE more difficult to draw people to war using the image of Jesus, a pacifist carpenter, than it is using the image of Mohammed, a spiritual but also military leader figure.

But there are some interesting facets of this lockdown. Most cases in Slovakia are now spread at the workplace and in the families at home. Yet somehow me walking my dog only 100m away from my flat instead of in a larger space that's 600m away is supposed to slow down the spread.

Also, I don't understand why you're able to go wherever you want between 1a.m. and 4 a.m., that's such a strange thing.

It's worth noting that the epidemiologists were actually advising the governmemt to go with a strict lockdown and this is some kind of softer version of a lockdown. The situation in hospitals which were not chosen to be Covid centres is bad already, the one in my parent's region already is almost at full capacity in regards to Covid patients and they even have young psychiatrists or dermatologists attending to Covid patients because the few staff who should normally handle the cases are sick with Covid themselves. And they were told to ask GPs to help out, but more than a half of the GPs in the region are 61 years old or older, so it's not a good idea.

Highest one in our neighberhood is Greek one around 31.399$ which is really close. We would have already passed Greeks if Erdoğan didnt fucked our economy. The reason PPP version differs from other ones is it calculates real price of goods and services which is low on Turkey because labor costs are low.

There is no need for a consent from the father and request and consent of mother with approval of three specialist physicians and final acceptance by legal medicine center suffices. Legal abortion is allowed only before 19th week of pregnancy.[2]

In 2005, the Legal Medicine Organization of Iran created a list of 29 fetal problems and 32 maternal issues in pregnancy that indicated that abortion might possibly be legal—only if, however, it was determined that the life of the mother and the fetus were both endangered if the pregnancy went through, and that the mother could be saved by an abortion.[5] Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a fatwa to this effect, allowing abortion in the first trimester for these special cases.[10]

2126,"&gt;  You solve discrimination where one group has an unfair advantage by taking away that advantage. Do you want to make sure that whites are also discriminated to solve the problem?

But the idea of white privilege doesn't affect how you solve the issue and even then a lot of modern solutions for the problem are about removing the chance to have the privelage. Most notable would be removing name and sex from job application forms.

&gt;But I still disagree. First, I already gave that example of the African and the Chinese company discriminating him in a place where both Africans and Chinese are ethnic minorities. Second, I also already gave the argument that it's a term coined for the very specific historical situation of the USA and can't be transplanted to other places and times just like that.

Because the theory exists on societal level, not invidual people level. Having handfull of companies where certain ethnicity was promoted over others would not change the national averages where that same ethnicity was still underperforming due to discrimination on societal level.

&gt;No, the white privilege theory is specifically concerned with the slavery situation and the existence of two population groups with different rights in the same country, which involved the need for one group to distance themselves socially from the other etc.

No, that's not right, atleast in modern context. White privelage is about studying the effects of racism in a society. Historically it focused on government and active efforts by the society trough segrecation and societal separation but these days it's more about general trends in society due to racism and also taking into considiration historical events related to race.

&gt;There's no need for it. It's US-specific, and we have other concepts to adequately describe the problem (""ethnic discrimination"" which violates the principle of equality) that aren't loaded with divisive language or inappriate association like ""white privilege"".

The problem is that those terms don't accurately depict reality as well. Pretty much every study I have seen in Europe that has concerned job applications with ethnic names has come to the same conclusion. Native names have best chance, then European names, then Asian names and lastly Middle-eastern and African names. 

While ethnic discrimation occurs there is also a layer in that discrimination where whites have better outcomes generally. While not perfect it isn't some horribly racist term in my opinion since it accurately repesents facts on the ground in the nations it's being used. Altough I would support name change because of the ammount of backlash it gets solely from having the word ""white"" in it makes it impossible to have any conversation about it.

No, the person I replied to said this.

&gt;magine telling guy from Poland he has privilege. Highest male to female suicide rate in the whole world plus we were literally wiped off from map for 100 years, but noooo some raciap minirity has it worse lmao

I would assume that when refering someone from Poland and talking about suicide rates in Poland the person was in fact talking about Poles in Poland.

&gt;The article is about the UK and you compared a ""Somali Immigrant to a native Pole"" which i thought is a shite comparsion

Why do you think it's a bad comparison? Does Somali immigrant in Poland not suffer from racism thus the Polish person having white privilege?

&gt; so i asked myself what the exp.., i asked myself what i asked you

So your first thought about me talking about Somali immigrant in Poland was Polish immigrants in UK? And you decided to ask me, a person that didn't talk about UK about it? 

&gt;which btw wasnt even really answered.

I gave a definitive answer that included scientific data about the difficulty to get a job which one can extrapolate to other fields if they want but it's the best one can do without doing opinion polls which in my opinion are incredibly sbjective to both the person and the culture.

That results in heavy competition in both fields, and it benefits the consumers greatly when the companies actually have to provide great service and prices to maintain their customer base.

2357,"""Black people are significantly more likely to be poor and the system of policies in most societies keep this division in place because of generational wealth. Hence it's a systemic problem.""

- Are you just writing random senteces? What u stated has notingh  to do with generational wealth.


""Do you want me to cite studies from Greenland instead? Obviously this social concept varies a lot between different societies.""

- Are you actually this ignorat? My point was ""white privlidge"" is generalized worldwide, and you pointing put a single county makes no sense what so ever.

""Sure. Black people in the UK are almost twice as likely to have a persistently low income (defined as 60% median) compared to black people (2019 government study). Black men are more than three times as likely to die of coronavirus than white men (government statistics). Black people are stopped and searched by police almost 10x more often than white people, again according to government statistics.""

- listing random stats lol. What has coronavirus have to do with ""white privlidge""? Also there is context missing. You know black people on average also commit more crimes? So it is reasonable they get stopped more often.

""What assumptions am I making? Teaching about white privilege means teaching those facts I mentioned.""

- READ. Im not saying your making assumptions. Im saying that the concept or the theory of ""white privlidge"" is.


""It seems to me that you did, when you said ""You think throwing all white people in the same bucket is fine? [...] the concept generalizes all white people, thad being by definition racist.""

Meanwhile, earlier this year the daily new hospitalisations (is that the right word?) peaked at 474 while it stayed at 208 so far and the curve has already seemed to flatten. If logic held up we'd have to be at about 2500 daily hospitalisations. But we're not.

That would somehow imply that, while a lot more people have gotten ill, the amount that need to be hospitalised has drastically reduced.

Yeah, that was really stupid. I'm sure his supporter base liked it, but he shouldn't just preach for the choir. 


I bet many right wing Americans would like Nordic style welfare policies if it was framed right. Something in this vein: ""Give the people affordable health care to make America strong! Give free education for all children, so that they may become productive citizens! Give police officers proper training so that we may have a safer society! Use more tax money for welfare because it's our Christian duty to assist our countrymen in need!""

2466,"That's a very anthellenic carefully written in a way to paint Greece as the bad guy.

First of all, it focuses on Greece's so called ""maximalist"" claim despite it being based on the international law and completely ignores Turkey's position that Greek islands should not be allowed EEZ at all.
Thus it makes Turkey look like a victim when it's actually a bully.
I mean even if we accepted reduced EEZ for Kastellorizo, that would still not be good enough for the Turks.

Secondly, it tries to paint a picture of ""Kastellorizo detached from Greek mainland"".
What are they trying to say? That was islands are not as important as the mainland?
Kastellorizo is Greece. It is as Greece as Athens is. It's not some ""territory"" like French Guiana far away from France, it is part of the Dodecanese group of islands and an undivided part of Greece under no special administration but complete subject to Greek laws.

And finally, like a cherry on this crap cake, the anathema of sharing our resources with the Turks.
What should we share what is rightly ours according to international law, with them? What do they have to offer?
Peace and progress??? With Turkey??? As if!!!

2684,"Being part of a majority group in a country or region is of course an advantage. Even if there is no legal framework that advocates for such an advantage, it exists due to people's implicit biases. If a white person goes and lives in Turkey or Egypt or China, are they viewed as being more trustworthy, more relatable or better in any way by the majority of people? I'd argue that they do not.

If you are highly educated or skilled and land a job there that pays well, this is not evidence of some skin colour privilege. What would be, say, the average Brits experience being transplanted there?

To treat such majority privilege as something that only exists for white people, is, in my opinion, racist. In my original reply I've also never argued that being the same as the majority does not make your life easier.

To be sure there is a difference between religious extremism and I guess, extreme reaction to racism, but how much? Is it impossible for secularists to imagine how much offense a religious person would take at something that was clearly *meant* to cause offense? There are multiple complex reasons behind why Islamic fundamentalism tend to produce zealots that seem more extreme than other religions, I feel.

2856,"100 years ago there were plenty of cartoons offensive to Jews.  They didn't do that great a job of defending themselves nor did many come to their aid, no country joined WW2 to help Jews.  Millions ended up dead.  So it shouldn't be a core value to denigrate a people, or culture.  I get the impression Europe wants the Muslims to flee like some Jews tried.    
Some of these Muslims are doing, and are prepared to do what Jews maybe should have done in pre-WW2.  

Europeans have been told for centuries how deeply offensive depictions of Mohammed are to Muslims.  You aren't being bullied by Muslims, Muslims are standing up to bullies.  Simple f-ing rules to live by: dont call black people the n-word, don't depict Mohammed, dont deny the holocaust, etc...its not hard, and it is not a burden to follow.   You expect the Muslims to take it like the Jews did pre-WW2,  the thing is most are, but a few aren't, and there will always be a few that won't take the xenophobic bullying like the Jews did.

Step back and examine this.  Its not a huge burden to not depict Mohammed.  Its very easy to be respectful.  Its not giving in.  Its treating others how you wish to be treated.  Respectfully.

But by all means keep poking that hornets nest.  You shouldn't have normalized degrading Jews, learn your lessons Europe.",,/r/europe/comments/jfcj2y/charlie_hebdo_cartoons_to_be_projected_on_the/g9lz4ea/,talesfronthecrypt,1603334595

&gt;I'm not talking about the US at all. Those are entirely different arguments that I don't want to get into with you because this is entirely pointless.

Is the US not a superpower?

If yes, then it's the same _word_, so it is very relevant. But thanks for conceding this point.

&gt;I didn't ask for battles. I wanted wars, of which you gave me that Portugal won that that wasn't even in the original time frame. Because winning a battle doesn't mean you defeated a country. 

Neither does winning a war. Proof: Vietnam war.
You make no sense, next point please.

Winning battles is almost all that mattered in medieval warfare. If you do not understand that, turn off your tv and read a book.

&gt;There's never really even been a discussion, I'm not changing your mind and you aren't going to change mine. I don't know why you keep responding.

 Why do _you_ keep responding? 

&gt;A lot of assumptions here, my guy. And what you said originally was just plain wrong. ""Castille itself, countless times."" Nope, because you'd have to expand the time frame earlier for Portugal to have even defeated Castile once, which is a far cry from the ""countless times"" that you originally said.

So now we cannot expand the time frame earlier anymore? Well you, go on I'm listening because it's remarkable.

&gt;And now you're being completely melodramatic, lmao. I'm going to assume your Portuguese because I can't reconcile that someone would give enough of a shit about whether or not Portugal was a regional power or a superpower between the years 1400-1600 unless you were Portuguese yourself and wrapped your entire national identity around it.

3010,"Serious question: Isn't ""white privilege"" just ""majority privilege"" but in American society?

Presumably the symptoms of ""white privilege"" in the US are related to the society being centered around the majority of people (who happen to be Caucasian) . If that's not the case and it truly is racially based ""white privilege"", then do white people enjoy all the same privilege and power in parts of the world where they are the minority, or are the societies in those parts of the world structured to favor the majority group too?

I would imagine that a white person living in a society where they are the minority would not suddenly be granted all sorts of privilege and power by the other people in society. I would think they'd have the same kind of experiences as other minorities have in other societies.

If that's the case, then ""privilege"" is not racially based but is instead minority/majority based, which then further points to the American idea of ""white privilege"" as being a racist notion meant to make white people feel guilty about being the majority in their own societies.",,/r/europe/comments/jfhzst/teaching_white_privilege_as_uncontested_fact_is/g9l8dcn/,Prophet_60091_,1603319193

And I totally agree. In Belgium the party ""Vlaams Belang"" got an extreme amount of votes for an extreme right-wing party, especially compared to previous years. If you look closely into their agenda, you'll quickly realise it's full of shit. They didn't get so many votes by actually doing stuff, they got there by making false promises and playing in on the emotions and hatred of the population after major news events like these. 

The nationalists in Flandres want to separate Flandres from Wallonia, so what do they do? Say they are going to make sure it happens, even tho it's basically impossible at this point. A terror attack happened? Oh better make sure they are the ones who are ""most disgusted by it"" and will make sure stuff like this never happens anymore by getting rid of all immigrants. Their slogan is even ""Our people first"" referring to the white majority of Flandres. Thing is, I am sure they couldn't give less of a shit as to what happened to most people who died of terror attacks, they simply see an opportunity to push in their voice so they could get more votes and thus more power. Really disgusting.

Them saying they are going to bring in change to make sure nothing like this ever happens anymore is the same kind of promise they make when they are saying they will separate Flandres from Wallonia. Basically lying, because when it comes to actual politics they can't do shit. These men are trained to play in on emotions and to talk as to get the hate flowing to attract more voters, but when it comes to forming a government, handling a crisis or even to do simple politics, they get stuck, because they never actually thought they would get that far. 

But meanwhile they cause hate among the population towards the muslims and other minorities, most of whom are perfectly good people.

For instance in Christianity the pope can publicly deem certain deeds or views to be not approved by that religion. If the same had been true for Islam, I believe much of extremism would be gone. At the moment many people can and do interpret Qran however they see fit.

I also like to add that any large-scale movement - be it a religion or a civil rights movement - will inevitably suffer without a proper head and representation. This is why, for instance, the issue of BLM protests is such a hot topic right now.

3285,"Woops, going on a tangent again because you can't answer the question I gave are we?

 Fine, I'll answer:

It's because they claim they don't dictate the prices and suply of goods. Aka, a free market. Even though most Chinese companies are owned by the state, or are publicly owned, (which is one of the pillars of what they call ""a social market economy"") that doesn't mean it's not free. That's why I took back that it is a ""liberal"" economy, because for the reason mentioned above it isn't.

Thing is, while they don't *officially* dictate prices and suply internally (we all know they can and probably have done it to some extent), they have been known to engage in currency devaluation, which, while not directly, dictates the prices for Chinese goods externally. Basically, they control the exchange rate for the Chinese yuan and the American dollar. If today you can buy a dollar with 4 yuan, tomorrow you will need to buy it with 5, for example. This makes Chinese products very cheap for outsiders to buy, and very expensive for the Chinese to buy foreign products. This is why foreign products are considered a luxury in China, why Chinese products are usually so damn cheap and why almost all Chinese officials store their money in dollars in foreign banks. As long as the people keep buying internally made products, whose price doesn't change because they don't require outside trade in order to be produced, they won't feel like anything is any different. (this is why the Chinese knockoffs exist and why they don't respect copyright laws)

Of course, one of the requirement to join the WTO is transparency. Since they didn't report about all the currency devaluation business, or any artificial price/suply manipulation, they officially claim they are a free market economy.

Of course, everybody knew they did this. However, it was basically a deal made in heaven, that is, until China started to be very aggressive and blackmail countries and foreign companies into doing what it wants under Xi Jingping. Now the deal is no longer viable and so their companies are being slowly kicked out.

Yes, to me it is as if it is going from freedom of speech, to obligation to listen. I'm sure a lot of Muslims are ok with caricatures of Mahomet because they can just ignore them (the same way my grandpa was ok with the christ's caricature because he could just ignore the paper when coming to my parent's house). This is a right corollary to freedom of speech: yes you can say whatever you want, but I don't have to listen. (relevant XKCD : [https://xkcd.com/1357/](https://xkcd.com/1357/) )

By posting them everywhere they are basically preventing Muslims from ignoring them. some (most I hope) will still be ok with it, but others will be seduced more easily by the extremists. After all they would be fighting against a state that is getting out of its way to mock their religion and their culture (what's being done right now can easily be twisted towards this interpretation).

While the attack was terrible, it should be a perfect moment to use free speech to show how hypocrite, vile and terrible the extremist ideology is, ruin their arguments and ideological positions before they can abuse them to enroll more people. France has a history of grand speeches and public letters exposing and defending its core values (De Villepin at the UNO against the war in Iraq, Badinter speech against death penalty, Victor Hugo's ""J'accuse"", Simone veil defending the right for abortion, and many others).

It’s understandable why.

And look what’s happened? None of your predictions have ever come true. And now the world is proving you wrong. People are interested in the U.K., in establishing future strong relationships. TPP is exciting for the U.K. CANZUK opportunities are exciting for the U.K. Closer trading relations with the US are exciting for the U.K. Even a pivot to a relationship between the EU and U.K. based purely on trade is exciting for the U.K.

3395,"Look, I’m not saying that Sweden’s approach has been a perfect one by any means, but there are a lot of differences that makes a comparison between any countries’ approaches to corona less than ideal. 

For example, one of the biggest contributors to the large initial spread in Sweden compared to the neighbours is that a large number of Swedes go on holiday in the Italian alps during winter holidays in February. So just when the virus started spreading in Italy, thousands of Swedes were on holiday in the very epicentre of the first spread. Norwegians tend to go to their own mountains for skiing holidays and in Denmark skiing isn’t that big. So Sweden started out on a far worse plate and got a large spread before we really understood what this illness really is.

One could argue that an early lockdown might have contained the spread better, but you could also compare Sweden’s figures (deaths/100000 citizens) to countries that had extremely strict lockdowns (for example Italy) and you will find that the numbers or curves doesn’t differ that much.

I have also seen a lot of people accuse Sweden’s approach for being “experimental” and “untested”, which simply isn’t true. Sweden has followed a plan for pandemics agreed upon by health officials in most European countries before Corona. If it is the best plan is not for me to say, but it has not been “experimental”.

I personally think that there have been failures in the Swedish system, mostly due to politically motivated changes in the care of the elderly that proved very bad once corona struck and has become a large contributor to the catastrophic spread in nursing homes. 

I wholeheartedly agree that other countries should not follow Sweden’s approach, but follow an approach that works best for the situation in their own populace. But I also think it is very unfair to compare Sweden to our immediate neighbours or to bash us as a “hell hole” without understanding the actual situation or the underlying factors that contributed to those numbers. Let’s instead celebrate that we, and many other countries, have a better control over the situation today and hope that the entire world will be able to overcome this terrible times.",,/r/europe/comments/jf8l8u/the_ecdcs_new_coronavirus_map_showing_the_rate_of/g9k07mm/,Ennaia,1603298133

When the south slavs moved to the Byzantine empire, they were settled along the recently depopulated northern borders because the Huns did the Hun thing of enslaving everyone and massacring those that weren't worth it.

So the Villages have been one of the first places where southern Slavs (which would later become Serbians, Croatians etc, you are Serb, you know, I am just saying it for everyone else :) ) would be settled literally a millennia and a half ago. Thus there are a ton of names, places etc that still have either slavic names or slavic routes and the very name ""zagorochoria"" is evidence of that with the first half being Slavic and the 2nd being Greek.

This is what Biden [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-06/biden-s-scorn-of-saudis-is-a-warning-shot-after-trump-s-embrace) about SA:

&gt;The former vice president has described the kingdom as a “pariah” and threatened to stop the arms sales that make Saudi Arabia the U.S.’s top purchaser of weapons. He’s also signaled more willingness to engage with Iran, the kingdom’s archrival, and he’d probably work for a negotiated two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict while essentially abandoning the Trump administration’s widely-panned efforts.

You can read more about it [here](https://www.forumarmstrade.org/2020_biden.html), for instance:

&gt;Biden explicitly supports ending arms sales and military support to the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. He has favored withdrawing military and other support.

Biden will end the forever wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East, which have cost us untold blood and treasure.

The transcripts are available online. There's plenty of literature (not just Yugoslav) about it. The trial wasn't any worse than what was done across Europe at the time, and there was no doubt about his guilt.

&gt; Why should I notice it? Trying to overturn convictions of German war criminals would be social suicide. Of course nobody tried that.

It's not like those people don't have relatives, or there's a shortage of fascist organisations (even in Serbia) that could try, they might even try some day. But they have absolutely zero chance of success. No Serbian court will rule that Löhr was unjustly executed, regardless of the technicalities.

What you need to understand here is that the people who are now in power in Serbia, i.e. the people who appoint judges, are political descendants of Chetniks. The new judgment is no less political than the old one, but it's more unjust because it exonerates a clearly guilty war criminal. And there's no two ways about it, if he wasn't convicted, he's legally innocent.

&gt; Why?

Because no Serbian court will rule that whatever municipality has to remove a monument that they put up to a person who hasn't been legally convicted of anything, and is considered a hero by a large chunk of the ruling elites,",,/r/europe/comments/jetyxr/20_october_1944_the_red_army_and_titos_partisans/g9jl4yh/,7elevenses,1603290681

3458,"&gt;And Turkey being more progressive than the UK?!? What a joke this sub has become.

On an economical basis, Turkey *was* more progressive. UK growth rate, as I see [here](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/7483/economics/the-uk-economy-in-the-1930s/), was around 4 percent, whereas Turkey’s was over 9%, as I see from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_Turkey). Detailed:

&gt; Turkey's economy recovered remarkably once hostilities ceased. From 1923 to 1926, agricultural output rose by eighty-seven percent, as agricultural production returned to pre-war levels. Industry and services grew at more than nine percent per year from 1923 to 1929; however, their share of the economy remained quite low at the end of the decade. The government stepped in during the early 1930s to promote economic recovery, following a doctrine known as statism. Growth slowed during the worst years of the depression, except between 1935 and 1939 when it reached six percent per year.

3501,"Yes, it was more than just that in Poland. Poland and the USSR were enemies before the war. Their enmity went centuries back, with the last few episodes including Russia splitting what was rest of Poland with Austria and Prussia, and Poland invading the USSR in 1919 and annexing a big chunk of territory that didn't have a Polish majority.

Still, the Warsaw uprising was nothing at all like Yugoslav partisans. It wasn't a fighting force that had 4 years of battle experience and controlled big chunks of liberated territory. The Soviet could have and should have helped it, but they couldn't leave the Polish-German front to them, like they left the Yugoslav front to Yugoslav partisans.

3524,"&gt;BERLIN (inn) - A series of events at the Berlin Art Academy Weißensee is currently causing outrage. As part of the online program ""School for Unlearning Zionism"" (School for Unlearning Zionism) lectures, film evenings and discussions were planned in an art gallery belonging to the university throughout October. The events have titles such as: “The Challenge of Zionism - Alternative Paths for Israel / Palestine”, or “Colonial Knowledge Management - Appropriation, Looting and Deletion of Archives in Israel / Palestine”.

&gt;After the Israeli distribution newspaper ""Israel Hayom"" made public that four of the Palestinian speakers were close to the anti-Israel boycott campaign BDS , the art college withdrew funding from the series of events and canceled all events. The reports the ""Deutschlandfunk"". Reports that funds from public funds flowed into the project were denied by the university. A written statement also states that “dealing with different political and social positions without thinking bans” is part of scientific and artistic training. Furthermore, the university does not check the speakers for their personal and political attitudes.

&gt;Broad criticism

&gt;The Israeli embassy in Germany also expressed criticism of the events: “There should be no tolerance of the delegitimization of Israel and anti-Semitism in Germany today. Hosting a workshop whose title already negates Israel's livelihood is an embrace of anti-Semitism. ""

&gt;The former member of the Bundestag, Volker Beck (Greens), told “Deutschlandfunk”: “I think this event is a propaganda monstrosity. I don't think that the German taxpayer should finance something like that. Nevertheless, such an event is to be accepted within the freedom of expression. But it is not worth subsidizing. ""

&gt;The master class student at the Weissensee School of Art, Jehudit Jinhar, cannot understand the excitement. For many artists, critical examination of the official narratives of Israel is only possible after they have left their homeland. “It has become so absurd that, as a Jewish-Israeli woman, I have to assert myself as a non-anti-Semite to a German institution when I question Israeli politics. I mean, this is a research project, we don't know how it all ends. We only know what we have been taught, our history, which at some point simply no longer carries alone. ""

The EP has about the same potency as a eunuch, they almost never do anything but toe the line and will certainly not scupper a deal with the UK of petty issues. 

A deal pretty much unlocks the problems caused by the IMB, it opens up landing zones that both sides can live with - it does not preclude an agreement by itself.

There will very likely a deal, it will require compromises on both sides and that will include the UK removing the offending clauses from the IMB as part of a grand bargain.

Macron is all fart and no shit, he's posturing and that should be clear to anyone (no one in their right mind can possibly buy his nonsense about no-deal being better for French fishermen than a deal, even one on the UK's terms).

I believe there's barely any proof at the moment. The police must be collecting evidence as we speak to conclude their investigation.

If 15 people get arrested it is probably on the grounds of indications of wrongdoings or if they resist being questioned (ie they do not cooperate, though police has grounds to know that these people know something, OR if they do not show up to an appointment at the police station once they've been cited). People don't get arrested to be questioned as witnesses/bystanders.

So although - and I agree with your statement - there is no proof of a conspiracy to commit murder, things seem to be pointing in that direction. I suspect that even if it is not conspiracy to commit explicit murder, there's probably hints of a sort of network that facilitated the act, even if the people involved did not know what specific acts the assailant would commit.

Published

    1 day ago

media captionRallies in Paris, Toulouse, Lyon and other French cities in support of Samuel Paty

Four school students are among 15 people who have been taken into custody in France following the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty, who showed controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to his pupils.

The other detainees include four family members of the killer, a father at the school and a known Islamist radical.

Police carried out some 40 raids on the homes of suspected radicals on Monday and more raids are expected.

The brutal killing has shocked France.

Tens of thousands of people took part in rallies across the country on Sunday to honour Mr Paty and defend freedom of speech. A ceremony paying tribute to Mr Paty, who was 47, will be held at the Sorbonne University in Paris on Wednesday.

Samuel Paty, a well-liked teacher, had been threatened over showing the cartoons

A man named as 18-year-old Abdoulakh A was shot dead by police on Friday after killing Mr Paty close to his school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, a north-west suburb of Paris.

What's the latest from the investigation?

Four school pupils who may have helped identify Mr Paty to his killer in exchange for payment have been detained, a judicial source told the AFP news agency on Monday.

This brings to a total of 15 the number of people taken into custody in the aftermath of the murder.

The killer's grandfather, parents and 17-year-old brother were detained shortly after the gruesome attack.

The father of a pupil who reportedly launched an online campaign against Mr Paty and a preacher described by French media as a radical Islamist were among six people arrested on Saturday. Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin accused the two men of having issued a ""fatwa"" against the teacher.

People have laid flowers in tribute to Samuel Paty outside the school where was murdered.

The dozens of raids on Monday targeting suspected Islamist radicals were not necessarily linked to the investigation into Mr Paty's murder.

But Mr Darmanin said police would be interviewing about 80 people who were believed to have posted messages in support of the killing.

""We want to harass and destabilise this movement in a very determined way,"" an interior ministry source told AFP.

The government also said it was probing 51 French Muslim associations. It said if any were found to be promoting hatred, they would be closed down.

One organisation, the Collective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF), was labelled an ""enemy of the state"" by Mr Darmanin.

The organisation, which monitors anti-Muslim hate crime in France, has accused the minister of slander after he claimed the group was ""obviously"" involved in Friday's attack.

In a statement following news of the attack, the CCIF expressed ""our pain and our sadness to the family of this teacher"".

Why was Samuel Paty targeted?

Anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-François Ricard said Mr Paty had been the target of threats since he showed the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a class about freedom of speech earlier in October.

As he had done in similar lessons in recent years, Mr Paty, a history and geography teacher, advised Muslim students to leave the room if they thought they might be offended.

Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad can cause serious offence to Muslims because Islamic tradition explicitly forbids images of Muhammad and Allah (God).

The issue is particularly sensitive in France because of the famous publishing of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad by satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. A trial is currently underway over the killing of 12 people by Islamist extremists at the magazine's offices in 2015.

    Watch: Violence and hostility inside the French police

Some French-Muslims say they are frequent targets of racism and discrimination because of their faith - an issue that has long caused tension in the country.

What happened in Friday's attack?

Abdoulakh A is understood to have been an 18-year-old Chechen, born in Moscow, who had been living in the Normandy town of Évreux, about 100km (60 miles) from the murder scene. He had no known links to either Mr Paty or his school.

Mr Ricard said that the killer went to the school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine on Friday afternoon and asked students to point out the teacher.

The suspect followed Mr Paty as he walked home from work. He then used a knife to attack the teacher, before beheading him.
media captionJean-Michel Blanquer: ""What happened is beyond words""

Witnesses are said to have heard the attacker shout ""Allahu Akbar"", or ""God is Greatest"".

When police responded to the scene and confronted him, he fired at them with an airgun. Officers returned fire, hitting him nine times. A 30cm-long (12in) blade was found close by.

Authorities said the man had been before courts in the past but only on minor misdemeanour charges.",Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/jexana/four_schoolchildren_arrested_after_identifying/g9iu5y1/,WimpieHelmstead,1603268950

There is no such law. For example, the government completely ignores Folkhälsomyndigheten when it comes to drug policy. They _could_ ignore it here as well.

Fortunately, they chose to to listen to the experts, unlike for example Norway which closed schools in spite of what their experts said. That's a few billions down the drain, but I guess money doesn't matter very much when you have that oil fund.

Problem is, admitting that allowing mass migration was a dreadful mistake would naturally lead to the question ""Well, what do we want to do about it?"" And no one wants to go there, not even the right, because the answer to that question would imply a departure from the current set of ""we are all brothers and sisters"" values, and someone would start screaming ""HITLER!"" before you've even finished the sentence.

Then, there still are many people who stubbornly put ideology before reality, and who really are convinced that ""the world will be as one"". They think that with enough love and patience, everyone will eventually join the fold, embrace contemporary, hyper-individualistic Western values, and become good citizens of the world, blessedly free of any group identity, just more faceless drones defined only by the company they work for, the entertainment they consume, and what gender they woke up as on that particular day. And if they *don't* want to become a part of our ""utopia"", well, we'll just love them more until they see the light. And these people vote.

Then of course there's that thing with Saudi Arabia, which is playing an active role in all this e.g. by funding mosques that promote their own radical branch of Islam, but we are never going to do anything about it because it would be bad for the economy, because it would upset Uncle Sam, because who knows what shady shit they are involved in and whose balls, or wallets, they have their oily tentacles wrapped around.

The EU regions with the highest shares of births to women aged 40 or more were concentrated over much of Ireland, Spain and Italy. High shares were also recorded, among others, in the capital regions of Greece, Hungary and Portugal.

In 2018, the Spanish region of Galicia recorded the highest proportion of live births among mothers aged 40 or more: its share of 12.9% was more than twice the EU average. Galicia was closely followed by the Italian island of Sardegna (12.4%) and relatively high shares were also recorded in two other Spanish regions: Principado de Asturias and Comunidad de Madrid (both 11.7%), as well as Lazio in Italy (11.5%).

 In contrast, just 2.2% of all live births in Východné Slovensko (Slovakia) and Prov. West-Vlaanderen (Belgium) were to mothers aged 40 or more, followed by two Dutch regions: Drenthe and Friesland, as well as the Bulgarian region of Severozapaden (all 2.4%).

It's not pride, so much as reality that I'm Dutch. As noted earlier, I was born and raised there, at least for a little while, and my father was [a Dutch citizen the day I was born](https://ind.nl/en/dutch-citizenship/Pages/by-birth-or-acknowledgement.aspx). 

Further, as a Dutch person, I don't have to **adapt** to the Netherlands, Ik ben tenslotte Nederlander. Unlike you, who seem to be an American trying to dictate to Europeans what their skin colour should be to be considered as such. 

&gt;  it’s virtually meaningless to change your nationality

I have never held another nationality, so there's nothing to change, dear lady. This is what you can't get through your cerebellum: 

I was born Dutch, raised Dutch, educated Dutch, and will die Dutch, whether that happens to be in Rotterdam, Eindhoven, Schiphol, Kerkrade, London, Barcelona, South Carolina, Boston, Cape Town, New York, or San Francisco, no matter what you or any other nativist says. 

Again, the year is 2020, not 1420. If you were born in the wrong year for your mindset, you need to change.

4026,"Battle of Kosovo is a picture-perfect copy of the Last Supper before the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. This parallel is something that even the non-religious Serbian mind is tightly holding to. I guess there is something in the story of betrayal-sentenced-suffering-resurection itself that would attract even a non-religious mind. In a substantial part Croats and Bosniaks were adherents to this mythos too, by which we should all resurrect (you can find yourself as a Polish in this part of the story too).

Now, while politicians couldn't continue and couldn't restore Tito mono-leadership during 1980 to 1990, I think that Milosevic diverted more to the restoration of pride in people through Kosovo. That was the first story with a religious connotation propelled in communistic Yugoslavia, and couldn't satisfy everyone. That's when persecution on religious bases started in Bosnia, and later in Kosovo but not on religious bases. (I'm mentioning here only acts of Serbia here, not acts in which Serbia was the victim)... - religion, a category which didn't make **a** difference between people during Tito.

You said, ""ask Bosniaks what they think"". The greatest writers of 20^(th) century on our language Ivo Andrić, Meša Selimović etc. come from Bosnia! Everyone helds them in the highest esteem. Bosnians often point out that they are ""bigger Serbians than Serbs themselves""! But poorly tying some politicians with some ""spiritual leaders"" in the span of 3-4 years in Bosnia did us wrong.

Indeed the Wikipedia article you linked begins by saying that the Italian architecture of the fascist period consists of several styles and trends, usually mixed up in a *vague notion* of ""fascist architecture"". It's obvious that there was some interference but one could almost say that it was fascism that adopted that style rather than the opposite. It's a pity because in Italy we have several beautiful modernist buildings, among them many by [Angiolo Mazzoni](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiolo_Mazzoni), that did not and still do not get the attention they deserve just because ""they are fascist"".

4157,"&gt; Well, if competency is an important factor, then you should certainly not care about us, like at all. Feel free to look up von der Leyens track record as Minister of Defence.

I say 'competent' for how the government is generally seen because that plays into the expectations. People generally view the German government as more or less capable without looking into the particulars, not as like a byword for incapable. There are some countries that may have similar economies and populations to each other but one may be taken far more seriously than the other, you know? In Germany's case, general competence elsewhere (or at least the appearance of it from looking outside, idk) makes the scandal-ridden military areas stick out all the more versus if Germany was chronically run by what was viewed as some sort of meme government in most other respects.

&gt; And nobody here would care that much about the US, if their military spending were purely for defense. But instead you use your military for power projection and invasions, you use military bases like Ramstein to control drone killings, from our soil, which is straight up unconstitutional. You mock us for our military budget, but then get pissed when we are going to spend more on EU manufacturers, rather than US manufacturers, making it clear you just bully us to buy more weapons from you.
&gt; It's the same deal with the Russian gas drama. You just want us to buy your fracking gas instead, which would have to get shipped over the entire ocean, in a time where we need to drastically reduce emissions.
&gt; So yeah, it is clear the US does not care about defending us, but just about their own potential profit. I find this more than just hypocritical, considering that the US is the only country to ever invoke article 5.

I want to make clear that I did not make this or the last post to criticize Germany, discuss the merits/disadvantages of Nordstream, and so on. I am saying that the reason Germany is ""even always the target"" in a European context is because it's a relevant and influential country that some people have expectations of. Those expectations cannot all be met; German politics is not and cannot be calibrated to please the contradictory expectations and wishes of all people from the other countries it holds influence over in addition to the desires of the people in Germany. So long as Germany matters to people they will talk about what they think of it whether you invite them or not, just as you took the time out of your day to freely share with me your own thoughts and expectations about America.",Mississippi,/r/europe/comments/jeaawj/nato_defense_spending_by_country/g9huei1/,sparkling_uranium,1603241723

4173,"&gt; the war between Portugal and the Ottomans in India was won by Portugal

Except it wasn't.

&gt; You kinda did, when you claimed that Portugal had never imposed itself vis-à-vis Castille in the 1400-1600 period, which it did unequivocally in the first half of that period.

You keep saying this but they won one defensive war. That's not imposing your will. 

Portugal was unable to accomplish their goals of getting Juana to the throne during the War of Castilian Succession. They gained the South Atlantic but 20 years later signed the Treaty of Tordesillas giving Castile the majority of the Americas. Why didn't they just march into Castile, impose their will on them and take everything?

&gt;(which was successful: Cochin, Mumbai, Aden, straight of Hormuz, straight of Malacca, etc, and continued to be largely successful even after Ottoman intervention). I propose you read some History first.

If they had the power to do it, they would have taken more territory to better control the land routes to Europe, but they didn't. They couldn't hold any Ottoman mainland territory like Basra which they wanted to do. 

&gt; So then you agree that Portugal was the hegemonic European power in Sub-Saharan African in 1400-1600. Why didn't England or the Dutch do it?

Because Portugal was in an advantageous spot in Europe to get there first. They were good navigators. That doesn't make you a superpower by itself. When England and the Dutch got there Portugal was unable to keep them out.

4202,"The main culprit of people dieing from covid early on was the lack of protective equipment issued for workers at elderly homes and hospitals.

Employees were told to go to work despite having symptoms without masks or enough cleaning supplies, thus the virus could spread unchecked amongst those who were at their weakest.

As of right now the total death toll for people under 70 years of age is 462 men and 169 women (counted as people who tested positive for covid at the time of death)

As such the rest of the dead being over 70 years of age with nearly 3000 deaths being in the age group 85+ does paint a different picture than what people wants you to believe about how Sweden is handling the virus in my opinion.

The failure in Sweden is not the lack of a lockdown or heavy handed measures but rather adequate supply stockpiles for a crisis like this, the failure happened at an early point in the outbreak, it is not an ongoing chain of failures as now when supplies are plentiful Sweden is morbidly enough experiencing less deaths than an average year and has been since June.

Thus in my opinion a lockdown would not have changed any number of dead as nurses still would have needed to care for elderly without proper equipment (the alternative would have been to let them starve to death I guess).

This is a catastrophe that the Riksdag has been stoking since the fall of the USSR and subsequent dismantling of the civil defense stockpiles, it will still take many years for Sweden to reach an adequate level of preparedness.

4214,"&gt;I guess it’s imaginable, but not really realistic. Like a combination of China and the Cayman Islands? Not to mention that the UK has historically invested far less in state aid than its EU neighbours.

I didn't think it was realistic either until it became an issue for negotiations, then the UK's approach to tearing up the withdrawal agreement demonstrated a viciousness that I didn't expect to see in a modern, Western government.

&gt;   Most people on here seem to be laying the blame for any hindrances to the negotiations on the UK side..

4225,"&gt;I agree it's not a perfect solution - but it's a signifier of the UK's approach to employment rights and I haven't seen anything from the current cabinet suggesting this attitude will change in the future.

That attitude would seem to be to allow workers some degree of choice, that's a positive right as far as I'm concerned. I'm far more worried about what the UK government has done in terms of limiting collective action tbh (but obviously it did that while in the EU and pales in comparison to what was done in response to the 2008 crash in parts of the EU, with EU support..).  Either way, I can't see UK worker protections falling below the levels they are now, never mind falling below EU minimums, they aren't something that exist because of the EU after all (but rather years of struggle by the Labour movement and workers..)..  And as you pointed out, the EU is unlikely to be that bothered.

&gt;The free flow of goods is one of the four freedoms of the EU and it's not reasonable for the conservatives to seek it without some sort of regulatory alignment. 

The UK isn't looking for an entirely free flow of goods though (no quotas and no tarris get close, but it's not the same thing at all..). Getting close to that is however  also essentially what the EU seeks in all of its trade agreements, and what the WTO exists to facilitate. The level of regulatory alignment required varies with how free you want that flow to be, and again, in a UK/EU context, non-regression seems to be a pretty solid base (it'd mean that barriers arose if, as and when the UK and EU diverged..).

&gt;This is not something the EU has ever offered any advanced nation - let alone one on it's doorstep. I don't think it's a weak argument - the UK is very integrated with the EU economically.

The scope of the regulatory alignment that the EU was asking for was utterly unprecedented though.  If you look at the UK/Japan agreement, or indeed the EU/Canada agreement you can see that you can get most of the way there without anything approaching dynamic alignment. And again, the EU seems to have accepted that in stepping well back from that demand.

&gt;The UK currently doesn't lean towards selective state aid or unfair competition at the moment (outside of backrooms at least) - and if they weren't planning to immediately change I doubt it would be a sticking point in negotiations.

It seems to be though, although the official sticking point seems to be that the EU wants the UK to publish a framework for state aid rather than anything specific. I doubt that that isn't resolvable though, I do wonder if the pressure on the EU is partially the issue there now though, the EU has been pretty clear it wants to see EU level market interventions for example.

&gt;It's a complete non-issue on both sides for newspapers to chew on that I honestly feel could be solved in a few hours if the more important issues were solved.

You'd think, but honestly I think it has the potential to be the thing that sinks this if only because of the French election and the fact that there isn't really a way for the EU to retreat from its current position without appearing to give massive amounts of ground. I sort of assumed that they might jump at the three year transition offer from the UK, but beyond that it's politically lethal while being both economically inconsequential (well, except to those fishing communities..) and symbolically massive.",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/jerbo7/no_more_trade_talks_unless_eu_changes_position/g9hfa4d/,-ah,1603233167

4264,"&gt; Yes, but looking at this map people could think “Sweden and Ukraine are much better at climate change than Russia.”, while the reason their colours are paler is importation of CO2-intensive goods and fuels from Russia.
&gt; 
&gt; If other countries didn’t burn natural gas, Russia wouldn’t extract it, reducing total emissions despite the action being in “cleaner” countries.

I'm pretty sure that burned gas is considered at the place of consumption. Russia just uses a ton domestically too, in addition to the losses of the extraction process.

But the essence of the imported emissions concern is that the exporting country controls almost all options to reduce the emissions, ranging from a tax on exports to a total ban on exploitation. Whereas the receiving country really only has the option of reducing consumption, which is a good idea of course, but really skips a lot of options that could serve just as well.

The mostly unilateral engagement of the US in the middle East and America's ""failure"" to form a unified coordinated strategy (Bush ""started"" it, Obama ""tried"", Trump demolished it) has left a gigantic power vacuum in the area around the mediteranean/black sea which Russia (among others) has successfully exploited.

4283,"Yes you are right I did misunderstand what you were saying here, I’m sorry but in my defense, some people on Reddit sometimes have really strange ideas, and people get often confused by the use of regional languages (dialetti) in Italy. 

Anyway yes, you are pretty much spot on. 

For most of the middle ages, people used Latin in the administration of cities and formal documents. However, around the 1200 poetry in vulgar starts to blossom. In 1176 before the Legnano battle and the rebellion of the Lombard League, we can see in Italy some of the early poems in Vulgar, but not in the idioms of the Italian cities, but rather in langue d’oc, in fact for a long time there was the perception that certain languages, simply had less literary value than others. This was the case for a long time, but then certain Italian languages, Siciliano first and Fiorentino later acquired prestige, and were perceived to be “appropriate” for poetic writing. Venetian never really managed to establish itself as a literary language in the middles ages. From 1300 forward Fiorentino acquires more and more prestige first thanks to literary merit and later thanks also to the politics of the Medici that were looking to acquire more cultural prestige for Florence. In between 1400/1500 people start introducing more and more Tuscan words in their Latin writing and in 1500 the conversion to Italian is almost complete, [here] (https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Q06CIFiHA9EC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=lingua&amp;f=false)  is a collection of relations from Venetian ambassador and functionary that can help you look at the transition between Latin and Italian. In late 1500 the transition is basically complete and Venetian ambassadors write in an Italian that is really similar to our, nowadays, [here] (https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2wJUGyiIvMEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=oltramontani&amp;f=false) are some samples. However, in the meantime Venetian literature does develop, ironically it reaches its highest peak when the city had already turned mostly to Italian. In 1700 Italian is pretty much the de facto official language of the Republic and it has substituted Latin almost entirely. The correspondence of the period is all in Italian, even among family members, suggesting a widespread use in the cultural and educated elites. However, a lot of people kept speaking Venetian in their daily life, and writing poems and plays in Venetian keeps being quite popular. Most educated people would have been able to speak Italian, but that was not the case for the rest of the population that as you said learned Italian with the advent of Television. 

I wouldn’t say the one of Venice was really a compromise, in the sense that the choice was between Latin or Tuscan and not Venetian and Tuscan. Venetian was simply not an option on the table in 1500 during “La Questione della Lingua” and no Venetian intellectual proposed it even though the Venetian were pretty much dominating that debate. Trissino from Vicenza suggested courtly Italian and Bembo from Venice Fiorentino.  Is not even quite clear if intellectuals of the time thought Venetian and Tuscan were two different languages (now we know that is the case because of the development of linguistic taxonomy), but at the time Trissino seemed to believe they were two varieties of the same language (however his definition of language is a bit dubious), that view is echoed by the testimonies of Venetian such as Zuan Battista Giustiniano, while Machiavelli strongly insists that they are not the same language. What we know for sure is that their perception of what constituted a language was a bit different from us.

&gt;My understanding is that decision wasn't an easy one and was acknowledged as a tradeoff to come together as an Italian state (of course this was administrative, and I should think Venetians continued to speak venetian for a long time).

I think this is what confused me, I know where you are coming from, but I think is still a bit inaccurate. In the sense that Italian became the official language of Venice way before the idea of a unitary political state in Italy was even a thing, nation-states were not a thing back then, and even though cultural elites (it was quite different for the average farmer) did identify collectively as Italians, no one perceived the need for a unitary state. If you read medieval texts (Marin Sanudo) you will find often the concept of being a “good Italian” or “doing the good of Italy”, but with those things they meant trying the preserve the status quo and the serenity of Italy in front of foreign armies and then going back fighting each other’s later, they weren’t seeking further political integration, at least not in the way we mean it today. There were attempts at confederation of armies to confront the foreign enemy, like the League of Cognac, but they were quite often a failure. However, after the French revolution,  ideas such as people's sovereignty and self-determination became really widespread, and being a “good Italian” suddenly meant something else, and I guess the rest is history. 

Anyway, I like Alberto Angela too 😊 , can I suggest you also another good Italian historian, if you don’t know him yet, is name is [Alessandro Barbero] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l83UQkd6Wgs) and he is pretty cool.

4355,"There were a huge amounts of massacres against the Greeks during that age. Some of the most well-known ones were:

[The Constantinople massacre of 1821
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople_massacre_of_1821)

[The Chios massare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chios_massacre)
with 50,000 deaths.

[The Destruction of Psara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_Psara)

[The Kasos Massacre]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasos_Massacre)

The massacre that followed the [Third Siege of Missolonghi
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Siege_of_Missolonghi), where the Turks beheaded 3000 people and displayed their heads on the walls, while the rest of the people that were not excecuted or did not commit suicide were sold as sex slaves.

And many many more before and after the revolution. Yet Turks today insist that the Ottoman empire was a tolerant and peaceful empire that treated its citizens equally.

As for further massacres, what held the Turks from completely exterminating the remaining Greek populations of Anatolia (something that they did anyways 100 years later), was the fact that doing so would throw into rebellion ALL greeks across the empire, which were a sizeable portion of the population, and the fact that Russia had declared itself as protector of Orthodox Christians.

Remember, a lot of Greeks like the [Phanariots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanariots) were initially against the revolution since it would endager their lives and wealth. When the Turks started commiting the massacres, it made most wealthy and influential Greeks to join the revolution, and they were a huge factor that provided funding and ships to the rebels.

Commiting further massacres would also give the Russians a huge casus belli against Turkey (which is exactly what they were looking for), and no western power would oppose it since there was a massive wave of [Philhellenism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philhellenism) in the west.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/jeprx4/on_this_day_in_1827_the_battle_of_navarino/g9gz388/,Tairoth,1603226123

4396,"\&gt;&gt;People make The Soviet Union som saint in WW2. They were not. They were  murdered and occupiers who raped and ravaged the countries they  ""liberated"". &lt;&lt;

Yes. Totalitarian Soviet regime commited numerous crimes against humanity - before WW2, during this war and after it. And Polish nation was very heavy affected by it, not only by Katyń massacre, and repressions in years 1939-41 and 1944-45, but also by earlier ""polish operation of NKVD"" in 1937, during the Great Purge, when the Polish community in USRR was destroyed by stalinist terror.

There is not a sane person today (maybe some crazy commies, or Rusian - soviet stalinist nostalgics - but both of them doesn't count as ""sane"" for me), who would claim that Soviets were ""saints"" in any sense.

But, all this doesn't change the fact, that the Third German Reich is responsible for executing ""project"" of genocide, unprecedented in the history of mankind. Nazis not only commited Holocaust and countless other horrific crimes during the war, they also planned to totally exteminate Slavic nations from Central and Eastern Europe after their ultimate victory - including Polish nation.

Soviet ""liberation"" brought political repression and unpopular communist regime, but saved us from  complete extermination, intended by Nazi Germany after war.

That's why for western democracies and for millions of people in Europe, Stalin was a lesser evil.

4487,"&gt; Difficulty probably correlates to desired accuracy. If we don't care for accuracy, the task becomes trivial: Just tax everything equally. This would obviously be unfair as it taxes low-emission products the same as high-emission products. 

That would be like VAT. It's great for the nation's budget, but it doesn't work as incentive for green policy because ""greener"" technologies and products aren't rewarded. 

&gt; We can improve accuracy easily by applying the tax on products of which we know quite well how much carbon is stored in them, such as coal, oil and gas, for example. This would still be unfair, but less. 

This is a step forwards, but again only counts the carbon in these products. It makes products with a lot of carbon in them more expensive than products with less carbon in them; so it works in that regard. But it doesn't provide an incentive for using more efficient technologies, refineries, ... as these won't be accounted for. 

By all means, it's not an easy issue to solve. I quite like what europe has done with its ETS so far. Especially the start of each phase has been abit rocky; but I think it has shown clear results i.e. : [https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/emissions-trading-viewer-1](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/emissions-trading-viewer-1)

For many industries, we have a EU-wide carbon tax. I think some products from out of the EU market are subjected to duties to level the playing field. So we have ""accurate"" measurement at a plant level within the EU; and blanket product-based taxes for certain products that are imported. 

But i'm hopeful the ETS system gets expanded to more industries and -preferably- the market as a whole. So including consumers that use gas boilers, fuel, ...

And hopefully, other nations outside of the EU adapt similar measures so we can connect these carbon trading systems so the taxes are more fair; and work better to reduce emissions.",,/r/europe/comments/jelyiy/co2_emissions_in_europe/g9gjcir/,Etheri,1603219052

4514,"&gt; Some country's law? Propably not. 

Yes, some country's law. But that national law *has to be in compliance with EU law*. That's how the EU works. And that's what each and every Member State signed up for. If you don't agree with that, you do not deserve to be in the EU.

But the rule of law is about [more](https://worldjusticeproject.org/about-us/overview/what-rule-law) than just the law and some EU countries really do not meet [the bare minimum](https://worldjusticeproject.org/rule-of-law-index/) to be allowed in the EU. And as long as the EU doesn't do anything about it, nothing will change.

&gt;Then who would make it, and who would control lawmakers not to make some stupid decistions that would be hurtful.

EU law is made by the European Commission in cooperation with the - democratically elected - European Parliament and the Council of Ministers:

&gt;The European Commission (the EU’s civil service) is responsible for drafting and proposing legislation.
&gt;
The European Parliament (elected by EU citizens) and the Council of Ministers (representing national governments and attended by national ministers) amend the draft proposals and vote on whether these proposals should become EU law. National governments and the European Commission are then responsible for seeing that those laws that are passed are then implemented. The two most common forms of EU legal act are regulations and directives. Both regulations and directives are legally binding, and both are applicable to all 27 countries of the EU.

The lawmakers are (partly) controlled by EU citizens themselves (by choosing representatives in the EP).

&gt;And should we people trust some mostly not well known eurocrats to make good law.

You can ask the same thing about any *national* government, and yet we trust them. As a matter of fact, according to a recent [poll](https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/01/30/poles-trust-eu-the-most-and-government-the-least-among-institutions-finds-poll/), Polish people trust EU institutions *more* than their own government.

&gt;Sounds like good idea that can go terribly wrong.

It really doesn't and, apparently, 77% of EU citizens agree.

Equality doesn't mean everyone has the exact same, the point is giving everyone comparable opportunities and securing a dignified life for everyone regardless of merit.

Large inequality also severely harms a democratic political system, as the wealthy are much more capable of influencing representatives and the political discourse for their benefit, which usually opposes the will and well-being of the majority.

As for possible measures against inequality, if we want to stay very moderate we could implement property taxes, increase inheritance and stock taxes, reform the antitrust laws to be stricter, and demand businesses to participate their workers in terms of profits and decisionmaking. The additional tax income would be spent on various public services, like affordable/free public transport, hospitals and sustainable energy production. Thanks to profit participation, workers would have higher income, which would further reduce inequality a bit.

4780,"The European Union, as part of its efforts to provide funding for pandemic recovery, has in one stroke made itself a major force in the euro bond markets. There’s a big new beast on the debt circuit.

The bloc wants to raise up to 100 billion euros ($118 billion) to help pay for job support programs in Europe. It could have raised that twice over on Tuesday. Instead, the European Commission issued 17 billion euros of new social-linked bonds — known as SURE — at 10- and 20-year maturities. **Demand was incredible, topping 233 billion euros ($275 billion). That’s a record for any European bond, despite the negative yield on offer for the 10-year debt and the barely positive yield on the 20-year.**

It shows the depth of demand for risk-free assets as this AAA-rated entity provides an excellent alternative to German Bunds, the benchmark for European debt (until now, at least). Foreign demand, particularly from central banks having to invest reserves in euros, will have been strong as these new bonds offer yields that are still 35-50 basis points higher than German debt, which is even deeper into negative territory.

It won’t hurt that the European Central Bank can buy up to half of any EU debt in its vast quantitative easing programs. Investors know there’s a backstop.

4938,"So if we're talking about the best interests of the child being a primary considerations, first of all we have to talk about financial well-being. In this case it doesn't matter when the father decides to reject the child support, because the biological father would start paying it at that point (legally enforceable by the state).

&gt; this convention gives primary to the moral right of the child to have a father

Specifically, it affirms ""*the right (of the child) to know and be cared for by his or her parents*"". As far as I understand from the article, the mother has custody of the child and sued for alimony after a divorce. This means that the man is already not acting as the father in this child's life. It doesn't make any difference to the child who is paying money to the mother.

If you want to argue that the man should be forced to care for the child regardless because he failed to meet an arbitrary deadline for an event beyond his own control, you're essentially arguing for forced labor by the non-biological father in this case. This is a complicated philosophical argument, but imagine that the police came up to you on the street tomorrow and they said ""you have to pay 50% of your income for 18 years starting today to some random child to ensure their well-being, or you go to prison"". It's an artificial scenario, but not one that is too dissimilar from the one we're talking about. Do you believe that in that case, you are morally obligated to pay that money?

This argument is actually a bit similar to arguments about abortion, because in both cases you are weighing the autonomy of an adult person against the well-being of a child.

5076,"&gt; So where's the dog meat in my hot dog? 

The name ""hot dog"" does not imply there is dog meat in it, as there has NEVER been dog meat in hot dogs.

&gt;And when will insidious terms such as ""coconut milk"" be banned?

It will not be banned. Se forementioned explanation.''

There has never been cow milk in coconut milk, so nobody expects there to be.

The fact that you think this is an issue shows you do not understand the subject.

&gt;No sane person is misled by ""vegan burger"" product labelling. 

I don't why you think this is about sane people or not.

Burgers traditionally contain meat, so some consumers would expect any kind of burger to contain meat. And that is against the rules. 

&gt;Some real talk: ""Burger"" has nothing to do with meat.

Yes they do, as they traditionally have contained meat in products called ""Burger"".

&gt;It describes a shape.

Your subjective understanding of the term is irrelevant, completely irrelevant, so please forget about that.

What matters is the understanding of the term among consumers in the EU as such, including 70 year old illiterates.

&gt;Etymologically speaking, neither ""sausage"" nor ""burger"" are related to terms for meat.

In case you forgot what the subject is, it is consumer protection and not etymology.

Many food produts have names whoose roors have different meaning than the conjuction of the roots used for a food product. 

You provided a nice example yourself, ""hot dog"". 

The term for the food item called hot dog has never meant a warm dog. It means a sausage inside bread. The conjunction has a different meaning than the element. 

The same as the expression ""he is a cold fish"". It does not mean that the person saying believes that the person un question is a fish imposting as a human.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/je2ata/eu_lawmakers_set_to_vote_on_fate_of_veggie_burgers/g9bundo/,Orange-of-Cthulhu,1603118348

Ah yes, because they threaten to go to war every single time someone does something against their interests, but when they’re being the aggressive ones everyone just sits there and twiddles their thumbs. Greece and Cyprus won’t exchange their rights to defend themselves in return for keeping Turkey appeased. 

I don’t see this hypocrisy that you speak of, so I’ll say it again. *Greece did not purchase the S-300, they inherited it to prevent a war*. It was a compromise. Turkey didn’t want the S-300’s stationed in Cyprus, and Cyprus didn’t want to return them to Russia since they already paid for them. So, a compromise was reached and the S-300’s were deployed on Crete. If you’re gonna sanction Greece for inheriting Russian equipment, go ahead and sanction Poland too for inheriting old MiG-29’s from the soviet era.

Turkey, on the other hand, willingly went to Russia to request to purchase these missiles. There was no one threatening war, Turkey did not make this decision under duress, it was an act of free will. As such, the Americans didn’t like this and got pissed off.

5164,"For references, the current carbon footprint of an average Frenchman is 11 tonnes per year. I don't know about other EU members but I feel safe in guesstimating that they're quite comparable.

Rough calculation : each of us needs to eliminate 380 kg each year, or 32 kg each month, or 1 kg every day for the next 29 years.

1 kg of CO₂ is emitted by the burning of half a liter of gasoline. Saving 0.5 l of gas seems easy enough, doesn't it ? Here, however, it means burning 0.5 l less than the previous day, day after day, for 29 years straight.

Of course, [our carbon footprint](https://www.pnas.org/content/107/12/5687) isn't made only of gasoline. It'as actually made of, well, almost everything that we do, own and are used to as being essential.

If you still wish to burn that half liter but compensate by capturing and and sequestering, here is a starter pack :

One kilogram of pure carbon dioxyde at room temperature occupies a volume of roughly ½ m^3, but, once diluted in the atmosphere at the average rate of 412 parts per million by volume, that means more than 200 millions of cubic meters of polluted air to be processed. That's *only the daily increment* for each of us, day after day, for the rest of our lives.

For comparison, the only period since 2015 where the worldwide emissions came close to such a rate was during the Great Confinement of march-april.

No. I am telling you that they are less aware that those economic difficulties are result of something that happened over thousand years ago. Seriously, do something about your text comprehension skills.

&gt; Still does not make it less of a fact.

That's irrelevant to topic of this exchange. I am not disputing whether it's fact.

&gt; That's your opinion. Thinking of history in this way is horribly short-sighted. Why exactly does it make a difference for you if it was 1 century ago or 5 centuries ago?

No, it isn't my opinion. Suffering from hunger and war is worse by than speaking  Portuguese instead of Lusitanian by any reasonable measure. And there is clearly difference between something that happened to my great-grandmother, whom I've met, than to my unknown ancestors in 16th century. If there was anything wrong with thinking of history this way, I am sure someone would brought it up when I studied history at university...

&gt; By your own logic, at each of these series of events people's complains are equally valid, which proves my point.

We aren't all people living at each of these series of events. We are us living now. Ancient Lusitanians complaining about Romans is more valid than Portuguese complaining it about it now and putting it on same level as damage done by Estado Novo.

No, these statements definitely exist. Your point?
