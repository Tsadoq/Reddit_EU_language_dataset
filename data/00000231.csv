French liberalism is rooted in the idea of a collectively emancipated and unitary citizenry.

Hmm.

https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/2974/unregistered-vessel-on-international-seas-legal-status-and-consequences

&gt;In addition to ships flying flags of convenience, some ships have no nationality at all. Ships without nationality, also called stateless, flagless, or unregistered vessels, undermine the law-of-the-flag regime. Because stateless vessels do not have a flag state, no state can exercise control over them on the high seas or provide diplomatic protection on their behalf. Ships can become stateless in a variety of ways. They may lose their nationality if they violate their flag state’s laws or do not comply with its requirements; their flag state may be unrecognized by the international community; or they may never register with any state. Furthermore, ships that sail under more than one flag, using one or the other according to convenience, are “assimilated” to stateless ships under UNCLOS. **Because stateless ships do not enjoy the protection of any state, some countries and scholars have asserted that any state can assert jurisdiction over them.** But, as discussed infra, a ship’s statelessness alone may not authorize such actions.

Interesting.  I wonder how many of these vessels are operating as stateless vessels.

EDIT:

&gt;Commentators agree that stateless vessel status is undesirable in the scheme of international maritime law. The registration of ships is essential to the maintenance of order on the high seas. As a result, a stateless vessel “enjoys no protection whatever, for the freedom of navigation on the open sea is freedom for such vessels only as sail under the flag of a State”. **Stateless status deprives a vessel of important privileges, such as the right to enter and leave territorial water and ports.**

1- They were invited by the Italian Nobility after fighting the Ottomans until Skanderbegs death, thus giving Italy enough time to prepare and fight

2- They were given their own areas to colonise by said Nobility where they still live. When the Ottomans attacked the coast they knowing them better than the Italians, led the fight and kicked them back to the Balkans

3- Arbereshe and their language/culture are protected by the Government.

4- They are more Italian then you having fought for Italy and never turning its back on the country that hosted them. They speak the local language perfectly and have played their part fighting in every major battle for Italy. What more do you want them to do?

There you go speaking out of your ass again. Would you like links to other countries Albanians have been living for centuries? I have Greece , Croatia , Ukraine , Egypt, Syria, Austria  and Bulgaria if you wish.

None of them mention violent culture or high criminality. They mention that they integrate well with the society, learn the local language and tradition whilst speaking albanian at their own home.

The answer is, despite what this sub wants to hear, not very much.  The new new figures for foreign investment are not at all out of line with typical swings from year to year, as can be seen by simply comparing the annual data over a ten year period or longer: [https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/foreign-direct-investment](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/foreign-direct-investment)

Set the graph to ten years and you can see that the current 'jawdropping' figures are higher or equal to at least a dozen other quarters in the last ten years. The only way you can make it significant is by not taking the figure itself and citing instead the drop relative to the previous year.  But a) the previous year was a record breaking year, largely due to some paper-shuffling mergers that technically showed up as tens of billions of investment, and b) even the drop from last year isn't some kind of unprecedented disaster.  It's smaller than the first quarter swing in 2014, for example.  Remember the chaos and devastation on the streets that caused?

784,"&gt; conclude that US is doing it so they can have oil for themselves which is nothing new tbh though

First, injecting oil into the world market decreases oil prices.  If the US wanted to import oil, it would want Iran to engage in the maximum amount of oil export possible to whomever.  The more supply to the global market, the better.

Second, US technological advancements permitting use of hydrofracking — that stuff that the EU has been banning — to extract more oil have made the US getting close to neutral on the net on oil (it is expected to be shortly).  This isn't the 1970s — the US largely can ignore oil producers today.

https://www.iea.org/weo2017/

&gt;A remarkable ability to unlock new resources cost-effectively pushes combined United States oil and gas output to a level 50% higher than any other country has ever managed; already a net exporter of gas, the US becomes a net exporter of oil in the late 2020s.
&gt;
&gt;In our projections, the 8 mb/d rise in US tight oil output from 2010 to 2025 would match the highest sustained period of oil output growth by a single country in the history of oil markets. A 630 bcm increase in US shale gas production over the 15 years from 2008 would comfortably exceed the previous record for gas.
&gt;
&gt;Expansion on this scale is having wide-ranging impacts within North America, fuelling major investments in petrochemicals and other energy-intensive industries. It is also reordering international trade flows and challenging incumbent suppliers and business models.
&gt;
&gt;By the mid-2020s, the United States become the world’s largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter and a few years later a net exporter of oil – still a major importer of heavier crudes that suit the configuration of its refineries, but a larger exporter of light crude and refined products.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8u9s93/us_pushes_european_and_asian_states_for_zero_oil/e1ds2g4/,vokegaf,1530112895

Serbia and Montenegro kept the Yugoslav name under ""FR Yugoslavia"" and FIFA and UEFA allowed them to retain the records and succession even though the UN didn't recognize them as the Yugoslav successor.

851,"&gt; Electric vehicles don't necessarily pollute less than gasoline cars.

They do. Much less, in fact. The pollution due to the production of the cars is similar; do you have any source that claim otherwise? And it is anyway dwarfed by the pollution produced by running the cars over years.

For some concrete numbers, consider the CO2 emitted by a modern, efficient gasoline car. It needs about 7l/100km, burning one litre of gasoline emits about 2.36 kg of CO2, and refining this gasoline in the first place emits about 0.6 kg of CO2, giving you 20.7 kgCO2/100km.

Now consider an electric car. You can easily get 100 km out of 16 kWh with a Zoe or an Ampera. (Teslas are less efficient, Ioniqs are more). Now consider that charging the battery has efficiency 0.8, and transmitting the electricity to the charging station 0.94. You need then to produce 21.3 kWh to get these 16 kWh in your battery. [On average](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920916307933#t0010), you emit 0.4 kgCO2/kWh in Europe. Which gives you a grand total of 8.5 kgCO2/100km.

So 20.7 kgCO2/100km versus 8.5 kgCO2/100km. It's a brutal difference.

This of course you if are talking about CO2 emissions. The pollution due to particulate material and other crap is also incomparably better, as it's emitted in the power plants and nor in the middle of the city where we live.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8u7wk6/european_carmakers_invest_seven_times_more_in_ev/e1djtjc/,araujoms,1530105362

901,"&gt; ... but I also don't want rapid change in my day to day life

And this is exactly what will happen to those Brits in the EU and EU nationals in the UK. It's not only the procedures which are just a hassle, but about people being openly asked by colleagues and ""friends"" when are they packing up to leave the country because the people have voted. This is not just about the bureaucratic complications, but about rapid changes to people's lifestyles because of how their neighbours start to behave. Not to mention the fact that many pro-Brexit regions have very low numbers of immigrants. 

But anyway, I can understand wanting to keep your neighbourhood, city, country the way the natives want it. I would totally support any national state measures to ask immigrants to learn the language, adhere to customs, restrict benefits for a fixed period all in the name of encouraging immigrants anywhere to integrate better. It's just that Britain had Little Arabia, and Little Turkey and Little Pakistan and Little Africa, and Little India long before they had Eastern European immigrants and they seemed to thrive in this cultural diversity. Yet somehow the Poles broke the camel's back and provoked this huge backlash. The EU allows any member state to make rules regarding the integration of immigrants, as long as you don't bar people from the start at the border crossings. Germany has language laws, and limited benefits and integration programs. This just wasn't harsh enough for the UK. Also, as you said, the bad judgement of British authorities regarding the travel rights for fresh EU states when they did not impose restrictions on new arrivals even though under EU laws they had the right to do so. The problem was with the British Government, not the EU. 

&gt;I must admit I don't read British tabloids, so I don't know what they are saying specifically.

[Here is a quick summary.](https://mic.com/articles/78953/uk-s-right-wing-media-manufactures-ridiculous-controversy-over-flood-of-25-romanian-immigrants#.4t9ptIuzb) Victimising Eastern Europeans was not my point however, just that the tabloids go for the emotional response in their readers, which just creates an equal and opposite response in the populations they target as the ""enemy"". If a big enough majority in the pro-Brexit crowd believe the garbage that was written, it's hard to not take it personally and adopt a view opposite theirs by default. 

&gt; Would you be as emotionally involved over that? I guess what I am asking here is: is it any country leaving a problem? Is it the country population size that is the problem? Or is it the fact that Britain has a bigger reputation because the world is English speaking now and they are a central part of that with links to the other Anglo countries?

The personal aspect would be lower for any non-UK country. My main gripe with eurosceptic views is that they blame the blunders of national governments on the EU regulations. My second gripe is that the vast majority of people don't know what exactly the EU does and does not do for them. They don't know about the scope of EU wide cooperation on less visible aspects like security, science, consumer safety, not to mention the benefits for Swedish business having access to the huge EU market. So I wouldn't support such drastic measures taken for misguided reasons. 

Generally I think any country is free to leave if that is the will of the people. I would find it a stupid decision however if the main arguments for leaving are based on lies and emotional responses to tabloid style ""news"". As long as the people are informed and a majority is convinced with hard facts that their interest lies outside the EU, I wish them all the best. Otherwise, leaving the EU won't solve shity national governments regardless if it's Brexit, Swexit, Grexit etc.  ",European Union,/r/europe/comments/8u1jsf/jawdropping_300_billion_negative_swing_in_foreign/e1debpm/,this_toe_shall_pass,1530097820

But some nationalities don't come to the other countries respecting their new country culture, rules and societal norms. They come to collect social welfare. When around 2050-60 Sweden DNA makeup will be dominated by more than 50% by migrants coming there from 1990+, then it could be serious issue. If children are propagated into welfare lifestyle, imho it's much harder for them to integrate and feel part of society - because they collect a lot and contribute a lot less, so it's always us vs Swedish state and their agents. 

If Sweden will have many people's with lifestyles like this, Sweden will degenerate both in safety, and well being of society. Idk if it's an issue already considering that I seen reports which conclude how unsafe some places in Sweden are becoming and how it's becoming increasingly worse, which means that current policies don't reach those people properly, or can't because this effect started to snowball (poverty and crime stricken in what's essentially is becoming ghettos, and good luck with that - ex.

Exactly, they were to represent Switzerland by they didn't. They represented Albania.

So in reality they don't really give a fuck about Albania as money is more important to them. In the case, they are even bigger cunts - offend other for no good reason because after all, Albania is not worth shit to them.

970,"&gt; The OECD estimated the yearly short-term fiscal impact of immigration to Germany was negative 1% of GDP.

These OECD estimates are from 2009, the Bertelsmann statistics are from 2014. Ironically, the difference might be explained by the arrival of *new* migrants paying more into the pot than 5-6 years ago; if you'd check your OECD source, it specifically points out that the negative value is a result of the majority of migrants the data was referring to now being old enough to draw pensions themselves, which would obviously skew the numbers.

In this, the Bertelsmann study is actually superior because it calculates *lifetime* contributions rather than how much migrants are paying in or receiving out of the pots at this specific point in time.

&gt; You are right to an extent but with automation increasing, for example so many checkout workers are going to be out of jobs soon, there is no reason to have such migration.

It seems a bit premature to phase out employees before their replacements are ready to fill this gap. And I was referring to nurses rather than doctors, by the way; there seems to be real concern with regards to so many vacant positions not being filled post-Brexit. Otherwise, the topic of using British prison inmates as replacement medical personnel would arguably have never popped up.

&gt; Capitalism is not based on infinite growth

Every time the economy stagnates, it gets bad for people. It's true that this is mainly a result of capitalists, as the first thing that tends to get cut when the economy looks bad is worker wages, which in turn kicks off a downward spiral where less money in peoples' hands means even fewer purchases made, but in an economy that lives in dependence of capitalists, these long-term consequences cannot be ignored.

In part, it's also plainly because people just get older and older as technology and healthcare improve and longevity increases, which, whilst cool, also means there is *always* an imbalance between people paying into society and people relying on it. It should easily be possible for the system to adapt and shuffle more money into those coffers to compensate, but since it means less money elsewhere, this is rarely done. It's not like the UK doesn't have the money to, for example, increase funding for the NHS, after all, it's all about choices on how to spend what you have.

(which was one of the Leave arguments as well, if you recall -- except that the fudged numbers, and the fact that Farage backtracked on where to spend the money the very next morning after the vote)

&gt;Britain could be fined millions of pounds if it tries to negotiate trade agreements with other countries before leaving the European Union.

&gt;The European Commission and other EU countries could take the UK to court if the Government begins talks with countries already in negotiations with the EU.

All those other countries that have signed deals with the EU have *also* agreed that they may not have any separate deal with individual EU countries.  
They either deal with the whole of the EU top satisfy EU law, or not at all.  

If they break that agreement, their own trade deal with the EU will suffer and they will face fines and penalties. Likely having goods rotting on docks while their respective governments sort things out.

Or freedom of movement with a larger continent means that unlike the other countries, you don't get to have a say over who comes in via those channels. Some, I imagine would answer with that.

I could also imagine some would answer about how the ECJ cannot be reversed, or how the EU parliament cannot propose laws like the parliamentary model used all over the world, so that might be the issue.

Perhaps the answer is something to do with signing your own trade deals that are concerned with just your interests.

In other countries than my own or the UK I imagine they might say something about controlling their own currency in order to control quantitative easing or set economic policy in their own countries.

In future citizens I can also imagine them saying something about setting their own tax rates and policy.

But ultimately I think there is just an idea with two opposing viewpoints, about the end game of this model.

1076,"So many issues with that statement it's hard to know where to begin. Firstly, a good number of remainers didn't vote because the result was widely predicted to be a landslide for remain. Likewise many votes were cast for leave as a protest vote, again due to remain's large expected margin of victory. Many more leave votes were cast on the basis of lies and misinformation from the ""vote leave"" camp (£350m for our NHS, anybody?).

There was also the extraordinarily ill-conceived nature of the referendum itself: the fact that it was held as a way for Cameron to score some political points, the fact that there was no threshold for voter turnout (so 2% of the population turning up and all voting leave would have been a ""win"" for leave despite 98% of the population not voting for that). There was the ridiculous game of realpolitik being played by, for example, Boris Johnson; giving ""leave"" an unearned air of legitimacy in order to cash in on the political value of future EU discontent. There was the total lack of a cohesive argument *pro* staying in the EU (not just anti-leaving or anti-Vote Leave) coming out of Vote Remain. The lack of any real discussion of what leaving would actually entail from either side (lies from Leave, silence from Remain). And last but not least was Corbyn's total and utter misunderstanding of what being a party leader entailed, or why he might have to actually act in line with the wishes of his party members, MPs, and constituents instead of some weird, Cold War era objection to the EU bloc.

It is different, because this is still going on in the present time. It is still a part of our school education. It is a fact that can be checked out easily. His opinion on the other hand is based on a decision made by people almost 80 years ago, who are all dead by now. I don't think i need to accept any historically grown feelings. It's much better to let some of them go in my opinion. Some are even damaging.

&gt; You explained something by pointing to your specific historic experience. From my perspective, I also do not think it's rational to be okay with your army falling apart, cause who needs an army anyway, right? but at the same time, I understand where this is coming from and I respect that because I can see in my own country how strongly the historic experience shapes our people's views as well.

And where is the problem? I agree to that, too. Pacifism is irrational. And i'm pretty sure i'd have chosen the ""use military"" option at this point. I just tried to explain where this survey-result is coming from and that you don't need to take it too personal.

&gt; Joining EU is another thing but whether people like it or not Turkey geopolitically and culturally has ties with Europe that can't be broken. Neither Middle East nor Eurasia as they are today can work with Turkey.

&gt; We never had a good relationship with Iraq, Syria, Russia however we were always fine with Europe, even today we're not choking each other despite Erdogan since our policies align which is the only thing that matters for NATO. 

Middle-Eastern countries haven't even completed their industrial revolution so far (except Israel and Turkey) so while establishing relations, this is something to keep in mind. Of course one should improve the region and raise the life quality in Middle-East but this can't be done without having to prosper yourself first, for which Turkey needs to keep good ties with EU and vice versa. So even from the conservative point of view, if one wants to see Muslim nations prosper and achieve good life standards, one has to be in good terms with Europe. A hostile stance will not make Middle-East prosper. Constant war is never good for development of the human mind. Middle-East has to get out of this mess as soon as possible.

&gt; The belly dancing in the last 5 years don't mean anything to people who are actually aware of this fact but most people are way too emotional and easily distracted/manipulated by the media. One of the most noticeable things you said is the fact that Turkey continues to work with EU, even if the government tried to stop relations tomorrow, it could not simply because the people are already very connected with each other on a professional level.

Turkey won't try to stop relations with the EU, at least not officially. Erdogan can say screw EU and all that to appeal to his voter base, but in reality, there isn't anything tangible to gain from abandoning relations. As I said, on the contrary, even if one dislikes EU (on professional/political level) and favors Middle-East, still in order to improve Middle-East, one has to keep good ties with EU. Investments, projects, etc, there is much to gain from keeping good ties with EU. 

Joining is another thing, which is not required vitally. It's enough for Turkey to increase the trade, get involved in projects and implement them. So do not get demoralized when Turkey is refused to be in the EU, this does not mean too much for now. Do not let people use ""They don't let us into EU! These are hypocritical fuckers!"" argument since we are doing a lot of things already which do not require EU membership.

1218,"A transgender woman has won a legal fight to force the government to pay her state pension from 60 after a European Court ruling.

The married woman, who cannot be named, could now be eligible for around £30,000 in back payments after the court ruled that the refusal to pay her pension at 60 was discriminatory. 

She was told she could not have it until 65, the men's state pension age, because she did not have a gender recognition certificate confirming her status as female. 

A devout Christian, the woman, now 70, was unable to obtain a certificate because under the law at the time doing so would have meant divorcing her wife or annulling the marriage.

She argued that she wished to stay married to her wife ""in the sight of God"".

She sued the Department for Work and Pensions for five years of state pension which she said she had unfairly missed out on because of the government's stance. 

The European court of justice ruled that the law is discriminatory as it  ""treats less favourably a person who has changed gender after marrying than it treats a person who has retained his or her birth gender and is married.""

Following the introduction of same-sex marriage in 2014, the law changed to allow transgender people to remain married and still receive recognition of their new gender. 

But this was not backdated, so there was no provision for people who had turned 60 before the law changed.

In a previous ruling Court of Appeal judges dismissed her application but said the woman was the victim of ""a real misfortune"" and said changes in the law had occurred ""too late for her to benefit from them"".

The case was referred to the Supreme Court which said it was split on the issue and asked the European court for guidance. 

The woman's lawyer, Jacqueline Mulryne of Arnold &amp; Porter, said around 100 other cases could be affected by the ruling with some of them currently waiting to be heard by UK pensions tribunals. 

In a joint statement with fellow lawyer Chris Stothers of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, she added: ""The court rightly recognised that the DWP’s treatment of our client, in requiring annulment of her marriage before recognising her gender and paying her pension, was directly discriminatory and could not be distinguished by the desire to avoid same sex marriage.

""The case now returns to the Supreme Court to apply the ruling, although we are hopeful that the DWP will apply the ruling and recognise our client’s gender without any further delay.""

A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ""We are carefully considering the implications of the Court of Justice of the European Union’s judgement and will await the verdict of the Supreme Court.""

1221,"&gt;Unless you're on board with the ""(((globalists))) want to replace the Whites of Europe and intentionally compromise policework"" idea, actual sentencing statistics show an opposing trend to this.

I'm not sure I'd go that far. But seeing as how Sweden's own PM called the cop's cover up of sexual attacks by migrants at music festivals a ""double betrayal,"" and seeing as how cops all over Britain covered for immigrant rape gangs for decades, and seeing as how Germany only admitted to the mass rapes in Cologne after social media pressure gave them no choice, I wouldn't exactly call it ""without evidence"" that many European authorities are now more interested in a multicultural narrative than in people's safety. 

&gt;Sentencings by offence also show a downward trend in almost every type of crime, sexual crimes and drug offences being the two exemptions. 

This is a non-argument. I'm not going to dig up all the articles of migrants being given lenient sentences for sexual crimes -- I'm sure you're well aware of them. So I would tread carefully while considering ""a downward trend in sentencing"" to be a good thing... But even if we accept your statement at face value, you admit, and even the craven current authorities in Sweden admit, a jump in certain crimes -- especially of a sexual nature. These are of course the crimes in which immigrant groups have proven themselves to excel. So then I wonder: when you say people are wrong to perceive the increase in crime. Do you mean Swedish women are wrong to feel less safe (which they observably are)? Or do you mean other Swedes are wrong for caring?

&gt; We were seconds away from broadcasting live from Lenin Square in Nizhny Novgorod ahead of England's World Cup match here, when two burly guys in their 20s approached us, drunk on life and heading home.

&gt; But what happened next amazed me.

&gt; They didn't jump on me, they didn't abuse me.

&gt; When the report ended they gave a thumbs up gesture and walked away smiling.

Not such a thing.

That's not to say that currency devaluation doesn't have negative consequences, but it also has positive ones. This is one of them.

Another reason this makes sense regardless of your position is that one of the outcomes that seems to be a given is that the UK will deregulate when we leave the EU. Obviously businesses like this, and it would seem they're investing in anticipation of that. This assumes, of course, that Labour don't win the next general election.

There is no such thing as ""normal levels"" of IQ across disparate groups. Each group has its own average. That is like suggesting a change of diet can lead to ""normal levels"" of height. Yes, normal for your phenotype. But Japanese people won't suddenly become as tall as the Dutch because they eat like them...

&gt;Malnutrition has a huge negative impact on brain development 

It does. But that can easily be controlled for and has been controlled for via adoption studies.

Modern IQ tests have zero cultural bias. Unless you are about to suggest that pattern recognition, reflex speed, and memory tests, are ""cultural."" In which case, you might as well say the very foundations of cognition are cultural.

You have no reason to talk because you realize now that you are out of your depth. Your counter arguments are non-existent. As for the author of your desperate blog post, who seems perplexed as to why UK blacks start out with average IQs, only to drop over time: this is because neural plasticity decreases with age, while genetic expression increases with age. Put another way: our environment has more control while we're young, but the genes take over as we get older. This is why programs such as head start in the US always show ""promise"" in the early (young) stages, only to regress to the mean.

1397,"&gt;Are there any studies regarding effect of proper vs lack of nutrition during development on intelligence? I'm think that maybe some of the IQ gap could be closed by this change.

There have been many such studies. And, unsurprisingly, severe malnutrition can create cognitive deficits. But one should not imagine that proves these gaps can merely be ""fed away."" Malnutrition can also lead to height deficits. But this does not mean that people all have the same genetic potential for height. In fact, a malnourished Dutch man will probably still be taller, on average, than a well nourished Japanese man.  

We've controlled for all these ideas via adoption studies. There is simply no evidence that giving kids better environments, better schools, and better food, can magic away their biology. Quite the opposite. Adopted children end up closer to their biological parents in regards to IQ and behavior, than to the parents who raised them and molded their entire environment.

I don't think that it was the norm either in this UK or elsewhere to call Yanks upstarts in 1945.

We were a *status quo* power in 1945.  Germany would have been the one seeking to radically reshape the balance of power in a chunk of the world (bring down the existing powers of France, the UK, and the Soviet Union, control large chunks of new territory and countries).  France, the UK, and the US were the big ""boring"", ""same old, same old"" countries.  The USSR wanted to take chunks of Europe for itself (and more-broadly, wanted world revolution).

EDIT: I guess arguably the UK would be more ""establishment"" than the US in that London also probably would have liked to halt the cracking of the British Empire, and that was well underway by that point.

1438,"I think that it would be *vastly* better to change it at the EU level than to start an EU-state power struggle (though politically that'd probably be wonderful for them).  But if I were trying to find a way to do it…what happens if the Italians amend their constitution to render part of the directive unimplementable?

As I understand it, EU law views EU law as superior to national constitutions.  That is, it would be a violation of EU law to not ignore a constitution in favor of EU legislation.  The EU demands that a directive be implemented or a state leave the EU.

But in national law, the member state (and thus its constititution) are superior to EU law.  When a treaty — and in national law, the EU remains no more than a collection of treaties — violates your constitution, the treaty is invalid.  You are bound to ignore the treaty — arguably, you don't even have authority to sign an unconstitutional treaty.

As I understand it, the way things have gone so far is that because this would basically force a constitutional crisis (I suppose that theoretically a member state could leave the EU and avoid violating either, though even then there's be a conflict until the leaving process happened), everyone has just avoided letting such a situation come up and backed away.

But if you're a party that aims to score political points via a running, noisy conflict with Brussels, that might look like a top-notch solution.

&gt;Laws amending the Constitution[7] and other constitutional laws must be adopted by each House after two successive debates at intervals of not less than three months, and must be approved by an absolute majority of the members of each House in the second voting. Said laws are submitted to a popular referendum when, within three months of their publication, such request is made by one-fifth of the members of a House or five hundred thousand voters or five Regional Councils. The law submitted to referendum cannot be promulgated if not approved by a majority of valid votes. A referendum is not to be held if the law has been approved in the second voting by each of the Houses by a majority of two-thirds of the members.

It [looks like they control an absolute majority in both houses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Parliament).

Second approach: modify national law to modify the *effect* of the directive.

Because the EU has this unusual structure where copyright is defined by national law and directives merely rely on definitions and rules in national law and place some broad limits on it, what happens if Italian law has internal changes to alter the effect of implementing the directive?

Like, what if Italy defines fair use (or the Italian equivalent) of copyright to permit use of copyrighted material in some cases, removing it from the question of copyright?

Like, if an EU state permits use of satirical material as fair use, I'm sure that it doesn't suddenly become restricted just because it happens to be in snippit form on a website.  If so, it should be easy enough to cut fair use holes precisely the size and shape of the new restrictions.

I dunno if these are good ideas, but when one starts saying that legal matters are simply *impossible* to accomplish, I get really skeptical.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8u02c4/italian_vicepremier_di_maio_against_eu_copyright/e1csmzn/,vokegaf,1530063564

I am pretty sure that that's not why it's essential.  If that were it, it'd still be negotiable.  Nothing essential about ""great thing"".

Free movement is essential to make time on the side of further integration.  And it's a form of integration that's generally acceptable, I think.  Even if you absolutely don't want federalization now, if your Finnish son marries a Greek's daughter and then the couple goes to live in Poland, are you prepared to try to *force* them never to lower the remaining barriers, if they see them as meaningless, even after you've passed on?  I wouldn't.  That'd be a stupendous dick move, I think.

If the UK gets it, other labor organizations in other wealthy EU members will also demand it because they want their own little protectionist bubble.

1647,"First of all, DF has never been in the government.

Second, you are right that my data was slightly wrong (I messed up copying), but the correct data shows exactly the same tendency. If you get the complete data (with decimals), you see the tendency:

- 1998: 7.4% Left-wing government. Next election, growth.
- 2001: 12% Right-wing government. Next election, growth.
- 2005: 13.3%. Right-wing government. Next election, growth.
- 2007: 13.9%. Right-wing government. Next election, decline.
- 2011: 12.3%. Left-wing government. Next election, growth.
- 2015: 21.1%

So DF grows with left-wing and right-wing governments. They grow with left-wing governments (2 out of 2 times), and they grow with right-wing governments (2 out of 3 times). They haven't stagnated since 2015 because there haven't been elections. In fact, the polls before the elections gave them a slightly worse result than they are getting now, 17.9% to 18%. You can see the results of the polls before the election [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_general_election,_2015) (the average of all polls is 17.9%) and the current polling [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Danish_general_election). If you live in Denmark, you probably know that DF has always done better than the polls suggested: the theory says that people don't want to admit they vote for them.

Of course, you can argue that DF has even more growth under left-wing governments. However, I don't think that this is related to changes in migration policy: the center-left and center-right in Denmark are very similar in regards to immigration. I would even say that under Mette Fredericksen (the current leader) SD is more anti-immigrant than Venstre (the center-right party). [Here](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/denmark/11680974/Denmarks-election-campaign-has-been-a-race-to-the-bottom-on-immigration.html) you have an article on The Telegraph talking about the 2015 Danish election and the anti-immigrant position of SD:

&gt; Ms Thorning-Schmidt [the social-democrat PM] set the tone for the campaign in her New Year’s speech, when she declared: “If you come to Denmark, you must of course work. You must learn the Danish language, and you must meet and mix with Danish colleagues.”

&gt; The government then brought in tighter immigration rules, making it harder to claim asylum and easier to send refugees back if the situation in their home countries improves.

&gt; Then when the campaign began, the slogan “If you come to Denmark, you must work” was plastered over buses around the country, since when Ms Thorning-Schmidt’s own rhetoric has got ever tougher.

&gt; ""Denmark is a small country and there are limits as to how many foreigners we can accept,"" the party says on its website under the headline, ""Foreigners: Tighter Asylum Rules.""

&gt; Michael Ulveman, former spin doctor for Anders Fogh Rasmussen, former Danish prime minister, believed these statements have gone a long way towards “neutralising” immigration as an issue.

&gt; “She’s stretching very far, I think as far as she possibly can when you look at her coalition partners,” he said. “It’s difficult for the voter to tell the exact difference between the opposition’s immigration policies and the government's immigration policies.”

Do you really believe that DF growth in 2015 was because Thorning-Schmidt was too soft on immigration? Seriously? As a Spaniard that lived in Denmark, I can tell you that Thorning-Schmidt (and the SD) would be considered far-right on immigration issues.",Catalonia (Spain),/r/europe/comments/8tiw3z/merkel_loses_support_far_right_rises_after/e1cd2v4/,gawyntrak,1530047999

Right, which is why as we all know the Romans and Greeks never practiced slavery before they adopted Christianity....wait...

&gt;and it destroyed their culture by trying to erase millenia of paganism

This part right here is just not true from a historical perspective. On the contrary Christianity actually borrowed alot of Pagan thought, practices and rituals into its organization and belief system.

Many of the rituals you see in Catholic and Orthodox mass are derived from Pagan rituals as an example. Christians also heavily respected many Pagan thinkers like Aristotle, which is why those horrible Christians you hate so much were responsible for copying and preserving the works of these people for us to enjoy today.

I suggest you read some St. Augustine before making such franky...wrong statements that hold no historical basis and are derived, ironically enough from emotion.

I've burned myself so many times I can't remember and I know for certain that there is no way in hell 88C can give you 3rd degree burns. Just not possible. 88C is relatively cold when it comes to cooking. 

Worst burn I've heard of was when a girl down the road from where  previously worked tripped and pulled the deep fryer and burned all of her lower half. The oil at the time was 180C. I was amazed she was back working in a few months. Real world burns and in a lab burns are different things. I've picked up pans that where 200C+ and not realised it was hot until I realised it was hot then you just gotta put it down without spilling it because you can't drop it, that's food. That hurts a lot and that will burn you good. Still come into work the next day. It will go all red and blister a little, the best way to treat a burn is to run it under cold water for a bit and get back to work, every time it hurts again just give it a little cold water. Warm and hot water hurts a lot though once it's burned and ambient temperature if it's nice and toasty in a kitchen hurts a lot to. Not much you can do about it though. Just whatever you do don't cover it up it won't heal properly. I have experience doing this sort of thing, I've even dunked my arms into water bath water near 90C for seconds at a time. It hurts and your skin is tender afterwards but it's not going to burn properly.

Intolerance towards an ethnic group is basically the definition of bigotry.

For starters, the former is at least debatable, while the latter is demonstrably false, because there are indeed travellers living near my town (and Dublin, the county in which I live, has one of the highest proportions of travellers in Ireland), and yet lo and behold,  I still manage to have a different opinion to you.

&gt;but that's a club shirt, not an NT one

So to get this correctly the national sign of ones origins must not be used if :

-playing for another nationality

-don't belong to said nationality

-playing against orcs in stadium

-You feel like it might offend the other team over history

- All of the above

However it is allowed if:

-used by people of said origin playing for clubs and NT ( last pic was australia btw)

-used by a person of another nationality ( Why is Lichtsteiner guilty?)

-used in a game against a team who'se country you have bad history with

-used against a club with players of a country you were at conflict with


I hope your physical gymnastics are as talented as your mental ones, you will be recruited in a sport no doubt.

&gt; these players aren't ashamed to play for their NT like Shaqiri,Xhaka, they can boast their national symbols for clubs as long as they like, but they dont do it for other national teams,

Like the swiss flag in his boots. I will ask Shaqiri to make the cross next time he scores to not offend eagle-phobic Orcs. Also good to know you are aware of Shaqiri's opinions on switzerland. He can't be swiss and he can't be albanian. Its almost like he is son of a refugee who couldn't return because {someone} burned their documents and they became stateless

1851,"&gt; So you are angry because you are afraid that China could cheat EU? That's so nice of you.

I don't care about that. You keep saying that I'm mad; I'm not. This is something you have said over and over, with no basis in reality. I think the EU is showing serious weakness, and that it vindicates those who dismiss concerns about antagonizing it. This is not complicated. 

The US has done the same thing for years now, and is only now-potentially-changing course. It may not be a great outcome overall, but it will be better than continued acquiescence to an extremely disadvantageous status quo.

&gt;Oh I'm not pretending, I really don't get your point.

That much has become clear; apparently, a person can't say ""That is a bad idea, and it proves someone else right,"" because it does seem like a concept that you are struggling mightily with.

&gt;So you think that US moves its forces because China cheats EU? Weird train of thought but ok.

&gt;Anyway EU is not in NATO, and EU is moving towards more unified military anyway so bringing down NATO would just speed the process.

Setting aside how effective a unified military would ever be, this refers more to non-military matters. Military stuff only matters to small, underpopulated Eastern Europe anyway. This is the domestic argument people are having, and those advocating more of a pivot to Asia and away from Europe writ large are getting a nice boost. 

&gt;Maybe you honestly didn't know this but US declared a trade war against EU and China. And you still think EU should pressure China?

Yes. Why haven't you? Why is this tiny thing from Trump drawing such a massive response, but sustained abuses by China for decades has drawn more nothing? You don't think maybe *both* require responses in kind?

Everyone should be taking China to task, because it is in their interest to do so regardless of what else is going on in the world. Why is this not obvious?

I guess Europeans are just natural followers who are used to thinking small? There is legitimately no other reason why this shouldn't be obvious.

&gt;You don't get it do you? Right now US is acting more like an enemy than China.

1859,"&gt; Actual asylum? Then the numbers would be about similar actually. That's a lot, but to imply they'll all come here all at once is deceitful at best.

You're the one who said economic migrants (aka those in poverty) are on the sliding scale of deserving asylum.  They don't need to all come here at once, even less than 1% of what is projected to be the population of Africa and ME in the next 50 years is enough to crush any refugee system in place that attempts to welcome them.  And even in the best case scenario it's still a drain on Europes economy and destroys social cohesion both within nation states and within the larger European Union (two objectively negative outcomes) which itself could lead to shit like Nazis or Communists as we have seen in the past when economies suck and social cohesion goes out the window, to me that is a greater threat to the larger amount of people and must be considered heavily.

I have never dismissed the moral failings present within past generations, i just do not see the benefit in self flagellation over their existence.  The past is immutable and we owe everything we have to everything they did, for better or worse.  Individuals who are not born on this continent are not deserving of those fruits just as we are not deserving of their ancestors fruits.

1865,"Olah is the Hungarian name for Vlach (medieval name by which foreigners called Romanians). Olasz is a variation of that. Compare that to Wlochy (contemporary Polish name for Italy) and Woloch (Vlach) and Wallachia.

&gt;The word ""Vlach"" is etymologically derived from the ethnonym of a Celtic tribe,[8] adopted into Proto-Germanic *Walhaz which meant ""stranger"", from *Wolkā-[9] (Caesar's Latin: Volcae, Strabo and Ptolemy's Greek: Ouolkai). [10] Via Latin, in Gothic, as *walhs, the ethnonym took on the meaning ""foreigner"" or ""Romance-speaker"",[10] and was adopted into Greek Vláhi (Βλάχοι), Slavic Vlah, Hungarian oláh and olasz, etc.[11][12] The root word was notably adopted in Germanic for Wales and Walloon (German: Welsch),[8] and in Poland Włochy became an exonym for Italians.[10] 

&gt;Via both Germanic and Latin, the term started to signify ""stranger, foreigner"" also in the Balkans, where it in its early form was used for Romance-speakers, but the term eventually took on the meaning of ""shepherd, nomad"".[8] The Romance-speaking communities themselves however used the endonym (they called themselves) ""Romans"".[13] During the early history of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans, there was a social class of Vlachs in Serbia and Macedonia, made up of Christians who served as auxiliary forces and had the same rights as Muslims.[14] In Croatia, the term became derogatory, and Vlasi was used for the ethnic Serb community.[8]

&gt;Romanian scholars have suggested that the term Vlach appeared for the first time in the Eastern Roman Empire and was subsequently spread to the Germanic- and then Slavic-speaking worlds through the Norsemen (possibly by Varangians), who were in trade and military contact with Byzantium during the early Middle Ages (see also Blakumen).[15][16]

&gt;Nowadays, the term ""Vlachs"" (also known under other names, such as Koutsovlachs, Tsintsars, Karagouni, Chobani, Vlasi, etc.[17]) is used in scholarship for the Romance-speaking communities in the Balkans, especially those in Greece, Albania and Macedonia.

Tsarist pogroms killed around 3,000 Jews total. Late XIX century was relatively mild, with ""only"" few hundred victims. Most died during the later 1903-1906 wave. 

Paradoxically, this relatively small scale of violence is why so many at least had a chance to leave (you need to have some money and safe passage). This was actually the intent of Okhrana - to get rid of Jews by intimidation.

The really bloody wave - worst in Europe between 1649 and 1930s - [happened later, in 1918-1919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom#Russian_Civil_War_period) on the territory of modern Ukraine, and resulted in deaths of 30,000-70,000 Jews.  This time, there was little chance to leave safely among the omnipresent chaos. 

The Reds were the *least bad* side to the Jews at that time, thanks to proclaimed and partially believed adherence to universal equality. This is what /u/Qumielhan probably refers to.

&gt; In a comparison of register-based studies in Finland, Sweden and

&gt; crimes among different immigrant groups. The same applies to observed
&gt; differences between immigrants (as a single aggregated category) and the
&gt; native population.
&gt; Register-based multivariate analyses were conducted to ascertain
&gt; whether or not the crime-immigration link is spurious, as immigration
&gt; status can be a proxy for social disadvantage. **Adjustments for age, gender,
&gt; and income decreased the immigrants’ higher risks of crime and
&gt; victimization, compared to natives. However, the risk difference remained
&gt; significant**. The difference between immigrants and natives was in part
&gt; explained by the high proportion of young men and low-median income
&gt; level of immigrants. **These factors explained even less differences between
&gt; the immigrant groups**. In the survey-based analyses, routine activities,

&gt; Could you supply any source on Italy managing?

That boat the recently prevented from landing.

&gt; Are you hereby arguing that a person under threat of prosecution or violence for, say, their sexual orientation, should speak a European language before they are eligible for asylum?

I'm not saying they should or shouldn't. I do think the political trend is towards getting more strict on asylum claims, and European governments are going to have to follow what their voters want.

In general it's easier for someone to do well in a country if they speak that country's language. If Sweden insisted that people spoke Swedish before granting asylum -- maybe they could give people some time to do so -- I would be happy with that. E.g. learn Swedish within 6 months -- here's learning materials and a course -- or you're out. This would have the added advantage in selecting out low intelligence people.

&gt; Do you think we should close our societies to people who suffer for instance from Islamic repression?

I think that Islam is a problem in the West, and that's partly because many Muslims living here simultaneously believe (1) the West is better for them to live in than Islamic countries, because they have moved there from here, (2) Islamic values are better than Western values because the West is decadent. These two beliefs are incompatible.

Don't like Western values? Fine. But then don't live here.

I think that non-Muslim minorities living in Muslim countries are unlikely to become Muslim terrorists.  However it doesn't follow that they agree with Western values.

The issue is that in a natural environment, without the nationalistic categories, it seems fairly natural for different ethnic/linguistic/racial groups to mix on the borders. But when you create artificial categories like countries that are meant to label ethnicitys due to lines on the map then you end up with the mess that is large amounts of Europe.

In Russias case I feel that the overturning of the democratic govt. of Ukraine (regardless of how evil/corrupt/justified some ppl feel it was) with a distinctly anti-Russian pro-Western possibly NATO-inclined Ukrainian govt. forced Russia into some inevitable actions vis-a-vis Crimea. Could they afford Ukraine terminating their arrangement there, would, in time, a NATO-joining Ukraine lead to NATO naval forces being based there?

2026,"&gt; If things had gotten better since then, you'd think the people who favour multiculturalism and mass immigration would publish updated information as a powerful argument to prove the ""bigots"" wrong. The fact that they haven't done this suggests that it's either stayed the same, or gotten worse.

Below are the facts.

&gt; According to official statistics, the reported crime rate in Sweden has risen since 2005 whereas annual government surveys show that the number of Swedes experiencing crime remain steady since 2005, even as Sweden has taken in hundreds of thousands of immigrants and refugees over the same period.

This is later explained by

&gt; Speaking in February 2017, Manne Gerell, a doctoral student in criminology at Malmo University, noted that while immigrants where disproportionately represented among crime suspects, many of the victims of immigrant crimes were other immigrants.

Also

&gt; According to data gathered by Swedish police from October 2015 to January 2016, 5,000 police calls out of 537,466 involved asylum seekers and refugees. According to Felipe Estrada, professor of criminology at Stockholm University, this shows how the media gives disproportionate attention to and exaggerates the alleged criminal involvement of asylum seekers and refugees.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_crime

&gt; Simple math will thus tell you that 16% of the population commited 40% of the crimes. This is a huge overrepresentation.

**Does your study cover repeat offenders?**

In Germany, for example

&gt; The figures showed that most of the suspected crimes were by repeat offenders, and that 1 percent of migrants accounted for 40 percent of total migrant crimes.

Sweden has similar statistics for [recidivism](https://www.bra.se/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/crime-statistics/recidivism.html).

&gt; Forty percent of all persons with an initial event in 2011 relapsed into crime within three years.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/8tz1lj/swedens_farright_eyes_election_gains_as_gang/e1bf6yc/,adevland,1530018812
2027,"&gt; you simply can't deny that the last two big western unilateral interventions in MENA ended in a disaster

The root of the problem is not ""laterality"" of intervention, but lack of consistency. The operations were half-assed, and removal of dictators left power vacuum. 

&gt; Perhaps we should draw some conclusion from that and not jump in another intervention initiative.

Isolationism only means that we're going to solve problems knocking on our doors, not earlier. And the problem knocking on our door is usually a problem which can't be solved anymore, but only mitigated.

Si que hay algun que otro problema con barriadas conflictivas del estilo de las 3000 viviendas o San Lazaro en Plasencia, pero son problemas tipicos de la pobreza y exclusion social, tanto de los payos como de los gitanos de esos barrios.

Expulsar a los gitanos? Inmigracion gitana? De que hablas, aqui han habido gitanos desde que España es Cristiana (lee bien la frase que ya te veo venir), a quien quieres echar, a los gitanos Europeos? Los quieres mandar de vuelta a Europa central? Manera cojonuda de arreglar un problema de exclusion social y pobreza.

&gt; Sex offences are a type of offence where repeated exposure is relatively common. 42% of the persons who were exposed to sex offences were exposed between two and nine times in 2016. Roughly one-tenth (or 12%) were exposed ten times or more.

&gt; It is important to note that sex offences comprise a broad spectrum of offences – everything from minor incidents, such as indecent exposure, to very serious incidents, such as rape.

The fact is that dual-citizenship systems create ever-present loyalty conflicts, where the host nations have no way of telling where true loyalties lie before it is too late.

Why do you think Africans accept taking highly perilous journeys to Europe, only to live here illegally? Because it's worth it for them. The circumstances back home are so miserable, that it's worth risking their lives for the hope of better lives. It's simple game theory. They aren't being irrational or dumb, they're being rational in that they realize the potential rewards outweigh the risks.

It would NOT be worth it they could actually have semi-decent lives back home. Nobody is gonna go risk their lives and finances(or very few) if they can live decently at home.

That Africans are genetically inferior to Europeans and cannot possibly achieve Eastern European standards of living?

After WWII nationalism in general was somewhat discredited in Germany and the Bundeswehr was a purely defensive force against a possible invasion.
That only started to change in the 1990s. But the to use the military to further national interests wasn't really an acceptable idea anymore for a major part of the population.

So the Bundeswehr is mostly seen as more of a tool to get some bonus points from allies (Afghanistan) and not so much as a force, that acts in the interest of the individual citizen.
It doesn't defend our freedom, but acts for the benefit of others basically.

Maybe the political way out of this is is indeed to not use the military for ""German interests"" but for ""European interests"". Could be more palatable for the public.

2361,"I don't think we joke that much about Slovaks; when I was growing up at least, jokes usually targeted the Russians, Germans, Americans and Czechs themselves.

E.g.:

An American, a Russian and a Czech get arrested in a crackpot Third World country and sentenced to death as spies. They put them in a death row; the first to be executed is the American. The executioners tell him:

*""In our country, we have a custom that the condemned can choose the manner of his execution.""*

The American thinks for a second and replies:

*""Well, the electric chair is a great American invention, so I pick that.""*

So they find and electric chair, strap him in, put the wet sponge on his head, get ready, throw the switch and... nothing. There's a power outage. They tell the American:

*""In our country, we also have a custom that should the first attempt to execute the prisoner be unsuccessful, the condemned is pardoned and released.""*

The American is obviously very happy to hear that. When he walks out of the prison through the death row, he whispers to the Czech guy: 

*""The power's out!""*

The executioner then comes for the Czech guy and asks him what manner of execution he's chosen. The Czech guy smartly replies: 

*""I'd also like the electric chair.""*

And so they strap him in the electric chair, put the wet sponge on his head, get ready, throw the switch and... still nothing. The power outage continues. They curse and inform him that due to their national custom, he will now be pardoned and released. The Czech is happy and when he walks through the death row, he whispers to the Russian:

*""The power is still out!""*

The executioner then comes for the Russian and asks him to pick the manner of his execution.

The Russian looks up and says:

*""Well, if the power is still out, you can just shoot me instead.""*

2442,"Has anyone else besides me read the letter of intent? News articles did not seem to link it. Maybe I am seriously misjudging what I read, but I cannot see how the EI2 is in any way an intervention force. At best, it will be a way to form a common strategic culture and doctrine. No doubt this is necessary for military integration and highly complementary to PESCO, which doesn't have a similar project focusing on C3.

However, I do not see how this is in any way an intervention force. There is no command structure. There is no personnel or equipment earmarked. In fact, the letter explicitly states nothing of the sort will occur. For an intervention force, I would still rather look at the CRC (even though I do not know the details there, it too might be something entirely different).

Edit: I should try and point out EI2's usefulness. I believe it could be the great-grandfather of a European military command, definitely of its planning staff. Right now, it has zero executive powers. However, its purpose will be to create ""a forum"" (whatever that is) to 

a) figure out explicit areas/tasks for countries to co-operate in/on,

b) formulate explicit mission objectives for these, 

c) create a taxonomy of all the forces of all member states to fulfil said objectives,

d) and agree on a coherent, common strategy using these foces to fulfil said objectives.

While none of the above will be legally binding, I do believe countries' national interests will pressure them into co-operating regardless. This is why only chosen countries were invited. As you can see, the tasks themselves are not so different from what an actual military planning staff would engage in.

Where EI2 differs is of course that there is no legal mechanism to force compliance, even no unified army to command/plan for. However, seen from an operational perspective EI2 will fulfill one vital part of what a military command does, namely the planning stage. By EI2's very definition, this will create a common strategic doctrine of the countries involved.

At some point, when necessity enforces reform, there is a chance this will butterfly into an actual command since the planning competences are already present in the ""forum"" that is to be created. You want to have short lines of communications between those with the info (those who plan) and those who need to act on it (from a high level point of view), so putting them all together in one institution will be natural once they communicate on a regular basis.

2450,"&gt;My point is, that Russian riot scenario with little unmarked green men is impossible in Estonia. Estonia is fully capable of deterring ""little green men"" on it's own and if Russia goes full retard and launches an open invasion, then that's why we have NATO.

You present legitimate points, that would make an incursion unlikely, but certainly not impossible.   


\&gt; Our border police regularly catches cigarette smugglers, what makes you think they would not detect someone smuggling ""small arms, equipment and special forces across the border""?

a) not every cigarette smuggler is caught, b) they can fund local cells and obtain resources locally, c) there are always holes, either in the border, or some other EU members border, there are hundreds of thousands of Russian tourists in Estonia and Russian diplomatic envoy acts as an intelligence arm. d) what if they just suddenly come over the border? There isn't much of a constant military presence in Narva itself.

\&gt; Besides that, the war in Ukraine happened when Ukraine was in the middle of revolution and basically nobody was in charge of the state/military, which is very different from Estonia.

  
Completely agree. This is why a national cohesion and multipartisan political culture is very important for us. Are you sure that were we to have another economic crisis, with an EU wide crisis (like immigration + EU-sceptisism), that Estonia couldn't fall into a domestic tangle? EKRE gets in power and starts anti-Russian policies (just a hypothetical). Maybe it gets Estonian Russians organised.

\&gt; Moreover, what would cause the ""Russian riot""? And even if it happened there would be preceding events that would give time to mobilise Estonian Defence Forces near Narva. Narva is just in 150km from the military base in Tapa.  


What if Russian supported cells simply start a riot? There's plenty of non-loyal Russian element in Estonia (more than a hundred thousands Russian citizens and non-citizens). And military mobilisation will take, at best, a day if not more. What if they do it in the middle of the night in the summer. Professional soldiers/officiers are at home sleeping, while there is a hole in the number of conscripts (between June and July)? 150 km is still a few hours drive away, they could still potentially seize and fortify positions in Narva by that time. Meaning we have to go on an offensive to regain ground.

\&gt; The closest thing we had to the ""Russian riot"" is the Bronze Night and even then Russia did not risk attacking Estonia (however it attacked Georgia a year later, which is neither a NATO/EU member and was a lot more unstable than Estonia at that moment).  


2007 Russia and 2018 Russia are somewhat different beasts. They have considerably modernised their army and Russia is already much more on the fringes of diplomatic world than it was back then. And are you 100&amp;#37; sure there was no danger of invasion back then?

2530,"SUWALKI, Poland — U.S. commanders are worried that if they had to head off a conflict with Russia, the most powerful military in the world could get stuck in a traffic jam.

Humvees could snarl behind plodding semis on narrow roads as they made their way east across Europe. U.S. tanks could crush rusting bridges too weak to hold their weight. Troops could be held up by officious passport-checkers and stubborn railway companies.

Although many barriers would drop away if there were a declaration of war, the hazy period before a military engagement would present a major problem. NATO has just a skeleton force deployed to its member countries that share a border with Russia. Backup forces would need to traverse hundreds of miles. And the delays — a mixture of bureaucracy, bad planning and decaying infrastructure — could enable Russia to seize NATO territory in the Baltics while U.S. Army planners were still filling out the 17 forms needed to cross Germany and into Poland.

During at least one White House exercise that gamed out a European war with Russia, the logistical stumbles contributed to a NATO loss.

That possibility is tangible for troops who have gotten stuck trying to move between training exercises in Europe — like the U.S. Army squadron that budgeted two weeks last year to get their Stryker armored vehicles back by train to Germany from the Black Sea nation of Georgia. It took four months, leaving the troops sitting in Germany without their rides or weaponry, said Lt. Col. Adam Lackey, the commander of the squadron.

“We have to be able to move as fast or faster than Russia in order to be an effective deterrent,” said Ben Hodges, the U.S. Army’s former top general in Europe.

Since retiring in December, Hodges has devoted himself to raising the alarm from his perch at the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis, and he successfully pushed to get troop-mobility issues on the agenda of a NATO summit in Brussels next month. The United States and NATO, Hodges said, need to be able to “mass enough capability in place so that Russia doesn’t make a terrible miscalculation.”

The original rationale for the NATO alliance was to defend against a potential war with Russia. Western troops regularly practiced for large-scale conflict — and the front line between East and West Germany was just miles away from where more than 200,000 U.S. troops were deployed.

But when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Western planners cheerfully threw away the playbooks in the hope of new cooperation with Moscow. For years after NATO’s 2004 expansion into territory that had once been the Soviet Union’s, the alliance had no plans for how to defend its new members. 

“We didn’t think about enlargement in those military terms,” said Douglas Lute, a retired three-star U.S. Army general and former U.S. ambassador to NATO, who as a young officer patrolled the internal German border a short trip away from where he was stationed.

Russia’s 2014 seizure of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula provided a jolt. Western planners went to retrieve their Cold War-era playbooks from the dustbin. But their Russia-fighting muscles had atrophied to the point where they could barely flex, and their ability to move across Europe had decayed.

“Transportation is a problem in a very practical way. But it’s a symptom of a bigger problem,” Lute said. “We’re now confronting the image that we had for the last 25 years, of Europe whole, free and at peace. It’s not whole, it’s not free, and it’s not at peace.”

In some cases, military planners in Moscow had a better picture of bridges, roads and the weak points of the new NATO territories — because they used to be the Soviet Union’s.

And whereas Russia has no challenge moving its troops inside its own territory, a thicket of peacetime rules has complicated military movements within Europe. 

Germany, for instance, allows trucks loaded with tanks and other heavy equipment on highways only at night on weekdays. Sweden, which isn’t a member of NATO but works closely with the alliance, requires three weeks’ notice before most military personnel and equipment can enter. The rails on Baltic railroads are set apart wider than the Western standard, meaning that trains have to be laboriously unloaded, then reloaded near Poland’s border with Lithuania. That can add days to a major movement of troops.

“If you can get there in 45 days, you’re just late to the fight,” said Maj. Gen. Steven Shapiro, the two-star officer charged with organizing the U.S. Army’s movements in Europe. Shapiro noted he recently had to file 17 forms to get troops from the German port of Bremerhaven to their destination in Poland. “There are days where we move at the speed of war. But, generally speaking, that’s outside of the current norm.”

For example, there was the ordeal of the U.S. Army squadron that needed to bring its equipment back from Georgia to Germany last year.

“On the 15th of August, we finished our mission,” said Lackey, the squadron’s commander. “Some vehicles didn’t return until late December.”

Obstacles quickly piled up. Hungarian border guards didn’t like the Romanian-approved way the Stryker armored vehicles were chained to rail cars, so the chains on all 12 trainloads had to come off and be refastened, Lackey said. One inspector flunked the convoy on Thursday, took the weekend off and came back days later. The Strykers missed their narrow window in Germany’s teeming rail network and had to wait in line behind commuter and commercial train traffic.

“They don’t care if you’re U.S. Army Europe,” Lackey said. “They’re Deutsche Bahn.”

The squadron ended up having to train back in Germany without their specialized vehicles — a bit like forcing Formula One drivers to run sprints because their racecars are stuck on a trailer. Once the Strykers finally arrived, the troops discovered that the lashing rains and snow of a European autumn doubled the amount of maintenance needed to get them back into fighting shape, Lackey said.

If a crisis had broken out while the soldiers waited, they wouldn’t have been ready to roll out.

Lackey’s squadron is now leading a NATO deployment in northeastern Poland. This time around, he said, “we will drive everywhere.”

NATO leaders are just beginning to address the underlying issues. They have worked with the European Union in the past year to boost funding for infrastructure and reduce bureaucratic roadblocks. At the Brussels summit next month — barring surprises from President Trump, who has frequently complained that other NATO nations are not spending enough on defense — they are expected to approve two new military commands that would speed transit from the East Coast of the United States all the way to NATO’s border with Russia. That would boost the number of people working full-time to solve the problems, which even still will take years to eliminate.

2531,"
In a related move, leaders are also expected to approve plans to increase the number of NATO troops that could make the rapid journey if needed, to about 30,000 within 30 days. NATO currently has a rapid-reaction force of 5,000 troops on standby to deploy within 10 days, and military planners fear that is not enough.

Taken together, these changes would mark a significant boost in NATO’s efforts to try to deter Russia, although they would not come close to the military resources that were ready for a short-notice fight at Cold War heights.

The hope is that they can avoid war by being able to rush troops to scare off the enemy across the border. “As long as we can provide credible and strong deterrence, including the ability to move forces, then we are preventing conflict,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said this month.

The trickiest spot to defend in all of NATO is likely the narrow strip of land that connects Lithuania to Poland. The 40-mile-wide corridor is hemmed in by the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on one side and Belarus, a Russian ally, on the other. It is the Baltic nations’ lifeline to the rest of NATO — and the connection is through a single rail line on the wrong gauge and one usable two-lane highway over rolling terrain that switches from lakes to forests to farmland.

Worried Western officials have started calling the area the Suwalki gap, taking inspiration from the Fulda Gap that was the weakest point in Cold War-era defenses of West Germany.

The Suwalki area is well within range of sophisticated Russian antiaircraft missiles stationed in Kaliningrad, so in combat simulations, NATO commanders have hesitated to send warplanes near the region. That led to the Baltics quickly being seized. Any troops coming in on the ground would have to fight without air support — and their entry into the region could be halted by something as simple as a single overturned truck on the highway.

“The place that is most vulnerable to this kind of a rapid strike is the Suwalki corridor region,” said Hodges, the former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe, who has been working on a report about how to bolster the area’s defenses.

Now, camouflaged troop carriers ply the region’s roads, some of which are so narrow they don’t have lane markings to divide each direction of traffic. Long columns of cars can pile up behind slow-moving trucks on the main route into Lithuania; the only alternative is a country road that can’t handle heavy traffic. Lumbering Belarus-built tractors can sometimes make the traffic move even more slowly.

The vulnerability means that if Russian troops were massing across the border, NATO would need to deploy — fast. A 2016 study from the Rand Corp. found that Russia could seize the Latvian capital of Riga in 60 hours or less. 

“We cannot change the geography,” said Lt. Col. Mindaugas Petkevicius, the deputy commander of a NATO logistics team based in Lithuania. “It’s a natural choke point.”

Inside Lithuania’s military headquarters, the need for speed is on stark display. Packed rucksacks stand on top of the closets in every office so that workers can mobilize immediately if war breaks out. Computer keyboards have Cyrillic-alphabet overlays, the better to communicate with Russian and Belarusan counterparts.

“The Baltics could be the place where Russia tests all of NATO,” said the officer who runs logistics for the Lithuanian Defense Ministry, Lt. Col. Valdas Dambrauskas. “If it fails, all of NATO fails.”",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/8twq9o/if_they_needed_to_fend_off_war_with_russia_us/e1au2ac/,DetlefKroeze,1529983644

How is this a counterpoint to what I said?

Oh the irony in complaining about this while you're telling another country how to handle its military

&gt; Just like the Euro is not an E.U. thing, but is the defacto currency of the union 

No, it is the currency of the union de jure. The euro is enshrined in the EU treaties as is Schengen, I'll concede this is a EU thing when participation will be forced upon accession to the EU

&gt; Wait, didn't you just said that it was not an EU thing? 

It's not an EU initiative, it wasn't proposed by the commission, it doesn't answer to the council, it has no oversight from the parliament

Nevertheless once this project has matured I have no doubt it'll extend to the rest of the union, but hopefully only once it has reached maturity.

And regardless of future expansion more cooperation between EU members outside of the EU paves the way towards reform of the EU itself and military cooperation of this kind is the right direction, even if it's not an EU thing yet.

The government was essentially backing terrible loans in an effort to incentivize banks to make high risk loans to people without means and thus increase housing ownership. If they had just been hands off, the banks would have never gave out the loans.

It's the same reason why the US is suffering under massive student debt. All student debt loans are backed by the government in that you cannot declare bankruptcy on them. This is an effort by the government to control the education market and get everyone a college education.

2827,"""HATE SPEECH AND xenophobic populism"" is basically people that don't want immigrants . Isn't this what they are implying. 
 1. Hate speech, what exactly is hate speech nowadays ? if I say that I don't like most of the romas or islam would be hate speech for a lot of people.Anyone that offends someone or is against their point of view is hate speech nowadays .
 2.xenophobia  was always there..it was just directed to different people : the jews, the romani ,eastern europeans,now immigrants. Just a change of targets. 
 3. Islamophobia ? a phobia would mean an irrational fear .. The current Islam is not compatible at all with the western world.
It's nice of them that they bring the LGBT problems that we face in some EU countries but they are ok with bringing people here that imprison or murder the same LGBT people in their own countries . Pretty ironic.
Also they bring up Antisemitic ..witch again,a lot of the same immigrants despise jews. 
Like always media outlets like to blow everything out of proportions and call names

Direct work so that patents produced are essential to a process even if they weren't the best route to do something.  It wasn't in producing the next amazing thing.  Was kinda disillusioning, turned me away from research.

It's hard to evaluate just how *well* a researcher is researching.  It's not like a bricklayer — if you're doing something worthwhile, there's risk and unknowns to it, and it's hard to say whether you just got unlucky on a risky venture or did a bad job.  And they're uncomfortably far away from where the money is being made.

Number of patents are gameable and was never designed to be an evaluation criteria, but gets used as such.  It's not hard to get lame patents through.  Number of papers cited?  Researchers aren't stupid — they swap citations.

I dunno.  I think that we've still got a ways to go here.  Because if you can better-incentivize researchers, you get better research, and that's a valuable thing.

3079,"I thought that this was gonna be [Marston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Moulton_Marston).  Invented the lie detector, Wonder Woman, and had some interesting views on gender roles and goals for changing society.

&gt;William Moulton Marston's philosophy of diametric opposites has bled into his design of his Wonder Woman mythology. This theme of diametrics took the form of his emphasis on certain masculine and feminine configurations as well as dominance and submission.[citation needed]
&gt;
&gt;Marston's ""Wonder Woman"" is an early example of bondage themes that were entering popular culture in the 1930s.[1] Physical and mental submission appears again and again throughout Marston's comics work, with Wonder Woman and her criminal opponents frequently being tied up (or otherwise restrained), and her Amazonian sisters engaging in frequent wrestling and bondage play. These elements were softened by later writers of the series, who dropped such characters as the Nazi-like blond female slaver Eviless completely, despite her having formed the original Villainy Inc. of Wonder Woman's enemies (in Wonder Woman #28, the last by Marston.)[citation needed]
&gt;
&gt;Though Marston had described female nature as being more capable of submission emotion, in his other writings and interviews,[citation needed] he referred to submission as a noble practice and did not shy away from the sexual implications, saying:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The only hope for peace is to teach people who are full of pep and unbound force to enjoy being bound... Only when the control of self by others is more pleasant than the unbound assertion of self in human relationships can we hope for a stable, peaceful human society... Giving to others, being controlled by them, submitting to other people cannot possibly be enjoyable without a strong erotic element.[19]
&gt;
&gt;One of the purposes of these bondage depictions was to induce eroticism in readers as a part of what he called ""sex love training."" Through his Wonder Woman comics, he aimed to condition readers to becoming more readily accepting of loving submission to loving authorities rather than being so assertive with their own destructive egos. About male readers, he later wrote: ""Give them an alluring woman stronger than themselves to submit to, and they'll be proud to become her willing slaves!""[20]

3107,"&gt; Please tell me, why would Western Europe with its low birth rates need something similar to the one child policy?

I'm not advocating for a general one child policy, I'm advocating for a policy like that for welfare leeches, people that are unable to even care for themselves and have to rely on hand-outs from others. They should not be encouraged to breed, in fact they should be prevented from doing that.

Nobody has a problem with normal, productive citizens having several children, to the contrary, that's exactly what Europe needs. And if these people wouldn't be forced to support the welfare recipients financially, they would have more money to spend for their own offspring and families and - possibly - have more children themselves as a result.

&gt;Also, who is to decide if people have enough children, should not have more children, and so on?

Well, obviously the state apparatus, just like it works in any other instance in which we force people to follow laws and established guidelines.

&gt;You also seem to think that poverty is just or mainly a question of the ""wrong people"" breeding and so on, and that it can be solved if just ""intelligent"" people would get children. In fact it is much more influenced by the general market situation and political decisions.

Yes, my point is that this can be changed into a proper direction if there's enough people that want that and are willing to push for political change to make it happen.

That's what happened when the Nazis got into power, except they of course went way overboard with the eugenics and took a wrong turn somewhere and ended up with concentration camps and the extermination of undesirables.

But that's not the only way to practice eugenics and discourage dysgenics - there are plenty possible human alternatives to eugenics programs of the early 20th century. ",,/r/europe/comments/8tp9dj/the_centreleft_will_never_defeat_european/e19jo8p/,MaximumCoconut,1529939466

Are you sure you got that right? This is what the article says:

&gt;the study found that between 1995 and 2011, immigrants from non-EEA countries claimed more in benefits than they paid in taxes

It seems to me that you're mixing ALL immigration together with non-EU migration.

I was referring to the latter solely. And particularly immigration from the MENA region, Africa and parts of Asia (the Muslim countries).

I'm well aware the inner-European migration is - at least economically - beneficial. Even some non-EU migration is, nobody complains about Canadian, Japanese or Singoperan migration.

It is actually YOU who seems to get off on knowing history of those terms and tries to lecture everybody about this little nugget of (perceived) wisdom, without realising that you are flat out wrong because your info is outdated. 


This here gives some pointers:

&gt;The exact origin of the terminology “third world” is unclear. In 1952, a French demographer named Alfred Sauvy wrote an article in a French magazine, L’Observateur, that ended by comparing the Third World with the Third Estate of pre-revolutionary France. Sauvy may have been the first to use the phrase, remarking “this ignored Third World, exploited, scorned like the Third Estate.”
&gt;
&gt;The modern descriptor has moved away from its original definition. Today, various indicators, which are have nothing to do with Cold War alliances, are used to classify “Third World” countries. These include political rights and civil liberties, Gross National Income (GNI), Human Development (HDI), as well as the freedom of information within a country. The concept of the “third world” has evolved to describe countries that suffer from high infant mortality, low economic development, high levels of poverty and little to no ability to utilize natural resources.

An alternative is that the working class is not socially left .  The working class are socially right but economically left.

*While such crime went down by 21.9 percent between 2007 and 2014, it was up again by 10.4 percent by the end of 2016. Some 83 percent of the cases were solved -- and 92.1 percent of the increase was attributable to the newcomers.*",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8tiw3z/merkel_loses_support_far_right_rises_after/e19ct76/,YoungDan23,1529932429

3230,"For all intents and purposes, Turkey is basically in Europe. Comparing them as a powerhouse to the middle east, is a little naive.. The entire middle east is destabilised. Might as well compare them to Europe.

You also forget, the advantage they had, in a vast Ottoman Empire. 1844-1922... Rather recent.

I do not see how an islamic Fundamentalist.. In Erdogan.. 2003-2018...
Has done turkey any favours at all.

The founder of Turkey... 
Mustafa Kemal Atatürk 1923-1938 had already formed a power house in Turkey.

Himself and the presidents that followed, had done one thing, differentiating them from the rest of the middle east.. They had 'some form' of western principles, and were against the enslavement of fundamentalist religion... 

Liberals want to say Islam is all nice and a religion of peace.. But it = SHARIA LAW, in its pure form. Which is backwards.. Women have no rights.. They have to hide in public.. They are not allowed to read past age 12... Stonnings.. The religion, when it takes control.. Is NOT progressive. The fundamental message of islam, is to spread the faith far and wide, by force, as expressed by mohammed. People may not like this notion in our hyper liberal accepting mindset. But its the truth.

Turkey had managed to break free, from the constant strife of fundamentalists, trying to take control. They had seperated Religion and state, and Turks were some of the 'least fundamentalist' muslims, following the faith 'strictly' in the entire middle east.

Erdogan, is as much a fundamentalist, as Turkey has ever had since ala-turk.. In fact he was once jailed for inciting violence and holy war with a poem. He was banned from running for office.

Erdogan, has done absolutely nothing, to ease tensions with neighbors. Turkey's economy is failing. Their is hyperinflation...

[Erdogan wins more power, and it might not help Turkey's economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/25/turkey-elections-2018-erdogan-has-won-but-faces-economy-woes.html)

Sorry you are talking rubbish, if you think Erdogan has done anything for the Turkish economy. All Erdogan represents is hyper nationalism. Islamisation of Turkey, fundamentalism, and unification of state and religion.

Watch the video.. Farmer about to light himself on fire, because he can no longer make a living.. Farmers are the same across turkey cant speak out, because they are scared. Overpriced vergetables.. People can barely afford food at this point..

Please explain to me how Erdogan has done anything positive.. Turkey is a power house. But no.. It was never in the dire situation China was.. And no, there is no comparison to what Xi Jinping has managed to achieve for China.

And that's why those fellas can ponder in broad daylight whether the best course of action for the West, after wreaking havoc in whole regions of the world and tearing them asunder, is just to sink civil ships in the Mediterranean or build a fence around countries to leave the people out to starve peacefully on their own.

The poor in the “flyover” states care about good jobs and putting food on the table.  They don’t care about poor people in other counties who come here and are willing to work for a third of their wage.  Rich Democrats on the coasts get flippant and say things like “if an (illegal) immigrant can take your job, then you should have gotten a better education”, or some other bullshit like that.  Great thing to say to a 50 year old factory worker who *had* a comfortable job when he got it 30 years ago.  So he should go back to school (and accumulate a mountain of non-dischargable debt) and do what?  “Just be a software developer”?  Motherfucker, not everyone *can* do that job, or else it would pay as shitty as a janitor.  Also, ageism is rampant in the job market.

3266,"&gt; People keep using the word ""dehumanise"" 

Probably because some people do it often (especially in online - it's easier on the internet).


&gt;

(a) open borders to tens of millions, perhaps hundreds of millions of people who cannot realistically be housed, integrated or taken care of by Europe (this option will certainly lead to the collapse of the EU, many of its nation states and very it will also lead to an electoral coup by nationalist/far-right populist parties promising to stem the flow by much more brutal means); or

(b) protect the continent by stopping people from reaching it, without directly killing them.
I say that, realistically, the (B) option is the only one viable in such a messed up situation. The primary job of an elected politician is to protect the interests of those who elected him or her.

Surely there is no space for everyone, and each European country has there own problems to solve. But each scenario requires a particular approach. We can't get in the complete Africa, that's for sure. But we can prioritize help to refugees, which would require proper screening from economic migrants - I can't blame economic migrants for looking for a better future (everyone does it, anyway) but the priority would be real refugees. And with that, we should give direct support in solving some of their issues in Africa (without throwing down governments at our will). And in very extreme scenarios we would have to find other solutions. 

Turkey and Lebanon have real refugees crisis. The EU did not. Yet, we see the way so many of the latter treat refugees.

3273,"For those who stayed with the title but didn't read the article or have previous knowledge about the situation:

Barcelona, as well as some other places in Spain, is currently having huge problems with tourism. For a series of reasons, Spain tends to attract a lot of ""party-tourism"", which isn't usually the most respectful with the city or its locals. Aside from this, unrestricted tourism has had a terrible effect on the cost of living, raising it to absurd levels relative to typical local salaries, especially regarding housing.

On the other hand, we have the fact that Spain is quite used to constant waves of immigration from MENA, and for another series of reasons, also has a sociopolitical landscape that hasn't favoured the rise of xenophobia against those minorities (which doesn't mean it's non-existent, it's simply not as common as elsewhere). Although of course the influx of poor people has probably had an effect on crime rates, it's also true that a good share of immigrants from previous generations have been able to integrate well (learn the language/s and find honest jobs).

So, despite what the wording of the title might make you think, the fact that some kinds of tourists are seen in a worse light than poor immigrants is not because of some kind of ""progressive blindness"" or ""silliness"". Preexistent socially progressive ideologies might have had something to do with it, but as usual, the main cause is much simpler: the effect of tourism (in its current shape) on the local population is perceived as being significantly worse than that of immigration.",,/r/europe/comments/8tprqr/tourists_go_home_refugees_welcome_why_barcelona/e19d5gb/,NumberNinethousand,1529932840

So there is something European countries can do here: Don't let them have double citizenship. Force them to decide between your or Turkish citizenship.

And you also ignored the operating costs which means you don't get a profit of 9.25 cents per KWh and of course the decommissioning costs need to be added. To call that moving the goalposts is frankly dishonest on your part as that IS money that needs to be earned before you can say that you have recouped your investment.

&gt;Thats very unlikely to happen, non of the current renewable expansion and battery cost curves support that. We don't expect any form of commercial battery generation worth mentioning on our grid before 2045 for example.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-energy-renewables/renewables-could-be-80-percent-of-energy-by-2050-u-n-idUSTRE7481L220110509

It doesn't get more official than a UN report doesn't it? Also the price curves for lithium ion batteries absolutely support that. From 2014 to 2017 the prices of battery storage tech for home use has fallen by 60% in Germany. Between 2017 and 2030 another 60% decline in price is expected.

Right now it's already economically profitable if i switch from a petrol car and energy from the grid to an electric car, batteries in my house and a solar installation. The costs per year in my case are 4500€ compared to 3850€ and the only reason why i don't switch is because keeping my current car running is the most economic solution.

Now obviously that is only small scale and i have the huge advantage that i don't need to worry about a blackout as i can still receive energy from the grid if required. But renewable power is closer than people might think.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/8th10f/germany_neglects_renewables_set_to_miss_2020/e1987p2/,Alcobob,1529925691

I tend to agree with all your points bar the first one. Their approach to immigration is a consequence of the fact that socialists and communists were internationalists (workers of all the world unite, remember?). It was the conservatives and the nazis who entrenched within the national borders (before the conservatives turned to Reagan and Thatcher for inspiration). 

The problem of the left is that they don't have an economic alternative to either their old ways or the neoliberal formula. As much as Corbyn and co. dislike it, the world in 2020 will not be like the world in 1960s. There are no more immense factories employing thousands and thousands of workers, because Western countries have transitioned to a service based economy (even Germany and Italy, while still retaining much of their manufacturing, have done so). So they should also talk to the white collars, the new professions like IT professions,and the temps . You can't just talk to the welders.

My understanding of the comments I replied to are that if someone moves country by virtue of them being a foreigner they will never truly belong to the country they move to and while ever they hold cultural customs or recognise their heritage they are outsiders. They believe everyone who moves country should forego their heritage and assimilate.

I think that's fucked up, unreasonable, impossible and entirely neglects that what it is to be a citizen of country X is and always has been in flux due to the exchange of cultural ideas brought about by the very immigration and movement of people and ideas that they are insisting people stifle. If 16th century Britain was a country today a modern Briton would feel like and be treated like an outsider looking purely at cultural values and ignoring technology. 

Countries change due to the flow of people and throwing around labels of people not belonging in a country because they don't uphold the cultural customs of country X is just a crutch for their racism. If you take issue with Turkish stances on women's rights say so. If you take issue with their stances on religion say so.

3508,"That's what the offshore centres are for.

But generally speaking, refugees don't have a right to *pick* the country where they'll receive asylum. Realistically, if they're in clear and present danger in their home country, they should flee to the nearest safe country, not embark on a very expensive and dangerous journey across half the world to claim asylum in, surprise surprise, the most developed part of the world.

I am 100% in favour of EU providing generous humanitarian assistance to countries bearing refugee burdens. For example, if Syrians flee en masse from Syria due to the civil war there, the EU should help them in countries neighbouring Syria, i.e. Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey etc. At the same time, the EU should tell them: 

*""make no mistake, we will help you, but if you try to illegally cross the EU border, you will lose any chance of ever going to Europe again and we will deport you to an offshore processing centre where you'll stay indefinitely until we're able to return you to your country of origin or a country willing to take you in. You'll be much better served by NOT ATTEMPTING to illegally get into Europe. In that case, you will receive assistance from us.""*

tl;dr: these people must be told that they 'can't make Europe home', to steal a phrase from the Australians. Europe should help, but not by becoming a hostel for refugees from the entire frigging planet. Europe is not responsible for everything bad that happens in the Middle East, Africa, Central Asia and elsewhere. It should primarily take care of its own affairs (i.e. deal with conflicts and refugee flows originating in Europe) and help other parts of the world by giving assistance to people there.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/8tidpk/economic_migrants_should_apply_through_regular/e191d89/,Victor_D,1529910738

3600,"It's different.  TLDR: actual diasporas are different than first or second generation economic migrants.

The reason Western diaspora care more about the Genocide is that the communities in the US and France were traditionally all Genocide survivors.  Like why Ashkenazi care more about the Holocaust that Sephardi.  They were also cut off from Eastern Armenia since it became Soviet.  In Yerevan about half the people have some ancestors from the West but the problems with Azerbaijan and economy are more pressing.

There is more ideological diversity in the diaspora and more polarization than in Armenia, partly just because they have more diverse backgrounds.  Most of them are not recent immigrants, most of them are well-integrated, so their views reflect their respective countries, and the countries they came from before that.  Most of the very liberal voices are diaspora voices.

Turkey has diaspora too, like in Bulgaria or Cyprus, and there are recent economic immigrants from post-Soviet Armenia.  But the proportions are reversed.

Torries ? May is more liberal than most liberals here. 

in Germany ?

Afd? they are joke. 

Merkel ? while compared to May,she indeed is a conservative, she wouldn't be called a conservative or a even center right in any conservative or right leaning country. 

and same is the case for most of western European countries.

https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/06/19/the-discreet-charm-of-the-interior-ministry/

&gt;In Austria, the FPÖ now controls the defence and foreign ministries in addition to the interior—and it has wasted no time in exploiting its power. In March a special unit of the Austrian police raided the domestic security service, the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz und Terrorismusbekämpfung (BVT). They also carried out raids on the homes of five BVT officials, including its director, Peter Gridling. The action was supposedly triggered by the BVT’s alleged mishandling of secret information and improper monitoring of the far Right. As Reuters reported, “The case has caused a political uproar amid fears the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), which became the junior partner in the governing coalition in December, sought to secure intelligence on right-wing groups or sideline political opponents within the BVT—accusations it denies.”

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-austria-politics-security-germany/germany-may-reassess-intelligence-ties-with-austria-over-police-raids-idUSKBN1GX2AJ
&gt;Germany’s BfV domestic intelligence agency will have to reassess its ties with Austria if information it passed on was seized during police raids on its Austrian counterpart, the Interior Ministry in Berlin said.
The statement, made on Tuesday, is the first public indication that the case, which has set off a political storm in Austria, could also harm the country’s access to foreign intelligence.
Prosecutors have placed five employees at Austria’s BVT intelligence agency under investigation based on accusations they failed to delete sensitive information and may have intended to pass it on.
But the case has prompted accusations by the opposition of a purge at the BVT by the far-right Freedom Party (FPO), which controls the Interior Ministry.

Augsburg was one of the richest cities in Europe. To be more exact, the Fuggers were the richest dynasty in Europe, period, and that was just one of the families. The Fuggers finances the armies of Spain, the Holy Roman Emperor, the Papal State, a small colony in the Americas and in general ensured that Augsburg, despite its small territory, could rival Venice and the Hansa in wealth and desirability. 

Literally none of that is in the game. Augsburg is portrayed as a generic ""Divine Focus"" OPM with the wrong flag (it's missing the green cedar nut, which had been included before 1444), and that's not even close. Yes, there's a Bishopric, but throughout the religious turmoil, the city itself was mainly protestant, which led to the Bishop moving his seat to the town of Dillingen for quite a while, because the countryside was more catholic.

Plus, many events in history centered around this city, again, nothing of that in ingame.

The so called revolution was backed and supported by Western powers from its very roots, namely, the US, France, UK, and Italy and I disagree that the situation was headed towards civil war without such support of revolutionary movements by Western powers. It’s a very similar situation to the failed Iranian revolution in 2008 (I think that’s the year) with different outcomes. I think it’s very easy to say that if we didn’t overthrow Gaddafi a war might have happened but this is all hypothetical.

&gt;Which is why they ruled Turkey for decades by sending tanks to the streets and the military police to houses and mosques whenever it was necessary.

That's what Erdogan has been doing in some Kurdish regions...

&gt;As long as people like you don't understand that Erdogan wins because the majority of Turks knows how much worse it is when the alternative to Erdogan wins, you'll never understand anything about Turkey and will keep producing that cringy over-emotional drivel.

&gt;Until there's an option that's actually less authoritarian than Erdogan, Westerns should be happy he keeps winning. 

Except that CHP wasn't the only option in the election. You are trying to sell that this was an Erdogan vs CHP. There are many other options and most are way better than Erdogan. 

Listen, I've already heard that argument a thousand times:

""X is the lesser bad""

""Foreign people do not understand that X is way worse than they think""

And that is the typical argument you will use to justify shit that would under normal circunstances not be  accepted. Saying that in a country with over 80 milion people the best option for democracy is a guy who's objetive is to destroy it is a pretty bold statement.

As a ""Western"" I might not be an expert in Turkish politics but I'm not stupid. And you are prettending I am. So please next time use real arguments not ones entirely based on prejudices

Edit: Just realized you didn't even try to deny this were unfair elections. You only said that Erdogan was better than everyone else. That tells people a lot about your mentality.

Anyway, I agree about capitalism, but Erdogan is more pro-capitalist than the alternatives. As for secularism, it depends - Erdogan is pretty secularist in the traditional sense of public policy decisions not requiring the sanction of rleigious leaders. In the sense of being anti-religious, that's no guarantee whatsoever - some of the worst, most bloodthirsty regimes in the history of mankind, much worse than Erdogan, were extremely secular in that sense. 

&gt;Now after you're done Googling, go look at the Muslim world. Muslim countries are nothing but shit-holes. They don't give a fuck about human rights. They don't give a fuck about women, homosexuals, apostates or non-believers, and on top of that they have shit economy and shit education. And don't even mention Kuwait or any of those other shit Arab countries... Go look at their gross income per capita levels and you'll understand what I mean.

Google what?

I have no sympathy for Islam, and especially not for Islamists. That said, I have no sympathy for totalitarians  who believe religious people should be oppressed or killed either. And the alternatives to Erdogan are either hardcore Islamists who would turn Turkey into a Sunni Iran and guys who would happily massacre people because they're religious. 

 I don't think you know anything about Turkey, or pretty much anything at all for that matter. I'd happily be against Erdogan if the alternative to him was Margaret Thatcher or Tony Blair, or Ged Schröder or Angela Merkel. But they aren't.

The CHP and Kemalists had the media and all governmental institutions with the help of the army on a tight leash (pretty much the same situation with Erdogan but for decades it wasn't Erdogan but the ""secularists"". Now the tides have turned and the religious people don't want to go back to those times. Those days are engraved in the societal mind and that's the reason why Erdogan gets this much votes.

Scotland being in the EU, if they rejoined, would not make up for leaving the UK. This is just mad logic, a tiny fraction of Scotlands trade is with the EU (17% of exports, even less of imports). Most trade is, unsurprisingly, with the UK (61%, more for imports). As I said before, this is Brexiteer logic on steroids. Can't you see the logical disconnect with being pro-EU and pro-independence?

Scotland would have a massive deficit if they left the UK, their budget is currently subsidised. The oil price would have to rise a lot for that not to be the case.

Scotland couldn't use the pound without UK permission. It simply wouldn't work. This is not propaganda, it is simply the truth of the matter.

As a further twist the parliament was split right down the middle in a lot of issues leaving the deciding vote to the man who loathed politics so much he mocked it by jokingly put his name on the ballot for parliament.

A standing joke in parliament was that every time negotiations between the various political parties was unresolved the chairman would say: ""I guess we will have to ask Jacob then"". To which the various political negotiators would say: ""Lets give it another go and see if we can reach a compromise"".

If memory serves me right Jacob only cast the deciding vote once in his 4 years in parliament.

4204,"&gt; Do you think domestic consumption is not fullfilled before exports markets are sought out? 

you can certainly just loosen up regulations and/or taxes domestically in the EU to create this demand? we are talking measures to deal with Trump tariffs in the short term. 


long term these tariffs impact the price of manufactured goods in America as well, this will push those productions out of the US, thereby over time compensating for those tariffs. if Trump insists on constantly taxing his citizens for buying our products, it will become more efficient for those companies, that export from the US to move abroad. 


completely aside from this issue, what is best for the EU economy is obviously to remove all tariffs unilaterally. we should do this regardless of the tariffs or trade policy of other countries, since it simply allows EU consumers to buy those products they deem the best. i see no reason, other than actual hostile military actions or very severe human rights infringements, why we can't benefit from these kinds of trade.

&gt;Now, after more than half a century, it's time to look at the results and compare the different migrant groups. And as you probably know already, the European migrants generally perform better than the non-European ones across the board.

That is a completely wrong assessment: the Italians came in the 50’s and 60’s, when the economy was booming. And when they started making money, the Italians were no longer interested in working in the mines and the factories. So we brought in Turks and Moroccans at the end of the 60’s and early 70’s. 

And then the oil crisis hit, which meant that the MENA immigrants never got the chances the Italians got.

4346,"We can go back and forth all day, but thank you for admitting the disingenuousness. *YOU* are the ones yelling about ""Will of the People"" - which is my point. It's not my fucking will. It's not 16 million people's will, and that number's growing. So stop saying it's ""The Will of the People"", as again, only 26% of the people in the UK voted for this shit. 

Not my disingenuousness, pal. 


I don't hate the fact that ""the majority of people voted differently to you"". Nope. I hate the fact that you were lied to, to get your Leave vote. You were lied to. They LIED to you. That NHS lie was a disgrace and should never, ever be forgotten. Many leave voters were furious that they'd been conned. Around 600,000 of them could've switched their vote if they knew they were being sold snake oil by conmen, and that's the result reversed. Again. Narrow. And again, *lies*. Fuck them. 

You talk about referendum rules as if they're set in stone forever, even though we hardly ever have them. The Scots allowed 16 and 17 year olds to vote in their Indy Ref. Why were they then denied a vote in the Euro Ref? They don't have futures? And Brits who've emigrated/ married and moved abroad, have they stopped being British now? What happens to their kids? The fact they are where they are because we're in Europe now? That's their worlds turned upside down but by all means, disenfranchise them because you don't think their opinions count. 

The implication of ""Will of the people"" suggests it's *all* people. If you can't see the inherent subtext here and what's being telegraphed when the Leave side yell this; namely that this was unanimous and emphatic across the country, then you're either being wilfully dishonest, or you're ignorant. Where are 16 million people in the phrase, ""THE PEOPLE VOTED TO LEAVE!""

I was angry that the referendum was even being held, due to it being nothing more than a Tory ploy to cling on to power. I saw the lies belching out, and saw the twin scapegoats of immigrants, and the great Brussels bogeyman as the reasons for all Britain's ills. I fucking *knew* that NHS line was a lie, and I could see people were being manipulated. Some very dark forces were being stirred up, manifested in outright, overt racism that came out the day after the vote. 


I can say if Remain won, I would've breathed a sigh of relief, but I knew it wouldn't be the end of it from Leavers. Farage infamously said the month before the referendum that ""In a 52-48 referendum this would be unfinished business by a long way."" 

So good for you for saying ""my stance would be exactly the same if the roles were reversed"" because Leave and Nigel Farage wouldn't let this go either.

4391,"I don't expect the EU to do us any favours, nor believe they should. Let's make that clear. But please read again the comment I was replying to.

&gt; The EU clearly has interest in making any leavers hurt bad. Because that's gonna keep others from leaving.

A country should have the sovereignty to decide whether they would like to be an EU member or not. If they are in, they get the perks, if they want out, they do not. That is of course completely logical.

What I don't agree with however, is the EU deliberately trying to make an example out of the UK. To try and make the process as painful as possible in order to deter other countries from doing the same.

To go back to your analogy. Of course the gym will withdraw its services if you stop paying membership. But if you do want to leave it should respect your wishes to leave, and it certainly should not try and make it difficult for you to find a new gym in order to stop other members getting similar ideas.

You might not believe that's what the EU is doing, fine. But that is the sentiment that I was disagreeing with. 

Punishing leavers unnecessarily is how cults operate and survive, and if that is how the EU feels they need to operate in order to prevent members leaving then it is not something I want to be a part of.",,/r/europe/comments/8tc380/im_moved_by_her_honesty/e17poyd/,riplorne,1529854017

Do you really believe that the number includes all of the immigrants and not only the ones whose applications have been accepted? I bet that the 2nd figure is what you're referring to and it's most likely a small percentage of the number of migrants in Italy. It sucks being on the frontier.

On the other hand, immigrants coming from the Balkan route want to go to Italy.

Over 2 million migrants poured into Europe during 2015-16 migrant crisis. Do you live under a rock? That is on top of already very generous migrant fluxes from regular migration. With climate change and population explosion affecting Africa, we can expect a lot more of this in the future.

But if its a fantasy flag, why were you so ruffled by it ? Its a fantasy no ? :)

Im glad you conceded they acted like savages. That's progress.

&gt;Neither the fans or the players were ever assaulted or villified in the stadium and outside of it. A group of fans of 20 something yo gave an interview saying how they expected hell and instead found themselves invited over peoples homes for food. How many albanian fans were allowed in Belgrade because it was safe for them? Also : Muh drone again....

Source. 

&gt;No I much preffer the serbian tradition of killing ones own father in the woods. Much more humane and european really.

Even tho i have no idea what you're talking about, nice to see you don't refuse you have a culture of revenge killings....in the 21st century, jesus.  

&gt;Are you done giving yourself value? I already explained it to you, stop wasting time.

Wasting time...as in mentioning me in threads im not even in? That's obsession 101 dude, you can find a thread where i mentioned you, ill wait.  

&gt;Are you living in Kosovo? Were you aware that montenegro has more ISIS fighters x muslim population than Kosovo? Were you also aware that the only Radical Muslim party in Kosovo got 0.54% of the votes from a country considered to be 90% muslim? Or what about the fact that radicalism has been exposed as being directly funded by Belgrade? Like this : https://i.imgur.com/3o2jSBA.jpg

Any proof he's from Belgrade? We can have Muslim radicals as well. 

Ofc theres no proof because so far you backed 0 proof for every and each of your claims. 

&gt;https://www.indy100.com/article/belgium-provided-the-most-isis-fighters-per-capita-of-all-eu-countries-last-year--b1yD_bwvtx

You're right, i apologize, it's Bosnia, then Kosovo then Albania. 

&gt;Read the above reply, just like you should read the National and International Data that from those 300 confirmed people who moved to Syria 100 have been Confirmed to have moved to Syria to move to Saudi, and some 100 of them returned and turned themselves in.

Can't find this anywhere. But the NY times has a fun article on the [subject](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/world/europe/how-the-saudis-turned-kosovo-into-fertile-ground-for-isis.html)  

&gt;You are again adding up a new deflection to the subject at hand. But if you are so concerned about our ecosystem I must tell you that news article was debunked just like this one was:

&gt;https://exit.al/en/2017/08/07/albania-is-drowning-in-trash/ 

Here's an Albanian website with the more or less same article. 
CAn i see where the other one was debunked? Or no source again?

&gt;But two can play the same game. Maybe we can go rafting sometimes : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUU51PR5wK0

everybody has trash, but not everybody has enough trash to endanger a whole other country that it doesnt' even border.

&gt;Are you sure you are not racist Helskrim :) 

Economy is not racist, Albania is lagging behind FYROM by $1000 already in gdp per capita, more in gdp ppp, and FYROM will soon be unblocked from the EU by Greece, thus gain even more advantage. But i like that whenever confroneted with facts you go with 'racist'. 
&gt;Remember when I said you are trying hard to change the subject because you lost the first one? This is it. If you want proof of our development and how we are on the same level we can discuss that on another thread. Now, to the subject at hand:

Convinient for you, but i am curious about the metrics, why not link them? Could it be because...they don't exist?

- These pretty boys were responsible for it. Will you cover them ?

None of these are chanting 'Kill the Albanians' and on the game like you said, so again, you were lying.  

&gt;As I already said above its for another thread, but to put it lightly EU offered us to join them on 2 occasions IF we agreed to their terms. We denied both terms twice. So it not about who deserves it but who is the most useful/strategical solution. Case n point Montenegro.

Right, another 'convenient' thing.  

&gt;Don't bullshit here. Don't make me copy paste that shitstain comment you made after telling me you re not racist and when I called you out on it you never re appeared, or the shitstains yoOr is this considered stalking too?

So you can copy that imaginary comment but you can't link some metrics, how does that even make sense?









&gt;Have you ever considered that you and a few others of the brigade were so adamant on the previous Serbia thread that when one that called you out was posted you were nowhere in sight? None of you were? You can check the thread again, I have 0 comments calling you or mentioning you in that thread, others did.

Also vaccines are administered in MENA countries too and some organizations make sure children arriving in Italy have them as well.

It's pretty obvious there's some anti-vax sentiment in some European countries and this varies seemingly randomly (Sweden higher vaccine rate than Norway for example) and that's why you see low rates in different countries.

4562,"France:

Politics:

- **Immigration is dominating the news.**

After last week and the Aquarius, the issue is still at the center of the political debate. Macron met with the Spanish PM and with Merkel. Macron criticized Salvini and the ""mounting leprosy in Europe"" (referring to eastern european governments). 

- **Emmanuel Macron reprimanded a teen**.

Macron was taking part in a ceremony commemorating Charles de Gaulle's Appeal of 18 June 1940. There were kids behind the barriers as the President was shaking hands. A 14 year-old boy was singing the Internationale as he approached and then the following dialogue happened: 

Teen: ""How is it going, Manu?"" 

Macron: ""No, you can't do that, no, no, no, no."" 

Teen: ""Sorry Mr President"". 

Macron: ""You're here, at an official ceremony. You ('ve got to) behave. So you can behave like an imbecile, but today it's the Marseillaise and the  Chant des Partisans, you call me 'Mr President of the Republic' or 'Mr/Sir'. Okay?"" 

Teen: ""Yes, sir"".

Macron: ""Good. And you do things in the right order. The day you want to do the revolution, you first learn to have a degree and to feed yourself, okay? And then you'll give lessons to others"".

Then Macron posted the video on his official twitter account. Which led to lots of comments: some saying it was a very good thing to assert his authorithy that way, others saying it was beneath him to do such a PR stunt and publicizing the video of a minor who wasn't that rude and who had apologized. 

- **Marine Le Pen, President of the 'National Gathering' far-right party ordered to repay 300,000 euros to the European Parliament.**

For claiming to employ a parliamentary assistant that failed to provide any services.

(The ""National Gathering"" or ""Rassemblement National"" is the new name of the ""National Front, btw. They changed it last month).

- **Criticism against the President of the LR party (main right-wing opposition party), who is accused of being too right-leaning and divisive**.

Laurent Wauquiez is the President of the 'Les Républicains' party and he hasn't managed to reinforce his party's status (since their defeat during the presidential election): the opposition is still weak, the public opinion doesn't approve of him. 

Last month a political flyer created a controversy. It reads: [""So that France remains France""](https://photos2.tf1.fr/660/370/quotidien-france-reste-france-nouveau-tract-de-laurent-wauquiez-inspire-fn-49483c-0@1x.jpg)... which has clear far-right influences... Virginie Calmels, Vice-President of the party (who represents a more moderated line), first defended it but then last week she criticized Wauquiez, saying he's too divisive and is only representing his own stance. Wauquiez fired her. Most people seem to disapprove, according to the polls.

**Causes pollution:** The article makes two points; carbon dioxide and cutting down wood. Neither is a problem. Paper is made in countries like Finland and Sweden, both are negative net pollutants due to our vast greens. We also do not cut down forests for good. For every tree cut down another is planted. Why? Because forestry is a great and lucrative business. We wouldn't have as many trees as we have now if not for forestry.

**Consumes energy:** This is valid. But all energy is not equal, and all energy consumption is not wasteful. It directly depends on the source.

**Consumes water:** This has no impact in countries with an abundance of water and healthy earthmounds. Water consumed doesn't disappear anywhere, it's water that is set to be cleaned again, exactly how it has been for billions of years. That's a problem in many countries, but not in Finland or Sweden.

**Inefficient recycling:** This is only effective measurement if both are recycled. That is not the case, much of plastic ends up in nature being a highly evasive ingredient destabilising entire ecosystems. Paper doesn't do this as its biodegradable.

**Produces waste:** The article states paper is worse because the quantity of ""waste"" is bigger. - Waste is not a standardised term! Plastic is a thousand times worse waste than paper if left in nature.

4718,"Shout out to u/nilsz - have copied the article below and highlighted the *incriminating* sentences;

&gt;The most important thing to understand about the Russia scandal is that it perfectly fits a clear pattern of behavior. What Vladimir Putin is accused of doing to help Donald Trump win the presidency is essentially identical to what he is either accused of or proven to have done to help many other right-wing candidates in many other countries. As the plot in the United States is slowly exposed, a remarkably similar one in the United Kingdom is quickly surfacing.

&gt;Months before the United States narrowly elected Trump, the United Kingdom narrowly elected to withdraw from the European Union. Both votes advanced Russian foreign policy goals — in the latter case, by splitting up the Western alliance. (Trump has energetically pursued this strategy, too.) Russia employed many of the same tools to influence both elections. It deployed social-media bots and trolls to spread its message. It recruited friendly candidates who gave voice to previously marginal Russophile positions. And, as the newly surfaced evidence suggests, it indirectly financed the campaign.

&gt;British magnate Arron Banks supported the Brexit campaign with the largest political donation in British history. Leaked documents obtained by British reporter Carole Cadwalladr suggest Banks had more than mere philanthropic motives for this donation. Banks met several times with representatives of the Russian government, contradicting his previous claim to have met with Russians just one time.

&gt;More significantly, the documents suggest the Russians dangled a lucrative business deal. He would have the chance to buy in to a gold-mining consolidation, “potentially netting a profit of several billion dollars.” Banks denies that the gold deal ever happened, or that any of the meetings included any surreptitious collusion. “It’s a convenient political witch-hunt, both over Brexit and Trump,” he insists, using the same term favored by Trump.

&gt;To say that Bank’s defenses appear suspicious is a substantial understatement. If his meetings were innocent, why did he lie? If he never consummated the Russian gold-mining deal, why did he tweet at the time that he was investing in a big gold-mining deal?

&gt;The unfolding scandal in Britain contains many of the hallmarks of Russian covert influence elsewhere. The Russians are not manufacturing an issue out of whole cloth — nationalism clearly has an authentic popular basis — but instead use their influence to magnify it. They cloak their influence behind undisclosed meetings and hidden financial transfers. And when their partners’ lies about their contacts are exposed, they insist they lied for no apparent reason and have nothing else to hide.

&gt;The dangling of the gold-mine deal likewise reflects a classic Putin-era Russian strategy. The most lucrative sectors of Russia’s oligarch-driven economy involve monopolies over natural resources. They are the perfect bait for functional bribes. Russia can send businessmen, who may be operating with quiet support or control from the Kremlin, to offer deals that promise guaranteed profits. And those profits can be cover to inject Russian money into the West. If Banks was promised a lucrative gold-mining deal, as it appears, then he may have functioned as essentially a pass-through, enabling Russia to finance the Brexit referendum.

&gt;Trump has many surface ties to the Brexiteers. He has met with Banks and the nationalist leader Nigel Farage. He has echoed their rhetoric and even their cause, labeling himself “Mr. Brexit.” But more revealing is the pattern of similarities below the surface. The covert meetings, the endless false denials that they took place at all, the patina of legitimate business discussions, and the web of undisclosed financial ties. To believe that neither Trump nor Banks colluded directly with Russia in 2016 is to believe in an awful lot of strange coincidences.

We were promised the earth and outright lied to during the Brexit referendum and no-one is being held to account for this. They said the health service would get £350 million a week. They lied; it’s not. They said we would stay in the Single Market. They lied; they want us out. They said we’d be a sovereign country again. They lied; we are sovereign and parliament has always had the final say. 

The Brexit referendum was many things to many people. Racist? We’ll chuck out the immigrants. Poor/unemployed? There’ll be jobs *everywhere*.  It was a fantasy land that anyone could pin their hopes and dreams to.

No more lies, no more false promises. 

The People’s Vote would then be to agree, or throw it away and crash out (“hard” Brexit), or rip it all up and Remain.

The losses from the Social Democrats to the AfD are significant, but half as large as the losses of the Conservatives, or even the far-left. Nationalism isn't a Social Democratic policy, and even if all those voters would have stayed with the SPD the party would still be in shambles. The SPD lost it's most significant chunk of votes after the introduction of the Hartz reforms in early 2000s

https://bundestagswahl-2017.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SPD-Ergebnisse-bei-Bundestagswahlen-von-1990-bis-2017-1.png

The reason was a switch towards elimination of the welfare state. It's unrelated to migration. The SPD never changed their position on migration and the topic wasn't really relevant in Germany in the mid or late 2000s. 

&gt;I mean, not to be rude, but do white working class people care about gay marriage and gender equality?

yes. The White working class isn't just a group of peons that flock to populists. If you look at the refugee politics of Merkel, it has significant support from SPD members. That's an issue for conservative voters and their base, not social democrats. The average AfD voter isn't even a member of the working class but rather a peculiar mix of upper middle class conservatives, nationalists, the precariat and other demographics that have little in common.

I asked you to look at this specific incident without comparing it to Serbian fans antics yet you start your response with exactly just that. Makes me wonder if you have a personal thing against Serbs which is making it hard for you look at this incident from a neutral pov. 

You must not be from the Balkans. Flags and symbols of countries that you are in conflict with can and are considered offensive. Take a Serbian flag to Croatia and you will see what I mean. 

“gesture is done in most occasions. “

You’re definitely not getting it. Sure the gestures can be seen in a positive light IN THE RIGHT SETTING. You said it yourself “most occasions”. In a stadium filled with Serbian fans and hooligans playing against Serbia is definitely not the right occasion for it. 

I can’t make this point anymore simpler for you. 

“If anyone needs to get fined is the Serbian FA for its fans chanting”

Once again, you can’t discuss this incident without constantly going on this anti-Serbian hooligan rant. I’ll say it again- I’ve never once defended Serbian hooliganism. They were fined after the first game against Costa Rica. They will get fined for the game against Switzerland. Comparing Serbian hooligans to professional soccer players is quite a reach.

5023,"Ughh I hate that word “exceptional.” In everyday common English, the word has a popular definition that means “the best.” But that’s not what the concept originally meant.

The idea of American exceptionalism, or European exceptionalism, or any country’s self professed “exceptionalism”, is just the idea that our nation/Union (be it Europe or America) has some kind of unique challenge and responsibility that other nations simply don’t have because our histories are different. One is not better or worse, each project is important as a means to build a model system for the rest of the world to study and apply in order to improve the human condition. American exceptionalism, to me, means that because of our unique nature as a country of immigrants, we have an exceptional responsibility to show the world how a multi ethnic, multi cultural nation can operate. Hopefully, when we succeed, humanity will have proof that diversity doesn’t have to threaten prosperity or identity.

European exceptionalism also exists. It is a much more modern concept and it’s just as important: how do 28 nations - who’s people have fought for thousands of years, speaking different languages, and with a resolute desire to maintain sovereignty - create a political union that can mend historical tensions and create a union of peace and prosperity for their posterity. 

Same goes for Chinese exceptionalism “how does an isolated nation, based on authoritarian values, manage to develop, reform, and find a place with the same world powers that had previously abused its people?” And African exceptionalism “how does a diverse continent, plagued with civil wars, corruption, and centuries of colonialism and exploitation, manage to finally stand on its feet and prosper.”

That’s the original idea. Instead, nationalists on all sides always take this term and use it as a ruler to measure their dicks. ",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8tcx9n/its_not_america_thats_exceptional_its_europe/e16uqrw/,sloanj1400,1529803069

The mafias in Libya just send them out on rafts with enough gasoline to get to international waters and don't give a fuck if they die since they already got paid.

We can't keep giving these perverse incentives and then acting like they have no effect.

What Italians really find hard to accept about immigrants is that they stay in groups, often 'stealing' our jobs or becoming criminals, but that really wouldn't happen if they would get integrated in the Italian society.

There already aren't enough jobs for Italians. How are they to divide the pie even more while keeping a basic standard of living? These are not entrepreneurs with capital in boats coming from Africa. They are desperately trying to compete for the same scarce number of decent paying low-skill jobs, which will soon become even more rare due to automation. When you start messing with people's livelihoods, the poor and middle class will see it as a declared war on them. The upper classes don't care; they have equity, property, beach houses, and high-paying jobs requiring degrees, which shield them from the negative effects of low-skill immigration.

5151,"It's a delusion that was caused by the green party who were spear-heading the campaign against nuclear power. After voting ""NO"" for nuclear and choosing R&amp;D in renewable energies, well, everyone thought things will get better and they will, just not fast enough.

Part of my uni study involves looking at renewable energy and it's greatly exaggerated because they just look at potential energy (which are based on models) and assume a lot of things like stable weather (which makes me lol considering global warming and pollution) non-drastic increase in power consumption per capita (which is actually fine for the most part but you need revolutionary changes to be able to match the needs with supply).

Anyway, I kinda went on a rant here, because mass delusions are a sort of trigger. The point is that considering the time it takes to fully develop solar panels, windmills, etc. to the point where you can fully supply households with power, you would need about half a century just to have some decent tech and then the harder part, infrastructure. All of this will just take too long before any positive effect is seen, which makes nuclear the obvious temporary solution. I prefer to use the term ""stepping stone"", to emphasize that fission reactors are not a good long term solution due to the long half life of the nuclear waste, which I think can be managed if we use such reactors for just a century maximum, but of course we might never know what alternative and more powerful nuclear reactors we could have developed if the greens wouldn't have gone ape-shit every time they hear nuclear.

Also, find the study ""THE LABOUR-MARKET PARTICIPATION OF HIGHLY SKILLED IMMIGRANTS IN SWEDEN: AN OVERVIEW"" by Irastoza &amp; Bevelander (2017). Check Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. There is a 20 point gap between foreign borns and Swedes at the same educational level. The gap is even bigger for Swedes and non-citizens, again at the same educational level. I'll just quote from the conclusions in the paper:
&gt; Our results show that highly skilled immigrants have greater employment levels, relative earnings and education-to-job match compared to lesser- educated immigrants. However, these outcomes are significantly lower than those for highly educated natives. **In fact, native men with low education have higher employment levels than highly educated immigrants.** Furthermore, while years of residency in Sweden improve highly educated immigrants’ employment rates and earnings, **they never catch up with those of natives.**

Other studies that I have read also point out the same problems: lack of opportunities for foreign borns, exclusion through self-employment, lower salaries, etc. I don't know what kind of propaganda pieces you prefer to read, but what I've read does not support your views.

Everyone feels there are men like this. Maybe they’re Irish. Maybe they’re Somalians. It’s men who make order. They’re called tyrants. When the tyrants are overthrown people fear there’s too much chaos and lament the lack of tyrants.

We all sit today awaiting tyrants. Left wingers from right wingers, right wingers from foreign places. Everyone expects. longs for them to just show their ugly heads. Enough with the waiting, already!

So? Is the age old call, “Come and make me!” 

That sentiment runs deep through the whole of Western society. Anxiety, depression .. it’s uncertainty from lack of tyrannical order.

And people do prescribe: More liberalism! But I’d caution that’s how you get someone like Hitler, when the need for tyranny is too overly repressed. 

America won’t go Nazi-fascist because they have Trump. The population there loves to have the tyrant to loathe. 

So? Is the call to the right wingers to go sit under the sword of Damocles, be tyrants in Europe .. basically do it now, do it lightly, pull the spring back, or you’ll pull it all the way till it snaps.

5173,"&gt; First of all, the ""they are older"" does not imply objectively more important

That's ludicrous, that's precisely the *most concrete* way something can be objectively important. Age isn't changed by personal opinions; age dictates rarity; something surviving to old age is impressive. An old temple is historically more valuable than a new church. An old temple and an old church are equally valuable from a historical perspective.

&gt; we can also deduce that mosque's have been more important and influential because they have been relevant to the region and remain relevant for nearly 500 years now.

The churches remain relevant. They are a large part of Kosovo's current geopolitical situation, as we are having this discussion about them now, and they would be more relevant had the Serbs not been ethnically cleansed from the region.

The comment about ""royal churches"" was merely meant to point out that the provinces are less relevant than the heartland, and that Kosovo has been considered provincial since the time of Medieval Serbia. There actually are equivalents, but those ""royal mosques"" are not found in Kosovo, they're found in Istanbul - and anybody would agree that the Sultan Ahmed Mosque, for instance, is more historically important than a random mosque of similar age in a hinterland region of Central Anatolia. 

I quite honestly don't understand how this is controversial, this is equivalent to placing Aztec pyramids on level with an old colonial Spanish village church.

ummmm...no that sounds like a complete fucking mess why would you even suggest such an odd system? 

I want the commission to stand for election same as the parliment does, anyone could form a group of 28 people and put them self's up for election, every EU citizen would get an equal vote on which of the candidate commissions gets the job.  

The winner would be decided via a list vote electoral system done at the same time as the EU parliament elections for purposes of convenience and to reduce costs. 

Alternatively i would also except scrapping the commission entirely and giving the council and parliament the power to write and submit legislation to a vote so long as MEPs were rebalanced so they each represented roughly the same number of people.

&gt;Oh you remember the game? Do you remember how it went too? How many hooligans, kill the serbs chants, booing at the anthem or denial to accomodate the opposing teams fans did you see? 

0 because it was under intense scrutiny by FIFA and UEFA, also 0 drones.

&gt;Are you done wasting time?

Did i say they weren't chanting? They were, shit kicked up when the Albanians flew the drone. 

&gt;Good to know hooligans are a race now. Will we make therapy groups for them too? Afterall its the current year.

Nah, better we implement one of your trademark revenge killigns, that solves problems. 

&gt;No Helskrim, you just write so much bullshit all over europe in every thread that has Albania and Kosovo in the title that its hard not to see you.

Second, it's seriously not my fault Kosovo is the largest exporter of ISIS fighters per capita. 

&gt;Show me this thread. Show me these Albanians. Show it to me. Its the 5th time you talk to me of albanian brigades and everytime I give you proof you go - Oh ok I didn't know that and do the same comment on another thread.

go and find it, it's still up. 

&gt;A belgian syrian refugee and his migrant pal are not my countrymen. :) But youre still avoiding the question :)

And those 300 others that went to fight in Syria are neither i take it? 

&gt;You use the word concede. I don't think you know what it means. Let me put this in prespective, its not a debate. Its me countering every argument you had so you kept pulling a new one out of your ass on every new comment.

Not really, you just move the goalpost. 

&gt;Double standards much Helskrim? I open a thread, I read it, leave a comment or two if it peaks my interest and leave. How many comments do you have on this thread alone? Projecting what you are doing on other people is pathetic.

I have this many comments because you all keep replying to me. 
You yourself said you missed me in the Liberia thread, and i was mentioned in that thread, THAT is projecting, and it's patethic, but again, not unexpected.

that speaks volumes.  

&gt;We are doing fine and looking better everyday, not that you would know it obv.

A few decades and you might even catch up to FYROM.  

&gt;The only metric you are doing better in are retarded politicians and fantasy Media. The rest is an illusion in your head since you admit personal experience is bull.

Why dont you link those metrics then?

You avoided linkin the fans chanting Kill The Albanians yesterday, now you avoid the metrics. 
I can already tell you we beat you in 90% of those. As i said, we are a frontrunner for a reason.  
Either stop lying or come up with some hard facts, not insults.  

&gt;Geopolitics is the reason behind every move. If you think EU, Russia America or whoever does something out of spite or the kindness of their heart you are kidding yourself.

So why are we going into the EU while you are not? Explain that to me.

That isn't surprising. Lot's more people play soccer than hockey. Hockey is extremely expensive due equipment costs and leauge fees. It costs hundreds of dollars to outfit your kid with a set of hockey equipment, and they grow out of it constantly. It's also a much harder sport, skill wise and physically, so is innacaseble to people not raised playing it.

All you need to play soccer is shoes. I like playing soccer. It's fun, but it's not something I take seriously or care about. And a huge percentage of those players are immigrants and children. Most soccer teams where I live are formed on national basis. The Croation club has a team, the Italians do, etc.

So looking at players doesn't show much. Look at the sports page of a Canadian newspaper. Good luck finding any soccer coverage. Because no one cares. Hockey dominates any sports discussions, and is avidly followed even by people who don't play. Soccer on the other hand is played widely, usually by kids, due to ease.

I think government policy will become more moderate as it has to face the actual business of running the country. Already, there is no more talk about leaving the Euro or the EU. They know that any hint in that direction would increase Italian debt immediately and severely damage the Italian economy. 

Salvini didn't come to power because of any merit of his own. He came to power because the establishment parties failed to pull Italy out off stagnation. 

Unlike the 1930s, there is no international fascist movement he could join. And joining forces with right-wing populists in Poland or Hungary wouldn't help with Italy's refugee problem. 

People keep on ranting about the EU, but even populists know perfectly well that there is no alternative. 

Left-wing populists like Varoufakis had the idea of hijacking the EU for a socialist experiment. They failed to understand the political dynamic of the EU. Today, right-wing populists try to do the same. It's noticeable how many right-wing populists in the East are very pro-EU. They just want a less liberal EU. And their pro-EU stance is not only because of the EU subsidies. The access to the single market is far more important.

In the end, the different political factions will even each other out in the EU to create a consensus at the center.  That is perhaps the greatest thing about the EU. 

The inability of the establishment parties to handle the refugee crisis has brought about a right-wing reaction as a natural corrective.

Sad truth for Italy is that France is currently an issue (the border) and an ally (one of the few country pushing for a relocation scheme). So call France hypocrite as much as you want, the matter is that it is one of the few pushing for a relocation scheme, albeit a limited one. And Italy is stuck with it.

5322,"USA leads in tech. China is catching up but China still has a huge swath of problems to solve before being competitive. 

Automotive is definitely not just European or Asian centric. That is just being willfully ignorant. GM, Ford, Chrysler (yeah Italian owed but world headquarters is in Michigan). It was more of a merger than a takeover. Fiat is still in Europe and everything else is still in America. And Tesla. American auto is doing just fine. Not to mention GM, Ford, and Tesla are making great strides in mobility services while also developing a robust tech sector to develop autonomous capabilities. That is just the old dogs as well. You have Waymo, Nvidia, and Uber all at the forefront of autonomous driving as well. Both GM and Ford are also making great strides in China and when it comes to automarkets, you probably don't want to piss off the second largest automarket in the world in the USA. I tell you what, the German automakers are probably shitting bricks about this trade war right now. Much more so than the American Automakers. Europe just isn't that profitable of a market for the Auto industry.

Secondly, the USA has large amounts of oil, natural gas, and coal which is still going to be needed largely in the future regardless of any clean energy initiatives. Just look at this report. This isn't some scrub media article. EIA is a government research division. It doesn't get paid to put a spin on things.
 https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/0383(2017).pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwji5dPHuOrbAhWm4IMKHfxfCW0QFjAAegQIBBAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw1rrvvn2ANxU_GDguEwycAQ

Finally, you are forgetting that the USA not only leads in pharmaceuticals. It also leads in medical research and advanced medical technology. We have the best medical facilities in the world both for care and research. 

The USA also leads in space and aerotech. SpaceX, NASA, and blue origins all making large strides in rocket design while Lockheed Martin and Boeing lead in the development of military and commercial aircraft.

Moving on, the US military industrial complex is the most advanced and well funded in the world. Not to mention that the entire global positioning system (all of the satilletes that all for your Google maps to work) are under US military control. We have more aircraft carriers than every nation combined. We have military bases on every single contient and in more countries than any other nation in the world. The US military is not only the most technologically advanced, it is also the most mobile and readily deployable. You don't see China with a military base in Mexico, Canada, Cuba, ect... and yet America surrounds China with bases in South Korea, Japan, and Australia with strategic alliances with India and Vietnam. China's reach is regional, America's is global. 

We have the largest telescope in space, the hubble, and we are soon going to have an even larger telescope in space, the James Web.

We have some of the most advanced robotics research facilities in the world as well. Just look at MIT and Boston dynamics. 

We also have the best universities in the world.

America also has the land and agricultural resources to feed its population especially if you combine that with the land and agricultural resources of both Mexico and Canada. 

Should I continue because I could. Obviously, other countries are leading in a field or two maybe competing in more but never in the history of the world has a nation been as dominant in every field as America has been and still is.

5336,"&gt;Stadium reacted because those savages like started beating our footballers who were taking the flag down,

A football team bullies and beats up entire stadium. I don't know if to laugh or cry.

&gt; the flag is tiny, can't be really seen from the stadium.

Really helskrim? Would you like a link to the game when the drone shows up and the stadium begins to roar like raging elephants?

&gt;Not really. Can you provide why else wouldn't he play for the Albanian national team?

Your points are as weak as they are futile.
He was born and raised in switzerland and is a swedish citizen. He has albanian roots and is proud of it hence the symbol. He was offered the chance to play for Albania but declined due to the FSHF wanting him to pay to play. He has played in the friendly Kosovo VS Albania match. So whats your point now? He should not be allowed to be proud of his roots and make Albanian symbols because he is a citizen of another country? Should we apply this to every person serbian people included?

&gt;Enlighten me so i can report you.

HAH Are you really touched over me offending a bunch of hooligans.

&gt;Can i fake the FM being there and talking about revoking Kosovo on video? No.Can you fake a website? Yes.You decide.

Dacic was the one that gave you the news, the video is the rep speaking and then being covered by serbian dub. If you still believe Dacic and his theories I already gave you the answer. 

&gt;Presevo was never Albanian (stop butchering names dude), Kosovo is disputed, and Hungary signed off on Vojvodina,

Presheva, Bujanovc, Medvegja, Molla Kuqe and others of this region are of historically albanian Majority. If you can't handle the fact that these districts were handled and controlled by Albanian Vilayets then you need to go out more. 

&gt;No Greater Albania today sorry, Albania stays small.

Who knows what tomorrow has in store :)

&gt;It's not my logic, everybody says it's a disputed territory. Hence why we have talks about it - Brussels talks.

Nobody gives a flying fuck about who does and doesn't recognise kosovo but you. 

&gt;Nobody chanted Kill the Albanians yesterday.

Sure jan.

&gt;But Albanians and Croatians chanted Kill the Serbs on a match that didn't even feature Serbia or Serbs, talk about envy and obsession.

Albanians and Croatians chanted kill the serbs over a match that happened after one of their antics. Similarly Serbia set a blaze an entire stadium that didn't feature Albania in Italy and showed off their vocal cords in a game with no Albanians in sight:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBuDS5RyW1g

&gt;never said you are not allowed, everyone is allowed, but you're defending a Kosovar and implying Kosovar and Albanian are two different things.

Now I know you are schizophrenic. You go from one point to another whilst demanding answer for both. A kosovar is a resident and citizen of kosovo, he may be of serbian or albanian descent and identify as either depending on origins. What people of another country do is beyond you and ours juristiction.

&gt;That would be you guys. Since a curious amount of albanians and downvotes showed up in r/serbia to downvote/upvote a thread and comment.

No offense Helskrim, but you are insufferable as a person in general, and I say this after seeing you comment blabber on r/serbia and r/europe so don't blame us for getting downvoted for stating an unpopular opinion.

&gt;Again lol, obsession is a thing here it seems.

Ikr its almost like you are talking to every guy on this thread that has a different oppinion on the matter. Or that one time you were the only comment on an ISIS incident. Projecting much?

&gt;I take discussion seriously, not Reddit itself.

You shouldn't you are not very good at it.

&gt;Lol like we never lost in football right? i wish, but hey, losing a WC match is so much better than not making the WC ever...in 70 damn years.

I was referring to you Helskrim, not the football. You mention WC, EU and other crap out of the blue constantly.Did the loss and Shaqiri really drill your ass that hard? Because if you didn't care you wouldn't be stalking every single thread on this subject.

&gt;We are not, we didn't lose that many people, all other neighbors lost much more due to immigration, except maybe Montenegro.

Serbia is currently suffering from population centralisation and migration aka. the youth is leaving and the rest are concentrating in Belgrade Vojvodina, leaving south Serbia empty, which is why there was such a ruckus 2 years ago when Albanians were buying land in south serbia.

&gt;Good news for you then i guess, since you won't join either.
It has to do with you being so frustrated (not you personally) but others as well.

Good news for me and everyone else in here since we wont put up with the migrant bullshit. If you do join EU then enjoy the migrant wave from Berlin with love.

&gt;Nah dude, we're better in almost every metric.

You should get out of your house more, I know you are very narrow minded and ignorant when it comes to us in general, but you really should visit sometime. Never heard of a serbian complain, actually the opposite they were surprised.

 &gt;We're poorer than the EU countries, but there's a reason why we're frontrunners to it.

You should search about geopolitics.

Again you are comparing the players to the fans, if Shaqiri and Xhaka have the minds of hooligans they should be off the pitch. 

NO serbian PLAYER on the field wore a map of Kosovo and neither did any provocative handsigns even when the Swiss team did them.

Hooligans do hooligan stuff as usual and all i see in these threads is that all serbs and serb players branded as maniacs when they were the only players on the pitch not wearing anything provocative or doing provocative handsigns?

I repeat NO serbian PLAYER on the field wore a map of Kosovo and neither did any provocative handsigns even when the Swiss team did them.

And somehow serbians are the bad ones cause of hooligans? 

I care what they do on the PITCH I don't see the shitty fan signs on TV. Both serbian and albanian hooligans have no common decency and players should stay out of it.

Kosovar Swiss did not stay out of provocation and resorted to questionable behavior and tried to be inflammatory and the serbian team wore no signs and did nothing and all i see is hate threads.

5380,"Most europeans still consider the US to be an ally. We are well aware that Trump isnt supported by the majority of americans and lost by millions of votes to Hillary Clinton. People on this subreddit doesnt really represent what Europeans in general think of the US, you have to remember that this sub attracts people who generally subscribe to the idea of the EU which most europeans dont care much for. If i remember correctly most polls show that the majority of americans support Nato and the EU as well. The people who question the EU-US relationship on this subreddit are certaintly not the majority of Europeans, just a very vocal minority that wants to pursue a more independent foreign policy or be more aligned towards Russia/China. Trump is a dick and is certaintly weakening the alliance by quite a bit, but people forget that the EU and the US agree on way more than we disagree on. We work together in terms of scientific development, we sell weapons to each other because we trust eachother and we largely pursue the same foreign policy goals and our economies are tighly linked. Again, the people on this subreddit doesnt represent the majority of europeans. My country, Norway, is still a strong ally of the US despite of Trump. In fact, we recently signed a large arms deal with the US showing that we still trust them.

What remains to be seen however is if the president after Trump will continue to pursue the same policies as him. If that happens people can start questioning the EU-US relationship, however, given that the majority of Americans disapprove of Trump and still supports Nato and a more assertive US on the world stage i doubt that will happen.",Norway,/r/europe/comments/8t8p4w/so_its_time_time_eu_citizens_to_do_their_part/e16cllc/,Pleasedont__,1529781871

Beginning of this year the law was changed. Bars are now allowed to sell beer and wine directly to customers to take with. However sell must happen ""inside"" the premises, so this guy uses a loophole: he established a bar inside his truck. However to sell his beer, customers have to actually step inside to buy.

5386,"&gt;	The first person to mention the empire in a discussion about Brexit loses. Wanting to be a normal self governing country.

Wrong. Everyone who discusses about Brexit has to know that the poisoned relationship between Britain and the EU has its roots in an inferiority complex of the British. 

Churchill wanted Britain to function as a leader or parent to the EU. This is why de Gaulle vetoed the British applications again and again. And every decision Britain has made since joining the EU was lead by old sentiment for being not a but THE negotiating party and by the idea of only profiting monetarily and not really contributing to the idea of a European Union. 

We got the US and China as leading economic powers. I wish you all the best in finding your place as one, (globally seen quite) insignificant negotiating party in the world. Where are Australia and NZ when it comes to world politics? Japan is also facing economic problems right now. And that‘s just the economic side. Leaving the EU will be a loss in cultural exchange for Britain and the EU. That‘s even worse than the economic difficulties, in my opinion.

5395,"Polish people and other Eastern Europeans aren't directly causing social problems or cultural clashes as a result of their behaviour in the UK or anything like how a large section of the Pakistani community is, but in large enough numbers they have an unfortunate indirect negative impact.

Freedom of movement is one of the biggest reasons that there has been so little wage growth in the UK over the last ten to 15 years. Freedom of movement has allowed hundreds of thousands of Eastern Europeans and even Portuguese people to come to the UK and take mostly low-paying, low-skilled jobs (even if they actually sometimes have a good education and qualifications).

Of course they're not to blame, lots of people would move to find work if their country was poorer or struggling economically, but this high level of immigration and glut of available workers has the effect of keeping wages low, which has a disproportionate effect on the British people with lower qualifications and traditional family structures (just one working parent in an industrial city for example) who are reliant on jobs in factories, catering, hospitality and services. That explains the regional results divide in the EU referendum. Traditional areas of England specifically (which has the vast majority of EU migrants in the UK) voted to leave the EU the most. If EU immigration could be significantly reduced while being a member of the EU then I bet the overwhelming majority of people would vote to stay.

More recently, there has been a form of amnesty called 'scrapping' (*rottamazione*): someone with unpaid taxes could close their case by paying only the principal, with interest, fees and fines being forgiven.

I think Pride should show people that even though LGBT people have different sexual/romantic preferences than most, they are not different - they want people to accept it so they can live a life where being gay etc. doesn't get them treated differently, so a gay guy can live his life just like the next dude, except he has a husband instead of a wife.

As a gay guy this is what pride should be about in my opinion. I don't want to be treated differently, I just want everyone to see me as a normal person and not some weirdo because I like guys. And I don't deserve any special treatment either, I have to respect other people the same way I expect them to respect me. This is why I don't like people who dress up inappropriate and distasteful at Pride, it goes against what Pride should be. It is just making it more difficult to show homophobic people that we are not evil, just normal people so they can stop hating on us, especially in my country where being gay is not really accepted. I get that in the US being LGBT isn't a big deal anymore in most big cities, so Pride is more of a celebration of gay culture and gay people, they can do whatever they want and noone will say anything, homophobia is still a problem in my country, so things are different here.

At what rate?  Because there is a night and day difference between being deported and having your asylum rejected.  And from what i've seen most European nations have both lengthy asylum process from the outset and an even lengthier appeals process, so even if they do get rejected they aren't immediately sent back by any stretch of the imagination.


&gt; Yeah, I get that it makes you all hot and bothered, but seriously though, get a grip.

Ironic since you're the one complaining about it in the first place.  It doesn't help anyone, nor does it hurt anyone.

Tell me how your system doesn't ultimately lead to this eventuality.  Because letting in large swathes of people and spreading them out equally will only lead to more people arriving because they see how well off those you let in are doing.

Only for citizens. Asylum seekers don't get citizenship for a long while.

You cannot add hardline religious people to an area and expect it to become more open minded it just doesn't happen the UK is an example of that.

People are not static. Many refugees actually do want to return. Many want to make a life for themselves and integrate.

You are stuck in the drone incident. In case you didn't know that happened 3 years ago and the guy responsible was arrested, can you say the same about individuals such as ""ivan the terrible"" ? And stop bringing up a single incident to justify a repeated behavior by your side.

&gt;Yeah, because fans AND players are known for their civility and class?

What kind of justification is that? I already told you just because your hooligans have a history of trash behavior doesn't mean all do. Where are all of the Japanese hooligans chanting Kill all Chinamen at?

&gt;He should be removed from the match because he's bringing politics into a football match.

You speaking about politics into football is golden.

&gt;So you do admit he's provocating them as revenge?

He and others have always done the gesture after scoring. This time it was special because it was a response to provocation. Also stop avoiding the question at hand is a hand gesture worse than all the shit your side put him through?

&gt;How does Mladic trigger the Swiss? How does Vucics son trigger the Swiss? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtLsSczGG24 you do that shit too, we don't flaunt fake nationalist symbols at you.

5524,"The commission can't be removed by public vote and all but one of the 28 commissioners is selected via leaders who i have zero ability to vote for democratically.

Even if the issue i care about happens to be in the remit of the commissioner my country selected they do not represent me or my country they represent the EU, they have no obligation to answer to the officials that i elected. 

So i have pretty much zero influence over the people who hold the exclusive power to write EU legislation and decide what the parliament gets to vote on. No matter how unhappy i am with them they do not need to listen to me because they do not need my or the rest of the public's consent to stay in power. 

The parliament is a side show because they have no ability to write legislation or revoke it, at best they can slow down the commission, they give the appearance of democratic choice but they are impotent and can't vote on anything the commission doesn't allow them to.

So yes i would agree the council is democratic and the parliament (or at least would be if MPs were distributed fairly across the population instead of some people getting 10x more representation than others)

But the commission is not even close to democratic and because of the way the EU legislative process is structured they are the most powerful body in the EU who make its big decisions regarding direction and policy.

5561,"&gt;Not really, the economy can slow down which in turn makes countries loan less money otherwise their debt would get higher. It may seem infinite but at the same time the central banks are also printing money to devaluate the currency a little. More and more money goes into the system thus old debts are worth less (hence inflation)

The economy does not matter. Economy is irrelevant. The only thing it serves is this modern system driven by market forces and the ones on top of the pyramid who control these markets. It's a totalitarian system that manipulates us with corporate propaganda and institutions like school to get us to serve the interests of the system. 

&gt;It's a bit more complicated than this of course but you'll get what I mean. Climate change isn't really affected by this at all. 

Exponential economic growth has been the biggest reason behind the climate change in the first place because climate has no monetary value and thus its worthless in the eyes of the system. 

&gt;In fact the battle against climate change is funded by countries going into debt. Those giant wind parks and other clean alternatives require a huge initial investment. 

The issue is not that we don't generate enough """"green"""" energy, the issue is that our energy demand is beyond comprehension at this point. 

&gt;Changing entire industries, subsidies on electric cars. 

The issue is not that we don't have enough """"green"""" industries and electric cars, the issue is that we have huge amounts of industry and billion cars driving around already. 

&gt;Those are stimulated by a lot of governments right now to make consumers change faster.

Then they should discard this whole twisted ideology of infinite growth, and treat people as people and not ""consumers"". If every street corner and media outlet is full of corporate propaganda, it's very hard to keep a straight face when someone tells me we are having some battle against the climate change... No, we're not having any battle. We are maintaining an inherently unsustainable system with no alternatives even offered to us. 

&gt;If every country had 0 debt then they wouldn't be able to do that at all.

And they probably wouldn't have issues with the climate either when they wouldn't submit to this unsustainable and forever growing economic system. 

&gt;Sure there are probably better systems but you can't change that without fucking everything and everyone over making things like climate change goals unreachable.

Either we do something about the climate change, or then we don't. Currently we are not doing anything, and on this course, we won't be doing anything in the future either.

The PDI was in power for around 6 months before they created Mare Nostrum at the end of 2013.  Migrants knew this was an easy way to sneak into Europe, where they knew nobody would deport them afterwards.  The number of people who even attempted the journey skyrocketed.

They let the problem fester for four years, and broke EU immigration laws while they were importing migrants by not properly registering them in Italy, so the migrants could potentially sneak off to another country and the Italian goverment could make the migrants someone else’s problem.  When other neighboring counties understandily got upset about this, the Italian goverment got flippant about it, and threatened to give the migrants all Schengen visas.  Some counties even set up border checks at some border crossings to make sure the problem didn’t spill over into their countries.

The PDI did nothing to halt the migrant numbers until the end of 2017, when election time was coming back around.

lol you're talking nonsense. 

1) Austria - Hungary was not a country of ethnic Germans. German speakers didn't even make the majority in Cisleithania, let alone the whole of Austria - Hungary. It was not an ethnostate like the German Reich, but a multi ethnic empire. And Austrians were already distancing themselves from Germany at the time.

2) Germany had army, navy and all because it was bordered on two sides from two hostile powers. France was very adamant in its revanchism that they would try to get Alsace and Lorraine at one point. They just needed a pretext. Russia was also anti German, since the Tsar signed a pact with France in 1892, when, coincidentally, the Tsarina, a Danish princess, was rabidly anti German, because of the Danish Prussian wars of 1864.

5664,"More people are working as monitors this time.  Cheating on election day is hard if people work.  

As for the rumor, let's say 5 million votes were fraudulent.  How did they end up in ballot boxes and get counted?  Ballot boxes are about ~200-300 and for each ballot box there are election workers from the major parties.  They check IDs, match them to their list and open&amp;count the envelopes in the open (you can go watch).  This produces a tally sheet which they then all sign and get copies of.  From there, one copy (and the box&amp;ballots) go to the election board _and_ the parties enter the per-box results into their own system to double check.  If they all show up and work, organizing fraud that will produce huge changes is hard.  

Alternatively, say the party election workers didn't show up and any citizens who watch the count are either partisans or bullied into silence.  Then it's a simple matter fix things.  And you do get results from remote boxes where no voter screwed up (all ballots valid) and they all voted one way.  But there are ~180k ballot boxes, fixing 200-300 votes here and there will note produce huge swings.  

This year an exceptional number of people have volunteered for multiple organizations, they got trained (online and off) and I've seen claims of 90-99% coverage of all ballot boxes.  This will not prevent _all_ cheating because scrutinizing voter rolls is hard and the fear is that the official media AKP controls will prematurely announce their win to discourage volunteer election workers and make them quit early (actually the scenario can get scarier, but you can imagine how and why I wouldn't want to spread pessimism hours before the election).

Yes bro, women can be psychos too, and for a woman who wants to ruin your life, this is a very dangerous tool.

&gt;Why are you giving this as an example?

Tupac is the best example of a man punished because he didn't want to commit after getting sexual with a woman. Listen to him sometimes, he spits many truths. I honestly went in with the mindset that he was a rapist too, but aftet listening to him, how he was raised by a single mother and how he had a lot(maybe only) of female influence in his life eventually made me believe he was innocent, a thing which is now widely accepted (at least in the black community).


I don't really want to argue with you man, you have your opinions, I have mine but I want to stand by my words here. A christian man will never see this happen to him.

5708,"Alright, let's do this :)

Like other people said, this Directive doesn't change a single thing to the legal status of memes.

They are legally possible under EU law (as EU provides for exceptions for parody, quotation, etc.), but then the exceptions must be implemented at national level (as exceptions are optionals and some of them ""open"", in the sense that Member States can choose to go further than what the EU laws says). This means that some exceptions either do not exist in all Member States (parody for example) or are implemented in different ways (quotation for example).

So to the question ""what is the legal status of memes"", the technical answer is either ""it depends"" (of the way national exceptions are implemented) or ""illegal"" (where national exceptions do not cover them).

That's the technical answer and this has been the situation for almost 20 years.

In practice, apart from minor and exceptionnal cases (considering the sheer mass of memes) or when they infringe other laws or moral rights of the authors, no one went after memes. Hell, even the EU institutions use memes (or gif, or whatever) in their communication. And that's not going to change. We did and shared memes before, we're still gonna do it tomorrow under this Directive. You have plenty of things which are technically either a legal uncertainty or illegal but everyone does it anyway and nobody is blamed for it.

Like someone above said, with all the challenges the EU is facing, who can seriously believe that the EU would go after memes ? We're talking about the body that is most likely one the most protective of individual rights (including online) in the world.

Now, some say that because of Article 13, so called ""upload filters"" would ban memes in practice (which wouldn't matter anyway since Article 13 will have destroyed Internet all-together). This is of course false and nothing more than a communication/lobbying strategy (you take the absolute worst theoritical possibility and say that it's going to be the reality).

For starters the Directive (and here I'm talking about the Parliament version of the text) doesn't create an obligation to implement upload filters. We are talking about proportionate measures to be taken in cooperation with rightholders (and only for some specific types of services). And the measures must be determined while taking into account factors such as the technologies available (some might work well with one type of content but not another) or the number of works present of the service (ie the size of the service). And in any case you can't go against fundamental rights (enshrined in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, which basically has a constitutional value in EU law) or go against exceptions to copyright.

Meaning that measures can take a shitload of different forms, depending of what is most adapted given the service concerned. Youtube will have its ContentID, but smaller service will have other systems (that may very well be the exact same one as they have currently under current EU law, or even regular human review). What matters is that the service and rightholders concerned agree on it.

You'll tell me ""rightholders will force everyone to adopt ContentID"", except that it wouldn't respect the proportionality criteria, which is essential. You can't impose a system that doesn't work well or precisely enough or that would way too disruptive or costly. Basically, you can't ask of an SME the same thing than Youtube. Plus, as rightholders are not exactly happy with the de facto monopole of GAFAs, they're not going to kill the competition by asking them to do the impossible.

But, for the sake of argument, let's assume that you have a content recognition system in place. The system is meant to see if content A correspond exactly to content B that was provided by the rightholder (and for which a specific request to apply measures was made, as measures do not apply by default to any and all copyrighted content). Plus, rightholders would add other criterias to only apply the measures to content that is actually detrimental to them (for instance, they won't care if someone puts online only a part of the work, and only set the measures to apply if the entirety of the work is used) because rightholders could not care less about a meme related to their work (some sector even consider it as free advertising).

Again, for the sake of argument, let's say that you upload a meme involving a work for which the rightholder requested measures to apply and gave the platform all the necessary stuff to do so. Like other people said, the vast majority of memes involve modification of the original material, meaning that they wouldn't match exactly the work and thus would not be impacted. Plus, given that what matters for rightholders is the reuse of the complete or significant parts of a work, if you take the example of the ""One does not simply"" meme, the rightholder will not set the measures to apply to every individual still image of the film but to apply to the complete movie or very large parts of it.

Again, for the sake of argument, let's say that your meme is affected by the measures (so far you've been very unlucky I must say). As per the Directive services will have to implement mechanism to allow you to easily contest these measures (for instance on the ground of exceptions) and have the meme reinstated quickly. And should a rightholder really not be willing to have your meme online, he will have to justify it (and here they would need a blatant abuse of an exception or moral rights). And should you really be feeling strongly about it you can still go to courts (which is always possible, as per Fundamental Rights, although no one will ever do it in this case, but Greens and co insisted on having it in the text).

Is that scenario possible in theory ? Yes. Will it be the default scenario ? Hell no, this is the nightmare scenario that happens in 0.0000001&amp;#37; of cases (just like now).

Moral of the story: Rightholders could not care less about memes, memes wouldn't be affected by measures and even if they did, there are safeguards within the text. So memes are safe.

I hear the argument ""MEPs do not know Internet"", and while it's true that their experience of Internet might not be the same as yours or mine, they are not stupid people and they are advised by people who are far from being stupid or unknowledgable about Internet. You may know how to lurk Reddit, 4chan and many other useful things, but we do know lots of stuff about the Internet and how to make law.

I've been working for years on copyright and while I don't agree with many things Mrs Reda says, I'm pretty sure she'd acknowledge that we ain't stupid or corrupt (even if it's in her interest to let you think otherwise) and have a clue about what we're talking about. We just don't agree.

Furthermore, a number of MEPs are old enough and come from places (former Eastern bloc for instance) where they experienced first hand censorship and other authoritarian practices. So for them ""censorship"" isn't a catchphrase or a vague concept they throw around whenever they're unhappy, they actually know what it means and probably better than most of the people around here.",,/r/europe/comments/8t0ors/copyfacts_what_this_whole_save_the_meme_is_really/e15oges/,Faerick,1529752350

It's a bit more complicated than this of course but you'll get what I mean. Climate change isn't really affected by this at all. In fact the battle against climate change is funded by countries going into debt. Those giant wind parks and other clean alternatives require a huge initial investment. Changing entire industries, subsidies on electric cars. Those are stimulated by a lot of governments right now to make consumers change faster.

5772,"&gt; A civil nation cannot just kill people even if they are entering their borders.


It can if it's proven that this is a methodology rather then an abnormal circumstance .



This isn't a case of ""must render assistance to a lost vessel at sea"" , and that can be proven by this being a non stop repeated incident  , as well as the migrant boats having GPS (not ""lost"") , as well as the notion that these people put themselves in the path of danger intentionally , and in doing so endangering themselves as well as others .


None of the above qualifies as either ""random"" or the ""lost at sea"" argument .



Now if you're going to argue that even in the case of mass (non violent) invasion, one has the obligation to render assistance based on humanitarian ideals , I'll argue back by asking if you lock your home and car (and if so, why ?) , and also if you travel to a country that requires an entry visa , do you actually take the time to get said visa or you just go ahead and say ""fu@k them and their laws, I deserve to be there and I deserve to be taken care of by those suckers! ""  ?



See, as a former Leftist I understand the arguments perfectly , I just stopped believing that a ""White Man's Burden 2.0"" (trying to fix societies by taking them in en masse) is the solution .



It's time for something smarter, but Western Civilization (in particularly Western Europe) is still paralyzed by the so-so results of White Man's Burden 1.0  .


Example: If it was acceptable to use NATO to essentially destroy Libya (at the behest of Obama and Hillary) , it should be acceptable to use NATO to occupy a small portion of Libya and tow all migrant boats there -- at least until a better solution presents itself .


Example 2:  Sink as many migrant boats as it takes to make it clear that this is no longer a profitable endeavor .


I don't like this (option 2), I see it as barbaric , but like with children, sometime you have to be mean to get a positive results .  And if you bring out the ""inhumane"" card , I'll bring out the ""take responsibility for the open slave markets in Libya thanks to your (NATO) actions that destroyed Libya"" .",,/r/europe/comments/8t6thr/italy_turns_away_rescue_ship_with_224_migrants/e15op8s/,D-Pew,1529752871

5838,"&gt;You should realize people who prioritize migration as an issue have to make a pragmatic choice when it comes to those who oppose / promote immigration as far as policy is concerned.

There is nothing substantial about Salvini's anti-immigration policy. Screaming against migrants and refusing access to rescue boats may solve the issue in the short period, but it doesn't address the root causes of the problem nor does it create an actual solution, which instead can be achieved only through diplomacy and cooperation with Libya, with our European partners and with the African countries that are source of migration.

And by the way, just so you know, the former government had actually reached a deal with Libya's PM al-Sarraj to stop the migrant flux. After the deal was signed, migrant arrivals fell by 34 &amp;#37; in 2017 compared to the arrivals in the previous year, while in the first six months of 2018 there have been 13313 arrivals against the 60309 arrivals over the same period of 2017.

&gt;I could dislike Salvini as much as you and still support his stance on Immigration. But that takes actual nuance and a capacity for rational thought

Yeah it's easy for you to say when it isn't your country that's being mismanaged by men like Salvini. You may like his stance on immigration, even though it's a farce, but *I* have to deal with the consequences of his government's policies. I have to deal with the fact that he wants to introduce a flat tax which will reduce by 100 billion euros our government's budget while at the same time increase our spending by reducing the age of retirement. There will be cuts on healthcare, education, social security and public security.

“By its release, SRI informs about the national security warrants, requested by the law by SRI, whereas in our report, we talk about the national security warrants on one hand, the technical surveillance warrants enforced on the basis of the protocol signed by the Public Ministry and SRI, but also about the 48-hour authorisations requested by the prosecutors. This is why there is such a big difference between our report and the SRI figures. If we calculate, we can draw a conclusion about what happened with the protocol, recently declassified.

&gt;
In his recent study (The Gunpowder Age: China, Military Innovation, and the Rise of the West in World History. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2016), Tonio Andrade argues that the underlying cause of Qing military stagnation was that the empire had faced no serious military threat for decades. In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries the Qing were extremely militarily innovative and mobilized their strength to pacify the steppe, conquering Mongolia and Xinjiang and destroying the last steppe empire of the Zunghars (the quintessential and very famous study of this topic is Perdue, Peter C. China Marches West: The Qing Conquest of Central Eurasia. Cambridge: The Belknap Press, 2005). However after the early eighteenth century, as a direct result of their previous success, they had no need to continue maintaining their military standards and allowed the quality of the army to decline.


also

&gt;the White Lotus Revolt of 1796-1804 had sapped a vast amount of money, and, as the Jiaqing Emperor discovered, much of it was simply embezzled rather than being spent on the campaigns. Trouble is, Jiaqing was unwilling to take anti-corruption measures for fear of sparking a purge, and so decided that the best course of action was to give the army less money to embezzle. Less money meant less training and worse equipment.

It's very strange that you should be accusing me of sophistry since I'm the one being literal with the text. You're defending an argument whose entire idea revolves around the premise that the Romans did not fall victim to Barbarian invasions, despite literally falling victim to Barbarian invaders, because if one considers all the circumstancial excuses, we can say in some abstract sense through several degrees of removal that somehow their being physically conquered is illegitimate. You're involved in a gigantic word game, and that is emblematic of the very essence of what sophistry is.

Let us use some simple syllogistic logic here:

**P1** The Romans were conquered by Barbarians.

**P2** Being conquered by Barbarians means having fallen prey to them.

~~**C** Therefore the Romans fell prey to Barbarians.~~

**C** Therefore the Romans did not fall prey to Barbarians, because of various enthymemes and given premises that don't actually address the facticity of P1 or P2.

5944,"No. More like half my message. But still a very important one, I will explain why later. 

How do I ""\*try\*"" to depict it ? I only wrote \*that there are many instance of Muhammad telling his followers to slay unbelievers and that he was a pedophile or warlord\*. You did not understand me last time. Deciding weather Islam is evil or not first requires one to define what constitutes or does not constitutes evil, Then seeing if Islam qualifies.  You by assuming that I was calling Islam inherently evil, yourself revealed that you consider call to violence against unbelievers and being a pedophilic warlord to qualify as inherent evil. In order words if you think what I wrote was depicting Islam as inherently evil than you are the one who is making the connection between the two ideas. 

The other main point of my message, which you ignored, (didn't understand? maybe English is not your first language?) Is that it does not matter what beliefs they hold, but what beliefs the religion teaches.   What I don't find funny, is you blaming me for things I did not write. Where do you see the words  fake news in my comment? I said that your links don't prove anything.  Where did I state Muslim terrorism is the true nature of Islam? This is exactly why I separated the actions of the believers of an ideology and the ideology itself.  I can eat pork and only pray once a week and still call myself Muslim. Does that mean Islam says pray one a week? ISIS terrorists call westernized Muslims not real Muslims while those say ISIS are not real Muslims. No one has absolute authority to decide what qualifies as Muslim, or can absolutely agree what values someone has to hold to be considered Muslim but we can absolutely know what values Muhamad spread.  That is why your links don't prove anything, because It doesn't matter what those Ukrainian Christians do, what matters is, does Christianity ask them to do it? Only then can you make any judgment about Christianity 

""\*\* For each passage supposedly promoting violence in Al—Quran I could find one on the bible, for each pacifist and positive verse, I could find another.\*\*"" So please don't say what you cant back up, because I seriously doubt this. Even if you could, it is not that simple as which book has more passage of promoting violence because not all violence is the same, hitting your wife and murder are very different. The bible is in two sections old and new testaments, it is the  new testament that is most relevant to Christians while Muslims have texts beyond the Quran, such as the Hadith that are the source of their ideology. These books serve primarily as a  record for  the teachings of the founders, which just goes back to what did Muhamad and Christ teach, which is why my ""main"" point is so important. 

""\* wether Islam and Christianity are instrinsically different, my answer is no\*""

They have to be, or else they would be the same religion. How is it that Muhamad allowed sex slaves but was supposedly the next prophet after Jesus? Does allah like to change his mind or do you think this is something Christ would have allowed? What about being a warlord? If what you say was true we wouldn't have be having this conversation. There is a limit to how much of Islams bad reputation you can blame on misrepresentation, sooner or later you will have to realize it  is very different from Christianity.",,/r/europe/comments/8ryps2/the_outflow_of_refugees_from_syria_to_other/e15ixc0/,User1969-,1529739112

And your point with that being? That cherrypicked anecdotes are more important than the overall picture? Yeah, we got that your priority is feels&gt;reals. 

&gt;And yet it is still way higher than the crime rate of natives. Why should European citizens accept the import of people from demographics that are way more prone to crime than they are themselves?

Their criminality isn't inherent to their persons, it's predominantly a result of their lowly social standing. Compare apples to apples, poor immigrants to just as poor locals of the same demographics. Then you will probably still be seeing small differences, but those will start to look negligibly small compared to when you put the data for the poor young male immigrant cohort against the national average, full with 85-year-old grannies. 

The same benefit we got from letting Romania and Bulgaria join, from allowing visa-free access to Ukraine or by letting in South African tourists, all coming from much more criminal countries than WE countries.

Luxembourg for Finance (LFF) is the country's agency for the development and promotion of the financial marketplace. The banks located in the Grand Duchy specialise in private banking (wealth management for private clients), insurance, the functions of custodian bank for investment funds and fund administration, and in the distribution of shares in invetment funds. The activities of the financial marketplace are also diversifying into the fields of microfinance, philanthropy and Islamic finance. The financial sector creates one-third of the Grand Duchy's GDP.

That dual-law thing got their party shut down by the constitutional court in 1998.  They appealed to the ECHR and the this dual-law approach was found by the ECHR to be incompatible with the European Convention.  I'll excerpt from [a summary](http://associationline.org/guidebook/action/read/chapter/7/section/jurisprudence/decision/212):

&gt; 70.  ... the Court considers that Refah’s proposal that there should be a plurality of legal systems would introduce into all legal relationships a distinction between individuals grounded on religion, would categorise everyone according to his religious beliefs and would allow him rights and freedoms not as an individual but according to his allegiance to a religious movement.

&gt; The Court takes the view that such a societal model cannot be considered compatible with the Convention system, for two reasons.

&gt; Firstly, it would do away with the State’s role as the guarantor of individual rights and freedoms and the impartial organiser of the practice of the various beliefs and religions in a democratic society, since it would oblige individuals to obey, not rules laid down by the State in the exercise of its above-mentioned functions, but static rules of law imposed by the religion concerned. But the State has a positive obligation to ensure that everyone within its jurisdiction enjoys in full, and without being able to waive them, the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Airey v. Ireland,  judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, p. 14, § 25).

&gt; Secondly, such a system would undeniably infringe the principle of non-discrimination between individuals as regards their enjoyment of public freedoms, which is one of the fundamental principles of democracy. A difference in treatment between individuals in all fields of public and private law according to their religion or beliefs manifestly cannot be justified under the Convention, and more particularly Article 14 thereof, which prohibits discrimination. Such a difference in treatment cannot maintain a fair balance between, on the one hand, the claims of certain religious groups who wish to be governed by their own rules and on the other the interest of society as a whole, which must be based on peace and on tolerance between the various religions and beliefs (see, mutatis mutandis, the judgment of 23 July 1968 in the “Belgian linguistic” case, Series A no. 6, pp. 33-35, §§ 9 and 10, and Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, pp. 35-36, § 72).
