Creating a few such stations in Bosnia is fine, but the crazy density of such stations is absolutely irresponsible and can absolutely destroy some unique and fragile ecosystems. 

The reason for the irresponsible behavior is as you might imagine greed and corruption. Many of the hydroelectric stations are being built by the Kelag Group, which has been accused of having built close ties to Bakir Izetbegović, the Bosniak member of Bosnia's presidency and other oligarchs in his SDA party. They granted an absurd number of concessions to the company in exchange for some direct and indirect kickbacks from the expected electricity exports. However the net result will be that significant portions of Bosnia's natural resources will be drastically altered for a very long time. Through this utter shamelessness Bakir is going to do longer lasting harm to Bosnia than was even managed by the Turks who he admires with such slavish reverence.

51,"&gt; The point is the US induced instability in the region is what's getting the US continually involved in more conflict in the region.

Maybe, but the instability in the region at present all stems from the Arab Spring of 2011. That started in Tunisia (thousands of miles from Iraq) and had nothing to do with the US. Then Libya and Syria were just outgrowths of the Arab Spring. They started out as pro-democracy protests that had nothing to do with the US before they fell into civil war (a decade after the Iraq war).

&gt;I'm pretty sure the war against the Taliban is going on.

So if the war is still going on then we haven't lost. The Taliban haven't been defeated because they continually get supplied from Pakistan and are supported by the Pakistanis, which is why relations between Afghanistan-Pakistan and the US-Pakistan are so low. All the Taliban leadership lives in Pakistani cities. They've been hiding from the US and Afghan forces for years. 

&gt;If you want to make the world a safer place, you should really do something about Saudi Arabia, the dominant country of origin of 9/11 perpetrators and the funder and home of Salafi Islam.

Definitely. I think the current guy, MBS, is probably in the best place to do that. 


The insurgencies canibalize themselves. The exact same thing happened 3 times with the Taliban in Afghanistan, Isis in Syria, and Al Qaida in Iraq. They were so extreme that they alienated all the normal people and then they fell. 

The problem in the middle east isn't Islamist extremism. The problem is the lack of functioning institutions and democratic norms. They are dominanted by strongman politics, warlordism, and monarchies. That has been the case for the last 70 years .

The Iran Iraq was happened in the 1980s, as did the Iranian Revolution, the first Yemeni war, and numerous coups. The Middle East has been unstable for long before the US invaded Iraq


500,000 people have been killed in Syria. That is the conflict that is producing so much instability and refugees. The start of that conflict had nothing to do with the US.

The scope of their reach is quite fascinating however, especially for the early middle ages. In a much less interconnected world than the one of the Romans, it's fascinating that traders and raiders reached from Russia to the Americas and from Iceland to known contact with the muslim world.

The one thing i'd say is that i heard that the viking invasion of England might have had a bigger impact on the population of the area than the Saxon invasion. As in, genetics, place name evidence,  observed burial practices and such indicate that in northern england/the danelaw there was a significant demo-graphical shift. Meanwhile  i think that the narrative of the Saxon's coming with fire and sword and pushing the native Romano-British into the sea has been largely discredited, and i think some evidence like say forest density indicate that there might have been an increase in population following the saxon invasion rather than a decrease(indicating a more peaceful takeover, devoid of much of the slaughter).

In 1530 there were only 4060 inhabitants in the city, 30 years later this had increased to 30.000. The city was located in a place that wasn't very fertile or easy to reach over water, and that made suplying enough food for such a large amount of people difficult, since in pre-industrial times transport costs over land were prohibitive. The government even went so far as to force the peasants around the city to grow wheat (instead of the much more profitable vegetables) so the people in Madrid could eat bread. The price of food was high in the whole region for centuries after it became the de facto capital of Spain.

Actually yes and no. Turkic people/tribes are people speaking a collection of ethno-linguistic groups of Central, Eastern, Northern and Western Asia as well as parts of Europe and North Africa and Anatolian Turks, which actually sounds more like ""Turanian peoples"" if you add Tungus, Mongols, Finns, Hungarians (like you did before), Estonians, Koreans. You can compare it to Semitic peoples which is a similar term for an ethnic, cultural or racial group who speak or spoke the Semitic languages, like the Akkadians, Arabs, Hebrews (Israel), Canaanites, some Ethiopians, etc..   
    
Your definitions actually fall somewhere in between Pan-Turkism and Turanism, rather than Turkey's Kemalist Nationalism which displaced both. Most people in Turkey aren't like that today, although some have such tendencies while others are more pan-ottomanist or pan-islamist and others Kemalist who are western oriented and secular. Then there are Kurds also.    
     
And while still part of Turkic family, an admixture analysis determined that the Anatolian Turks share most of their genetic ancestry with non-Turkic populations in the region (European, Eastern Mediterranean, Anatolian, Middleeastern etc), [and the 12th century is set as an admixture date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_studies_on_Turkish_people).

167,"I participated in the Velvet Revolution in 1989 that happened in Czechoslovakia. I already attended demonstrations in 1988. I was chased by police with my GF during the anti-communist demonstration that happened on an Independence Day (10-28-1988). The last year of the communist regime witnessed a significant weakening of the communist power, and communists were getting nervous as less people took them seriously. We had a meeting at our company in the fall of 1989 when a commie attempted to brainwash the working masses, and people laughed. My boss, who was anti-communist, told him that he should watch carefully what is happening in Hungary and East Germany, because the communist power will be swept away. People were cheering and made jokes at the expense of the communist regime. Later that week, I watched my boss getting arrested, pushed into a black car and driven away from our workshop. The old guards wanted to preserve a power at every cost, while even the younger commies did not care about it anymore. 

The events in Prague caught several of my colleagues who were beaten up by the police. They reported the incident on Monday, which caused people to protest. We had a small hand press in our workshop that we used to print anti-communist materials within the first week of the Revolution. Our factory was one point surrounded by armed communist militia, which was made by aged, primitive, and drunk men playing tough guys in camouflage with guns. The local, morbidly obese chief of the communist party was spooked of the possible confrontation, so he sent them away from our factory.  Generally, during the Revolution, people made a lot of demands, we tore down red star that was shining there, and insisted on resignation of various people. 

The events happened really quickly. I enjoyed watching communists losing their power. Many hoped that the USSR would use its army to preserve the order, but it was not happening. Some people changed their political coat very quickly. I knew one b..ch that cried during the Brezhnev's funeral and during the Revolution, she was sitting with the anti-communist opposition in our town hall. I was thinking, damn such a staunch commie couple years earlier now demands democracy. The best change happened when borders were opened, the press was liberated, and communist supremacy ended. I had the chance to travel to the West and back in the 70s and 80s, so I know how painful was it to obtain a travel permit under communist regime; and suddenly, we were free to leave.

The biggest mistake is, that the crimes of the communist ideology and leftist red-terror were not punished. Unlike the end of the WWII was followed by the Nuremberg tribunal, the communist regime lacked such public condemnation followed by well-deserved execution of high-ranked communists who were responsible for creating one of the bloodiest regimes in the history of Europe. Communist regimes deserved the same treatment as did National socialism in Germany, where the lack of the de-bolshevization poisoned the social, political, cultural, and economic development of the former Eastern block. The elites there got idea, that their crimes will go unpunished. Communist mentality is still deeply rooted in the society, and there are still apologists, who see nothing wrong with the system. Also people did not bring any sacrifices for their freedom; therefore, the democracy in Czechoslovakia arrived undeserved and unappreciated.

190,"Bernie ""I took my honeymoon in Russia in the height of the Cold War, when Russia was 1000 times the threat it is today"" Sanders?  That guy? [**Sure**](http://www.thedailybeast.com/when-bernie-sanders-thought-castro-and-the-sandinistas-could-teach-america-a-lesson):

&gt;In the 1980s, any Bernie Sanders event or interview inevitably wended toward a denunciation of Washington's Central America policy, typically punctuated with a full-throated defense of the dictatorship in Nicaragua. As one sympathetic biographer wrote in 1991, Sanders ""*probably has done more than any other elected politician in the country to actively support the Sandinistas and their revolution.*"" Reflecting on a Potemkin tour of revolutionary Nicaragua he took in 1985, Sanders marveled that he was, ""*believe it or not, the highest ranking American official*"" to attend a parade celebrating the Sandinista seizure of power.

&gt;It's quite easy to believe, actually, when one wonders what elected American official would knowingly join a group of largely unelected officials of various ""*fraternal*"" Soviet dictatorships while, just a few feet away, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega bellows into a microphone that the United States is governed by a criminal band of terrorists.

&gt;None of this bothered Sanders, though, because he largely shared Ortega's worldview. While opposition to Reagan's policy in Central America-including indefensible decisions like the mining of Managua harbor-was common amongst mainstream Democrats, it was rare to find outright support for the Soviet-funded, Cuban-trained Sandinistas. Indeed, Congress's vote to cut off administration funding of the anti-Sandinista Contra guerrillas precipitated the Iran-Contra scandal.

&gt;But despite its aversion to elections, brutal suppression of dissent, hideous mistreatment of indigenous Nicaraguans, and rejection of basic democratic norms, Sanders thought Managua's Marxist-Leninist clique had much to teach Burlington: ""*Vermont could set an example to the rest of the nation similar to the type of example Nicaragua is setting for the rest of Latin America.*""


I'm tired of carrying NATO on our backs to be quite honest. There is absolutely no reason why the Nations of the EU cannot meet their 2% GDP goals in NATO except they don't feel the need to. Meanwhile we're contributing 3.5%-4.0% to make up for their lack of commitment. World War II ended slightly under 73 years ago. At the time is made sense for us to remain spread across the EU nations to protect them while they rebuilt and recovered. We've been there long enough. It's time that the EU nations actually stand on their own two feet.

Bring our troops home. Close most of our bases across the EU. Reduce our NATO contributions to 2% until every single member of the NATO alliance meets that same 2% threshold. Germany is a security free-rider that exploits American generosity to run a massive trade surplus.  For a country flush with cash and a large budget surplus, it should be able to spend 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense.


There is absolutely no reason the US has to care for the security of Europe. It's time to pull out and that's what American voters want. We should shut down NATO and let the Europeans create their own version without the US. That would be ideal and people have been saying this for decades.

Damn.  I thought at first that this was a class-action lawsuit with 1,600 members, but looks like the UK doesn't have class-actions.  We're talking about VW having to deal with an actual 1,600 investor lawsuits.

And when I was looking for information on UK class-action lawsuits, I got this:

https://www.emmlegal.com/news/class-actions/

&gt;Why don’t we have class actions in the United Kingdom?
&gt;
&gt;Class actions are not permitted in the United Kingdom per se although we do have collective forms of litigation available such as “Group Litigation Orders”.
&gt;
&gt;A Group Litigation Order (“GLO”) is an order under Civil Procedure Rule (CPR) 19.11 to provide for the case management of claims which give rise to common or related issues of fact or law (the “GLO issues”)[5].
&gt;
&gt;A GLO allows individuals who have claims (whether issued or not) giving rise to common or related issues of fact or law, to join forces. This has many advantages such as splitting the costs between the group litigants, increasing the availability of similar evidence and the sharing of knowledge and litigation risk. It is important to note that parties do not have an absolute right to proceed under a GLO and the Court must grant permission to the Applicants to litigate in this manner.  Under CPR 19.11, the Court may make a GLO where there are, or are likely to be, a number of claims giving rise to the GLO issues.
&gt;
&gt;An application for a GLO may be made at any time before or after any relevant claims have been issued and may be made either by a claimant or a defendant[6]. If a successful application is made to the court in accordance with CPR Part 23, the Court can manage all claims covered by the order in a coordinated way. Under CPR 19.11, a GLO will establish a group register in which the relevant claims will be entered, specify the GLO issues that will identify the claims to be managed as a group, and specify which court will manage those claims[7]. All judgments, orders and directions of the court will be binding on all claims within the GLO unless ordered otherwise[8].
&gt;
&gt;**Most recently in the United Kingdom, the VW Emissions Action Group, made up of many thousands of motorists affected by the Volkswagen emissions scandal, has filed an application with the High Court for a GLO order against car manufacturers Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda and SEAT. It is alleged that the manufacturers deceived customers as to the “green nature” of the cars in question by installing devices which duped emissions tests. Volkswagen have already had to pay US14.1 billion towards settlement in relation to a class action brought in the United States.**
&gt;
&gt;If UK litigators wish to conduct GLO litigation, there is no straightforward process for finding others who may have claims which give rise to common or related issues of fact or law. Further, Claimants in the UK, must “opt in”- i.e. agree to be party to the litigation and make an application to be included. This is in stark contrast to class actions in the US whereby those falling under the definition of the “class” are presumed to be included in the proceedings and must “opt out” if they do not want to be bound by the rulings of the court.

False.

&gt; The International Criminal Court (ICC) has authorised an investigation into possible war crimes perpetrated during a conflict between Russia and Georgia.

&gt; The investigation relates to the conflict in 2008 centred on South Ossetia, a breakaway region of Georgia.

&gt; The ICC says it has ""a reasonable basis to believe"" that crimes against humanity and war crimes were committed.

&gt; More than 6,000 alleged victims made representations to the court in December 2015.

&gt; In October 2015, ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda announced she had evidence suggesting both sides had killed peacekeepers, which is a war crime.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35422437 (January, 2016)

Every other crumb of ICC-attacking, Bolton-defending barf you're excreting here is a total fucking lie.

&gt; You can complain about US officials all you want.

And.. the ICC is going to open an investigation into your war crimes.

It's an interesting argument, but you realise that the decade after we joined was pretty shit in economic terms for most of the UK, unemployment shot up massively over the next decade peaking at over 12% in 1985, interest rates topped 18% in 1980 after a fairly solid rise, and then remained relatively high until the early 90's, inflation jumped to 24% in 1975, and stayed high until the mid 80's too. 

That said, that isn't all due to EU membership, it largely comes down to both international and domestic issues.  But the idea that the UK was in a prolonged shit state and then everything was lovely once it joined the EU is utterly false.

No, Gaddafi did.

&gt; The ICC is where exactly in that steaming pile of shit? 

Nowhere, because the intervention was multilateral, and in response to an impending democide in Benghazi. Therefore, under R2P, the international community is entitled to violate Libya's sovereignty.

&gt; There is a reason the US invades assholes on the other side of the world.

Yeah, in the case of Iraq, according to Rumsfeld's own words to Richard Clarke, because Iraq had some good targets to bomb.

&gt; After the president returned to the White House on Sept. 11, he and his top advisers, including Clarke, began holding meetings about how to respond and retaliate. As Clarke writes in his book, he expected the administration to focus its military response on Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. He says he was surprised that the talk quickly turned to Iraq.

&gt; ""Rumsfeld was saying that we needed to bomb Iraq,"" Clarke said to Stahl. ""And we all said ... no, no. Al-Qaeda is in Afghanistan. We need to bomb Afghanistan. And Rumsfeld said there aren't any good targets in Afghanistan. And there are lots of good targets in Iraq. I said, 'Well, there are lots of good targets in lots of places, but Iraq had nothing to do with it.

Are you kidding me? In Germany from 2009 to 2016 Youtube was pretty useless because Youtube could not come to an agreement with the German media licensing organization GEMA - leading to many videos that contained copyrighted music to be just straight-up not playable. (Got a nice black screen with a few lines of text instead, apologizing for the inconvenience and saying that it's all the GEMAs fault.) We just got rid of this 2 years ago, I don't want to see it coming back in a different form.

&gt;Reddit is on the lawless side

That sounds a bit harsh. In most cases link-posts link to the original source, generating completely normal traffic for the original content creator. Rarely do link-posts link to archived articles, or are presented as text posts with the importan snippet beeing quoted + a link in text form beeing added as a source.

&gt;because it benefits from it

EU public discourse also benefits from it, without it fact checking and pointing out flawed logic would be impossible. The rise of political parties with extreme viewpoints where I live is already bad enough, those parties benefit immensely from fake news, unresolved controversies, and people generally speaking being just uninformed. Placing more barriers in the way would not help at all, instead it would make everything even worse.

&gt;not because this law is bad, quite the opposite

The laws use very broad terms, leaving lots of room for courts to interpret the laws in favor of media organizations.

Also Germany and a few other EU countries already have similar laws, and no media organization makes use of it. Why?

Voting systems have their advantages and disadvantages. FPTP can work very well when you have a stable society dominated by two large blocks. But the system does not work well in times of change, because it doesn't allow smaller parties. It just creates a lot of frustration and mistrust in democracy, because its simply less democratic.

Of course, getting rid of the FPTP plague is fucking hard. Once in place, the large parties favored by it of course won't give it up.

The GDPR is a good thing, but no-one is vetting companies to see if they carry out data processing in a reasonable manner. Enforcement is reactive, that is to say, there have to be valid complaints before any action is taken.

416,"&gt; Demographically? Turks are largely of native Anatolian stock, descendants of some of the most ancient Indo-European civilizations.

Turks are descendants of various peoples, not only the people who lived prior to Anatolia, but of Turkic people as far as Siberia. Turks have considerable Turkic admixture, because after all Turks are a Turkic people.

&gt;Their culture is markedly Eastern Mediterranean, like Cyprus or Lebanon, even islander Greek, definitely not Turkic funnily enough.

Turkic people were largely a semi-nomadic people, and nomadic groups usually assimilate and adopted the cultures of their neighbors once they have established themselves into a region. Many of the Turkic groups in Eastern Europe are pretty indistinguishable from Russians for examples (say Chuvash). Another similar parallel would be the Magyars, who now are very close to their neighbors despite their origins.

438,"You have control of your decisions yes but you don't have control over what emotions that arise within us. If you are higher in testosterone you will be presented with less fear and aversion when facing risk. 

How do you determine what a baseline level of risk-aversion is acceptable for society generally? Its all well and good to say that jumping off a cliff, for an extreme example, is something everyone should be averse towards but what about more difficult &amp; everyday scenarios? What about deciding to go mountain biking or not? What about confronting someone who is mistreating your loved ones? What about deciding what to eat? 
 
You can say that careful calculation and rationality should guide everything but in practice that simply doesn't work. 

First of all there are too many risks for this to be feasible - every moment carries with it infinite decision with infinite variability in risk.  

Secondly, it actually takes quite a bit of practice via mindful meditation to teach yourself to notice emotions as they arise and reduce the time horizon for conscious thought about the emotion. As I understand it the cortex (ration, logic, consciousness) is mostly a servant to the id (natural emotions , desires, etc.). I've seen many references to research on this from many people but admittedly haven't read much on it myself. But it absolutely makes sense - when you think about it, how could it be any other way? Our super-powered cortex is what sets us apart from other animals but the mechanisms that generate emotion and stimulus are primitive and universal. So from an evolutionary perspective it makes absolute sense that emotions are fundamental &amp; faster-triggering than the cortex which is a more recent therefore more superficial development.

I think a lot of the fear and anger around this topic comes from uncertainty surrounding why this expropriation is acceptable. I've seen two main justifications: First, that it's necessary to return land stolen under apartheid. And second, that it's unacceptable for 10% of a country's population to own 70% of the land.

The first justification I think is valid. But the second is what's scaring people. Based on current demographic trends, white people will make up 10-20% of the population within a few generations in many European countries (England, Sweden, France, maybe a few more). And likely, due to generational wealth, will continue to own 70+% of the land in these places. In 100 years time, would it be acceptable for the UK government to expropriate land owned by white people for redistribution without compensation? Even if it's an estate where a family has lived for 1000 years rather than a farm stolen during apartheid?

&gt; 
&gt; 

Except it isn't. 

&gt; Article 98 of the Rome Statute prohibits the ICC from requesting assistance or the surrender of a person to the ICC if to do so would require the state to ""act inconsistently"" with its obligations under international law or international agreements unless the state or the third-party state waives the immunity or grants cooperation.[34] The U.S. has interpreted this article to mean that its citizens cannot be transferred to the ICC by any state that has signed a bilateral agreement with the U.S. prohibiting such a transfer, even if the state is a member of the Rome Statute. The U.S. actively pressured states to conclude such so-called Article 98 agreements, otherwise known as bilateral immunity agreements (BIAs). The Bush Administration claimed that the BIAs were drafted out of concern that existing agreements—particularly the status of forces agreements or status of mission agreements (SOFAs or SOMAs)—did not sufficiently protect Americans from the jurisdiction of the ICC.

-----

&gt; And unlike the ICC, who has already tried, convicted and sentenced war criminals, you'll be treated as a deluded nut and depending on your persistence and fanaticism, committed for psychiatric treatment.

Just not American ones, which is what we're talking about.

&gt; Because you owe loyalty to your country.

Don't make me laugh. Even if I did, I would be sure to define such loyalty myself, you would be the last person to have a say on that.

&gt; You'll be subject to our court of law, specifically:

I'm missing the part where it incriminates disagreeing with /u/tarekmasar or any other lunatic

&gt; And so on, and so forth in further articles up to and including article 107, which covers everything from serving in a foreign military's ranks to assisting it in any way during hostilities. Or even so much as disadvantages the state during such hostilities.

I thought we agreed on there's no data on individual rapists' sexual preferences so there's no way you can tell if the number of regular migrants decreases the chance at all. The data is incomplete on a matter as complex as human relations because there's no way to map it for each individual, and predictions are inaccurate by nature.

&gt;Basically you can give a relevent number or misrepresent what the data means?

What the data means is whatever you want it to mean.

&gt;No, it's just that there aren't villages of two people. Your reality doesn't work with stats. The real world of countries and populations does.

Good, it should be the other way around right? That stats should fit reality and not the other way around. My example was extreme, to show how an inaccurate set of data can provide no relevant statistics. The larger the sample size and the more complex the matter statistics goes increasingly inaccurate. People aren't birds, you can't map their individual behaviours by tracking just one of them and assume the rest of its flock will behave the same way. You can't take a sample size of 10 thousand and assume it works on 10 million.

I still say statistics don't work on people. It works when you want to map how many more products your factory made after hiring 10 people.

The practice of murdering without due process is a violation of international humanitarian law, human rights, and the 5th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The ""justification"" is simply declaring the crime scene to be a temporary war theater, which can appear, disappear and expand anywhere.

693,"I certainly did. Let's take a closer look.

Up first is the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers. They tell us that it's an original neighbouring right that is separate from author's rights. All true, but none of that means that there has been any change in the ""threshold of originality"".

In fact, if you read the legal analysis [linked to in your quote](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=223034c8-e9ff-4f2e-b4ac-6f6cb04e2f01&amp;utm_source=Lexology+Daily+Newsfeed&amp;utm_medium=HTML+email+-+Body+-+General+section&amp;utm_campaign=Lexology+subscriber+daily+feed&amp;utm_content=Lexology+Daily+Newsfeed+2016-10-13&amp;utm_term=) you would see this:

&gt;The press publisher’s right would be subject to the statutory copyright exceptions (which are comparable to the U.S. doctrine of fair use), including an exception of quotation for purposes such as criticism or review, private use, use by non-profit educational organisations, etc.

And later this:

&gt;As regards the protection of a full press article or major parts thereof against unauthorized display on other websites and apps, such a related right is not necessary because the publisher can prevent their digital use based on the exclusive exploitation rights that the authors of the articles usually grant to the press publishers.

But wait...what is this?

&gt;While, for example, the current German Copyright Act (where a comparable related right of press publishers was introduced with effect of 1 August 2013, see Sec.87f German Copyright Act) permits the digital use of individual words or small text clips without the press publisher’s consent, the new Copyright Directive proposal does not provide for any such exceptions to the right. Would, therefore, a common search engine result or a news teaser in a social media account using the articles headline “TV-Duell: Trump vs Clinton – winners everywhere?” be a digital use requiring the press publisher’s consent? And could permitting the search engine to crawl over and index the website of the press publication be considered an implied consent of the press publisher to a display a part of its press publication in the search results?

Somebody actually justifying themselves! Put this one in your file. Unfortunately this is an academic distinction between whether such usage would fall under the headline author's rights, or the publisher's rights, or both. (And an exception has in any case been added since this analysis was written.)

Next up in your earlier comment were two pieces written four and six months before the proposal was made. You were wise not to refer back to these.

After that we see some politicians and lobbying groups. Zero justifications provided. Skip!

Then we come to the big ticket. Newspapers have indeed widely reported repeated opposition claims without questioning them, which I think is a tragedy. Some of them do get it right - [see the boxout here on The Register](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/07/05/eu_copyright_vote/) \- but I suspect that many consider the distinction too fussy, if they understand it at all. Some confuse these proposals with the earlier German laws. Others that you quoted are reporting whatever claim was made without endorsing it themselves.

It isn't as one-sided as you think, though. Academics do much better than journalists, with [even those fiercely critical of the proposal refrain from repeating false claims about what it does.](https://www.create.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/OpenLetter_EU_Copyright_Reform_24_02_2017.pdf) And of course [the European Commission is also accurate](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/faq/frequently-asked-questions-copyright-reform) (see answers 7, 8, and 9).

And then there was the GDR time, which didn't help that. While Western Germany modernized, and built up one of the biggest economies worldwide, Eastern Germany was kind of stagnant. 
After the reunification, many people (especially the young, and ex-westerners) moved from East to West, making it even harder for the East to catch up with the rest of Germany. 


Berlin almost wouldn't be the capital of Germany btw. After the reunification, there was a vote in the parliament if either Bonn should stay the capital, or if Berlin should be the new capital for Germany. It concluded with 51,5% for Berlin, and 48,5% for Bonn.

That's misinformation. It's almost as bad as our chief of intelligence calling a video fake because he couldn't prove the video was taken at the time and location it claimed.

No. Food bought and prepared in bulk in a restaurant or cantina is generally cheaper.

969,"&gt; Except you also have that extra 10 thousand migrants in the country so the citizens of the country are no more likely to be raped. 

And that makes it okay because...?

&gt; . If an Afghani crime ring comes in and moves the local crime ring to a different part of the country, then crime overall crime is still up ...  
&gt;  
&gt; If the crime rate of the immigrants is the same or lower than the local population then the local citizens are no more likely to be affected by crime 

These two contradict. And you assume migrants who commit crime are proportionately more likely to attack other migrants than locals after settling. This based on what? That statistics don't distinguish between the groups?

Statistics don't mean anything when the data they work from don't provide adequate accuracy. Like crime rates don't increase in heavily populated migrant areas can mean they didn't get more reports than before (does anybody check if migrant v migrant crimes are properly reported?). And it disregards a lot of factors, like what was the predicted value (so a police dept. restructuring can impact crime rate by -2% but then it turns out to be -1% so everything's fine because it's still decreasing?). There's no way to check, no ""what-ifs"", that's why statistics is meaningless on this area. It serves to comform people into whatever beliefs they had before reading them. Statistics belong to production and sales where all data is as accurate as you want them to be and there're no guessing around, rounding up, and input inconsistencies.

Every act of crime committed is a terrible thing and while a 0.01 difference is within statistical error margins it will mean lives lost. At this point, who the fuck cares about economic benefits? If you got the choice of ""do I want 10 rapists in my country to increase my pension by 1%?"" who says yes? You just do a leap and hope it's going to be a girl you don't know?

Over Barcelona, the article misses the [Eagle](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%80liga_de_Barcelona); *trabucaires* which are really noisy dance groups firing [blunderbusses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunderbuss); and the [ball de bastons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_de_bastons).

The giants thing, there're only so many over Catalonia, it's not proper of all the territory. There's a museum in some place in Belgium which gathers all the info on giants in Europe. IIRC, Belgium itself is the only other place with this tradition being rather widespread, with other places having giants in a more anecdotary level.

I haven't been to Barcelona's 'fire runs', don't know if they actually ""run"", but if you actually want to get in or close you may need proper clothing and protection for your face specially (a straw hat and some bandana for your face should do the trick). Your clothes will get holes tho, so don't get close with anything that you appreciate or is expensive.

I really suggest you to get close to any human tower happening, as while they're very impressive from afar but it's a completely different view from the bottom of them (but don't get too close or they may hire you to participate in the base). There're 2 official competitions in Plaça Sant Jaume (a square in the old city core, near to ""La Rambla"", which holds both the City Hall and the Palace of the Generalitat —so the mayor and the President of Catalonia are present). The first happens in the 23th at 12:00 and invites foreign top-tier groups: Vella dels Xiquets de Valls and Minyons de Terrasssa. These two do 8.5/10 level castles. But the square will also be really crowded that day, and you may not be able to appreciate what means 1 extra level in a castle without the help of someone who is both a local and a fan of castles, so you may as well go the next day, in which 5 local groups act with a lower level (6/10 median difficulty, I'd say). Anyway, those two showings start at 12:00 or so and tend to have a duration of 2:30-3 hours, but human towers also happen during those parades.

Tarragona's festivites coincide in time too, and they're way higher in number and quality of folklore dances.",Catalan Republic,/r/europe/comments/9eku0a/did_you_know_about_la_merce_celebrations_in/e5pprpj/,Erratic85,1536569917

yes and no, sure, you can't know for 100%, but as several leading economist, such as Hans-Werner Sinn suggested in \~2015, exiting the euro would lead to a currency depreciation, which would definitely helped out Greece hugely.

That said, i still think it could have been worse for the EU zone overall, since it could have been considered a failure from the outside, but in the discussion we were talking about Greece alone and there it is pretty fair to say, that they would have been definitely been better of without the euro.

1085,"You're being downvoted way too much for a sincere question.

That said I would like to stress, like others that you're confusing proportional vs FPTP with parliamentary vs presidential.

In particular the weakness of FPTP (where the simple plurality of votes wins without even a second round) stands in the spoiler effect, over time it'll evolve into a locked two party system (Counting congress+senate+states legislature there are less than 100 independents or third party members holding elected office in the US). This is even more evident in the US because while a congressman is local you also elect the president, a party that doesn't have a chance to win the presidency is essentially uninfluential and people will not risk wasting their votes on them even at the state level. In the parliamentary UK the effects of FPTP still are highlighted by a low number of third parties, but not having a set in stone win condition (the PM is not elected) allows regional or centrist parties to develop

&gt;This probably boils down to the framers not foreseeing:  
&gt;  
&gt;\+ The rise of political parties  
&gt;  
&gt;\+  Voting rights being extended beyond the wealthy/educated landowners, you can also see that in the approach to free speech as ""marketplace of ideas"" and the consequences they expected. But that's another story

This spoiler effect coupled with the singular role of the presidential election means you will vote for your party most of the times without even looking at the candidate. If a loony candidate gets the nomination from the party what will you do? Vote for the other guy? No, of course not. Vote for a disgruntled party member challenging him? No, that would risk splitting the vote too much

And that reasoning, applied to the whole nation got you a president that only 45% of **Republican primary voters** though was the best option. Now, Trump is not a neonazi, but if the US were a parliamentary system with proportional voting the republicans would've probably split, as would've the democrats. A looney candidate would've had to enjoy the support of only those truly dedicated to him, the actual number would be seen and this all would've been in the light and subject to everyone's vote. Not only a portion of party members. Trump would never have gone from the TV to the White house, at the very least he would've had to spend a term in the senate or in the House where everyone could see the hard facts of what kind of policymaker he was.

And can you please explain what kind of oversight of the Executive is possible in the US but not in parliamentary systems?

TlDr:

In a proportional system the loony discontent assholes go from go from 4% of representatives to the actual number. In a proportional parliamentary system when they reach a substantial number they might get to decide who will lead the government

In a presidential system with FPTP the assholes will grow inside the party without much public oversight until the moment they break through the resistance of the party structure and they cash in big time.

1093,"&gt; This is usually the general idea of most right parties in EU

Sadly. The problem is both interpretations are right. We have to accept asylum seekers coming from wartorn areas, but we don't have to accept people coming from stable but poor regions who are only interested in German/Swedish welfare programs. In politics though, it's only one of the two: right wings say everyone's a welfare leech and lefts say everyone's a refugee. 

Orbán (Hungary) has been caught off guard though, he won a campaign largely aided by his agressive stance on the crisis, but Hungary is still accepting refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and other unstable states. When he was asked the question ""but you said we keep out everyone"" he said ""asylum seekers aren't migrants"". He's against forced distributing welfare leeches AND asylum seekers alike because he wants to keep the right of filtering in his own hands (he fears Germany will select out the law-abiding and the educated and will send the human trash to Hungary).

So he's basically talking about rejecting everyone for gaining popularity but he still abides international laws. Sadly this isn't what you read in western newspapers and he isn't even correcting people because the image he gains by playing the villain grants him a huge popularity boost all across Europe. And he's at least partly right though: there needs to be a distinction between asylum and welfare seekers, they need to be filtered out and returned to wherever they came from but it should be done plainly and transparently and without the media circus surrounding it.

Congratulations - you're the exception, not the norm.

However, that doesn't mean every single man is dominant on every single woman, while men do also get short hand of the stick, individuals are under the pressure of the system and many women do also profit from the patriarchal system. Especially when it comes to the contemporary West and the middle class urban females, that's a thing we all observe as they can be pretty eclectic and cherry pick stuff, and of course rural women do also use the structures and norms of the patriarchy when it suits them. It's not about the capitalism, but the social system and gender roles themselves. There is also no such a thing as the self inflicted negative effects. Not every male or males in general do come up with the current system, nor it's something that individuals rule. Females being less advantageous as the gender doesn't mean males are enjoying stuff, males are creating the system themselves in the first place or if the male individuals aren't suffering since the current system but secretly the whole men do profit with an evil laughter.

Istanbul pogroms were terrible, but it was something done by a politician to get elected by increasing religious tensions and shift blame during an economic crisis. Unfortunately then and now Turkey is still very nationalist and these crimes weren't given its proper punishment. Nationalists are unreasonable creatures and they try to justify it as well.

1233,"If it's not done at the EU level, any member has a strong incentive to ""defect"" -- to become the loophole to get money into the EU system and take a cut.

If you want to effectively block money laundering into the EU and avoid having one rule for everyone, then you'd have to have checks at the ""border"" of any EU country that might have weaker laws into the others, and pay for all the overhead of that internal barrier.

Any policy that is based on preventing X from entering the EU and where checks necessary to block it happen only at the exterior of the EU really has to have one set of rules.

Examples of trying to have separate enforcement/rules on things where ""once you're in the EU, you're in"" not working:

* Schengen Area.  In the migrant crisis, the interests of different countries in Schengen Area differed and so the Schengen exterior controls broke down, resulting in various countries raising their own interior border controls, resulting in partial suspension of Schengen uncontrolled movement.

* Customs controls: The Irish border.  We'll see how it goes, but I'd imagine that the RoI will impose controls miserly and only with prodding.  National governments still control this, not the EU.

* Profit-shifting.  Apple is going to find the lowest-tax country in the EU and is gonna book profits there via every legal means it can find, and all it needs to do is to get into *one* EU country.  The EU cannot presently gate entry of companies to the EU on this.

* Dieselgate.  I [recall that individual member states had considerable involvement in the certification process and punishment process](http://fortune.com/2018/02/06/volkswagen-vw-emissions-scandal-penalties/).

    &gt;European and, especially, German industrial, labor, and even environmental policy favored the production of diesel cars. Regulatory oversight was slight, penalties for violations were trifling, and national regulators were disinclined to handicap their home country’s carmakers vis-à-vis those of neighboring countries, whose regulators were presumed to be winking at the same gamesmanship.

    Because a company operating in any member could be ""in"" the EU and interests of different EU members were not aligned and could permit companies in one member to harm the interests of another member, the emissions regulatory system effectively broke down.  Sure, the EU can address specific problems with the system, but the point is that the underlying problems that produced the breakdown were fundamental to not having a single authority.

I'm not a fan of over-centralization, believe me.  If there's an effective way to distribute authority, I'd rather do that.  If you can break the part that must be centralized out and centralize only that, great.  But any regulatory mechanism that ""gates"" entry into the EU as a whole really, I would argue, must be enforced at an EU level to be effective.  Rules that ""gate"" entry to the EU as a whole should be made and enforced at the EU level.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9egr40/eu_seeks_new_powers_for_money_laundering_crackdown/e5piaoj/,vokegaf,1536555689

1265,"&gt; that there is even talk among diplomats about the need to rewrite major international conventions on refugee protections to make it easier for migrants to be returned to their countries of origin.

What, that the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees has serious flaws?  Discussion on that [goes back before the EU talking about it now](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0001/01RP05).  As a mechanism to permit unpopular immigration, it might work all right.  Used in the spirit in which it was intended, though, it is wildly unrealistic.  Every signatory committed to obligations that they knew they'd never honor.  One example I've given on here is ""What if there is a decades-long civil war in China, and a hundred million Chinese decide to fly to travel to *insert much-smaller country here* because it is the most-desirable place which they can fly/boat/drive to directly.  That country could never handle all the refugees, but no provision for limits is permitted by the Convention.

I think that those are legitimate issues that *should* be raised.  They are problems in a major international treaty.  You don't want countries signing treaties that they do not intend to honor.

The treaty in its 1951 form, designed to address post-World-War-II European movement that had happened and would happen within a bounded period of time as a one-off fix, was entirely reasonable; its implications were limited and understood.  The extension to the rest of the world without expansion and changes was, I think, less-reasonable.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9efe1x/eus_autumn_obstacle_course_darkness_looms_as/e5pisym/,vokegaf,1536556442

1311,"&gt;Doesnt Thaci have an arrest warrant in Serbia? Haradinaj too?

Yes, because they're wanted based on charges of war crimes. In fact, the newly established Kosovo War Crimes Court will target many Kosovo politicians as well:

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kosovo-court/kosovo-war-crimes-court-ready-for-first-indictments-chief-judge-idUSKBN1DO199

&gt;Local media and analysts speculated that some of Kosovo’s top officials who held commanding positions within the KLA could face indictments or be called as witnesses.

&gt;A 2011 report for the Council of Europe linked leading Kosovo figures – notably President Hashim Thaci – to gruesome crimes against Serbs, including trade in organs harvested from prisoners of war. Thaci has denied any wrongdoing.

...

&gt;He came and made territorial claims on a foreign country

You're being very dishonest here. Kosovo is not a recognized country by Serbia, and by many others. Claiming he's in a ""foreign country"" is something a Kosovo politician would say. Would you mind me referring to Kosovo's politicians as ""temporary leadership in charge of Serbia's southern region"", or would you consider that to be dumb? Yes, you consider Kosovo to be independent, Serbia does not. Now let's see what should we do about that. However, what you just wrote is mostly a kneejerk reaction stemming from your own personal feelings based on a clickbait title.

If Vucic got assraped with a retractable baton tomorrow, I wouldn't care a bit. He's a dick, he's a bad person, he's a psycho.

1379,"&gt; It also means there is no check on the executive branch as the legislative branch is not separate. I don't understand.

Re: checks-and-balances.  One point I'd raise is that people tend to be attached to their system...but it's really only fair to measure things empirically.  How many times have systems ""gone dictator""?

The US places a great deal of emphasis on her federal constitution and on the dangers of one branch ""going bad"" and being able to recover, having explicit ""red lines"" that would need to be crossed that the public should object to, on having independent state legislatures that can rewrite the rules and an armed public that can push back, whereas the UK is pretty much the dead opposite -- a Parliamentary majority is close to being able to act as an absolute sovereign, ""states"" have power only at the pleasure of Parliament, the public isn't (relative to the US) particularly armed, etc.

Yet...while I think that a lot of people in the US would object to the UK's political structure in 1776, maybe call that tyrannical...one does note that despite all of these safeguards that we frequently think of as essential here, there's been a notable dearth of dictators showing up in the UK...and there's been no shift back towards the monarchy running things.  Maybe other factors are more important in dodging dictators and kings than the things that we typically consider to be important.  It's not as if we *have* all that much data to work with.  Modern democracy is very young in the world; we don't have data for a thousand years spanning hundreds of countries to work with.

Maybe, I don't know, the dominant factor is in educational structure.  Or in avoiding very high levels of unemployment.  Or any of a zillion other factors.  One day, maybe several centuries down the line, I expect that our descendants will be able to draw better conclusions than we'll be able to in our lifetimes, as they'll have more data.

When the US system was built and many of its core structures were designed, one of the main sources that the Founding Fathers had to study was the way in which the Roman Republic was turned into the Roman Empire...and they had to make their design decisions accordingly.  That is a world that in many ways was very different than the one today.

Some of those decisions did not work very well.  An armed militia was *not* a replacement for peacetime armies; our lack of a substantial standing army contributed significantly to delay in our ability to respond meaningfully to Germany's declaration of war against us in World War II, and the militia has performed very poorly when moved from defense to expeditionary efforts (as into Canada against the British Empire in the War of 1812).  Privateering has not stood the test of time as a mechanism of war.  Giving Congress the exclusive power to declare war was seen as important to restrain the Executive...but in a world where nuclear arsenals take fifteen or thirty minutes to take effect, having major military action require sessions of Congress simply doesn't work -- the Executive has to be able to have power to decide and cause the bulk of populations of entire countries to be destroyed within that period of time.  George Washington thought that political parties were a terrible idea and could be avoided by people simply virtuously refusing to become involved with them...*that* certainly didn't work out.

Are checks-and-balances vital?  I have the same gut reaction that you do that they're essential.  But maybe they aren't, or maybe the ones we have are the wrong ones -- maybe, for example, the real risks today come from the power of rhetoric to produce rapid swings in public opinion, say.  Many of the moves that we see as terribly harmful today (the Reichstag Fire response, say, or what Erdogan got up to) were done in response to emergencies, where both the public and other institutions of government tend to take a light hand in limiting action.

ACKNOWLEDGES the beginning of the school year where part of the school moves with the experimental introduction of the so-called "" HNS leader Ivan Vrdoljak said that there is no ideology in the new reform package, but the focus is on children, content, education, the future and competence.

It is likely that the Croatian public has tried to convince Blaženka Divjak and her team in the process of curricular reform to marginalize the influence of the most radical members of the cleric-conservative circles such as Jasminka Buljan Culej and Diyan Vican and at the same time calm the righteous radicals who have complained to almost everything in the reform proposals, especially the choice of lectures and contents from recent Croatian history.

The crowd is praising a lot, but little he can convince

But even if we leave out the problem of HNS's political trade with HDZ, which is why we have one of the worst governments in Croatia's history, and the real level and quality of curricular reform will begin to run, it seems that Vrdoljak has few words managed to convince.

His announcement came across a fire fire on all sides, both on the left and right sides, but also on the liberal ones. The radical, clerical conservatives through their portals argued that it is a traitorous, communist project of the SDP that is going to put faith and patriotism out of school. The logical sequel to the release was also accused by the government of Andreja Plenković and the HDZ who provided all this, questioning the lack of a program that has been taught so far.

Is this a tutorial for a Croatian or a religious?

On the other hand, people of the liberal worldview have noted that many schools that have long been recognized as problematic will continue to be employed in schools this year, as they promote a very radical, often contradictory, clerical idea. It would be difficult to list and analyze such textbooks, so here we can only extract two notorious examples that are already written - the reading of the Croatian language ""Power of the Word"" and the textbook from the Religion ""With Christ in Life"".

The first material has been spoken for years. Approved in 2014, despite criticism from experts and the public, none of the previous ministers removed it from the list. What's in it controversial? Little is wrong, so some of the social networks have once again posed a completely justified question - whether it is a reading for Croatian or for religious education?

For those who do not know or have forgotten, Anita Šojat, a writer for the seventh grade elementary school, writes among other things:

""Organize in your church an evening of spiritual poetry with the teacher / teacher of Croatian language, tutor / teacher, parish priest or chaplain. Select the songs you will partake in before your parishioners. Every student must not be in charge of cunning because he can do some other work. Choose ten students who will compliment and assign each student his song. Choose and embody spiritual songs that you can play, but you can also practice and sing. If someone in a classroom from a student plays an instrument, include him in a program of performing a spiritual poem ... ''

Secondly, the following questions and tasks are asked:

""Where would Jesus take you? Compile all the places that would show / show you because you consider them important.

Invite Jesus to come to visit your family. What will he see? Write a composition of 150 words.

Select the Word of Prayer in 100 Word: Christ has no leg - just our feet to get closer to someone. Christ has no mouth - just our mouth, to tell people something. Christ does not have any help - just our help, to help the helpless. '

'' Write a review of 150 words on the subject of God's Light of Life.

Write your prayer to God in the most appropriate form (composition or song). In prayer, please turn to God in plain words. Speak your prayers in moments when you relax or when you need it. Make it your conversation.

It raises ordinary things, events and situations in which you felt / felt the presence of God. ''

Violations of Children's Rights to the UN and the Constitution

Examples could continue to run, but this is probably enough to ask the question we have mentioned above. Namely, faith should be a matter of free choice in Croatia, not institutionalized indoctrination. Children should be able to choose to be Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, atheists, agnostics or something else and should feel totally comfortable and accepted. Because of this, the college education was introduced as an elective subject. Unfortunately, it is commonly known that even this is valid only in nominal terms, on paper, because the situation is such that there are various strong pressures on children to choose catechism.

But when it comes to teaching Croatian language on every other page of the students to write compositions, songs and prayers to Christ, then there is no doubt that it is an indoctrination that contradicts the constitutional definition of Croatia as a secular state, but also the fundamental rights of a child of freedom religion as defined in Article 14 of UNICEF , which clearly states (Figure below):

""Children have the right to think and believe what they want to practice in their religion, while not preventing other people in their rights.""

Since neither the children nor their parents can choose whether they want their children to attend the Croatian language because it is obligatory, as it does not read in the book anywhere so that children can choose whether to write prayers to someone else or atheistic essays, but merely refer to Christ , there is no doubt that it is an indoctrination that is appropriate to fundamentalist theocracy, and not to contemporary secular societies that respect fundamental civilizations such as the freedom of religion.

This textbook clearly shows the side of a huge imbalance in the Croatian education system.

Atheists are non-psychic, selfish and founders of Auschwitz

A more bizarre example is a tutorial for the 8th grade of elementary school ""With Christ in Life"". As we have already written on several occasions, atheists and even modern science and technology, humanism and humanistic ethics are demonized atheist, and atheists are attributed to Nazi assault (how Hitler and Nazis were not atheists, but we wrote on the Index - look at this link ).

Recall, among other things, he writes:

'' Some people are therefore atheists because they think it is great to think of themselves as a kind of 'god' in order to determine what is good and what is bad. To whom his EGO stands in the middle of the world, that is egoist.

Egoists, this is something that everyone has ever experienced, quite unsympathetic people. The egos are logical atheists - because it is clear that no one who is bigger, more beautiful, smarter, safer or more worthy of respect than theirs is fit in their image of the world. ""

""From the experience of the newest events we know that without God and against God does not bring forth noble people, and very often those who created Oświęcim (Polish name for Auschwitz op.

""Science and technology can enhance the strengthening of practical atheism, especially if one is too interested in his knowledge and technological advancement to the extent that he forgets all ethical and moral principles. God no longer needs to begin to behave as an atheist. Success and glory of somebody make 'little deity'. God can not dwell in the heart of a brave man. Such people often dare themselves to set up moral rules of conduct in society, according to their own rather than the evangelical dimension.

Ministry: We can not do anything

Since these textbooks have been controversial for years, and as the new school year began, we asked the responsible ministry to tell us if they were withdrawn or altered in 2018.

From the answers we received, one can read that they are not, and that they think that this is not possible because the textbooks are chosen for four years:

In accordance with Article 23 of the Law on Textbooks for Primary and Secondary Schools (Official Gazette, Nos. 27/10, 55/11 and 101/13), textbooks and accompanying teaching materials are in use for at least four years in schools , counting the school year. in which they have been selected and are in primary and secondary schools in the Republic of Croatia since the school year. 2014/2015. the use of textbooks and accompanying teaching materials contained in the Catalog of Compulsory Textbooks and Related Supplements for Primary School, Grammar and Secondary Vocational School of the School Year 2014/2015. published on May 15, 2014. The catalog is valid for the new process of selecting textbooks and related supplementary teaching resources. In the current catalog there is also a textbook with CHRISTMAS IN LIFE: a textbook for the Catholic catechism of the eighth grade of elementary school, author Josip Periš and author team, the publisher of the Christian present and reading THE PURPOSE WORDS 7: Croatian reader with multidisciplinary teaching materials in the seventh grade of elementary school, author Anite Šojat, publisher of School Books. ''
",,/r/europe/comments/9eji5x/is_this_a_croatian_intermediate_school_textbook/e5pfshs/,hanotak,1536552328
1395,"
The Ministry may still drop the textbooks!

But the facts deny our ministry. Namely, according to the existing textbook Act it is possible to change or expel them from the list.

Here's what's up there:

The procedure for deleting the textbooks and supplementary teaching materials from the List is carried out by the Ministry ex officio or at the request of the publisher.

The Ministry shall, ex officio, initiate the process of deleting textbooks and supplementary teaching materials from the List:

...

- if it is not in line with the national and subject curriculum,

- if it does not comply with the Textbook Standard,

...

In other words, we can conclude that the MZO did not consider the materials mentioned so problematic to fall into the categories described above.

Only a controversial nationalist legacy has been withdrawn

The only thing that has changed is that a book was thrown out of the census list, many of which complained of directly encouraging national intolerance towards the Serbs and nurturing sympathies with the Ustashas.

'' The Little War Diary '' (My dad sleeps with angels) Stjepan Tomaša is not in the Curriculum Proposal for Croatian Language , published in February 2018. '', they said from the MZO.

What brings a new curriculum?

In the response that we have received, it is noted that the process of adopting new curricula is in progress and that the new Textbook Act will be followed in public consultation, and then a new textbook selection will be introduced. In other words, material problems should surely disappear in the next school year when all curricular reform should begin, and the textbook mandate expires.

But there are many reasons for doubts about whether this really will happen. First and foremost, it is hard to believe that people from the Church of Croats, widely known as radically righteous, will agree to make the required changes to the religious textbooks. On the contrary, the spirit of time and trends tell us that it is more likely to expect a further escalation to the right. And according to Vatican treaties MZO can not do this without church adoption.

Textbooks for the School of Life - Unknown

As far as other new textbooks are concerned, according to which curricular reform is to be carried out, they will only need to be seen, especially those in history that will talk about the problematic recent part of Croatian history only in the following years. Namely, the current history of the Lifelong School goes to the fifth grade of elementary school and the first grade of high school. They do not teach Croatian history from period II. the World War or the Homeland War. And it is well known that one of the most challenging objects, the most striking of the world's spearhead, was that history.

What will teachers choose?

In addition to this, it should be emphasized that, according to curricular reform, teachers will have even greater freedom to choose materials for teaching. It is not bad in itself. On the contrary, if you have quality teachers, you can expect quality teaching. But for years it has been known that in Croatia we have three publishers - Alf, School Book and Profil - the first of which is the most conservative and most sought after in rural environments, the latter being the most desirable and sought after in urban environments.

Various textbooks have different statements

Interestingly, this year, the most interest in experimental textbooks in the history awakened Alfa, most of all with its visually appealing content of digital objects that invested a lot of money. Since digital materials are currently an integral part of the tutorial, it seems that children in the experimental program will learn the most from the most conservative materials. As these textbooks actually look like, we will only know when they come to school and implement it for some time. Until then, we can only see something in the demo materials presented. For example, Alfin's demo textbook for the fifth grade tells what history originates from the Bible source.

It is also interesting to note that new textbooks differ in the definition of the beginning and end of the historical era in which we count time. In the three textbooks approved by the MZO students can learn different information. While the School Book and Alpha claim that the Christian era begins in the ninth year, Profile claims to start with the first one, ie that there is no age of zero (graphics above). In other words, students with different textbooks get different information.

It is also interesting to see from the publicly available digital educational content that Profiles can see that the publisher problematizes the emergence of the world and man from different religious and scientific perspectives, including evolution, whereas in those books there is no mention of evolution.

Schools without ideology - just in dreams

To conclude, in a school without ideology, which is mentioned by Vrdoljak, and which is significant in civilized European countries, we will obviously have to wait a long way. As things move, we will be happy if in schools we will not soon learn that evolution is not true, that it is ""only theory"", or that atheistic demons are to be physically eradicated! If we take into account the differences in textbooks, the freedom of teachers, the fact that many employ the political ability, the positions of Church power and political forces, and the ideological polarization in society, we can only imagine the range of ideological extremities that our children could raise and teach.

I disagree. Everyone benefits when individuals are allowed to be as productive as possible during their working prime.

But in Canada was able to start a business that made him enough money to pay for private education and health care needs of the family back home and by extension, those family members are better off and contribute more Sudan than they have without my father's support.

You just posted an article in serbo-croatian expecting to gather anti-serb sympathies, while nobody else could even read what was posted. Jesus fuck... Also, AlJazeera kinda sucks.

Anyway, here's a rough translation (trying not to change the overall style, so it may sound a bit weird):

&gt;Milosevic was a great leader with unrealistic expectations

&gt;And not because the Croats, Muslims or Albanians were stronger or braver than us, but because we did not understand Serbia's place in the world, **because we didn't realize we were not alone in this world and that we cannot live without it. Because we underestimated everyone else and because we couldn't make proper calculations. Because we always looked at and listened to ourselves, while others did not interest us. We weren't in touch with reality.**

&gt;Milosevic was a great Serb leader, his intentions were good, but his results were not. Not because he wanted them to be, but because his wishes were not set in reality, **and the interests and wants of other people were disregarded and underestimated. This is why we have paid the highest and heaviest price.**

And now look what you made me do! I actually wrote a post defending Vucic, of all scummy people! Wtf...

#Copied below:

&gt;**Migration as touchstone issue**

&gt;Brexit may be the most pressing challenge with the hardest deadlines, but many EU officials and diplomats said they expect migration to be the policy problem that tears most at the fabric of the bloc. Austria, which currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency, has set migration as the topic for the EU leaders’ summit in Salzburg on September 20. Leaders there will pick up the debate that dominated their June summit in Brussels, where through-the-night negotiations yielded a murky agreement to create new “centers” for housing and processing asylum seekers.

&gt;Little progress has been made since then, and EU nations have shown virtually no interest in taking concrete steps even to implement the June agreement. Ultimately, a consensus is needed on an overhaul of the bloc’s asylum rules. But the policy dispute is so fierce, and the gap between some national capitals so great, that there is even talk among diplomats about the need to rewrite major international conventions on refugee protections to make it easier for migrants to be returned to their countries of origin.

&gt;“Migration is here to stay,” one EU diplomat said. “Until the European elections, everything will rotate around it.”

&gt;**Brexit, never-ending Brexit**

&gt;In contrast to migration, an electric issue in nearly all national capitals, the diplomat said, “Brexit for many countries is almost a foreign policy issue. It’s on the moon.”

&gt;The U.K.’s impending departure, however, could become a critical factor if national capitals begin issuing demands in exchange for maintaining the unity Brussels views as crucial in the negotiations with London.

&gt;One concern is that countries likely to see their allocations shrink in the EU’s next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) will look to limit such losses. “The Eastern Europeans are likely to try to find a leverage to get more out of the MFF, and they could use Brexit for this purpose,” the diplomat said.

&gt;Negotiations over the U.K.’s withdrawal have been stuck on numerous points, but none more controversial than the issue of the Northern Ireland border.

&gt;Brussels has demanded a backstop provision in the formal withdrawal treaty that would effectively keep Northern Ireland inside the EU’s customs union in the absence of a broader deal to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.

&gt;The only factor more difficult is the internal politics of the U.K., where Conservative Party infighting continues. Negotiators had hoped to complete the formal withdrawal agreement before a European Council summit in October, but that seems unlikely. Some officials are predicting an extraordinary summit in November to deal with Brexit; others say a deal is unlikely to be ready before the regular leaders’ meeting in December.

&gt;The turmoil has raised anxiety over the prospect that the U.K. will crash out without a formal deal — a result that would be devastating to the EU budget because it would torpedo an agreed-upon financial settlement. A no-deal Brexit would almost certainly deliver a brutal shock to the U.K. and EU economies before advocates of eurozone reform can put their new safeguards in place — demonstrating yet again how everything is connected.

&gt;One senior EU diplomat predicted the common-sense U.K. would cave in negotiations before crashing out of the EU.

&gt;“I don’t believe in a no-deal,” the diplomat said. “It would be like that husband who chopped his testicles off as a vendetta against his wife, a little bit too much compared to their famous pragmatism.”

&gt;**Budget headache now or later? Both**

&gt;The central challenge for the EU on its next, seven-year budget plan is a debate over whether to push to complete the budget before the 2019 election — as advocated by Budget Commissioner Günther Oettinger — or after the election, which some officials say is more realistic on a practical level and more legitimate politically since it would be approved by MEPs who will be in office to oversee the spending plan, not those who are leaving.

&gt;Oettinger in a recent speech urged swift completion of the budget, warning that the EU “project is in mortal danger.”

&gt;Others, however, say that the long-term budget negotiations — traditionally the most excruciating debate among EU countries — simply cannot be completed in such a short time, especially with Brexit gobbling up so much bandwidth among senior officials (and potentially blowing a hole in the budget if national governments don’t agree to up their contributions).

&gt;Delaying the debate will not forestall the potential fight between Brussels and Italy, or other countries, over national budgets to be presented later this month, or the underlying tensions between east and west.

&gt;At an annual conference of French ambassadors last week, Jean-Yves Le Drian, the minister of Europe and foreign affairs, lashed out at the trend toward illiberal democracy and some EU governments that “don’t respect fundamental principles and don’t feel they are bound by European solidarity.” He did not mention Poland or Hungary by name but there was no mistaking where his remarks were directed. “We are not ready to pay for that Europe,” Le Drian said.

&gt;**Spitzenkandidaten, past and future**

&gt;The backdrop to all this is the upcoming 2019 European election, which is fast shaping up as a contest between pro- and anti-EU forces. Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League, has declared his desire to create a “league of leagues” that would unite Euroskeptics across the Continent.

&gt;Effectively all major EU leadership posts — with the notable exception of the Eurogroup presidency — as well as all 705 seats in the post-Brexit European Parliament, are up for grabs in 2019. The eight-year term of European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is also coming to a close, opening up another vital and prized position.

&gt;Jockeying has already begun among potential candidates for Commission president, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel throwing her support behind her countryman, Manfred Weber, the leader of the center-right European People’s Party (EPP) in the European Parliament.

&gt;The EPP and the other major political families will begin selecting their nominees in November, officially setting off a campaign season that will shadow everything Brussels does for at least six months.

&gt;McAllister, the German MEP, said he expects the election to shape up as a battle royale between believers in the EU project and Euroskeptics. “Populism will be a challenge at the European election,” he said. “The election campaign  is going to be a fight between the moderate pro-European forces of reason, on the one hand, and on the other radical right and left forces against Europe.”

&gt;The senior EU diplomat said everything would come down to migration. “It’s migration that is the crucial point. It’s migration that has shifted Europe towards the far right. It’s migration that impacts everybody.”

&gt;One thing Brussels should be able to easily handle is to deliver on the promise to end daylight savings time. But, in true European fashion, not even that is likely to take place without a great deal of squabbling.

&gt;“If we go back to one time, will it be winter time or summer time?” McAllister asked. “Will we have 12 months of winter time or 12 months of summer time? Then you’ll have a debate between the early birds and the long sleepers.”",,/r/europe/comments/9efe1x/eus_autumn_obstacle_course_darkness_looms_as/e5ofpx8/,NeoSupaZupa,1536519207

There isn't an official ballot slip inside with all the parties and candidates on it.  [Instead, there is a ballot slip for each party](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsedel) (the top image is from Sweden -- the bottom image is from Denmark).  Parties that had enough votes at the last election get their ballot slips distributed with the help of the state.  Parties that didn't have to organize it themselves.  Parties have volunteers hand out ballot slips ahead of time in streets and squares before the election.  You can also ask to have them send you a slip.  Sometimes they will just send a slip to everybody.

Once inside, you take one or more slips with you into the voting booth and fill out one of them.

People can see which slip(s) you take -- so some people take more than one or they have a hidden slip ready in their pocket that they use instead of the one(s) they take in view of everybody.

But at least they are hidden from view inside the voting booth?  Surely nobody can see what they do once they are there?

Nope.  Not necessarily.  Some of the ""booths"" are [tiny portable triangular tables with a cloth barrier on two of the sides](https://www.informationsverige.se/Svenska/Samhalle/Samhallsorientering/PublishingImages/Bild-Scanpix.jpg).

1843,"&gt;“Birds have been regarded holy and auspicial according to ancient beliefs in the Turkish culture. For example, it is believed that the doves represent loyalty and love, that pigeons are the symbols of peace and loyalty to family in the Islam faith, that the swallows protect the houses they nest in from fire, that birds nesting near a house bring abundance. There are also beliefs that breaking down birds’ nests would bring misfortune to the concerned person and infertileness to the family. It would be appropriate to consider that these beliefs are the basis of actions in the places where Turks live like allocating areas for birds and assisting them in making their nests” (Onur Erman, 2009) In this framework, some parts of the structures in the Ottoman architecture were allocated to birds, bird houses and palaces were built for their shelter and small but eye-catching bird pools were constructed. Bird houses which were constructed in an artistic and aesthetic approach were also the basis for structuring an architectural element in the Turkish culture.  The earliest examples of the bird houses were found in the 14th century and became very popular in the 18th century. Edeer’s study includes the following information: “Installing bird houses to the frontages of the buildings and decorating them with bird houses were seen in the classical Ottoman architecture of the 16th century. Until the end of the 19th century, these bird houses were improved by the skilful fingers, fine taste and masterful composition skills of the Turkish craftsmen and made the most remarkable detail of our national architecture. Usually, bird houses were built in the frontages of buildings which received much sun light and which were protected from hard and cold winds, at a safe height away from human hand or animals like cat and dogs. They were also built in styles conforming to the spirit of the building.”(Edeer,1992) Bird houses had a privileged place in the Ottoman architecture until the mids of the 19th century.  “Even there was a foundation called Gurabâhâne-i Laklakan  which was regarded as the first animal hospital to take care of the injured or migration-exhausted storks.  (Oruç 2009,p.2)

It will take some time maybe to see that things are more complicated then the first time you take a look at them.



Regarding your bet, you would loose it. I was at the protests in my town, Cluj. And no, for example when there was 'Ordonanta 13', I did not prefer to just protest and shout, I personally brought the law and we read it  at the speaker in Union Square so people know what they protest, not just shouting pointlesly.

I think you are funnily misguided, but the internet does not provoke much after thought, you just read one line don't think too much about and throw a death or life sentence about a person.

There's no reliable source on that. Only one such even occurred based on what we actually know. And it was voluntarism rather than direct orders from Moscow or whatever.

&gt;Anyone of partisans, who disobeyed the ethics - they faced the partisans' war court.

That was a shabby process and they didn't have the necessary facilities to properly execute that. Morale and order differed from one place to another but rules were hard to enforce overall.

There were also some questionable decisions made by some partisan leaders which would probably be considered war crimes and weren't disciplined afterwards. So order is a tough topic.

&gt;And the talks that they were Nazi sympathizers - are fake. It's maybe singular cases and not the ideology they were following.

2146,"&gt;It doesn't work like that though, since the economy grows and figures inflate

You called it a 'disappearance' of British manufacturing which is incorrect. Manufacturing has had modest growth since 1990, whilst the rest of the economy has grown much more. I think you should also be careful when talking about inflation, because in real terms manufacturing has still grown. 

&gt;And it kept going downhill from there. [2](https://www.productivitypuzzle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/uk-gdp-by-sector-2008100-services-construction-manufacturing-production-excluding-manufacturing-c-5729dc83f2931.png)

Your chart actually shows manufacturing growing from the 2009 point. 

&gt;simply a matter of closing up shop and the emmissions moving abroad

DEFRA have had statistics on imported emissions (where emissions from consumption are moved abroad) since 1997. As you can see [from page 11](https://eciu.net/assets/Reports/ECIU_Conscious_Decoupling.pdf) this hasn't changed significantly, and per-capita emissions are the same as 1997.  

Just to be clear, you think that because the UK's manufacturing sector is hasn't grown by much in the last few decades, that's the reason the UK has managed to decarbonise? This is wrong, especially if you look at the [emissions by sector](https://i.imgur.com/LFtjctm.png) from [this report](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/695470/Annex_1990-2016_UK_GHG_Emissions__final_figures_by_end_user_sector__by_fuel_and_uncertainties_estimates.pdf). 

France, the Netherlands, Canada and Russia also have a similar proportion of manufacturing as a percentage of their total economy. The Netherlands is one of the biggest polluters in Western Europe. This is mainly because they use a lot of coal power. The UK used to have high emissions until recently, when it priced out the coal - like you said, no fancy climate policies, they just taxed carbon to make it uneconomic to burn coal. This was separate from the flat growth in UK manufacturing.",London lass,/r/europe/comments/9eace5/germanys_failed_climate_policy_in_one_photo/e5nqaso/,Saoirse-on-Thames,1536490459

First, to disagree with the 'majory' bit pertaining to Lithuanian partisans.

Second, to state that there was a degree of individual collaboration among most of the various groups and individuals among Lithuanian partisans, sadly and most probably, were not an exclusion.  

To be clear, Lithuanian partisans as an organisation did not collaborate with Nazis and such a collaboration would have never been approved.

2174,"France:

Politics:

- **Government reshuffle: two new ministers appointed (environment &amp; sports)**.

-Following Nicolas Hulot's surprise resignation 12 days ago, Macron had to replace him. He chose François de Rugy as our new minister of the environment. 

De Rugy began his career in politics as a moderate ecologist. He joined Macron last year and was (re)elected as a MP but was then appointed as President of the National Assembly.

[I don't think I'm being biased if I say that most people are skeptical about  his ability to do better than Hulot].

-We weren't expecting it but Macron also had to appoint someone new at the Ministry of sports, because the athlete who was in charge has some judicial problems (a tax audit revealed she failed to disclose some earnings). Our new minster in a former swimmer: Roxana Maracineanu. 

[She's not very famous, contrary to the previous one. Not much else to say].

- **Macron's approval ratings are low**.

[Compulsory: I know, these polls are questionable ; I know, the French are always very severe in these kinds of polls towards their President ; I know this doesn't necessarily mean much. But I think it's somewhat interesting to point out. Macron clearly didn't have a good summer - Google ""Benalla affair"" if you haven't followed - and these figures illustrate it].

Other news:

- **3 skinheads are being judged for killing an antifa militant in 2013**.

Clément Méric died in June of 2013 after a fight with a group of skinheads. They are being judged for  deliberate assault resulting in death without premeditation and the exact circumstances appear difficult to establish. The trial isn't over.

- **The two rappers who fought in Orly airport this summer have been judged, the verdict will be revealed shortly**.

A viral video featuring Booba and Kaaris - two famous French rappers - and their respective squads made the news last month, because they all fought like complete morons inside the airport. An homophobic slur could be heard. The judge asked for 1 year suspended for both. (The press was suggesting Booba initiated the fight until now, but it seems that they were considered both responsible). 

edit: 

- **Sexual violence figures up by 23,1% compared to last year.** 

The minister of the Interior held a press conference to present the statistics of crimes and  delinquency this year. A lot of categories are decreasing but there is a surge of (reported acts of) violence against women: very likely a concrete consequence of the Me Too movement (women reporting these crimes/offences more than before). 

In more details:

27 728 reported acts of sexual violence between January and July (vs 22 533 in the first 7 months of 2017 - there had already been an increase at the time). This include reports for sexual harrassment (which appears to be the figure that increased the most. The government passed a law against catcalling/sexual harrassment in the street and in public transport and communicated a lot about this). 


 intentional assault and battery up by 7,5% (139 000 cases in January-&gt;July 2018 vs 129 000 last year). 80% of these occur in the domestic sphere and women are the main victims.

He was a native of nearby Sardis and amongst the earliest men of purely Greek origin to become a consul in the Roman Empire and is honoured both as a Greek and a Roman on the library itself.

2241,"This was common in the UK up until interest rates took a nose dive.

You borrowed the capital, paid off the interest only, and then had an endowment policy (basically an insurance policy with a guaranteed payout after its term, but with extra profit based on investment performance, like a pension).

Because interest rates are so low, endowment policies aren't profitable, and will leave you with a shortfall. Repayment mortgages are more common nowadays.

But that doesn't mean you don't *own* the house. The 'mortgagor' is only able to 'mortgage' the house on the basis of being the owner. 

If you fail to pay off the mortgage, then the lender has the option of invoking the power of sale (the most common option in the UK), or to foreclose on the property and become the owner themselves. Until the property is sold or foreclosed on, then you remain the legal owner. The lender just has an interest in the property via a legal charge.

However, that's based on English/Northern Irish law.

In part of our history people identified both macedonian and bulgarian or greek here, but the macedonian identity was always present. In fact national identity here emerged very late and very confused. People used to change between bulgarian greek or serbian alegiance. But the idea of macedonianism whether as national or regional movement was always there. The internal macedonian organisatio was formed in 1993 and its main goal was the formation of the macedonian state. The 1903 ilinden uprising goal was the creation of an indepebdebt state. 
1903 Misirkov wrote the basis of the macedonian language. 

So althought macedonian identity came on later than other balkan nations, and in fact it struggled to seperate itself from bulgarian, in the end it successfully established itself in the macedonian dtare within yugoslavia.

Now no nation apears out of nothing and the macedonian process isn't any different than the process of creating any other national identity.

Did you miss the brown coal mining remnants?

We're currently in the process of demolishing another old growth forest (Hambacher Forest) for brown coal mining. A 12.000 year old forest destroyed for 20-30 years of extracting coal from the earth to use as cheap energy. All that while much better sources of energy have been available for decades, simply because it's cheaper and will drive our GDP up a tiny bit more.

So the Soviet Union and Lenin specifically were the greatest friends of Ukrainianism *ever*.

Crimea is gone. That's it.

Room square footage, ceiling height and material quality is much better than in a great majority of contemporary buildings, let alone modernist slums that were replacing these buildings in 50-60s. I can say that because I own such old (Willhelmian) properties myself.

In fact, the state of the living conditions in late XIX century has nothing to do with architectural theory. Population explosion because of Industrial Revolution and rural flight led to the situation, where a very big amount of workers had to be housed in a short time. Hence the density. However, as early as in 1900s the conditions of (most) workers have greatly improved, as new sub-urban quarters were built to house them. This is evident when we look on such quarters as, for instance, Eilbeck and Hammerbrook in Hamburg, built specifically to house proletarians.

Of course that such buildings frequently did not have modern amenities. Hold on for a second and think in what time these were built. Modern amenities are generally a thing of a post-war era - and of course modernist developments could have benefited from such new scientific and engineering introductions. But looking at it today, we see that once refurbished and modernized, old residential buildings from late XIX-early XX century really shine, leaving any postwar modernist development in a big shade.",,/r/europe/comments/9e2b3n/restoration_of_19th_century_building_in_leipzig/e5nb2ic/,Strydwolf,1536463627

2561,"If this nonsense would have had any meaning, we could essentially dismiss Renaissance, as a movement based specifically on historicist revival. And so on, any architectural style would be discredited, as de-facto committing a mortal sin of having its roots on some tradition prior. You see what I mean? The entirety of argument that aesthetics belongs only to its era was just one of the dogmatic axioms made up by early modernists in order to somehow justify their ""break with the past"". But like every dogma its flawed - you see, you cannot forever feed people with slogans such as ""look to the future!"" or ""we build for a new era"", as time is ticking, and suddenly a hundred years have passed and the modernist aesthetic dogma stays exactly at the same spot. One hundred years of copying of exactly the same barren and sterile communist beauty ideals, while daring to say that ""don't you worry this is the future!"". Well, it's hard to say this with a straight face nowadays, while rotten concrete hulks lurk on the background.

There is function AND there is form, because form is also function. People like natural, relateable things, and this is why non-modernist architecture is overwhelmingly preferred by most people. And what reconstructions show is that it's actually possible to build in traditional manners even today. This is exactly why modernist fundamentalists such as Trüby do whatever they can to cast a shadow on it, even resorting to silly tricks such as pulling hitler card.",,/r/europe/comments/9e2b3n/restoration_of_19th_century_building_in_leipzig/e5ncozx/,Strydwolf,1536465424

2602,"1: Actually if you go by the first Olympics you could say Alexander I was identified as Greek and allowed to participate showing that they are indeed are Hellenes. Your link shows that they wished to be accepted by Southern Hellenes which doesn't disprove anything about them not being Hellenic, we also know through other sources both archaeological and from historians that show they were a Hellenic People a conclusion shared by most academia. Also as shown with historical sources they weren't recognized as Greek only after Philips attempt but were seen as Hellenes much earlier.
 
“Tell your king who sent you **how his Hellenic viceroy of Macedonia has received you hospitably…** ”
(Herodotus V, 20.4)



“These verses, when delivered to Croesus, delighted him more than ever before. He was confident that a man would always rule the Medes-never a mule-and therefore assumed that he and his descendants would rule forever.' After this, he began to investigate which Hellenes were most powerful in order to add them to his own forces as friends and supporters. By making inquiries, he discovered that the most distinguished among them were the Spartans' of Dorian ancestry and the Atheniansb of Ionian ancestry.c These were the eminent powers in antiquity as well. The Athenians, a Pelasgiandpeople, had occupied Attica· and never moved from it. The Hellenes who became Spartans, however, wandered extensively. **When Deukalion was king, these Hellenes inhabited the land of Phthia,' but under Doros son of Hellen, they dwelled in the land beneath Ossa and Olympus,which is called Histiaiotis. From there they were expelled by the Kadmeians and settled in Pindus, where they were called Macedonians. From there they migrated into Dryopis, and from Dryopis they finally came to the Peloponnese, where they came to be called Dorians.” ((Herodotus 1.56 Landmark Translation))**


“**Now that these descendants of Perdiccas are Hellenes, as they themselves say, I myself chance to know**”
(Herodotus V, 22, 1)



It's also clear as shown with the link you posted and even Alexander I that the Macedonians themselves did believe they were Hellenes and wanted acceptance from the Southern States, however there is no doubt they were viewed as a little backwashed by many ((especially southerners)) 




2:  Ok





3: There was no ""Ethnic Macedonians""/""Aegean Macedonians"" as Macedonia consisted of Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs and Albanians. The claims that they ethnically cleansed the Native Macedonians is a false one furthered by nationalists.

Do you have any suggestion on how else a country can avoid a low heat civil war from escalating into a full blown civil war? Have you seen what happens to countries when such civil wars explode?

Plus, how else do you recommend a country with a formal armed force to fight against a paramilitary organization that dresses like any other civilian and even acts and hide from among them? How else do you recommend that a country fighting terrorism avoids hitting civilians? 

Have you ever compared the number of civilian casualties from Israel's combats with similar situations involving other countries?  Try to compare it with how Russia dealt with Chechen insurgency, USA against Al Qaeda and ISIS opponents in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, etc (and these aren't even existential conflicts). 

Also, why aren't you also taking into account the Israeli civilians that were (and still are) purposefully targeted since the second intifada took place? So because Israel does a better job at protecting their own (including raising up a wall to prevent border infiltration) and therefore has a lower number of civilian casualties, it should be blamed for that too?

But, I agree soft power is useless (democracy, human rights) for Israel, its neighbours won't appreciate it for any of those. As long as there is no respect for the other side instilled in the people you can't expect anything to change. The only way Israel thrives is if its shadow is bigger then itself.

Even though the Dutch national anthem still references ""Duitsch"" as the autoglotonym which is actually often misinterpreted nowadays

Probably has something to do with why the English call it ""Dutch"".

Of course ever since WWII the Austrians aren't ""historical Germans"" even though they were one state during WWII because that was the easiest way to not feel guilty I guess.

Also the Dutch national anthem is stupid and needs to be changed; it doesn't even rhyme any more because the pronunciation changed and it's about absolutely nothing interesting and half of the words in it no longer mean what they used to and the grammar is all over the place because they updated some of it to modern Dutch but not all and there is are words in it which were already archaic when it was written but are nonexistent noun.

2916,"Well for example, the social democrats created LO, the swedish trade union confederation, ten years after they themselves were created. Other than the usual union stuff they also arranged protests and strikes for universal suffrage. In 1909 (social democrats first is in a government in 1917) in response to a lockout of 80 000 workers in the textile and sawmill industries LO and the social democrats (among others) arranged a general strike involving 300 000 workers. It failed miserably of course but that is not the point, the point is they were involved directly with the workers movement in a very real way from their very inception.

What has SD done that compares to that? Why not at the very least direct some of their massive propaganda network to propagate for union membership and union action? Why attempt to ally with the conservatives and not use their considerable share of the seats in parliament to support a Social democratic government whether they like it or not and **also** keep using it to promote stricter immigration policies? SD talks about how they're the party for the ""common man"" and a party for people who would like to see a return to the old people's home Sweden but they make friends with liberal conservatives and christian democrats and make the social democrats their nemesis. Is this how a party for the workers acts? The left party don't like the social democrats either and they don't act like this.

Other than immigration SD is also interested in stuff like restricting abortion, how does that help the common man? They want to reintroduce cotaxation, what the fuck does that do other than lower taxes for people rich enough that their wife (or husband let's be all progressive here) doesn't have to work?

Voting for SD is like meeting a cute girl when you're out and about, things go well and you go back to her place. But just as you're getting ready her rich boyfriend Stanwell the third bursts out of the closet and fucks you in the ass. While you're being reamed the girl tells you how she's so proud of you for taking it like a champ and she tells you about this other guy Mohammed and how he got fucked so hard he cried.

3002,"Yeah, Locke owned slaves. He wasn't exactly neutral in this. His ideas about personal freedom did not extent to black people because he did not consider them people. He didn't think they were rational beings, and he used racism to justify their brutal treatments. Whatever failings my ideology has, they're not as bad as Locke's. His ideas about ""personal freedom"" explicitly did not extend to black people. Or women. Or Native Americans. Or poor people. It was actually very limited, so I don't see why I should believe in it, considering how horribly people who didn't have ""personal freedom"" were treated.

It's also very simple to see that there's a one sided power relation between white people and black people. Look at empire and slavery. Look at wealth and international influence. Look at what Locke and Enlightenment contemporaries said then look at what the people who followed after said, right up until today. It isn't racial profiling. It's acknowledging that there's a long history of discrimination and legal oppression - all of which can be documented - that leads to today. Are you going to tell me that black people in the U.S. had equal rights and opportunities throughout American history? Or that Africa wasn't colonized and Africans were brutally mistreated? Or Asians?  

I'm not saying it's a perfect system. I have my criticisms of it (Locke's racist liberalism wasn't unique, and modern international capitalism as it exists today relies on racism, so just putting black people or women in positions of power does nothing to change the systems or how they function). But it's something. It at least acknowledges that race exists, gets its historical context right, and tries to offer a solution, which is more than its right-wing detractors can claim to have.  

It's certainly not apartheid though, which was what you were asserting and I was responding to.  ",,/r/europe/comments/9e3pek/the_witcher_netflix_series_to_make_major_change/e5m9jyz/,BolsheMick,1536425330

3. People are constantly being outed as being or having ties to nazis. The party claims to have a ""zero tolerance"" on nazis but somehow the party seems to be filled with them. Makes you wonder how many nazis are still in the party.

3107,"What an idiotic thing to say...

First of all, *all* religions place value on tradition. You don't exactly see Buddhist monks walking around with rainbow robes, Jews reading from a translated Torah lit by a circular menorah, or Indus working in the tech industry praying to Steve Jobs or Bill Gates as an incarnation of Ganesha the Bringer of Fortune.

In the case of the Orthodox Christianity, they are fortunate enough to have been able to ascribe greater meaning to things that a layman would consider ""aesthetic details"".

One of the key features that distinguishes Catholicism (and by extent most mainstream versions of Protestantism) from Orthodoxy is that the former asserted itself in a context of a collapsing Western Roman Empire under the patronage of barbarian warlords. This severed the connection between Western Christianity and Classical Antiquity and forced Catholicism to evolve out of a ""cultural clean slate"". Contrasting with this apparent ""hands off"" approach in regards to form, came concentration of the religious authority in the hands of the Bishop of Rome (aka the Pope), which become the sole purveyor of the rightful religious (and by extent intellectual) doctrine and dogma in Western Europe. 

Orthodoxy, on the other hand, stems from an Eastern tradition that had a very concrete and material example of what Christianity was supposed to look like for the next 1000 years, called Byzantium. Another thing that sets Orthodoxy apart from Western Christianity is the fact that Orthodoxy *always* contemplated a measure of plurality in the interpretation and definition of Dogma: There is no Orthodox Pope. Instead, Orthodox Chistianity operates under a system of autocephaly, where every region has a say in the definition of what is and isn't Orthodoxy.

In short, Western Christianity placed less restrictions on the forms of buildings but had much more imposing attitude in regards to Christian Doctrine and Dogma and by extent the entirity of intellectual discourse in Europe, whereas Orthodoxy placed more restrictions of the forms of buildings but had much more plural attitude over what should and should not be considered dogmatic interpretations by virtue of those requiring consensus between disparate peoples.

And regardless of the historical context, there is no denying that some of the most universally acclaimed contributions to the domains of arts, sciences and literature come from Eastern Europe, which basically nukes the entire ""orthodoxy kills creativity"" argument outright all in itself.

Good, an so now you have the opportunity to show the correct course of action. Why don't you? Or do you think that solidarity only makes sense if it starts with benefitting you?

&gt;We differ here then. We don’t need to label anyone, people who are not citizens of Poland or EU have no right to just enter and live in Poland, there are laws about it. 

You control the laws, don't hide behind legality.

&gt;If they seek asylum they stay in refugee centers until they are processed, that’s the deal, their choice if the take it, real refugees do, welfare shopper don’t.

It's baffling how you complain in the same sentence that refugees are ""welfare shoppers"" but at the same time you refuse to let them do something useful for society.

I can't even disagree with it because I don't understand how you even come to that conclusion. It's not even wrong, it's nonsense.

&gt;Prevention. In Europe we forbid driving after alcohol because very small percentage of such drivers cause accidents. Sorry, but we won’t sacrifice one person to be raped and killed, not one. So either we find solution that ensures our population safety or no deal.

Well, if that was true alcohol would be banned in Poland, quod non.

If apartheid's fundamental idea is to separate race and keep the ""superior"" race in political, economic, and social control then most media people experience, the best schools, and the leaders on T.V. are all going to be filled with the most powerful racial group. Undoing it means functionally doing the opposite by breaking racial hegemony through raising and making more prominent racial minority groups in those same areas. Giving access itself isn't enough because there are social and economic barriers to entry, like good schooling and social connections, that would just create a de facto segregation - kind of like what happened in the U.S. 
 
The idea here is to do the opposite and to prevent de facto segregation from continuing. By giving opportunities to people of color to show their skills (because the conceit is they've been denied equal opportunities because they were considered inherently lesser), you're attacking the fundamental myths of white supremacy and the economic conditions that built those myths. 

In other words, its ends and means are completely different. An apartheid way of doing this would be the oppressed racial groups rising up, declaring themselves a singular group, then passing laws that oppressed their oppressor in the same way for the purpose of racial equality.

3240,"&gt; During the Conjunction of the Spheres, part of the elves from the main world, later described as the Aen Seidhe world, left their kin and, using portals, came to a new world. They took the new world for their own and started to call themselves Aen Elle - the Alder folks. **That world however was inhabited by two intelligent species - humans and unicorns. The elves started to wage war with both of them and eventually they completely eradicated all the humans and their settlements.**

&gt; For some time, everything was great for the elves and their civilization thrived. They built a beautiful palace known as Tir ná Lia that served as their capital. **However, after some time, the elves wanted servants or better yet, slaves**. The only other sentient beings on their world were unicorns, who they constantly battled with, and unicorns were obviously not very well suited to be slaves. **Around that time, the elves managed to force some of the unicorns to open the Gate of the Worlds - Ard Gaeth - giving them access to all possible worlds to massacre as they pleased**. **Thus the elven King Auberon Muircetach ordered the creation of a cavalry unit with a single goal: to invade alien worlds and capture young humanoids to serve as slaves**. The cavalry was named Dearg Ruadhri (meaning Red Riders) due to their red cloaks. **The king appointed General Eredin Bréacc Glas as the Red Riders' leader for he was an efficient and ruthless soldier** with strong magical abilities.

By having qualifications that they have to meet, as well as going into niche subsections. Also, by having the state provide measures to protect regional and cultural practices, which it can and sometimes  does. At the end of the day, though, you can still sell abroad even as a small company. In fact, for niche companies who target a small segment, having a bit common market IS important. Yes, not every company makes it, and changes  are often hard to manage, but a lot of the doom and gloom are about mismanagement at the local  and national level that would be there anyway. 

Every last goddamn directive that you complain about has gone through the council, most have gone through the European parliament, and all of them had to be implemented and modified by the national parliament. The EU is not some weird faceless alien overlord: almost everything that happened had your politicians voting for it. In many cases, they could have done far more on the implementation and provided safeguards for the industry and agriculture, but they did not. The pressure to go for the free market solution would still have been there, probably even stronger as multinational corporations could not be met by a joint front and could play everyone against everyone else. At the end of the day, most of what went on would have gone just as badly - or worse - without the EU.

Not publicly these days. But the founding members of SD came from all over the Swedish far right. Perhaps the my translation is off but at the time the organisations they drew their founding members from were commonly referred to as the ""vit makt-rörelsen"" i.e. the ""white power movement"". If the organisations involved weren't directly national socialist they were very much white supremacist. Even if a person doesn't say ""white's are better"" you don't have to make any great logical leaps to realize that when they are talking about ""protecting ethnic swedes"" they mean that any outsider is subpar and less-than.

3316,"There are several theories in literature about the etymological origin of the word ketchup. The most widespread is the claim that it goes back to a Chinese term. The term ketchup has its origin first in British cookbooks and then in the USA, until it finally came into the German-speaking area.

In his book Pure Ketchup, Andrew F. Smith has comprehensively presented all known derivation attempts. The British cookbook author Elizabeth David believes that ketchup was derived from the English term caveach, an acetic marinade for cooked fish. The US anthropologist E. N. Anderson favours the origin of the French word escaveche, which was generally used to describe food in a sauce, which then became caveach in English.

If anything, I think the wave of reconstructions in Europe over the last few decades is a *broader* reaction against contemporary architecture, which many view as sterile and globalist (i.e. not interacting with local culture, history, or climate). Sure, this is something the right would be big on, because of their often intense and radical views on national identity. But this, once again, ignores that regular people also desire a sense of culture and local identity. Not the toxic, harmful kind that the right espouses, but identity still. The fact that most of these reconstructions start as citizen initiatives and are even funded by the citizenry supports this idea.

Ecomists are just that, economists. A soldier that is paid 100 coins is not as effective as 10 soldiers who are paid 10 coins each, assuming the relatively same equipment. Training and time spent in the force has diminshing returns unless actual combat experience can be gathered. A force of 20 000 is not as effective as 200 000 because numbers might say so. If ""all military economists agree"" then why are some countries gravitating back to conscription? If your answer is patriarchy and nazis, I am going to ignore it.

Global firepower is not really a reliable source for ranking armies, because different armies have very different objectives. Please do not try to use it as an credible source. It makes very little sense, doesnt actually tell how it conducts the ""index"", uses outdated numbers 70% of time and adds factors and ratios to the numbers because some dude somewhere decided to do so. And how Sweden is 20 places above Finland I never comprehend, even looking at the numbers on site. I'm guessing it's because of swedish airforce. Hold, it has also Norway and Denmark above Finland, and again I cannot understand why looking at the numbers. Point here being is that Global Firepower sucks, and it cannot be used to compare militaries in vacuum.

&gt;Wars aren't won with numbers of men any more; they are won through equipment; a tank staffed by three men is worth a thousand men on foot.

Now this comment here is pretty telling imo that you have very little idea what you are talking about,and I have no idea why are you claiming anything like this. I dont think that this conversation is going to lead anywhere. To put it again: you cannot compare armies in vacuum. Well, you can. But it is a pretty pointless exercise at that point. Of course if you put 1000 dudes to an open field without any equipment and a tank there 1 km away, the men on foot will die.

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: I am not saying that FDF in current state is doing conscription the right way. I am saying that thinking that professional army is a one-size-fits-all solution is completly false, and usually comes from people who have very little about the situation Finland is in, how thin the population is spread and how long our borders are. And from people who think that comparing armed forces in a vacuum without considering the terrain, political situation, available resources, level of training of the forces and what kind of war they are going to fight gives anything remotely useful.

EDIT: To add, IMO there is not a correct solution. Economists might be right that paid small army would be efficient, but in what scenario? In peace keeping, sure.

I don't know. Why are they not in government now? If they just borrow 19  votes from SD today, they would be bigger than the left. Borrow 35 and they are in a majority. 

Maybe they recognize that it's more important to no give into hate and fear, like in the US, than to get your will on everything. 

FRP and SD are close on many issues, but SD are more radical with immigration. They also are also publicly racist/difference hating in a way that FRP is not. The leadership of FRP have taken a stance against SD. For instance, SD wants to send refugees home when a crisis is resolved. FRP does not take this stance. The far-right whom is attracted to SD in Sweden is attracted to parties like Liberalistene or Alliansen in Norway.

Or maybe you just handwave direct tries at implementation like you do everytime something fails and fall it something else because it ruins your image of this ideology ?

&gt;You don't know it but most of our capitalist economic theory has some bases on Marx

Are you actually researcher for real ? Seriously i start to doubt it.
Explain me why in feudal systems kings had storages with food in case of crop failures ? Or why they build dams ? Or why they sponsored arts ? Or why they sponsored science ?

Feudalism practically ended before marx was even born so attributing anything related to betterment of people lives to marx is your own personal failure as historian in first place. Next you will probably talk how it was thanks to Marx that people lives improved and how he managed to reform evil factories or something.


Why farmers choose to work in those evil factories ? Why they didn't go back to those fun farms they had peaceful life in ?

Because life at farm is fucking worse than in factory where you have just 10 hours of work and later on you can actually spend some money on education in bar or buy some shit you wouldn't be able to afford by living on farm working 12 hours a day and at the end of the day you would still not have money to do anything.

&gt;I bet you haven't even read his Wikipedia article.

I have read his books mate and i also listened few people who are articulate enough to completely unpack whole ideology from foundation and expose internal problems with it that made it such potent tool to kill people in name of ""good"".

For example fundamental part of marx ideology is that inequality is structure of power. Meaning that if you have more than me then it means you got it by foul means and i have moral right to now kill/rape/steal from you.

This is why every nation that tried to implement his ideas has failed into murderous tyranny. Because you can't make people equal and the more equal you want them to be the more force you need to use. And this is why exactly your ""this wasn't real communism it was xxx"" doesn't work.

The European Commission plans to approve a legislative project next Wednesday to establish for the first time a genuine European border police and turn the controversial control of irregular migration into a community competence. The historic project is the core of Jean-Claude Juncker's last speech on the state of the European Union, which will take place on September 12 in Strasbourg.

The president of the Commission prepares an intervention before the European Parliament that does not pretend to be neither a legacy nor a balance of his mandate since 2014. Rather it aspires to become a powerful work agenda for the last exercise of a Commission that will be relieved to end of 2019. And as a faithful reflection of the times, most of the initiatives point to a shielding of Europe, both in the physical terrain of the borders and in the digital of social networks.

In last year's speech, the commercial opening was one of the main bases of his intervention, in response to the protectionism promoted by Donald Trump from the White House. But now, just a few months before the European elections in May 2019, Brussels will try to demonstrate to citizens that the continent is not vulnerable to uncontrolled migratory flows or external interference in matters as crucial as electoral processes. A double wave of last minute that aims to reassure public opinion and remove arguments from rising populist currents. Brussels takes sides in the future electoral battle and is aimed at the side of the recovery of European sovereignty captained by French President Emmanuel Macron.

Juncker's speech will come accompanied by the approval of several legislative projects, among which the creation of a true European Guard of Coasts and Borders, with surveillance capacity in European territory, possibility of intervening in third countries and powers to participate in the irregular return operations.

The proposal was considered for years, but has never gone ahead by the tremendous reluctance it raises in several countries, particularly the southern ones, fearful of a cession of sovereignty that implies losing part of a competence as sensitive as the surveillance of the territory. But the Commission believes that the latest migration crisis, sparked by Italy's refusal to allow the landing of people rescued at sea, has shown that the national management of migratory flows has become obsolete and must be passed on to a centralized management.

If it is consummated as Brussels expects, the tremendous leap of federalizing foreign surveillance will end the cession of sovereignty of a policy that took its first steps with the creation of Frontex in 2004 and that was reinforced with the creation in 2016 of a European Guard of coasts and borders, still subject to the control of the national authorities. Both milestones were an advance, but European sources acknowledge that ""it has not gone beyond coordination and information management"".

The current Guard has about 1,500 troops deployed and their intervention is subject to the request of the countries and to the collaboration with national forces that total more than 100,000 troops. Brussels has already proposed to raise to 10,000 troops the European guard before 2020 and, with the proposal next Wednesday, provide it with a centralized command and broad powers.

Juncker will propose at the same time an improvement of legal emigration channels, with a view to facilitating entry into Europe through foreseeable and controlled channels. But in this case the proposals are presented in the form of Communication, a format with a much lower range than the legislative project to shield the borders. A clear message in content and form.

**Cyber attacks**

The Commission will also adopt measures to try to guarantee the integrity of the European elections of May 2019. It is the largest electoral process in the world, after India. And the interference risk is multiplied by 27, the number of participating countries (once discounted UK).

Juncker plans to require social networks to remove fraudulent information in less than an hour after detection. And strengthen the surveillance on possible electronic interference in the powerful electoral machinery that will be launched between May 23 and 26, 2019, the four days in which the 705 members of the European Parliament will be elected (59 in Spain).

Brussels fears that cyber attacks and disinformation campaigns suffered in recent elections, from the US to France and attributed in general to activists linked to Russia will be repeated.",Castilla-La Mancha (Spain),/r/europe/comments/9e2yas/the_european_commission_promotes_a_community/e5lqsvj/,MostOriginalNickname,1536397196

3502,"I don't know about that. If Russia really were to make a major push into Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltics, they could probably accomplish that by the end of the month. In Western Europe and the US, the real question would be whether or not they should retaliate with nuclear force. In the following nuclear war, no one would really win, but Western Europe and America would win a little more.

If there is a conventional war, the effectiveness of Western Europe would be based entirely around coordination. The EU has a standing army of ~1.5m, and there are sure to be conscripts, but that doesn't mean anything if the forces are disjointed and organized. There's no real clear military command structure in the EU. Russia and the EU are relatively toe-to-toe strength-wise, but the Russian military would be a lot more cohesive.

So, the Russians fight their way through the Baltics and Eastern Europe, into Poland. There'd probably an attempt to try to retake the Baltics, but it'd more than likely fail. There might be some minor insurgencies in some of the regions, but not enough to really make a significant difference.

Most of this hypothetical war would take place in Poland. It'd be a slow push for the Russians - their supply lines would be really strained. At the same time, the Anglo-Franco-Germanic-Pole European defense is also running out of steam. Yes, Europe has a much better economy with far more factories and a higher population than Russia, but in an era where a single fighter jet can take a year to build, these advantages don't really become prevalent. This war wouldn't be like WWII, with hundreds of planes being cranked out every week.

Regardless, the Russians reach the point where they can no longer push forward. French, German, and UK strikes on ground forces become much more common. A strained Russia would probably recede from Poland and fortify their new borders, and a weakened Europe wouldn't be able to push any further.

The whole of the war would last anywhere from six months to a year, depending on the strength and numbers of the forces at play.

I didn't say repealed fully, I said decriminalized.

&gt; Still there are bestselling books like that from Akif Pirincci 

So in your argument to prove that native Germans are homophobes, and in trying to argue that I'm a migrant-hater who believes nonsense about how migrants are you.... **mention a book written by a homophobic Turkish immigrant?**

&gt;Meanwhile, homosexuals aren't realky helped by voting for the AfD as a party that's rallying against homosexuality itself 

Now, I don't know the AfD's platform on LGBt specifically very well, I assume it's more ""no gay marriage"" and ""not too much gay adoption"" but aside from that not any ""gay people should be in jail"" or ""gay people don't have the same rights"". But let's say it is, let's say that gay people would have to start hiding being gay in public if the AfD rose to power - the problem is that a lot of people feel as if Islamism is on the rise in Europe, specifically Germany, and the numbers agree that fundamental and political Islam is on the rise (salafism as a sect is growing year by year, for example).

So eventually it's only logical that more and more gay people see it as a choice between ""party that wants to prevent me from getting married but will protect me from people that will behead me"" versus ""party that wants me to be able to marry but refuses to even mention that there's people that want to behead me"".

That's all I'm saying. I'm not gay myself but I can understand this feeling, and I've noticed it resonate in several LGBT friends of mine.

I'm not trying to argue that there is no homophobia in native Germans, and I'm not saying that gay people can't face discrimination by native Germans. I know there is and I know they do. Unfortunately there are always those mentally challenged 'tough guys' that are like that, what I'm saying is that I disagree with your claim that it's 'widespread' and I'm saying the problem is FAR more prevalent among migrants, and that that is why gay people (not just in Germany) tend to swing more to parties that are against gay marriage etc, because they happen to be the ONLY parties that seriously talk about the worst group of homophobes in Europe (Muslims).

Or, it hits the flank of the boat, now I can’t give you the actual speed of these missiles and weight to calculate the force that one of them put on the carcass of a boat since they are classified and I am not the engineer in charge of them but if you watch a video from the malouin war.

This is mostly true actually. It's commonplace in the Commonwealth Realms, Western Europe and places like Singapore. It's also something you don't really need evidence for in that it's common knowledge. Ask on any youth forum in the UK and you'll find out about the anti-immigration sentiments for the British Indian community.

&gt;Also not true; emigrants still contribute to the economy of the country the leave through connections &amp; most are not of the most privileged class.

Actually, for India the majority are the privileged class. This is especially true for the asylum seekers that the left-wing loves to fight for. This problem is grave enough that academic reports have been done.

&gt; The left did not equate immigration with racism. The far right made the conversation about racism by opposing immigration on the grounds of race. Enoch Powell's speech, for example, was explicitly based on racial paranoia.

&gt; Free movement between countries is good for the economic development of both countries involved, which is part of why it is a central component of the EU. Many countries with high rates of emigration (such as Ireland) are doing better economically than they every have.

3759,"&gt;The Dublin-based airline suffered its worst ever strikes this summer, as action by pilots and cabin crew forced it to cancel flights, including to major holiday destinations such as Italy, Portugal and Spain.
&gt;
&gt;It secured a breakthrough in August after reaching a deal with striking Irish pilots and said it was hopeful it could secure deals in other markets.

-

&gt;He said the two Italian unions also had pilot members and that the unions would invite pilots and ground staff across Europe to join their cabin crew colleagues in the strike.

Ballsy lads.

[Self-Flying Planes May Arrive Sooner Than You Think. Here's Why](https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/self-flying-planes-may-arrive-sooner-you-think-here-s-ncna809856)

&gt;The technology is here, but will we trust planes without pilots?

-

&gt; Airbus is developing an autonomous air taxi dubbed Vahana. The tilt-wing, multi-propeller craft is designed to take off and land in tight spaces and able to fly about 50 miles before its batteries need recharging.
&gt;
&gt;Vahana is intended for short urban hops — but what about long flights? How far away are we from a pilotless airliner?

-

&gt; Airbus’s main rival, Boeing, has hinted that such a craft might be on the way. At the Paris Air Show last summer, Mike Sinnett, the company’s vice-president of product development, said “the basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available.” Key elements, including the artificial intelligence system “that makes decisions that pilots would make,” will be tested next year.
&gt;
&gt;Even before truly pilotless airliners show up, we may see a reduction in cockpit crew numbers.
&gt;
&gt;Shrinking Cockpit crews
&gt;
&gt;“What the industry is telling me is that they would like to remove one of the pilots fairly soon, and re-design the cockpit around a single pilot,” says Stephen Rice, a professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. That would involve at least a modest cockpit redesign, so that a single pilot is able to operate all of the controls. “There might also be a remote-control pilot on the ground, in case of emergencies, like a heart attack,” he adds. “This remote pilot could monitor many airplanes [at once].” But eventually “they would like to remove the last pilot.”
&gt;
&gt;This wouldn’t be the first time the aviation industry has cut back on crews. In the 1950s, it took five people to fly an airliner — two pilots, a flight engineer, a radio operator, and a navigator. By the 1960s, the radio operator and navigator were gone. In the 1990s, flight engineers disappeared. Given this trend, fully automated aviation may seem inevitable.
&gt;
&gt;One motive for the trend, not surprisingly, is financial. A report released last August suggests that by transitioning to self-flying aircraft the aviation industry could save $35 billion a year.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9dxj4y/ryanair_crew_consider_biggest_strikes_in_companys/e5lesto/,vokegaf,1536377670

3821,"There are a number of reasons that I don't look at PPP, for one, it's really hard to gauge on a country like China. Iraq hardly produces anything, China produces pretty much everything. 

On things like a Big Mac, and iPad, it's possible it's more expensive in China. On things like everyday items, China is cheaper. 

I'm not saying nominal is perfect, but at some point there needs to be a measurement that isn't purely subjective, which is what PPP is. You can't include everything in its calculations, and even if you could different people have different needs, and different wants, no matter how you calculate it, it's subjective.

Overall it's not a good idea to gauge based on Per Capita anyways, or even GDP for that matter, but it's a culmination of things that may have a broader picture, if not at all accurate. It's suppose to be used as a guide rather than a definitive measure.

Lastly, even if we were to look at PPP, China has crossed it by 2018 figures.But again, that's not an accurate measure of much. ",,/r/europe/comments/9dwanx/despite_having_8_times_smaller_population_eu_has/e5l6w7b/,BeforeAfterDawn,1536368156

3834,"To be fair Kenya has possibly one of the most optimistic futures of all the African nations (as well as some of Maghreb nations) and also with a bit of digging through all the non-credible sources and nothingness articles,  I found a Pdf with CNN writer Charles Robinsom stating how Sub-saharan Africa will have an economy of 29 trillion by 2050, 

a dubious claim but not entirely impossible if the population continues to explode as expected, but the expectation that this money will actually benefit the regular household in Africa is pretty naive.

 Nigerias economy is growing, but it's people aren't benefiting, only 26% of students paying for 3rd level education got in, this great effects a country's future growth and development of a middle class, the money to expand the education faculties is siphoned off to politicians and industries that make short term profit such as the oil drilling in the Nile delta. I do think most of Africa's future will improve but just like most of the southern hemisphere it'll be slow and probably unsteady. 

Latin America, the has been waiting for this supposed boom to come for decades, similarly so has South East Asia, they only time the economies surprisingly boom is when there's considerable outside pressure for them to do so, such as was the case for South Korea and west Germany.

I mean this is bullshit. Who buys into this? Polling stations are polling stations. If their results are off, it's because they used a poor methology, not because of political bias. What would you even gain from it? At best you could motivate the side that thinks they are loosing. Polling stations want to get it as right as possible to continue to appear credible.

If you ask a random Japanese person what second language they speak which is more likely:

French

German


Italian

English

English is the main second language taught around the world, that means that academics from other countries are far more likely to speak English as a second language than any other language.

Compare that to India, with many many languages, all of them spoken by millions each. It's also much more vulnerable to climate change, and it has a much weaker state, not just cause its democratic but just cause it has far less resources compared to China. Also the Chinese population will be significantly lower by the end of the century, while India's growth rate is still double that of China's, although it has been consistently slowing down.

Yes, five days after it, after the Greece tried to annex the island via a declared fascist state. Things have started by the '63 though. 

&gt; Nothing happened before. In fact the Turkish Cypriot population was rising.. not decreasing...

I'm not sure who said you that just because a population hasn't been exterminated, it means that mass massacres, oppression or ethnic cleansings plans can't be a thing. Of course, that's some weird perspective you have there.

Akritas Plan is up there in Wikipedia if you just stick to your highschool education, while Bloody Christmas and the treatment of Turkish Cypriots up to the junta are stuff anyone can find via a simple search.

&gt; Remind me where all the Armenians disappeared to in turkey? Or the massacre of Greeks in turkey?

So because a country committed massacres and cleansings on a larger scale, things happened in Cyprus suddenly disappears?

&gt; Where is turkeys greek/Armenian and even Jewish community?

Armenians, ones in Armenian Highlands has been deported and perished on the way since the march and the mass massacres.

Greeks, Pontics clashed with the indigenous Laz and other natives, and at the end, some got cleansed and the rest have been gone to Greece with the other Greeks aside from the ones in Istanbul, due to the population exchange that Greece has demanded.

There is a specific term in German courts that get's used for it: Stillschweigende Zustimmung

The meaning is close to implied consent but not exactly, silent / unspoken / tacit approval is more in the league.

Meaning, if police for example asks you if they can search your vehicle and you don't verbally deny their request, your silence is regarded as approval.

So yes, if there are people in your group that you don't agree with, you should make that clear and not sit by silently. After all, if you are in a group, your presence is making the group bigger therefore making the opinion stronger / more valid.

Social Democrats (Social Democracy) 

Green Party (ecopolitics)

Left Party (Democratic Socialism)

*Together they have* ***36,8%*** *of the votes assuming that the Green Party passes the 4% limit needed to gain any mandate (which I personally believe they will). The left party is technically not part of this coalition but they provide them with support.* 

**The Right Coalition**

Moderate Party (Liberal Conservatism)

*Center Party (Social Liberalism)*

*Liberals (Social Liberalism)* 

Christian Democrats (Christian Democracy) 

*Together they have* ***33%*** *of the votes assuming that they remain loyal to each other and that the Christian Democrats or the Liberals don't fall under the 4% limit (I believe they will stay).* 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Sweden Democrats** (National Conservatism) 

This is Swedens nationalist party who has been growing rapidly ever since joining the parliament back in 2010. Neither the left nor the right coalition is interested in having them on their side which has put them in an awkward spot. 

*They currently have*  ***24,8%*** *of the votes and will most likely vote against both the Left and Right coalitions attempt at forming a government. This might spark a re-election or some other drastic measure.*

**Parties outside of the Parliament:** 

Feminist initiative: This is as the name implies a very feminist. They were close to getting into the parliament in 2014 but has since then declined in popularity. It's therefore unlikely that they will make it this year.

You can also tell that 4,8% of those asked are voting for a party not large enough to recieve proper representation. It's unlikely that any of these parties will make it to the parliament as you need at least 4% to do so. The only contender I can think of is Alternative for Sweden which essentially is an Alt-Right party. They might get a few % of the votes but are highly highly unlikely to get into the parliament.

4084,"&gt; When a European farmer picks some apples and sells them to me and I eat them, they produce a multiple of the nominal ""value"" of an African farmer doing the same, just because the purchasing power is so different.

Not really. A large portion of Africa falls under the ""[Everything But Arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_but_Arms)"" program, which means that those countries can export everything except weaponry to the EU without having to pay duties.

So when you buy apples... well, you're probably buying them from the supermarket, if you don't live in a rural area where they grow them. But when the supermarket buys apples, it buys them on the open market where European and African farmers are both competing with each other on price. They all end up costing more or less the same from the supermarket's point of view, because they'd just buy the cheapest apples that are still edible. And an euro is just an euro on the international market.

No doubt transport is more expensive for the Africans, but on the other hand labour is more expensive for the Europeans.

Yes it does.

Was it that finance minister or something? Because pretty sure that's a scare tactic to try to get all of the EU countries to agree on a budget. But there is some validity in what he's saying.

&gt; And yes, most countries out of the remaining 27 couldn’t afford it.

And the remaining 27 countries can easily afford to cover the gap that Britain leaves as the 4rd largest contributor after Italy. They are just bickering over the amount and from whom. Not that they need to if UK wants to stay in the EEA.

Because a lot of companies rely on uniterrupted supply and demand from the common market, and barring a massive change of opinion and policy the EU won't give them free access to the common market without access to the UK market for goods and persons, which Brexiteers do not want.

"" They will be free from all EU treaties  ""

Sure - including many which they have supported and benefitted with, which they now have to renegotiate with much lower leverage.

""  they keep their international treaties. ""

The thing is, many of their older treaties were updated through the EU and the old ones are no longer valid - and they won't automatically become valid when the UK leaves. They'll need to be done all over again, fast and with a worse position (since everyone knows the UK is in a hurry). 

"" Whatever they do, it will be their choice ""

Yes, and no one denies they have the right to choose. However, they are responsible for the consequences.

"" not an order coming from a crooked European Commission.""  
The European Commission doesn't give orders out of nowhere. Everything has to get ok'd through both the European parliament and  a council made of representatives from the elected national government, and on various issues every single member can impose a veto in the latter. THEN, most cases are handled with directives, which are give broad guidelines and leave the actual lawmaking to the national governments.

4102,"Over where? Well, I will try to keep it simple, which is hard, because it has depth beyond my dreams.

The goal of the EU is to strengthen economies and ensure peace on the continent. This has been done mainly and initially by making nation's economies dependant on each other. One thing that has been produced in the Netherlands can be a component for another product in the UK. This has been made possible by dropping tariffs and imposing regulatory alignment. Everything that comes in to the country or goes out of the country has the same seal of approval. So border checks are rare. Britain has joined the Union 40 years ago. So this means that our economies are already pretty intertwined. A British made car could be only for 60% made in Britain, the parts of that car can have crossed the channel multiple times, frictionless. This process is helped by JIT (Just In Time) delivery which relies on margins of minutes if not seconds for parts to arrive at the factory. This eliminates the need for big warehouses. This dissappears with Brexit. Period.

Frictionless trade is also handy when dealing with foodstuffs. The 2.6 million lorrys that cross the channel every year, one change in time taken at the border, one systematic hiccup, and you have lorrys on the highway you could build a space elevator with. Not to mention all trade that goes through the ports. Rotting foodstuff at the border because customs could become reality.

All agreements the EU has with the rest of the world, which is virtually tariff free trade with almost 60 countries also stops to apply to the UK. It is also losing its schedule at the WTO, which they relied on at the EU. They need to renegotiate that. With a guaranteed worse outcome.

This is trade, simplified. 

You have freedom of movement, which stops, and has already led to labor shortages on farms in England. If the fruit can not be picked, it won't get sown. You have the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland which ensured peace there. But this also relies on free movement of people and an invisible border.

You have all kinds of safety regulations which ensure workers safety, safety of transport of hazardous goods, dozens and dozens of agreements that need to be copied to British law, if they want, and recognized by the other party, again.

You have air travel arrangements, which cease to exist, we could have landed planes in March 2019.

You have fishery, because the EU and the UK share fishing grounds. They will probably stay the same for a while, but if conflicts arise, who knows.

You have law and the most important international arbiter, the ECJ, which the UK doesn't want to abide to anymore. This gives a whole new set of problems because trade conflicts or normal conflicts within the EU get solved there. Which means another hurdle they lay themselves on the road for trading. Drivers licences are a good example, if you want to go to the EU, you can do that with your own UK drivers license, not after Brexit, you need a special permit because that agreement will not exist anymore. Not a problem you would say, just ask the council to print you one. If you are a lorry driver, you need to do that every so often, which costs time and money. Moreover, suddenly there is need for an administrative branch that people have not needed for 40 years.

Don't mention medicine coming from the EU. They are stockpiling stuff just in case something in the Brexit process is not smooth. Some things are not possible to stockpile, like cancer treatment radio-actives, so what happens there, I don't know. It is a fucking mess. I think the EU will come up with something, but being at the whims of another entity on fucking cancer treatment for a whole population... Imagine that. Let that sink in.

Since the vote in 2016, Britain has lost close to 200.000 jobs, 2% of economic output and emergency measures have been taken by the bank of England. The economy has slowed down from being the fastest growing in the G7 to the slowest. The UK has dropped from 5th place in the list of biggest economies to 6th. The pound is unstable and lost 10% of its value. Interests have been raised for the first time in 10 years. All of this, and more, before the UK has even left the bloc.

Basically, they are closing themselves off from the world, from people, production and trade, which doesn't work anymore. It is madness! And frankly, it drives me mad.

The French can mass produce these (that are even better now) meaning if you let a french plane get anywhere near you fleet, it will be obliterated and will sink so imagine if you throw 100 of them, no more fleet at all.

So some French engineers (that are in the «french navy ») told me that more than 1 or two ships would be at this moment practically useless and when I asked him how you could deal with the American navy theoretically he said that it wouldn’t be that hard to sink a fleet with exo-7 missiles and submarines and he said that big fleets are only really efficient against countries that are not as developed like middle east countries.

Blaming Islam for all FGM in Southeast Asia because they introduced it in the 13th century is kind of like blaming Egypt for all worldwide FGM since they (may have) introduced it in \~1900 BCE. 

Just to be clear, I'm not actually blaming Egypt. From the rest of the article, it looks like clerics in Egypt are fighting against FGM pretty strongly. 

When we're talking about Southeast Asia, we're pretty  much talking about Indonesia. The Indonesian government has been slow to move against FGM, but in 2016 they [stepped up their efforts](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/09/26/indonesia-seeks-end-female-genital-mutilation) to fight FGM. They've got a ways to go, but fighting the Indonesian government (or trying to get the country to convert from Islam to another religion) is not likely to produce faster results.

I'll make a casual observation based upon personal experience. As perhaps an interesting point of consideration, not as an assertion.

I find a sizable chunk of technicians, who can all be very different from each other, across a very diverse range of personality types, share some mild character traits with autisms… Now keep with me just a moment, or you could really get the wrong end of the stick... Out of inclination, rather than necessity. That is, all things being equal, they simply prefer to think in a particular way. As does everybody, just their preferred way of thinking, shares some traits with autism. Which has advantages, in the case of a technicians some quite compelling advantages. In many cases they are paid more to think more like an autistic person, so are literally rewarded for it.

Its optional though and they are capable of different modes of thought. Its a switch, that they sometimes forget to change, or aren't fully aware that they can change at will. I've seen some devs change markedly in different social contexts, but not exercise choice to do so, until its pointed out to them that they can... actually, that would have been me.

Anyway, I'm not meaning to lecture, I just found it interesting is all.

After introduction it just became 5-50 kuna sitting in a bag that anyone can take as when it was introduced you would get cash and not coupons. I even remember going to one of the recycling stations with my mom when it was introduced to check it out and you'd get people who literally came in with multiple bags that were in the recycling cages beforehand.

Currently transport from Slovakia, Czechia, Hungary, Serbia has anyway better access to Polish than to German ports. What this road changes is situation of Romaniaand Bulgaria only, which have their own ports are far away and will rather use Greek port of Thessaloniki. The topic of Black Sea transit was already mentioned. Yes they may loose some, but not much.

I mentioned the other highway from Greece to Poland, as the Via Carpatia will serve similar purpose: mainly connecting countries and not sees. I am aware that Ukraine and Romania don't have good roads, but it's not about geopolitics, connecting seas, but poverty, corruption and inability to lead public investments in these countries.

You clearly don't do a lot of thinking. They are Ethiopian Jews, who happened to live in Ethiopia for thousands of years and have similar socioeconomic status. Regardless, I can use 'Ethiopian' women as shorthand for the Ethiopian Jewish women in question.

They don't have as many children. Check the Ashkenazi or even Mizrahi birth rates yourself.

On the other side, there are natural reasons why the situation may change dramatically even without them. 

1) English being only second language to most of Europeans, those more cosmopolitan, using English daily because working abroad and/or in multicultural (=English speaking) environment (tending to have that ""no borders"" attitude) have been probably highly overrepresented among the firstcommers. With latecomers the reverse would be probably true.

2) The real attitude of European society is probably slowly shifting a bit towards closing borders. Probably even among long time reddit users.

3) As with elections the effect of shifting voter's ratios is far from linear. The world where one strongly opinionated party wins majority by a small margin is radically different from the world where the other strongly opinionated party wins by the same small margin.

There would be even some psychological effects. With some users used to be downvoted for years but still contributing to the debate still present after power shift ... but some of the users not used to be downvoted (because being part of the ""ruling"" party) now leaving in disgust because suddenly being downvoted far more often.

Additionally however, what the study quietly showed was that by UCL's own estimates was that non-EEA migrants between 1995 - 2011 had taken out £95 billion more in benefits and services than they had given in taxes. In 2014 when the report was updated following the challenges from other institutions the figure was updated to closer to £114 billion.

However skipping over that whole debate it remains a hotly contested subject, with academics largely 50-50 on net positives and net negatives of the 1995 to 2011 migration. Migration watch have not been 'caught' fudging the data only contesting the study further regarding the EEA migrants too.

Those particular findings on the UCL study is taken from Douglas Murray's - The Strange Death of Europe:

1.	Fine companies a percentage of their total owning/controlling group’s market cap proportional to the fraction of the maximum sentence that could be imposed on a natural person who was incapable of rehabilitation for the same crime, or for the same share of their group’s gross income that a median person would be fined, plus treating any gains which could conceivably have come from the crime as proceeds of crime, all without the protection of the corporate veil
2.	treating employees and shareholders as accessories if they knew what was going on 
3.	requiring employers to pay out contracts to those who report their crimes (unless they are convicted of perjury) as if they had been unfairly dismissed or sexually harassed or whatever. 
4.	a “must prosecute” rule prohibiting officials from dropping cases against politicians, police, senior public officials, judges, the locally rich, and major businesses in the area, unless there’s convincing evidence that the original suspicion was baseless or that there is no plausible additional evidence that would make conviction valid. I’d also extend that to persons responsible for children in cases relating to their treatment of children, and eventually to everyone for all cases but that’s not currently affordable. 

The first makes it impractical to treat fines as a cost of doing business, the second forces workers to turn in their employers, the third protects them from retaliation, and the fourth ensures no-one is too important to prosecute.

4932,"This is why I have a problem with falsely accusing people of being nazis. Right now I have no idea if this guy is actually a neo-nazi or if OP is just making shit up. 

Back in the day when someone was labeled as a nazi, the first thought would have been to think what a cunt they are, but now instanteniously, regardless of who we're talking about, I start questioning the accuracy of the claims. 

Often the argument is then that the person has ""a lot of similarities to nazis"", as if thats supposed to mean something, I mean I myself am a vegetarian, as was Hitler, anti-tobacco, as was Hitler, I'm white, as was Hitler, I'm a man, as was Hitler, I'm a human, as was Hitler, but the fact that we have those similarities doesnt translate to me wanting to ethnically clean the jewish race or gas the gypsies, like jesus christ. That's just stupid.

The term has been watered down so much that its like calling someone a dumbass, just an insult. Which is just stupid because someone doesn't have to be a nazi to be a dumbass, so falsely labeling them as such doesnt make your point any more credible, if anything it corrupts you and your arguments credibility. You can just explain why they're a dumbass or why their position is wrong.

It just doesnt help your cause. If you're calling a jewish man a nazi, as I've unfortunately seen couple of times, people wont take your side and think that the guy is a dumbass, they will look at you and think that you're a dumbass. And its also annoying.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinia

&gt;It is the region with the lowest total fertility rate[142] (1.087 births per woman) and the second-lowest birth rate of Italy[143] (which is already one of the lowest in the world). Combined with the aging of population going rather fast (in 2009, people older than 65 were 18,7%), rural depopulation is quite a big issue: between 1991 and 2001, 71,4% of Sardinian villages have lost population (32 more than 20% and 115 between 10% and 20%), with over 30 of them being at risk to become ghost towns.[144] Nonetheless, the overall population has been increasing because of a considerable immigration flow, mainly from the Italian mainland, Eastern Europe (esp. Romania), Africa and Asia. 

It looks like over a quarter of the immigrant population is Romanian, though.  [Romania herself has a TFR of only 1.35](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2127.html), so that's going to, in significant part, transfer Italian demographic problems to Romania.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9dns9i/total_fertility_rate_in_the_eueftaeu_candidates/e5jb8vk/,vokegaf,1536290591

In regards to Germany? Nope.

&gt;Oh so the police statistics released by European countries are now false ? 

I never said that. Re-read what I said.

&gt;And is your argument really that crime again'st immigrants is somehow acceptable ?

No. But you're using X evidence to draw the conclusion that you should expel all immigrants and not let any in. Not because of logic, but because of illogical and frankly racist fear mongering.

The statistic I saw was something like 3% of the population is immigrants but 8% of the crime in Germany is caused by immigrants. But, as I said, that doesn't account for immigrant on immigrant crime.

This statistic is used to back up the belief that you should deny immigrants. It's 8%. Much of which is immigrants against immigrants. And we all know they would not be safer in the country they fled. 

So less than 8% of crime is caused by 3% of the population. We don't know exactly how much since immigrant on immigrant crime isn't accounted for but again, they are safer as immigrants.

Less than 8% is hardly that big of a number. It's not 100%, or 50%, or 25% or even 10%. So does it indicate that there is *more* crime amongst immigrants per capita? Sure. I will give you that small victory.

Does it also mean that it's morally justified to let women and children get murdered in another country because the dangers a few of the older men pose? Considering that you can give them a larger modicum of safety? No, it does not.

&gt;Literally at no point was the word hate mentioned, nor are we talking about a person.

So immigrants aren't people now? What are they then? Aliens? Half human? 3/5ths of a human?

5068,"&gt; People in this thread are talking about the benefits of being in the EU and working together to counter Russia economically via sanctions.

Which has already been going on for nearly 5 years, so when is the ""countering"" actually gonna happen?

&gt; It's also pretty pointless to group together on sanctions if one member of the EU can either block them, or effectively invalidate their usefulness because they benefit from the trade that would be sanctioned.

But nothing like that happened, sanctions have been enacted and renewed to this day, at an average cost of [$3.2 billion per months, while pushing the Russian GDP by around 1%](https://www.ecoi.net/en/file/local/1406014/1930_1504082857_g1722595.pdf).

This is Europe and Russia bleeding each other out, to what end?

&gt; Why is the legal difference (ignoring that there is a difference between the open use of military force, and the covert use of it) relevant? 

It was a rhetorical question to point out that [there is no difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrajudicial_killing), it makes zero difference if you have a soldier killing civilians as opposed to a spy, but thanks for playing. 

&gt; During the cold war the UK spent a lot of money in ensuring that there were soldiers, tanks aircraft and so on in Germany to deter what the UK, Germany and others thought was an expansionist and aggressive Russia. 

Also during the cold war:

- Germany had a standing army of 500.000 people, up to over a million with reserves..
- Russia was actually called the USSR
- Nasty spy shit was pretty much a constant, especially in Germany
- **They** build the wall, not sure how building walls is aggressive and expansionist, but have at it.
- NATO's ""defense policy"" back then was ""[rapid nuclear escalation](http://www.bpb.de/politik/grundfragen/deutsche-verteidigungspolitik/199277/kalter-krieg)"".

&gt; We are no-where near where we were during the cold war, that should be obvious.

I'd suggest you look up Manifest Destiny, Andrew Jackson, and the wars we raged on the natives. We enslaved them as well, and when they died off we started bringing in Africans to replace them.

Do you honestly believe this justifies slavery, never mind the fact that the Trans-Atlantic Trade affected far more people than some warring tribes in the Americas did?

Before the last fiery hearth that is ablaze within my homeland is extinguished.
For that is the star of my people, and it will forever shine;
It is mine; and solely belongs to my valiant nation.
Frown not, I beseech you, oh thou coy crescent!
Smile upon my heroic nation! Why the anger, why the rage?
Our blood which we shed for you shall not be worthy otherwise;
For freedom is the absolute right of my God-worshipping nation!
I have been free since the beginning and forever shall be so.
What madman shall put me in chains! I defy the very idea!
I'm like the roaring flood; trampling my banks and overcoming my body,
I'll tear apart mountains, exceed the Expanses and still gush out!
The horizons of the West may be bound with walls of steel,
But my borders are guarded by the mighty bosom of a believer.
Bellow out, do not be afraid! And think: how can this fiery faith ever be extinguished,
By that battered, single-fanged monster you call ""civilization""?
My friend! Leave not my homeland to the hands of villainous men!
Render your chest as armour and your body as bulwark! Halt this disgraceful assault!
For soon shall come the joyous days of divine promise;
Who knows? Perhaps tomorrow? Perhaps even sooner!
View not the soil you tread on as mere earth - recognize it!
And think about the shroud less thousands who lie so nobly beneath you.
You're the glorious son of a martyr - take shame, grieve not your ancestors!
Unhand not, even when you're promised worlds, this heavenly homeland.
Who would not sacrifice their life for this paradise of a country?
Martyrs would burst forth should one simply squeeze the soil! Martyrs!
May God take my life, my loved ones, and all possessions from me if He will,
But let Him not deprive me of my one true homeland in the world.
Oh glorious God, the sole wish of my pain-stricken heart is that,
No heathen's hand should ever touch the bosom of my sacred Temples.
These adhans and their testimonies are the foundations of my religion,
And may their noble sound prevail thunderously across my eternal homeland.
For only then, shall my fatigued tombstone, if there is one, prostrate a thousand times in ecstasy,
And tears of blood shall, oh Lord, spill out from my every wound,
And my lifeless body shall burst forth from the earth like an eternal spirit,
Perhaps only then, shall I peacefully ascend and at long last reach the heavens.
So ripple and wave like the bright dawning sky, oh thou glorious crescent,
So that our every last drop of blood may finally be blessed and worthy!
Neither you nor my kin shall ever be extinguished!

China is the same way, the economy only picked up after Mao died in 1976 and the Chinese government began decollectivization in 1978. Followed by shrinking government intervention in the 80s, and large scale privatization in the 90s when almost all large state enterprises were liquidated.

&gt;Every death under capitalism is the result of capitalism.

&gt;Which is a good achievement considering the global population only reached 2 billion in 1927.

&gt;Like seriously? 500,000 malaria deaths annually because of capitalism? You really want to compare todays diseases to that of 1917-1991 you retard? Fucking hell you tankies are delusional.

&gt;How many lives has capitalism saved, anyway? If all deaths under capitalism can be blamed for it, surely all lives it has saved has to be added in? Lets name a few, shall we?

&gt;Alexander Fleming, UK/Scotland, discovered peniccillin which has alone saved 80-200 million people. That is one man. Surely you give capitalism credit for that one ye?

It was inaugurated on August 6, 1966, and a train platform was added in 1999. It was built by the American Bridge Company which constructed the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge.

Upon completion, the bridge had the longest suspended span and the longest main span (1012.88 m) in Continental Europe, the world's longest continuous truss (2277.64 m), and the world's deepest bridge foundation (79.3 m). It was the fifth-largest suspension bridge in the world, the largest outside the US. Today it is the 27th largest suspension bridge in the world.

&gt;separatism = secessionism =/= autonomy

You still don't believe me? Ok, I will provide you with some sources this time.

[Check this out.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_separatist_movements_in_Europe)

[And this.](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Separatist+movement)

Separatism is separating a thing from another thing. For example separating yourself from central rule by becoming autonomous.

&gt; To brzmi jakby odradzanie się narodowości śląskiej było czymś złym, nieprawdaż? Tak samo jak walka o (niepopieraną przez Pana) autonomię. Uznanie języka śląskiego to kwestia polityki, kolejne rządy w Warszawie nie chcą uznania Ślązaków za mniejszość, a jako że dla wielu język = naród (co jest absolutnym bzdetem, wystarczy przytoczyć przykład Austrii, Belgii czy Stanów Zjednoczonych) więc do wprowadzania języka regionalnego nikomu się nie śpieszy.

Już rozumiem o co Panu chodzi, bardzo przepraszam jeżeli było to obraźliwe. Odradzania się narodowości śląskiej nigdy nie nazwałbym czymś złym, ale mam nadzieję, że nie odejdziecie od nas i nie założycie nowego państwa \ s ;)

I faktem jest, że język =/= naród, ale nie zmienia to tego jak jest ważny. Przypomina mi się świetny cytat rumunśkiego filozofa - Emila Ciorana, który to oddaje:

""It is no nation that we inhabit, but a language. Make no mistake; our native tongue is our true fatherland.""

Tunisia experienced an increase in emigration following independence in the late 1950’s; Europe, in particular France, was the destination for numerous Tunisian migrants. 

In fact, between the 1970’s and the 1980’s, Tunisia demonstrated comparatively impressive progress
in relation to human rights and democratic advancement. In 1977, the UNHCR was primarily concerned with refugees in sub-Saharan Africa; Namibia, Zimbabwe (Southern Rhodesia), Zaire and Ethiopia. In relation to North Africa, Egypt was the primary concern, however additional assistance was provided to Algeria. In 1977 Tunisia was not considered problematic in terms of refugees. 

In the 1970’s Italy became notable importer of labour, particularly from North Africa; a series of bilateral trade agreements between Europe and Tunisia facilitated migration to Europe. In fact, the number of Tunisian migrants arriving in Italy attracted criticism from several European countries.

5364,"What's capped at 30 days? I'm sorry, but you are not being clear at all. I assume you are referring to the fact that, under YouTube's Content ID rules, when a user disputes a claim against them, the copyright owner will be notified and they'll have 30 days to respond. There are a number of problems here.

First of all, this is just YouTube's system. It is not a guarantee built into Article 13. 

Secondly, this is actually pretty appauling protection for the user. It means that the user can be deprived of revenue for an entire month simply because somebody decided to invoke copyright against them. In the fast-paced world of the internet, this can be the difference between survival and annihilation for small businesses. 

Finally and most importantly, if the 'copyright owner' persists in their claim, there is nothing the user can do except take the matter to court. This is crucial in cases of exceptions and limitations to copyright or otherwise delicate disputes. The ultimate result is a bias in favour of the person making the complaint: once they make a claim, the content will come down permanently, unless user is ready to fight for it in court. Your average user (including your average small content creator) is simply pushed out in the face of large multinational conglomorates (like Sony) and right-holders' associations. 

There are numerous cases of content creators facing an uphill battle defending their content against constant copyright claims. Passion of the Nerd, who makes detailed and thoughtful critique of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer series, is a good example. He had a video a while back documenting his difficulties. 

&gt; Sony may have a case when their Bach recordings get infringed.

I'm sorry, but I fail to see how that could possibly be the case here, unless you are claiming that the pianist is lying and did not upload their own recordings. What you perhaps mean is that Sony likely does own recordings of Bach of their own, which they are entitled to protect. This is true, but beside the point, which is rather about whether filtering is capable of distinguishing between different recordings of the same public domain musical work. It is not. As a result, if we allow Sony to use filtering as a means of enforcing their related rights in their sound recordings, we are advantaging them at the expense of every other person playing Bach. 

&gt; I certainly don't claim to be an expert 

Not to put too fine a point on it, but just so we're clear here, I teach copyright law at university. You are right that there are a lot of misunderstandings flying about. This is a complicated topic and there is no reason to expect people to have a strong grasp of all the ins and outs of the relevant law.

I'm sorry but this type of argument sucks, it's not really about the piece of paper but recognition and validation. Any kind of recognition of partnerships can greatly improve things for someone that is gay. 

&amp;#x200B;

I spent half of my childhood in Mexico and the other half in Romania and I can tell you that hearing my middle school teachers say things like ""being gay is a mental illness"" really took a toll on me. I'm pretty sure that these things still happen and I'm also pretty sure that if there was more recognition state-wise it would be unacceptable for teachers to say that stuff.

I love Romania from the bottom of my heart but sometimes I wish I never moved here because of how hard it was for me to come to terms with my sexuality. I'm still not okay, every time I go to Mexico I'm shocked to realise that there are straight people that are more comfortable than I am about homosexuality in general. Also, if you ever log into any kind of gay dating app in Romania you will realize that 90% of the people on them are insanely secretive and have some really troubling ways to deal with their sexuality and way too many people live double lives.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, people won't beat you up on the streets are I'm pretty sure there are less hate crimes than in the US or other countries where you've got plenty of state-side recognition, but that doesn't mean that most gay people in Romania aren't having super miserable lives when it comes to this.

Let me give you an active example since Germany faces no active or likely military threat.

Go south a bit into Cyprus. They are exploring gas fields worth billions in their sovereign waters. They have contracted american company Exxon Mobil to take out the gas. Turkey has shown muscle trying to lay claim to Cypriot gas reserves based on the illegal occupation of North Cyprus by Turkey. They harass and send warships to deter this mining of Cypriot sovreign Gas.

So.. america sends their warships, and maintians a military presence.

america does more for EU countries, than the EU itself which is a joke in unity and protecting its own resources. 

The EU is a figment of the imagination at times. It is the USA who stabilises the world.. So yes, the American government is right to complain in military under utilisation by the EU. And frankly closing their eyes and pleading ignorance to the EU's defense.

Exxon Mobile.. Which has a LEGAL contract with Cyprus, to mine in internationally acknowledged sovereign Cypriot waters... Must rely on American war ships and american presence... To mine gas that belongs to Cyprus (And by default the Eurozone).. And yet... It is American troops protecting these interests.. Not Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets take a small hypothetical situation. You are a comic author. You loved Marvel growing up, they inspired your work. You don't live from your hobby yet, you just have a small comic website where you post your original story, of course you have cameos all the time, because you love Marvel characters, and at this point, hundreds of super heroes exist already. 

Now you would like to get to the next step. You saved up a little on the side and met a publisher to release your first comic book. He loves it, the story is inspired, there is a market, the few people who proof read loved it. You go on the publishing but a week after release you learn that Marvel found the 3 support character are too close to their own. 

How do you fight a multi billion company as an independent author ? 

Your comic book isn't hurting them, it's not taking money from them. It just resemble their work too much.

This for decades. Decades after the author *died.*

5479,"I will repost from another thread;

The Swedish media complain about the influx of fake news, though after having a monopoly on the narrative for so long they failed to report (at worst)the truth regarding immigration or at least (at best) didn't give the opposing view the time of day. Immigration is a net negative for almost every social metric you can think of in that country(GDPpc, Crime, % on welfare, school achievement) . Though you wouldn't think as such from reading the Swedish press.

Take the recent rape statistic controversy[(Link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/99dn42/new_analysis_of_rape_sentences_58_percent_of/e4mttp5/?context=3), the statistics came out and where widely reported on, but this mostly seems like a false appeal to neutrality from the Swedish press, a bit of a 'look we aren't biased' yest the narrative that surrounded the release of those facts served to obfuscate them into confusion and or outright dismiss them. For example;

There where two narratives that could have been followed that are both true;

1. Foreigners are seriously over represented in rape statistics; however it could be even worse if you account for the fact that most of the Swedish born convicted rapists are likely 2nd Gen.
2. That these statistics where inconclusive due to low conviction rates, and they don't take into account wider context(i.e don't acknowledge that migrants come from 'masculine backgrounds) --the actual issue is nowhere near as bad as these statistics suggest.

The Swedish media overwhelmingly went with second point, as well as bringing 'expert' sociologists on to criticise the data and say it is so bad that it shouldn't have been released(Yes they stated that data pertaining to all convictions, not a cherry picked sample, shouldn't have been released to the public).

Very little of Swedish press even mentioned point #1.

Instead of paying lip service to right leaning beliefs and then going straight back to towing the party line, these state sponsored companies would do well to have some reporters, staff and journalists that **genuinely have right wing views.** In order to ensure both sides are represented. Otherwise you cannot complain when people people who have right leaning beliefs and who are only presented with a very weak version of their conservative world view look to alternative sources of media.

However journalists in mainstream media are ***overwhelmingly*** left leaning as it stands  [(Link, data on journalists is sparce but this is good)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G9QqbfsWh05-tPSB3hERw5b2Y3MnvpozYt0bTVlkd64/edit#slide=id.p)",,/r/europe/comments/9djg1d/one_in_three_news_articles_shared_on_twitter/e5i6apt/,RetardedRon,1536253523

5497,"&gt; You aren't responding to my posts, you're responding to a black-and-white caricature of what you imagine I'm saying. It's scientific fact that genetic variation exists in humans across the globe, and it aligns geographically. 

So what is my argument ? Because you seem to be the one just repeating same shit time after time. 

&gt; It's entirely possible that we could now begin to define and classify these groups, for example along the clusters identified by Rosenberg.

No, it's been a total failure to try that 

&gt; Serre and Pääbo (2004) make a similar claim: The absence of strong continental clustering in the human gene pool is of practical importance. It has recently been claimed that ""the greatest genetic structure that exists in the human population occurs at the racial level"" (Risch et al. 2002). Our results show that this is not the case, and we see no reason to assume that ""races"" represent any units of relevance for understanding human genetic history. 

But let's assume you're right and we follow Rosenberg, this is what they fucking wrote

&gt; Rosenberg stated that their findings ""**should not be taken as evidence of our support of any particular concept of biological race** (...). Genetic differences among human populations derive mainly from gradations in allele frequencies rather than from distinctive 'diagnostic' genotypes.""

So once fucking more you ignore what is staring you in the face. 

&gt; This has not yet been attempted due to the sensitivity of the subject, which is evidently clear in how controversial this thread was and how people are still desperately attempting to obscure and bend the facts even today, even in this comment chain. 

No people studied it and it was a disaster. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genetic_clustering#Criticism

&gt; You seem to attaching far too much importance to this point. Regardless of in-group variation, humanity can still be divided accurately into these groups along genetic lines

No they can't. Because you can't tell me the races. Which is why clustering is a disaster. Sure you can cluster humans in 6 groups. But you can also cluster them in 2 groups. You can also cluster them in 40 groups. And that's the biggest that was tried. You can probably cluster them in 7 billion groups if you like. Now you tell me **why** one group of clustering or ""races"" is better than the other group. Which you don't do. Because it's totally pointless and meaningless.

&gt; I don't disagree with the point being relevant for domestic opinion polls but why would that even make sense if the whole narrative this entire time has been that he elections were rigged anyway? I'm pretty sure Putin would win the election in any case so why take this huge risk?

That is a good point, and I am not sure. 

I would say firstly we have to keep in mind that the Putin regime has done several not entirely rational things recently. For example, de facto annexing part of a European country, which started an entire new wave of international isolation, sanctions, and reputation loss. There is also a longstanding culture of not forgiving secret services defections which might override all else.

Secondly, while Russians elections are interfered with in several ways (eliminating, harassing and blocking opposition, to some extent also vote manipulation), Putin still has a large amount of support. And my guess is he feels like he needs it. There is nothing he fears more than a popular revolt, which can be seen by the fact that the whole turning of the screws started with the 2011 mass protests. And the way to get such support in the current situation Russia is in, is to frame Russia as the victim of Western subversion, and Putin as the guy playing the game everyone plays, just more cleverly, brutally and for the might of Russia.

5772,"You haven't explained anything relevant, nor anything that is wrong with my comment.

I'm replying to you based on your original comment. I have adequately explained to you how the power delivery is so drastically different on a EV that your ""402hp is unnecessary"" comment doesn't make sense in relation to other cars. With combustion engines you make a bigger, thirstier and much more expensive engine to achieve higher horsepower. EVs don't really have as much range reduction from adding more power, so making a 200hp Tesla wouldn't really achieve much, it'd be similar to putting under-clocked server processors into a regular computer.

&gt;You have 2 persons, one weak person and one strong person. The weak person has a long wrenge (torque), the strong person has a short wrenge. Both produce the same amount of power on the bolt and are able to untie the bolt (carry the trailer) as they're both able to produce identical power (HP) on the bolt, even though the weak person has a longer wrenge.

This doesn't happen in real life. Your motor can theoretically produce as much power as there's fuel and air coming in, but this doesn't happen from the get go, because it's an engine that needs to fire up all the parts. That's why you have to rely on a torque curve. An electric is not an engine and there's very little resistance to access it's potential at any time. 

&gt;The end product being your ability to move x kg in Y seconds over a distance of Z meters and that is horsepower.

What you don't understand is that your X-trail produces 163hp only at the optimal gearing and rpm. It does not produce 163hp in 1st gear, and some of this theory you have explained yourself but I'm not sure you understand what you wrote because you bake in a lot of false assumptions, primarily the one I've tried to tackle in the last couple replies. To put into perspective, a Formula 1 car is rated at close to 1000hp at max, but there's no way you could get it moving with a boat trailer behind it. But if it was in motion already, that's a different story because then it would have more power accessible to produce more torque.

Loaned from elsewhere on Reddit:

&gt;Spiderman and the Hulk are at the edge of a football field with a bunch of rocks.

&gt;Spiderman maxes out with 500lb rocks, but he only takes 20 seconds to move them from one side of the field to the other and get back to the start.

&gt;The hulk can move 800lb rocks, but he takes 40 seconds to move it to the other side and get back.

&gt;So in 2 minutes that means that spiderman moves 3000lbs of rocks while the hulk moves 2400lbs of rocks.

&gt;The hulk has more torque because he can lift more at once, but spiderman does more work over time which means more horsepower.

Hear me out:   Martin Luther spent his life trying to convert Jews over to Christianity, then when it didn't work he got angry and wrote a book called ""Jews and their lies"" in which he calls for all good Christians to kill Jews and burn down their schools and synagogues.

With the rise of Nazism in Germany, this book because highly influential.  A good example is that at the start of WW2, a man went to Nazi Germany and liked what he saw and how Germans treated Jews, and saw the influence of Martin Luther so much so that he then **renamed himself and his son** to Martin Luther King, and Martin Luther King Jr.

5839,"&gt; but Youtube can't exactly hire thousands of employees just to manually deal with copyright infringement claims.

Are you seriously - seriously? - arguing that YouTube shouldn't obey the law because it's too expensive?

Also - that's bullshit.  

[Google claims](https://youtube.googleblog.com/2016/09/why-flagging-matters.html) that YouTube flagged 90 million videos in ten years.  How much would it cost to have a person look at each of those?  If you hire someone at $40 an hour - which is a really really generous rate - and they can evaluate 4 videos an hour - which is really really slow - that would have cost less than $100 million a year - a small fraction of Google's revenue.  

&gt; Automated content ID flags false positives all the time, 

And you are claiming that should be _our_ problem, not YouTube's.  Why is this?  It's _their_ software that is giving wrong results.  They have the money to do it right - they just don't _want_ to.

---

EDIT: Given that Google's system claims to be extremely accurate, even cheaper than manual screening would simply to give everyone who got a false takedown $100.  For example, if Google's system is 95% accurate, then this system would have cost less $50 million a year - if it were 99% accurate, it would have cost less than $10 million.

One good reason that they would never do this is that it's quite likely that the accuracy is less than expect (they don't give actual numbers either) - that their system has a fairly large number of false positives but most people don't dispute because they just don't really care very much...

Errors are inevitable in any system.  However, absent any significant financial pressure on Google (and everyone else) to make false positives significantly costly for them, they will necessarily be leaning towards making those sorts of errors...

EDIT 2: These numbers are significantly too low as has been pointed out, but the point remains.  Even a $10 fee for each false accusation would be affordable for Google and ""incentivize"" them to do a better job.
