By the way you write and your passion for anti America I assume that you’re Chinese and let me tell you this; the world doesn’t hate you, the world hates your government.

GDP per capita in Vaslui (2017): €4.466
GDP per capita of Chisinau (2017): €4.440

So, the capital of Moldova, a city of 700.000 people, the freaking “economic powerhouse” of Moldova, has a lower per capita GDP than the crime &amp; poverty capital of Romania, great comparison. 

&gt;	There still isn’t a highway that connects Bucharest to the second largest Romanian city. Mostly because that city is in Moldova.

Sorry, but please remind me, how many kms of highway does Moldova have? 

Also, Iasi is not the second largest city in Romania, not that it would matter anyway, as there are different priorities when deciding where to build the next highway. Bucharest is not yet connected to next two richest cities (Cluj-Napoca and Timisoara), nor to the European highway network, and I would say that is a much higher priority than connecting to Iasi.",,/r/europe/comments/hork5q/moldova_is_no_longer_the_poorest_country_in_europe/fxn2qry/,crocodilau,1594458013

266,"Before I say anything let me say the police were extremely violently beating people last night, and there are now reports one young man has been beaten to death. No information in the media as of yet, but surprisingly that person is nowhere to be found, and the beating was captured on camera. It was absolutely brutal – 10-12 heavy-gear cops kicking and stomping on a body, with the action obscured by a colonnade of the building of the Ministerial Assembly. It's not hard to imagine how a person can die this way. 

I don't think the other folks in here provided sufficient details, so let me give it a try.

DPS – a so-called liberal party – has been the Éminence grise of every government for over 15 years now. They are the power behind Delyan Peevski – a 30-somethin major media mogul, basically the Bulgarian version of a Columbian drug lord, only without the cocaine.

National Security has been guarding the ex-chairman and current “honorable leader” of DPS Ahmed Dogan, as well as Peevski, the security of both of which can hardly be described as “national”. When an opposition member tried to disembark on the beach next to Dogan’s huge (and illegal) residence, national security illegally stopped him and forced him to go back to his boat. It's important to note that according to the Constitution, all Bulgarian beaches are heavily regulated and are public property.

This sparked the initial protest. The President Rumen Radev gave a very strongly-worded speech how the government is failing, and how attempts to put blame on him about the unlawful protection of party members is moot, given that he was stripped of all powers relating to the oversight of the National Security Agency. 

Enter Geshev, the Chief Public Prosecutor, the jurisdictional baton of DPS, a person so corrupt it is beyond the scope of this comment to even give examples. For several months now he's been trying to “get to” the president, even calling for the Constitution to be amended in order to remove the Constitution-given immunity of the presidential institution. As a punishment for Radev’s speech, the prosecutor arrested several of his closest professionals, including *the personal Secretary of the President*, and charged them with treason... for sharing news online that were already published in the media. I kid you not. They are charged with treason for sharing over private messages online the equivalent of a news article published in the BBC, Deutsche Welle, or Reuters. 

This is a very simplified version of all the reasons people are protesting, but it gives at least some idea to the level of shameless disregard for the law as Bulgaria transmissions towards a soft dictatorship. People are, of course, angry for many, many different reasons, and they shouldn't be simplified to “prosecutor tries to arrest president”. But there is only so much I can describe without needing a graph illustrating all the ties between all the oligarchs and people in power in my country.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/hoym21/just_came_home_from_a_massive_antigovernment/fxmhp9k/,AvalancheMaster,1594451535

361,"The  Srebrenica genocide was the July 1995 massacre of more than 8,000  Bosniaks, mainly men and boys, in and around the town of Srebrenica  during the Bosnian War.

The  killings were perpetrated by units of the Bosnian Serb Army of Republika  Srpska (VRS) under the command of Ratko Mladić. The Scorpions, a  paramilitary unit from Serbia, who had been part of the Serbian Interior  Ministry until 1991, also participated in the massacre. In April 1993  the United Nations (UN) had declared the besieged enclave of  Srebrenica—in the Drina Valley of northeastern Bosnia—a ""safe area""  under UN protection. However, the UN failed to both demilitarise the  Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) within Srebrenica  and force the withdrawal of the VRS surrounding Srebrenica. UNPROFOR's  370 Dutchbat soldiers in Srebrenica did not prevent the town's capture  by the VRS—nor the subsequent massacre.

In  2004, in a unanimous ruling on the case of Prosecutor v. Krstić, the  Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former  Yugoslavia (ICTY), located in The Hague, ruled that the massacre of the  enclave's male inhabitants constituted genocide, a crime under  international law. The ruling was also upheld by the International Court  of Justice (ICJ) in 2007. The forcible transfer and abuse, of between  25,000 and 30,000 Bosniak women, children and elderly which accompanied  the massacre was found to constitute genocide, when accompanied with the  killings and separation of the men.

In  2005, Kofi Annan, then Secretary-General of the United Nations  described the mass murder as the worst crime on European soil since the  Second World War, and in a message to the tenth anniversary  commemoration of the massacre, he wrote that, while blame lay ""first and  foremost with those who planned and carried out the massacre and those  who assisted and harboured them"", the UN had ""made serious errors of  judgement, rooted in a philosophy of impartiality"", describing  Srebrenica as a tragedy that would haunt the history of the UN forever.

In  2006, in the Bosnian Genocide case held before the International Court  of Justice, Serbia and Montenegro was cleared of direct responsibility  for, or complicity in, the massacre, but was found responsible for not  doing enough to prevent the genocide and not prosecuting those  responsible, in breach of the Genocide Convention. The Preliminary List  of People Missing or Killed in Srebrenica compiled by the Bosnian  Federal Commission of Missing Persons contains 8,373 names. As of July  2012, 6,838 genocide victims have been identified through DNA analysis  of body parts recovered from mass graves; as of July 2019, 6,610 victims  have been buried at the Memorial Centre of Potočari.

In  April 2013, Serbian President Tomislav Nikolić officially apologised  for the massacre, although he stopped short of calling it genocide. In  2013 and 2014, the Netherlands was found liable in its own supreme court  and in the Hague district court of failing in its duty to prevent more  than 300 of the deaths.

On 8 July  2015, Russia, at the request of the Republika Srpska and Serbia, vetoed a  UN resolution condemning the Srebrenica massacre as genocide. Serbia  called the resolution ""anti-Serb"", while European and U.S. governments  affirmed that the crimes were genocide. On 9 July 2015, both the  European Parliament (EP) and the U.S. Congress adopted resolutions  reaffirming the description of the crime as genocide.

On  22 November 2017, Ratko Mladić was convicted of various crimes at the  United Nations' tribunal, including genocide for his role at Srebrenica.  He was sentenced to life imprisonment. The judgement is currently under  appeal.

On 24 March 2016, Radovan  Karadžić, the former president of the Republic of Srpska was found  guilty of the genocide in Srebrenica, war crimes, and crimes against  humanity, 10 of the 11 charges in total, and sentenced to 40 years'  imprisonment. On 22 July 2016 he filed an appeal against his conviction.  The appeal was rejected on 20 March 2019, and the sentence was  increased to life imprisonment.

The Al-Aqsa mosque is the 3rd holiest site of Islam and considered to be where Muhammad went to heaven. There was a short period of time according to Muslims where Muhammad and his followers prayed in the direction of that mosque.

If that would ever happen, terrorism against Israel would increase by multiple orders of magnitude. Fringe Imams call for holy war against Israel today, in this case it would undoubtedly become a mainstream sentiment.

Muslims don't play that type of shit, and millions and millions of them would rather die right now than see that happen. It'd be like Israel collectively murdered every muslim's mother. I'm not joking and if anything I'm understating the level of chaos that would cause.

Sunlight at low angles is unusable. Sunlight perpendicular to earth is the most optimal. the efficiency drops drastically with change in angle. That's why near the equator the solar panels will always produce more sunlight over the course of the year, despite having the total day hours pretty much the same (because sun shines more at the high angles). Also, there is the fact there are mountains and peaks in Sweden and Norway, making sunligh even more unusable.

There are only 3 parties in opposition that has a chance, and one is chp, which always looked like its on the left, but always acted more conservative and oppresive than everyone else. They were the ones to force headscarve bans for instance. And they tried to prevent govt. From giving kurds their rights. In a million years, you wont see me voting for them. 

Second option, hdp, looks like far left almost, and their policies are in line with that, except one thing, they are kurdish nationalists who doesnt even say that pkk is a terrorist organisatiom. Their ultimate goal is to set up a marxist-leninist country in south eastern turkey. Howevet kurds are everywhere in turkey and biggest kurdish population is on istanbul. Soo, good luck to them, but not gonna get my vote.

Third option is iyi parti, a nationalist fraction from the nationalist mhp(partner of akp in govt). Their policies are a little complicated and one might say confusing as well. They were all in a pact against ruling parties but as you would expect, they hate hdp as a turkish nationalist party and like I said, they dont have a clear policy since they cant disagree with coalition, but also dont really agree with them. So I dont know their policies. So I wont vote for them as well. 

You are saying erdoğans foreign policy is not a good one. However, he is trying to get turkeys economic rights on east mediterranean. He has an idea about whats going around him. You may not like it, but that refugee threat was not for no reason. Eu promised money to turkey in order too keep them awat but did not even give a tenth of the money so he did that. You being european might think it was wrong, but imo it was pretty fucking wrong and dumb as well for you to not only keep the money, but also you scolded us for our operations in syria! Every one of these parties except hdp was very happy to see refugees going btw. Just so you know. 

And another thing, all the opposition ever says about foreign policy is “why are we in syria, why are we in libya” thats all they come up with. Thats not a policy.

Erdogans foreign policy has harmed the country in so many ways, Sanctions from the US in 2016 because of Erdogan hit the economy hard. All he does is antagonize western powers who have far larger economies and in return they just stop trading or break-down relationships with Turkey. He has basically made an enemy out of Russia, the EU, the US, India, Israel and China. 

But dont worry Erdogan has made super good friendships with the likes of Pakistan which worships him as the leader of islam! isn't that great? and calling for a new ottoman empire has reached the top of the list while calling Ataturk a british agent and a shaitan against Islam.

The architectural contest for the Palace of the Soviets (1931–1933) was won by Boris Iofan's neoclassical concept, subsequently revised by Iofan, Vladimir Shchuko and Vladimir Gelfreikh into a skyscraper. If built, it would have become the world's tallest structure of its time. 

Construction started in 1937, and was terminated by the German invasion in 1941. In 1941–1942, its steel frame was disassembled for use in fortifications and bridges. Construction was never resumed. In 1958, the foundations of the Palace were converted into what would become the world's largest open-air swimming pool, the Moskva Pool. 

In 2000 Cathedral of Christ the Saviour was rebuilt on its original spot.

What, lol. Up until this point u were somewhat right. Religion is tribalism too.

But here u had to lol. Muslims weren't at their lowest lmao.

Ataturk wanted to forge the Turkish nation and one way was to remove Islamic influence. Islam is essentially an Arab religion. It's adherents, dress, talk and behave like ancient Arabs.

Ata turk even wanted to replace the Islamic call to prayer, which is even now world wide in Arabic, with Turkish. He was a true nationalist. He even closed down a lot of mosques and wanted to modernize turkey. Make it more modern.

The Hagia Sophia being turned into a mosque was part of that policy lmao. 

&gt;The muslims have come a long way from that period of weakness. So, for them, this decision is elecrifying. Its a symbol of them slowly becoming strong and independent again. They are no longer sub-subservient to the ""christian"" west.

Yeah sure. If you think so.

Dododream, arguably NL is not enough of a tax haven.

For instance, Unilever is now leaving NL for the UK, since the UK requires less tax than NL. You can think a lot about this, but I think you will agree we would much rather have kept Unilever.

Also, Boeing is paying full tax in the USA, but for some reason get gifts from the government in order to stay economically viable against other non-USA companies like Airbus. In practice they get back more than they pay in tax \[following 2017 numbers\].

So if you want a true, free market, then clearly tax havens are bad.

Because people had been gunned down for practicing their faith.

&gt; Because it happened on your turf and our turf. Not a tough thing to understand. There is a national feeling of responsibility when these things happen in your backyard.

Really? I mean no offence, but it should be well known that France (and the UK, and some other countries) are really identical to the USA in this sort of thing. The USA gets more attention than the rest because it's the biggest, but if you dig for it, you can find examples of France's government overthrowing governments in Africa (and everything else that comes with the *Francafrique* ordeal)

e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sankara

&gt;On 15 October 1987, Sankara was killed by an armed group with twelve other officials in a coup d'état organized by his former colleague Blaise Compaoré. When accounting for his overthrow, Compaoré stated that Sankara jeopardized foreign relations with former colonial power France and neighbouring Ivory Coast, and accused his former comrade of plotting to assassinate opponents.[1]

926,"&gt; Rome sent educated, literate bishops to the royal courts of newly converted kingdoms to advise and educate kings

To ""be good christians"" not to manage agricultural affairs and tax returns.

&gt;the pope conferred legitimacy to monarchs, which drove forward the creation of larger, more powerful kingdoms

Considering the anti-popes and wars with surrounding powers, the pope couldn't offer legitimacy to himself. It was largely force of arms and traditional custom like salic law which did most of the work. 

As for ""divine right of kings"", that's far older than Christianity.

&gt;Mediation by Rome in disputes

Tis is pretty much the only time you have a genuine point.

&gt;Administrative role of local churches (diocese) e.g. recording births and deaths

Yay for parish registers.

&gt;The role of monks in recording history (see Bede) and copying and preserving texts (important for codifying and standardising language)

Thank fuck for Western Europe's low literacy rates otherwise this point might never be made. Suddenly monks become heroes while scrapping old philosophical pagan texts to re-use pages for prayer books.

&gt;Monogamy

Are you serious?

Yeah, the church which was against the concept of marriage altogether is responsible for the Roman traditional marriage and the concept of monogomy. Seriously?

Do you not know anything about the Church before it was left to legitimize whatever warlord set roots in Western Europe as the last remaining standing institution, by virtue of popular demand?

When Denmark produces too much electricity from wind, they need to get rid of it at all cost. Worst case scenario, they have to pay to get rid of the excess (it is vital for the stability of the grid). Best case scenario, they ""sell"" it to Norway who buy it at the marginal price of producing electricity from hydro (nearly nothing). Norway then store this excess electricity using pumped hydro.

When Denmark has too little electricity, they pay Norway - this time a hefty sum because it's peak electricity - to get some electricity from Norway's hydro installations, possibly the same electricity that they sold to Norway for nothing earlier on.

In this way, Denmark is highly hydro-dependant, in that without Norway's hydro, they're fucked.

&gt; What's the difference between the people who drown on the Libyan coast and those who starve in Africa or are killed in a laogai?

Assuming it's international waters, those people can be saved without violating the sovereignty of countries. To engage in wars and to stop ongoing conflicts, we need a UN mandate. That has been ignored from time to time, but that's a different story. It costs us no violation of other international law to throw a life ring to someone who's drowning, but to bomb ISIS, we need to drop bombs on a country that doesn't want us to.

If we want to stop the Uighur genocide, we'd need to attack China or achieve that via diplomatic channels. Quite a different story.

Proper mask usage is not trivial and the efficacy for simple cotton masks is far from proven. Used properly it definitely helps, but I think the consensus here is that other changes in behaviour are easier to implement and more effective. If people work from home they not only avoid infections at work but also do not have to take a subway ride where they need masks for protection.

No it wasn't. All it did it took the problem (theoretically) from Italy and Grece and moved it to whole EU, which could probably handle 10 times more ""refugees"" than Italy. However:  

Depending on your definition of ""refugee""  
1. if we consider only first safe country, most of them aren't refugees in Italy and don't qualify.  
2. If they are refugees (which means having war in your country grants you a licence to select any country you want and go there) then even EU's capacity isn't enough, it will only delay the problem, make it bigger, but we would still end up in a similar situation.

Religion, be it Christianity in Europe, or Judaism, and Islam in the middle east and africa, or Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism, etc in Asia all had various roles in shaping and preserving their respective societies. 

I think christianity and religion is a fairly neutral force myself. Its just a reflection of humanity.

1642,"&gt; I keep seeing this bullshit argument against solar and EVs, but oddly nobody talks about the extraction cost of coal, uranium, oil, gas, or the resources required to build a mega-dam or nuclear facility.

I'm not sure about fossil fuels, but as far as nuclear is concerned, it's several orders of magnitude less material-intensive. 

[These are the amount of raw materials needed for several sources of energy, fuel excluded](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EGf33VKWoAA0re-?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900).

And [fuel included](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dqstg1YX4AE0zdn?format=jpg&amp;name=medium).

Unfortunately, I don't have the numbers at hand for fossil fuel plants with fuel included. But we do have it for nuclear in the second graphic. We can see that, fuel included, hydro, wind and solar PV are about two orders of magnitude more intensive than nuke. 

Solar is also more resource-intensive than hydro, while wind is less resource-intensive. But hydro is dispatchable, so to make a fair comparison you'd have to take into account the resources needed to make wind/solar dispatchable too.  
This will heavily depend on the technology used... lithium batteries are likely going to be worse than, say, water electrolisys for hydrogen - currently the most used technology to make wind/solar dispatchable, ironically, is... pumped hydro.

Okay, your entire claim never happened and it was another lie. I never said what you claimed I did. 

&gt; Opposing the EU automatically makes you far-right?

The list is there for a reason. Examing any single item in isolation needn't be sufficient, although it can be.

&gt; Saying that Spain should blockade Gibraltar doesn't count as a militaristic threat?

It isn't if E.U. law and courts don't exist in your delusions. Besides, this is another tu quoque.

&gt; I like how being ""imperialist"" is somehow a uniquely a British trait, as if no other European nations had empires of their own.

Yet another tu quoque.

&gt; That was a sentence, not a speech!

It's a sentence as part of a speech. You need the entire speech. Go buy the movie.

&gt; Tens of millions of Americans suffer food poisoning and die every year from consuming chlorinated chicken, how could I not have known...

This reductive nonsense exemplifies how you know nothing and are incurious to boot. You've failed to do any research and you think this is solely about how effective chlorine is and/or whether or not its unhealthy in residue.

&gt; The EU ban on chlorinated chicken exists more as a form of economic protectionism than to protect health and safety. 

Again, ample evidence you don't know what you're talking about. The ban applies internally as well. Read farm to fork.

&gt; The EU is incredibly protectionist and spits in the face of the principle of free trade.

The United States and U.K. are predatory capitalist, monopolist, thieves of ideas, imperalist exploiters who are a threat to democracy, freedom, law and order, health, environment and social wellbeing.

&gt; It's a non-issue that remainers latched on to as proof that Brexit was going to be a catastrophe.

It already is a catastrophe. Johnson is attempting to lure in 10,000 seasonal workers because Brexit as well as the hatred and bigotry it has engendered has chased all the immigrant labourers away. And:

&gt; (...) it’s not just fruit &amp; veg. In a modern, mobile world, our seasonal labour crisis is also resulting in shortages in regional distribution centres and manufacturing and processing facilities that are gearing up for Christmas.

&gt; Coupled with the perilous state of dairy processors, trouble is also brewing on Britain’s farms. On the meat side, too, Brexit threatens British farmers: potential trade deals with the US and Brazil could wipe them out. That’s the irony of Brexit. It was supposed to take back control. The result could be the total opposite.

Secondly, that and other dinner choices perfectly describe what an absolutely mental, pathologically narcissist swine he is: he must outdo his guests in every respect, even something as insignificant as an ice cream scoop.

1697,"Sweden broke the 50% mark on renewable back in 2012. They just rely on hydro much more so than wind. They also still got a few nuclear plants and they are going for 100% renewables by 2040.

The problem with this map is that you see the percentages and assume thats all renewable sources there, but its only tracking wind and solar, and we have countries like Norway, Sweden not to mention Iceland, that just dont rely as much on these. So sure Denmark beats all 3 on wind energy - but its got less renewable overall than all 3 of those countries. So thats something to keep in mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Im actually not 100% but I believe Iceland is almost fully renewable energy already, between hydro and geothermal.

&gt;Uh, no. It has not. In fact, practically all world leaders, including Churchill, agreed that a unified Europe would be essential to prevent war.

Bullshit, they were talking about an economic common market, not political unity. The idea of a united Europe has always been a fringe crackpot idea that has gained power by using what was formerly known as the EEC as a trojan horse.

1774,"&gt;The fact that your tax is so stupidly low actually means that Ireland too loses out. 

Corperate tax makes up a greater percentage of irelands government revenue than nearly any other European country. Not to mention irelands corperate tax is 12.5% its effective rate for some foreign companies is far lower around 5% but the effective rate in france and most of europe is also only like 10%. Its not like irelands tax are all that radically lower than the rest of Europe.

The average corporate tax as percent of tax revenue in the OECD as a whole is 8% in ireland its 17%.


&gt;If you can't see that the only winner in such a competition are the companies and only slightly the country that ""win"" then I'm not sure how to paint it any better. 

Seems to be working out quite well for ireland in 30 years despite a massive recision we went from being as poor as east germany to having some fo the highest wages in europe. This race to the bottom might be hurting other countries but ireland speaks English, has strong ties to the US, isnt landlocked and has EU access wich will always give it the upper hand against anyone else but deleware who tries to race further to the bottom than us. We will always win the race to the bottom and due to are small size we will benefit from it. 

The race to bottom arguement doesn't work when you can win such a race. Ireland is one of the only country's that can win a race like that and still benefit so that narrative doesn't work.

Hungary has lower tax rate than ireland but fails to succeed as tax haven like ireland because of the advantages outside of tax rate ireland has.

&gt;I'd definitely be positive towards a minimum corporate tax in the EU. 

The nice or Lisbon agreement was edited in order to pass in Ireland in such a way that it's impossible for the EU to dictate ireland corperate tax. Doesnt matter what you think it's our tax policy not yours and you can't change no matter how much you want to.

1893,"For a bit of context, this is the result of a law made by the far right party the league (it's literally often called Salvini decree) and it basically says that the minister of defence has the power to block any arriving ship for basically any reason.
It's a highly controversial and maybe unconstitutional law that might be changed also because of the intervention of the Italian president Mattarella.
He basically said that the law isn't inherently bad but it's way too broad, it allows the minister of defence to force ONG's break the law of the sea, which explicitly says that you have the OBLIGATION to rescue people and bring them to the nearest SAFE coast if you're in the vicinity of a shipwreck. (By international standards Lybia is not a safe coast)
So it basically means that every ONG (or every ship passing by a shipwreck) in the Mediterranean sea has either the option to break the law of the sea, (an international agreement signed by basically everyone) or the Italian law.
There is a third option though, to not do anything and let drowning people to die, and this law clearly invites you to do exactly that. (Your ship might be seized by the government if you save migrants from dying)

Just another bit of information, the number of immigrants that come into Europe by crossing the Mediterranean is very low nowadays, in 2016, 200'000 migrants landed on Italian coasts, in 2019 it was about 10'000, a manageable number of people who can be welcomed without big inconveniences.
This enormous reduction of immigrants is due to an agreement between the Italy and Lybia but it's complicated and shady (and bad) and I don't want to get in detail.

Every single migrant that was blocked for weeks in the middle of the sea by the Salvini decree was eventually hosted either in Italy or in another European country.

1928,"It has not, in my opinion.

It has shown, rather:

\- That agenda maximization has made compromise difficult. The Italians want things while ignoring Dutch concerns. The Dutch want things while ignoring Spanish concerns. The EU Parliament wants things while ignoring V4 concerns. The V4 want things while ignoring the West's concerns. And none want to compromise more than a little which makes it impossible for other leaders to compromise either.

\- That the EU has problems with rapid decision making, broadly due to the above.

\- That the gaps between viewpoints in Europe are growing, and that Britain leaving has not made the EU more united.

\- That the EU, possibly in a more functional form, is very much needed. Countries such as the US and China are also maximizing their agendas and even the EU struggles to keep a semblance of clout. Individual European countries would be ignored in the future on a world stage in which their economic weight is rapidly dwindling.

\- That the EU needs to have a more strong-armed approach on certain issues. It is ridiculous that it avoids confronting other global players, it fails to step in to defend Cyprus and Greece and it cannot even get African countries to take back their own citizens in repatriation schemes.

The EU needs to be more functional to gain the clout it needs in a time of greater assertivity from other gobal players. But it needs to be able to make a few strategic compromises first. It needs to convince the frugal countries that stimulus IS the right approach to a major crisis while convincing the South that they DO need to reform once things calm down. It needs to strike a compromise on migration, and needs to think outside the box. Something like re-distribution but with an absolute cap on annual admissions and genuine enforcement of deportation orders. It needs to have a common policy on pooling clout when members are threatened. And lastly, it needs to have a more unified foreign policy. Not on every issue, as that will never happen, but on 2-3 key issues that are worth negotiating for in the Council. Stuff like global cooperation on climate, for example.

Germany is run by right-wingers who kowtow to their American counterparts. The German population want them out:

I wanted to correct a typo and a make one term more accurate, and as the three minutes to do so ninja had passed, I deleted the comment and posted the version with the corrections as a new comment. I always do this, I never let a comment of mine stand as edited.

Why?

Because discussions with Turkish ultranationalists on reddit taught me so. To my utmost regret, I had to learn that I am dealing with people who do not share my love for intellectually honest discussion.

I was just saying that without context, the chart doesn't tell us a ton. 

And that goes with what you're saying really. Iceland shows 0% on this chart, but I assume that's because their location makes them focus less on solar/wind and instead on hydroelectric/geothermal. So it's a little lacking in context to throw up a 0% without knowing what a reasonable target for solar/wind would be for them, and what other renewables they're using (and what those sources' targets are).

EDIT: as an American just strolling through here, I'll give an example pertinent to myself. Our solar makes up 2% of our electricity, and the current estimates say that *rooftop* solar alone (so **not** counting solar farms) could get us to 39% of our current electricity usage. So 2% is obviously terrible, but it's more interesting to know how short we are of our theoretical ceiling.

2122,"&gt; Which part do you doubt? Why do you think Germany wouldn't have been able to do the same thing France did? 

Of course, we could have built lots of nuclear plants. The claim, that it would be just as expensive, as our renewable transition until now, is just plain stupid.

&gt; so it probably could have added more reactors to existing plants, which  is easier than building new plants (because the protests against adding  reactors to an existing site are likely to be smaller and less  successful than protests against a new plant). 

You can not simply build another plant to an existing one. A nuclear power plant uses water for cooling and I doubt that the rivers can simply support another plant for that purpose, when they already fail to do so [sometimes](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-electricity-heatwave/hot-weather-cuts-french-german-nuclear-power-output-idUSKCN1UK0HR).

&gt; Here's one source: With Nuclear Instead of Renewables, California &amp; Germany Would Already Have 100% Clean Electricity. It's only a short article, not a lengthy report, but it does contain some numbers. 

That source sucks. Pretty hard. The founder of this fake group is called out [here](https://twitter.com/rahmstorf/status/1278615238779318273?s=20), by a renowned scientists, for his shitty tactics

And the Numbers are completely wrong. Germany did of course not pay 580 Billion Euros for the ""Energiewende""! I can not fathom, how the idiot even gets to the number. There is only some link to a blommsberg article, but those asshats, do also not provide any source.

My own research gives pretty contradicting numbers, depending on how you exactly calculate effects. But I found no source, which says calculates it this high. Two (german) sources even claims, that we made a profit of 300 Billion euro. It's from the DIW, German economy instiitute, literally translated)

And Hinckley Point C, does of course not cost 12.5 Billion Euro! The cost is already at [23](https://twitter.com/rahmstorf/status/1278615238779318273?s=20) Billion Euro!

As if Turkey respects any treaty it signs. The same treaty provided protection to the Istanbul Greek community. Turkey destroyed that community back in 1955 with a nazi inspired [pogrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul_pogrom). From about 120.000 Greeks in Istanbul, less than 2500 remain today.   
The same happened to the Greek population in Imvros and Tenedos islands. According to the treaty you are referring to, [guaranteed a special autonomous administrative status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imbros) for Imbros and Tenedos to accommodate the Greeks.    
Again Turkey managed to drive away the Greek population using jail inmates to attack them.   
Also,  Turkey has its [4 army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegean_Army)right opposite to our islands. How can we not defend our islands? . Do you think anyone trusts Turkey?  Seriously?  what's Turkey's excuse for having an army opposite to our islands? They are afraid of an invasion?

2191,"Article:


Wirecard executive Jan Marsalek touted secret documents about the use of a Russian chemical weapon in the UK, as he bragged of ties to intelligence services to ingratiate himself with London traders.

The documents, which have been reviewed by the Financial Times, included the formula for novichok, the world’s deadliest nerve agent.

His use of the documents in meetings in the summer of 2018, which were described by two traders who attended, show the mysterious connections and bizarre tactics of a man who helped run the German payments group for a decade before it collapsed last month in a fraud scandal.

The German authorities and Wirecard’s lenders are picking through the wreckage of the insolvent group in an attempt to discover what sort of business really took place inside a company with privileged access to global payments networks.

Mr Marsalek disappeared last month in the run-up to Wirecard’s collapse. Before then he had presented himself as an international man of action, using secret documents to forge links with traders in a years-long operation to identify speculators betting against the Wirecard share price.

Documents shown to traders in 2018 and reviewed by the FT included the precise chemical compound for novichok, used in the poisoning of an ex-spy and his daughter in the UK in March of that year.

The classified papers held by Mr Marsalek included details of an investigation by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons into the attack in Salisbury, in which former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned. The British government blamed the attack on two officers from Russia’s GRU military intelligence unit.

The Skripals survived but Dawn Sturgess, a woman in the nearby town of Amesbury, later died after coming into contact with a container of the nerve agent.

Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commander of the UK’s chemical and biological weapons regiment, said: “These documents would be restricted to OPCW member states and should not be in the public domain.”

He added that the documents were “unlikely” to have come from OPCW member states in western Europe or the US.

Three of the documents — all labelled “OPCW Highly Protected” and which ran to 50 pages in total — covered two deployments of OPCW specialists to Britain in April and July 2018, describing how samples of the nerve agent were taken from the victims and distributed to secret OPCW laboratories for testing.

Recommended

They also included a detailed account of Russia’s version of events, which argued that the strain of novichok used in the attack had in fact been manufactured at Porton Down, the British military research facility.

A fourth document seen by the FT was a presentation for a “Briefing to State Parties” held on September 13 that year.

The OPCW, which is based in The Hague, said this week that it was investigating the matter, but declined further comment. The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mr Marsalek, a 40-year-old Austrian who was Wirecard’s chief operating officer until he was fired last month, appears to have gone to ground as the scale of a multiyear accounting fraud at the once high-flying technology company became apparent. 

Immigration records showed that Mr Marsalek boarded a flight to Manila last month before travelling to China from the Philippine city of Cebu.

But, as the Wirecard scandal exploded into full view and the company lurched towards insolvency, Philippine justice secretary Menardo Guevarra told the FT that: “CCTV footage does not show him arriving here, and there is no record of any flight to China scheduled in the morning of June 24 from Cebu.”

Wow a passive aggressive letter! How horrid! Scientology got nothing on your cult. If you were coerced into baptism as an adult then by canon law it is invalid. If it was as a baby then your parents made the choice for you as they do everything else at that age (education, food ect) as you aren't yet at the age of reason. So no I'm not lying you fat sperg, I'm sorry you have paternalist issues. 


&gt; That's a weird excuse for mass murder, genocides and forceful conversion. ""It's all good, Holocaust happened more 70 years ago, no biggie brah, please forget a bout it.""


The question was why do we still tolerate the church in the modern day you stupid fuck, no shit I'm going to talk about the present. That's like saying we should dismantle Germany because of what they did 70 years ago


&gt; Oh look, Catholics only killed like a million, that makes them better than those who killed 2 millions, amirite?
It really is funny how you keep finding excuses for mass murders. No wonder you have to mention communists all the time, you need to pretend there's something worse than you. But make no mistake, both groups belong to the trash of history


State atheism literally killed far more people than the church ever did, seethe harder dumbass lmao. The Catholic church is a massive organization, spanning multiple nations with multiple levels of authority for 2,000 years, if the church ONLY killed like 2 million people, that would literally make it far less worse than any nation state in history. Not to mention I doubt it's even that high since there were far more brutal death cults and religions floating around


&gt;Christianization is worse, way worse. It has managed to conquer the western world and made itself a normality for centuries


AKA it built the western world into the highly developed powerhouse it is today, how horrible ;(


&gt;  witch hunts


That was mainly prots you dumb dumb, pope Gregory VII literally had to force a king to stop killing witches over a bad harvest, and the church proclaimed in 785 infallibly that witchcraft cannot work, and that anyone who killed a witch was to be put to death



&gt; It was responsible for the lack of progress


Imagine still believing the dark ages myth, one that literally even atheist historians say is bullshit


&gt; almost wiping out native Americans


I'm sorry the Spaniards didn't have an advanced knowledge of Germ theory and immunology hundreds of years ago. You realize as soon as a vaccine was available they gave it to the natives too right? 


&gt; an excuse for aristocracy


Unironically based, there is nothing wrong with elitism


&gt; Catholic institutions are abusing children and protecting child abusers


So is hollywood and the porn industry but I bet most atheist soywads won't dare stop watching porn or watching shitty superhero films. Unlike these industries the church actually has complimented reforms in order to reduce sex abuse that have reduced the cases of sex abuse over time. Also you are still more likely statistically to have your kids get raped by a public school teacher than a clergy 
&gt; Excuse me if I find that cult sick, it deserves nothing else


Thank goodness your opinion isn't worth its weight in manure

Looking at history through a lens of current morality is stupid, we would never be done piling shit on ourselves for no apparent reason other then being woke. Looking at the industrial revolution from a current moral compass makes it one giant morally disturbed practice, was this a failure too? The industrial revolution was rife with starving people who had no were to go or any way to take proper care of themselves. Yet at the same time it brought a level of prosperity to humanity in ways we had ever seen before. 

History is bursting with things that we deem reprehensible by today's standards, that is the very reason that we have left these things behind us and not do them anymore. This is the whole idea of history, learning from the past in order to avoid future mistakes. Harping on past 'transgressions' from our current point of view on morality is pointless. All these things that people want acknowledgement for have been acknowledged on numerous occasions, but this doesn't seem to lay it to rest.

While my own party is in the European grouping of ALDE aka RE, and I rarely quote the competition, this statement of the largest group in the EP is just too much to the point to be ignored.

By the way, the international containment against the aggressive foreign policies of Turkey's Erdogan/Bahceli regime is picking up steam on many fronts these days. For example, just in yesterday, [Israel and Greece signed a mutual defence agreement](https://www.ekathimerini.com/254456/article/ekathimerini/news/parliament-approves-defense-agreement-with-israel), and the US decision to include Cyprus in their military training programme [has Turkey fuming](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/turkey-slams-us-military-decision-on-greek-cyprus/1904259).

How many times do I have to tell you that it is completely irrelevant if particular elements of this aggressive ghetto bully style foreign policy of the Erdogan/Bahceli regime are drafted by regime elements that are ideologically close to Sayyid Qutb or by regime elements that are ideologically close to Hitler? The evil is just the same. And Erdogan and Bahceli sell it.

The ""Blue Homeland"" doctrine reads like a verbal copy of the German Nazi regime's spatial expansion doctrines. Even the justification, like the alleged ""chokehold"" by neighbouring states, is the same.

So if we went to 2-3 as an average, that is a 40-60% drop globally.

So in a sense, Europe is already in a reasonably good state. This is actually fantastic news, because it kind of implies that a very good standard of living will be perfectly maintainable with 2-3 tons (that is actually a VERY important message to send). Only problem of course is that Europe is outsourcing some of its CO2 emissions and let China and the gulf countries eat some of our sins to be sure.

Beyond that whole ""import the stuff needing heavy industry"", countries like Sweden and Switzerland are VERY close to maintainable already. It's just very hard to tell what their real footprint is when you include the consumption of Chinese goods... 

... ok I got curious enough to start doing the numbers.

Heres a crude estimate.

China has CO2 production of 7.5 tons/capita. However, if you ignore the ""manufacturing hub of the world"" and just focus on GDP, its peer in Bhutan (both around $10k/cap) has 1.4 tons. Apparently 20% is construction so that's another 1.5 tons.

Yet that leaves 4.6 tons/capita that seem to be for exports.

All of the first world combines for maybe 3/4 of China's population (EU, USA, Japan, Australia, Singapore, Canada etc), which means that we each get 4.6 * 1.33 on top of what we do.

&gt;People there have access to great amounts of fish, they adore cleanliness, and are incredibly well educated; so much so that most people have a very high or at least above average level of language proficiency in english for a non-native.

This part atleast is mostly true, but there's always the exceptions. I find most Swedes do a pretty good job at cleaning up after themselves -  but that doesn't mean you won't find discarded beercans, cigarette stumps, candy wrappers and the like. [Or horrorstories like this popping up.](https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=104&amp;artikel=6953448) occasionally. 

As for fish - yeah, if you enjoy fishing there's practically no place in the country where you're particularly far from a large body of water or if you just want to buy fresh fish to cook I don't think you'll have a hard time finding that anywhere either.
I'd say the level of education is pretty high, English proficiency being high is also true. While the level varies, anyone middleaged or younger should have little to no problems with a casual conversation in English.

They are saying that they were always loyal, that they fulfilled their part of the 'contract' with the Spanish king, that the Dutch are not to blame for all the bad things that happened during and after the conflict that led to their independence. 

""I have always honored the king of Spain"" is what it says. So ""It's not our fault, blame the Spanish"".

Now let's imagine instead the Dutch painted themselves as rebels who rose up against their rightful ruler and illegally seceded from Spain. They would have had a hard time finding good diplomatic relations with the other European nations. They would have turned themselves to political outcasts. Nobody wants to associate with rebel scum if you still want to keep good contact with Spain too. That's not helpful in the long term, the Dutch needed at least the silent approval of the rest of Europe, if not outright support for their independence.

They are actually pretty spread out since the Russian Empire made initiatives to settle Siberia and the Far East which the Soviet Union later continued.

The Russian population is at about 144 million right now, with about 80% self identifying as ethnic Russians.

&gt;Out of the about 170 million population I'd claim that at least 40 million aren't native Russians though. While it's correct the Rus nationalism does exist, after the Putins reform of unlimited terms new movements has risen up especially in the old Siberiatic and Tataric lands. 

I haven't heard much about that, from my understanding Russian nationalism even if not necessarily ""Putin nationalism"" is pretty strong. Even supposed liberals like Navalny won't withdraw support for the Crimean Invasion because of the support they would lose.

Back in 1992, when the first russian-backed separatist state appeared, Transnistria, it was made possible only by Ukraine letting russian soldiers through it's land to make that state a reality. In some places ukrainians even fought along with russians against Republic of Moldova. After the war, Ukraine continued to have great economic relationships with the separatist forces and essentially kept the state alive by supplying it with everything it needed. Ukrainian officials were even the supporters of Moldovan federalisation in 2003, where Transnistria and Gagauzia would have 66% control of all Moldova in legislature and even veto powers on everything (kinda hypocrithical, considering today Ukrainians wouldn't want Ukraine to be federalized, but they did wish that upon Moldova). Even to this day, they still have economic relationships with Transnistria, only thing that changed after 2015 is they finally let Moldovan Customs to perform their activity at the Transnistria - Ukraine borders, but even this is not enough.

It actually helps Sweden because few people cross country. So the spread to their non capital regions took longer than in Denmark.

The Russian aggressions aren't justified in any way but they are partly a product of American influence in Eastern Europe.

2731,"Times have changed. 10 to 15 years ago a common idea Europe was still that China, especially after having left behind communist times (economically) and with increasing wealth, may gradually transform on a societal level and that despite cultural differences a cooperative, more open-minded China could emerge, not least due to the internet. Instead we have seen the rise of mass surveillance techniques, military agression, internet censorship, concentration camps, HK protests, and an increasingly more professionally acting authoritarian, nationalist government. And all this combined with impressive economic growth, such that China's influence in the world is no longer negligible.

This is a major reason why Merkel wanted to make EU-China relations the top topic of the presidency, and she would have had half a year to find common ground within the EU. Noone had ever seriously attempted that. This is also why the comparison with Obama's time does not lead to much insight.

Regarding China as a rival: This is not a black-and-white thing. There are many options on the scale from enemy via rival via competitor to partner, and the approach to dealing with China may well be differ with respect to the field of policy concerned. (We need China as a partner for globally tackling climate change, for example.)

And yet, it is a bit futile to muse about the potential outcome of the original plans for the presidency. Obviously Europe will have to sit together sooner rather than later to find a common answer regarding China. The following years will certainly be crucial. Either because Trump remains president and further catalyses European unity, or because a different US president will be seeking to forge a partnership with the EU with respect to China.",Berlin,/r/europe/comments/hmrvk4/merkel_comes_under_fire_at_home_for_china_stance/fxe78vv/,nibbler666,1594272032

2740,"With a week to go before a crunch EU summit to thrash out a deal on a €750bn economic recovery plan, Europe’s major leaders are all heading to see the man standing in their way: the Netherlands’ Mark Rutte.
After visits from French president Emmanuel Macron and European Council chief Charles Michel over the past two weeks, the Dutch prime minister meets German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Thursday — the latest and perhaps most significant visit in a diplomatic dance that is increasingly being centred on The Hague ahead of next Friday’s showdown in Brussels.

As the informal chief of the EU’s “frugal four” alliance, Mr Rutte is the man the rest of Europe’s leaders need to convince of the merits of a package of measures designed to revive Europe’s economy after months of pandemic-induced hibernation. Italy’s Giuseppe Conte, Spain’s Pedro Sánchez and Portugal’s António Costa will all head to The Hague over the next week to make their case to the Dutchman.

“The Dutch have always been difficult in EU budget negotiations, but now there is the feeling that they are really punching above their weight,” said Catherine De Vries, professor of political science at Bocconi University. “The procession of EU leaders heading to Rutte shows Dutch voters that he is fighting for their national interest.”
Mr Rutte is the EU’s third longest-serving leader and has grown in diplomatic stature since Brexit. With the UK’s departure, the Netherlands has stepped up to become the bloc’s most vocal advocate for a smaller common budget and further liberalisation of the single market. 

Mr Rutte and his conservative finance minister Wopke Hoekstra have also spearheaded a group of small “Hanseatic League” nations — an alliance of northern fiscal hawks — who successfully neutered French-driven plans for a eurozone budget last year.

With a week to go before a crunch EU summit to thrash out a deal on a €750bn economic recovery plan, Europe’s major leaders are all heading to see the man standing in their way: the Netherlands’ Mark Rutte.
After visits from French president Emmanuel Macron and European Council chief Charles Michel over the past two weeks, the Dutch prime minister meets German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Thursday — the latest and perhaps most significant visit in a diplomatic dance that is increasingly being centred on The Hague ahead of next Friday’s showdown in Brussels.

As the informal chief of the EU’s “frugal four” alliance, Mr Rutte is the man the rest of Europe’s leaders need to convince of the merits of a package of measures designed to revive Europe’s economy after months of pandemic-induced hibernation. Italy’s Giuseppe Conte, Spain’s Pedro Sánchez and Portugal’s António Costa will all head to The Hague over the next week to make their case to the Dutchman.

“The Dutch have always been difficult in EU budget negotiations, but now there is the feeling that they are really punching above their weight,” said Catherine De Vries, professor of political science at Bocconi University. “The procession of EU leaders heading to Rutte shows Dutch voters that he is fighting for their national interest.”
Mr Rutte is the EU’s third longest-serving leader and has grown in diplomatic stature since Brexit. With the UK’s departure, the Netherlands has stepped up to become the bloc’s most vocal advocate for a smaller common budget and further liberalisation of the single market. 

Mr Rutte and his conservative finance minister Wopke Hoekstra have also spearheaded a group of small “Hanseatic League” nations — an alliance of northern fiscal hawks — who successfully neutered French-driven plans for a eurozone budget last year. 

The Hague now stands in the way of a landmark proposal for the EU to hand out billions of euros in grants to economies hit by the pandemic — a plan backed by France and Germany. “We simply hate it,” a Dutch diplomat said. 
Mr Rutte and his frugal quartet — made up of the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark — want Brussels’ proposal to be amended so that only loans, which eventually have to be paid back, are distributed to crisis-hit economies and not grants.

The Netherlands is also demanding that recipient countries carry out sweeping economic reforms to their labour, tax and pension systems to drive their economies towards competitiveness. Mr Rutte wants tranches of cash to be released when governments fulfil their reform promises and the ability to withhold money in case of non-compliance. 

The stance has prompted a backlash from southern Europe, with Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis warning this week that strict conditionality is “politically unacceptable” and akin to the “troika-style” monitoring by EU, European Central Bank and IMF officials associated with bailouts. Spain’s Mr Sanchez has said it is “not the right moment” to mix the recovery money with “another set of policies”.

The Netherlands’ democratic concerns over how to govern the recovery fund are shared by a wider group of countries that want member states to have a collective say in how each government plans to spend the money. But it is Mr Rutte who has drawn the most attention and opprobrium during the negotiations.

“The Dutch have never cared about having a pretty face in these talks. They come to Brussels to defend their national interest,” said an EU diplomat. “They irritate many because their bluntness can be seen as arrogance.”
During his blitz of bilateral meetings, Mr Rutte has presented European leaders with a quid pro quo: the price for greater financial solidarity is greater involvement in your national affairs by the rest of the EU.

A senior diplomat said that during his dinner with Mr Rutte in The Hague at the end of June, Mr Macron was taken aback by the way the Dutch leader questioned him about his plans to continue with controversial labour market and pension reforms in France. “This is the logical consequence of what the recovery fund means. The penny is beginning to drop,” said the diplomat.

Dutch politicians say the country’s deep suspicion about funding EU spending stem from years of growing mistrust between the northern and southern parts of the eurozone over what the rules of the game should be when it comes to risk-sharing. 

Mr Rutte was prime minister during successive Greek bailout programmes from 2010 to 2015, during which his government eventually caved in and approved loans despite vociferous opposition in the country’s parliament. “The Greek crisis nearly brought down his government,” said a national official. 

By contrast, Mr Rutte’s handling of the pandemic and his obstinate stance over the recovery fund has won him plaudits at home. His ruling centre-right Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) is enjoying its highest level of popularity in more than three years — putting Mr Rutte in pole position to win national elections next March.
Ms De Vries said growing domestic popularity could help the Dutch prime minister sell a final deal over the recovery fund later this summer. “Rutte knows he has to compromise in the end. The Dutch see themselves as book-keepers. They are willing to give money but want to know where it is going,” she said.",Lake Bled connoisseur,/r/europe/comments/hnxekq/dutch_resistance_stands_in_way_of_deal_on_eu/fxe7pal/,MelodicBerries,1594272382

2800,"&gt; It is simply a corrupt failed state.

No.  ""Failed state"" does not mean ""has problems"".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_state

&gt;A failed state is a political body that has disintegrated to a point where basic conditions and responsibilities of a sovereign government no longer function properly (see also fragile state and state collapse). A state can also fail if the government loses its legitimacy even if it is performing its functions properly. For a stable state it is necessary for the government to enjoy both effectiveness and legitimacy. Likewise, when a nation weakens and its standard of living declines, it introduces the possibility of total governmental collapse. The Fund for Peace characterizes a failed state as having the following characteristics: 
&gt;
&gt;* Loss of control of its territory, or of the monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force therein
&gt;
&gt;* Erosion of legitimate authority to make collective decisions
&gt;
&gt;* Inability to provide public services
&gt;
&gt;* Inability to interact with other states as a full member of the international community
&gt;
&gt;Common characteristics of a failing state include a central government so weak or ineffective that it has an inability to raise taxes or other support, and has little practical control over much of its territory and hence there is a non-provision of public services. When this happens, widespread corruption and criminality, the intervention of state and non-state actors, the appearance of refugees and the involuntary movement of populations, sharp economic decline, and foreign military intervention can occur.[1]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/hnf4cd/italy_will_not_accept_weak_compromise_on_eu/fxduc2i/,duisThias,1594263386

And I don't think that this is a coincidence. I think that this is a deliberate tactic on the part of the far left to push more people towards their ideology and positions away from the political center. I think they are deliberately trying to polarize the debate by being intolerant of anyone who holds more moderate views than them and essentially blackmailing them to become more extreme. They are taking advantage of the platform that BLM has brought them to go mainstream instead of staying on the fringe. Of course, they think that they are righteous and the end justifies the means, but I think that this will *equally* push people who are center right towards the far right because they are opposed to the far left. And this is how you get a seriously screwed up society.

The First Crusade was largely started because Caliph Al-Hakim bi Amr Allah had banned Palm Sunday procession at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and then a year later ordered it to be destroyed. This, combined with the East's call for help from more massive Islamic invasions, sparked the First Crusade which ultimate goal was peace. Peace for the Byzantine Emperor and for the pilgrims going to or living in the Holy Land. Islam had conquered 2/3 of the Christian world


https://scottthong.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/crusadebattlearea.jpg



The role of the Church and religion in general is overhyped. The First Crusade was largely waged by the forces of the Kingdom of France. The Church's job is to proclaim the Gospel, offer rites, and the sacraments - they had little to do with recruiting and training troops. The knights templar at the most had about 2,000 people. 


The sacking of Constantinople was done against the express will of Pope Innocent III. Innocent III organised the Fourth Crusade to liberate Jerusalem from Mohammedans, not to meddle in any Eastern affairs. He forbade, under most dire consequences, anyone from comitting any acts of violence against Eastern Christians. The Venetians ignored him and sacked Zara and Constantinople, mainly because of greed and for retaliation for the Massacre of the Latins, which happened twenty years before the Crusade and was caused mainly by mutual disdain of Venetians and Constantinopolians at that time Not to mention many forget the 1182 A.D massacre of the Latins by the Greeks. . All the Crusaders who attacked Constantinople were excommunicated even before the sack.


Yes, many crusaders committed inexcusable actions; terrible and sinful actions. But these action need to be put in historical context. Warfare prior to the Geneva conventions was, generally, full of horrors. There was rarely protection for the innocent and plundering and pillaging was expected for the victors. It would have been ahistorical to expect the Crusading armies to behave like 21st century, Western armies. That would be a bit like saying, ""why weren't the Bostonians worried about the ecological consequences of the dumping all that tea into Boston Harbor?""



&gt;  I'd say there was a lot of needlessly spilled blood. 


Considering how much better Europe became once Christianity was adopted over paganism, and how Christianity put an end to bloody cults of the Mayans, Aztecs and Cathars, I'd argue the blood they spilled was not in vain. Unironically did you not think that pagans did not have brutal warfare and practices of their own?

2891,"The metro is expanding in West Attica and the new metro stations in Nice, Korydallos and Agia Varvara will be delivered to the public on Tuesday, July 7, 2020.

The [**Nikos Tachiaos**](https://www.newsbeast.gr/tag/nikos-tachiaos) , president of the [**Athens Metro**](https://www.newsbeast.gr/tag/attiko-metro) , states in his post on Facebook that the new ""three stations - jewelry» Metro add other 63.000 passengers on the network, who move easily and quickly.

Mr. Tachiaos makes special reference to the new metro station in Agia Varvara, which is located below Ag. Barbara, at a depth of 20 meters. As he explains, during the construction works, an underground aqueduct consisting of a carved tunnel was found, the ground of which is a clay pipeline. It was decided to move the pipeline and display it at the station, both for the promotion of the monument and for the completion of the technical works. The impressive exhibition with the ancient pipeline is at the ticket level and is expected to attract the attention of passengers.

""It is finally time to hear a big thumbs up for the people of Attiko Metro SA, who in the 29 years that have passed since its establishment, have managed to integrate and develop a huge know-how that brings visible changes that are now spreading to the entire urban fabric of Athens and Piraeus ""explains Nikos Tachiaos.

He adds: ""This is a company that justifies not only the decision to establish it, but also the choice of the government of Konstantinos Mitsotakis under the ministry of Stefanos Manos to entrust its organization to foreign consultants. A big thank you also goes to all of them, engineers and staff of Attiko Metro SA. who continue to work with the same warmth and efficiency under conditions very different from those they encountered in the beginning. ""

""The citizens of Attica are experiencing a continuous improvement of their movements thanks to the work of these people. We remain committed to this goal, acknowledging, of course, that multiple administrations before ours have their own contribution to make. ""

In closing, Attica Metro President Nikos Tachiaos sends a message to the citizens of Thessaloniki, emphasizing: ""I reiterate our commitment that in early 2023 Thessaloniki will enter the same trajectory, acquiring one of the most modern metros in Europe.""

The entire extension of Line 3 is expected to be put into commercial operation in the summer of 2022. With the completion of the project and the addition of the other three stations ""Maniatika"", ""Piraeus"" and ""Municipal Theater"" an increase in total passenger traffic is expected in Metro network to 132,000 citizens per day, thus reducing the circulation of private cars. vehicles by 23,000 per day as well as carbon dioxide emissions by 120 tons per day, while the route from the port to the airport will be covered by the metro in just 55 minutes ""concluded Mr. Tachiaos.

Because in effect it ends up giving precedence to nuclear plants and treating renewables as an extra.

&gt;The issue is that we are not able to sustain a power grid with renewables only because most are intermittent and non pilotable. So we need to complement them with peak energy plants. 

A nuclear-focused generator fleet either needs the same peaker plants, or needs to run its plants suboptimally, resulting in a price per energy that is the same or more than building peaker plants would have cost. There's no way around the peakers. So we might as well use them to allow renewables.

A naive Western European 10 years ago never thought Russia could ever invade Ukraine, too. But we weren't even surprised, tbh. 

* Securisation of the Russian threat is yielding significant results, and isn't only about scaremongering. We have real defense capabilities to deter some aspects of the invasion already. We're also working on more defense coordination, sharing, etc. in the region. If you haven't noticed, almost every country has a geopolitical threat to shout about. The constant shouting and actions taken thanks to that shouting is why we have much more talk and much less military action.

* Lithuanians frequently get accused of strong irrationality and romanticism. And yet, that irrationality allowed us to be at the forefront of breaking out of the USSR and being on the right side of history. While Latvians and Estonians frequently cowered behind our words and actions in the name of upkeeping their Lutheran rational ethos, they followed us on many issues (such as the fact that they are less and less likely to preach ""pragmatic cooperation"" with Russia).",,/r/europe/comments/hnkfl6/lithuania_bans_kremlins_rt/fxcqo4r/,Gremlinator_TITSMACK,1594241867

Now, I don't trust Russia but RT is pretty easy to watch precisely because you always know who the sender of the message is. It's Putin's propaganda. With stuff from the US (as an example) it's much more difficult to interpret the content because it's often hard to tell who the real sender is. Who's propaganda are you watching? Who is trying to benefit from it and in what way? Is it a political actor? A company? An industry? A religious group? What parts are trustworthy? How is it angled? In that way broadcasters like RT and CCTV are much easier to handle.

I also believe in educating people by allowing them to see a multitude of differing opinions. RT has reported the Russian point of view so what about NHK, CCTV, Al Jazeera and all the other state owned networks? What are they reporting? What about different, private news networks? Are there differences in the reporting? If there are... why? What interests do the different groups have and how could it affect the reporting regarding this particular subject?

I’d like to offer you something to check out as well! The mobile app isn’t letting me link right now, but there’s a really good book called “Johann Trollmann and Romani Resistance to The Nazis” I recommend checking out! His life story is really incredible, there’s several articles about him too but they’re not as comprehensive as the book. It’s interesting how he’s had a lot of recognition within local communities, but his story never broke into the mainstream, or even just the mainstream of historical communities. (I’m trying to research right now his impact on boxing, he was the first one to fight in the style that’s traditionally credited to Muhammad Ali. I’m wondering if they each invented their styles independently or if Trollmann influenced Ali’s style more directly.) Anyways, I think he’s someone that everyone should learn about to get a really good understanding of how Roma were treated during that time, and just bc his story is too interesting to ignore in my opinion 
Also yes I’m hoping it’ll change too! My younger friends in Europe, CZ included, have all been so open minded towards these things. It gives me hope that even though things are really bad right now, once their generation is in charge things will get a lot better.

3158,"That was really helpful and well-written I’d like to actually thank you for the effort and time you’ve put in this message.

&gt;A non-propagandistic news outlet will present a series of facts from their particular point of view, while propaganda selectively combines certain facts and fiction to force a particular synthesis of thoughts in the public's mind. It uses loaded language, it's aggressive, appeals to emotions and it's ultimately manipulative with the goal of furthering themselves.

I agree but high quality propaganda doesn’t use half-truths and fallacies. My personal beef with LRT and outlets like them started from the covering of certain historical events when they used loaded language. Discontent with the RT started when they were covering American elections by spreading agenda when they were (and are still) called propaganda outlets due to amplifying certain views, facts that are convenient to them.

&gt;Let's imagine this is the story: ""Last Saturday, an agricultural town reported that their crop yield has decreased due to recent bad weather. Scientist says this could be due to Climate Change but a local farmer says everything was growing fine until a storm struck the town a couple of days prior""

&gt;Pretty objective. We are reporting on a story in a particular place with particular characters. Now let's look at different agendas.

&gt;Media 1 might display the story like this: A storm strikes local town, causing a decrease in crop yield. Climate Change is a possible cause.

&gt;Media 2, meanwhile, does this: Climate Change causes storms that could decrease crop yield and affect farmers.

&gt;Media 3 might just say this: Storm in Local Town stumps production of crops.

&gt;How would propaganda display it? Like the following:

&gt;”A horrible storm leaves a poor farmer town helpless and scientist uses it as a further excuse to say that ""Climate Change"" exists""

&gt;Notice the entirely different focus. It's not about reporting a story anymore from different perspectives, it's actively redacting something in a way that makes people get to the conclusion you want them to get at. It's also very emotional in nature. It makes a person say ""How dare this scientist use the disgrace of a town of poor people to further their agenda???"" Especially if that person already has bias against the existence of climate change from the beginning.

Well, here’s where I disagree.  The propaganda example you’ve provided is a bit of exaggerated- this is something a tabloid would write for clicks. The real propaganda is always more subtle and doesn’t focus on a single article.

If I was asked to spread climate change denial, I’d actually find an expert that is either skeptical that a single event can’t be connected to the climate change or focus on a statistics that align with my narrative. The safest was is to ignore the scientific opinion. Probably I’d use synthesis of these tactics. My propagandistic display would be:

“Local crops decreased because of bad weather, scientists aren’t sure what was the cause”

Which would give me the clicks (bad weather was the cause of crops decrease but scientists still don’t know what was the cause), save my integrity and promote my narrative that there is no consensus on the matter.

&gt;”Here we go again! This time Lithuania BANS RT, claiming it is led by journalist who heads TOTALLY DIFFERENT network

&gt;Lithuania has followed its neighbor Latvia’s lead to ban five RT channels based on “recommendations” from the country’s Foreign Ministry, but offered the same bogus and bizarre excuse for the decision.

&gt;Indeed, officials in Vilnius were no more creative with their reasoning for the ban than those in Riga last month, as they came up with the same faulty logic to justify their censorship. Announcing the ban, the regulator said it was being handed down because RT is headed by Russian journalist Dmitry Kiselyov, who is under EU sanctions.""

&gt;Now, if this was an opinion piece, perhaps the use of the strong language would be justified, but it isn't an opinion piece, it's presented as news. 

To be quite honest they are reporting on themselves and clearly want to be seen as victims

&gt;It's not all Propaganda, they report on matters that have little to do with who they are, at least in a surface-level, because it passes them off as more legit, following the principle that some people believe in ""If an article is credible then all of them are.""

3211,"&gt; The worst part is that progressing to lithium was last ""easy"" jump in this technology, from now one things will get harder and harder.

There are fundamentally different technologies in development. Solid-state batteries is one such future technology, which would bring much higher capacities and much quicker charges. Could be 5 years until it will be commercially viable, or it could take 20 years or more. But the point is that lithium is far from the ""last"" technological step.

&gt; So we have to get fancier and smarter about how we squeeze more energy or power into the same amount of space and weight, and therefore progress gets slower and harder to do.

Yeah, except for the fact that the first commercial Li-ion battery arrived in 1991, and we're still seeing remarkable progress. For instance, the article I linked outlines how there has been a 87% reduction in the cost for the same capacity in the 9 years from 2010 to 2019. That's an average reduction in price of 20% year on year for the same capacity. Sure, volume and mass for the same capacity haven't changed nearly as much, but there is solid progress there as well. For instance, in that same article, there is a section with a quote by the CTO of Tesla. He says that the 85 kWh battery pack in the 2012 Model S was smaller than the 53 kWh battery pack of 2008 Roadster.

Let's compare the numbers. The 53 kWh battery in the Roadster weighs 450 kg, at a volume of 140 L and offers an energy density of 117 Wh/kg and 370 Wh/L, [according to its Wikipedia page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster_(2008\)) Then for the 2012 Model S, those numbers were then at 85 kWh at 540 kg, giving us 157 Wh/kg. I can't find any measure for it's volume, but it's less than 140 L according to the CTO. So the energy density is over 600 Wh/L.

That's an increase in density of 34% in terms of mass and over 60% in terms of volume in 4 years. That's pretty good. Sure, progress has slowed since then, but with each new battery cell, the density is increased by another notch.

But I don't see how it's that important anyway? Sure, it matters for cars, but what matters the most there is absolutely costs. That's the most important factor for electric cars, and for battery storage power stations it's essentially the only thing that matters. Sure, it's nice to reduce the size of the power station, but it's really not even a priority compared to costs. And as I noted, costs have plummeted over the past decade by 90% for the same capacity.

&gt; though this still doesnt take into account energy storage cost. which should be added to cost of renewables.

That's true. And that's included in the Lazard link. My first link also showed that this in combination with renewables is cheaper than gas peakers. Batteries or gas peakers is also something that is still needed for nuclear, even if it is to a much lesser extent than for renewables. Nuclear gives a stable production, but demand is anything but stable, which means you need to use gas peakers or battery storage to fit production to the demand. In the past, France has tried to get around this by ramping up production on nuclear plants during peak hours and scaling back on off-hours, with some even shutting down over weekends. That increases costs though, and it cannot respond quickly to rapidly changing demands, like a lot of people putting on the kettle to boil water during a quick break during a popular live sports program. That makes gas peakers or batteries preferable.

&gt; here is something to read about lifespan of grid energy storage:

That was an interesting read, so thanks for that. But I still don't see the problem? Given how quickly the technology improves, you'd want to recycle the components eventually even if the lifespan was unlimited, so I really don't see what the problem is?",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/hmr1yk/eu_lawmakers_ban_nuclear_from_green_transition/fxcbggr/,DirtyPoul,1594234622

I don't know where you picked that 14% data, so I'd use even a lower one taken from the [italian statistics](https://lab24.ilsole24ore.com/coronavirus/) for my example:

It is belive that the mortality rate for people around 60-69 was of the 10.6%.

This alone means that every person out of 5 could had lost one of their parents if the virus were let free to roam around.

But of course that data is incorrect, because the mortality rate was of the 10.6% with a functioning health-care system that can take care of the infected.

Now, in Italy we have seen the best of our hospitals brought to their knees at the start of the pandemic, and if it wasn't for the quaranthine they would have lickely collapsed.

My wild guess is that 10.6% would have raised consistently.

Here’s some direct quotes from politicians in the past 7 years to illustrate how this is a systemic problem as well! 

“Perhaps Hitler didn’t kill enough of them” -French MP in 2013, in response to Gypsy hunts

“Brazen, feral, human-like creatures” -Bulgarian officials 

“Animals who should not be allowed to exist - in no way.” -Zsolt Bayer, co-founder of the current party in power in Hungary, 2013.

Let’s also not forget how Slovakia elected a neo nazi into parliament, who ran his campaign on promising forced labor &amp; sterilization of Roma.

3254,"&gt; ""Absorb excesses"" works out to ""Dont charge on quiet, cloudy days"". Which is not workable because a: Electrics generally only have range for 2-3 days regular driving, and b: it just postpones the demand.

Yes, postponing demand for a few days is enough to cope with variability over a few days. For other variability, we have other stabilizers. It's not a total solution for the entire grid, obviously.

&gt;Look. We want people to adopt electric cars. For reasons of resource restraint, we do not want people to buy electric cars with monstrously oversized batteries. This means that every morning when Shannon puts her behind in the car, It needs to read ""100% charge"". This means there is space to shift the charging around the hours between when Shannon came home, and when she leaves in the morning. Not between days.

There's also a charging opportunity during the day. In fact, many companies consist of a compound with a big, flat roof and big, flat parking that is full of cars during the day, both of which can easily be turned in to solar panel arrays. All we need to do is to let the cars that are parked there anyway charge up during the day too. That makes even the current generation of electric cars more than adequate for the median commute. We don't need to provide a complete solution for the salesperson driving their car all day long to unfamiliar destinations. Let's start with the bulk and work on the exceptions later, let those salespeople keep their diesel for the time being. We can't produce enough to swap out the entire car volume in the same year anyway. 

That does mean that the solar production peak at noon can flow straight into all those commuter cars.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/hmr1yk/eu_lawmakers_ban_nuclear_from_green_transition/fxccc6c/,silverionmox,1594235032

Since then, we've seen at least [one plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beznau_Nuclear_Power_Plant) operate past its 51^st birthday, and, unless I am mistaken, plans being made to extend operations into the eighth decade for at least *some* american plants.

The *life expectancy* of a plant can designate a rather wide array of concepts and ideas. For example, the EPR currently being built are planned to operate for *no less* than 40 years, and this timespan is the one on which the business plan and the financing is built.

It does not mean, of course, that the plant will revert to a  pumkin when the clock strikes midnight on its 40^th birthday. Neither will it crumble into a heap of steaming radioactive rubbles.

Questions *will* be asked however, and decisions will be made, on whether the plant shall be decommissionned or if some investments shall be made into the continuation of safe operations.

3358,"&gt; Markets allocate scarce resources.

To those who can afford it. 

Housing crisis is not that we don't have enough upscale housing. Those do not help the crisis, at all. At no point you seem to consider that without home, you are homeless. There is no point when the market is truly free. There is no abundance and even when there is: they are left empty rather than rented cheaper. 

Free market solution does not work, it REQUIRES homeless people or it doesn't work. There has really never been a time when  people could shop around where to live. Those rules don't work on pretty much any essential services.

Your whole point is to try to EXPLAIN how the current system works and that somehow proves that it is working. It isn't. Giving homes to homeless is our duty and it decreases costs in the long run. But because there are too many that sees it as NIMBY and then of course greed about those same property prices stops us doing it. 

&gt; Why isn't there enough housing available to keep prices from rising in your situation?

Because you can get more profit by not building low cost housing at all and building upscale housing instead, in fewer numbers. So far, private market has absolutely no interest trying to provide housing but all incentives to make profit. 

And they rather keep them empty than rent at lower prices. 

Finnish construction costs are high because of strict regulation about energy efficiency and having high living standards over all.. The point i made already that low cost housing does not cost that much less to build compared to upscale. So of course they will build upscale.. and people in those upscale places do not know that it is literal veneer, a surface that looks nice but everything inside the walls, ceilings and floor is exactly the same. You add 10% on top and can sell or rent it at much higher price.

The problem we have now here is that rents are so high compared to wages that we are losing shopping power and it stagnates the rest of the economy. And instead of housing getting better for all, some get more options. People are getting poorer while rents keep rising. There are still too many below poverty line and EU has warned us for a decade now to do something. We did: we made it MUCH worse by freeing rent regulations even more until they are now gone. Low cost housing is still needed but it is not being built. There is enough time that has passed, if it worked, we would've seen it already.

Note: i don't give a FUCK if property owners take a hit. I really don't care. I care that everyone has a rood over their heads. If free market can't do it: it has FAILED and we need to take over. Until everyone has a roof over their heads, there is NO ROOM for private market. After we have done that basic, then free market has room to offer better for those that can afford it. And we also need to keep every single fucking block of housing spread among social classes: millionaires and unemployed need to live side by side.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/hneknq/rents_up_by_208_house_prices_by_205_since_2007_in/fxbwrz5/,HeippodeiPeippo,1594227836

Piłsudski concluded that the best course of action would be one that supported the pro-Polish faction in Lithuania, but that could not be traced directly to Poland. However, his plans for a coup d'état in 1919 had been foiled by the premature and unplanned Sejny Uprising, which had led to the destruction of the Polish Military Organization (P.O.W.) intelligence network in Lithuania by the Lithuanian Army and State Security Department.

Poland broke an international ceasefire.

Polish Chief of State Józef Piłsudski surreptitiously ordered Żeligowski to carry out the operation, and revealed the truth several years later.

When you unrepairable lose the RPV (reactor pressure vessel you call it containment vessel) or the main coolant pumps, your reactor is a financial gunner, it is not possible to replace one of the four main coolant pumps or the RPV without either going red forever or damaging the building structure forever.

Everything else can and will be replaced. There are reactors running longer then Tihange with much less issues. Tihanges RPV has some unique steel properties that makes it degrade faster (or Belgium authorities just demand more controls and checks)

I know alot of power plants that have undergone extreme changes outside of the main coolant pumps and RPV. Changed entire I&amp;C from analog to digital, changed turbines, generators, heat exchanger (oh Boy this is complicated and almost never done), fixed millionsnof holes, run the reactor with small leaks in primary circle for months (allowed by authorities). Almost anything is repair and changeable. 

And when it comes to the RPV, you can still do slot. Usually the problem is not with the main body, but the head. And you change the head of needed. Then it's with the instrumentation, you can change that too. Fuel rods are moved out anyway once a year. You can move the entire active core into the cooling bay and work the RPV from the inside. There is so much repair possible you don't even want to know.

Switzerland plans to run Leibstadt till 2045. That will be over 60 years, produced by motherfucking GE back then.

These two parties could form a single Bloc against fascism. Instead, KPD was actively attacking SPD, on orders from Moscow, and this has helped Nazis tremendously.

The fact is, that Soviets backstabbed us in 1939, and ruined our dreams for democratic state once again after WWII ended. It was no help - it was an expansion of Soviet sphere of influence. Thousands of Poles died fighting our new, Soviet occupiers. Thousands of people were imprisoned and sent to gulags. Thousands of people were murdered - infamous Katyń massacre or even 1937 NKVD anti-polish repressions. 

This all proves that Soviet Union was, in fact, an occupier, just like Nazi Germany. Granted, Soviet Union didn't plan to exterminate Poles or turn us into slave nation, but it was still an occupier. And as such, we can't consider USSR to be ""savior"" of Poland.

&gt; it has to be [...] affordable electricity

Then look no further than renewables, which are far cheaper and more flexible (in their deployment) than nuclear energy.

&gt; and it has to be reliable

And this is the crux of the problem, I hear you saying. Indeed, the main issue of renewable energy is the fact that they are intermittent. However, there are ways to mitigate that. Solar energy and wing energy are relatively inversely correlated, so having both help you cover a lot of your needs during the day. The issue is during the evening/night, when you can't rely on solar, and there is no wind sometimes. In order to solve this, you need to interconnect European networks to a much higher degree than there are currently. For instance, when there is no wind in Poland, there might be a lot of wind in Denmark, and inversely. Having more cooperation between countries can help a lot with that problem.

But then, a solution will come thanks to electric vehicles. You say that clean energy is a prerequisite to having clean transport, I answer that clean transport will be the solution to having clean energy. During a typical working day, people will take their EVs to work, then come back in the evening and plug them in. But, instead of being charged, the batteries in the EVs will be used to help the network. It is known that in the early evening, there is a spike in electricity, as people come back from work, switch on the television, start cooking, start the washing machine, use their vacuum, etc. In short, they use a lot of electricity. The power left in EVs batteries can thus be used to supplement other forms of electricity generation at this peak. The batteries will then be charged later on during the night, when we are at a low in electricity demand. This scenario isn't sci-fi. This is a very concrete solution that is being investigated. In order to do this, we need to upgrade networks, but it can be done.",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/hmr1yk/eu_lawmakers_ban_nuclear_from_green_transition/fxag4go/,Pampamiro,1594191459

It is important to note that protests are not against lockdown as most people say. Protests are sparked by a 4-day total lockdown/curfew but to get the whole picture there are few important bits of information.

Serbian government has been abusing power for years in pretty much every conceivable way while blatantly lying and manipulating public media and destroying institutions!

Government's response to COVID-19 has been chaotic and confusing from the start. In early days, official stance was ""it is the most ridiculous virus, just like the flu"" (said by the president himself)

Once the pandemic started blowing up, they implemented sudden lockdown/curfew more aggressive than anywhere else in Europe. People had to stay inside for days and were arrested if went out to walk their dogs.

After few weeks of tight lockdown, they announced that the virus has been defeated and they let everything reopen in anticipation of snap elections few weeks later.

In the weeks leading up to the elections, COVID-19 open data portal stopped publishing health data. Another official source started showing statistically dubious data. Government insisted that the data is correct and everything is under control.

Elections were a farse with no opposition, no free media, organized vote buying and voter intimidation. The ruling party ended up with 2/3 of the parlament and the power to rewrite constitution and further corrode the institutions.

Days after the elections leaked information revealed that the real COVID-19 picture is much much worse. They used centralized reporting system to conceal real data and paint a fake picture about infections and deaths while telling the public that everything is under control.

Once doctors started coming out to public it became obvious that the situation is very very serious and now suddenly we go from ""everything under control"" and fake data to total lockdown/curfew.

At the same time, information and evidence is surfacing that the elections were not legally conducted at most pooling stations. TLDR: government is fucking with covid while rigging elections.",,/r/europe/comments/hn3v1a/mass_protests_breakout_in_belgrade_against_the/fxaggfa/,akirodic,1594191767

Safety, meaning fighting Al-Shaabab in the region and pushing them out, fighting piracy on the seas and educating locals on its negative effects while strengthening local police. Supporting local government, including building a functional court system, central administration and economic responsible systems. Growth and jobs, trying to improve conditions for young people, moving away from practices of over exploiting land with extensive charcoal production and educating people in new fields such as fx. veterinarians, given the country relies heavily on livestock. Strengthened resistance to droughts and better living conditions, introducing stockpiling and better resource management, the goal is to wean Somalia off foreign aid and lessen the need for humanitarian aid in general.

4013,"erdogan lost last local elections. Quote from erdogan: ""If you lose istanbul, you'll lose Turkey"", which he had. He lost many of metropolitan municipalities; Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir and Adana. Opponent parties have dynamic and trustworthy candidates unlike erdogan's corrupt party. They investigated  to find a dirty thing in pasts of these candidates and couldn't find anything. So they have called Istanbul mayor as Greek/Roman(claiming he is not a Turk) , this is how desperate they are.

erdogan owns 95% of Turkish media, but people are not buying his propaganda any more. If you watch some of these streams you'd think Turkey is doing better than Norway. FOX news is the most trustable TV channel in here, so this is how f.cked our media is. Recently twitter banned 7000 of pro-erdogan trolls. There are thousands of trolls are trying to create artificial agenda to mislead Turkish people. Most of these efforts are fruitless.

Lastly erdogan said he'll ban social media including netflix. Cause they don't control them. After that he had to step back cause of the reactions. He can't do anything as he wants any more. In conclusion, we have better days ahead if we don't get involved any war in near future.

We and Ukraine fought for Eastern Galicia, region that was and is a mix of Polish and Ukrainian cultures. Even though the land was taken by Poland, most people there were Ukrainians or speaking Ukrainian. Therefore I would say no, people there didn't want to be a part of Poland, which they ""showed"" 20 years later during the massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia.

The UK banned the slave trade in 1807. but Virginia (a slave state) banned the slave trade in [1778](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade#End_of_the_Atlantic_slave_trade) and the rest of the states followed. The [Slave Trade Act of 1794](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_Trade_Act_of_1794) made importing slaves illegal anywhere in the US. The UK acted 13-19 years after America depending on how you score it.

None of that prevented people from being slaves if there were already slaves. Not until the [Emancipation Proclamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation) of 1863 and 13th Amendment in 1865 did we end a person being a slave.

Aristocrats didn't like socialistic republics and communist movements, which became especially popular after WW1 and october revolution in Russia. And such anticommunism led baron to fascism.

&gt; ""We are proud of our traditions. We are not ashamed of the swastika that we use, it has nothing to do with Nazi Germany,"" said Air Commander Jari Mikkonen to the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper. 

Can air commander Jari Mikkonen remind me what differentation system finnish air forces used at those times?

Yellow circles, just like nazis?

And fought side by side in ""crusade against bolshevism""?

And called it ""brothers in arms"" aka ""waffenbruderschaft""?

And landed on same aerodromes?

&gt; One had to explain again and again. 

...and always failed to explain convincingly. Because there is only one logical explanation, but Finland doesn't want to accept it, because it breaks national mythology.

&gt; The fact that the swastika was prominently placed on the Luftwaffe Command's emblem and on its website would have opened the door to misunderstandings and malicious interpretations 

Actions done under swastics leave no place to misunderstandings.

&gt; In 1998, the fundamentalist Welfare Party was declared unconstitutional on the grounds of threatening the secularism of Turkey and was shut down by the Turkish constitutional court. Erdoğan became a prominent speaker at demonstrations held by his party colleagues.[51]
In December 1997 in Siirt, Erdoğan recited a poem from a work written by Ziya Gökalp, a pan-Turkish activist of the early 20th century.[8] His recitation included verses translated as ""The mosques are our barracks, the domes our helmets, the minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers....""[32] which are not in the original version of the poem. Erdoğan said the poem had been approved by the education ministry to be published in textbooks.[52] Under article 312/2 of the Turkish penal code his recitation was regarded as an incitement to violence and religious or racial hatred.[53] He was given a ten-month prison sentence of which he served four months, from 24 March 1999 to 27 July 1999.[7] Due to his conviction, Erdoğan was forced to give up his mayoral position. The conviction also stipulated a political ban, which prevented him from participating in parliamentary elections.[54] He had appealed for the sentence to be converted to a monetary fine, but it was reduced to 120 days instead.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/hmolh9/turkish_prosecutor_declines_to_pursue_killing_of/fx8frtk/,0_0-wooow,1594148719

Obviously, Saudi Arabia wasn't openly actively involved in suppressing a neighbouring country at that stage, so the calculation might have been different at that time, they were at that stage merely a dictatorial country with a tendency to support terrorists, not actually acting actively militarily themselves, so it was more plausible that it might be used for self defence.

But there is one thing you said which is this ""even though it's called the European Union, it's not a club about being in Europe""   

That is wrong. In 1987 Morocco applied to join the European Communities (a precursor to the EU). And the reason it was rejected was because Morocco could not be considered a European country, and as such, could not join. Later on, this concept led to the geographic conditions of the Copenhagen criteria. The ""arbitrary definition of a continent"" has already lead to a country not being allowed to join.

[Occupation costs – Burdens resulting from the war]

(1) The Federation shall finance the expenditures for occupation costs and other internal and external burdens resulting from the war, as regulated in detail by federal laws. To the extent that these war burdens were regulated by federal laws on or before 1 October 1969, the Federation and the Länder shall finance such expenditures in the proportion established by such federal laws. Insofar as expenditures for such of these war burdens as neither have been nor will be regulated by federal laws were met on or before 1 October 1965 by Länder, municipalities (associations of municipalities) or other entities performing functions of the Länder or municipalities, the Federation shall not be obliged to finance them even after that date. The Federation shall be responsible for subsidies towards meeting the costs of social security, including unemployment insurance and public assistance to the unemployed. The distribution of war burdens between the Federation and the Länder prescribed by this paragraph shall not be construed to affect any law regarding claims for compensation for consequences of the war.

(2) Revenue shall pass to the Federation at the time it assumes responsibility for the expenditures referred to in this Article.",TÖRÖKÖRÖK,/r/europe/comments/hmsd3s/germany_spent_over_1_billion_to_cover_costs/fx7zhvk/,Formtestudo,1594141097

Starting with the old testament where only the purest, specific materials were allowed in the main part of the temple/synagogue,      
 continuing with the new testament where he praised the poor woman giving everything she had as an offering to the temple, (sure, he condemned the rich guy but it was because of his imperfect offering, not because he offered something to begin with)      
and finally reaching the early Christians were it was quite clear that poverty ends at the first step of the altar, eventhough they had so little.

The churches teaching since it's inception in 33AD was always that all materials come from God anyway and we should offer him what is most valuable for us, not mentioning that given role of religious statues in Latin, Greek and Oriental Christianity it quite obviously furthers spirituality.

I am the first to critisize Bishops driving in overbudgeted cars and throwing money away where it doesn't need to be spent (even on Statues that are needlessly expensive), however not even St. Francis himself, the founder of one of the largest mendicant orders, would celebrate Mass in anything other than a Golden chalice and see a statue made from the works and gifts of his flock as a testament of their faith and not put it against starving children unconnected to him. 

The church has various orders and groups dedicated to various things, some help the poor, some contemplate and it can't focus only on one thing.

I don't think you were alive to remember the elections of the first decade (neither was I but I've studied old articles from that time.) In 2001 and 2005 they ran on a Christian democratic platform and ran anti-corruption campaigns. 

Shit hit the fan after the 2005 elections when they upset the Civic Platform. Tusk was hoping that he would win and form a center-right coalition with PiS but that PO would hold all the important offices in the government. Then Tusk lost the presidential election to Lech Kaczynski after which he had no leg to stand on. Despite this, PiS offered a moderate to be Prime Minister but Tusk still refused.  Meanwhile in the presidential race Kaczynski was endorsed by the far-right LPR and SPR and so they Jaroslaw decided to just form a government with them. 

The rest of course is history. PiS turned hard to the right in order to eat up their coalition partners and PO turned to the center and started their Kaczor-bad campaign which still lasts today.

My choice was not arbitrary. As I wrote specifically, [my idea was to choose the subnational division in Europe with the highest GDP according to the Eurostat.](https://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=nama_10r_3gdp&amp;lang=en)


&gt;But you are forgetting that the gdp contribution from companies is counted where their HQ is and not where they do the things they do. 

Again, the same problem happens with companies moving their HQ to countries such as the Netherlands (you think Exor or FCA are there because of their operations?) or Ireland or Luxembourg because of favorable tax regimes. I think it is not unfair or immoral (amoral if anything) but it is not unique to cities.

&gt;If we go around cherry picking places you could argue that a place like silicon vally has the highest gdp in the world.

I do not think you know the difference between GDP and GDP per capita.

The UK National Quantum Technologies programme for example has passed over $1.27billion in investments since its inception in 2014. On top of multiple different British governments putting investments into this field. (For example, in 2019 [the UK government announced a new investment of £153million alongside £205million from industry into an fund specifically created for the purpose of commercialising quantum technology.](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-153-million-programme-to-commercialise-uks-quantum-tech).)

When it comes to Quantum technology, not only does the UK stack up favourably with China or the US, it actually takes the lead in several key areas of innovation, of investment, of research.

But here's the inherent problem with spending ""Just Transition Fund"" money on gas. It doesn't need it. It's profitable. The reason why it's allowed is because these companies that operate and continue to build new CCGT plants want to increase their profit margins further (without effort), and lobbying for this transition fund is a pretty easy and risk-free way of doing it.

In times before the internet in the 60s you could probably rob a small province bank in a different EU country and would be pretty safe IF (pretty big if robbing a bank is harder as getting access to kids as a priest) you somehow found a way to exchange the money and get back to your country.

That's also why your 50 years vs 1 week argument sucks. The internet makes information gathering and access so much faster these days. 50 years ago the pedophile in germany would had needed his own little library with movies and pictures stored inside his house, and these days it's all on a single hard drive.

&gt; But keep smearing, that'll help

New renewables can't replace coal in Germany unless gas replaces coal at the same time. If they could you wouldn't need 20 years to shut down coal plants.

On the future energy system prospect, if CO2 reduction is the ultimate goal then CCGT can't be much a part of that anyway. CCGT needs a high enough capacity factor to be economical, that's why they're not used as peakers. But that means that a significant amount of the grid mix will be gas - which means the grid won't be able to meet something like the IPCC carbon intensity guidelines.

4804,"The pandemic has made Central Europe richer than Italy and Spain.

Madrid lifted the ban on entry from the Schengen States on 21st June, just in time to save the tourist season. But instead of the crowds that flooded the beaches of the Costa del Sol, the Balearic Islands or the Canary Islands at this time of year, there is emptiness. Germany and the British are afraid to come to one of the most affected countries in Covid-19. They also don't want to spend too much money on holidays in uncertain times.


For Spain, which derives more than 13% of its GDP from tourism, this is a drama. But Italy, Greece and Portugal are experiencing a similar tragedy. All the more so because that is not all. - In the south of Europe, structural problems have accumulated: high unemployment, huge debt, demographic collapse, administrative inefficiencies. This is what makes up an unprecedented crisis,' says Wolfango Piccoli, vice-president of London's leading consultancy Teneo.

The IMF predicts that this year the Spanish economy will collapse by 12.8%. The kingdom has not survived such a collapse since the end of the civil war in 1939. The Fund expects equally bad results for Italy.

In his opinion, the crisis will be much milder in Central Europe: in Poland the economy will contract by 4.6%, in Hungary by 3.1%, and in the Czech Republic by 6.5%. These are countries that not only have a more effective protection against the pandemic, but also have lower debt, more competitive industry and a more favourable structure of the economy.

Already before the crisis, our region caught up with the south of Europe in terms of per capita income (taking into account real purchasing power). For example, the Czech Republic (40.5 thousand dollars per capita, IMF data) was already on a par with Italy (41.5 thousand) and Spain (43.0 thousand). In turn, Poland (35.6 thousand) or Hungary (35.7 thousand) already several years ago overtook Greece (31.6 thousand) and last year Portugal (34.9 thousand). However, there are many indications that after the pandemic the pole of poverty will move permanently from our region to the south.

This is already visible in Brussels. For the first time since the enlargement of the Union in 2004, it is the prime ministers of Spain and Italy who put the most pressure on transfers from Germany or the Netherlands (through the Reconstruction Fund), not their counterparts from Poland or Hungary.

But Piccoli warns: the money from Brussels won't start until next year, too late to stop the avalanche of unemployment, business bankruptcies and poverty in the Mediterranean countries.

In Spain 3.8 million people are already unemployed and a further 3 million are on compulsory leave. In Italy, the queue for free food has increased by one million since the pandemic broke out. And this is only the beginning of the crisis.

I think a three-pronged approach would work:

- tax income from short-term rentals higher and make them buy insurance
- lower taxes on hotels and relax the requirements
- split hotel stars into tourist stars and business stars, rearrange amenity requirements so things tourists want are prioritised (AC, WiFi) and the maids don't have to touch your bed linens every day.

5096,"the Trump administration instituted a ""zero-tolerance"" policy of prosecuting every illegal border crossing. This differs to the Obama-era policy, where families that crossed together would usually be deported, but not necessarily prosecuted -- so they'd be removed from the US, but not actually charged criminally.

What this means is that they have to detain these people until they can be prosecuted (and subsequently deported). But, they didn't have any form of detention where families could be detained together, and building some sort of facility for this would have been far too logical and humane (ICE are fascist pigs). So they started separating families who were suspected of having crossed the border illegally and imprisoning/detaining them separately. 

Members of the Trump Administration explicitly described this as an intended effect that was supposed to serve as a deterrent.

A lot of these were done with extremely poor documentation -- families were separated in some cases with no records made of who was taken where, who had been traveling with who, etc. Before the policy was ended due to severe backlash, around 3000 kids were separated from their families. If I'm not mistaken, some of those kids are still in ICE custody today because they can't find and/or are unwilling to find anyone to release them to (that usually has to be their parents or a relative who's already in the US and is willing to care for them), often because of their own incompetence with record keeping.

(And that's to say absolutely nothing of the shitty conditions inside these camps. The government has been sued hundreds of times over this, [arguing once that toothbrushes and soap weren't necessary for the ""safe and sanitary"" conditions that they're legally required to provide](https://www.newsweek.com/migrant-children-border-trump-administration-1445090)

Trump is, in a way, kinda smart; he has never let any any event - good or bad - be the Main Thing for more than a moment. He says something preposterous and demonstrably false; does he let it just sit there, attractions attention? Nope. 

He does something else. Says something else. Or doesn’t when he really really should. 

It is amazing. It is also somewhat revealing of what the citizenry can become; a mob. This is a difficult time for democracy in general, particularly so for its primary champion the USA. 

Social media really encourages and enables us to exist in “information bubbles” which reinforce whatever we believe, are susceptible to, etc. We do not have an equivalent to the front page of the newspaper that everyone looks at. Instead we are reading from a sheet that is tailor made to attract our eye and clicks (and therefore ad revenue). 

Newsrooms have always had their bent. Heck, the Spanish American War can be largely understood, in part, as a manufactured event. However, in general there was a sort of code, a debate, a modicum of “middle-ness” that rules the news. That is no longer the case; our brains are designed to accept stimuli and oh buddy we have it in our hands. 

Look at us now; it is almost midnight and I am staring at a screen. A few years ago I might be reading a book. And for the overwhelming majority of human history I would be asleep. We all would, but here we are glued to these tiny things because our brains can’t get enough. And the algorithms play to it the same as salt, sugar and fat are a
perfect recipe to get anything into our mouths. We crave it and boy is it delivered.

5253,"Even worse in more rural spots. The Scottish highlands are slowly dying because of it.

We've got low salaries because we're not in the city, so the rent increases are impossible to deal with. Seems like there's a new hotel shutting every week because they can't compete, and resturaunts are also closing too because a lot of people in Airbnbs will just cook their own meals rather than eat out like hotel guests do.

At this rate the Highlands are just going to be like Disneyland. No locals, no culture. Just tourist housing and gift shops.

Most highland towns will have at least 3x more AirBnBs to rent (full apartments) than actual houses to rent.

The CCP claims that they are conducting a legitimate counter-terrorism operation, that unlike Western ones, is (supposedly) non-violent and more constructive. It is clear that the concentration camps are not just vocational education schools that attempt to peacefully combat poverty and thus violent extremism and that serious abuses are happening there. It is also true that the CCP strongly dislikes religion (particularly of the ""foreign"" kind and when practiced by very devout people with a strong non-typical-Han-Chinese identity) and is worried about anything that threatens their precious ""harmony"".

Duda - current president (PiS Party) voters are as /u/JezusekChytrusek said mostly old churchgoers, poor jobless people hopping for another benefit and people from villages. Most of West Poland, young and educated people and people from big cities vote for Trzaskowski (PO Party). Both Parties they represent aren't ideal because it's duopoly always between those two parties. Under Duda's government there's been high rise in taxes aimed mostly at demographics of typical Trzaskowski's voters(""Netflix ""tax, Smartphone tax etc.)  at the same time he's basically buying votes with benefits like 500PLN for every kid, or 13th rent/pension. He also gave 2 billions to TVP public television, basically transforming it into his own North Korea-like propaganda tube. Most of old/poor folks don't have access to anything else or just don't watch any other news station because its so heavily ""advertised"" by priests in churches. It would take me ages to list every brainwashing attempt they tried on TVP but to name few:

\- Party members/fake mob asking prewritten questions  and using teleprompter on debate with ""normal, random citizens"". All those questions were highly  tendentious and sensational. 

\- So called TVP news trying to blame everything on Trzaskowski. Flood? Trzaskowski's fault. Bus crashed? Trzaskowski's fault.

\- Creating fake ""personas""  like ""world famous"" fashion designer Christian Paul who complimented First Lady's attire that's actually played by Krystian Farbaniec  - analytic..

\-Misquoting people in general to fit their ideology.

I agree that maybe we should strive to only have balanced posts on this subreddit.

And I think that there have been quite some one-sided anti-Turkish posts as well, so if this ""balanced"" policy is going to be adopted, it needs to be applied consistently and not just when it favors the anti-Turkish mob (and I am not that pro-Turkish myself, but there is plenty that can be criticized about Turkey while sticking to the facts and also looking at their point of view)",USA (from the Netherlands),/r/europe/comments/hlpyqf/in_2010_a_turkish_police_officer_named_ömer_akcan/fx5s5oy/,moon89286,1594084772

5373,"Reddit is filled with PiS haters so i'll try to sum it up as someone ""neutral""  
PiS acts like right wing conservative party, attracting nationalists and well... mostly uneducated people as shown by all the pools.  
The closer to German border the less PiS votes get and vice versa. Kinda funny tbh. Feels like the closer to ""civilization"" the less PiS popular is. + Warsaw, capital, PiS also isn't getting much votes there. Another city closer to civilization :D?  
Our country is filled with Catholics and well, most of them are anti lgbt and anti-immigration so PiS obviously does that.  
Though they were suposed to love one another, one of many of Poland's contradictions i guess

Yes, there are social programs and  they are a good thing, most of developed countries have them but they came under PiS ruling - which makes people say things like ""bought votes"" and hence PiS haters also hate such programs.  
Funny cuz most of the same people also despise Janusz Korwin Mikk e (a guy who would fire all the officials and revoke any social benefits there are)  
First of PiS programs was 500+, to encourage reproduction and fight bad birth rates.   
One thing i can  agree about with PiS haters is the newest  one,,which is 13th  pension for eldery ppl, it came just before election  so it really feels like buying people's votes. Though they revoked communist's high pensions/rent they had... and overall the  pension isn't great so it was a good thing to do, the moment to  implement it is kinda... you get it.   
There are good things and bad things, nothing really surprising imo. Thats how it is.  
Judging by more developed countries, who are supporting lgbt and immigration, social programs should also be okay, right? Thats  how it works in the ""better"" european countries.  
 PiS and PO (second guy's party) are living off people's hatered and they can't live without eachother. It seems like people who support each side, hate each other, forgetting about different options we can choose from.  
To me, it feels like some sort of masterplan. acting like worst enemies but actually making profit from all the commotion and hatred.

Our country has been steadily growing since joining EU  
It was growing under PO as it is now under PiS.  People seem to not really be aware of that, blinded by the politic schemes. At one hand I'm happy that polish people are working hard for a better future and on the other im surprised that the same people  get blinded so easily by all the politic stuff and they let themselves get way too absorbed into it.  


PiS hatters gonna say only bad things about PiS, and vice versa.

There is plenty of bad things to say about both of the parties.  
So much that i'm not gonna really get into it.   
Also we are on the internet so probably less uneducated ppl  here - gonna get smashed by PiS haters.   
its really hard to find someone unaffected by all of this and open minded in Poland right now (had few discussions already and i know that defending even a good thing made by PiS is just... pointless) its just blind hatred - thats what i dislike the  most about PiS and PO,  what  they did to ppl",,/r/europe/comments/hmg4ad/two_presidential_debates_in_poland_at_the_same/fx5sk7k/,osoichan,1594085009

5379,"&gt; I'm not criticizing who he goes for support but it's clear no one would support him if he didn't denounce slavery, which doesn't exclude that he did it to get support.

Fair enough.


&gt;That implies that European colonial powers colonized the world and abolished slavery wherever they went, that's not true at all, we used it for a very long time. In contrast Tibet has been part of China for more time in history than it has been independent and while independent it had slavery, a return to China meant the abolishment of slavery.

Yes, Tibet had been incorporated into the Qing Empire for a long time, but that doesn't necessarily mean they should own it forever. Ireland was under our rule for centuries, but they still became (and deserved to be) independent (and before anyone brings it up: I am in favour of a Scottish independence referendum).


That being said, I actually don't think Tibetan independence is a viable path for Tibet because if they were alone, they would just turn into a landlocked and impoverished statelet. But I don't support current CCP policies there either. Plus, China has a right to be concerned about control over it, Tibet covers a lot of land where their main rivers originate in. Ideally, China would be more like Germany or the USA and give them federal autonomy and all that good stuff, but that's obviously not going to be the case under a One Party state.",England,/r/europe/comments/hmc7f2/the_eu_must_oppose_chinas_interference_in_the/fx5sutc/,JeuyToTheWorld,1594085184

Would you call the British empire the Indian empire, just because most people in it were Indian and the ""King-Emperor"" was called the Emperor of India (or the Raj, whatever term)?

These were mostly Serbs and Montenegrins that settled in after Serbia occupied Kosovo in 1912. Most of them fleed during WWII because they were scared of revenge and rightly so, they were seen as newcomers . 

Partly Tito allowed some of them to return after the war, but most importantly Tito left Kosovo under the control of his police chief Aleksandar Ranković and so the programme of colonisation continued.

All in all over the course of the 20th century, Kosovo experienced four major colonisation campaigns that aimed at altering the ethnic population balance in the region, to decrease the Albanian population and substitute them with Montenegrins and Serbs.

5716,"&gt;Of course nowadays there are more tanks out there but for the next gen there won't. I'd consider Russian and Chinese tanks not an option and Korean / Japanese tanks not very likely for European militaries. That does not leave many options. Whatever the Americans will do, the MGCS and maybe one more European design. Though I guess current gen tanks will stay in service alongside those to some extend. So the transition will take long as the number shrinks a bit with each generation.

We will see what happens. Stuff like this often takes a long time and goes through many reviews.

&gt;After the Eurofighter / Rafale split I assume all FCAS parties know that carrier operations and nuclear armament have a high priority for France. So I would assume that is taken into account already.

Ancient armies mostly used basic tactics, quality of equipment, discipline and numbers were decisive factors, not novel genius tactics for the most part.

The early Roman armies often put themselves into incredible unfavorable tactical situations and used the most basic tactics and still won because of their cohesion, discipline and equipment. Often they didn't really win at all but just continued to fight and not surrender while other nations at the time surrendered and made deals instead of fighting to the last man. The punic wars are a good example of that, the romans essentially prevailed because of perseverance and adapting until they eventually defeated the enemy at great personal cost.

In the case of Alexander he had by far the greatest army of that time peroid at his disposal while the Persian empire was weak due to internal infighting.

5898,"I'm not sure what you're talking about tbh. None of what you described is considered to be luck. The Romans did indeed win the Punic wars despite receiving tremendous casualties because of their ability to replenish their forces (among other factors). 

Alexander has the heaviest army at the time, not exactly the greatest. When it comes to numbers he was severely outnumbered. He won because of his use of shock cavalry which repeatedly broke the enemy formation (his was actually the first recorded use of cavalry in that fashion). The Persian army did not lose 3 decisive battles because of any infighting. If anything the Greek armies are way more famous for their infighting as city states compared to an Empire like the Achaemenid empire. 

Charging the flank of the enemy line with cavalry isn't exactly a suicide charge. I mean it worked.. again and again. It stops being luck after a while. 

&gt;He could have easily been killed and with that his legend, how is this evidence of genius?

Except he didn't like a lot of his troops. He did get injured though more than once. Idk are you implying that every solider that survives battles is lucky? That's a weird notion. Then I guess every winning army is lucky according to you cause ""well they could have easily lost""..? 

And if you're arguing Alexander's genius when it comes to commanding and leading an army I'm not sure there's much of a point in debating this further.

5957,"&gt;In an opinion article published in the British newspaper The Independent, Fernando Medina argues that ""after the coronavirus, Lisbon will get rid of Airbnb and turn short-term vacation rentals into homes for essential workers"".  
&gt;  
&gt;The Mayor of Lisbon recognizes that, in recent years, the city has ""benefited a lot"" from the ""millions of tourists"", but that ""a social price has been paid"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Indicating that ""one third of the city center is occupied with vacation rentals"", Medina writes that ""essential workers and their families"" were forced to leave the city center due to high incomes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Enumerating some of the city's ideas for making this transformation process, Fernando Medina writes that this transition ""is a risky plan but it is not the only way to be used to reinvigorate the city center, where property prices have soared in the United States last year"".  
&gt;  
&gt;""We are working with private companies that are renovating some of the neglected buildings to ensure that it is possible to create affordable housing, which is very much needed.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Now we want to bring the people who are the life of Lisbon to the center of the city, at the same time that we make it greener, more sustainable and, ultimately, a better place for both living and visiting"".  
&gt;  
&gt;The president of CML, therefore, considers priority to be ""affordable housing for hospital workers, transport workers, teachers and thousands of other people who provide essential services"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Medina's message is still focused on sustainability: by ensuring that more people live in the city center, the CML president believes that there will be fewer trips, as ""city center residents can reach essential services (...) on 20-minute hikes "".  
&gt;  
&gt;""This approach will also help to tackle the climate crisis and improve public health,"" as ""denser cities mean fewer people moving to the center each day,"" writes Medina.  
&gt;  
&gt;In a note, Fernando Medina also underlines that ""none of this means that Lisbon did not want to receive tourists"", but that ""it is simply the way to do things differently and, ultimately, benefit visitors"".",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/hm62zv/after_covid19_lisbon_will_get_rid_of_airbnb_says/fx3g3y2/,Kiander,1594040807
