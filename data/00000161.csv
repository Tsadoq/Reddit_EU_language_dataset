1,"&gt;Actually you’re completely wrong again. You applied and got rejected.

You sound like a person seriously lacking education and trying to compensate. You pretty much copy-paste random paragraphs and try to be smart.

&gt;The Nordic Council and the Council of Ministers define Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Russia as ""Adjacent Areas"" and has formal cooperation with them under the Adjacent Areas policies framework; in recent years the cooperation has focused increasingly on Russia.

The EU also has similar ""adjacent areas"" *within* Europe.

&gt;The move was heavily opposed by the Soviet Union, accusing the Nordic Council of getting involved in its internal affairs.

6,"&gt;The word ""independent"" is mentioned only once on the entire Wikipedia page:

So?

&gt;And it's over domestic policy not the USSR.

Domestic policy, which in essence was freedom vs. being a Soviet puppet.

&gt;Also the words ""Nationalist"" and ""Nationalism"" are not used once in the article.

So, it's not always used for plenty of independence movements. Doesn't negate the fact that these were nationalist movements.

&gt;My opinion is based on the universal standard.

My opinion is based on education in the field.

&gt;You previously posted the Wikipedia page to nationalism and it didn't include the Prague Spring

The Wikipedia article on cities doesn't include my city. Am I therefore not living in a city?

&gt;acknowledge the breakup of Czechoslovakia 

What is there to acknowledge again?

&gt;How do you justify linking two completely separate political events with the same term?

Czechs and Slovaks were not really in a conflict, but one could indeed see the formation of two nation states as a nationalist issue.

&gt;How do you justify calling 1968 ""nationalist"" when a nationalist is by definition someone who wants to split Czechoslovakia into two.

9,"&gt;Finland also borders Sweden and isn’t Scandinavian.

So? Iceland is an island and doesn't border Scandinavia, yet is Nordic. Most of Finland's population lives across the sea from Sweden.

&gt;Finns however are in the Nordic council, and you aren’t.

Yes, because the Nordic Council was formed during the Cold War, when Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union.

&gt;Imagine wanting to be part of a club which most people don’t even recognise you to be part of. 

Most people everywhere are ignorant.

&gt;Just embrace your Eastern European roots man.

Why should I embrace the ignorant stereotypes of some random foreigners?

&gt;I identify as African, am I now African?

Yet you have probably nothing to do with Africa, Estonia has more to do with Nordic countries than with any other regional group.

&gt;Why would you self-identify as something a large percentage of people disagree with, lol.

No, a large percentage of foreigners disagree with. And it does make sense as their ignorant opinions are irrelevant as they usually know jack shit about Estonia and are stuck in ignorant and slightly xenophobic Cold War era stereotypes. As are you.

&gt;Completely wrong. Omg you’re so wrong on all of this. Finnish people are not Scandinavian (Germanic) they are not Scandinavian ethnically.

Of course they aren't. Did I claim this? And how was the Finnish part wrong again? You do understand that you are trying to teach me the basics of who our region is composed of. It's like I was trying to explain to you that the Welsh and Irish are Celtic people.

&gt;This is my whole point, language and ethnicity = different culture hence why Finns aren’t Scandinavian, Finnish language is not Germanic, and they are not of Germanic descent, this belongs to England, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Not Estonia or Finland.

Ethno-linguistic groups indeed have a strong influence on culture, but this is definitely not the only factor. English people are also related to Albanians and Armenians, yet I doubt you have that much common culture with them. Scandinavians have been in far stronger contact with Finns and Estonians and therefore the culture is more similar than with the English, who have been in stronger contact with the French.

&gt;I didn’t invent anything. This is just what most people know.

No, it's not. You are mistaking Germanic countries for Nordic countries.

I've disproved everything and it wasn't particularly difficult because your opinions are slightly xenophobic and not supported by any sources.

30,"From the other thread about the same topic:


You mean the same Red Army that just sat across the Vistula as the Warsaw Uprising was happening and did nothing but watch despite promising to help and trying to incite it to happen over radio?

The Soviet armies are near Vistula after battling for two months with the Army Group Centre, exhausted and in need of reinfocements, their supply lines are several hundred kilometers long. The Poles in Warsaw then recieve an order from their government in exile to start the uprising before the Soviets came, so that they would be in a better bartering position.

Here's how the Uprising has started:

Poles! This decisive moment of our heroic struggle will require readiness for sacrifices for our nation's sake. I order you the following: Bolsheviks are in front of Warsaw. They declare that they are friends of Polish people. This is an outrageous lie. Our outskirts, Vilno and Lublin demand revenge. Enemy Bolsheviks will meet with similar ferocity that undermined the spirit of the German occupants. All actions to help Russians are qualified as betrayal. The hour of Polish uprising is here! I cancel all the orders of Soviet collaborators. I ordered the commander of Army Krayova to suppress any attempts to help Soviets. Germans are fleeing. To the struggle with Soviets! Long live free Poland! Signed: Bur - Main Komendant of armed forces in Poland""

Why would the Soviets want to help the people who openly call them ""enemies""? Nevertheless, the Soviet forces - 2nd Tank Army, 47th Army - were sent to try and take some ground near/in Warsaw in the late July, they encountered the German's resistance.

48,"as stated, if rich people feel that taxes are too high, they'll simply look for ways to pay less, because the cost of finding ways to pay less in taxes is less than the tax itself, if the tax itself gets too high. This has happened, as I've stated, in France (Hollande's wealth tax) and more recently, in New York.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea of having as less taxes as possible is to have a competitive tax rate as compared to other nations since it helps in the growth of a country's economy. If you chase all the rich people and businesses away from your state/ country, who is going to provide investment? Who is going to provide jobs? My main jab at high taxes is that often, the government doesn't use it efficiently. Just look at America's spending on stuff like healthcare. America spends nearly 10.7 k per capita for healthcare, and spends 17.9% as a share of GDP on healthcare, which is a lot, and if i'm not wrong it's more than the military budget. Is the answer to America's healthcare woes to increase taxes and throw more money at healthcare? I really don't think so.

&amp;#x200B;

Well I'm not american! I'm from Singapore, and here we have rather low taxes (0%-22% on income, 7% GST, no inheritance tax no wealth tax yet). I'm definitely not wealthy, and here we have few social assistance programs (they're mostly for the poor). We do have some government subsidies I suppose, but mostly we pay out of this mandatory savings scheme (basically the government forces you to save a portion of your income for stuff like housing, healthcare and education), or we claim from insurance companies. And our public expenditure on healthcare is about 2.3k per capita. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-19/u-s-near-bottom-of-health-index-hong-kong-and-singapore-at-top](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-19/u-s-near-bottom-of-health-index-hong-kong-and-singapore-at-top)

&amp;#x200B;

And as mentioned previously in this comment, USA's mandatory spending is insane. USA spends like what, nearly 3 times of the military's budget on social security. Clearly it's not a problem of having too little money. It's a problem of really really poor management of money. And less taxes won't make your country crap. Less taxes promote productivity. After all, what is income tax but a tax on productivity? And do you really need the government to provide education? I really don't think so. In Singapore, we have this huge billion dollar tuition industry, providing education to young students who feel that the teachers in schools aren't good enough. As for infrastructure, I think a portion of it could be privatised, or at least I think it's best left to local governments, which I think is already the case for most of USA? I'm not too sure about that. As for social programs, maybe you need a government one for the really poor, but for others, I think leaving it up to charities, communities would be better (more efficient and better quality).

&amp;#x200B;

What is a well educated population really? 100% literacy rate? 100% with high school diploma? I think every idea has merit to it. Besides, didn't most people vote for Trump because he focused on jobs and illegal immigration reform? And besides, everyone thinks they're a 100% right. What makes you so sure your position isn't wrong? That is precisely why you need diversity of ideas. I'm pretty sure most people have the same goals. The question is what is the best way to get there.

&amp;#x200B;

If you increase taxes on the wealthy, the more productive individuals may decide ""screw it, I'm getting 30 cents out of every dollar i earn. I'm going to stop working then/ I'm moving away"". If you're wealthy, and considering that most wealthy people are self made, it means that society has decided that through market forces that your labour is more valued. And if you're punishing people for being productive, which is what income taxes and wealth taxes do, then you're going to end up with a less productive society. And i hardly think that majority of the people in USA don't contribute to the economy, The median income is about 2.6k per American in 2018. That's not a lot but it certainly isn't little. Didn't America get out of stagflation due to Reagan's economic policies? It's not that wealth is concentrated at the hands of few, after all isn't it the case that generational wealth hardly lasts? It shuffles from one hand to another. Besides, even with all hindrances from government, Americans still get wealthier as a whole. Wealth isn't finite after all.

&amp;#x200B;

Nah I believe government should still exist to protect property and individual rights, provide a military, police and civil defense. I mean limited in the sense that they shouldn't be able to have too many programs that balloon out of proportion. They shouldn't have the power to pass ridiculous laws. They should leave the economy alone. Politicians will still have plenty to vote for, but they just won't be able to have power to grant special privileges to businesses and people.

&amp;#x200B;

And it would seem to me that  Martin Shkreli 's actions were only possible because there are certain IP laws that can be abused in USA. So really, the government does have a part to play in that whole saga. Of course, people have to have their rights protected, and I definitely agree that that's one of the responsibilities of government.

2: no it doesn't lol atheists exist even though God exists. My first point is from the perspective that God exists, my second is that *if* He didn't there'd be no such thing as good and evil. Since we know there is, we know He exists. What is good or evil?

3: and Aristotle and Aquinas showed how these ideas are firmly connected to a God (and later Christian thinkers like Locke expounded). There's no source of universal rights or objective individual value outside of God. Where does objective value come from outside of God? (Objective value is necessary for universal rights so show that one and you'll show the other). If these ideas didn't need Christianity to be logically viable why did they not take root until Christian Europe? Why were Christian states the first to abolish slavery?

&gt;If you really believe that you need religion to do all that for you, it's because you lack the imagination and empathy to do it yourself.

111,"[Helvetii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetii) were Celts (who fought the Roman Empire and at some point teamed up with several Germanic tribes and other Celtic tribes for military campaigns into Roman territories). 

With the expansion of the Roman Empire and the ""occupation"" of many lands, a lot of Celts were romanized (culturally), in some regions more in others less (this goes for many regions in Europe). 

Then came the [Great Migration period](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lkerwanderung) where many Germanic tribes migrated and settled down all around Europe (in pretty much every Western, Southern and Central European country). 

In case of the Helvetiis lands (approximately Switzerland) it was the [Alemanni tribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alemanni) that settled down in what is now the German-speaking part of Switzerland, the [Burgundian tribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundians) in what is now mostly the French-speaking part of Switzerland and the [Lombard tribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombards) in what is now mostly the Italian speaking part of Switzerland. The reason why one part of Switzerland adopted a Germanic language (Swiss German, which is Alemannic German), while the others kept Romanic languages is probably because 1. the Helvetii (Celts) who lived in the now French and Italian speaking regions were probably stronger Romanized than the ones in what is now the German speaking part of Switzerland 2. The ratios between (mostly Romanized) Celts and new Germanic settlers were probably different (also it's probably worth mentioning that the migration of the Alemanni happened a lot later than the one of the Burgundi and the Lombardi, and thus under different conditions).",Switzerland,/r/europe/comments/bzqo9c/gods_of_europe/eqyuo8q/,thebiggreengun,1560389670

Well, if God does not exist I see no reason to think ""reason properly"" is even a thing, and it certainly isn't possible to know you can reason without God unless you had infinite knowledge but then you'd be God. That being said, I know I'm (and we, proper reasoning can't be done alone) capable of reasoning properly and coming to objective truths and this is because I was created to reason properly and in a universe in which reasoning properly leads to understanding and truth.

157,"&gt;For instance, people can't claim that the holocaust didn't happen, or  they can't encourage hate, racism, nazism, call for violence or murder,  or spread footage or images depicting actual violence...

&amp;#x200B;

This is not true at all. What on earth leads you to believe that harmful ideologies are more contained? To the contrary, when you suppress free speech you promote harmful ideologies. By prosecuting Le Pen for this she had been made into a martyr and the state loses the moral high ground to her. All it does it cause her to gain sympathy.

216,"Unlike you, I do not want the world to be in WW3. THAT WOULD BE THE END OF THE WORLD. But yes, it absolutely could be started because of Serbia invading the independent sovereign nation of Kosovo. WWI was started because a terrorist Serb assassinated Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo. Someone who modern day Serbs revere as a hero btw, which is hilarious and horrific, considering the actions of that one terrorist Serb. 

Serbia is backed by Russia. Kosovo is backed by the US. The US &gt; Russia, capitalism &gt; socialism. The US is the big dick in all of this. As the US goes, so does the world go. Germany answers to the western nations, not to Russia, that's ridiculous. Regardless, again, as long as Serbians aren't going to be idiots and try to invade Kosovo, they won't start WW3. Which is why I questioned you in the first place, because Serbians in general don't accept the clear fact that Kosovo is a sovereign nation with a government that rules over its own people, elected officials, borders around its boundaries, and recognition by OVER HALF of the international community. There are more countries in the world that recognize Kosovo than there are that don't, including the big dick USA. Clearly that is something that Serbians do not grasp and is something they are bitter about, but it is the fact of the matter. International Law backs them, and coupled with the backing of the most powerful nations in the world, Kosovo is on the correct side in this matter. Serbians will cry boo hoo, and Russia and China will oppose the US because they are playing their own geopolitical games, which neither Serbia nor Kosovo are actual players of. Both are pawns, and Kosovo is a pawn on the right winning side while Serbia is a pawn on the losing, communist side, like always. Democracy and capitalism will prevail, as they are undoubtedly the best ideologies ever. 

The US is still by far the strongest superpower. It has the most diversified economy and is the greatest country to live in still. China has done a lot to catch up, but they are still inferior to the US, and they are still communist and led by a dictator, which history shows always ends up the same way. Right now, Russia is mostly playing misinformation games, the US is balancing being a world leader, a race to creating Artificial General Intelligence against China, and fighting inner turmoil that is caused by misinformation which is led by Russia and China. China is mostly focused on the AI race, with a big focus on manufacturing and abundant supply of natural resources and homogeneous human capital, and is working to expand their influence in Africa, but again, they are communist and are experiencing growth because they've opened up their economy to be more market based. They will suffer during the coming economic recession, and while the US will also suffer, the US still has a diversified economy and China will suffer worse. Not to mention the fact that South Korea and Japan are both in Asia and both competing against China. 

Regardless of all this, the US still absolutely has interests in Europe and there is definitely a reason they back Kosovo. Again, the US is the big swinging dick, they make the rules, whether you like it or are willing to recognize it. They are the reason Kosovo is a country and independent of Serbia, you're on the wrong side buddy 🤣",,/r/europe/comments/bzpldm/today_prishtina_marked_its_20_years_of_liberation/eqyf92z/,XWingataliciousness7,1560382341

Who cares about Belarus or its balancing act between East and West? Belarus is basically a non-country that can't stand on its own feet. Poland is a serious country.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Belarus is indefinitely more worthwhile for Russia than Poland is for the US. Just look at a map, for once.

&amp;#x200B;

Look at a map yourself. South Korea is infinitely more worthwhile for North Korea than the US on the other side of the world, but that hasn't stopped US from keeping 20,000 troops there for the last 70 years to defend it from North Korea. West Germany was infinitely more worthwhile for the USSR than for the US across the Atlantic, but that didn't stop the US from keeping 400,000 troops in West Germany throughout the entire Cold War. You really think the US deploys forces abroad based on political geography?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The US likes Poland and has good relations with Poland because the Poles take a hard line and seem ready to fight. Same reason that the US likes Israel so much.

&gt;Trump planing to move the forces from Germany and plant them in Poland  is another issue to consider. It's going to further reinforce the belief  in Germany, and other western European nations, that the US is not a  reliable partner.

290,"there are lots of arguably better shows in every of your category than the ones you listed.

the ones you listed are just the ones with the most action and mainstream appeal.

i'd argue that when it comes to your hbo shows, the wire still absolutely dwarfs game of thrones (and possibly every other show) in terms of quality. probably not mass phenomenon, but still.

same goes for cable tv shows. sopranos is, at least in my personal opinion, vastly superior to breaking bad as well. breaking bad is pretty much sopranos, but instead of focussing on character development first and foremost, the focus lies on the action. which might make for a better spectacle, but also makes everything else fall flat in comparison. which is also why i personally much prefer even better call saul to breaking bad. downtown abbey or mad men also absolutely deserve a shout. or even the shield if you really prefer your show to have lots of action focus.

and for mini-series there are just too many really good ones to proclaim bob as ""the best"". both seasons of american crime story make a strong case for themselves. so does true detective season 1 or even older miniseries such as pride and prejudice, generation kill and north and south. season 1 of fargo is potentially also worth a shout.

breaking bad and especially game of thrones are this tv generations heroes and lost. great shows with mass appeal. but not good enough to make a serious case for ""best tv show"". but i guess thats a highly debateable topic that depends massively on your own personal taste. which is why it irks me so much that there are so many people like yourself that paint it as a two option choice between bb and got.",,/r/europe/comments/bzqa0g/chernobyl_has_become_imdbs_highestrated_series/eqyhg9i/,joergboehme,1560383358

Fox News for example, half the country is Republican so any cable provider that doesn't have Fox News would alienate half of its customers and lose them to a cable provider that has Fox News.

The cable channels know where they stand in the pecking order, so the more popular ones will charge an arm and a leg to the cable provider, and the cable provider will pass that cost on to the consumer. Occasionally the cable provider will balk at the cost and there will be a blackout of that channel and it will be a game of ""wait and see"" before one side blinks first.

After the 50 most popular channels there are some lesser known channels. Some cable providers will have them others won't.

317,"&gt; This is Reddit. Hardly a proper forum for intelligent argumentative  conversation. More a platform for jokes and memes. I made a joke. I got  some fake internet points for it. Yay. 

My bad to think that we can't have a proper argumentative conversation, while everyone else does on the specific post, because we're on reddit.

Also you didn't make a joke. You made an ad hominem type of insult in order to diminish my statement. Specifically you implied that I was a communist hence via the ad hominem logical falacy my statement was invalid. It is very common practice when the other party has no argument but it rarely comes in the form of sarcasm.

&gt; Furthermore, I do believe that sarcasm has a place in intelligent  argumentative conversation. A very strong place in fact, as evidenced by  Socrates, one of the founding fathers of Western philosophy and also  incredibly fond of sarcasm. 

I'm Greek. Do not talk to me about Socrates and founding fathers of Western philosophy. We're getting them taught at school at the age of 14. Socrates had a known character flaw. It does not validate the use of sarcasm instead of arguments. It never did. It is illogical. It is as stupid as saying that drunkenness has a place in dialectics because Plato was often drunk.

&gt; I did not assume anything. I called you 'comrade' because as I said, I  was making a joke and the 'comrade' appellation is critical for that  joke to work.   
&gt;  
&gt; Furthermore, it is wrong of you to assume that I assume that you are a  communist just because I call you comrade. Plenty of non-communist  leftists and even some radical right-wing groups address one another as  comrade. 

This is plain sophistry, since you like Greek philosophy. I already explained what you did and it is evident there for everyone to read. You clearly called me comrade in a sarcastic way which is the common derogatory way to insult a communist. It is not an assumption. It is used in every day speech and we read and hear it everywhere used by fascists, neoliberals and capitalists. You continued with the re-education camps. What you said literally translates to: ""Righto communist, you would send me to a re-education camp like you all commies do."" implying that my statement was communist propaganda instead of the fact that it is. I did not assume anything. It is clearly there. If I tell you good day you are not assuming a greeting. It is a greeting.

&gt; Why are you suggesting that there could be a relation between communism  and re-education camps? I never said anything like that! Are you  implying that people could think such a preposterous thought? Report to  the political commissar at once! 

And here you are doing almost the same thing again. You are using sarcasm to validate your previous statement without an argument. People DO think that re-education camps are a feature of communism as a result of propaganda.

&gt; Dumb political jokes aside, there definitely is an association between  communism and re-education camps, courtesy of the Soviet Union, China,  North Korea and other socialist regimes in the 20th and 21st centuries. I  agree that there is not necessarily a relation between communism and  re-education camps. I have read Marx and Engels, and there is no mention  of re-education camps anywhere. Re-education camps are a feature of  totalitarian regimes (regardless of ideology), not of communism. 

Indeed they are a feature of totalitarian regimes and not of communism which is NOT a totalitarian regime.

&gt; Why are you assuming that I haven't read Marx and Engels, by the way?  After all, assumptions have no place in intelligent conversation  according to you, comrade pot-and-kettle! 

Again I am not assuming anything. If you had actually read you would not continue to insist the things that you do later on this post (eg China -- I will get to that point specifically) and you would accept my original statement of a fact, which you don't.

&gt; China literally is ruled by a communist party that calls its ideology  socialism, constantly talks about the need to uphold Marxist principles,  has an entire government department whose task it is to ensure that  everyone sticks to Marxist ideology, claims to be on the road towards  communism etc. etc.   
&gt;  
&gt; But no! Disregard that whole so-called communist party and all their  so-called Marxist ideologists! Here is a random guy on the internet who  says that they aren't communist at all! Surely his opinion is way more  important and his definition of communism the only one and true! 

The fact that it is ruled by a self-proclaimed communist party has nothing to do with what it applies. As an example the Syriza party here in Greece also claims to be communist but its policies are right-wing to the core and contrary to any definition of communism. Claiming that I am the Pope does not make me the Pope now, does it?

The facts are these: In a communist regime there is no state. Means of production are directly controlled by the people. There is no state ownership of anything. Does China fall under this description? Of course it doesn't. Does China's state control 100% of the means of production? Yes it does. Does it exploit, manipulate and invest capital? Yes, it does. So by definition it is a capitalist country. Has any country in our world history ever applied anything that collides with the definition of communism? No there hasn't.

So it's not some random guy on the internet saying so. It's political sciences. It's the definitions of said terminology saying so. What the random guy on the internet is doing is informing you of it. Of something that you are obviously ignorant at. See why I did not assume that you have not actually read on the subject? Because if you had you would simply not say the things that you do. Unless of course you lack the capacity to understand it but, by your use of the language, you don't come off as a simpleton. This is called deductive logic and is something entirely different than assumption which is what you did with your initial ad hominem.

&gt; I can afford a proper education without money just fine. Government  gives you a loan for the tuition. You can pay it back later when you get  a well-paying job. Sure, liberal capitalists are always trying to  restrain access to education by making it more expensive, but most  countries also have strong socialist parties that can prevent that. 

You can't get student loans if you are already in debt. And in most cases, with the cost of education a student load is not even nearly enough. Not to mention unemployment rates prevent you from ever paying it. Over here PhD graduates are flipping burgers and working delivery service. Socialist parties prevent nothing if they are not in power. Although most parties, even self proclaimed socialists are actually corrupt. That last part is my own personal perception and of course not presented as fact. I'm sure somewhere there must be a few decent, non-corrupt politicians that are not just interested in lining their pockets but I've yet to see them or hear about them.

&gt; And, no. Religion doesn't all boil down to education. There are lots of  highly educated religious people. Loss of religion is much more  complicated than just education. Education also does not necessarily  make people less stupid or less likely to believe propaganda and parrot  third-party sources. Plenty of highly educated people who do just that,  and also plenty of highly educated people who are just plain stupid,  despite being obviously intelligent. 

But it does. There's direct correlation. Education does not just mean a uni degree. It implies actual culture and ability for critical thought which indeed prevents people from believing stupid things and propaganda without doing proper research and applying critical thinking.",,/r/europe/comments/bzefy1/christianity_as_default_is_gone_the_rise_of_a/eqxxehm/,Tanthul,1560375018

So, a few facts about Kalinin:

 Kalinin was a factional ally of Stalin during the bitter struggle for power after the death of Lenin in 1924 ;  Kalinin was one of comparatively few members of Stalin's inner circle springing from peasant origins. The lowly social origins were widely publicised in the official press, which habitually referred to Kalinin as the ""All-Union headman"" 

 In practical terms, by the 1930s, Kalinin's role as a decision-maker in the Soviet government was nominal. 

 He held little power or influence beyond receiving diplomatic letters from abroad. Recalling him, future Soviet leader [Nikita Khrushchev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev) said, ""I don't know what practical work Kalinin carried out under Lenin.

334,"&gt; Fair enough, but as I said, that only makes the system even worse.

But how? It, like burden-sharing in general, is a measure to relieve entry points of pressure.

Let's assume a number of, say, 500.000 applicants. You already know more than half of them will be rejected, but obviously they still have to go through the whole process. Splitting this number up into smaller contingents and allocating them to the other Member States makes it easier for the entry point to deal with the influx, without placing undue burden on the other states. As an added bonus, the reduction in pressure should also result in each asylum seeker being processed faster, due to a smaller queue and a smaller backlog. This in turn speeds up confirmation (allowing the asylee to enter the job market and undergo other integration measures) or deportation (which will still be slow due to lack of cooperation of many destination countries, but every little helps).

&gt; On the other hand with NS2, Poland has to trust Russia (not Germany!) because it wont be up to Germany if they will have the gas to supply Poland/EE.

Ah, I think I understand what you mean now. In essence, you fear that NS2 would implement a bypass that would allow Russia to cut off countries which it currently would not.

I can see the dilemma. From what I recall reading, Russia has been a rather reliable supplier even in times of the Cold War, when the Soviet Union would export gas to West Germany and France. Then again, I actually consider the Soviet Union to have been more predictable than Putin's Russia is right now -- not to mention the Gazprom investigation you linked (notice how it was the EU that raided their offices! :p).

I'd say that the EU could, in case of emergency, repurpose the existing infrastructure to ration its gas and supply Poland, essentially reversing the flow, but this goes back to your lack of trust in the EU (specifically: other Member States' willingness to cut back on their own consumption to keep Poland ""on life support""), so the point is moot. At least I can see better where you are coming from on that topic now.

As for the non-EU Eastern European countries, the situation arguably is a mess. Russia is abusing its monopoly; hopefully the mid-term consequence will be that everyone jumps ship. Sad that it has come to this, talking as a globalist, but I don't think the current Russian administration is a reliable partner. I recall you mentioned Poland already having plans to achieve energy independence -- good call.

&gt; An example of double standards.

Well, that comment was as bluntly honest as it was disappointing. I suppose there is too much leeway going on, although I'm not sure this has to do so much with double standards rather than the EU being afraid to kick up dust.

362,"&gt;Even if that were the case, that doesn't make it wrong.

Very true, the common metaphor is trying to walk on a frozen lake. Our faith, method of investigation or degree of certainty have no bearing on whether or not the ice can hold a person's weight. So if the vast majority of people trust science for bad reasons this does not make science untrustworthy... but it does make the arguments from people who proport to be interested in only rational thought to be suspect. 

&gt;I must disagree with the skepticism of science.

I'm not skeptical of science. I am skeptical of the understanding of science which people use to try to argue against Christianity. I my college degree included several philosophy of science classes (I got my BA in philosophy) and my post-grad studies were in educational psychology which includes many classes devoted to research-based solutions. I have no problem with science at all and find no contradiction between the rigorous study of the natural world and belief in something above the natural world. 

&gt;But its religious side has weakened dramatically and continues to do so, in both Europe and USA. This has ended up with more and more people no longer nominally identifying as Christian. Majority of Europeans do not believe the Bible to tell the truth anymore. And hey, that's like the topic of this original post.

I understand that Christianity is declining in Europe (and the urban parts of the US) but this is nothing new. Christianity has been ""in decline"" all of its history. At the crucifixion of Christ those in power thought they had that issue settled and then an explosion of growth. When that didn't work there were centuries of repression, and then it becomes the official religion of the Roman empire. The rise of Islam left Christianity in only the backwater Western portion in its poverty and then Christianity spread to every continent on the world. The rise of secularism put the church out of power and yet still it grows. And yeah it is currently declining in the weird^1 parts of the world but along with Islam is the only ideology which is growing faster than the population rate. So while I understand the position of the post: Christianity is declining in Europe (and that is the most important place in the world). But my original response still stands: if Christ is on the throne then His Kingdom is in no danger from tends and forces of our current circumstances.

He calls Kosovo - Kosova and calls Albanians Albanian-Illyrians...that's not unbiased. 

&gt;I never said you guys weren't, but my point was the amount of Serbs in those areas increased significantly when you guys migrated there during the Austro-Ottoman Wars and you guys use that excuse with Kosovo for us too.

That's a population transfer, not a colonization. 

&gt;here was a large amount of Albanians living in Kosovo prior to the invasion like in the document above.

No, there was not. Barely any households of Albanian origin were recorded. 

&gt;Christian Albanians such as Leke Dukagjini, Gjergj Pelini, Pjeter Bogdani, Pjeter Mazreku, etc. were all born in Kosovo during the 15-17th centuries.

Yes, and the Ottomans invaded in the 15th century, hence my point. 

&gt;. Toponyms such as Arbanska and Djake show an Albanian presence during the Middle Ages.

Depends on the century, could have gained them later.

&gt;The Decani Chyrsobulls and the 1455 Brankovic defter also show an Albanian presence,

Yes, a few houses, not any meaningful pressence, there were more Saxons under Tsar Dusan in Serbia than there were Albanians in Kosovo. 

&gt; these two censuses are very unreliable as they were done in the Middle Ages and determining everybody's ethnicity was practically impossible unlike today

Then how did they record those few houses?
Languages and cultures were different even then, not to mention names and such. 

&gt;Even IF we did settle after, that does not mean we are colonizers in the era. Populations in Europe have been changing over the centuries. It's stupid to just say somebody is not native here because their great great great grandfather's cousin's brother was not from this region.

But it's not, if she insists we are colonizers, great, but then so are you, and at an even later date. If she doesn't, i don't give a crap who came when. 

&gt;Well, you guys obviously were in the area prior and during that. I believe their point is that the Yugoslav/Serb government was trying change the demographics of Kosovo on purpose by sending random Serbs/Montenegrins to settle the area.

Art.2: *""'applicant' means a third-country national or a stateless person who has made an application for international protection in respect of which a final decision has not yet been taken""*

""Clear need of international protection"" is defined in Article 3, where the document limits the scope of relocation to applicants from specific nationalities.

Well, I can only say that neither should be an issue -- when stuff flows from one point to another, to some degree you just *have* to trust the other party that they will keep up their end of the bargain.

Why should Germany just take its cut without any consideration of other Member States connected to the line? Are you sure you're not just projecting your ""my country first"" thinking here? Did Germany do something like this in the past?

&gt; I dont mean to be rude, but idealistic often means naive, especially when we are talking about politics and business on the highest level.

Sure, just as realistic often just means pessimist, depending on one's perspective and past experiences. But the way I see it, the European project is founded at least as much on ideals as it is on ""coincidentally"" mutual beneficient agreements, otherwise our Charter of Fundamental Rights wouldn't be so progressive. At some point, one just has to have faith in a better world, else it gets difficult to work towards it.

&gt; double standards (for example: ""because its France""), doing things against the will of the people (Article 13)

There was a lot of activism surrounding Article 13, and much of it influenced by a certain megacorp, but I'm not sure we can predict ""the will of the people"" when there's been no referendum. Admittedly, and you will probably disagree vehemently with me on this, I'm actually feeling good that there wasn't, because there was so much misinformation going on that it would've been a self-inflicted wound much like Brexit. The UK had their red bus, we had ""memes will be banned"".

If you want, we can engage in a bit of a debate about Article 13 -- you wouldn't be the first user I managed to convince after quoting from the *actual document* that was voted on. A lot of opponents of the Directive do not seem to know the actual text itself, but only what some other person claimed it says, often involving quite a bit of misrepresentation. The biggest lack of awareness seems to surround what I like to call the counterweight clause, which gives uploaders a legal right to availability of content exempted from copyright. This is more than what you can demand of YouTube today.

What's that about France, though?

&gt; Great, so lobbyist instead of having to lobby in 28 countries can do that in one place :)

Well, technically speaking you'd still have to lobby 28 countries, as those make up the Council. Or the several hundred MEPs, depending on which angle you'd try.

It's a bit like with foreign relations like trade: the larger the bloc and the more complex its organization, the more difficult it becomes to influence from the outside. This includes lobbyism. Just from looking at the Directives the EU has managed to pass, such as GDPR or Net Neutrality, which Big Tech also heavily lobbied against, it appears to me that we are on the right track compared to, say, the US and what goes on in Washington. We are far from perfect, mind you, but we're doing better than most.

It's probably a bit ironic that I would also mention Article 13 as an example here: not even Google gets to dominate ""us"".

So you're saying that if you were unable to marry a woman, you'd feel compelled to rape some kids?

More to the point, there's zero evidence to indicate that celibacy requirements increase child sex abuse, and no evidence that Catholic priests abuse children at higher rates than Protestant or other clergy that are allowed to marry. In fact, the available evidence indicates that they abuse at slightly lower rates than teachers.

474,"&gt;Some 'scientist', early on, tried to explain away a mammoth skull discovered (without its tusks) and concluded that based on the similarity to the human skull, and the proportion, that in an earlier age, humans that were much taller and stronger lived (and before you crow; consider the dinosaurs and its modern cousin emph cousin, the lizard).  Then he explained away their collapse by a ""war with the gods"" (locked away) - is zeus throwing a lightning bolt from olympus fundamentally any different than a meteor strike I wonder?).  Is this so different than science?

Mistakes of scientists, false claims (not all scientists are the same), as well as errors of science, do not negate its value whatsoever. Science acknowledges to make mistakes because it is dependent on evidence available and humans ""putting the picture together"". It's fundamentally different from religion because if enough evidence builds against a theory, it will be rejected.

&gt; There is nothing special about science. 

Science is actually very special and of utmost importance to modern human civilization. Science is why we live so long and healthy nowadays, why we have access to such modern technology, why we don't burn ""witches"" etc. That doesn't mean it's perfect and source of all the good. It can, and has been used for bad as well.

&gt; ... because looking for proof, doesn't work; just, disproof. that is you can always find something to confirm your thinking. 

That is called anecdotal evidence and can be rejected if it's obvious it isn't part of a bigger pattern. For example, if I have 19 people claiming X happened but one claiming Y happened, it is very likely that X happened and Y is merely mistaken/lying/confused. It's also, to a very small extent, possible that the 19 people are mistaken/lying/confused, though. When the ratio goes to something like 1999-1 and higher, it becomes closer and closer to what we would consider a fact.

&gt;In essence, I am suggesting, you look towards disproof. That is, put yourself in a position, to discover you might be in error; then look to see what new insights you can derive, what corrections to a world-view you can enact, based on said disproof. 

But I don't think I wouldn't be open to disproof. However, when there's piles of evidence for something and only very little against, one can outweigh the other to such a degree that we can still have confidence for the supported view.

&gt;Ah my friend, this is a problem with your logical thinking -- you have conflated the convention of ""the burden of proof relies on the person making the positive statement"" with a *requirement to do so*. 

The ""burden of proof"" in the scientific context definiley lies on those who make a new claim. Nobody is required to give it but they can't expect others to believe them without doing so. 

&gt; In fact, at least under logical systems, a statement must specifically be disproved, to be false. 

That's because the logical system are an abstract thinking of their own. You rely on assumptions and there's not much to do with proofs. 

In scientific thinking, you need to back up claims because it does not operate in an abstract world, it operates in the real world, which is often so much more complicated.

&gt; You have taken the doctrine of the excluded middle, and presumed that since it is not true, it must be false. 

If something is not true, it is, by definition, false. How could it be interpreted in any other way?

&gt;to presume that you cannot prove a negative 

A small [article](http://www.tiaztikt.nl/can-you-prove-a-negative-or-how-to-prove-a-negative/) on it, with a following paragraph:

*If I claim that God exists, that he is allmighty, that he doesn’t interfere with the material world we are living in (tho’ he could if he wanted to), that he cannot be detected by any modern equipment, that he is invisible and cannot be seen or identified with any of our senses, or by any animals sense, then you cannot prove he doesn’t exist.*

&gt; Or more simply; how can you know its NOT raining outside? 

If I don't have any proof that would indicate either, I don't. But I see where you want to take this and it doesn't work. I know what outside weather might look like, I've observed it for a significant part of my life. That's why I can be undecided about rain or not, but if somebody claimed it was raining blue fireballs, I would require proof and would be, by default, sceptic.

&gt;For centuries it was (in English) a common phrase to indicate an unlikely, improbable or impossible event with the phrase ""a black swan"" (because it was ""known"" all swans are white); and yet black swans exist, independent of the knowledge of the speaker, or listener. 

Again, people get more evidence and our knowledge changes all the time. That's an essential part of science. Science does not claim to lead to absolute truth all the time and as I already wrote, admits to make mistakes. That's because it relies on evidence and people interpreting, both with their limitations. Science, however, is very likely to reflect the reality. Unlike religion which is fictional and operates more on a ""a broken clock is right twice on a day"".

&gt;Yet have you actually sat down, with Christians in a bible study, tracing back the etymology of words through multiple languages to correct for such mistranslations? 

No and simply put, that's because I lack even the basic trust for the Bible as already its first sentences are rather simplistic fictions that are very easily debunked. You can't turn the Genesis' creation of the world into anything that would even remotely resemble the scientific understanding simply because it's not just abstract that would allow some creative interpretations, it makes so many false claims that makes it impossible.

&gt;Join. You won't be an outsider; and your critique may actually have merit. Religion has always been a moral and ethical system first and foremost. A persuasive argument, can change a mind.

I can't join a system I believe is fictional. I could claim to do so, but really I wouldn't believe a word of it. I would also be unwilling to follow a large part of the moral norms in the Bible, but then so again majority of Christians are. I just see the hypocrisy in that.

&gt;christianity exists and provides value to countless others. this would indicate, there is some skew with regard to your belief structure, with the world 

Religion has played a huge role in any civilization, that's for sure. Then again, that's, in a way, an argument against Christianity because other regions and eras have had other religions that have stilled fulfilled the same function, indicating there's no ""the one true religion"".

&gt;Quite the opposite. You are German?

No, Estonian.

&gt;The body is temple to the soul; a fit body, means a fit mind - therefore is it crazy to insist on regular light exercise, before one goes to bed, to heal?

People know that exercising is healthy and they can choose a suitable way to do it. Just replace crouching with... kneeling on frozen peas for 20 minutes. 

&gt;... and you could have chosen to follow a serial killer, taking you to the scene of the crime, and your eventual dismemberment. ;) your evaluation of risk, does not actually corral risk.

Yes, but I made a decision based on my perception of the risk.

&gt; and yet you might land in a garbage bin, and break nothing. 

I could convince myself of the garbage bin being there. Religion is more akin to the sudden wings – something that sounds nice and is used in fiction a lot, but there's no proof whatsoever.

&gt;Many of the greatest minds in science &amp; math, were religious. They did not see a fundamental conflict between science and religion; and yet you insist, there is...

Firstly, there's somewhat been a change in societies. In the past, being religious and scientist was quite common, partly because people had less knowledge and partly because they faced immense pressure. Secondly, science does not exclude religion by default. It does, however, refute many of the claims made by religion (religious texts, religious people).",Eesti,/r/europe/comments/bzefy1/christianity_as_default_is_gone_the_rise_of_a/eqxeyud/,toreon,1560368426

HBO, Netflix and other services: Can be written however the writers see fit.

Miniseries: Doesn't need filler content, doesn't need to maintain momentum over dozens of episodes, can have a predetermined conclusion from the very first episode.

That's what people said before Chernobyl. And Fukushima. But the danger lies not with all the things that we have considered, it lies with the things that we have not; the ""unknown unknowns"", to borrow a phrase. 

From an engineering perspective no system is failureproof. It is merely a matter of how small you can make the error rate, which is also subject to economic considerations, but it will still be strictly greater zero. And no matter how small that number is, if you multiply it with a sufficiently long time period, something is eventually going to happen. Mix in the inevitable dose of human error, and it is not a question of if the next nuclear accident is going to happen, but when. Might be tomorrow, might be in 100 years, but eventually it is going to.

633,"&gt; Blaming Poland for the unwillingness and failure of other members to fulfill their migrant quotas is bull. Thats just a cheap excuse.

Only if you don't want to recognize a connection between Poland refusing to take in even a single migrant under the scheme, and other countries subsequently falling short of their commitments.

We can and probably should agree to disagree about this bit, as there's not much else to discuss after having made our perspectives clear.

&gt; That wouldnt have solved anything. The migrants wouldnt have stayed in their ""new homes"" and would have left for countries like Germany, just like so many of them did.

[The majority of asylum applications are rejected](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Asylum_statistics#Decisions_on_asylum_applications), and until their application has been processed they are the responsibility of the registering state. If they'd go elsewhere during this time, they would just be sent back as per the Dublin Regulation's take-back clause, Article 18.1 (""Obligations of the Member State responsible"").

For those that have successfully been granted asylum, of course Freedom of Movement does apply. And what is supposed to be the problem for Poland, in that case? I thought we were discussing an unwillingness to host refugees.

&gt; I dont blame Germany for doing whats best for Germany, but than no one else should be surprised when Poland does whats best for Poland. You cant have it both ways.

You are equating failure of adherence to previously agreed-upon treaties with countries looking for alternatives within the framework of ordinary politics. You are equating an *expectation* of apparently eternally continued transit fees for an unreliable gas route with the question of how to best resolve a humanitarian crisis.

Heck, if the EU isn't pumping enough money into Poland already, you could just ask for more and tie this to an offer to take in more refugees as part of a compensation scheme. Win-win? Especially if they'd just leave for another EU country, as you said yourself.

&gt; How is that showing solidarity with other EU members?

Solidarity does not mean an *entitlement* to transit fees for what should arguably be a voluntary transaction between two third party states. You make it sound more like blackmail than a service charge.

&gt; Irrelevant or are you saying ""you pay, we obey"", is that the sort of union of ""equal"" members we are part of?

I'm saying EU membership comes with both privileges *and* obligations. You can't start cherrypicking and then complain about getting called out over it.

And yes, I'm sure the German economy benefited quite a bit from the larger market. But I'm not arguing from a corporate point of view, I am interested in the cohesion of Member States and maintaining the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and worried about the long-term consequences of national egoism eroding both.

&gt; Sure, everything gets exaggerated these days (for clicks, as a political tools, etc), but for example France having 2 year emergency state and then basically legislating it, doesnt seem like a small issue.

It kinda does when looking at the [actual amount of attacks and victims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism_in_Europe#List_of_attacks) over the years. Maybe what should be questioned was whether the extensions were truly necessary or part of an overreaction, as interior ministries and conservative parties in *many* countries are quick to push for more security measures following large profile terrorist attacks. Doesn't mean that something like the US' Patriot Act is truly in the best interests of EU citizens.

Terrorism is here to stay, anyways, regardless of whether you allow asylum or not. It's not like asylum seekers arrive with AK-47s in their backpacks; many terrorists these days are ""home-grown"" (read: disenfranchised) and both weapons and people get smuggled across the border. The current media environment provides the best incentive for terrorist groups to stage an attack -- it is only by giving up on our civil liberties and humanitarian concerns that they actually ""win"".",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bzoh94/polands_twofaced_immigration_strategy/eqw610d/,akashisenpai,1560353515

785,"&gt; So the disagreement is only for the attribution, correct ? Whether western morality is from Christianity versus from Paganism ?

No, I'm absolutely not saying that Western morality comes from paganism. ""Paganism"" doesn't even really exist, it's a catch-all term for hundreds of polytheistic religions and mythologies. I'm saying that our most basic moral rules (don't kill, harm, or steal from your neighbours without provocation) are not unique to Christianity or to any other religion or philosophy, they're shared by almost all humans worldwide, regardless of which religion they follow. They're intrinsic to humanity, and they come from the natural instincts we evolved so as to be able to co-exist and cooperate with the other members of our society. Many social primates also have a concept of fairness and property. If a chimp, even a low-ranking one, finds a banana he can usually be relatively sure that nobody will steal it from him; even high-ranking members of the group rarely steal, and when they do it hurts their social standing.",,/r/europe/comments/bzefy1/christianity_as_default_is_gone_the_rise_of_a/eqvlbsr/,Yeshu_Ben_Yosef,1560346626

824,"&gt;WARSAW—The Catholic Church in Poland has seen an uptick in accusations from people claiming to have been sexually abused by clergy as children, after a YouTube video sparked public anger at an institution that is at the political and social heart of this culturally conservative country.

&gt;The upsurge appears to have been prompted by the two-hour-long YouTube documentary about sexual-abuse allegations against Polish clergy, entitled “Tell No One,” which has been viewed more than 22 million times. Victims’ advocates say the film has shifted the mood in a country that, they argue, has been slow to address allegations of clerical sex abuse.

&gt;Since then, at least 21 people have stepped forward with new allegations, according to local church officials contacted at 24 of Poland’s 41 dioceses. Officials at the remaining dioceses didn’t return calls or emails, or declined to discuss the subject.

&gt;A local victim’s support group, Don’t be Afraid, said it had received over 100 emails detailing such accusations since “Tell No One” went online, though the group hasn’t yet determined how many of them were previously unknown.

&gt;“What we can certainly say is that we are dealing here with an increased number of people reporting cases of sexual abuse,” said Przemysław Śliwiński, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of Warsaw, which declined to put a number on the new cases. Another church spokesman said each diocese responsible for one of the clergy named in the film has appointed a delegate to review the film and see if there should be a formal investigation.

&gt;The public outcry has raised the possibility that Poland could follow the path of Ireland, where revelations of widespread sexual and physical abuse by priests and church employees has shaken society over the past two decades.

&gt;It also speaks to the power of nontraditional media, say advocates for abuse victims, who have for years pressed accusations through courts or mainstream news outlets with limited resonance.

&gt;In a 1997 newspaper interview, Karol Chum, a 45-year-old software engineer, first accused Cardinal Hernyk Gulbinowicz, a much-loved figure who helped lead Poland’s anti-Communist movement, of having abused him as a child. The accusation drew no response from civil or church authorities at the time.

&gt;But when Mr. Chum repeated it on Facebook last month, it drew thousands of likes and shares and widespread media coverage. The Archdiocese of Wroclaw, in western Poland, said it launched an investigation within 24 hours of the post.

&gt;“Although it is difficult to consider a meme as a way to report a crime, we decided to treat it as a filed complaint,” an archdiocese spokesman said, referring to the Facebook posting.

&gt;How should the Catholic Church handle accusations of abuse against clergy? Join the conversation below.

&gt;Church representatives declined to make Cardinal Gulbinowicz, now in his 90s, available for interview or comment, citing his ill health and advanced age. The Polish episcopate declined to comment on the accusation.

&gt;The surge in cases will be a test of the resolve of the Vatican and the church’s Polish hierarchy to tackle sex-abuse allegations, which were the subject of a major Vatican summit in February. Under new rules that took effect June 1, Catholic clergy must expedite investigations of bishops accused of child sex abuse or covering up such crimes by their priests. The “Tell No One” documentary includes several victims who allege that the priests who abused them enjoyed protection from local bishops.

&gt;Church leaders in Poland have declined to follow the “zero tolerance” policy that was adopted in the U.S. in the 2000s, under which any priest found to have sexually abused a person under the age of 18 is permanently removed from the ministry. Church leaders in only a handful of countries have emulated the U.S.’s zero-tolerance policies.

&gt;As of February, at least nine priests convicted in court of child sex-abuse crimes continued to celebrate Mass publicly as priests in Poland.

&gt;The Polish episcopate said in an emailed response to questions that its bishops apologize to everyone affected by such abuse. “The Bishops warned against transferring the guilt of particular clerics to all priests,” the episcopate wrote.

&gt;Church leaders have taken some steps to counter abuse—for example, increasing the age of consent from 15 to 18 under church law. Later this month, Polish bishops are set to meet to discuss whether and how to tighten rules on how sex-abuse allegations are handled.

&gt;In a poll last month by Kantar, an international opinion-research firm, 60% of Polish respondents said the entire church was responsible for the sex-abuse scandals, not just individuals. In another survey this month, by Institute Pollster, 86% of Polish respondents considered pedophilia a real problem in the church. In that poll, only a third said they trusted the institution, and 57% said the YouTube documentary had negatively affected their opinion.

&gt;Previous polls seeking Poland’s general opinion of the church were considerably more positive toward it.

&gt;“So far, the dynamic was, we had scandals, news reports, and then slowly but surely this was fading away,” said Elżbieta Korolczuk, a Polish sociologist and prominent commentator on sexual-abuse issues. “Whereas today it seems we have this kind of synergy. …This kind of anger, disillusionment with the church as a structure is seeping in.”

&gt;The issue is posing a political riddle for Poland’s conservative, ruling Law and Justice party, which blends cultural conservatism and defense of the church with nationalism and cautious skepticism toward the European Union. Following the outcry, the government has stiffened penalties for child sexual abuse.

&gt;“We are strongly against this narrative that sexual crimes committed by men in frocks are somehow different, or worse than those committed by other pedophiles,” said Marcin Horala, a Law and Justice lawmaker. “We want to prosecute all pedophiles.”",,/r/europe/comments/bzq0ub/sexabuse_accusations_grow_against_catholic_clergy/eqv0td3/,kanter20,1560338978

&gt;emissions from homes, transport, farming and industry will have to be avoided completely

home, transport : meaning cars, trains, lorries, boats, planes and homes heating be all electric, with nuclear powerplants to feed them

farming : they all become vegetarian, forgo fertilizers and pesticides without a significant drop in production. Electric tractors and harvesters too.

1070,"&gt; I think that's partially the point - morality is not tied to religion. Babylon was a pagan society with a set of codes and rules not directly related to their mythology.

But how do you know which specific laws were due to society-wide morality, and which were due to practical considerations. We as a society don't consider most traffic infractions as immoral, but they're still in the penal code. Nor do we consider banana shape to be a moral question, but we still have laws regulating that. 

&gt; I can't find when Jesus mentioned not looting people, but the Old Testament explicitly allows it.

All theft is considered immoral in Christianity (to be clear, I'm talking about actual non-protestant Christianity which has Church tradition, I can't think of any valid justifications for protestants Sola scriptura interpretations, nor do I agree with them and I agree that they aren't logically consistent with regards to the Old Testament). I don't know of any example of a Christian church supporting people going on raving expeditions, whereas that is not only permissible, but encouraged in paganism. 

&gt; Here's a ~~Christian~~ Protestant blog which is cool with the loot and plunder of warfare.

FTFY. I won't waste time on them, since protestantism isn't even internally logically consistent.

&gt; There's also the parable of the strong man where Jesus loots the devil after beating him

1109,And here I thought we were talking about religion. But either way that is a complicated subject and its very hard to tell. If you just look at average dollars given conservative areas tend to give more than liberal ones. But that is a small part of the story. Conservatives are more likely to participate in consumption philanthropy where they are giving but to churches or schools they use so they are in effect giving in exchange for a service they use. Religion is the one that really muddies the water here. Conservative are much more likely to give to religious organizations that are not passing that money on but are in fact just using it to boost the religion itself 75% of all giving in the USA goes to religious institutions. The other issue is that liberal areas have more wealth redistribution than conservative built into taxes. So they are already giving more of their money and the organisations that would be funded by donation in conservative areas are funded through taxation. What can be said is that the religious and nonreligious tend to give about the same amount if you discount direct donations to churches. Either way it is a complicated issue but religion is clearly not the cause of charity.,,/r/europe/comments/bzefy1/christianity_as_default_is_gone_the_rise_of_a/eqtqyj8/,quaintmercury,1560317483

In other worsds society which is founded on nothing but social foundations will eventually colapse under the sinkhole which is secularism, and the reason secularism can’t survive is because it isn’t founded on anything.

1129,"&gt;Particularly why does this sub think that a complete lack of belief is the best thing ever and many (not all) commentators shame religion?

Because relgion is illogical. If you actually take an objective look at religion, it's clearly a load of bullshit.

If you want to run a society well, where we all work together to make things good. It helps to use policy based on empirical evidence, logic, nuance etc.

Having a block of voters who's entire worldview is based in ""faith"" instead of ""empirical evidence"" stands in the way of having a functional society. When a Doctor saves a mans life, it's not a miracle. It's due to the skill and resources of the hospital staff. 

There are religious people in America who believe climate change isn't real or we don't have to worry about it because (a) God gave us everything we need on earth (b) it's all ""part of Gods plan"" (c) it's part of the rapture and we'll be fine when the world ends. And many many more bullshit theories. You can see why society would be much better off if these people were educated, gifted critical thinking tools etc. so they could understand how toxic their beliefs are???

Let's be real.

The legal definition of slavery is when a person is considered to be the property of another person, and has the same amount of rights as an inanimate object. (This is the definition for chattel slavery in the new world, as I'm aware that other civilizations had different laws or their slaves)

Poverty has been the situation of most people for most of history, and that alone cannot be the only criteria for being considered a slave. Its really just a matter of subtlety in meaning, and you're ignoring it.

There's no such thing as economic freedom. At least in the way you're implying it. What you're talking about is financial/economic capability. Economic freedom would more so be about having legal restrictions in place that control what you can/cannot buy or sell.

If the people dealing with the first-world problems you're mentioning are to be considered slaves, then what are we supposed to consider the people that literally have no fucking food or water to drink, and are literally fighting starvation everyday?

If the people that live paycheck to paycheck are slaves, then what are the people who don't even have a job?

Your concerns are about things that are not practical issues to the people you're talking about. The people who really have it bad are not in position to waste time thinking about any of that. From their point of view, just having dependable food is a luxury. 

What you're getting at are really social justice issues, which frankly, have no place in the same discussion as slavery. Your concerns are legit, but you're trying to equate two things that just don't sit at the same level, and by doing so you sound a bit out of touch.

1247,"Less than a month into his first term, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has already made clear that he will primarily focus on domestic issues, leaving his country’s foreign policy objectives unchanged. Kyiv will continue to hold the line on its Minsk Agreements with Moscow and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine: it understands that, unless the Kremlin changes tack, the Ukrainian authorities can do little to end the war there.

Yet the president can reframe Kyiv’s political approach to Donbas, by shifting away from a militarised and defensive approach, and towards outreach and reconstruction. While defending Ukraine’s territory, Zelenskiy can now prioritise the defence of the country’s people. Through outreach to residents of Donbas, he can change the deadly status quo. This is hardly a risk-free strategy, but it could eventually help Ukraine shift the balance of power in the conflict and force Moscow to reconsider its approach.",Luxembourg,/r/europe/comments/bzm94x/ukraine_zelenskiy_in_donbas/eqtfzqs/,JackRogers3,1560310919

Don't people do that? Celebrating religion diminishing doesn't mean they don't let you live your religion.

And I feel that stance is also a bit hypocritical, considering religion - with rare exceptions like judaism - is always busy trying to convert people, it is a core function of religion to spread. Might as wel ask, why can't religious people leave others alone?

&amp;#x200B;

The main reason I'm quite happy about religion becoming less relevant to people is that religion is and always was not just a believe system, but also a tool to amass power and control people. Just read up about early christianity and how cynical it's creation and shaping process was, designed to compete and beat competing religions.

I think you are the one who is biased by your beliefs, making such absolute and unsupported claims as ""religious people in general are less intelligent than those who are not religious"".
Someone interested in an impartial discussion of facts would not make such claims.

Furthermore, your claimed linkage to ancient religions borders on the ridiculous. The parallels between different religions were already noted and known millennia before the start of the current decrease of religiosity in Europe. Entire religious groups have sprung up based on the idea that two different religions are actually quite similar. The early Church made very heavy use of these parallels in order to convert the pagan populations of Europe. To claim that these long-known and well-studied parallels are directly linked to the decline in religiosity in the 20th century is strange to say the least.

1326,"&gt; Belarus cannot contest to GDL legacy, ~~because Belarus nationalist movements are being raided by the State riot police and their members are given jail time.  Lithuania is the only legitimate because it is Status Quo and no one is contesting, not even a puff in media. Belarus does not even try on national level to contest.~~

Not a valid reason. What the country currently does not matter in regards to its hysterical legacy. Its not a contest, its history. Fact.

Wrong. I was describing France's case, as an example of how a country can change over time, in response to your argument that Belarus is now anti-west and pro-Russian.

**Show me the UN resolution,** what commission was in charge of the investigation. What percent of the world? Show the each countries statement regarding this**. Fact.** 

&gt; **No, they are not contesting** 

**They do not need to be contesting.** Belarus has as much right to the GDL as you do because of history, not because of the present and nonsense reasons you made up like ""legacy by geopolitics"" , contesting. or ""status quo""  That just not how it works, you don't inherit hysterical legacy by having the same political goals or winning some contest. That doesn't even make any sense France isn't trying to colonize the world any more and the French Empire is still its legacy. And how would ""status quo"" prove anything, the status quo is that Belarus is now Pro Russia and anti Western, I repeat, countries can change over time, even if France decided to become a communist dictatorship one day the Kingdom of France's legacy will be there's no matter what they do in the future, contesting or no contesting.",,/r/europe/comments/bxojby/map_of_europe_1500/eqt6qg6/,muchogusto98,1560303713

In order to establish education as the primary cause of decreasing religiosity you'd first of all need to proof a correlation that holds true universally (i.e. everywhere and not just in one country). Then you'd need to proof that this correlation is also a causation, in other words that education is the cause behind the decrease in religiosity rather than any of the many other factors that may be the cause.

I am not aware of any research into this (which doesn't mean that there isn't, just that I haven't looked for it), but I predict that the outcome of any such investigation into the link between education and religious decline would be that education on its own can not explain the decline in religiosity, but rather that this decline seems to be the result of a complex composition of different social and individual factors.

That has two reasons. First is that it's long term project, so investors are unveiling to invest in it, due to risk of future unreasonable governmental regulations, like unconstitutional nuclear tax in Germany or forced closures.

And second reason is that government is much more reliable party, which means lower interests of loans, so high capital expenditure long-term project such as nuclear power plant becomes significantly cheaper.

For a practical example, the US is a much richer country than Cuba is, and the US has more highly ranked universities than Cuba does. But despite that, Cuba is still regarded as being a country with good education.
In another example, the US is quite a bit richer than Russia and has better universities. But despite that, Russia has a higher average level of education in that more people have had tertiary education.

The idea that he felt God was informing his foreign policy decisions was pretty terrifying to a lot of people.  

  But yeah his decision to delay conversion to Catholicism was partly to avoid the potential constitutional headache, but also because that would attract further attention to his religiosity.  If it came to it there'd be some fudge, but Blair didn't want to worsen his bad 'Bible-basher' rep. Iain D.

1495,"1) I've travelled a fair amount on trains in Europe, (although not with a eurail pass so I can't comment on the specifics of that) both within and between countries, and I've never had any trouble buying tickets on the day. They were never even close to being full, except for when there was a rail strike in Belgium. 

There's usually space for larger suitcases at the ends of carriages, and space for smaller bags in the overhead compartments. The spaces for larger bags may fill up quickly on busy trains, so I'd advise boarding the trains as soon as you can to beat other people to them (politely of course).

If you can't rebook a train that you've missed, busses can be long but cheap. Alternatively low cost airlines may be worth a look, try something like Skyscanner.

I guess train etiquette is the same as anywhere, don't be too loud, don't listen to music or videos without headphones, wear deodorant, don't litter etc. Just general politeness, and as you care enough to ask I'm sure you'll be fine. 

2) I don't think it'll make a difference what accent you speak in. Haggling mostly isn't a thing, except at markets or with street vendors. And even then it's not really because people are trying to rip you off, it's just about making a deal. Souvenir stores may be over priced though, just shop around. Maybe I'm not the best person to offer advice here because I hate haggling, I just don't buy the item if I'm not happy to pay the price. As a rule of thumb I'd say if the price on a label/sign, don't haggle, but if there's no marked price it doesn't hurt to have a go. 

As for the language I'm sure you'll be fine, English is spoken widely in most cities. I think it's always nice to learn a few cursory words/phrases such as hello, goodbye, thank you, please, I would like/can I have, bill/check please, etc. If you're anything like me it takes you two days to learn them and then you're leaving the country, but it's fun and people usually appreciate the effort. I've found that in France in particular people are much warmer to you if you make a small effort, but in most other countries even if you speak to them in their language they'll reply in English. Taxis may be the exception though, if you do get one, try to have the address written down or on your phone to show them. 

3) The Google translate feature that scans writing and translates it in real time is really useful for reading menus. It can give you some gibberish but you get the gist. 

4/5) The best travel advice I can offer for Europe is don't eat in the main tourist hot spots. Food will be crap and/or over priced. Just wander away from any major tourist attraction for at least a few streets, and read the menus before choosing a place. You'll end up eating somewhere that locals eat and at a more affordable price. 

I've never had an issue with crime in Europe but always be careful of pickpockets. Keep your phone and wallet in a zipped/inside pocket if possible. Wear layers, and pack at least one lightweight waterproof. It rains a lot in Europe, even in June! But if you do get caught out you can buy anything you need relatively cheaply.

There has never been a society that's been atheistic/irreligious from the getgo -- this European laicism is something from the last 70 years tops.

If you learn about the lifecycles of cultures and civilizations, the death of religion is one of the trademark signs a society is dying. And the death of religion tends to come after the peak point of the culture - i.e. during a time of great material wealth.

Humans aren't naturally moral from birth (if you don't teach a child not to rob, he'll grow up to be a thief) -- a moral code must be imposed onto most people.

In fact, I'll tell you what I see happening today in the Western world: as Christianity loses relevance, a new religion takes its place. One I like to call ""Human Rights-ism"".

1589,"Ouch, hang on tiger, I'm taking some punches here 😅

There's a reason christianity works so well together with science and why the ""interpretations"" are born: because God created science as well. And as we learn more about science, we learn more about how God might have created the world as well. What if God started the world with a big bang? What if world's creation took billions of years and God made new animals based on previous ones?

That's, um, interesting. So you know what parts of the Bible should be taken literally and what parts not? If you do, please tell me, I'd love to know.
The Bible is everything God wants to say to us (directly). There is no prologue saying ""notice thee puny humans, for every word in this book is to be taken like thou would understand it intuitively in the 21st century!"" God is pretty mysterious, and also not an answer machine. We don't get to know everything about the universe or Him even if we would love to.

And sorry, no. There is no such point at which christianity and science collide ""too much"". Because there is no such point. Like I said before, science and God fit perfectly together.

Can you honestly, you, one person, say that the millions, even billions of people whose lives God has turned completely around, who could anytime tell you about their life and life stories, are lying to themselves and it's just placebo/brainwashing/denial? That's pretty bold, yo.

Would say I'm pretty honest too. Not perfect, but trying my hardest. With ""lost"" I was referring to two things. First, the fact that christianity has less and less footing in Europe. And second, the fact that many many many people follow the big mass and trends. And nowadays it seems that the big mass thinks that christianity/religion in general is ""out"".

This just isn't true. Visit Teheran and under the thin veneer of orthodoxy and state authority you'll find the same secularisation that is almost universally occuring everywhere in the world.  Funnily enough the conflict between  religious and non-religious populations is almost always superficial. We don't live in a world any more where religion has considerable ideological force, the university curriculum in Iran looks like it does in Germany, and when we're sick we all go to the doctor.

1696,"There is a study about religiosity and party preferences which I once read and found highly interesting. Conclusion of the study was the following: The more separated church and state are the more rightwing religious people vote, because they would have a doubled social safety net and the government would support programs which are at odds with their beliefs.

In a country with a state church and a highly devout population the population would be much more willing to approve of social programs as these often run through churches and also support said churches and communities by for example paying priests. Because state churches are largely a thing of the past this lead to a gathering of religious in rightwing parties. 

As an example cited in the study the authors took a look at the opinions of religious people on state redistribution of wealth before and after the Swedish Lutheran Church was separated from the Swedish State. If I remember correctly religious were 10%-points less likely to support redistribution of wealth after the change.

No, I talk about the Second Arab Israel War of 1956:

&gt; The Suez Crisis, or the Second Arab–Israeli War, also named the Tripartite Aggression in the Arab world  and Operation Kadesh or Sinai War in Israel, was an invasion of Egypt in late 1956 by Israel, followed by the United Kingdom and France. The aims were to regain Western control of the Suez Canal and to remove Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had just nationalized the canal. After the fighting had started, political pressure from the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Nations led to a withdrawal by the three invaders. The episode humiliated the United Kingdom and France and strengthened Nasser.
&gt; 
&gt; On 29 October, Israel invaded the Egyptian Sinai. Britain and France issued a joint ultimatum to cease fire, which was ignored. On 5 November, Britain and France landed paratroopers along the Suez Canal. The Egyptian forces were defeated, but they did block the canal to all shipping. It later became clear that the Israeli invasion and the subsequent Anglo-French attack had been planned beforehand by the three countries.
&gt; 
&gt; The three allies had attained a number of their military objectives, but the canal was useless. Heavy political pressure from the United States and the USSR led to a withdrawal. U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower had strongly warned Britain not to invade; he threatened serious damage to the British financial system by selling the US government's pound sterling bonds.

While leaving the EU has stunted growth, Britain is outside of recession territory thus far.

1. The economy is flexible and regulations tend to be pro-business. That ultimately makes it easier for companies to adapt when risks come rather than needing to do it way in advance.
2. While integration with the EU is heavy, it is lighter than for any other member (just roughly 50% of trade is with the EU, separate currency, etc). Italexit would not be nearly as smooth, for example.

2443,"Not FDR. FDR's vision for the end of the war was a system in which the BE, USA, USSR and ROC became the only countries with militaries, responsible for peace in their respective spheres. This involved the BE acting as peacekeeper in oceania, the middle east, Africa Southeast asia and India. FDR was dead before the war was even over, the UNSC was formed in the ashes of the ""four sheriffs"" plan, and didn't involve global disarmament, and it was as a result of *this* system and poor post-war economy that forced Britain to surrender its Empire. Britain retained a lot of control over the foreign policies of former colonies for decades, it's frankly amazing to me that considering the concerted efforts of our politicians, the USA and the UN that it took *so many* decades for Britain to successfully decolonise, and even now to still be nominally ruling over foreign realms, and better yet for our successors in various spheres to still control our former territories (New Zealand still controlling the Cook Islands and Niue, for example). 

Arguably, ROC's inclusion was an attempt by FDR to undermine Britain in Asia, but this system *required* Britain to take an even more substantial role in Africa, which doesn't sound like decolonisation to me.

2463,"To be honest it's hard to speak in terms of just right and left anymore, the main fault line is moderates vs. left/right radicals.

What remains of the moderate right is in the process of being slowly assimilated into the majority (the party structure isn't fixed, an independent center-right party is likely but generally speaking he's on good terms with right-wing leaders and an alliance should happen in a way or another), and he is already very well differentiated from Le Pen's nationalists, so politically it's sort of become settled.

Likewise our radical left (a good \~20% of voters) is deeply skeptical of economic liberalism so there's no way you could confound them.

So strategically he just needs to do well in general, to convince as many people as possible that his approach is improving things.

He probably would like to do more on green and social aspects but there's no financial margin (as the French public debt is already \~100% of GDP and yearly deficit is structurally 2.5-3% despite already relatively high tax rates).

* Early guns, and I'd assume this, used powder that combusted more-quickly.  Look at modern smokeless powder ignited relative to old black powder.  That creates a very high pressure initially.  It's better to have a long barrel with a slower reaction that keeps the pressure about constant as the projectile is moving down the barrel.

2646,"Right, ok. They started the process for a ton of Chetniks, but it's not over yet. Great. Also yeah, if you walk around any street with souvenir stands in larger Serbian cities, you'll see shirts and other stuff with Chetnik (or worse, 90s) imagery on them. Then there's the Ravna gora series and the celebrations of the Ravna gora movement etc etc. Come on, we're not stupid.

Vučić is constantly spouting nationalist and warmongering rhetoric, whenever it suits him. Both in person and over his hysteric tabloids, like Informer. Do you remember his speech in Kosovo a few months ago? He basically said that the only problem with Milošević's foreign policies was that he didn't win the war. How do you think people in Croatia, Bosnia or Kosovo took that? He has a long history of that, at least from his infamous 1995 Glina speech (for which I believe the first people who should want to hang him by the balls should be Krajina Serbs, honestly). 

Serbian is also the official language of municipalities with &gt;30% Serb population in Croatia. Vojvodina is much better when it comes to minority rights but again, you really can't just compare Vukovar with Subotica and say ""look at these bloodthirsty Croats"". Just to be clear, I'm completely fine with Cyrillic in Vukovar (and most younger Croats from Vukovar that I know don't really give a fuck either), but please don't play dumb and pretend like there's no difference between that and Vojvodina.

The pogrom-like situation was a reference to those protests and boycotts against a brother (!) of some guy who made an Albanian salute.

But again, the situation for Serbs in Croatia is far from ideal. It's not anywhere close like it used to be in the 90s (and Croatian Serbs will confirm you that) but they are still not safe and equal. And that's a huge problem for Croatia which I'm doing my best to confront irl.

2712,"&gt; Every year, both your president and the leadership of the Serbian Orthodox Church hold speeches about your boys “just defending themselves” in Croatia. Vučić compared the soldiers of the RSK to Anne Frank last year, ffs. 

Never heard of any of this, but Vucic is a retard so it doesn't sound implausible.

&gt; but you have to face the fact that many people in Serbia eat up his bullshit. 

No, what you have to face is the fact that Vucic is not a democratically elected president that reflects the views and beliefs of the common serb, but is instead a quasy-dictator who got to power via various methods of election fraud. If every vote he got in the election was counted as legitimate and lord fucking knows many, many aren't, he would still have the support of less than 25% of the people. Again, IF you counted them as legitimate. Which they're not.

&gt; Well, aside from the fact that wearing football jerseys isn’t really the same as living as a minority in some country, you’re also not really giving an equal example. If we are going for an honest discussion, we have to talk about the way that a Croat would be accepted in, say, Banja Luka, Herceg Novi or any larger city in Serbia itself where a significant number of immigrants from the ex-warzones make their home. *Or*, we could talk about the way an Albanian football jersey would be seen in Belgrade, since people from the Republic of Serbia actually do see Albanians as an invading force *on the territory of their country*.

2727,"&gt;Then you stifle research into GMOs but promote research that is more random like mutagenesis and hybridizing. 

Given that it replicates natural processes of randomization, the odds are that most combinations have already been produced by natural processes, so the risk of disruption is nihil.

There are plenty of opportunities for GM that don't involve field tests. Furthermore, we can always permit certain specific GM modifications, or entire categories, later, if we know more. But the ""banned by default"" rule must remain in place.

&gt;We know more about what we've done to GMO plants than any other technique, yet because of irrational and emotional fear we don't get to make crops that may potentially help us in the fight against climate change.

In practice, most GMOs are about pesticide resistance, to encourage spraying more.

&gt;The answer will likely be superficial and insipid, something along the lines of either putting frog genes in tomatoes isn't the same as taller wheat. Or if I'm lucky you'll hide your scientific ignorance and also just fear monger and say "" GMO is much more powerful then these methods and we don't know the long term consequences"".

It seems you're very much afraid of those statements, so afraid that you have to try to discredit them beforehand, by using *very scientific* namecalling like ""superficial and insipid"" ""your scientific ignorance and als you just fear monger"".

Putting frog genes in tomatoes effectively isn't the same: randomizing methods may be random, but are just one step away from the original. Tomatoes don't mutate randomly into frog gene sequences. No glow-in-the-dark pigs without GM. Why is that important? Because there stil is limited horizontal gene transfer, or simply transfer between species that can interbreed, and then things that would be wonderful in crops like drought resistance could end up in weeds. Or the code of an enzym that dissolves specific plant cells - quite handy for weedkillers - could get transferred into some kind of microorganism, or even just an ordinary pest like snails, and then it's simply game over. 

Or do you deny that GM is more powerful than other methods, or that you don't know the long term consequences?

&gt;Your songs has been attacked and debunked by an army of research and science, yet you keep singing it.

There are stem cell scientists in the green fraction in the EP, you're not going to be able to wave around a lab coat to claim authority. Science just provides the odds, by the way, it's a policy choice up to which point we accept them.

I was born and grew up in Poland but spent most of my adult life in the US so the distance and time gives me a bit of a perspective. What are those nationalists so proud of? In 15 and 16th century Poland (in union with the Duchy of Lithuania) was a regional power. There was no Germany or Russia yet to speak of. Ukraine and Poland were the gates to Europe, both countries suffered greatly from Mongol and later Ottoman Empire invasions. When the union fell apart that was pretty much it. Ever since then Poland barely existed as a nation (or nations, because there were several) not to mention a sovereign country.

The reason to be proud is what people have done in the past 30 years but those nationalists are against it. They don't want to be in the EU, they don't want immigrants, no marriage equality, no reproductive rights for women. What do they want? Back to 16th century because the country was a shitshow after that. The conservative party has a slogan ""Poland, the heart of Europe"".

It was a different time, and it's not exactly like the common person had a choice in the matter, true, but it always amazes me that people lived together after such a thing, and it seemed there was a real attempt to leave the past in the past: *bratstvo i jedinstvo*.

2776,"&gt; Ok, but I agree with that sentiment (on an ideal basis), that's exactly what I'm saying when I say ""big capitalists love open borders and free markets"". It makes it way easier for them to move capital around, produce in some areas, and sell in others, maximizing profits and, more importantly, hurting the negotiating power of workers in both areas who can't move as freely as the business owner and his capital.

But nobody ever argued to put put barriers *inside* a country either to fix that problem, despite capital being able to move freely there. So the freedom of capital is pretty much a given either way, the only point about open borders is whether labor has more freedom or not, and then I choose more freedom for persons. I don't think we should let us divide inside the pen of national borders. If we have good ways to regulate capital inside a country we can also apply that inside the EU.

That means we still need to impose more restrictions on capital, but to that end the EU is a lot more powerful than a national state. National states are often played against each other, for example the tax evasion issues. The EU manages to fine giants like Google and Microsoft. It don't see an individual country doing that.

As for the competition between workers, I think it's an overall benefit. The unified labor market of the EU will lead to wage convergence. So far it seems to be predominantly an upward convergence in previously restricted areas, so that's a good thing for labor. Initiatives like a European minimum wage will also put a floor under that progress so we can't backslide.

&gt;See my other point: globalization involves a loss of control from the average citizen. [...]

Yes, absolutely. But economic globalization *has already happened*. Unless you propose a policy aimed at complete autarchy and closed borders, I don't see how we're going to turn back that clock. So what we can do now is making sure that political power catches up with globalization, and globalizes too, so the political power can face the economical power as equal. And then the worker can exercise democratic power over the economy again.

&gt;This may be hard to understand because it's a divorce from economic idealizations, but it is the practical reality of how this works.

It's pretty much as predicted by economic theory. But that's exactly why you need larger political entities, to make sure no one undercuts labor and environmental standards.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/bwa8ee/we_already_tried/eqpr5jv/,silverionmox,1560203156

Okay, let's look at Spain's environmental record.

""The key environmental issues faced by Spain are:

* Deforestation - Extensive forests of Spain have been destroyed over the years due to unplanned cutting, forest fires, and poor farming practices. The attempts to implement reforestation schemes by the government have not been very successful.
* Air pollution – Acid rain, the destruction of the Ozone layer and the greenhouse effect are all consequences of the air pollution problem that Spain faces. Industrial CO2 emissions in 1995 amounted to 223.2 million Mt and globally Spain ranked 20th in emissions.
* Quality and quantity of water nationwide -  Industrial and agricultural waste contributes to Spain’s water pollution problem, as well as oil tankers that travel to the nation's shores. The Mediterranean Sea is polluted due to dumping of effluents and raw sewage from oil and gas production offshore.
* Desertification - 36% of the country is threatened by desertification with the Canaries and the south-east being the worst hit. Though a part of this degradation is due to climate change, natural processes, the loss of soil fertility of irrigated land by salinization, erosion overgrazing, fire, and human mismanagement.""

The disintegration of the right is visible now in elections but it was pretty much acted right after the 2017 election two years ago, when the center-right got the prime minister, economy minister and budget minister positions and many center-right leaders seceded from LR into and independent right-wing party.

&gt;**A Norwegian court has backed the government's plans for oil exploration in the Arctic, which had been challenged by environmental groups.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The issuing of oil exploration licences breached a constitutional right to a healthy environment, the groups said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The 10 licences were issued in 2016 to explore the Barents Sea above the Arctic circle.  
&gt;  
&gt;Norway is seeking to replace production from its dwindling oilfields in the North Sea and Norwegian Sea.  
&gt;  
&gt;Although signed up to the 2015 Paris climate change agreement, it is western Europe's biggest producer and exporter of oil and gas.  
&gt;  
&gt;Greenpeace says global energy companies have already discovered more oil and gas than the world can safely burn.  
&gt;  
&gt;They accused Norway of violating a section of the country's constitution, amended in 2014, that guarantees the right to a healthy environment.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The environmental organisations' argument that the plan violates the Constitution's Article 112 has not succeeded,"" the ruling by Oslo district court said. ""The state, represented by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, is exonerated.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The court also ruled that Norway could not be held responsible for CO2 emissions caused by hydrocarbons exported to other countries.

I don't know what point you are making, but you brought up Chamberlain, so I thought you were comparing this situation to the one in Europe in 1938.

&gt; The deal didn't prohibit them from getting the weapons. The deal delayed development. That's it. It's a bad deal.

The deal explicitely prohibited them from having nukes and the inspectors confirmed that they complied with the rules of the deal. What would happen after the deal was over is another thing, but when the deal was in force, Iran did not have nukes and was not working towards having them. The hope was that through the deal a mutual trust can be established which could eventually result in a more long-term solution.

&gt; Well, it took about 30 years of sanctions and isolation to get Iran to negotiate

Yes, but for 30 years sanctions were enough to prevent them from getting nukes. Why should they not be enough now? Why should we need striking capability? You know where this striking capability can bring us? Precisely to another 2003's scenario, where the US admistrative decides that Iran has WMDs even if they don't have any. Nobody in Europe wants another destructive pointless war in the Middle East with another country ruined as a result.

So far, sanctions worked okay. The deal also seemed to work. If it was given more time, perhaps it could turn into a success. If not, we could return to sanctions.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/byy3s0/system_to_circumvent_us_sanctions_on_iran_ready/eqof6py/,kristynaZ,1560187811

&gt; I don't know what point you are making, but you brought up Chamberlain, so I thought you were comparing this situation to the one in Europe in 1938.

Well, I'm more comparing your attitudes toward's Chamberlain's - naive appeasement.  Obviously Iran is more distant from Europe than Germany, but I strongly suspect a nuclear Iran is going to be a much more disruptive actor (even if unlikely to actually use the weapons).

&gt;The deal explicitely prohibited them from having nukes and the inspectors confirmed that they complied with the rules of the deal. What would happen after the deal was over is another thing, but when the deal was in force, Iran did not have nukes and was not working towards having them. The hope was that through the deal a mutual trust can be established which could eventually result in a more long-term solution.

So it's a pause.  A pause during which Iran can build its economy, stockpile hard currency, import necessary materials and equipment, train experts, etc.

&gt;Yes, but for 30 years sanctions were enough to prevent them from getting nukes. Why should they not be enough now? Why should we need striking capability?

Because we've always had that striking ability as a backup.  We've even used it before in the past, when we used Iraq as a proxy against Iran.

&gt;Precisely to another 2003's scenario, where the US admistrative decides that Iran has WMDs even if they don't have any.

There is absolutely no way that America is going to risk a mistake like that again.  America has been paying the price - diplomatically - for that mistake for 15 years.  It's going to be paying the war debt off for decades.  American support for the military and for foreign intervention dropped precipitously.  Donald Trump was elected in part because of his isolationist tendencies.

And furthermore, the Iraq War wasn't destined to be a disaster.  If either civilian or military leadership had proved even moderately more competent, the sectarian violence could have been prevented and a more stable regime put in place sooner.  Iraq was mistake, after mistake, after mistake, after mistake, after mistake - ad nauseum.  Disbanding the Iraqi military.  Letting the looting begin.  Not intervening when sectarian violence began.  De Baathification.  Not understanding the tribal relationships.  Allowing PMCs to operate with immunity from prosecution.  Keeping soldiers on base and sending them out for random patrols, rather than securing the community.

Seriously, Iraq is a worst-case scenario.  But no, I'm not advocating for an invasion of Iran (which would be a much bloodier and longer conflict), I'm simply pointing out that Iraq was just a constant string of incompetence.

&gt;So far, sanctions worked okay.

  https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/b6p8br/chernobyl_official_trailer_for_the_hbo_miniseries/ejmv2th/

&gt;The USSR used a cheaper-to-build reactor design than LITERALLY THE WHOLE REST OF THE WORLD! It lacked a heavy steel and concrete containment building, it used the steam directly produced by the uranium fuel to run the turbines (water turned to steam IN the reactor core and there was no heat exchanger separating irradiated steam and water from, fuckin... NOT radioactive water), it used hollow graphite blocks as a moderator to maintaining the nuclear chain reaction (US and West European reactors use pressurized water, so no water, no nuclear reaction), the boron control rods were graphite tipped (which briefly increased reactor output upon insertion, this is important for later) and about 57 other glaring flaws... like safety systems THAT COULD BE OVERRIDDEN!

Which is a noble effort, but I don't think you're looking at things broadly enough.

To support your argument, you want to restrain yourself to a very narrow definition of terrorism, and you want to make it exclusive to Europe.

You are choosing to ignore all the things inconvenient to your point of view.  For example - if America backed out of the Gulf and let Iran dominate the region, what would be the consequences?

Iran has already demonstrated a willingness to attack oil tankers on a number of occasions.  It has *repeatedly* threatened to shut down the Strait of Hormuz.  Europe, more so than America, is dependent on oil from the gulf region.

KSA is a shitty, horrible state that treats its citizens poorly, is wildly corrupt, largely inept, and proselytizes the shittiest interpretation of a generally shitty religion across the world.

However, KSA is very dependent on western support.

Iran is not dependent on the West.  Iran is a regional power, with a larger industrial base, larger population, and better strategic position than Saudi Arabia.  Whereas KSA has allowed its religion to get out of hand and tolerated/encouraged fanatics, Iran is specifically hostile to the West.",Canada,/r/europe/comments/byy3s0/system_to_circumvent_us_sanctions_on_iran_ready/eqnxllj/,sluggathugga,1560181515

They appear to be a Spaniard living and working in Sweden, which goes a long way to explain why they feel this way: Sometimes, after a while, the frustrations of not quite fitting in, having to deal with a culture foreign to you, combined with often being socially isolated to a certain extent can cause expats to grow increasingly resentful of their host country. 

Look at /r/china, for example: It's full of angry white expats who seem to hate China and everything about it. I believe the same phenomenon is what's going on with this guy. 

I could especially understand being a bit resentful if the reasons for one's moving to a new country are not completely positive; for example, having to look for a job overseas because of the bad job market in your home country, like could be the case with Spain. 

They also complain a lot about the housing crisis in Sweden and how hard it is to find an apartment to rent, and I can really see the combination to have to leave your home for a job, facing difficulties making a life for yourself in the new country, and the general culture shock and homesickness stating to wear on a person.

And no, i'm quite a radical ecologist. So much that I want my country to exit Lisbon Treaties in order to be able to enact true, radical ecological transition ( which are impossible with the rules on ""True and fair competition"" and full Free-trade on all areas). 

When I say the EU is doomed to fall, it's not just because "" muh EU bad I hate it "", it's just that, if you look at it in a rational way : 

1-Most of the goals the EU had fixed for itself are failing, the most worrying being economical convergence ( the opposite is happening), especially in the euro-zone, and this is a very serious issue for many reasons. At one point the economic divergence will tear up the EU, this is almost mathematical. 

2-The EU is unable to deeply change. I'd like to be surprised on that, believe me. But sadly, I really think key parts of the treaties are locked by some countries and therefore no true change will be enacted until it's too late.

I interpreted your characterization of Hollywood movies as 'individualized psychological storytelling' as character dramas as a favor to you what you said is gibberish. Individualized and psychological applies to the vast majority of fiction across any medium, from Wuthering Heights to The Terminator. Then you say libertarian (in quotations for what reason?) in the US sense, what exactly did you mean by this? Libertarianism as a model exists in the same way across the planet and varies by regional prevalence rather than content, and on that note at notoriously low levels in LA. 

In response to your last message, when you generically complain about Hollywood's 'individualized psychological storytelling' which could equally apply to horror or drama or all fiction then I will consider the alternative a documentary.

Educated people are affected by these problems too.
You are trying to make a distinction but the reality is a well educated engineer will live in the same harsh rental market in Sweden because even an engineer may not want to buy an apartment and will have to deal with the short term rental market aka second hand contracts.

Corporate housing is very very limited and overpriced not even engineers can afford it unless they move to Sweden to work in short term projects because corporate housing is also Short term meaning less than 1 year contract.

The situation in Sweden regarding rental housing  is catastrophic but of course there are no news in English.

He shifts priorities to the center army group(towards Moscow) instead of the souther army group, wich would be more in line to Hitlers orders . 

After the war Halder consulted the US army history division. He blamed  Hitler and his inner circle for basically everything, the war , the defeat and crimes, portraing the Wermacht as blameless for those things.

Few politicians have thrown around this outrageous suggestion of not paying what we owe the EU, and this has very often been from Boris Johnson. The issue I see is that the media fail to hold Boris Johnson to account for his bollocks, and it embarrasses us when he says stuff like this.

Even days before the referendum it was never suggested we would be leaving the EU with no deal, politicians on TV said that it would be the easiest trade deal in history.

We used to be a world leader in that in the 1960s. Now we just have the one plant from the 1960s left. (There used to be two.) It's already 20 years past its rated lifespan, and it's the old 1960s design that might actually still pose some danger if it goes tits-up as opposed to modern designs, but we can't shut it down because we need to keep the lights on, and we can't build new one because of politics.

We have no mountains (so no hydropower), no sun (so barely any output from solar panels), no volcanic activity (so no geothermal power), and we have pretty much no room for wind turbines. They put up a few, but basically just for show, they don't generate anywhere near a significant amount of power. But we do have lots of coal and gas. 

The Green party wanted us to shut down the coal plants and import electricity instead... from German coal plants. You see, that way it's not *our* pollution.

2009, May 21: Soyuz-2.1a/Fregat carrying Meridian 2 - premature Soyuz upper stage shutdown.

2011, August 24: Soyuz-U carrying Progress M-12M - Soyuz upper stage engine failure.

2011, December 23: Soyuz-2.1b/Fregat-M carrying Meridian 5 - unspecified anomaly during the Soyuz upper stage burn, possible explosion inferred from data.

2014, August 22: Soyuz ST-B/Fregat-MT carrying Galileo 5 / Galileo 6 - hydrazine freeze in Fregat-MT's thruster fuel line due to a manufacturing defect.

2015, April 28: Soyuz-2.1a carrying Progress M-27M - upper stage malfunction near or during upper stage shutdown and spacecraft separation.

2015, December 05: Soyuz-2.1v/Volga carrying Kosmos 2511 (Kanopus-ST 1) / Kosmos 2512 (KYuA 1) - payload separation failure

2016, December 01: Soyuz-U carrying Progress MS-04 - Progress spacecraft prematurely separated from the third stage during third stage burn for unknown reasons.

2017, July 14: Soyuz-2.1a/Fregat-M carrying Kanopus-V-IK 1 plus lots of other satellites - most likely, a Fregat-M thruster failure damaged some of the satellites.

2017, November 28: Soyuz-2.1b/Fregat-M carrying Meteor-M 2-1 plus lots of other satellites - a Vostochny polar launch triggered a software defect in Fregat-M guidance leading to wrong orientation during Fregat-M engine burn.

2018, October 11: Soyuz-FG carrying Soyuz-MS 10 - Side booster separation failure.

2019, February 21: Soyuz-2.1b/Fregat-M carrying EgyptSat A - third stage was loaded with wrong amounts of kerosene and liquid oxygen (someone swapped the two numbers during launch operations).

3887,"&gt; They profit off every flight so paying off the debt isn't something they can't do. The US government wouldn't let SpaceX collapse - they've brought them back from the brink before and would do it again.

Let's just assume they're correct in saying that they profit on every launch (although Musk's companies don't necessarily have a good track record when it comes to statements about financials, and there were rumors to the contrary). Even by the more optimistic estimates, SpaceX's profit margins are very slim, and investors seem to be getting increasingly frustrated with Musk.

They also have to support the development of their new vehicles (which the US government seems to have less faith in) and the whole StarLink lark (which even by the company's own estimates wont be profitable for quite some time). That's also assuming they don't suffer another Falcon 9 failure, which could spell trouble. Again, their demise isn't a sure thing, but I wouldn't describe the situation as reassuring.

And while I'm sure the US is very interested in the tech and know-how at SpaceX, they might prefer that to be in the hands of another company.

&gt; The Shuttle was designed in the 1970s and had to endure re-entry from orbit. Falcon 9 was designed in the mid 2000s and the booster only has to survive ballistic re-entry. The F9 requires much less in the way of refurbishment because it hasn't been through as much thermal/aerodynamic stress and it uses more advanced materials.

&gt; They're already being refurbished and launched faster than the Shuttle (post-Challenger at least) - granted this isn't human-rated. Considering their first orbit was only 11 years ago, it's fair to assume they're going to improve this very quickly. Their current goal is refurb and launch in 24 hours.

Don't get me wrong, the Falcon 9 is a pretty impressive rocket and even in the worst case not even close to the disaster that the Space Shuttle was. My point was mainly that while the Falcon 9 is definitely better than the Shuttle in this regard, it might still not be good enough to justify the reusability investment. I think that's something that we'll only be able to say for sure in hindsight, in maybe 5-10 years.

&gt; Demand for access to orbit is (forgive the pun) skyrocketing. There is no way that they will run out of demand in the next 20 years - if they launch a few dozen cubesats in one launch, the cost per customer (including designing payload) will only be a few million each. Universities and medium-to-large companies will suddenly be able to afford their own satellites. SpaceX also has to launch and maintain Starlink (which I am not a big fan of, as an astronomer...) which will require several launches per year on its own.

I was thinking more about the kind of thing Arianespace, and especially the Ariane 5 currently, is specializing in: big GTO and interplanetary payloads. There are maybe two dozen of those per year total currently. Ariane 5 is currently launching about 6 times per year, with Ariane 6 they're aiming to increase that to 12. If you had a reusable booster with - say - 3 uses, you'd have to stop and restart production of new boosters, which - together with all the other costs associated with developing a reusable launcher - probably would end up costing more than just producing disposable Ariane 6s with newer, cheaper production methods. For the LEO market reusability might make more sense, but that's my point: That doesn't necessarily apply to every vehicle/target orbit/market.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/byij3i/a_poster_for_the_launch_capabilities_of_esas_new/eqk3q2z/,KoffeinFlummi,1560115663

Oh, I realize the reality of you having this opinion, I just can't fathom how you could possibly gotten it. Last time I checked with my bank they totally refused to cancel my debts should I stop being their customer.

&gt;The EU completely botched the writing of Article 50.

In 3 years of Brexit tug of war, you've been the only one I've seen making this claim.

&gt;It's not the UK's debt, it's the EU's.
The UK just agreed to service such debt for as long as its a member.

Which leaves quite a bit of UK debt for the time between agreeing to the budget and actually stopping being a member. Linguistic acrobatics don't change the realities of the situation.

&gt;It's also absurd that Article 50 can be revoked unilaterally by the leaving member at any point. But again, that is the legal reality.

I don't see why that would be absurd. The actual abuse of the ruling of the EU court of Justice exists pretty much exclusively in the heads of those that lament the ruling.

&gt; Moldova's pro-Russian President Igor Dodon has been stripped of his duties, escalating a political crisis stemming from inconclusive general elections. 

[Source 1](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48572304)

 

&gt;As signs of trouble brewed in Moldova on  Saturday, a spokeswoman for the European Union called for “calm and  restraint” and for the country’s leaders to respect the rule of law and  democracy. Russia urged all parties to avoid destabilization.  
&gt;  
&gt;Maia  Sandu, the leader of A.C.U.M., who is a former education minister and  World Bank adviser, was appointed prime minister on Saturday. But a  court struck down her appointment and that of a speaker of Parliament  also nominated by the Socialist Party.  
&gt;  
&gt;Supporters of the Democratic Party pitched tents in front of several ministries and state institutions on Saturday night.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ms.  Sandu said in Parliament on Sunday that the pitched tents “are proof  that the Democratic Party wants to use law enforcement bodies to throw  the country into chaos to protect a single person: Plahotniuc.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“They do not want to ensure the peaceful transition of power,” she added.  
&gt;  
&gt;Moldova has been dogged by political instability and graft, including [a breathtaking scandal](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/world/europe/moldova-bank-theft.html?module=inline) in 2014-15, in which $1 billion, around an eighth of the country’s economic output, was pilfered from three banks.

4042,"No, it is certainly not a lie. The test they performed was a standard test that all RBMK were supposed to go through. The staff involved made the test extremely dangerous by first Xenon poisoning the reactor. Then as the power went up, the flaw in the reactor design blew the thing up instead of shutting it down.

Anyway, all commercial 70's reactors were dependents on water flow through the reactor to moderate power. Should circulation stop completely, the core breaks down. Loss of cooling water was what happened in Fukushima after the tsunami took out the emergency pumps. Possibly also the decision to delay Boron poisoning of the core. If I remember it correctly.

The Soviets also had a catastrophic failure of a nuclear sub. There were really serious accidents in the West that in the end didn't not harm many, but anyway lead to a serious look at nuclear plants safety measures. The fundamental problem is that nuclear power must regulate very near a gain of 1. Above 1 and power increases exponentially, below 1 and it dies exponentially.

However, the EU would be within its rights to take the case to the International Court of Justice. The grounds for this would be the UK’s repeated commitments to pay—this was set out most importantly in the Joint Report of December 2017, which [set out](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/665869/Joint_report_on_progress_during_phase_1_of_negotiations_under_Article_50_TEU_on_the_United_Kingdom_s_orderly_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union.pdf#page=11) principles on a number of issues in the negotiations.

The European Commission said in [a statement](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-19-743_en.htm) on January 30 that “the UK would be expected to continue to honour all commitments made during EU membership” in the event of a no deal scenario.

4209,"Well, as we've discussed on this forum repeatedly, no country in Europe has demonstrated a convincing ability today to get fertility rates high enough to sustain itself without immigration.

If your average woman in Europe were giving birth to two-and-a-tenth kids in her lifetime, and had been doing so over the past few decades, then I'd expect that the governments of those countries wouldn't have a lot of concern about or interest in maintaining a solid level of immigration (barring offsetting emigration).  But that's not what the public has done.

Countries in Europe can have migration policies that change where the source of immigration is from — like, Spain could pull people from Spanish-speaking Venezuela instead of Eritrea, if that's more-palatable to her public.  And while this won't work Europe-wide, some European countries can sustain themselves by accepting immigration from elsewhere in Europe.  But if Europeans both refuse to raise children and refuse to accept immigration, it forces Europe into an inexorable path of decline.  And just saying ""we support higher fertility"" isn't good enough for a political party — they have to actually produce a solid fertility rate if they don't want immigration.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/byj58o/denmarks_elections_show_how_much_europe_is/eqivu08/,vokegaf,1560094474

What has the EU done to engender any goodwill over the past 3 years? It has acted arrogantly, looked to exploit and undermine the UK economy, refused to compromise on anything and shown enough disrespect whereby I don't think there is any chance that the UK now remains in the EU even if there is a second referendum. 

Article 50 specifically stipulates that both sides should aim to agree the future trading relationship within the two years that the treaty provides for. What did the EU do? They refused to discuss trade or many other aspects of the future relationship until the UK agreed to *their* terms for the divorce, including the Irish backstop, and intentionally dragged their heels on these negotiations. The EU ruled out trade talks from the outset to give themselves leverage in the talks, not because it was required (in fact it was pretty antithetical to the legislation), and then used this to insist on the backstop.

Why on earth would the UK want to pay the EU a bill it doesn't need to when the latter refuses to approach the divorce fairly and in good faith? The EU is too obsessed with punishing the UK and it's own survival to be reasonable partner.

Btw, water vapor is not a green house gas. H2O in gas form is nowhere near capable of stopping heat.

Methane and CO2 on the other hand, are the gasses that make sure at least a part of the reflected sun heat is held inside. If those gasses were not there, the average temperature on earth would be -18 Celsius. 

However due to the massive emmision (a lot more than your ridiculous number) we have managed to create a ‘blanket’ so thick it locks in too much heat. 

Yes, plants emit CO2 during the night. But in the day the plants take CO2 and turn it into C6H12O6. In the end, more CO2 gets retracted from the surroundings than there is emitted.

&gt;The UK could walk away from the European Union in 2019 without paying a penny, the House of Lords has said, in a report bound to raise tensions with Brussels in the run-up to Brexit talks.

&gt;The British government would have no legal obligation to either pay a €60bn (£52bn) Brexit bill mooted by the European commission or honour payments into the EU budget promised by the former prime minister David Cameron, according to analysis by the House of Lords EU financial affairs sub-committee.

&gt;In a report published on Saturday, the committee argues that the British government would be on strong legal ground if it chose to leave the EU without paying anything, adding that Brussels would have no realistic chance of getting any money.

&gt;The peers stress, however, that if the government wants goodwill from EU countries and a deal on access to European markets, agreement on the budget will be important.
&gt;“The UK appears to have a strong legal position in respect of the EU budget post-Brexit and this provides important context to the article 50 negotiations,” said Lady Falkner of Margravine, the Liberal Democrat peer who chairs the sub-committee.

&gt;“Even though we consider that the UK will not be legally obliged to pay into the EU budget after Brexit, the issue will be a prominent factor in withdrawal negotiations. The government will have to set the financial and political costs of making such payments against potential gains from other elements of the negotiations.”",,/r/europe/comments/bydbag/johnson_threatens_to_withhold_39_billionpound_eu/eqij8js/,black_gs,1560088007

&gt;In a report published on Saturday, the committee argues that the British government would be on strong legal ground if it chose to leave the EU without paying anything, adding that Brussels would have no realistic chance of getting any money.

&gt;The peers stress, however, that if the government wants goodwill from EU countries and a deal on access to European markets, agreement on the budget will be important.
&gt;“The UK appears to have a strong legal position in respect of the EU budget post-Brexit and this provides important context to the article 50 negotiations,” said Lady Falkner of Margravine, the Liberal Democrat peer who chairs the sub-committee.

&gt;“Even though we consider that the UK will not be legally obliged to pay into the EU budget after Brexit, the issue will be a prominent factor in withdrawal negotiations. The government will have to set the financial and political costs of making such payments against potential gains from other elements of the negotiations.”",,/r/europe/comments/bydbag/johnson_threatens_to_withhold_39_billionpound_eu/eqijad8/,black_gs,1560088037

4384,"&gt;The bill isn’t about future ‘maybe’s”.

It is; a substantial portion of the ""exit bill"" is in respect of future budget contributions.

&gt;What are they supposed to do, pay less pensions to UK staff?

As stated above, there are no ""UK staff"". There are only EU staff. This is something which is explicit in the EU treaties: the EU's staff such as commissioners, judges etc. are not there as representatives of their member states, but rather serve the EU as a whole.

As an employer, it's uncontroversial that the EU should contribute to the pensions of its employees, regardless of their nationality. 

&gt;Remove that bridge that was build with a 40 year credit?

Legally, the EU is not capable of borrowing money, it is obliged by treaty to operate a balanced budget. There are no projects built with credit.

&gt;So the EU should now reneg on its commitments because the UK doesn’t want to meet theirs?

Correct. The EU has no commitments to the UK on a no deal Brexit. 

Whether the EU has commitments in private law contracts to individuals, companies, etc. is another matter, and completely unaffected by Brexit. 

&gt;You know what will happen? The next time a country joins with the uk for a long term venture, like a research contract, they are going to want all the money up front. Creditors are going to want all the money up front. It will cost a lot more than 39 billion.

Unlikely in the extreme. No investor or credit rating agency thinks that the UK's negotiations with the EU have any impact whatsoever on its ability or intention to pay the debt it owes holders of bonds, which are contracts in private law, not treaties between governments. 

The UK continues to be able to raise as much money as it likes and at historically low interest rates.

Fundamentally, so long as the UK has control over its own currency, the solvency of the UK government to bond holders will never be in doubt.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/byhkp8/boris_johnson_i_wont_pay_39bn_unless_eu_gives/eqijd3c/,Taure,1560088078

WTF are you talking. For a vast majority of orthodox history, financing monasteries on Athos was a sign of power by rulers in orthodox countries since they were so tied up. 

Money flowed freely to finance buildings there. 

&gt; From the account of the Russian pilgrim Isaiah, by the end of the 15th century half of the monasteries were either Slav or Albanian. In particular, Docheiariou, Grigoriou, Ayiou Pavlou, Ayiou Dionysiou, and Chilandariou were Serbian; Karakalou and Philotheou were Albanian; Panteleïmon was Russian; Simonopetra was Bulgarian; Pantokratoros and Stavronikita were Greek; and Zographou, Kastamonitou, Xeropotamou, Koutloumousiou, Xenophontos, Iviron and Protaton did not bear any designation.

There's Russian, Albanian, Bulgarian, Serbian monasteries there.

This isn't some tiny peaceful spot. It was an important center of political power. 

They sucked up money from all over the orthodox world and now they just wanna be left alone?

Mali left in 1962 but, like Madagascar, its national currency suffered from devaluations once the currency wasn't pegged to French currency. The former decided to rejoin the CFA zone in 1984, Madagascar coined a new currency, the Malagasy france being remplaced by the current ariary.",,/r/europe/comments/byi4kh/geopolitics_60_military_interventions_since_160/eqi6eym/,CJprima,1560080146

4523,"&gt;The UK proposed a technology based border, EU didn’t like it but hasn’t come up with an alternative, it’s the EU who insist on a border.

It isn't matter of EU liking it or not. It is matter of UK not having demonstrated the proposed solution would provide adequate border security. Or to begin with that the necessary technology is realistic and practically applicable. It is one thing to say ""lets use technology"". It is another to specify what technology, estimate the reliability of said technology, to test and see that the technology really works in real world etc.

&amp;#x200B;

It is not for EU to come up for solution to a problem of UK's own making. UK is the one leaving, UK is the one who has obligation towards Ireland to not cause physical border. EU already has a (currently in place and operating) solution to the problem of not having hard border between UK and Ireland: Both of these nations being in EU Customs Union. UK is the one wanting to move away from this current working situation. Thus they are the one obligated to make sure **their** decision to change the situation doesn't cause **them** to violate **their** own treaty obligations.

&amp;#x200B;

Decisions have consequences. UK very well knows EU is treaty bound to enforce it's outer border controls. Not only towards Member States, but towards myriad of third parties EU has trade and other treaties with. Thus UK decision to leave the customs union currently in place inevitably causes the border, unless they come up with a new solution. Can't eat the cake and have it too. UK promised to Ireland in a treaty it would not take **actions** that cause border to be erected. UK leaving EU customs union is the **action** that is causing the border to be erected as a direct unavoidable consequence of all sides prior commitments. Political decisions don't happen in vacuum. Prior commitments and treaties matter.

&amp;#x200B;

UK could in view of prior commitments choose to not take the action of leaving EU Customs Union. It insists on leaving. Consequences there off are on UK.

&amp;#x200B;

Article 50 says nation has right to leave EU. It doesn't say such decision won't have (even grave and serious) consequences. Taking those consequences into account, when making said decision is responsibility of the leaving Member.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/bydbag/johnson_threatens_to_withhold_39_billionpound_eu/eqhx7nr/,variaati0,1560072926
4524,"&gt;No, what are you talking about?  
&gt;  
&gt; Do you... speak english? 

Oh you're killing me... You don't seem to know common things like quotation marks and you ask me if i can speak English... You really need to work better on your trolling.

&gt;  Force, in this context, is making someone do something that they don't  wish to do. By allowing a 17 year old to ""give up"" that is the very  opposite of force. 

Right, telling a 17 year old depressed girl that its okay to kill your self, what could go wrong?? God, you can't be that thick. 

&gt; And we arrive at the point in all internet arguments where the losing participant starts to use straw man arguments. 

Oh the irony...

&gt; I am not a sick person. 

Telling a 17 year old its perfectly fine to die is not sick??? Who knew!

&gt; You want to force a human being to stay alive, and suffer horribly, for, what, decades? 

Right... So, i use the hand of GOD and will her to live.. Would be a nice trick.. You do realize that you can't force someone to live, right??

&gt; It is so inhumanly sick that I just hope that this is some kind of sick joke or the actions of an inhuman troll. 

Here you have it, someone is sick for wanting someone to live who can't see perspective.. Must be lovely to live at your place, don't feel right?? Yea just go ahead and die.. Its sick, maybe its time for you to go seek help.  


&gt; I have seen great suffering, and sometimes the only thing that keeps me  going on is the idea that I have the option to end things if the  suffering gets too bad. 

Soo.... what i went through was anecdotal, and what you went through is somehow real?? Don't let me laugh! No one is ever forcing you to stay alive, that in of it self is one big strawman. Its not like anyone can force you to live, that doesn't mean that we as a society should be okay with people killing themselves. 

&gt; Again, you're projecting.  

Nope, that is all you too, im not the one projecting my insecurities upon others.

4547,"&gt;And that won't change when the UK leaves the EU. 

That's wishful thinking.

https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/how-brexit-could-impact-on-immigration-rules-and-the-common-travel-area-1.3776100

&gt;Now, however, a question will arise as to the viability and adequacy of the CTA in the regulation of travel between the UK and Ireland when one of these remains in the EU and the other leaves.

&gt;It now seems likely that post-Brexit Britain will move to restrict and regulate the movement of all third-party nationals into the UK, including those coming from the European Union - with the exception of Irish nationals.

&gt;The changes will bring consequences. Regarding the movement of non-EU immigrants, we may expect to see strengthened co-operation between the Irish and British authorities to make the two jurisdictions a common jurisdiction in all but name.

&gt;Citizens from other EU member states will have an unimpeded right of movement to Ireland, but no right of onward travel to the UK. The UK is now suggesting that national insurance checks, or other such inspections can prevent illegal immigration from Ireland.

&gt;However, the creation of such a back-door seems logically and practically incompatible with the regulation of movements into Britain at ports, airports or by train. In all such cases, the UK has been insistent on the need for tight controls and reinforced borders.

&gt;For instance, this is why the UK would not join the Schengen zone in the 1990s. It would be no exaggeration to say that “taking back control of our borders” was a key element in the Brexit platform.

&gt;Why should it be different for Ireland/UK movements and what might happen, say, to the putative 10,000 Spanish or Romanian migrants who might legally come to Ireland and proceed to attempt to cross the Border, if there are no border controls in place?

&gt;Indeed, would the Irish authorities themselves be comfortable with potential flows in the other direction in an unstable post-Brexit situation? Electronic surveillance will not address these issues.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/byhkp8/boris_johnson_i_wont_pay_39bn_unless_eu_gives/eqhxkl5/,Canal_Volphied,1560073230

- White Russian refugees

&gt;Alienizing your own population with different passports

Stop spreading lies! The people with grey (foreigners') passports are literally foreigners, who came here illegally during the Soviet occupation. In 1991 people of any ethnicity, whose ancestor was a citizen of Estonia, also automatically became citizens of Estonia.

4667,"This is a complete constitutional crisis. To explain recent events, yesterday two rival political groups, the Socialist Party and a pro-European coalition called ACUM decided to form the new Moldovan government after a long deadlock. These guys are political opposites on pretty much every issue but decided to work together to dislodge the leading oligarch in the country, a mafioso by the name of Plahotniuc and the Democratic Party (PD) that basically serves as his political front. Plahotniuc is of course freaking the fuck out since he understands that if he loses power he will likely end in jail very soon and is pulling all stops. 

The bastard is not stupid though and took measures to protect himself, which included getting the PD to gain as much control of Moldova's judiciary and security forces as possible, including by installing four puppets as judges on the benches of Moldova's constitutional court. The courts under his indirection have taken some truly creative decision lately, but this latest episode takes the cake. Through a *very* creative reading of the timeline for which a governing coalition has to be created following elections, the court has decided that the deadline has already passed and that the government that was formed yesterday in Parliament and invested by the President is illegitimate. 

This argument is utterly, utterly sketchy under and reading of Moldova's admittedly shoddy constitution. However the problem now is that the country's constitutional court has issued an official decision, which cannot simply be ignored. This has created an insane situation where the presidency, parliament, and government of Moldova are standing in direct opposition to the Constitutional Court and there is simply no blueprint on how the deadlock can be broken.",Moldova,/r/europe/comments/byi1ri/moldovan_court_relieves_dodon_of_duty_as_president/eqhr5ve/,quantumconfinement,1560068164

You know that quotation marks have a different meaning when used like this right?? This means the exact opposite, so no, i wasn't helped by them.

&gt; Are you serious? Are you some kind of troll?? You are absolutely,  fundamentally, wrong about that, and that is the reason for all of your  ridiculous statements. Believe me, I speak from experience, there are  things far, far worse than death. Far worse. 

Again quotation marks..... Im not forcing anyone... but hey here you go again with that stupid shit that you did not like me pulling... If anyone is using force here its you telling a 17 old its okay to give up, curl up and die, how classy of you.

&gt; I'm aware that the brain isn't fully formed until about 25, and ideally,  we would wait until then to discuss things like euthanasia, but if  someone is suffering horribly, sometimes an exception could be made. 

So you are aware of the fact that these people can not possibly know how bad it really is, yet still you encourage them to die, classy..

&gt; Your fundamental premise, that life at any cost is better than death, is the issue here. There is suffering that makes people *wish* for death. If you haven't realised that then you're either very lucky or very stupid. 

Nope it most certainly is not, the issue here is you thinking its okay for kids to die because they themselves don't seem to be able to see a light at the end of the tunnel.

With Talisker though you only get a *very* specific fusel alcohol taste, that peppery stuff. Tastes like it is supposed to be there.

Oh, and for the lurkers: For your first proper whisky, you know one that isn't bottom shelf or American, one that isn't supposed to be drowned in coke, I recommend Glenfiddich or Loch Lomond. They're mass-market, meaning don't have any edges in their flavour you'd need to learn to love, and priced very competitively. On the flip side: Never buy anything cheaper.

You'll also need, aside from the bottle, a glass and access to some soft water. This isn't about looking fancy, the way to maximise the aroma you get out of whisky is to drink it at roughly room temperature, and add a splash of soft water to kick off some chemical processes generating fresh aroma compounds. You can also add more if it's a bit harsh for your taste, as long as you're not producing gnat piss noone will even raise their eyebrows. The ideal glass for whisky is the [Glencairn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glencairn_whisky_glass), or its close cousin with a stilt.

Do you... speak english?

We're going to read your sentence again, slowly this time.

If anyone is using *force* it's you for telling a 17 year old its ok to give up.
How is allowing another person to make their own choices force?
That is the very opposite of what force is.
Force, in this context, is making someone do something that they don't wish to do.
By allowing a 17 year old to ""give up"" that is the very opposite of force.

&gt;So you are aware of the fact that these people can not possibly know how bad it really is, yet still you encourage them to die, classy..

And we arrive at the point in all internet arguments where the losing participant starts to use straw man arguments.

I never said that ""these people can not possible know how bad it really is"" thats ridiculous.
I simply made the point that *generally* someone should not be allowed to make decisions like this until their brains have fully formed, but in certain extreme cases exceptions can, and should, be made in order to reduce the suffering of an individual. Like I said, the focus of medicine should be on reducing suffering, not prolonging life.

&gt;Nope it most certainly is not

It definitely is.

&gt;In what universe do you think agreeing with a 17 year old that their lives have no use and should be ended is a good thing?

That's not what I said and even you must see it.

I said that a 17 year old who is suffering intolerably with no hope, or very little hope, of recovery should not be forced to live against their will. I did not say anything about ""encouraging"" anyone to do anything. The only person advocating force here is you.

&gt;If that is not encouraging someone to kill them selves then nothing is you sick person.

I am not a sick person. You want to force a human being to stay alive, and suffer horribly, for, what, decades? Or just until the turn 25?
That is monstrous. It is so inhumanly sick that I just hope that this is some kind of sick joke or the actions of an inhuman troll.
I have felt great suffering, I have seen great suffering, and sometimes the only thing that keeps me going on is the idea that I have the option to end things if the suffering gets too bad. The idea that sadistic monsters like you would happily lock me away for expressing that desire keeps me from availing of the psychiatric services in my area, something which is quite possibly to my detriment.

If no european level crysis emerges, we can even afford the current level of raises with very few debts (which we can actually afford since our debt rate is not that high)...

The problem is that they took several bad measures that affect the overall economy:

\- they lifted the limits for local authorities to make their own salaries which for some mayors actually means they go each month in debt just to pay the municipal salaries;

\- they banned a series of taxes (this could have been a good thing on it's own)

\- they made a series of bad modifications to the fiscal code, some of which affect the bank system and the overall credit system... They also made most of these modifications in short time spans...

\- they raised public sector benefits for ex-judges, ex-military, ex-parliamentary to idiotic levels... In their attempt to mess with the judiciary system they lowered the age of pensioning for some fields... A lot of other benefits to other groups that I've forgoten now were also provided...

4770,"&gt; One might hope that they would have learned the lesson.

Been hoping they would learn it for more than a decade. After every election/major poll I was thinking *this time they must realize they need change* and every time they continued with their old patterns, blaming it on random circumstances that caused *this particular vote* to yield poor results (treating it like an isolated incident instead of a trend), instead of understanding they were losing the trust/agreement of their voters. 


Before the EU parlament elections I spoke to some of them again, and again they seemed to completely misunderstand their situation. 

Bits from that conversation :


* Their prime argument for themselves was not any policy, but that the candidate was ""regional"" (from a city about 2 hours away), so she understands problems from people of my city ... ... again, voting for the European Parlament here...


* When asked about ""Article 13"" (or whatever it ended up being called), they stated they were firmly against it. When then asked why their representatives voted FOR the implementation, they just shrugged awkwardly and said they did, but probably wont again?

* They also couldn't tell me any real plan going forward. Not even any major environmental policy, which was and is the hot topic right now.

Now I assume part of that is to be blamed on the local campaigners and maybe not fully representative of the whole party, but it illustrates the vibe they give of on a federal level: planless, without momentum, and always willing to roll over instead of sticking up for their ideals.
It's a shame, but also a problem of their own making. I wish they will find their way back to a stronger profile and a solid policy plan soon, but for now, I don't see it.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/by8utn/germany_poll/eqhlzyu/,JimJimmington,1560063832

4903,"&gt;Unless you were against the system. A simple hiccup could make you ""undesirable"" and you would lose everything. Home, job and school for your kids.

The poor tended to not have such concerns. Those relatively well-off, having relatively sold their material needs, had them (and were the source of the overthrow of the system). If you look like examples like the miners in Romania counter-demonstrating, you can even see the poor making a stand against the ""freedom"" of the new system.

&gt;Because poor people were either locked in jail or sent to workers camps. Mentally ill people count too.

Poor people weren't jailed or sent to evil workers camps in the middle of Siberia; they did get handled by the police/authorities, but to be hired/assigned a job in a state-owned business, operating in the normal, non-camp world. If a position didn't exist in that business, it was created.

Those sent to camps were those getting politically suppressed, or plain criminals. ""Mentally-ill"" was an excuse to suppress political dissidents. But the genuinely mentally-ill got the treatment their case medically required, and was the standard of the time all over the world (primitive compared to after the standards improved, again all over the world, not to be pinned on ""soviet backwardness"", look up ""psychiatric reform""). The authorities weren't out on a mission to harm the genuinely mentally ill.

&gt;Food? You mean the most basic nutrients and the exotic food (read bananas and watermelon) being 3x more expensive and basically unreachable if you were not a member of the party?

Much better than the capitalist ""freedom"" we have, for the homeless to shift through the garbage or rely in unreliable, intermittent government or NGO soup kitchens.

Same with guaranteed housing, which you forgot to mention. Homeless in the ""free world"" have to make with cardboard ""housing"" on the streets, while in communism they had a small, often without heating, but proper, concrete or brick apartment to live into.

&gt;Clothes. Again the same thing. Very sub-par quality with zero variation. The best things were in shops that only accepted vouchers that you could buy for foreign currency.

As with the above, still better than no clothing, or clothing provided by the unreliable, intermittent good will of donators.

The specific economic problem in Germany right now is that after several screw-ups (in 2009, 2010 and 2011), German housholds are paying for something they don't get, because a significant amount of their surcharges and taxes on power is diverted into all sorts of side-gigs which have nothing to do with transitioning toward renewables.",Charlemagnia - personally vouching for /u/-ah,/r/europe/comments/bydxtq/german_press_the_greens_are_the_children_of/eqh6631/,ColourFox,1560050010

The circumstances of Minister Pompeo's visit to Berlin show how far the paths of Germany and America have diverged. Comments by Jens Thurau.

German and US diplomatic heads, Heiko Maas and Mike Pompeo (l)

German and US Heads of Diplomacy, Heiko Maas and Mike Pompeo (l)

In front of the Chancellery in Berlin, three flags were flying: American, German and European. One might think that nothing has changed in the German capital and Berlin has remained such a bit of an ""American"" city. But nothing more misleading. Nothing is left. Nothing is left of the old official German-American relations.
Author of the commentary by Jens Thurau

Author of commentary by Jens Thurau

Germany in the background

Head of State Mike Pompeo has already visited 40 countries since he held this office. He hasn't had time for Germany yet. His visit was supposed to have taken place a few weeks ago, but it was cancelled because Pompeo suddenly had to go to Iraq. It was an affront to Germany, once such an important ally, which would have been unthinkable a few years ago.

The tone of conversations was, as is customary in diplomacy, very polite - so far things have not yet come for the head of American diplomacy to hit the wrong tone in Germany, just as his president continues to do. It is as if a vivid memory of better times was the conversation between the head of German diplomacy, Maas, and Chancellor Merkel, and an American guest, about common values or Pompeo's stories about his time in Germany, when he served there as an American soldier.

But then the conflicts in Iran and Syria, the North Pipeline, the German defence budget and relations with China came to the fore. There is not a single subject on which there is a consensus of views. Worse still: one can even get the impression that the roads of Germany and America have completely separated, and strangeness has become a routine.

It is actually a matter of how zealously both sides ensure that they maintain regular contacts. Whoever has to emphasize this has nothing else to offer.
Angela Merkel and Mike Pompeo

Angela Merkel and Mike Pompeo

They live on different planets.

What Chancellor Merkel really thinks about official America was expressed very emphatically the day before during her speech at Harvard. It was a hot message for multilateralism, for climate protection, for the victory of facts over lies. Donald Trump's name has not been mentioned once, but it was mentioned in every sentence.

Transatlantic relations are now based on many personal contacts, economic and cultural exchanges. The governments of both countries live on completely different planets. For Berlin itself, Pompeo's visit went unnoticed. Once such visits were a great event. They were accompanied by enthusiastic welcome and protests. Nobody was indifferent when a guest from Washington came. Now he is planning lead silence in the government district of Berlin.

5113,"What our constitution provides:

Merkel steps down:  
The Federal President will nominate a candidate as the new Chancellor. The Bundestag will vote on the candidate and a absolute majority is needed. If the vote fails (which never happened before), there is a two weeks period where the Bundestag can nominate candidates and vote on them. There is no restrictions how many time they can vote. After this period, the Bundestag will meet again and vote on a candidate. This candidate now only needs a simple majority. The President can now decide if he wants to appoint the candidate as Chancellor or dissolve the Bundestag and announce a snap election.

Merkel calls for a vote of confidence:  
She loses the vote and asks the President for the dissolution of the Bundestag. The President can decide if he wants to go this way or nominate a new candidate for Chancellorship.

Merkel does nothing:  
The SPD will leave the coalition and their ministers will step down. Now she is governing a minority government. For every bill she need to seek a new majority. 
But there is some sketchy ways she can use to make bills to law without a majority in the Bundestag. If she calls a vote of confidence and loses, she can ask the President - instead of dissolving the Bundestag - to call for a legislative emergency. In this case the Bundesrat (which represents the federated states) would have the power to vote on legislation instead of the Bundestag. But that is only possible for single bills and has to be requested every time for a new vote. The Opposition can only counter this if they do a vote of no confidence. But in Germany it has to be constructive, which means that they have to vote on a new candidate for Chancellorship with an absolute majority to get rid of Merkel.  
But this scenario is highly unlikely. There's never been a minority government for more than a few month and also because the CDU/CSU does not have a majority in the Bundesrat, so every attempt to underline the Bundestag in the legislation process wouldn't be successful.",Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany),/r/europe/comments/by8utn/germany_poll/eqg1hc5/,b1ackb1ue,1560030363

5136,"&gt; There were 15 parties in the parliament, which effectively rendered it unable to do anything, because no block had a majority.

This is misleading BTW. It is commonly used to justify the 5 % threshold, but the reason the parliament in the Weimar Republic was blocked to much wasn't the splintering in the parliament.

It did not work out, because parties were unwilling to work with each other and unwilling to compromise. All of them served more or less as lobbyists for their interest groups (SPD - workers, Zentrum - catholics, BVP - Bavarians, DVP - rich people). Add to that the DNVP (+ small NSDAP) and the KPD, who rejected democracy and thus totally rejected cooperation. Those were the second and fourth biggest parties!

The 5 % threshold just exists to make it harder for new parties to enter parliament. For the same reason, Germany almost adopted the famously bad ""first past the post"" system in the 1960s, because the CDU wanted to take the FDP out of the game. The SPD almost agreed to it, until the FDP suggested that they could do the social-liberal coalition...

Don't get me wrong: I don't think that we should completely get rid of any threshold, but 5 % is waaay to much. 2 % would be more adequate in the current political system.

&gt; That's like running a coalition consisting of the SPÖ, ÖVP and FPÖ, which is lead by an SPÖ chancellor.

I would say that this is not quite accurate. The FPÖ is more like the DNVP, a party that rejects democracy. It is more like a coalition consisting of the SPÖ, ÖVP, the Greens and NEOS – that is difficult enough, though probably not totally impossible like SPÖ/ÖVP/FPÖ.",Germany/Hesse,/r/europe/comments/by8utn/germany_poll/eqg2wrf/,ibmthink,1560030907

This is made infinitely worse when there is no positive male authority figure (typically father) who *assuredly* sits atop them socially and can guide them properly and command respect. I would be willing to bet my testicles that most of these boys have no such figure.

Why? Because this sort of escalating violence (remember, it started out with them throwing coins at the women) is social jostling where they are trying to figure out where they sit in the social hierarchy. They will keep fighting until they come across the man (typically) that puts them in their place. Until then it's just one more escalating step to see what they can do, what they can get away with etc.

According to all the reports I have read so far, quote BBC ""a group of young men began harassing them when they discovered the women were a couple, asking them to kiss while making sexual gestures"".

Of course, the fact that they were female meant that the attackers were less worried about attacking them then had they been two, six-foot plus, beefy males for example. You could also replace women with young teens, disabled, or any other group perceived to be vulnerable when faced with four males of that age.

&amp;#x200B;

My concern is that exactly this already susceptible group soaks up all the wrong messages that are everywhere these days. Whether on Reddit, other social media platforms, newspapers, TV, video games etc. Wherever you look,  we are being told that being rude, derogatory and nasty is ok. We are being told this because that type of behaviour is not challenged, goes unopposed. At that age, for impressionable, insecure young men, the distance between mere words and physical violence isn't great and of course, by default, cowards will look for someone they perceive as no threat. 

These two women are fighting back. Lets hope that the attackers will get more than just a 'don't do it again' reprimand and that the next group of four will think twice about attacking two women on their own - whoever the women may be.",,/r/europe/comments/by00vl/london_bus_attack_four_teens_arrested_after/eqdrr55/,EgweneMalazanEmpire,1559994110

5647,"The minium wage for 2019 is 13350Kc; the median for the country is 27582Kc, that means minimum wage earners in Czechia make 48.4% of the average wage. Poverty in Europe is defined as having less than 60% national median equivalised disposable income (after social transfers). Anyone making this amount (the 4%) is pretty much guaranteed to fulfill the requirement to be considered in poverty. Even the cheapest apartments in small towns will still cost at least around 5-6000 including utilities, which is still higher than the 25-35% of gross salary guideline that should be spent on housing. And thats for an individual with no children.  

Remember, Czechia has the lowers inequality (including poverty) of the EU, and even so around 10% of the population is considered deprived.

5762,"If you're suggesting that a nearly whole nation came to Ottoman Empire as a million of people in 1860 period, and in a Turkey that was 9 times smaller than now - but somehow stayed as only a million a century and a half later, while the country got 9 times bigger in the means of population, I can't find a word really. Again, even in Circassia, where only 5-10% of us has remained by 1864, we are 800K already. Arabs are a small group compared to Circassians, even with all Syrians you got.

Also mixed ancestry doesn't mean much for a Circassian or a North Caucasian in general. Typically, if your father is a Circassian, you're a Circassian. If your mother is, than you're half Circassian, but nowadays this notion has started to change. If you're adopted etc. but don't have a blood connection, you're Circassian again. Not speaking the langauge is a sad thing, happened mostly due to Turkey's policises, but that doesn't make someone a non-Circassian as long as they self identify as one. It's the same with the Irish speaking English. And, Circassians aren't an ethnicity who would set up ethnic neighbourhoods, and especially in Turkey, they have chosen to stay invisible, and they tend to not highlight their own ethnic identity since once the policies, and now the tradition and old paranoia. Traditions are arguable, but sure most still continue to some of them. Being Circassian is still not up to how different they are from rest of Turkey, but simply self-identification so it doesn't matter much either.

That census is also based on first language. Of course, by that time, people both weren't into saying their first tongues unless they were in their villages, and many knew Turkish fully so they rather say their first langauge was Turkish. But again, that's langauge, not ethnicity.",Circassia,/r/europe/comments/bx02ra/greece_cyprus_expand_alliance_to_include_armenia/eqcvm18/,whodyougonnacall,1559978938

This guy is saying there are 154 Romanian Soldiers buried there. He has all the names on that paper. Hungarian lady say there are only 11 Romanian Soldiers. Hungarians also mentioned only one Romanian soldier on  the main entrance. 

 [https://youtu.be/i8h2UixScJ0?t=335](https://youtu.be/i8h2UixScJ0?t=335)

Hungarian authorities don't know who is buried there, as is on a foreign soil in Romania. There were also buried soldiers who died in WW2 and again Romanians have control about the cemetery. 

That's am Intl. Cemetery and not only Hungarians are buried there. Would be nice if Hungarians also take care of other graves. They will gain respect from the whole world. 

I.E. our cemeteries in Europe have only American soldiers buried like the one in Luxembourg:  [https://www.abmc.gov/multimedia/videos/luxembourg-american-cemetery](https://www.abmc.gov/multimedia/videos/luxembourg-american-cemetery)

You say that Romanian put crosses on Hungarians soldiers and marked it unknown.

If that's true, then Hungarian nationalist put trash bags on Hungarian soldier cross? Sorry. I don't buy it.  

Let's say is true...in the end they replaced a cross with another one. I don't think is a big issue as both crosses Orthodox and Catholic are Christian. If the soldier is a Muslim that would be an issue....

&amp;#x200B;

But putting a trash bag in a Cross is not the right answer by Hungarians. There is a buried person with a drama behind, who left a wife without husband, kids without father.
