5,"&gt;Poland people made a terrible mistake by allowing the executive branch to rule of the judicial branch.

You say it like it was perfect system before that PiS has tainted for worse. The juidical system was unchanged since communist regime, overhemingly hated by population and considered corrupted to the bone. And was heavily controlled by politics all the time, with personal relations between constitutional and high judges and politcians. You know how everything started? PiS wanted to invalidate choosings of new judges of constitutional tribunal that were chosen just before elections by previous government...",,/r/europe/comments/k8klvs/they_raped_me_with_truncheons_the_truth_about/gf1hing/,Marrkix,1607422329
6,"The conflict was really terrible last century, although tensions had been boiling for a long time over Catholics being subjected to a British Protestant.

(btw, these terms are religious ofc, but in Ireland they’re pretty much interchangeable with those who favour a United Ireland (nationalists) and those who prefer to be in the UK (unionists), just for the sake of clarity) 

Colonisation, the British government’s role in the Great Famine (hurrah for untouched markets), and massive preferential treatment for unionists. Fast forwarding through the division of Ireland into north and south and we arrive at 1968. Catholic nationalists are holding a civil rights movement (try and see if you can spot any parallels as we go along) over the use of gerrymandering to elect unionist politicians in nationalist areas, as well as the 90% Protestant makeup of police force, and unequal access to employment. 

Well the police start to beat the civil rights marchers. Uh oh, here comes a massive surge in IRA membership. Uh oh, here come the British army. Uh oh, the British army are colluding with unionist paramilitaries to kill unarmed, innocent civilians (Bloody Sunday 1920 AND Bloody Sunday 1972, murder of Pat Finucane). It was so bad that the Irish army considered invading Belfast to intervene. 

Anyway after years of brutal conflict and terrible bloodshed by both sides, everyone is tired of fighting. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement brings an end to the conflict and substantially better protection for Catholics, with a clause that allows for the possibility of a United Ireland through a referendum. Things are infinitely better now than they’ve been in a very long time- (some) ex UDA and IRA members work together to to promote unity, and there is a real desire amongst a lot of young people for more and more cross-community stuff. Our politicians are sadly still at each other’s throats all the time because the two major parties are heavily linked to the IRA and UDA, and you do unfortunately still have a few paramilitary killings a year.

But it’s better to focus on the good than the bad. I despise the British army for their role in the conflict, but I have total love for anyone who wants peace and integration. There is a giant wall in west Belfast that divides a catholic community from a Protestant one because they had to find a way to stop them throwing shit at each other (lol), but I dream of a day when there’s no need for that wall and it comes down. 

I suspect in the next 10-15 years we’ll have a referendum on a united Ireland. Whilst you might’ve been able to gather (somehow!) that I’d love a United Ireland, everyone fears a return to violence so I’m not optimistic it passes, but I will sure as shit happily campaign in my heavily unionist hometown, whatever the consequences.",,/r/europe/comments/k8y2cy/where_ireland_and_northern_ireland_meet/gf1hiur/,Nungie,1607422336

People tend ro prefer huge pizza and kebab portions that are not only cheap(er) but available everywhere and they will actually keep the hunger away (during and after a binge night).

Also, food with breading is not popular here - reminds about those disgusting fish fingers - and deep frying is pretty much reserved for fries. I'd also say people prefer other dead animals over poultry in general.

&amp;#x200B;

""The EU should strive for solidarity in diversity,"" writes Mateusz Morawiecki in his original text, which appeared on Monday evening in the German daily ""Handelsblatt"", devoted to economic issues. Before the EU summit, the prime minister explains Poland's position in the budget dispute Morawiecki on the EU budget  ""The way in which fiscal conditionality as regards the rule of law is to be incorporated into the regulation not only raises serious concerns about the legal basis of this mechanism, but also undermines the principles of trust and sincere cooperation between Member States and the Union institutions.

The current bypassing the Treaties is creating a state of immense legal uncertainty. Is this what we want to offer our citizens in response to the dramatic plight into which the pandemic has pushed them? Uncertainty and political disputes? "" - Mateusz Morawiecki asks.  ""A serious problem and a paradox of the modern EU is the fact that, despite the constant emphasis on the importance of diversity, it cannot accept the diversity of legal and constitutional systems rooted in the traditions of different countries.

The community consists of different models of democracy, because European nations differ from each other"" - emphasizes the Prime Minister in the text published in ""Handelsblatt"".  ""The French V Republic and West Germany are not similar to each other, it is natural, because one was created by the will of the French people, and the other by the will of the German nation. Italians or Poles, Portuguese or Czechs have the right to be different. The Union should strive for to solidarity in diversity, because only in this way will its unity be creative and beneficial. After all, diversity is a European wealth, not a curse ""- he adds.

The head of the Polish government declares that ""we demand equality and respect for treaties"". The Union cannot question its own rules or change them at the political request of some states. The law on the protection of the EU's budgetary interests is secondary to the Treaty on European Union, so it cannot circumvent, replace or modify the rules set out in the Treaty. The rule of law mechanism in the Regulation is a circumvention, in a way 'overwriting' the law over the Treaty, namely over Art. 7 TEU.

**It must be said clearly - a mechanism designed to protect the respect of the rule of law by the Member States is in itself a circumvention of EU law, and therefore a threat to the rule of law ""- emphasizes the Prime Minister.**  ""Within the EU, there are often disputes, divergent positions, but we also have mechanisms that have always led to agreements. I believe that we are able to come up with a solution that respects the letter and spirit of the treaties. Or maybe it is the game of some 'actors who care about that the European Reconstruction Fund does not really start to work because they do not want to contribute to the common budget, moreover, by using the common European market? - writes the prime minister.

And he adds: ""Today we all have one goal and this goal - the economic reconstruction of Europe - must be a beacon for us. The mechanism shaped in the present way opens the door to dangerous interpretations. It gives great power and discretion to entities without democratic legitimacy. Or at least to entities with significant ' a democratic deficit 'compared to national parliaments. This is a great threat to every member state and the future of the entire Union. Those who think they are immune to it do not realize how much freedom this mechanism allows.

**""It is not difficult to imagine a situation that some political power in the EU will not like the political or economic reform introduced in a given Member State. It is enough to call this reform in the media and in the European Parliament as a violation of the rule of law and the path to the threat of being cut off from EU funds ""- notices Mateusz Morawiecki and asks -"" We really want it? Admitting such arbitrariness? Creation of such centrifugal forces that this regulation would trigger? "".**

""Such a solution gives unbelievably great opportunities to exert political pressure on the course of affairs in the domestic politics of the member states. I emphasize: **in domestic politics**. Today this arbitrary, politically motivated mechanism is aimed at Poland, but what guarantee do we have that tomorrow it will not be targeted against other a state that will not want to submit to the political will of the Brussels institutions? The treaties respect and protect sovereignty, while the new mechanism violates it and seriously restricts it, ""writes the prime minister.

""Lack of consent to such a state of affairs, i.e. a veto, does not weaken the EU. It is a mechanism embedded in the reality of EU structures, in line with the spirit of the Community and its democratic nature. It is a safety valve that is essential for the existence of the Union. It is a method of protecting a compromise and a barrier. against imposing their will by the stronger ones. This confirms that the voice of every member state is equally important ""- he notes.

At the end of the publication in ""Handelsblatt"", Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki recalls: ""Charles de Gaulle once said that the future is sacrificed in the name of the present only because you are incapable of saying 'no'.""

**And he emphasizes: ""Poland feels jointly responsible for the future of Europe. That is why our 'no' to the mechanism proposed today is also a 'yes' to a Europe truly united in diversity, freedom, equality and solidarity"".**",,/r/europe/comments/k8z528/mateusz_morawiecki_polish_pm_the_veto_does_not/gf144pn/,TyrantfromPoland,1607409103

This was apparently the worst government in the history of Poland. Nearly the entire opposition left of PiS unite against them in an election. Poland had bigger protests than in the 1980s against communism.

And yet PiS stayed in power. 8 million people voted for PiS in parliamentary elections in 2019, the most in history for a single party. In a country where the population is falling for 25 years. This was after 5 years of ""destruction"" of the country. 

Duda in 2020 also beat the record for most Presidential votes in the history of the country, beating every predecessor including Walesa who got 75% of the vote in 1990.

470,"&gt; But the EU is not willing to become strong enough to defend itself

Combined (sans UK), the EU spends over 220€ billion on its militaries every year, has 1.4 million active military personnel, over 500 ships, 7000 tanks, 13000 armoured fighting vehicles, 9000 pieces of artillery, 750 attack helicopters, 1500 fighters/bombers, and over 300 nuclear warheads.  
Those aren't numbers for fighting a war, those are numbers for fighting a world war.  

It already can defend itself. The problem comes when people conflate defence with power projection. Keep in mind that, currently, there is only one country that can truly project power on a global scale, the US, and the EU has neither the need nor the will to copy its interventionist foreign policy.

And lastly, defence against whom?  

* China is not the EU's enemy. Rival, sure, but not enemy. It's the US's enemy.
* The US? Well, [over a third of the entire world's military spending is done by the US](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion), so there's no beating them.  
* Russia? In a conventional war, Russia could take the Baltics (even with NATO and the US, the Baltics are just too disadvantaged to hold against Russia's invasion), but that's it. Eventually, the EU could liberate them, as any prolonged conflict vastly favours the EU due to its higher population, wealth, diplomatic relations, and industrial capacity.",Slovenia,/r/europe/comments/k8k4jq/where_belgium_bulgaria_denmark_germany_estonia/gf0jsgt/,ShEsHy,1607396030

People say that their rise is scary and should be investigated, that for sure it's Russia that massively boosted them (there is evidence for this), but take into account how utterly abissimal the attendance rate was. 10% of 30% is only 3%, and considering how loud these guys are I think that most of their potential electorate has been depleted, and is at around 5% of the total population.

What scares me, truly, is how the diaspora voted. Nearly a quarter voted for them. I mean, how flatbrained do you have to be to vote for a party which wants to get Romania out of the EU, while you work in Italy, Germany or Spain?

I think the most guilty for this is the press. Most of it is owned by felons, showing propaganda for PSD mostly (the shit-made kind), but even the most neutral ones didn't report on these guys.

601,"&gt;We are for a good reason a nation build on compromises.

That's not what I'm describing, that's what we still have: 2 parties making compromises, and if we're honest, quite a golden age for social-democratic policy in some regards. But add several more parties to that and a potential Jamaica coalition, and that's gone. No one will be happy, everyone will feel frustrated and positions will become hardened and extreme. 

I don't dislike compromise. The problem the Greens present is that they're compromising a compromise they've made with the people for which climate is the number one issue. You have to take their position to the negotiating table and see how much you can get for them if you want their vote again. But if you water their demands down and then compromise the watered down version further, they're gone.

Take the situation with Dannröder Forst. The national party fully knows and understands that they're splitting something they cannot allow to be split if they want real and actual power. The regional party leadership is confronted with legality and wants to keep it's power. This local realpolitik maneuver will cost the party more than it can afford though, breaking the Landescoalition would be a necessary move to become Chancellor and not whither under the exact same issue *on a national level* next time. Because that's what's going to happen when you enter a coalition with the CDU: they're going to make you do way worse than send troops to Afghanistan. They're going to make you repudiate and fight fridays for future, extinction rebellion and any resistance to natural destruction for construction projects. 

Germany isn't Badenwürtenberg, you can't hope to win against the environmental movement, you can only possibly win for them. But to win for them, you have to ignore Kretschmeier and at least start the negotiation from a radical position before you reach a compromise you can sell to your base *and* the young voters that have no party affiliation. 

Or do you want to live in a Germany governed by a coalition of either Jamaika+SPD or Greens-SPD-FDP-Linke-NEOS that barely managed to win against CDU and AfD? Because that's what we're getting afterwards if you fuck the next one up.

Since when we have equal taxation we also need equal representation. Something which we currently not have. Even ignoring the Vetos smaller countries have a disproportional large representation in pretty much every EU institution. For example the EU parliament currently has 705 members representing 447.67 million citizens. Malta with only half a million citizens (less than many larger cities in other EU countries) elects 6 of the parliament members.

Also unlike the negotiated borders of the 19th and 20th centuries they aren’t straight lines.

899,"&gt;Bernadotte would later lead Sweden against Napoleon during the War of the Sixth Coalition, and took Norway from Denmark (creating a personal union that lasted for 91 years) after the Napoleonic Wars as compensation for losing Finland.

Norway had already declared independence and sovereignty with its own modern constitution when Sweden decided to go to war in July 1814. When the Convention of Moss was negotiated in August, Bernadotte had to recognise the 1814 Constitution in order to make a cease-fire feasible. The Norwegian Parliament (the Storting) did not elect him King until November 4th. If the Treaty of Kiel actually had been carried out, then ""took Norway from Denmark"" would be correct, but this is not what happened.

It was not like the personal union gave Bernadotte much power in Norway either. He was constantly on the losing side in battles with the Storting during his reign (the Storting has since the beginning  been the most powerful of the three branches of government). Demands of absolute veto powers and the right to rule by decree among other things (powers I assume he enjoyed in Sweden) were rejected by the Storting every session. After 91 years, the union was finally dissolved when King Oscar II was unable to form a cabinet that the Storting would not force to immediately resign.",Norway,/r/europe/comments/k8dcnv/the_point_were_sweden_and_france_met_18151974/geytoot/,Thomassg91,1607365524

In the first one the far right PRM was ousted from the parliament and never came back.  Other far right parties like PNG, New Right and PRU also didn't make it. Not even in the lowest turnout.  So this result caught many offguard.

Also, according to internatinal law, countries are not permitted to conduct research and economic activities in disputed areas (if these areas are still somehow disputed) So by default, Turkey violates international law by sending the research ship to those waters. Can we blame Turkey for that?

If the situation is unique then it can only be resolved in the ICJ which is what Greece has been asking and Turkey has been rejecting since the 70s. 

Turkey does not want to abide by the laws. Fullstop. You are claiming areas that you have no legal right to claim under any law, whether you signed it or not. What exactly is Turkey doing south of Crete? I mean, seriously, wtf? You're projecting military power and try to drive Greece to negotiations at gunpoint.

I am not sure what you are trying to say, rule of law index shows many different aspects of rule of law.

Rule of law isnt on and off thing, it has many aspects to it, its a scale, for example Italy is better then Poland at some aspects and worse in others.
You can say that EU doesnt have problem with Italy because they arent bad  in aspects  EU cares about(which is stupid in my opinion) but some of things EU criticised Poland for like influence on juidicary  are also problem in Croatia and Bulgaria, Croatia and Bulgaria is worse then Poland in ""Government powers are effectively limited by the judiciary"" aspect, and while you may say Bulgaria is getting a pass because they are improving, in case of Croatia it isnt true, they are also getting worse.

France decision wont just affect extremists though. 
Fact is that France is sliding down in the rule of law index in ""Constraints on Government Powers"" and in ""fundamental rights"" in both this aspects France is below european average.

Well it works when it suits you does it?

&gt; So what did NATO do in Yugoslavia, the place where Russian-backed Serbs committed a genocide

Do you also blame russians for eating your food? Wtf? How were they backed by russia?!

&gt; until the world essentially begged NATO to intervene?

No one begged anyone to intervene. 
If it was the case, why don’t you intervene in the barbaric killings of gays and women in Saudi Arabia? Or their genocide in Yemen? 
I’ll tell you: hypocrisy. 

&gt; And in Libya, a place with an ongoing civil war against a ruthless totalitarian dictator

The civil war started thanks to foreign intervention. Same fucking approach as in dozens of countries including Ukraine:
1. Seek for civil unrest issues
2. Put fuel into the fire
3. Support “freedom fighters” (usually extremists)
4. Intervene militarily 
5. Loot

&gt; where the UN Security Council asked states to intervene? 

Lies. 
Establishing no fly zone - yes. 
Bombing and using special forces? How asked NATO for that?

&gt; What was so bad about that intervention? 

The fact that they are still having civil war and defacto a failed state after almost 10 years. 

&gt; What do you think would have happened at that point if they hadn't intervened?

Its not for you to decide. Who pointed you?

&gt; Please, don't be so edgy with your armchair geopolitics expert analyses...

Look who is talking. Armchair general filled with estonian tv propaganda (we are fighting dictators and bringing the fruits of civilization to theses barbaric iraqis and libyans). Sftu. 

&gt; Wtf is that?

The context is that this school was to be reconstructed to host US Navy soldiers. 

&gt; Against a hostile imperialistic dictator... Why would you defend such a person?

Why are you thinking for me or putting words in my mouth? Did I defend anyone? Please dont use these cheap propaganda tricks on me. 

Is this really your answer? “Imperialistic dictator”. Really? Not oil huh?
So taking aside the fact that it was ILLEGAL INVASION am I able to use such bullshit excuses about Ukraine too? Like protecting russians from [nazis](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/neo-nazis-far-right-ukraine/)

Please don’t waste my time. 

&gt; Because besides Iraq (which I grant you was indeed an illegal war, or at least, the initial intervention was), our interventions are legal. 

So our interventions (besides Ukraine) are also legal. All is good mate!

&gt; Not only, they are essentially always against sick authoritarian regimes.

Okay so at one point we can also intervene if we decide that a certain regime does not meet some made up standards. Like lets say Poland now. Can we intervene with bombings because we do not agree with their stance on women rights? What about China? Saudi arabia again? Why dont you intervene? Because its just an excuse thats why. 

&gt; You are simply stealing territory like the thief country Russia is...

dont fuck with us and you wont loose anything. 

&gt; No, some of us are better than others because we don't support hostile imperialistic dictatorships like Russia.

They are buying a lot of subs.They want 12 subs by 2024 (More than the UK or France have).But nothing has been won by any French contractor yet besides lots of talks.

They currently use German subs variants and are having new ones entering service that South Korea has built. So the likelihood they will move from that now in a big way is unlikely but of course, possible.

The South Koreans have built/building the German 209 subs. The Germans lost that contract to SK. They got annoyed and refused SK the export license for the more advanced 214 (these ones in the article). Their hope was to sell them instead with cheaper Turkish manufacturing and be able to compete with SK. They again lost to SK. 

But now Indonesia is looking at it [again](https://thediplomat.com/2020/04/indonesia-is-reconsidering-contract-with-south-korea-for-3-diesel-electric-submarines/) , alongside the French proposal probably.

The simple fact is that Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Greece were neither paid in full nor ever agreed to write off the debt. The moneys owed are enormous, but that's because the damage caused in the war was enormous. That needs to be either paid or renegotiated. Or at least, would need to be in a lawful world.",,/r/europe/comments/k8863y/on_this_day_50_years_ago_during_his_visit_to/gexoa0s/,7elevenses,1607343314

Moreover, the extreme elements of PSD were silenced: Mitraliera Radulescu was removed. Nicolicea, Iordache, Carmen Dan and Dancila were cut from the parliamentary lists.

Before PSD, they were PRM voters.

Then there's also, as you know, the low voter turnout.

And nobody really represent those people: the hard-core christians, pro traditional family values and anti-vaxxers and covid-denialists, who poured their anger of being silenced and mocked on TV for their beliefs by voting...

please tell me more of what you learned from you're EU4 playthrough.

I would suggest brushing up on your reading comprehension. firstly, parts of Latvia and Estonia we're under Polish rule and obviously russian rule, just like lithuania. 

Secondly, historically we were religiously pluralistic, the current catholic majority is a result of WWII, since jews were basically eradicated and most protestants emigrated either to the Americas or Germany. 

Thirdly, do you really not see the parallels? starting point nordic crusades, centuries under a different language speaking upper class, russian empire, brief independence during the wars, soviet occupation etc.

1389,"*Explanation:*   
Self-employed workers are those workers who, working on their own account or with one or a few partners or in cooperative, hold the type of jobs defined as a ""self-employment jobs."" i.e. jobs where the remuneration is directly dependent upon the profits derived from the goods and services produced. 

Self-employed workers include four sub-categories of employers, own-account workers, members of producers' cooperatives, and contributing family workers.

*Development Relevance:*   
Breaking down employment information by status in employment provides a statistical basis for describing workers' behaviour and conditions of work, and for defining an individual's socio-economic group. 

A high proportion of wage and salaried workers in a country can signify advanced economic development. If the proportion of own-account workers (self-employed without hired employees) is sizeable, it may be an indication of a large agriculture sector and low growth in the formal economy. A high proportion of contributing family workers — generally unpaid, although compensation might come indirectly in the form of family income — may indicate weak development, little job growth, and often a large rural economy. 

Each status group faces different economic risks, and contributing family workers and own-account workers are the most vulnerable - and therefore the most likely to fall into poverty. They are the least likely to have formal work arrangements, are the least likely to have social protection and safety nets to guard against economic shocks, and often are incapable of generating sufficient savings to offset these shocks.

And that other members would have to attack another member. And there is no mechanism in the treaty for suspension or expulsion, quite deliberately.

You could make an argument that under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties Turkey could be considered in severe material breach of the treaty and thus no longer be a party to its protections, but diplomats would bicker and argue for a long time. In the meantime, Greeks would be dying.

1455,"&gt;Fine the first two Spanish Republics collapsed into authoritarian regimes rather quickly.

Er, my whole point is that the first Spanish Republic did not ""collapse into an authoritarian regime"". The regime that replaced it wasn't authoritarian by any reasonable definition of the term. It was a constitutional monarchy, even if a flawed one.

&gt;it’s kind of notable that Spain has only been a Republic since 1972

First of all, Spain isn't a Republic even now, but a constitutional, democratic monarchy. Secondly, the current constitution was introduced in 1978, not 1972. In 1972, Franco was still pretty much in charge, and he didn't die until 1975.

As I said, I still don't quite understand what point you're trying to make and why you need to be so unnecessarily belligerent, bordering on the insulting, while doing it.

With COVID-19 restrictions in full effect and changes in travel preferences, the most substantial falls in the number of commercial flights were recorded in April (-91% compared with the same month in 2019), May (-90%) and June (-84%).

During the peak summer months, there was only a partial recovery, with falls of 64% in July and 53% in August, with further decreases observed in September (-59%) and October (-62%).

Although the extent of the impact and path to recovery varies across EU Member States, the largest decrease in the number of commercial flights was observed in April in 21 Member States, while May recorded the largest decrease in the remaining 6 EU Member States.

**Frankfurt/Main airport: highest drop in the number of commercial flights in 2020**

Between January and October 2020, a vast majority of EU airports registered a dramatic decrease in the number of commercial flights compared with the same period last year.

The largest decreases in the number of commercial flights were recorded in major European air transport hubs: Frankfurt/Main (-251 900 commercial flights, -58%), Paris/Charles de Gaulle (-232 200, -55%), Amsterdam/Schiphol (-225 700, -53%), München (-218 300, -63%) and Madrid/Barajas (-212 800, -60%).",Romania,/r/europe/comments/k8brif/commercial_air_transport_passengers_freight_and/gex63au/,filosoful,1607324500

Obama's famous campaign shot was an example of a similar posterization and vectorization and hit legal issues once it became famous and the copyright holder of the original work sought compensation.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_%22Hope%22_poster

&gt;The Barack Obama ""Hope"" poster is an image of Barack Obama designed by artist Shepard Fairey, which was widely described as iconic and came to represent his 2008 presidential campaign.[1][2] It consists of a stylized stencil portrait of Obama in solid red, beige and (light and dark) blue, with the word ""progress"", ""hope"" or ""change"" below (and other words in some versions).
&gt;
&gt;The design was created in one day and printed first as a street poster. It was then more widely distributed—both as a digital image and other paraphernalia—during the 2008 election season, initially independent of, but with the approval from, the official Obama campaign.[3] The image became one of the most widely recognized symbols of Obama's campaign message, spawning many variations and imitations, including some commissioned by the Obama campaign. This led The Guardian's Laura Barton to proclaim that the image ""acquired the kind of instant recognition of Jim Fitzpatrick's Che Guevara poster, and is surely set to grace T-shirts, coffee mugs and the walls of student bedrooms in the years to come.""[4]
&gt;
&gt;In January 2009, after Obama had won the election, Fairey's mixed-media stenciled portrait version of the image was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution for its National Portrait Gallery. Later in January 2009, the photograph on which Fairey based the poster was revealed: an April 2006[5] shot by former Associated Press freelance photographer Mannie Garcia. In response to claims by the Associated Press for compensation, Fairey sued for a declaratory judgment that his poster was a fair use of the original photograph. The parties settled out of court in January 2011, with details of the settlement remaining confidential.
&gt;
&gt;On February 29, 2012, Fairey pleaded guilty in a New York federal court to destroying and fabricating documents during his legal battle with the Associated Press. Fairey had sued the news service in 2008 after it claimed that the famous poster was based on one of its photos. Fairey claimed that he used a different photograph for the poster. But he admitted that, in fact, he was wrong and tried to hide the error by destroying documents and manufacturing others, which is the source of the one count of criminal contempt to which he pleaded guilty.[6] In September, Fairey was sentenced to two years of probation, 300 hours of community service, and a fine of $25,000.[7] 

The issue here is one of whether or not the new creation is a [derivative work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work) or not.

That being said, I've no idea where the original photo came from.  It may be that it is released into the public domain or is available under some sort of permissive license.

The [oldest instance that tineye.com can find of it is a low-resolution version](https://tineye.com/search/51650bb3e6eb599b8513769db9576be7901ea6d2?sort=crawl_date&amp;order=asc&amp;page=1) on ""24warez.ru"" in March 2013.

A bit of poking around finds someone on Reddit linking to [this image](http://www.vallankumous.org/blogi/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/1135266174529.jpeg) which is from [this May 2011 blog post](http://www.vallankumous.org/blogi/page/22/) that happened five days after the incident apparently took place.  That appears to credit ""HS"" (though I wouldn't be surprised if the author didn't have rights to use it on his blog either), which I assume is [Helsingin Sanomat](https://www.hs.fi/).

&gt;Helsingin Sanomat (approx.: Helsinki times/news), abbreviated HS and colloquially known as Hesari, is the largest subscription newspaper in Finland and the Nordic countries, owned by Sanoma. Except after certain holidays, it is published daily. Its name derives from that of the Finnish capital, Helsinki, where it is published.

In Spain, there was no foreign power imposing anything. The dictator died peacefully, and Spain had to rely exclusively on itself to evolve politically.

During the Transition, a very delicate situation ensued during which a complete rejection of the Francoist ideology could have potentially provoked such levels of violence that the democratization process could have been stopped. That allowed fascism to survive politically.

In fact, while the Transition was usually labelled as peaceful, it was actually plagued with political violence, with a death toll which reached the three digits.

1822,"Boris Johnson’s cabinet on Sunday formed a protective circle around the UK prime minister, insisting they would back him if he opted for a no-deal Brexit and plunged the country into renewed economic uncertainty.

The apparent insouciance of Mr Johnson’s ministers, including former Remainers, about the prospect of a no-deal end to Britain’s relationship with the EU on January 1 has alarmed business leaders, with some sectors warning of an impending catastrophe.

But over the weekend, as Brexit trade talks ran aground, ministers lined up to tell the Sunday Times newspaper that the cabinet was “100 per cent” behind the prime minister. Aides were barred from speaking to the press: the message to Brussels was “don’t mess with us”.

Privately, pro-Remain ministers say they would not be so sanguine if they were not convinced that Mr Johnson was going to agree a deal. Some Treasury officials remain equally certain that the paroxysms in the negotiations are a prelude to a deal.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak has privately made it clear to the prime minister what is at stake economically if no trade deal is in place, even if publicly he insists the country could cope.

Michael Gove, Cabinet Office minister, has warned that a disorderly Brexit would fuel demands for Scottish independence, as well as worsening what is already expected to be chaos at the EU border on January 1.



But even those close to Mr Johnson are not certain he will heed the political and economic warnings. For a prime minister with a lack of interest in detail and a passionate interest in notions of “sovereignty” he is keeping Brussels and his own supporters guessing to the last minute.

Private polling shown to the prime minister suggests that the public would be willing to support a no-deal exit, according to Number 10 insiders, “provided we can show we were standing up for our sovereignty”. Mr Johnson’s fascination for Winston Churchill standing alone in 1940 is well known.

Peter Mandelson, former Labour minister and EU trade commissioner, thinks there will be a deal, but said: “I think he’s divided in his own mind where the national interest lies. A bit of him does think that national interest lies in sovereignty and making our own way in the world.”

The economic implications of no deal were set out by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility last month, which said it would knock 2 per cent off gross domestic product next year — about £40bn — and that 300,000 people would pay with their jobs by next summer.

“I think the long-term effects would be larger than the long-term effects of Covid,” Andrew Bailey, Bank of England governor, told the Treasury select committee last month. Josh Hardie, deputy head of the CBI employers’ organisation, said “things look very stark” without a deal.

The impact on individual sectors would also be grave, as tariffs and quotas were laid on top of the red tape that has already been spawned by Mr Johnson’s decision to take Britain out of the customs union and single market.


Minette Batters, head of the National Farmers Union, has warned the impact on the farming sector would be “catastrophic” — lamb producers could face tariffs of 40 per cent on their exports — while carmakers speak of a “no-deal Brexit disaster” with 10 per cent tariffs facing that sector.

The European Commission has also warned that “failing to reach an agreement would lead to disruptions that would be more far-reaching” than the inevitable changes that come with Britain leaving the single market. 

Failure would also jeopardise co-operation between EU and UK researchers in vital areas such as healthcare, while scuppering arrangements intended to ensure cross-border workers can claim benefits and plan for their retirement. 

The draft deal would also help smooth customs checks, uphold a cross-border energy market and ensure trade in civil nuclear materials can continue. Outside of economic matters, a collapse in the talks would threaten a planned security partnership. 

Ultimately, if no deal is secured this week, Mr Johnson will find himself back in Brussels in the coming years trying to strike patchwork deals with the EU and probably a trade deal too. Rather than turning a page on Brexit, the saga would continue.

The drama at the negotiating table might well be interpreted as the inevitable showdown before Mr Johnson strikes a deal, as he seeks to delete “eleventh hour” demands from the EU to demonstrate he is fighting to the end. He needs to be able to sell a deal to his own party.

David Gauke, a former cabinet minister, wrote on the ConservativeHome website: “The Conservative party has become less disciplined and more comfortable with the politics of protest. In some respects, Boris Johnson is a natural leader for such a party — a columnist and controversialist; an insurgent rather than an administrator.”",.,/r/europe/comments/k834sp/insurgent_boris_johnson_faces_moment_of_truth_on/gevpv18/,half-spin,1607293059

Covid-19 &amp; Lockdown news: Many discussions about the (lack of) relaxations of the lockdown measures, as infection and hospitalisation rates continue to slowly go down.

* Last week friday [some relaxations](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/k36f01/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20201129/ge1dbdm/) were announced. According to some, these didn't go far enough. The French-speaking liberal party [MR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouvement_R%C3%A9formateur) has presented itself as the main political representative for those who want more freedom. They draw inspiration from France, where more social contacts are allowed with the winter holidays.
* Federal Minister of Health [Frank Vandenbroucke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vandenbroucke_\(politician\)) (sp.a) however doesn't budge and keeps the strict line. Some controversy rose from an interview with Vandenbroucke where he defended the closing and reopening of the shops. In the interview he stated that the shops themselves were not a risk, but that a ""shock effect"" was necessairy. The interview didn't cause much commotion until federal opposition party [N-VA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Flemish_Alliance) shared a clip on their socials with only the ""shock effect"" fragment.
* Many seemed to understand from the video fragment that closing the shops was not necessairy but they were only closed for some psychological effect. Vandenbroucke was accused of sacrificing the self-employed for no good reason. The above mentioned MR, a coalition partner of Vandenbroucke's [sp.a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialistische_Partij_Anders), joined in on the protest, mostly lead by former Minister of Self-Employed and SMEs [Denis Ducarme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Ducarme).
* Vandenbroucke defended himself by clarifying his statements, explaining that the ""shock effect"" referred to limiting reasons to leave the house as much as possible to prevent social interactions. He released internal documents which showed that the measure was recommended by most scientists in the security council and that the alternative was instating a perimeter like in France.
* The first vaccines are planned for 5 Januari. Inhabitants and care workers for elderly care homes are given first priority. A large part of the Belgian Covid-19 death toll happened in elderly care centers. Read more [here](https://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-releases-coronavirus-vaccination-plans/).
* Belgium has also caught some international attention due to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine being produced in [Puurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puurs).

Other news:

* Hungarian MEP [József Szájer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B3zsef_Sz%C3%A1jer) got caught on a sex party during lockdown. You know the story, I'm not going to repeat the whole yadda yadda.
* The [Brussels Regional Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_and_government_of_the_Brussels-Capital_Region#Composition_2019%E2%80%93present) has presented its plans for a km charge within [the Capital-Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels). In exchange the general road tax gets abolished for inhabitants of Brussels. This of course doesn't count for people living in the other two regions of Belgium, so it's needless to say that people and politicians in [Flanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemish_Region) and [Wallonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallonia) are not happy about it.

As I said, ICJ was about declaration of independence which in itself is legal, but not only in Kosovo issue but anywhere on the Earth. There is literally no rule against declaring an independence declaration. It was a failed by Serbian legal team back then. The ICJ did not ruled about legality of Kosovo secession since that was not the question that Serbia asked. 

&gt; Yet Crimea did not declare independence. It was covertly invaded by Russia, whose forces staged a referendum there, which was of course illegitimate by default.

As I am aware there was a referendum. And you can't say that the majority of population there was against joining Russia. But nevertheless I agree with you that Crimea annexation was illegal. But the declaration of independence was legal... if you ask ICJ. Same rule for Crimea. And yet it was against the international law. 

&gt; Funny, considering the court literally said that their declaration of independence was not in violation of international law.

I say it again. Anyone can declare independence, anywhere on the Earth. And it's legal. It's free speech and free will of people. But it's against international law. There are a lot of examples all around the world that would like independence. For example, independence of Abkhazia is legal, people want independence and that's it. But It's against international law, against UN that recognize it as part of Georgia, it's against Georgian laws and constitution. UN sees Kosovo as part of Serbia. And the UN rules are not to bi broken unilaterally, it's really dangerous. As I said before, Serbia wanted to accept the greatest possible autonomy for Kosovo. 

&gt; ICJ also said that it was not in violation of UN resolutions. And Serbian law does not apply here.

As I said it did not. Go read the decision. The UN still sees Kosovo as part of Serbia. I think we can agree on that. 

&gt; So your argument is that Kosovo cannot declare independence because otherwise Serbia might want to wage war against it? That is quite telling.

No. But I think if Kosovo has the right to secede that the Serbian areas in Kosovo have also the right to remain in Serbia. 

&gt; Ah, so now you concede.

What? I'm telling you about the EU. Spain, Greece, Slovakia, Romania and Cyprus do not recognize Kosovo and not going to anytime soon. Not until Serbia recognize it itself. 

&gt; No, it didn't, it just stole foreign territory and blabbered about ""the Kosovo precedent""...

So you telling me that Russia used it as a precedent? That's the point. I'm telling you again, since Serbia wanted to give Kosovo the greatest possible autonomy (something like Denmark - Greenland situation) it was a really bad decision that divided the world and the EU itself and created a problem. There was no more Milosevic or anything when Kosovo declared independence. Serbia had a democratic proEU government back than. And Kosovo issue came and bite everyone in the ass in Ukraine and Georgia. 

&gt; No, they had age-old Russian imperialism in mind.

Whatever. They used Kosovo as precedent and that's it. They would never pull a Crimea thing if Kosovo never happened. 

&gt; And how many others have felt that these two are absolutely the same?

All of them? It was so obvious. 

&gt; It's not a problem, but you are kind of stereotypical with your statements. I mean, I get that your state is very much against Kosovo getting independence, but the Serbian arguments against it are age-old and just factually incorrect. You guys do not even bother to understand that you lost miserably in court and also in international opinion and you are literally misinterpreting what the courts said...

Why would Serbia recognize Kosovo? What are we going to get from it? I'm talking about how the Kosovo issue fueled other separatist movements and it's going to be more of it I bet. Just look at it, if it is all legal why it's such an issue? The Kosovo issue is something that divides Europe and is a problem. If you are not connecting Ukraine and Georgia with Kosovo I don't know. Serbia was willing to do a huge compromise but Kosovo declared independence and we are not going to accept it. The UN considers Kosovo as part of Serbia and frankly the UN is still the last thing that stands between international chaos and declaring independence left and right.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/k7sfph/fixed_nationality_of_the_largest_group_of/geuev1y/,Chadomir,1607271914

&gt;he magically gifts Crimea to Ukraine

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_transfer_of_Crimea

On 19 February 1954, the **Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union** issued a decree transferring the Crimean Oblast from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to the Ukrainian SSR. 

&gt;It was against the constitution of the Soviet Union (you can’t just take chunks out of one country and give it to another) but obviously in the Soviet Union it was hard to go against the leader of the communist party.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidium_of_the_Supreme_Soviet 

The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (Russian: Президиум Верховного Совета or Prezidium Verkhovnogo Soveta) was a body of state power in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).[1] The presidium was elected by joint session of both houses of the Supreme Soviet to act on its behalf while the Supreme Soviet was not in session. By the 1936 and 1977 Soviet Constitution the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet served as the collective head of state of the USSR.[2] In all its activities, the Presidium was accountable to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.[1]

2302,"The argument that heredity is relevant in this discussion at all is arguing that states and societies should be treated as if the basic ideas surrounding property inheritance (as if the temples of the Egyptian Kingdoms could be equated to a piece of arable land)  apply in the slightest. This is just a call to apply an irrelevant principle. Even if it were, those in and around Egypt would still be the closest relatives.

If the argument is based on cultural heritage, there exists no sensible metric or method to define these beyond how much the locals care. And it certainly can't be done best by outsiders. The European colonial argument always boils down to ""the locals started caring about archaeology 100 years after us, so it was fair game then"" which is very clearly a bait-and-switch. When it comes to this subject, European 18th and 19th century fetishization of antiquity was no different from the Roman imperial displays of conquest and grandeur, which brought three similar obelisks nearby to Rome and Constantinople as well.

The assertion that historical artifacts should be treated as property invariably devolves into increasingly awful characterizations of how ownership of said property is to be recognized. That's what drives the discussion to racism. And if you argue long enough, (intentionally or otherwise) it becomes obvious almost every time.

The only valid starting point for the status of historical value is the study and protection of human history, which the governments of the world have mostly agreed on by this point. And that basis does not enable theft because some society wishes to display the grandeur of its state, has newly minted fantasies about its origins and history, or even wants a collection of historical artifacts from all great civilizations for good ends like study or education. Said artifacts almost always serve a better purpose in or near their original setting.

Fun facts about how we celebrate independence. Obviously usually there are many events that are now cancelled because of Corona, but aside from the business as usual as in partying with your  friends/family


1.	Drink some glögg, eat some pastries (puffy plum tarts, gingerbread cookies)
2.	It’s traditional to visit (war) graves. For example students do a torch cavalcade in various university towns. 
3.	Watch Unkown Soldier on tv
4.	Watch people celebrate on the Presidential Independence Day Reception. Yes, you celebrate by looking at how others celebrate on the TV with your friends and family. And judge away all the people attending the Castle Ball.
5.	Go to brunches, eat good food
6.	Put two candles on your window at 6 o´clock. It’s a tradition that traces back to the 19th century, apparently it become a symbol against Russian oppression and legend says it was used as a signal to young me traveling secretly to Sweden and Germany to become jägers that the house is ready to host them and hide them from the Russians.

Independence day is usually a lot more tranquil than i.e hockey celebrations.  It’s not a giant crazy party, but more focused on wars and hardships, remembering those who were here before you.

Open it up for EU stuff and you probably have a constant stream of complaints about Soros or whatever.

There is indeed an issue with some stuff being shut down through cancel culture. Although that is not really the government, but just corporations making the decision. They are very afraid to be associated with even the slightest thing that might upset a few people, exactly because there is so much bullshit on social media.

Honestly, the fix for this all is probably to shut down Twitter and return Facebook to just a platform for friends instead of having pages with millions of followers.

2458,"well, its a bit more complicated than that komşu.

Ataturk wanted to educate this country for democracy. Built special institutes on villages where they raise teachers for those villages everywhere. 

Destroyed feodal power owners as much as possible so that could work,

Wrote a book "" Vatandaş için temel bilgiler "" made people write books for educating people etc.

Ataturk started to share power when He was still alive, sometimes he supported İnönü(more statist guy) when he sees its necassary, sometimes Celal Bayar (more liberal guy)

His dream was seeing turkey as multi-party democracy.

Republic was pretty much statist because people were so poor, liberal economic model wouldn't work. But He was not happy that there was no balance.

He told his liberal friends to build a second party which will defend liberal economics. But then this party became a castle of "" sharia supporter counter revolutioners ""

So it was obvious. Education level of Turkey for democracy was not ready yet.

İnönü supposed to carry on after Ataturk dies.

He was a good soldier(İnönü) but shitty politician. When WW2 break out, İnönü had to think about much more important stuff rather than increasing the democracy level/education of Turkey.

He was not really politically smart guy anyway he just trying to do what he has learned from his teacher.

He had to act like a dictator during WW2, for obvious reasons.

After WW2, he couldn't control his party anymore, new party arised and counter-revolution began.

Maybe, if there was not WW2 at all, İnönü could keep educating the country.

Ataturk was popular. You are wrong about that. Rather than sharia supporters or old feodals and the ones those people lied and controll, everybody loved Ataturk.

İnönü was unpopular.

During ww2 he made some tough rules in case of Turkey would have to join war. Economy gone bad, education gone bad. etc.

Turkey didn'T join ww2 but deeply affected by it.

Ataturk maybe could manage those hard times. İnönü couldn't.

Thats why he lost power to Menderes. And Menderes was a proto-Erdogan guy.

Since Ataturk's revolution was not finished and a guy like Menderes got the power,

Kemalists were afraid they could lose democracy, they could lose everything Ataturk has built. Menderes could try becoming Sultan,

So they stoppsed him. But that was so early and very critical mistake. People hated kemalists for doing that and still today people hate them for that.

It is true, Army intereventions of our politic history slower our process of "" evolving as society on democracy "". But some also claim that Army intereventions also saved it.

Imagine a guy like Erdogan, during 1950's.

No internet. Only the media is the one Governent has. Time like that. If you were kemalist, wouldn't you afraid of him and erase hm before he erases you?

2641,"[Protectionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism) refers to protecting domestic industry from foreign competition.

It's generally considered undesirable to engage in protectionism, because a competitive market is an important part of what makes markets economically-efficient.

There are cases where it can make sense to prevent foreign competition, but this is typically where there is some sort of significant positive externality to having the industry be domestic, which isn't normally the case.  An example might be manufacturing military hardware, say — like, you might place intrinsic value on ensuring that you can build up for war regardless of what is happening outside your borders.

In the common case, both countries involved wind up better off overall if consumers in each country just pick whatever is the most-desirable product, regardless of whether it's from a foreign or domestic source.

That being said, I don't think that the fish dispute is really one of protectionism — it's arguing over ownership of a resource.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/k7doy0/eu_splits_into_two_camps_over_brexit_deal_the/gesh3a3/,duisThias,1607237947

https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/fie/article/html/ecb.fieart202003_01~690a86d168.en.html#toc9 - banks have announced to regulators that they intend to shift €1.2tn to European branches which will be traded on European markets, even if controlled by British entities. Profit on those trades and taxes will be paid in the EU, they’ll give liquidity on European markets, attract investment on European markets, etc, etc.

The thousand firms opening offices is happening in both directions. It’s not a good thing. We had one market, we now will have two. Firms will have to operate to two sets of regulations and pay two sets of overheads etc etc. It’s a huge increase in red tape, hurts trade, and ultimately makes firms on both sides less competitive in the world. This isn’t a zero sum game.

As to the “bigger, stronger EU” you and the commenter agree - read what he wrote. Though the EU isn’t a military entity, we (almost) all work through NATO.

Ultimately, it’s all slightly irrelevant speculation at this stage. We’re locked into this now. Let’s wait for the stats to come out after everyone starts trading on this shadow of a deal.

There are many Finnish towns and cities on the water, but I think that Jyväskylä is the most beautiful of them all - in fact, it's my favorite skyline in Europe.  Some Finns have told me that they consider the city to be ugly and too modern, but for me, its modernity set against the dense forests is a refreshing change of pace from the many historical cities in Europe we admire here.

2758,"Which foreign minister said that. I remember a high ranked politician said that ""50k people died in Dersim..."" in 2010s. But he said these things because these years were ""opening progress"" years. Turkish goverment tried to make a deal with PKK in these years. Because of that some politician said things like that. Anyway, this high ranked politician said ""50k people died"" but the sources that he used were definitely unvalid. These sources were a book of Necip Fazıl Kısakürek, one gendarme report and some diary sections. First, book of Necip Fazıl (I don't remember book's name, sorry) was 100% unreliable Necip Fazıl was an enemy of republic and he was a semi-Islamist Ottomanist. All the things that he mentioned in his book were unsourced and none of historians take this book seriously too. The gendarme report was unapproved too. And this gendarme report unapproved too. There is thousands of approved military raports of Dersim but as I said this gendarme raport was unapproved (and probably fake). And the diary sections... There were nothing can prove that these diary sections. 

Dersim is a event that three big politicial side of Turkey are using against Kemalists. PKK sympathizers and communists, Islamists and far rightists. There is a lot of fake and unapproved sources around here. But Dersim Operation wasn't a black op. Every military moves happend in Dersim are documented. Every soldier are documented too. Let me explain you how military works. Everything are documented in military. From big operations to what a soldier ate in the morning... For example if you assign your soldier to observe an area. Soldier must tell everything that about what happend, what road he used to go to the mission, if he fought with someone how much ammo he used etc. You cannot forgive documents in the military. All the military reports I told you about were written during the operation. You can hide reports to hide an operation, but you cannot change them. And during an operation, for political reasons, you cannot send wrong and incorrect documents to soldiers and commanders. And as I said, Dersim was a clear operation, you can look at first-hand documents in internet.

And the things that I said previous comment are still valid. There were no chemical weapon in Turkish inventory and a technician that knows how to use these weapons before 1939. Foreign sources are supporting these too. There is no sales celtificates about chemical weapons too. Anyway as you understand Dersim is just a political instrument that politicians using for their benefits. I really want you to send who is this foreign minister that you mentioned and what are his sources.",,/r/europe/comments/k765er/today_is_the_86th_anniversary_of_mustafa_kemal/gesbo7n/,PilotSakirBey,1607234128

https://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/aquaculture_en

&gt;In Europe, aquaculture accounts for about 20% of fish production and directly employs some 70,000 people. The sector is mainly composed of SMEs or micro-enterprises in coastal and rural areas. EU aquaculture is renowned for its high quality, sustainability and consumer protection standards.
&gt;
&gt;EU overall output has been more or less constant in volume since 2000 whereas global production, at the same time, has been growing by nearly 7% per year.

https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/120/aquaculture-production-in-the-european-union

&gt;The main aquaculture producers among the EU Member States in 2017 were Spain (21%), France (15%), the United Kingdom (14%), Italy (14%) and Greece (10%), which together accounted for around 74% of total aquaculture production. However, in terms of the value of production, the UK was the leading producer (21%), followed by France (16%), Spain (13%), Greece (12%) and Italy (11%). Bivalve molluscs (mussels, oysters and clams) are dominant in Spain, France and Italy.

2791,"It didn't die, in fact it's the youngest letter (ex aequo with &lt;й&gt;) of the Russian alphabet (even if considered by some as optional and omittable). 

Long story short, Russian before the communist spelling reform had two letters, &lt;е&gt; and &lt;ѣ&gt;, both pronounces as /je/. However, in certain words when the stress moves onto that vowel, it becomes pronounced /jo/ and the spelling used to not indicate it at all. The letter &lt;ё&gt; was sometimes used instead of &lt;е&gt; to indicate the /jo/ pronunciation (words with /jo/ written as &lt;ѣ&gt; were much rarer), but it was not official, and there were other alternatives, like &lt;іо&gt;. The communist reform of 1917 removed the letter &lt;ѣ&gt; (as its only purpose was to make kids fail spelling tests). Later, in 1942, the communists introduced &lt;ё&gt; as an official letter of the alphabet (and &lt;й&gt;, which used to be considered as a mere variant of &lt;и&gt; before that). However, it's use was obligatory only for a short period, since many old fonts did not contain the letter &lt;ё&gt; and the Russian language was fine without it for centuries, so soon after that its use became optional and now you can use &lt;е&gt; if you want.

Probably the most common words with &lt;ё&gt; are &lt;её&gt;, &lt;всё&gt;, &lt;моё&gt;, &lt;своё&gt; and &lt;лёгкий&gt;. If you see &lt;ее&gt;, &lt;мое&gt;, &lt;свое&gt;, &lt;легкий&gt; (but not &lt;все&gt;, as it's a word on its own) in text, then it means that the author or the editor does not like the letter &lt;ё&gt;.

Canada, whose deal you claim to want to replicate, didn't get quota and tariff free trade in goods, mutual recognition of qualifications, no quota for british road haulers, passporting rights for the City of London, etc. On the other hand, the british negotiators put forward such demands. If you want such an extensive deal, you gotta give back a lot more than what Canada or any other third country got.

2975,"I visited Canada once, from Vancouver to Montreal.

On the recommendation of a friend I flew rather than drove the part between Calgary and Montreal.

Judging by the endless, monotonous farming fields I saw on the way, taking a flight over that part is money very well spent.

Pretty much any way you cross it (maybe except in Siberia) there is a LOT of different stuff when travelling the same distance in Europe - looking at Google maps that same distance will take you from Lisbon to Kiev over about 10 different countries populated by people speaking languages from maybe 3 or 4 different language BRANCHES (latin, germanic, slavic and so on).

I suspect population density is exactly the reason that explains the price of flights between cities in Canada vs the ones in Europe.

On the other hand I loved Canada, especially because I like the great outdoors. I mean, one can walk 1/2h to the north from Vancouver (over Grouse Mountain and onwards) and start seeing bear scats. Meanwhile in Europe bears and even wolves are extinct or near extinct in most places and certainly here in Portugal I don't think it's at all possible to walk into one of the local natural parks and get lost in it: one just ends walking out from the other side within 2 days, at most.

From what I have read I think ""rushed"" is a bit misleading, as a lot of the time saved has been from cutting out admin/negotiations/fund raising, and running things in parallel rather than sequentially.

The trials have also been bigger than usual, so we can end up with more patient-months of safety data than with the standard, slow process - side effects pretty much always appear quickly, so if there were any we should still have seen them by now.

Those articles seem to say that the vaccine companies are making governments agree to take on liability for any damages if they want access to their vaccines, not that the companies would be immune all prosecution if they were found to have done something wrong themselves (damages could happen without any wrongdoing). Whilst that isn't ideal, I don't think it is an unreasonable ask - as otherwise the risk/reward calculations would probably see all private companies withdraw from developing any vaccines. There already seem to be similar laws for other vaccines - from the second article:

Then it wasn't illegal, period.

Why deal in such ridiculous theoreticals? The law is what it is today for a reason. Warfare has always been dirty and people still die.

3150,"&gt; If you're ok with using Ukraine as a pawn, it shouldn't be such a big surprise for you when someone could use Germany as a pawn. If you accept such possibility as a principle - then what's your problem with other countries doing it?

Are you delusional? We aren't using you as pawn. In fact we are going to circumvent you so we won't have anything to do with each other. We are not the ones who tell you where to buy your energy from or where you can or can't build your infrastructure. You are free to make business with whoever you want. And if you don't like Russia you can go and buy more expensive gas from someone else. So go ahead and explain where we are using you as pawn.

&gt; Germany set rules (or at least did not object when others set them) - Germany should be ready to accept consequences.

Where did we set rules for you? At least be a bit more specific instead of making unfounded claims.

And why should we object when other countries set rules for you? That's between you and those countries and unlike the US our in case of NS2 also the Ukraine we don't intend to mess with other countries sovereignty. 

&gt; Thats' a big simplification and, ironically, that's basically a German idea. ""Wandel durch Handel"", right?

&gt; I personally can't say that I support this, I'd prefer Ukraine stopped using Russian gas completely. But even if we stop, there's another problem. Due to its geographic location, Russia could cut Ukraine from access to gas from other countries, for example Turkmenistan. Ukraine is also limited in ways of delivery LNG gas, because of Bosphorus limitations.

It's not a simplification it's a fact. For decades Russia sold cheap gas to you and of course that came with Russian influence. You don't like the idea of ""Wandel durch Handel"" and you don't like Russian influence so I'd say it's about time for you to grow a backbone and to stop trading with Russia. Just use the available (and much more expensive) alternatives. We on the other side are fine with the Russian influence over our gas supply and we get cheaper gas in return.
If the Bosphorus is too limited for your LNG needs build more LNG terminals in Poland and the required pipelines to transport that gas to your country. Let's see if the US (that is so concerned with your security and independence) is willing to sell it to you at the same price as the Russians sold their gas. 

&gt; Geographic position of Ukraine is much worse for Ukraine than it is for Germany. Ukraine also has much more limited resources than Germany.

&gt; That's why Americans are right, they want to balance the pressure, Germany could withstand a lot more.

So we have to waste our ressources on your country while you do nothing for us in return? Your geographic position is not our fault so why should we pay for you? Go to the US or your many Eastern European allies instead. I am sure they'd love to share the pressure with you unless they are a bunch of hypocrites who expect Germany to pay in their stead.

&gt; I just enjoy this show, I like how small possibility of losing a penny (and for Germany this pipeline is really a no issue considering the scale) sometimes can create a shitstorm like this. That tells us a lot about all the players that are involved.
&gt; 
&gt; It's almost like a Game of Thrones in real life.

It's not just a penny. It's many billions in transit fees and many more billions if we have to cover our rising gas demand with gas from someone else (like LNG from the US). 
But I am not suprised that you consider it a non issue as long as it is someone elses money. Typical leech mentality.",,/r/europe/comments/k6xvfw/nord_stream_2_dead/geqd1n9/,-GrimmWar-,1607200037

Also there is no “basically” the whole process is hidden in a long line of patents. 

So you’re producing proteins - from a non naturally occurring substance. One the worlds environment has never seen before. In all our evolutionary splendor. 

When we take a “normal” vaccine. These are gradually evolved viruses. The purpose of a virus isn’t really to kill its host. It’s to maximize its life span. 

Pertaining to the trials, sure - safe currently... but it’s whole purpose is to block and take up where the real virus would attach. But we’re not guaranteed other proteins don’t also need to attach there. 

The only saving grace is that they claim its non permanent. Which means you would likely need more than one immunization long term.

Yeah, I can imagine some Malaysian or whatever looking at the news, seeing europeans giving themselves priority over a vaccine they helped fund and being shocked at the fact.  

Give me a break, you reap what you sow. Germany sowed more than anyone else for that vaccine and as such it only makes sense to prioritize themselves. As for ""free market"", the free market would be a contract where they're given funding and in return they have to give priority and sell the future vaccines cheaper to the ones giving said funds, in this case Germany.

Going to Russia years ago on a school trip was an amazing example of this. We went to St Petersburg and then Moscow. Both are incredible, in very different ways. St Petersburg is like Rome, except everything is bigger, and there's more of it. Genuinely the most beautiful place I've ever seen. But then Moscow is full of this really interesting brutalist architecture and I love how it looks. There's nowhere on earth that looks quite like it. The Kremlin is amazing to see, and Red Square. And seeing Lenin's body was weird as fuck after having learnt all the history of him.
  
But yeah they're all beautiful in different ways, all these different European cities. We're not lacking for cities with that older style of architecture, whatever it's called, I'm no expert. But there's also really cool places with all sorts of modern and post modern styles of architecture that are just as breathtaking. Like Barcelona.
  
Or there's places like Galway in Ireland that's a combination of old and new. It's the most multicoloured city on earth. It's incredible. It looks like something out of Harry Potter. All these old style buildings, but then they're all painted in bright colours and it all just looks like an artists pallete. It's absolutely beautiful. Everyone should go to Galway if they can.

3419,"&gt;Full English Breakfast- Add potato scones and haggis, it's now a Scottish breakfast!

The full breakfast isn't a cultural export that Scotland or Ireland adopted with their own twist. A ""full breakfast"" has been a shared hospitality tradition amongst our cultures for 100s of years. A Scottish person travelling to England could equally say the same, ""oh they're just removing the haggis and scones, and calling it an English breakfast instead""

&gt; GBP - Change the design and add famous Scottish faces to it, it's now Scottish pounds!

Retail banks in England also used to be able to print their own notes like, but they lost their right, while it remained in Scotland and Ireland. It's pretty confusing when you come across a Danske Bank one :)

&gt; English language - Add written Scottish dialect to the language, and it's now a Scottish language!

Well there was a  language continuum of old English speakers from the South of England all the way into the low-lands of Scotland. Unfortunately, the English speakers within England got conquered by the Normans and so that language became a kind of creole between old English and Norman French giving us the modern English we know now. But Scots is no more a dialect of English than English is a dialect of Scots. Most linguists don't seem to have any problem recognising it as a Germanic language on the same branch as English and Frisian.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/k6jt5o/top_minority_languages_of_europe_3686_x_2174/gep7oc7/,brother_number1,1607178080

3730,"Britain has accused France of pushing Brexit talks to the brink of collapse by demanding last-minute concessions as the price of a deal.

Discussions between the two sides were suspended last night after Michel Barnier, the European Union’s chief negotiator, ambushed Britain at the insistence of President Macron.

The EU is demanding that the government allow European fishing fleets access to UK waters for up to a decade after the transition period. It also wants to be able to subsidise industries across the bloc without being bound by the same strict rules as the British. With less than four weeks left before the end of the transition period, Boris Johnson will hold emergency talks today with Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission. A senior government official said that the prime minister would make clear that the proposal was “not something that we can agree to or sell”.

Mr Johnson’s spokesman said: “Time is in very short supply and we are at a very difficult point in the talks. What is certain is we will not be able to agree a deal that doesn’t respect our fundamental principles on sovereignty, fishing and control.”

In a statement Mr Barnier and Lord Frost, Britain’s chief negotiator, said that after a week of discussions “conditions for an agreement are not met”. They cited “significant divergences” on the so-called level playing field, governance and fisheries. Figures in London and Brussels blamed the hard line on President Macron after the French leader’s Europe minister warned that France would veto a deal if it did not respect its interests. Clément Beaune told the radio station Europe 1: “If there is a deal that isn’t good, which in our evaluation doesn’t correspond to those interests, we will oppose it.”

A senior European source said: “This is Macron playing De Gaulle. It is very domestic in focus but has all the diplomatic subtlety of a bull in a china shop. It could smash it all up.”

Mr Barnier is travelling back to Brussels today. Tomorrow he will discuss the deal with European ambassadors.

It is understood that the fresh demands were unexpectedly tabled at a meeting with Lord Frost on Thursday.

Mr Barnier said the EU wanted powers to impose punitive tariffs on British exports if Britain diverged from EU environmental and labour laws. He is also understood to have demanded an opt-out for the European Commission on state aid rules, which would allow Brussels to support industries across the bloc as part of its Covid recovery plan. This could put Britain at a disadvantage to France, Spain or Italy, countries that are expected to benefit from the lion’s share of the EU fund.

One British official said the new demands were “completely unrealistic”.

In the parlance of diplomatic language the reference in Michel Barnier’s and Lord Frost’s statement last night to “significant divergences” can be translated as a serious row (Oliver Wright writes). There was no disguising No 10’s anger at the three new demands tabled by the EU.

The first was a variation on a theme — that the UK must be compelled to abide by EU environmental or social rules.

The second is new: that the European Commission is exempt from state aid provisions. This would let the bloc channel money into EU industries, for example for coronavirus recovery plans, while the UK could not.

Finally, on the old sticking point of fishing, the EU will now give up only 18 per cent of their quotas. New arrangements will come into effect after a decade.

The one thing that London and Brussels can agree on is that the new demands were imposed at the insistence of France, with the support of Spain and Italy.

The fact remains that all sides want an agreement. The trouble is that with so little time left, the dangers of miscalculation are higher and the risk of an “accidental” no deal is greater.",,/r/europe/comments/k73z4l/france_derails_brexit_talks_with_lastminute/geome3t/,Useful_Ad9254,1607156934

3738,"The scandal surrounding an illegal Brussels sex party that ruined the career of a senior Hungarian MEP has deepened amid claims that its host is a serial fraudster on the run from the authorities in Poland.

The all-male orgy last Friday night, which was broken up by Belgian police, involved not only a prominent ally of Hungary’s staunchly conservative prime minister but also unidentified diplomats from France and Estonia.

Yet the spotlight has now fallen on the party’s organiser, who is alleged to have spent more than a decade evading a prison sentence in his home country.

In a series of interviews the man has cast himself as David Manzheley, a 29-year-old PhD student who has previously arranged gay orgies for guests including senior figures from Poland’s socially conservative ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS).

Mr Manzheley said four PiS politicians who held “important” government positions had attended orgies two or three times a year. He said nine politicians from Fidesz, the ruling party in Hungary, were among the participants.

“We get politicians from Ukraine, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Spain,” Mr Manzheley told Onet, an independent Polish news website. “But Poles and Hungarians are the most frequent guests. They say that, in order to keep their positions, they have to pretend to agree with their leaders. That is why they come abroad for their fun. If this were to come out into the open in their countries, it would end their careers.”

Opportunities for sexual adventure are seen by many as one of the perks of working within EU institutions: life in the expat “bubble” of Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg offers a freedom to indulge in amorous exploits with less hindrance than at home.

This especially applies to the parliament, with its MEPs shuttling in from various countries and joining the monthly travelling circus from the assembly’s working home in Brussels for a short week’s business in Strasbourg, its official seat.

In the days when French, not English, was the dominant EU language, the parliament was jocularly known as “le baisodrome”, which roughly translates as “shagodrome” — or, as one French dictionary puts it, “a place reserved for lovemaking”.

With its MEPs and multinational army of mainly young staff, EU translators, diplomats, journalists and lobbyists all far from their home base, life in the parliament can be an enticement to dalliance. The Strasbourg run, boasting expense accounts, plush hotel rooms and fine restaurants, was a particular attraction. Boarding the monthly shuttle flight to Strasbourg, some regulars used to recite the Washington joke about marital vows being suspended on trips: “Wheels up, rings off”.

For a hard core, gay and straight alike, there has always been a semi-underground sex scene involving free-for-all parties in flats and houses of the type allegedly arranged by Mr Manzheley and attended by the Hungarian MEP. Another popular venue in past decades was the array of clubs libertins, or commercial sex clubs, that operate in the Brussels and Strasbourg areas.

Polish media have spoken to purported relatives and acquaintances of Mr Manzheley, who say he is, in fact, a 36-year-old fugitive from Wadowice, a town in the south of the country. The reports allege that he is a secondary-school dropout who in 2008 was sentenced to 14 months in jail for posing as a lawyer to extort fees of 2,500 zloty (£500) from disgruntled patients seeking compensation from their hospitals.

The local police told The Times that he left Poland without serving his prison term and has been pursued through a European arrest warrant since 2013. “After he did not report to serve his sentence, the search began. We are still looking for him,” said Dariusz Stelmaszuk, press officer at the Wadowice police station. He noted that Belgian police have confirmed that the wanted man was indeed in Belgium days ago.

Whether this individual and Mr Manzheley are the same person — and whether there is any substance to his uncorroborated claims about the orgies — remains unclear. Mr Manzheley has denied that he is the Polish fraudster. He insists he has never heard of Wadowice and has visited Poland only twice, in 2011 and 2013.

In an interview with a Hungarian news website Mr Manzheley cast the chase as a ploy to discredit him because he claims that one of his regular guests is a high-ranking official from Poland’s justice ministry.

To date the most prominent victim of last week’s police action has been Jozsef Szajer, one of the founding members of Fidesz, who led its group in the European parliament and recently drafted a new clause in the Hungarian constitution that would effectively prohibit gay couples from adoption.

Mr Szajer, 59, who is married to a judge in Hungary’s highest court, was arrested after he attempted to flee the scene by shimmying down a drainpipe. Police allegedly found an Ecstasy pill in his backpack but he denied that it was his. He has since resigned as an MEP and withdrawn from Fidesz.",,/r/europe/comments/k73zju/brussels_gaysex_party_host_david_manzheley_a/geomgv1/,Useful_Ad9254,1607157016

The biggest difference is real estate but even there it's misleading because the majority of 'cheap' houses are very poor quality, so you have to pay more for a well located, well built property. Cars are about 5k cheaper than Germany so that's cool.

Veto is the only guarrantee every member state of EU has to maintain its national sovereignty in this shithole.

If everytime a member state vetoes an EU resolution, and EU knows that it can bypass it through blackmail, then essentially there is no sovereignty anymore.

I'm not saying France's laws are wrong. I don't have a strong support for it or against it because even European countries think different amongst themselves so there is no certain answer.

Oh also, I never condemned the drawings. I find a lot of Hebdo's drawings funny. The 'free-speech' part is up to the gov't to decide. I only said that promoting these pictures after terrorist attacks seems like a way to justify xenophobia. If gov't funds are used to project these pictures to remember Patty rather than pictures of Patty himself, then there is a problem. To make a strong message about terrorism you condemn it many times, you make sure it is never accepted, not project cartoons over people's head to see who'll get offended. Let's say person A is a devout Christian, they would probably find Hebdo's cartoons offensive and wouldn't read it but respect free-speech laws of France. But they don't want these cartoons some find offensive to be projected over their heads with their tax-payer money as an 'anti-terrorism' slogan. They would want to go focus on the teacher who died and condemn the horrible terrorists. Not look at what a disrespectful picture of someone they preach. They already know this shit is going on and avoid it for a reason.

&gt;Norway’s deputy central bank governor with responsibility for the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund has been forced to resign due to security concerns over his Chinese wife.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Jon Nicolaisen, who has had special responsibility for Norway’s $1.2tn oil fund at the central bank for the past eight months but has been deputy governor since 2014, resigned on Friday as he was declined a renewed security clearance.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“The Norwegian Civil Security Clearance Authority informs me that the reason that I will not receive a renewed security clearance is that my wife is a Chinese citizen and resides in China, where I support her financially,” Mr Nicolaisen said.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr Nicolaisen married his wife in 2010. Norges Bank said security clearance was conducted and given by the finance department in 2014. The National Civil Security Clearance Authority was only set up in 2018, and Mr Nicolaisen’s latest clearance process was started late in 2019. .  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The resignation is significant because Mr Nicolaisen only just took over supervision of the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, which on average owns 1.5 per cent of every listed company in the world. His first months in charge were dominated by a heated political debate over the decision of Norges Bank to hire ex-hedge fund manager Nicolai Tangen as chief executive of the manager of the oil fund.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Relationships between Norway and China have also been tense since Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010. Commercial and diplomatic ties were cut, and the current centre-right government in Oslo worked hard to restore links to China, culminating in a deal in late 2016.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The oil fund invested in China throughout the freeze, and currently owns about $43bn in Chinese equities, according to its latest figures at the end of June.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr Nicolaisen said that Norwegian authorities “have determined that there are no circumstances regarding me personally that give rise to doubt about my suitability for obtaining a security clearance, but that this does not carry sufficient weight”.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;His resignation was accepted by Norway’s finance ministry, which will now search for a new deputy governor.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Some experts on the oil fund had grumbled privately in April that Mr Nicolaisen had no asset management experience and thus was ill-suited to overseeing such a large investor.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The job of deputy governor with special responsibility for the oil fund was only created in 2015. Egil Matsen, the first to have the job title, unexpectedly resigned after only four years of his six-year tenure last December.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Governor Oystein Olsen said he would miss Mr Nicolaisen, and added: “He performed his duties superbly as a close colleague and competent professional. In his key positions at the bank, he has over the years made an essential contribution to the development of Norges Bank”.

You need to take history classes stop just reading from one source. Learn the principles of core territory, colony state etc before you call it ""rightfully your land"".

Well I also would like to be in coop mode with greece. Not just greece maybe entire balkans. But it won't going to happen thanks to those nationalism and CIA backed religious stuff happened there. Sad to see.

About Islands, we need to take a different route for that. I am from mobile right now its hard to maintain to discuss things for it. Maybe some other time. Or dm me later.

Turkey uses law and you call it unfair, if she does not use any law, you will call it unfair anyway. What are you looking for is selfish reasons to undermine a country to your own interest. And it seems so far you can't and you are ranting about it.

Let me tell you what is happening in Turkey.

Refugee problem. Medit problem. Economic crisis and covid. 

Replace erdo, someone who is like 100 stats on everything, the dude also has to push for 3 fronts. We do not like to see our boys getting massacred for their country. Nobody does. But shit happens and all you can wish for is the most possible low losses. Take all the refugees from us, prevent the terrorist acts on our borders. Problem solved. Easy to say.

Again replace erdo. The next guy which is probably going to be the next election, if he dares to give up from our seas, our rights or name it whatever a best interest for their country, not just going to lose his presidency even it will be end of his life in turkey. The next generation would deport his sorry ass faster than you may ever seen in this century. The next generation fed so much political sphere and none of them giving any bits to the suckers. Thanks to the erdos islamisation policies. Most of them ended up atheist,deist,agnostic whatever you name of it. Erdo nailed this lol.

Obviously my problem is with people. I do not take it as a x nations people or not. You elected the president and you going to suffer just like we do on turkey.

Adding good EV infrastructure and increasing spend on public transport are the best ways for governments to reduce fossil fuel burning.  Removing parking spaces at a seemingly arbitrary rate is going to cause more problems than it solves:


-Where are the existing cars going to go?
-How do you decide which spaces are removed?*


*This question alone will be a €500,000 question at absolute minimum.  Understanding existing parking use relies on expensive GIS modelling and satellite imagery.  Overlaying this with population density, vulnerable population density, destination parking, workplaces, schools, socioeconomic data, existing public transport data, existing pavement widths and underground infrastructure (pipes, cables etc, presuming the land is being repurposed), road traffic speeds (averages and limits), and whatever else you can possibly think of will take months (with a highly competent team, years with an average one) to do.  Then using this data to build a suitable policy to implement will take even longer, including inevitable public consultation and potential legal cases.

And I agree but yet disagree with the one nation two states slogan. While it’s a warm sentiment and definitely provides a sense of brotherly love its used to prep the populations for the big brother little brother complex. ( Az ask Turks for help Turks come in and help) 

Which is not a bad thing for turkey which seeks to replace Russia’s influence over az not and have more control over the oil which counteracts the IZ and Russian interests( always follow the pipelines) but Az government isn’t fully in favor in letting turkey control them hence why they let in the Russian “peacekeepers” in Az territory in Which in a way backstabbed turkey but it limits both turkish and Russian control and was a smart move for the short term but not long term. In regards to Israel they just care about oil, testing weapons, and bases close to Iran which is strongly in US favor.

I don't have a current study about Finnish being more spoken than Arabic, the last study I saw had such. That's also why I would appreciate a link to another one.

4413,"I’m not convinced that they “don’t know any better” is a sufficient reason. Personally, if I’m visiting a country I try to respect their cultural customs.  I should probably also note that I’m aware of French tipping culture, or lack there of, since I am French myself and lived in Paris for two years after my degree. 

I’m aware that not every country has the same tipping culture, and while in countries like the US workers are often dependent on tips that’s not usually the case in the UK. If you sit down for a nice meal out, you’re expected to tip, and the restaurant I worked in actually had a service charge. That tip goes to the chefs and bartenders too, so it’s important that people follow the social expectations of the country their visiting. Frankly, it is rude when someone refuses to tip, and since people from many other countries managed to do so it’s not really a good reason. 

It was a running joke that French customers were the worst customers for not tipping, whereas other international visitors didn’t have this problem. Being unaware of a cultural expectation isn’t a reason not to do it, nor does it excuse any rudeness. If someone is unsure of a tipping culture, frankly they should just google it!",,/r/europe/comments/k6hfx8/nationality_of_the_largest_group_of_tourists_by/gemb4cz/,madspeepetrichor,1607105931

Nuclear power has a role to play in the fight against global warming and will remain a useful source of energy if the sector continues to innovate, the director of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said Tuesday. ""The challenge before us is so enormous: we must rapidly decarbonize our energy system and this must be done within the next 10 to 20 years,"" said Fatih Birol, the IEA's Executive Director.

""That is why it is extremely important that we use all available clean technologies,"" he said during a speech at the ""Electric Days"", an event organized by EDF, a major producer of nuclear electricity in particular. ""We have solar, wind, hydro, nuclear and energy efficiency. And today nuclear power is the second source of clean electricity worldwide,"" he said.

Nuclear power has the advantage of emitting very little CO2. However, his critics point out the challenges posed by waste management, the risks of accidents or the high costs associated with this industry. Nuclear power ""produces clean electricity without interruption"" and can thus help ""support"" solar and wind energy, argued Fatih Birol.

The head of the IEA, which advises developed countries on their energy policy, also stressed the importance of innovation to develop new forms of energy that respect the environment. ""So I believe that nuclear power has a role today, and if the nuclear industry continues to innovate with new technologies it will clearly have a role in the future,"" he concluded.

4624,"&gt; President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has complained about an international conspiracy forming against Turkey, and he says it’s attempting to frustrate his projection of Turkish power and influence abroad. Domestic and foreign critics counter that there isn’t yet a conspiracy, but if one does emerge, it largely will be due to his picking fights with his country’s neighbors, including the European Union and Turkey's NATO allies. (...)

&gt; Erdogan has in recent months frequently blamed invisible, malevolent foreign enemies for Turkey’s sharply deteriorating economy. For most of this year, foreign investors have shunned the country, and an already weak Turkish lira plunged last month to record lows in value against the dollar and euro. Western critics say Turkish economic woes are the result of his own mishandling of the economy. (...)

&gt; Conspiracy theories have long been a feature of cultural and political life in Turkey, certainly since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. And during his 17-year-long rule, political critics have accused Erdogan of stoking the long-held Turkish fear of being surrounded by foreign powers and beset by shadowy outside forces eager to weaken the country and to prevent it from restoring Ottoman greatness. (...) Erdogan’s frequent complaint about an anti-Turkish foreign conspiracy risks turning into a self-fulfilling prophecy, warn some analysts and Western diplomats. (...)

&gt; Ankara seems ever more willing to challenge allies and enemies alike in pursuit of a larger role on the world stage. If Western nations, and Turkey’s near neighbors, start coordinating containment strategies, it will be as a consequence of Erdogan’s aggressive aim to expand, through assertive diplomacy and military means, Turkish influence in the Mediterranean, Aegean and Black Sea, say Western diplomats and analysts. (...)

&gt; Turkey's wrangling with allies and neighbors have increased since 2015, when Erdogan adopted as policy the so-called Blue Homeland Doctrine, originally drawn up by Turkish Admiral Cem Gurdeniz in 2006. The doctrine outlined an ambitious goal to expand Turkish influence with an aim to improve access to important energy and other economic resources. Its implementation has seen Erdogan resorting to ad hoc arrangements, reversing bilateral understandings, and backsliding on multilateral agreements and Turkish obligations to NATO—creating even greater regional instability, say critics.

4649,"We don't know how these people will be charged, I have been in conversations where people joke around about ""fusilating all bourgeois"" or ""fusilating all communists"", but as long as they are private and have not a plan of execution, they are harmless and natural I'd say. I acknowledge that the police investigates people that tend to joke too much, but as suspects only. On those rare occasions where police find evidence of an actual plan of excecution (like with ETA or more recently with the CDR in Catalonia or DAESH or some neonazi groups) they prosecute, which is natural as their goal is to prevent people being killed. Idk how this case is going to end, but so far we already have a prosecution lead by the defense ministry with the only evidence of a private chat, this is much less than what we are used to see when they prosecute Islamists or other terrorist suspects, they usually don't proseccute before finding weapons or at least material to manufacture explosives.

Talking about killing people in a private conversation is not illegal if there is not a real threat to people's security, killing 26 million people by firearm is just absurd to imagine, not even a war goes to that point most of the times, so how seriously should we take it? Idk, it would be different if they were talking about placing a bomb somewhere, that would be a feasable threat, but this time it doesn't look like a serious threat to me and I think people is just overreacting.

Where? Show me these genocides carried out purposefully by the British. 

&gt;Again, if you think Ulster Scots and Cypriot communities are the same thing, you're rather ignorant or with bad intentions. Lol, we don't even identify with Turkey, unlike Ulster Scots being British still, let alone the literal genetic studies showing that Ulster Scots are Scottish by genes let alone them being settlers, and us being not settlers but literal Cypriots by all means - which wouldn't matter again, given what we do identify as.

And no, we don't identify as Turk Cypriots. We do identify as Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, and our relation is more tricky than you think. And meh.

&gt;How's this so hard to understand? Ottoman Turks settle on the island after retiring from the military, couple of centuries later the Ottoman Emperor gifts Cyprus to us, we leave, island is divided between Turk affiliated Cypriots and Greek Affiliated Cypriots who want union with Greece, Turkey invades and establishes a Statelet Turkish Republic in the north.

Well, actually you can as while Brits were taking over Irish lands and colonising them, Kurds were doing the same for Turkomans and Armenians with the help of the Turkish state.

&gt;Yes, pro-government news agencies are not putting this story in their front page as this story is shamefull for the gov. But is it different anywhere in the world? How is it censoring information? By far the most viewed and accessable TV channel is very much independent and owned by German RTL group. Majority of the online websites are left leaning.

Basically, the denial goes like this

The most realistic theory I've heard is that 'pallas' comes from the proto-Greek for 'young woman' or 'virgin' or something similar related to the goddess, and that all myths were made up later to explain the name.

There was also a succesful assasination of the journalist, Caruana Galizia, who exposed how many of the Panama Papers are linked to Putin and his circle. It is clear that, following Macierewicz's disarmament of the Polish Army, Russia is attempting to destabilize Poland in order to claim influence over the territory. A crucial part of that process is destroying the allyship of EU nations and NATO. 

My point is that Polish folks are being encouraged to distrust their own institutions, how they are doing this is described by Nina Jankowicz.

Gazans are not free to come and go from their own country due to Israeli control. Yet you are telling me that Israel doesn't rule over the Gazans? 

The argument that is always used is ""security."" Hamas has carried out terrorism but Israel ultimately negotiates with them every time there is a ceasefire. Furthermore, even when Hanas has agreed to clamp down on rockets (and held up its part of the bargain) the blockade comyinued.

&gt; And the Palestinian Authority is a separate entity that has its own government, controls its cities, etc. 

They control a small portion of the West Bank and even there their autonomy is limited. A Palestinian can't travel within the West Bank ir leave it without coming under the control of Israel. Neither Gaza nor the Palestinian authority is not a fully sovereign state and Israel absolutely doesn't want them to become one.

5020,"   Polish Ministry of Defence is planning to  acquire some elements of the squadron-level rocket artillery fire module  (Homar system) domestically. The Polish products would complement the  equipment procured within the framework of the FMS programme,  Defence24.pl found out. It is planned that more “fire module” elements  are acquired. It is also possible that new types of rockets would also  be procured.

&amp;#x200B;

The FMS agreement signed in February 2019, covering  the acquisition of the first HIMARS squadron, concerns a modest  configuration when compared to the original plan. 20 launchers with 300  GMLRS and ATACMS effectors and command vehicles with the AFATDS system,  ammunition carriers, and recovery vehicles have been the subject of the  aforesaid purchase.

The agreement signed in 2019 was concluded after a procurement  procedure aimed at acquiring three squadrons from a Polish consortium,  partnering up with a foreign entity was cancelled in 2018. The  procurement above had concerned the system configured to match the  Polish requirements and take into account the Polish-made components  (Topaz artillery fire control system and vehicles) and possible transfer  of technology. Contrary to the initial assumptions, however, fewer  rockets have been acquired. **Three Homar squadrons were to receive 1.8  thousand live rockets (in the case of GMLRS - manufactured in Poland,  mostly).** Reconnaissance vehicles were not procured as well.

Responding to the questions asked by us, the Press Department at the  MoD’s Operational Centre stated: “The elements of the HOMAR  squadron-level fire modules procured within the framework of the FMS  agreement implemented now constitute just a part of the expected  inventory to be assigned to the element. The remaining elements of the  HOMAR squadron-level fire module are being procured on the domestic  market.

As for now, we do not know what elements the Polish Ministry of  Defence would be willing to acquire locally. The above could refer to  the reconnaissance vehicles, as these had been a part of the original  Homar system configuration. It is possible though, that other elements  could be procured as well. Most probably squadron-level joint operations  would be taking place with the use of the AFATDS and the Polish Topaz  system, adopted to work together within the framework of the ASCA  initiative involving Poland.

The MoD confirmed that the Technical Modernization Plan covering the  period until 2035 also envisages the acquisition of more Homar modules.  “As the plan in question is a confidential document, any quantitative  and value-related data cannot be publicly disclosed”, it was stressed.

It remains an open question whether and within what scope the future  squadrons would differ from the first one. It cannot be ruled out that  some elements manufactured locally would be used here. Some could  potentially be acquired based on industrial cooperation, should  initiative as such indeed be launched. 

The MoD also referred to the procurement of live effectors for the  HIMARS/Homar system. “Within the framework of the current agreement, a  base quantity of effectors is envisaged, required to achieve the basic  operational capacity. Further procurement would be planned as  appropriate, concerning the expansion of the element’s combat  capabilities, procurement of subsequent modules and with the  technological advancements taken into account with regard to the system  and the rockets”, the Polish Ministry of Defence announced.

The fact that the “technological advancement” is taken into the  account means that the MoD does consider the acquisition of further  equipment, namely modern armament for the HIMARS/Homar system. The above  possibly could refer to the GMLRS-ER rockets developed in the US, with  the range extended up to 200 kilometers. A single launch container would  still accommodate six rockets. **The new effectors may also include the  LRPF tactical missiles with a range of around 500 kilometers. The LRPF  effectors would only enter service in a few years, gradually replacing  the ATACMS missiles.**

Certainly, the introduction of these missiles, once the development  process is finalized, would constitute a major reinforcement for the  Polish rocket artillery units. Another option would be to introduce  GLSDB missiles developed by Boeing and Saab, fusing the M26 MLRS and SDB  guided bomb units, with a range of up to 150 kilometers. We still have  no idea whether, and to what extent Homar could become a program in  which the Polish industry would play a relevant role.",,/r/europe/comments/k6fkwf/will_poland_purchase_new_elements_for_the/gekk3ve/,TyrantfromPoland,1607063686

5065,"The original  [""Why is \[country name\] ... - Swiss edition""](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/k5spq6/why_is_country_country_name_swiss_edition/) was flawed in 2 ways:

1. An undirected [Google.com](https://Google.com) was used rather than the native [Google.ch](https://Google.ch), likely leading to results from unspecified places.
2. The questions were asked in English. Swiss typically ask their Google questions in German or French, less commonly in Italian. The English questions are likely to be entered by non-Swiss residents.

Thus I present to you this less flawed version using [Google.ch](https://Google.ch), with questions asked in German, and answers translated into English for the map. (If a fellow Swiss from the French-speaking part would join in, that would be quite interesting.)

This is the most pathetic attempt at propaganda I have heard yet. Now I want you to back up your bullshit claims. Particularly about desecration! 

Firstly, It doesn't belong to Greece. The Byzantine's ( NOT MODERN GREECE ) lost is over 500 years ago. It was a Mosque for 400 years and only in the past century was it turned into a Museum. 

As of right now it is STILL a Museum and ALL the mosaics have been preserved! In fact the Ottoman's preserved them from day one and never got rid of them. They simply covered them up with plaster. NOW they have simply installed a draw curtain to cover them during prayer. Between prayers it goes back to being a Museum and the curtains are pulled back! So where is this bullshit desecration you speak of? 

Why is Greece involved in a building it doesn't own? It wasn't even a Greek who ordered its construction. Justinian wasn't Greek. Not to mention that the Byzantine considers themselves Romans and only later switched form Latin to Greek.",,/r/europe/comments/k67z8e/egypt_greece_agree_on_strengthening_joint/gekapqs/,no-bs10,1607056134

5156,"&gt;Firstly, It doesn't belong to Greece. The Byzantine's ( NOT MODERN GREECE ) lost is over 500 years ago. It was a Mosque for 400 years and only in the past century was it turned into a Museum. 

&gt;As of right now it is STILL a Museum and ALL the mosaics have been preserved! In fact the Ottoman's preserved them from day one and never got rid of them. They simply covered them up with plaster. NOW they have simply installed a draw curtain to cover them during prayer. Between prayers it goes back to being a Museum and the curtains are pulled back! So where is this bullshit desecration you speak of? 

I get that this is hard for a muslim to understand because you guys never lost your holy sites and in fact took many Christian ones as well but what would you call it if Christians took Mecca, prevented Muslims from visiting and worshipping it, covered up the black box and allowed Christians to pray there?

&gt;Why is Greece involved in a building it doesn't own? It wasn't even a Greek who ordered its construction. Justinian wasn't Greek. Not to mention that the Byzantine considers themselves Romans and only later switched form Latin to Greek.

I don't care about Greece I'm on about religion. The Hagia Sofia is important in Orthodox Christianity, specifically the Greek branch of it but in general it is of importance to the Orthodox faith.

&gt;Typical early 20th century Greek propaganda. Some of the most vicious propaganda that Europe had seen until WW2. Modern Greece tried to claim entire chunks of land that never belonged to it. It made bullshit connections to Ancient Greece, Ancient Macedonia and Byzantium. 

I mean because they were the same people and many Greeks still lived in places like Smyrna that were claimed after WW1.

&gt;Most modern Greeks cannot even trace their Greek heritage back 3 generations let along Ancient Greece. A huge proportion of modern Greeks are Hellenised Turks and Slavs.

I think you've got it the wrong way around generally it's Turks that have been found genetically to not have much Turkic genes in them, mostly having mixed with the native Anatolian Greeks and other minorities in the area.",,/r/europe/comments/k67z8e/egypt_greece_agree_on_strengthening_joint/gekcreb/,MyNewAccountIsHere,1607057678

*** WW1 that made it all too easy to cover it up. 

Losses in russo-turkish wars and balkan wars saw almost a million turkish refugees settle in turkey and helping deal with the armenians. 

Now read this part carefully:  

&gt;Historians argue that the mass confiscation of Armenian properties was an important factor in forming the economic basis of the Turkish Republic while endowing Turkey's economy with capital. The mass confiscation of properties provided the opportunity for ordinary lower class Turks (i.e. peasantry, soldiers, and laborers) to rise to the ranks of the middle class. Contemporary Turkish historian Uğur Ümit Üngör asserts that ""the elimination of the Armenian population left the state an infrastructure of Armenian property, which was used for the progress of Turkish (settler) communities. In other words: the construction of an étatist Turkish ""national economy"" was unthinkable without the destruction and expropriation of Armenians.

5251,"For four years, president Donald Trump radicalised international relations. There was a shift towards the nation state and unilateralism, beginning with the United States. He viewed intergovernmental organisations like the WHO or the World Trade Organization with acute scepticism thanks to what he saw as their bureaucratic sloth and partisanship. His perception of the European Union and Nato was little better; the first he perceived as an unfair competitor; the second a free-loading bureaucracy. So it came as no surprise that the EU could barely contain its joy at Joe Biden’s election, even if certain eastern member states were reticent. However, the EU will be disappointed if it believes president-elect Biden’s foreign policy will align with its own. In reality, the process will see Biden’s alignment with much of Trump’s policies and the EU following Biden’s.

Personality notwithstanding, Donald Trump achieved a great deal in international affairs. He dared forcefully, often recklessly, to implement what professional politicians and diplomats over many years had recoiled from doing. He opened face-to-face negotiations with North Korea’s leader, took on China’s protectionism and insidious imperialism, unblocked the Middle East log-jam by encouraging Israeli relations with the Gulf States (and even Saudi Arabia), while rattling self-satisfied and sclerotic international organisations. 

Trump’s mission is unfinished. But so much heavy lifting has been completed that the Biden team is bound to build on it. And the EU, forever lacking in strategic autonomy, will have little choice but to follow. They will be seduced by a change in tone and a new-found co-operative and multilateralist rhetoric. But even on issues close to home like burden-sharing in Nato — an old Obama gripe — little of substance will vary from the Trump posture. The first thing the EU will turn to in assessing the direction of travel will be personalities, then policies.

As Biden’s governing team is revealed, it is clear now that the erstwhile divisions between the restorers of Obama’s foreign policies and those in favour of change have melted into a fudge. As with all new administrations, permanent officials in European foreign ministries will be poring over the biographies of senior Biden officials to see what links they have with their capital. 

Many of Trump’s changes will be continued, more slowly and doubtless in semi-camouflaged form, by those who served Obama. The French will be doubly pleased to see the appointment of old Obama hand Antony Blinken as Biden’s secretary of state. He served as deputy national security adviser from 2013 to 2015 and deputy secretary of state from 2015 to January 2017. French eyes will have lit up at Blinken’s attendance of the ultra-elite fee-paying Parisian high school, Jeannine Manuel, attended by the children of Nicolas Sarkozy, Alain Delon and the princely family of Monaco, even if this may not play well to Bernie Sanders’s wing of the Democrats. 

Equally, John Kerry, Obama’s former secretary of state, as special envoy for climate, will warm French hearts for being a cousin of former French Green party minister Brice Lalonde. Or White House deputy principal press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre for being born in French Martinique and raised in Paris. Of course, all chancelleries the world over play this parlour game, only to discover a year or so later Lord Palmerston’s realpolitik wisdom that countries have no eternal allies only eternal interests.

So, in terms of policies, what differences of substance are the Europeans likely to encounter in Biden’s policies? The New York Times — obviously without sarcasm — described Biden’s diplomatic stance as one of ‘strategic empathy’. Changes will be at the ‘soft power’ end of the foreign policy spectrum, notably climate change. America’s rejoining of the Paris climate agreement will be the opportunity for a widely-covered transatlantic reunion. Although Trump’s economic decoupling from China and rivalry will continue, Biden will enrol the Europeans in attempting closer relations with China on issues of climate, health security and non-proliferation. A transatlantic charter may even be concocted to symbolise closer relations on international affairs.

But those European Union member states who have done their homework on Biden’s likely policies — if they think like Emmanuel Macron — will be disappointed by the deep-seated suspicion among Democrat strategists for the idea of ‘European strategic autonomy’. The French president’s recent ‘Macron doctrine’ is inextricably based on that notion, in industrial policy as much as defence. 

However, those in the German camp will be delighted with Biden’s clear attachment to the centrality of Nato in transatlantic security architecture, a joy witnessed in the German defence minister’s recent robust defence of America's European security guarantees against Macron’s call to break free. But the German camp should be prepared for the quid pro quo: less free-riding and a binding commitment by EU member states to meet the two per cent GDP target for financing Nato.

On that other subject close to Europe’s home, Russia, Biden strategists have wavered between closer relations on issues such as arms control and a tougher stance on, for instance, the Trump policy of removing US troops from Germany, which the Biden camp has made clear is ‘a gift to Putin’. Once again, this is likely to divide EU members, notably Macron, who controversially favours Europe working far more closely with Russia.

EU politicians and media acclaim for Biden has been dithyrambic — but be careful what you wish for. Change on the big issues is likely to be small. However, on those Biden policies directly applicable to the EU, the impact is likely to generate further cracks in a house divided already on economics, finance, and the ‘rule of law’.",,/r/europe/comments/k6cyp6/joe_biden_isnt_the_president_the_eu_thinks_he_is/gek5qig/,casualphilosopher1,1607052838

2. force different groups to ""unify"" and assimilate into 1 homogenous group.

Both of these options have huge, huge issues, and it is not an easy thing to fix.

5406,"Located on the westernmost edge of Tuscany, with its harbor opening onto the Ligurian Sea, the Italian city of Livorno - also known as Leghorn - was one of the main trading centers in Europe. Becoming a major port during the rule of the Medici family in the 16th century, Livorno received the status of a free port in 1675 and was an important connecting point between the Mediterranean, North Sea ports and the Near East. For hundreds of years, the Jewish community of Livorno was one of the city's most distinguished and distinctive and though the numbers have dwindled since World War II, there remains a deep Jewish culture within the city.

In the middle of the 16th century, when Livorno was a miserable, malaria-infested village, its rulers, the Medici family, decided to turn it into an important port and attract foreigners to settle. In 1548, Cosimo I issued an invitation to foreigners, including fugitive Marranos, to come to the new port. His project, however, met with little success.

Years later, in 1587, the Grand Duke invited merchants of all nations to come to settle in Livorno and Pisa. A further invitation was issued by Ferdinand I on June 10, 1593, offering asylum to all Levantines, Spanish, Portugese, Germans and Italians. The majority of Ferdinand's invitation articles were directed to the Jews who had lived as Christians in Spain and Portugal. The charter – referred to as ""Livornina"" – guaranteed full religious liberty, amnesty for crimes previously committed, the opportunity for ""Marranos"" to return to Judaism unmolested, a large exemption from taxation, and commercial freedom.

Jews and other nationalities were given many rights and privileges. Ferdinand I’s charter offered the Jews religious freedom, amnesty from previous crimes, full Tuscan citizenship and special courts with civil and criminal jurisdictions. Safe passage of goods and persons was guaranteed to all Jews who moved to Livorno. Jews could own houses, inherit property, carry arms at any hour, open shops in all parts of the city, have Christian servants and nursemaids, study at the university, work as doctors and did not have to wear the Jewish badge. Finally, unlike many other cities in Tuscany, Jews did not have to live in a ghetto.

These conditions proved attractive to Marranos and Levantines and the Jewish population grew from 114, in 1601 to 3,000 by 1689. Jews came to be the most important nation living in Livorno. Spanish and Portugese became the official language of Jewish merchants in Livorno and remained so until the late 18th century.

Livorno served as a center for Jewish study and mysticism led by Rabbi Joseh ben Emanuel Ergas (1685-1732) and other Kabbalists. A special talmudic court opened and the elders of the community (Massari) presided over the cases. Because of the existence of the Talmud Torah school in Livorno, illiteracy among Jewish males was unknown from the 17th century on.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/k5eea6/top_20_eu_short_sea_shipping_ports_million_tonnes/gehjoni/,not-scared,1607005036

5558,"&gt; an utter failure and an idiotic plan. 

It was part of an attempt to encircle the Ruhr industrial area early thus bringing the war to a much shorter conclusion. 

The allies in September of 1944 were very fuel constrained so could only really have something that was that armour light in terms of an operation. 

It was flawed and had serious problems with execution but that is the norm in war. Everything goes to sh\*t the moment the bullets start flying. 

It was a failure, but thats war. It was far less of a failure and far less costly than Bradleys attempt to batter through the Hurtgen Forest a couple of months later. 

In hindsight clearing Walcheren would have been better use of limited resources. 

From a modern soldering perspective they failed to maintain their impetus. (And the missing of two of the very few Nazi armoured divisions left was a huge one). Had it succeeded the war would have been months shorter. Millions of lives would have been saved. 

Flawed, yes.

The meagre recourses should have been better used. Yes.
