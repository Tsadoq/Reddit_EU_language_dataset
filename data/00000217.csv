Saying it like this is a bit misleading. Most of the Balkan migrants to Turkey were ethnic Turks, the ratio and overall population of ethnic Turks in the Balkans was higher in Ottoman times than it is today. 

Of course there were also non-Turkish Muslim Balkan migrants to Turkey too, who felt their identities more tied to Turkey (due to religion) than to their respective ethnic group’s fledging nation-states.

12,"&gt;If you have white skin, you’re white. White isn’t a cultural identifier, it’s a lack of melanin. Poland is overwhelmingly a white country. Just like finland is an overwhelmingly white country. Get over yourself.

I don't have white skin, lol, blacks don't have black skin too. White is just an identity, not a race, and it was created in America who gradually lost it's identitty. Same for ""blacks"".

There are also no universal ""black people"" in Africa, in fact, Africans don't like to be called black, they want to be called by their actual ethnicity.

&gt; Being dominated by men isn’t something people are naturally predisposed to. 

Tell that to women who seem to overwhelmingly have sexual fantasies involving violence and rape.

Also, why is 50 shades of Gray such a popular book? Multiple lady friends I have read it and liked it, yet they seem to be on the ""strong"" side.

And actually, people are predisposed to be dominated by males, both males and females. That how we were basically before even society existed, a small amount of super dominant men were exerting their power over all women and majority of men.

&gt; Poland is weirdly unable to cope with sexuality, maybe it’s the catholic problem or maybe is closeted homosexuality (or maybe both). Either way, it’s a problem, and it’s ridicuolous.

First of all, gays are not routinely killed, hanged or publicly harrased in Poland, the general public is just cold/ignorant about them. The general consensus is ""keep your bedroom in your bedroom"". Whenever some act of violence happens, police is always there to investigate, and they do not ignore it like in Russia.

For tea specifically: never assume the bag of tea you bought
contains pure leaves of the cultivar / region advertised on
the label. The threshold according to regulations is actually
50% – if it contains just above 50 % Darjeeling leaves, it can
be legally sold as Darjeeling. Considering how rare tea from
that region is, it’s the rule for vendors to stretch it as much
as the legal limit allows … Which makes the situation even
worse than with meat where the content must match the label.
With tea, it only constitutes fraud if the content is more than
half contaminated.

Darjeeling’s actually a special case as you can ensure purity
by buying only from vendors with a Tea Board of India
certification or, more recently, the AOP stamp on them.
However, tea shops mostly don’t care cause their customers
don’t either. And that’s just Darjeeling. I’m not aware of anything

The only thing that would have saved Poland from being invaded would have been to be militarily powerful enough to make it too costly to invade.  Based on geography, they were pretty much doomed.  In a case like that nationalism that would have enabled them to build up a better defense would have been better.

As for racism, they were all white people from the same basic region.  What races do you think were involved?  There were different cultural and political groups but again, if you do not care enough about your group to defend it then it is just a matter of time until the more powerful group next door notices.

115,"I don't think Germany has overarching equivalents to these specific ones.

If only look at modern Germany's political history, the eras would probably look like this:

* Prussia + German nationalism (though I have no idea what the southern mess was)
* German empire
* Weimar era
* Nazi era
* Divided Germany &amp; Cold war era
* German reunification

So if you say ""Back in Victorian times, they had [...]"" you can similarly say ""During the Weimar republic [...]"" or ""In the Weimar era [...]"" (the periods don't match but i was going for the translation here) but it is not really mainstream to say that for architecture like you do in the UK since architecture styles didn't necessarily coincide with political era.

One exception is the Nazi era since it is such a unique period that influenced everything. You do hear stuff like ""This is a Nazi era building"" or ""This is an example for the style of the Nazi era"". 

Other than that you just say the specific time period, like ""That building from the 1890s"" or the overall literary/artistic period in Europe ""That art nouveau building there"".

There are regional terms though. In Berlin, you refer to the ""Gründerzeit"" architecture or in general the era during which Berlin rapidly expanded and industrialized as part of Prussia and then the German empire, Gründerzeit literally meaning ""founder's time/period"". I don't think the terms stretches throughout all of Germany (no idea though, other people might correct me).

&gt; 
&gt; An electric motor is simply a motor, it is not an engine. Period.

The problem is that you don't understand how this works, and even after it has been explained several times still bury your head in ignorance. I can't tell if it's simply stupidity or just plain stubborness. Perhaps a bit of both. 

Let me dumb it down a bit for you, say you're about to untie a very tight bolt. You have 2 persons, one weak person and one strong person. The weak person has a long wrenge (torque), the strong person has a short wrenge. Both produce the same amount of power on the bolt and are able to untie the bolt (carry the trailer) as they're both able to produce identical power (HP) on the bolt, even though the weak person has a longer wrenge. The length of the wrenge does not determine if you can undo the bolt, the strength in your arms combined with the length of the wrenge does. The end product being your ability to move x kg in Y seconds over a distance of Z meters and *that* is horsepower.

&gt; An electric motor is simply a motor, it is not an engine. Period.

An electric motor is an engine. It's like calling a hood a bonnet, and a trunk a boot. It's both correct.

199,"It depends on the era and how recent is the even. For example, in the Czech Republic, the modern events are described by specific months, which caused the change from the previous order. Current time is referred as post-November due 1989 Velvet revolution that happened in November. Prior time frame was depicted as post-August to reference to the Soviet Invasion on 8-21-1968. The communist regime also used post January development in 1968 depicting the fall of the president Novotny and the rise of Dubcek, or post-February system with a reference of the communist takeover in 1948.

Deeper in the history, the Czechs do have traumatic events which depict specific break in the history.  For example, the battle of the White Mountain (Bilá Hora in Czech) in 1620 marks the end of the Czech independence and its subsequent incorporation into Austria followed by the brutal subjection of the population that enjoyed prior that defeat almost 150 years of peace and prosperity. Therefore, the Renaissance is often classified as ""předbělohorská"" era, meaning a time prior White mountain \[před means prior\] and counter-reformation and baroque period as ""pobělohorská "" era \[po means after\] White Mountain to depict recatolization effort lasting till to the start of Enlightenment Absolutism (1740). 

A similar description is used to define Bohemian and Czech history prior Hussite Revolution (1419-1434) and after. The issue with such depiction is a blurred boundary at either end, because the process that triggered the Revolution was accumulated hatred toward the order and its subsequent restoration. Some historians depict time před/prior Hussite either as an entire Luxembourg dynasty starting in 1310 but it coincides with the Golden Age in Bohemia, while others put it toward the disorder triggered by the death of the Charles IV (+1378) with a clear delineation of the revolution. The post Hussite time is again similarly blurred at the end, because it could depict the interregnum (1453 when Louis the Posthumus was crowned) or all the way to the death of the George of Podebrady, the Hussite King in 1471. The Hussite epoch was over with the election of the Jagiellon dynasty that brought Renaissance into Bohemia and Moravia. 

Architecture styles were influenced by these events and there was a clear break in culture, art, lifestyle, and literature. For example, late Premyslid dynasty (1196-1306) brought a Gothic architecture, which is described as early Gothic. The Luxembourg dynasty (1310-1419/1437) was a time of the High Gothic which ended with the Hussite Revolution. Post-Hussite Revolution created a new type of Gothic art that is described as a Late Gothic.",,/r/europe/comments/9d9efi/in_your_country_how_do_you_refer_to_different/e5h7sft/,kaik1914,1536207860

""Us backed troops in syria"" aka pkk, a group usa recognizes as a terrorist group but simply renamed it to ypg or sdf. Usa has been fighting a proxy war against turkey since the begining. It wasnt turkey who started it, it was the usa who armed terrorist inside turkey.

Turkey funds islamic extermism??? You really got to give proof. Turkish sunnism has no anti western groups as far i am aware of. Maybe its you who should reflect on what propaganda you have been taking.

Btw i still have a gut feeling that you are some how a kurd or related to. Or it was the propaganda.

Edit: i just saw an other comment by you about the Palestine israel dispute. If you cant even realize that israel does everything possible to withheld palestine from becoming independent and a separate country than maybe its you who has a serious lack of morals and cognitive abilities.

To simplify, let's imagine a binary tree for some universe. The first split is between a 'universe with life' leaf and a 'universe without life' leaf. Following the 'universe with life' leaf, the next split can be something like 'life with higher intelligence' versus 'life without higher intelligence'. Following 'life with higher intelligence', we can create all sorts of conditions resulting in a myriad of diffirent conclusions, of a multitude of different beings. But for every single possible creation, each and every one with higher intelligence can look back and say 'Isn't it too improbable that we exist? It cannot be coincidence.'. Well, yes it can.

Contains both grammatical cases and genders

In that example pretty has different versions depending on the gender of the noun it describes.

Lep - for masculine (i used male there lol) nouns

Lepa for feminine nouns

Lepo for neuter

So itd be:

Lep automobil, lepa fotografija, lepo vino

In genitive

Od (from): lepog automobila, lepe fotografije, lepog vina

Dative

Ka (to): lepom automobilu, lepoj fotografiji, lepom vinu

Accusative:

Vidim (i see): lep automobil, lepu fotografiju, lepo vino

Etc for vocative, instrumental and locative

Basically you have to change the adjectives, nouns, pronouns and adverbs differently depending on both what they represent in the sentance (grammatical case) and you change them in a way depending on their gender of the noun. 

In some languages it has more and in some less sense. 

In serbian masculine nouns *typically* end in consonants or u or i.  Feminine in a. Neuter in e or o. There are exceptions to all of those though. 

Krv is feminine, radio masculine, etc for example

The option to mass-convert, expel or murder the Muslims in Iberia was just a nice side-effect.

And a war in the Levant would of course be just if your pilgrimage was attacked by the Muslims rulers in the region. A good way to procoke such an attack would be to have your pilgrim trail dress like an army, march like an army and receive an order from nobles like an army.

Most Turkish immigrants up until now have been working class, rugged, grafters, a bit more street wise type people etc. who will work hard to emigrate out either legally or illegally. 

Whereas this new demographic is the more liberal, soft, ivory tower type of Turk, who were perhaps afraid of the adventure. Things have now gotten so bad in Turkey that it is now worth jumping on the adventure and surprise, surprise they realise they should have done it years ago! 

I’m happy in a way because it will be nice for this demographic of Turks to get more exposure to the West, and for the West to learn more about this type of Turk, who otherwise can only be seen by going to Turkey itself (and to be specific to the non-touristy parts of Turkey and Turkish social life, where people actually live their lives).

The earliest migration to the UK was turkish cypriots in the 50s and 60s, turks/kurds in the 80s til 2000s (most seem very successful, at least those in London, took over many defunct areas from greeks in north london and revitalised it) and now a new breed of turk as you mentioned whos views are much more aligned with those in the west and much more skilled.

We're they wrong about refugee murders being an issue? Even if they just did it for their own devices and recruitment?

&gt;to fit their own agenda.

Is that not what politics *is*? Finding problems in society, blaming it on others/providing a solution, I find the term confusing, because politics is about *using your agenda to promote your view*

People often criticise various groups for using events to manipulate and promote their own 'political narrative', but it isn't 'promoting a political narrative' if a health service is doing badly, and I use this as a reason to boost staff/improve stands/laws/funding?

I agree that Neo Nazi's were at the protest, and I agree that some of them were deliberately preaching pro-fascism statements, but what helped them was less their message, but the media's response to it, the response to it was to obviously criticise the neo nazi's, as you should, but the media mentioned *little* about the reason itself, *why* the Neo nazis and ordinary folks came out to complain, which helped re-enforce the 'narrative' that the media was all out defending migrants rather than their own people.

Long story short, the massive support the Afd got wasn't because of the Neo Nazi propaganda taking place, but rather how the media reported it, they fell into the trap of focusing on the counter protests, and discussing little on the actual murder itself.

Some people may think ""Well, the Neo-Nazi's said the media does not care for Germans, and all the media is doing is scrutinising them for complaining about it, rather than actually talking about what happened to cause the riots, so yes, they are right!"".

See what happened?

The Neo Nazi's did little of the work to increase support, what the Nazis did was attract attention to themselves by doing nasty things, and the media (obviously) focused on it, potentially helping enforce the ""Germany cares not for Germans"" narrative, the media did that themselves through focusing reporting on the counter-protests, and not talking about why it happened.

Political and media manipulation at its finest.

542,"In 31 years living Germany I have not witnessed anything like you describe it. I come from Mainz, a German city with 100.000 people living there. I belive that 25% of them are immigrants o  immigrants of the second or third generation. You sit in the city bus and you hear German, English, Turkish, Persian, Russian spoken around you. People are white, brown, black, whatever. 

&gt;In many German cities the situation is this:

&gt;People don't send their kids to the public pool anymore, they avoid the city center as much as they can, basketball courts, public parks. All places where they used to enjoy spending time. 

&gt;They seclude themselves, drive hours to expensive swimming parks, sports centers where only members can play basketball, nature parks far away, etc.

Never, EVER, have I met a single person that has acted this way. Not one. Not since 2015, not before.  There are certain parks that I would not sent my kid alone, because they are well known meeting points of drug dealers and the like, sure. Those places exist everywhere, with and without refugees. 

I worked with children and families of the middleclass to upper middle class, which would be the kind of clientel that could afford the behavior you are descrobing. Out of the well over 200 families I have worked with I think one MIGHT have acted according to your description, and guess what kind of political party they felt drawn to... 

In short: I think you are, for what ever reason, painting a picture that has nothing to do with reality, at least not how i perceive it.

544,"Hm. I'll try to find something. For now I have found some clues. From 1953 onwards West Germany was paying compensations to prisoners of concentration camps. Poland wan't part of that deal. Only in 90's and early 2000's Germans distributed around 1,5 billions euro amongst 440 thousand people - former prisoners of forced labourers. Total amount money paid that way was around 70 billions. 1,5 from 70 is around 2,1 %.

Another thing. On 26 May,1952 Germany signed an agreement (Überleitungsvertrag) with USA, GB and France that Germany renounce it's claims on properties of Germans that were confiscated, damaged etc by these allied powers. Germans were obliged to compensate it's citizens for that. Nothing of that sort was agreed with Poland. Not in 1970, not in 1990 nor in 1991. For Poland this is important matter. Germans left Poland on very different grounds, some were running away from incoming Soviets, others were expelled, the last major contingent left in 1970s (Spataussiedler).

&gt;Plus, Germany has invested a ton in Poland through the EU already.

This is only partially true. There were other contributors to EU budget (like Holland, France, UK). Giving all the credit to Germany isn't fair. Also in nominal values Poland got the biggest share, but we should put this into perspective - Poland is more Populous than rest of the countries that join in 2004).

The money wasn't paid to compensate Poland for war but for opening her market. Germany kept some branches of industry closed for Polish companies up into early 2010's.

And i thought that having countryside people being indifferent (which mean being tolerant, they are tolerating homosexuality) to gay was a relative great thing if we compared it to the image of the conservative small village living in another era.  After don't get me wrong, it would be better if they were supportive.

But, I'm really curious about the indifference. As I saw it, being indifferent is not something bad. You can summarize it as ""this person is doing whatever he wants, I don't care"". The same as for example polygamy (or ""menage a trois"", because I don't want us to enter in the debate of patriarchy) and if people don't care it look good, because it implied that this person will not be judge by the other person ? 
Or maybe we dont use the same definition for this words ? (Btw that's why I point that according to me, the definition of tolerance is being indiffernnt)

So it only sounds pro-migration until you know what the alternatives were.

As for the consequences... it has already been the situtation for some time, not so much change then. Some CEE countries like Poland have been holding a twisted speech regarding what the structural funds are or what the EU is and judging by some post from Poles for instance, it is not like they regarded France without hostility and 2004 opening wasn't something popular in France. No need to make things worse but no need to play friends when there were better days... if they were any. It is also French diplomacy's fault to not be more direct when a foreign leader is saying BS. 

Moreover, who told you it is not what they are looking for? Macron has always considered the current EU unworkable with so many members and is pushing for a multispeed Europe. Sidelining some countries is easier if they sideline themselves on their own. They even wilingly signed an agreement making solidarity toward others countries on a voluntary basis. A then Salvini allies with Orban and Hungary complains that mulitspeed Europe is a mistake. Makes sense!

792,"No problem and thank you for yours! I am familiar with the situation in Germany because a good friend is German and actually works for the government in quite a high position. I have had long conversations with him and he was initially set about were I estimate you stand in relation to the government. He since has changed a lot (especially after he bought his wife a small diesel car and the local legislators immediately banned them from certain main streets at her location - even though she is allowed to drive in adjacent roads, as if emissions are restricted not to enter a nearby location because the legislator has issued a law!!).

 I think that it won't be long until I convince him to vote for libertarian solutions (not that they can't be intrinsically as or even more statists - but at least we vote them not to). 

Having said that a good rule of thumb for everyone in order to estimate the incentives behind obscure/dubious political moves (or any such actions for that matter) is to look at the actual outcomes (I believe Karl Jung had said that). 

That's a very useful tool which if you implement at various regulations you'll realise that the greatest percentage of advertised intentions had nothing in common with actual outcomes.  

Take for example your renewable energy subsidisation scheme in Germany. I know that the average household pays about 300€ annually for funding the government's plan to transition to greater percentages of renewable energy sources. No parliamentary opposition whatsoever for this which one would think as ""fine"". At this point I mustbtell you that my source is a German professor from Hamburg university (if I am not mistaken) who I saw in an online interview. 

He claims that CO2 emissions actually have been raising the past years. Why? Because when you subsidise something with - if I recall well - 25 billion Euros a year, you inflate the prices of these commodities. Inflating the prices means that alternative solutions are now relatively cheaper which is what he claims happened with coal pricing that became more economically attractive and was used more hence the elevated CO2 emissions. 

On the side he mentioned that in order to ""save the planet"", Germany has been ruining it's own environment, ecosystem and forests in the process. Renewable energy mechinery takes up a lot of space and this means that wind turbines must be installed sometimes within forests, which must be cut down (in order to create pathways to the installation location and for subsequent service requirements) which impacts everything. On top of that wind turbines are responsible for a 1000/year deaths of rare birds of prey/raptor species (of which you have only 12000 in total) and an additional 240.000 bats per year (which they avoid wind turbine blades with their sonar only to pass through them and burst their lungs at the low-pressure area behind the blades - I bet NO legislator ever predicted that!!). The German government is said to aim for 50000 wind turbines to be implemented which means that you'll end up with a wind turbine for every 2.5 km of landscape of German land! That's a lot of turbines to be installed with dubious end-results.

The professor says that the politics behind it is not that well-intentioned to begin with because all the people that actually raise an alarm on the obvious environmental impact of this plan are stifled by ""ecologists"" who operate on the immoral principle that the ends justify the means. And the end result for them is supposedly clear when it is clearly NOT!

805,"&gt; If you read about non-refoulement you will see that this is far from clear and settled how it has to be interpreted in these cases.

The only part where the application of the non-refoulement principle is even discussed is concerning private boats. It clearly states that it would be illegal for state actors and navy vessels to do so. 

&gt; It basically says because the government says its not safe its not a safe place as far as maritime law. 

There is no reason to doubt the classification of the foreign office on Libya in this regard. This classification wasn't political. 

&gt; If EU countries had the will to do it they could easily support camps there with food, shelter and medical support. Then return to a harbor actually fullfills the basic human needs as the maritime law requires.

Except there are no government-operated camps there. Libya is a failed state without a central government controlling the country. Establishing these camps would require consent of the Libyan ""government"" and military deployments to guard this. 

&gt; I get that you have a different interpretation but please don't say I am wrong when I say its not 100% settled when many areas of ""Völkerrecht"" and international law seldom are.

I challenge you to find respected legal scholars arguing that deportation to Libya would be legal. 

&gt; And if some law is interpreted against the will and good of the peoples then it needs to be amended or changed anyway like in an additional arrangement between the involved countries. 

This is not how laws work. I also do not see how you can change the maritime law for the better. 

&gt; The maritime laws clear intention is that you don't rescue peoples from sea and then put them onto a remote island, in a desert or in a warzone. It is not an instrument to guarantee migration to richer countries because you argue the poorer countries are always less safe. The basic needs can be provided for in Libya in refugee camps and the EU can easily give money for that and help to organize. Another option would be to have refugee camps on the Tunisian border that is also closer than Malta or Lampedusa.

Here's the issue: Of course, maritime law shouldn't allow people to move freely to Europe. But unless the EU (or anyone else) actually creates the camps you are suggesting (or ensures in a different way that the conditions are good enough), deportation to these countries can not happen legally. 

&gt; Another option would be to have refugee camps on the Tunisian border that is also closer than Malta or Lampedusa.

In the same year, France played a pivotal role in the 2011 military intervention in Libya against Muammar Gaddafi. The year after, France intervened in Mali during that country's civil war, as Islamist militants appeared to threaten the south after seizing control of the arid north. Changes in the government of France, including Socialist François Hollande becoming president in 2012 after years of center-right governance, have done little to alter Paris' foreign policy in Africa.

&gt;Hollande also proposed French military involvement in the Syrian civil war in the wake of chemical attacks French intelligence reports linked to the forces of President Bashar al-Assad in mid-2013.

830,"&gt; It's just simple logic: not all jews are Israeli, so blaming all jews, especially European jews, for the actions of Israel is nothing but ignorant. 

of course - nobody claimed otherwise. But its easy to hold that belief for us, who were never directly affected by Israeli bombs or Israeli army.

Our view is not clouded by Israelis killing and imprisoning our closest family members. You get a whole another biased and clouded view of the matter when your sister, brother, mother etc was killed by Israeli Jewish state apparatus.

&gt;  I can still make group judgements of migrants or other groups based on evidence, 

? so basically there are no good immigrants? Not a single one? Every single one (or even just wast majority of them) are coming here just to commit crimes?

Is this what you are claiming?

&gt; but conflating Jews and Israelis is nothing but a false equivalency. 

sure - I was explaining perspective - its not the same to hold this view as someone unaffected by crimes of Israeli state, and as someone who is directly affected by it.

&gt;  I can also be critical of Islam because of the teachings as it can be attacked like any set of ideas.

? sure you can - just like you can be critical of Christianity, Judaism, Budhism or any other set of ideas - capitalism, monarchism, communism etc 

Nobody ever brought that up.

&gt; You can be critical of Judaism, but when you are critical of jews, as if they were some global monolith, is when you are anti-semitic. 

of course - same applies to immigrants - right?

they are not all the same - most of them comes to Europe in search for better life and they want to work hard and achieve their dreams. For sure we should help those people and not conflate them with small portion of immigrants who come here and commits a crime.

852,"&gt;Sorry but Macron didn't accuse Italy of being behind the recent clash it is actually the opposite

He keeps criticizing about the migrants issue acting like the EU Golden Boy pro-open borders and then literally refuse any migrant trying to cross the border from Italy. 

This idiotic critiques obviously triggers replies. 

&gt;And France took in more than 400,000 asylum seekers on the past five years so the decision to close the border was eventually justified (especially when you know that Italy doesn't send back any economic migrant)

They were almost all already recognized as legit asylum seekers and not illegals. You're talking about numbers that mean completely different things. France has never ever faced the problem of deal in with mass illegal immigration, it just comes to first landing countries and for the 90% accurately chose migrants among those already recognized as true refugees (like also Germany, Sweden, etc) 

So don't speak like that random 400.000 is giving France any right to teach italy what in facts france itself has never faced

Yet again and again on Reddit (not just here) I see conspiracies about how the USA toppled them for oil, how the USA wanted to spark the migration crisis and destablize Europe, how Hillary Clinton instigated the conflict in order to kill Gadhaffi, and especially how Gadhaffi's plans for a Pan-African currency were meant to threaten the petrodollar. It's sad, because they got so close with that last conspiracy theory, but it's the CFA franc and not the petrodollar that would be threatened. 

I'm all for chastising the USA for making stupid/greedy/shortsighted foreign policy interventions. However, I'm sick of the USA being the scapegoat of the West since Iraq.

I agree that the EU has contributed to the change of modus operandi in Europe by eliminating one of the tools to settle disputes - the use of armed force. But, firstly, it wasn't just the EU that did it, it was the unique geopolitical conditions that Europe found itself in after WW2 - i.e. the emerging CW, the protective umbrella of the US and the threat of the Soviet Union in the East all massively contributed to the peace between Western European countries.

That being said, none of this has yet eliminated the basic dynamics of international relations in Europe. Countries still more or less function as independent units, they just voluntarily seized some parts of their sovereignity to the EU because they found it to be more profitable. They still hold the vast majority of power though, it's not the EU institutions that control the tax revenues of the member countries, they don't control their foreign policies nor their militaries. The EU member states still have the power and the authority to push for its own interests and they continue to do so, they just use different tools compared to the pre-WW2 period.

There is no solidarity in the EU in the sense that countries would put the interests of other member above theirs or even just at the same level. Everyone still puts their own interests first.

955,"&gt; At various points in history we have been the wealthiest region in the world

The ganges river produces the most calories per acre in the world. The result of this is that any civilization that is near that river will grow very big very fast. The way we measure the wealth of ancient civilizations is faulty because we measure by using GDP which measures production. Most production in the ancient world was from agriculture. I can see how by estimates that India was measured as the ""wealthiest"" but in reality India was extremely poor with huge swath of very poor farmers who had to work tirelessly all day just to have something for themselves to eat. The river valleys generating such a huge population in comparison to the world can make it seem very wealthy by gdp measures in the ancient world. Like anywhere else only kings would be rich. Also, ""India"" did not exist in such a unified way back then. South Asia was ruled by many small kingdoms for most of it's existence. India's past will never offer a glimpse of the future in the way optimists would like. If India does become rich it will be based on entirely new ground they are approaching.

Laurence Norman and Drew Hinshaw | Photographs by Piotr Malecki for The Wall Street Journal
11-14 minutes

The European Union has spent nearly $1 trillion to unify the continent by delivering highways and trains into places where there were once gravel paths. In current dollars, that is over eight times the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe after World War II. The EU has bought airports and bridges, trams and swimming pools. It has repaired castles and medieval churches.

It hasn’t bought love.

To the vexation of European leaders, some of the biggest recipients of funding are now hotbeds of discontent, brimming with voters disquieted by the cultural and political pressures that have accompanied European integration, and threatening the bloc’s cohesion.

A renovated kindergarten in Lapy, Poland, sits near a bright blue billboard reading “Financed by the European Union.” The EU bankrolls one-fifth of Lapy’s budget, improved its sewage system and built an office complex for startups. Locals meanwhile overwhelmingly support Poland’s governing nationalist party, which says the EU overrides Polish sovereignty, condescends to Poles and threatens religious values.

“There must be respect,” said Lapy Mayor Urszula Jablonska, seated in her office between an EU flag and a crucifix. Were Poland to hold a Brexit-like referendum, she said she’s unsure of how she would vote. “I would have to consider our national values.”

Since the 1970s, the EU has shifted wealth across borders on a scale rarely attempted, under programs now called “cohesion funding.” Between 2000 and 2020, the EU is on track to spend around €858 billion ($992 billion) on needy regions or countries, chosen because their economic output per person is below 90% of the EU average.

The operation speaks to an ambition as grand as its price tag: To remake a continent of nations once divided by the traumas of the 20th century into a politically and economically unified Europe. The money has modernized infrastructure, raised living standards in the poorest regions, eased poverty and opened new markets.

The dissatisfaction stems in part from economic pain that this funding can’t soothe, given that the money is spread across the EU’s 28 members. Mixed in are thornier debates over issues such as sovereignty, cultural identity and respect. It stretches from small towns in Europe’s richest nations, including Britain and France, to struggling regions in fast growing post-Communist economies such as Poland and Hungary.

Many are ambivalent about the construction projects and wary of the accompanying strings.

“Local people had no attachment to all this new Tarmac or bricks and mortar,” said Nick Smith, an opposition Labour Party lawmaker in Wales, whose constituents voted overwhelmingly for Britain in 2016 to leave the EU.

The biggest recipient of EU cohesion funds in mainland France is Nord-Pas-de-Calais, once an industrial powerhouse of coal, steel and textiles. In Parliament, it is represented by Marine Le Pen, the French presidential runner-up who proposed France hold an EU exit referendum.

Cohesion funds didn’t stop Brexit, where voters bristled at Britain’s EU bill. The EU’s current seven-year budget, which runs through 2020, earmarked €2 billion in cohesion funds for west Wales and Welsh Valleys, a region dotted with once-thriving steel factories and mining towns.

Many locals say EU funding was overshadowed by the disadvantages of membership, including the obligation to accept migrants from other EU nations. Blaenau Gwent voters favored Brexit by 62% to 38% to leave the EU. It was Wales’ highest “leave” vote.

“The money, we got our share, but it’s more important to save Wales,” said Ken Sullivan, a retired coal miner. Britain became “so open to foreigners, it was easy to be overrun with different cultures.”

The future of the EU still hangs in the balance, with divisions over refugees in particular driving wedges between its member states. If copious spending during decades of European optimism couldn’t revive fading communities or unite the continent, EU officials worry about what comes next. Rising nationalism is pitting smaller, eastern countries against larger, western powers.

That is informing debate over the EU’s next seven-year budget, which starts in 2021. Cohesion cash, which accounts for over one-third of the EU’s 2014-20 €1 trillion budget, is under the knife. Britain’s payments will start to diminish after its planned exit from the EU next year, which would force the EU to cut spending or demand more cash from Europe’s capitals.

Officials are considering shifting tens of billions of euros in aid from Europe’s east to its economically struggling south, including to EU founding-member Italy, where a new antiestablishment government is injecting fresh uncertainty into the bloc’s future.

“This is a highly political exercise and not an accounting one,” Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the EU’s executive commission, said during an April EU conference on cohesion policy, in which he opposed deep cuts. “At its essence cohesion policy is about making sure that the life chances in Europe are not dictated…by accident of birthplaces.”

Cohesion funding has transformed recipients, initially along the Mediterranean and in Ireland, and then in the ex-communist countries that joined in 2004. Europe’s fastest-growing economies depend on the cash flow. In 11 of the EU’s 28 states, EU funding accounted for more than 40 cents of every euro governments spent on infrastructure, land and buildings between 2015 and 2017.

In some places, such as Western Europe, the EU sometimes markets its assistance poorly and voters are often unclear about the EU role in a mix of regional, national and European funding.

EU funding can carry onerous rules and stipulations involving complex paperwork and restrictions on project types, irking recipients. East European nationalists allege that much of the money flows back to German and French construction companies.

Donor countries have soured on cohesion funds, too, partly because of alleged corruption among recipients. In Hungary, where skepticism of the EU runs thick, the bloc’s antifraud agency says $47.8 million spent upgrading street lamps through EU contracts awarded to a company once owned by Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s son-in-law contained “serious irregularities” that may constitute fraud. The son-in-law denies the accusation. Mr. Orban says Hungary no longer needs EU cash.

In April, Mr. Orban won a landslide fourth term, campaigning against the EU, which he said would force refugees on Hungary. “Stop Brussels,” read government-financed pamphlets sent to homes. (The EU is calling his bluff. Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic all face 20% cohesion fund cuts under current plans.)

Few cohesion-funding recipients are in such direct conflict with donors as Poland, which is allotted more than €60 billion under the current cohesion budget.

The ruling Law and Justice party is purging a 110-seat Supreme Court on the grounds that about eight of those judges served under Communism. The EU says the purge undercuts judicial independence and so triggered a never-used procedure that could fine Poland and limit its voting rights in the bloc. A decision is pending. Brussels has also sued Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for refusing to accept refugees as part of the EU-wide relocation plan.

Donor countries including France and Germany want future spending linked more tightly to upholding EU norms. Some Polish voters and officials call such conditions, which Brussels plans to adopt, attacks on their sovereignty by hostile western elites.

In Lapy, a town of 16,000 surrounded by beet fields, residents had voted 2 to 1 to join the EU in 2003. European assistance, however, struggled to offset the economic upheaval that followed the collapse of communism. In 2008, doors closed at the antiquated, state-owned sugar factory that had converted 370,000 tons of beets into 60,000 tons of sugar annually, leaving 250 people jobless. Farmers who had bought specialized beet reapers watched crops rot. Locals blamed EU sugar quotas. The next year, a train-repair yard cut most of its 700 workers.

Foreign supermarkets opened, hurting local merchants. Consumers bought imported goods with money wired home by young people who had relocated to thriving Polish cities and other countries.

Religious leaders began to question whether the European Community shares the same values as this overwhelmingly Catholic country. They have watched closely as Ireland, another Catholic EU member, voted to allow abortion and same-sex marriage. Most Poles have indicated they want to stay in the EU. Independent polls at home show they also feel wary about giving Brussels, the EU’s unofficial capital, more power.

The EU “would prefer that Poland not have a say, and instead do everything that they want,“ said Tadeusz Brzosko, a beet farmer outside Lapy. “Poles know our own mind and we will do what we see fit.”

In 2002, at a summit in Copenhagen dubbed “One Europe,” European leaders charted a rosy vision of what their money would accomplish. The gathering capped three years of debate over whether Poland and nine other nations should join as full members and receive economic assistance similar to that which had previously poured into Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal.

Development funding would help turn Poles into consumers for west European products and services, partly offsetting the cost of assistance, argued advocates such as British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Poland’s then-prime minister, Leszek Miller, said the funds would expunge Western Europe’s failure to save the east from communism. “This was convincing to them,” Mr. Miller said in an interview.

East European leaders returned home touting the money pledged. Some now say this created unrealistic expectations of swift economic change. Among EU enthusiasts, the Copenhagen summit was seen as a step to EU political union—an idea anathema to easterners who had just shed Soviet hegemony.

“This vision was never, never shared in countries like Poland or the Baltic States,” said Günter Verheugen, a German politician who oversaw EU enlargement from 1999 to 2004.

In rural Poland, the proportion of children able to attend preschool has leapt to 84% from 2% in the 1990s, Polish officials say. Thanks in part to EU funds, Poland’s output per capita was forecast to hit 67% of the EU average last year, up from 42% in 1995. The country hasn’t experienced a recession since 1992.

Pro-EU Poles feel the current nationalist government takes credit for an economic turnaround EU money has helped fuel, while blaming the EU for the local businesses that have closed along the way.

Near Lapy’s town square, an EU-funded office complex rents discounted rooms to startups, some given EU grants. Radoslaw Zaremba received $6,500 to launch a photo studio.

When the 30-year-old told his mother about the grant, she told him to be wary because she feared Brussels would want the money paid back, Mr. Zaremba said. For many around Lapy, he said, “the European Union is far away, it’s not familiar, and it’s scary.”",,/r/europe/comments/9d4ifp/the_eu_spent_a_bundle_to_unify_the_continent_its/e5fb340/,Ummland,1536137679

(I do have WoS/SCOPUS publications, since unfortunately it is a requirement for funding agencies, but these are decidedly *not* the works I’m proud of...)

There are obvious limits to bibliometrics. The expected WoS-indexed publication counts are wildly different for different fields. For instance: in medicine,  already Msc.-level student grant holders at our uni are expected to produce a WoS publication from the project; in computer science, most of the important stuff gets published at conferences and perhaps except for the 1-2 top journals in a sub-field, you would choose to submit to a journal with an IF only to tick off the proper boxes for a funding source of choice (and it’s quite a bit easier to get into those journals,  including the best ones, than to get to the top conferences).

Full disclosure: Yes, I am in CS, so I have the luxury of therefore not caring too much: bibliometrics are for us mostly a necessary evil, since we can share and evaluate each other’s work directly when it becomes relevant — we publish nearly everything in open-access venues anyway, and then also on arXiv, so I don’t have a big dog in this fight...

""In practice, emissions in the order of 150-200 kilos of carbon dioxide equivalents per kilowatt-hour means that an electric car with a 100kWh battery will thus have emitted 15-20 tons of carbon dioxide even before the vehicle ignition is turned on. One of the authors, Mats-Ola Larsson, reportedly said that this is the same amount of emissions as driving a gasoline car for 8,2 years.[51] However, Popular Mechanics calculates that even if the 15-20 tons estimate is correct, it would only take 2.4 years of driving for the electric car with a 100kWh battery to recover the greenhouse emissions from the battery manufacturing. It however does not calculate in the emissions from battery replacements (battery replacement of regular lithium-ion batteries needs to be done every 2–3 years; lithium-ion batteries from cars typically last longer though).[52][53][54][55] Furthermore, two other studies suggest a 100kWh battery would generate about 6-6.4 tons of CO2 emissions, so significantly less than what the IVL study claims.""

Just by asking a few electric car owners; one of the sentences here is already not accurate (""battery replacement of regular lithium-ion batteries needs to be done every 2–3 years"") I've talked to multiple Tesla, Leaf, BMW and Opel Ampera (not really a full EV, though it is driven by electricity and batteries only) that have had batteries functioning for more than 3 years. Also say if your typical gasoline car today would realistically produce 150g of co2 per kilometer driven, you'd only need to drive ~260k km if an equivalent electric car would produce 75g of co2 per kilometer. This is calculated simply by dividing the _worst_ estimate of 20 tons of co2 by 75g of co2 saved per kilometer. Of course this is not currently going to apply in countries like Poland for example, where their energy mix generates a lot more than 500g of co2 per kWh! https://www.electricitymap.org/?page=map&amp;solar=false&amp;remote=true&amp;wind=false

If you calculate true emissions for countries like Norway and Sweden however, a 2,4 ton Tesla would for example consume about 300Wh/km on average in it's lifetime considering vampire draw etc. This would mean that an co2 produced per kilometer would be about 1/3 of the average co2 produced by the electricity generation. In Sweden it would equal to (CI of electricity consumed at LV from here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920916307933 ) So in total comparing to a gasoline car producing 150g/km, a Tesla would be ahead after just ~150k km (20000 kg/(150-(47*0,3))g). For a smaller electric and gasoline car the calculation would be similar, (20000 kg/(120-(47*0,18))g) coming to about 180k km. Now say the actual co2 production is closer to the 5-10 tons mentioned, (7500 kg/(120-(47*0,18))g), you'd only need to drive around 3-5 years with average of 15k per year to be polluting less.

Personally I wouldn't even care if an electric car would only be equal, or even slightly worse, to a gasoline car in it's lifetime, since I'd much rather have the most efficient electricity generation producing the rather clean pollutants, compared to inhaling all the diesel soot and NOx that is produced by any car today. However considering just the effiency of electricity generation, transportation and use in an electric motor, I doubt electric car's would not succeed.

I don't see why you're dividing Scottish and English people when you both elect MPs to the same parliament at Westminster. What you described is exactly how democracy is supposed to work: majority rule. A system like the Electoral College gives smaller populations disproportionately greater weight, which is unfair and undemocratic. 

Scotland already has its own devolved parliament anyway; if you think Scotland needs more representation, there are far better ways to do it than electoral colleges.

What do you think ethnicity means?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity

&gt; An ethnic group or an ethnicity, is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities such as common ancestry, language, history, society, culture or nation.[1][2] Ethnicity is usually an inherited status based on the society in which one lives. Membership of an ethnic group tends to be defined by a shared cultural heritage, ancestry, origin myth, history, homeland, language or dialect, symbolic systems such as religion, mythology and ritual, cuisine, dressing style, art or physical appearance.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalans

&gt; The Catalans (Catalan, French and Occitan: catalans; Spanish: catalanes, Italian: catalani) are a Romance[5] ethnic group native to Catalonia,

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_people

&gt; The Swahili people (or Waswahili) are an ethnic and cultural group inhabiting East Africa. 

By the way, I'm a Catalan, I speak Swahili and I've been in the Swahili coast and met many ethnic Swahilis.

In the humour show les guignols de l'info his minister of the interior was depicted has a racist who went hunting for foreigners with his dog and a rifle in the street of Paris. One of his main support, Morano, claimed that France is historically ""of white race"" (in a country where the word ""race"" has become meaningless for the majority of the population decades ago) and that people coming over the Mediterranean should just be send back on boat (in the sense : ""they're on a boat, push it back, if they die who cares ?"") and, when told she's racist, explained that she isn't because her best friend ""is darker than an Arab"". During the terrorist attacks of Mohamed Mera (I think ?) one of the soldier killed was black, Sarkozy called him ""a Muslim by appearance"".

1492,"&gt; We are now taught to recognize race so that we can distinguish who should get 'special attention'

Americans are, because Americans still consider race a vital idea in their society. They still measure statistics by race, they still judge based on race, and their history of treatment to anyone that they didn't consider white at the time (because the white definition changed) is to be desired at best. And, worst part of all, it's still VERY fresh. There's many people alive today that lived under racial segregation, under a government that exploited them, experimented on them, stolen their land, were put in concentration camps... All those things happened in the last 60 years.

So, they get a hard backlash, and a needed one. One that almost every other racist nation had to go at some point.

1510,"&gt; We can see a persons skull and determine the race without seeing his skin color.

You can determine a physical aspect of the person, and not very accurately. But that doesn't mean the concept of race is valid. 

Let me put it this way : People are not colorblind. We CAN see someone has darker or lighter skin, and that has certain facial characteristics. That's completely true and would be ridiculous to deny. 

But does that mean that it goes beyond that? Genetically speaking, we are almost identical. Sure, two black parents will very likely have a black son, but ... who is black and who isn't? America has certain political distinctions to determine who they think is black and who isn't. Those lines are different than the ones in Africa. Those lines don't mean anything in Europe, where most statistics don't differentiate between skin color. 

I'm not tiptoeing around anything. I'm not denying the existence of physical differences between humans, what i mean is that : 

1) You can't determine absolutely anything about that person's character, intelligence, abilities or anything like that.

2) We can't agree on what determines the line between ""races"". White means something for some, and it means something else for others. Are jewish people white? What about armenians? For some people, it's completely obvious that Spaniards or Italians are white, for others, it's an absurd idea. 

Here's a good example that came from another chat with a redditor : How did the Spaniards classify people based on race during the Americas conquest. While some distinctions were stuff like ""Black"" or ""Indian"", then you had different definitions based on HOW black was someone, or even if you were white based on if you were born in the Americas (even from Spanish parents) or born in Spain. And all of those had an impact on how you were perceived by society and how laws applied to you.

To most Americans, eastern Europeans are obviously white, but the Nazis considered them subhuman, at the same level as gypsies or Jews. 

There is no absolute definition of race, because race is a complete social construct. 

3) No, calling those ideas is not disingenuous at all. Almost no XVIII century science is still viewed in the same light as at the time. For Cuvier, evolution was an absurd idea, but now we know better. For a lot of people, Phrenology was a completely valid scientific field, and it was based on skull shape, by the way. Now we know better. 

And we are not at the ""end"" of science, we are still moving forward, and we are challenging the ideas of not only race, but gender, sexuality, psychology and so on. Freud is hugely important to understand Psychoanalysis, and it's still studied everywhere, but most modern psychologists will challenge his ideas.

4) Anthropology is the field of study that studies human beings and, to a point, their behavior. You are absolutely right. Sociology is the field of study that studies human societies and how humans interact with each other. They are literally in the same area of knowledge, and use very similar methods. In fact, there's a lot of overlap and interdisciplinary studies between fields like Anthropology, History, Sociology, Economy, even Psychology and obviously Philosophy.

I think (correct me if i'm wrong) you are confusing Sociology with Socialism. The second is a left to far-left political ideology. Being that you post a LOT in right-wing subs, i wouldn't be surprised if you had a strong dislike for Socialism.

1525,"I’m a linguist! Historical linguistics is not my feat, but I’ll try to explain how it works. There basically three factors to establishing genealogy of languages, it’s not strange that you are confused!

In order to determine whether languages are related, we use a certain list of words called the “swadesh list”. This list consists of words that are very unlikely to be loaned from other languages (it mainly has words for body parts and stuff like “moon” and “sun”). So “bread” in your example may not be a good word to compare because it is likely to be loaned (and thus not representative of a languages ancestry).

Secondly, you want to find and compare *cognates* and not *translations*. Cognates are words that have the same *root*, but not necessarily the same meaning. So for instance, you do not want to compare Eng. “Garden” to Russ. “Sad” (not cognates, same meaning) but you want to compare Eng. “Garden” to Russ. “Grad” (which means “city”. These are cognates, but have a different meaning).

Thirdly, you want to compare the oldest known version of  languages with each other. If languages are related, it means that at one point in history the two languages were one single language and then were separated. The further we go forward in time the more two related languages start developing differences, meaning that modern versions of languages have often obscured their genealogy with time and that older versions of languages can give us a much better idea of their relation to other languages.  For this reason it is better to compare for example Old-Norse to Old Church Slavonic rather than compare Swedish with Bulgarian. We know for sure Swedish developed from Old-Norse and Bulgarian developed from OCS, so if we can establish that Old-Norse and OCS are related it also follows that Swedish and Bulgarian are related even though in modern times these languages differ a lot from each other!

1537,"&gt; EU like Amazon, Netflix, Google and Facebook.

Netflix has a lot of competitors: In Finland there's at least C-More (owned by Swedish Telia; former Canal+ Nordic) and ViaPlay (owned by the Swedish ViaSat). I'm relatively sure that the continent has more: Canal+ at least exists. And of course, The public broadcasting corporations run their own streaming services. The Finnish one is really good.

We don't have anything as centralised as Amazon, but there is a lot of smaller companies like CDON that scratch the same itch. Amazon doesn't even operate in Finland, you have to order stuff from Germany or Britain. Dunno how big the company is there. 

Google-the-search-engine is incredibly dominant, of course. Google-the-company has competitors in Vimeo (Youtube), email (several providers), cloud storage etc.  Not having a big central company to run most of services would in general be a good thing, if together they could keep Google's market share lower. Alas, synergy...

And of course, Facebook is facebook. There aren't really anything else there, and it's pretty easy to guess why: fractured languages means that it's very hard to build critical mass for services like this in Europe. Social networks (in the sense of what people have irl) are more limited by state limits, which make building services on top of them much harder.  

And of course there's the European approach to registries, which pretty much mean that most ""European-used"" services are located in the USA.

1573,"&gt; Because that's the reality of the world we live in. Danish, German, Irish, Greek, Finnish, Portuguese etc. etc. people generally have no interest in watching Belgian dramas or Austrian comedies. If they did they'd already be incredibly popular and all over our cinemas etc. There's a reason that they're not, people don't want to watch that stuff.

That's not how markets really work. How many high profile Belgian dramas and Austrian comedies are being produced? How much media exposure do they get relative to their US counterparts? In fact the Dardenne Brothers actually produce some excellent Belgian dramas. 2 Days One Night was one of my favorite films of its year.

People do not have an eagles perspective on the market and get to pick just what they want to watch. They pick something from the selection in front of them. 

&gt; I agree but why would Netflix etc. care about that?

Because of EU laws?

&gt; So Netflix has no reason to try and promote actually good stuff from the EU when it's much cheaper to just stock up on cheap, old junk that nobody wants to watch. Just find some old German shows from the 80s etc. to meet the EU-quota and they can continue focusing on the most popular stuff regardless of where it's from.

If they only pile up on bad shows and movies it will probably make the service less attractive. Especially because of this sentence that many seem to have overread: ""The services will also likely have to make sure the local content has prominent placement in their libraries.""

[What Amazon Prime has to offer when it comes to german films is actually not half bad](https://www.moviepilot.de/filme/beste/land-deutschland/online-amazon-prime)

&gt; On top of that EU will always have language problems, people generally only watch their own language and English stuff. Then once in a while there will be an exception like a Danish show like Borgen, a French movie like The Intouchables etc. that's fairly popular but they're rare exceptions, not the norm. People in EU don't generally watch Danish or French shows or movies, in fact they don't even know about the vast majority of them. A large part of the reason is simply the language, English is just much easier to follow for most people and that's not going to change simply because EU introduces some new law.

No, Europe is not Denmark, dude, get out of Copenhagen.

Can we move on from YOUR outdated definition of race and use some common sense to accurately call a spade a spade? You clearly don't know what science is because you continue to bring up things that are irrelevant to the subject at hand. 

We can test and find out what race a human skull belongs to using simple observation. We can look at 1000 skulls and we can determine 1000 times to what race that skull belongs to. THAT'S science.

I'll concede that science isn't the end all. Absolutely. Science does not make claims, it only produces results. It observes and tests hypothesis and if out of 1000 times you get the same result, we conclude that the hypothesis is correct.

It's extremely telling that you also lump race with gender and sexuality. Another insane attempt to undermine science without a shred of evidence to support the claim. Gender is fluid or sexuality is fluid or what ever ridiculous AND non-tested claim the non-scientists make.

So when things get labeled as right wing (like these Syrians) it'll later be used in a statistic showing that the real problem in Germany (or anywhere else) isn't foreigners but the increase in right wing activities, even though those activities were performed by foreigners. They'll just leave that out of their numbers.

When people hear about ""Growing antisemitism in Germany."", ""Far right rhetoric on the rise in Germany."" etc. they immediately think of white skinheads, and not Syrians refugees. So you can bet your ass that stuff like this story is going to be used by our fellow lefties as proof that Germany is starting to turn Nazi again within a short time.

When a rise in a certain type of attacks is caused by a specific group of people for a specific reason, it's utterly dishonest to just use the vague ""right wing attack"" to make it sound like it's just how Germans or French people suddenly are. 

We get the same here in Denmark as well, there'll be a story about antisemitism being on the rise or whatever and by reading the story you'd never guess that it's all from Muslim immigrants, even though I've never heard a single Danish Jew ever claim that it's caused by your average Dane turning more antisemitic. They're very clear about who's attacking them, vandalizing their schools etc. but it's just never how the issue is presented.

1640,"&gt;Lol, ok. This is exceedingly vague analogizing that really has no worth in a discussion about scientific methodology.

What? Dude, this is what it is. Take diversity, it has also many facets, there are various measures of diversity that transform it into single dimension, single number. But different measures of diversity can show a different part of it. Or just when you try to put distribution of some values into single number, you can chose average, median, standard deviation, all of them will tell you something different about the distribution. Some of them are more useful then other.

&gt;But, to play along, IQ testing is a single brush stoke on a multidimensional painting. It's only important on its own if you are only looking at that one spot. 

Thats not true at all, same as average can have many different applications. Sure, sometimes median is better if you want to look at the numbers in different way, but that does not mean that average is useless if you are looking only at average, whatever it means.

This is just a standard practice in science. And while in averages and medians you kind of know what is happening with these numbers and when it might be better, there are measures where stuff like that is virtually unknown and often you chose the one that performs better for the task that you are doing. Again, this is not vague analogizing or incomplete analogy, this is basic science and if you were doing some data processing, you would have to do these decisions all the time (I have some very recent experience with that).",,/r/europe/comments/9ctdjc/the_italian_geneticist_who_dismantled_the_concept/e5ebav9/,Unicorn_Colombo,1536094429

He's a CSU-style conservative to be sure, but of all the German conservatives there are, he's probably the most centrist.

Given that he has no real power base within the party, he might have had a real shot at the party chair, since all the other factions gridlocked each other into a stalemate - a classic setup for a 'great compromiser' to rise to power. 

He's been repeatedly called back home to arbitrate between Seehofer, Söder (both CSU) and Merkel (CDU), most prominently during the Merkel/Seehofer standoff a few months back.

He certainly isn't an ideological crusader and has been noted for his ability to reach across party lines. If you think that's boring, he isn't your man.

1708,"&gt;This patently false. Aside from removing the Cossacks (which is a complicated issue on it's own, and I would happily discuss) they didn't do anything that could be considered genocide. 

This is blatant whitewashing of Soviet crimes.

&gt;Remember, genocide has a specific definition.

And remember, they did it several times.

&gt;Because I didn't think you wanted to go into a lengthy discussion about the nature of the relationship between the Cossacks, Don or otherwise, and the various states they lived in so as to understand why the suppression of their culture, while certainly wrong in a vacuum, saved countless lives.

Yeah, I don't understand that argument.

&gt;It matter because anti-communist propagandists regularly make vague statements and blur events together in such a way as to make distinct social, economic, and war-time phenomena seem like an unbroken string of ""evil.""

There is no such concept as ""anti-communist propagandists"". Everything right goes by default against a sick ideology like communism.

&gt;The absurdity of any claim you might have made about the famine would be contained within your likely misunderstanding of events based on Nazi campaigns of deliberate misinformation.

While you arguing here is a direct result of lacking knowledge wanting to make excuses for the Soviets or for communism.

&gt;In short, the story that western propaganda tells goes something like ""Stalin was a dictator and an evil man. He wanted to change the agricultural system in the Soviet breadbasket, but because socialism is terrible it didn't work so he starved 40 million people to cover it up."" There are variations of course, but the main idea is the same.

I hardly think that's true...

Stalin was just a horrible implementer of a horrible ideology.

&gt;This was not genocide. This was a government punishing murderous criminals and alleviating famine.

Or is a nationalist someone that will promote their nation above any other? Both uses of the term is correct, but it depends on context and how you use it.

&gt;decent correlation between IQ and financial success in the modern world

That seems to be an example of the exact kind of issues I see in this assessment of intelligence across populations. Financial success is dependent on so many factors, one of the least of which in my opinion, despite what we tell ourselves, is intelligence.  Furthermore, this suggests you are looking at diverse populations just within the United States or Europe - because there are all number of different economic structures across the globe, and I doubt any of these studies consider total global financial performance in the context of each varying national/cultural economic structure. So you are essentially comparing small groups of immigrant outsiders in a country and saying financial success equates to intelligence, which as someone who has actually spent quite a lot of time in various fields, is anecdotally the furthest thing from the truth. I've dealt repeatedly with members of every social and economic strata in my work, and after a substantial bump in perceived ""intelligence"" as you rise from poverty to (the modern-type of) subsistence-level middle class, where you have enough time and wealth to provide children with the bare minimum attention and resources, the higher you go it truly seems like the lack of intelligence increases. 

I agree we shouldn't shy away from looking at anything in a truly scientific manner, but it's foolish to pretend like even now this area isn't rife with the exact psuedoscience and racist manipulators you mention. 

There's no point proclaiming things like your ranking of IQ test performance, for this very reason. It's spreading psuedoscience. ",,/r/europe/comments/9ctdjc/the_italian_geneticist_who_dismantled_the_concept/e5e34nf/,blomqv,1536087284

1740,"&gt;it doesn't mean you don't enjoy rakı.

you don't.

let me explain why Turks drink rakı

You see, our school of Islam (Hanafi) is against wine. I don't know why but Hanafi madhab is fiercely against wine. So is Islam. So drinking wine was a taboo. But that obviously couldn't repress some Turks' need for alcohol. They needed something to get drunk. Beer was produced by local christians and they didn't sell beer to muslims (haram). Boza that the Turks produced wasn't enough to get you drunk (because alcohol content is around 1%). So instead some Turks introduced Arak to Anatolia. Arak turned into Rakı. THe only reason why that drink became so famous was simple: There were no alternatives. This is why this horrible, this tasteless drink became so famous. 

If I went back in time and shot whoever introduced Arak, and instead brought 3 bottles of whiskey with me and sold it to the Turks we would have a ""Viski Kültürü"" instead of ""Rakı kültürü rakı adabı hajuuuuuum"".

1761,"&gt; The reality is that different groups of humans score differently on IQ tests, even if you control for environmental factors.

It isn't feasible for *all* of the environmental factors that could plausibly have a huge impact on intelligence to be controlled for, short of doing something completely inhumane like taking a bunch of embryos, implanting them into randomly-chosen surrogate mothers and then raising the kids in randomly-chosen environments in which the people who raise them and interact with them are somehow prevented from seeing any indication of what race they are.

In other words, your claim is *far* too unequivocal.

&gt; European Jews &gt; East Asians &gt; Europeans &gt; Indians, Arabs, Southeast Asians and American Aboriginals &gt; Africans &gt; Australian Aboriginals

These are folk races, not biologically meaningful categories. I also don't see this ordering in any of the articles you linked to, which makes me wonder whether you made it up or got it from a source that you don't want to share with us for some reason.

&gt; A lot of people say this topic should be shunned because it's offensive and brings up associations with shitty racist groups, but to me this seems like ignoring science based on ideology

Who says that, exactly? I suspect that people tend to avoid the topic because it hasn't been a very fruitful area of research, and because white supremacists are obsessed with it and nobody wants to have to deal with them or be associated with them. And I'm giving you a huge benefit of the doubt by sticking to the third person here.

&gt; Let's say a genius is someone with an IQ over 130, well, some groups will have a lot more of them than other groups, and that could explain why certain groups more easily rise to the very top levels of society in highly technical, financial or academic fields.

We already have a pretty compelling explanation for this. It also explains why people from rich families are more likely to achieve success than people from poor families, why immigrants to a wealthy country from a poor country are more likely to achieve success than the people back home, and so on.

&gt; Racists will say that differences are entirely due to biology, but we all know this is not true. However, people also force their ideology and say that differences are entirely due to environment (poverty, circumstances, culture, etc), and this is also not true. In reality, it's a bit of both.

*How do you know* it's a bit of both? You can't just assume that the truth is half way between whatever two opposing views you have decided to identify.

But I do find it funny that you try to chalk it up to racism.

Yeah it is racist as you see. You literally said ""i don't care Turks because they are invaders"".

1813,"&gt;Not races though. Or if you say it can, feel free to share your definition of race.

This is just semantics. If you don't want to call them races, you can call them subspecies, or even groups, whatever. 

The point is that humans differ genetically according geographical location due to their separate evolution over hundreds of thousands/millions of years in different environments. Again - if you gave a scientist your saliva, he could tell you where you're from. How do you reconcile that with your view of race?

&gt;Why ? That's non-sense. Mixing would in all likelihood lead to more genetic diversity, hence more difference rather than become more uniform.

Critical thinking clearly is not your strong suit. Let me put it in very simple terms:

You have 100 fertile Bantu people, and 100 fertile Han Chinese. I'm sure you can admit that each group has more genetic similarity within themselves, than with the other. Now yet them all mix together for several generations, and that genetic difference between the two groups will be gone - the groups entirely will be gone. 

That hasn't happened yet though, and Bantu and Han Chinese still both exist as distinct human groups with much genetic difference, because they evolved extremely far away from each over for over a million years with basically zero mixing between them.

&gt;People that look very similar might be genetically very different.

Except not in practice. 99 times out of 100, you can ask me which continent someone is from, and I will be correct. ""White"" is a very vague term for a native European, yet if you put someone society calls ""White"" in front of me, I will be able to correctly say he's from Europe, rather than Africa, or India etc.

Again, how do you explain this with your ""we're all the same, race doesn't exist"" view?

No that is wrong. 100% horseshit. For example if you do a pca of humanity, it looks like this:
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Principal_components_analysis_of_6%2C209_African_Americans.png

Note how the ancestrally defined population groups of Yoruba, Chinese and Europeans define sharply distinct clusters, with the mixed African Americans being intermediate between clusters? That is race. 

&gt; Well, it invalidates it as anything other than arbitrarily chosen categories based on superficial traits, which is the point.

Those traits go a lot deeper than superficiality.

1851,"For anyone who hasn't made up their mind or wants to know more about the validity of the concept 'race', I think this Wiki is a good introduction for the scientifically literate:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genetic_clustering

My own interpretation is roughly that there are small jumps in genetic distance that correspond to geographical features such as oceans, the sahara and the himalayas etc. 

If you want to call these genetic clusters 'races' then fine, but there isn't that much difference between these clusters.  Individual differences within populations are greater than the differences between populations. These cluster analyses have clear uses when it comes to diagnosing and preventing certain ailments (ancestry/geograhy correlates to genes, which correlate to vulnerability to illness x), so it's not as though the whole endeavor is necessarily motivated by racism or whatever.

Yes, yes it is. Most (poor) young blacks either aspire to be good at sports (or rapping) so that they land in the lime light, or idealize being a hood rat and selling drugs. In urban areas it is much worse because its all they know in most cases. They grow up without fathers and the only male figure they have in their life often comes from the streets.   


&gt; which is higher than other groups in america due to racist policing policy and the insanity of the war on drugs leading to mass incarceration of black males 

The amount of genuine ""racist policing"" that takes place is very rare. There are some police stations that are absolutely corrupt, you are correct. Some have had to rebuild their police force from the ground up (I think this was the case in Seattle where it happened 5 times and it still has issues) but in most cases they are fairly clean.  


&gt;  Also, only people with little to no exposure to African Americans think the entire culture embraces gangster rap and all the crap that goes along with it.

1920,"&gt;You can identify about 3-4 major groups of Africans, which are pretty similar to each other.

There lies the issue, and what Sforza's work is actually about. You can identify 3-4 major groups... based on what? Skin colour? Physical aspect? We are grouping people together based on a few arbitrarily selected characteristics while ignoring everything else. 

Genetic work performed by numerous research has shown that there is immense genetic variety in Sub-Saharan Africa, and that some groups are genetically more distant between each other than Europeans are from Asians overall. Yet just because they have a dark skin colour, we categorise them just as ""black"". That's because we are giving much more important to a couple of traits we see (skin colour, skull shape, you name it) than to hundreds we don't (DNA).

I'm sorry man but it is not racist to say that Turkey is an extraordinarily warmongering nation with an extraordinary tendency towards ethnic cleansing. But I do find it funny that you try to chalk it up to racism. I had a similar discussion with another Turk, and by the end of it he broke down and he admitted that he couldn't leave his shithole of a country. 

&gt;And i answer with another question, did breaking an agreement bring peace or made it worse? Sole reason Turkey is there that nobody stopped Greeks on island, UK was also part of the said agreement. 

Yeah right. If that was the case you could give my mother's house back and still achieve your goals of peace and prosperity. But your goal is not peace. It's ethnic cleansing. Both of us and of the Turkish Cypriots, whom you are assimilating against their will.

1943,"If I were to present you a picture with a Caucasian (Ethnic Swede), African (Ugandan), Asian (Mongolian) and Australian Native, you'd be able to quickly identify which was which quite easily. They have different facial features, hair types, eye colors, etc. From looks alone you can identify that they're quite different. If I took the averages of each ethnicity mentioned one, you'd still be able to do the same, as we're more similar to those we evolved with for 40K years than those we didn't.

But now if I asked about a Syrian, a Pakistani, and an Ethiopian, you might start to hesitate, because they're more similar, due to closer proximity they've blended together more. Rather than being Red Green Blue, we're more in the Yellow to Orange zone. So what would be more appropriate to call this? Well, like colors, we can use a format where we say they're all part caucasian, but one has a mixture of Asian and the other has a mixture of African. However, the Ethnic Swede, Mongolian and Ugandan are still quite clear cut as to their race. 

Mind you, this is only visible differences, it goes further with mental illness and physical disease, as well as muscle development and other features, Caucasians are more prone to mental illnesses like depression, while Africans are more prone to heart disease. If you're mixed, or come from a region that had a history of mixing, then you can be susceptible to both, or neither, one, or the other, based on your mixture and how your genetics played out.

We're all on the color spectrum, but we come from different primary lights. We can blend together and make other lights, but that doesn't mean we're magically no longer the lights that make us. It's important to research this stuff and be serious about it for the sake of identifying medical health, genetic inheritance of issues, and see if we can record differences so as to be able to bolster preventative medicine and curate more effective cures.

It concerned a secret and officially unsanctioned military operation following the Continuation War, where a large amount of Finnish Army weapons and equipment was hidden in caches scattered around the country.
&gt; 
&gt; Following the Moscow Armistice of September 19, 1944, two high-ranking officers in the Operational department of Finnish Military HQ, Colonel Valo Nihtilä and Lieutenant Colonel Usko Haahti, started planning countermeasures against a possible Soviet occupation of the country. They came up with the idea of decentralized storage of light infantry weapons, **so that in case of occupation, an immediate guerrilla war could be launched**.
&gt; 
&gt; During the demobilization, an organization responsible for hiding the equipment was created and war materiel and other supplies were given to them for safekeeping. A total of 5,000–10,000 people participated in the operation. It was planned that they would cache supplies for 8,000 men, but the participants worked so eagerly that it is supposed they hid enough for 35,000 soldiers.[citation needed]",Finland,/r/europe/comments/9cu2it/number_of_guns_per_inhabitant_in_europe/e5dmspx/,onkko,1536072853

It's also true that 80% want the issue solved through a referendum, but it's like that because the statute was rejected and people started calling for Catalonia to break away so they could decide their own finances and be autonomous with the central government intervening. If they get greater autonomy then that issue gets solved.

&gt; It's not like allowing a region to vote on independence is something never seen. UK, Canada

A couple of things here. Spain won't allow it due to their constitution. In the case of the UK, Cameron allowed it because he thought it would fail. It could have been his blunder too since he never defined the terms, but he was confident that it was going to fail which it did. He tried to the same thing with Brexit and it backfired because he never set the terms for what it meant for citizens of the UK to want to leave because he thought it was going to fail. 

Let me illustrate what that means. He could have said that a simple majority with a certain percentage of the vote means that society is divided, but people are hurting so he'll renegotiate some terms with the EU. He could have added on that an unquestionable grand majority with a sizeable portion of the voting age population means that people definitely are fed up with the EU and so the UK must leave. 

The same level of care taken to updating constitutions should have been given to Brexit and the Scottish referendum. The Brexit and the Scottish referendums were not simple decisions and they shouldn't have been taken lightly.  

Canada was the same way only they didn't approach it the same way, Cameron did. They didn't actually have a plan for what would happen if Quebec broke away because they weren't going to let it happen. The Clarity Act makes it virtually impossible. The way it is set up means you can't declare yourself independent with 51% of the vote and 57% of the voting age population since the government won't consider it a grand consensus.

I need a citation on that. that doesn't even remotely make sense to me.

&gt;That's the end game of regulation, the end of self-defence

the end game of regulation in the united states should be closing loopholes and making rules that make more sense.. personally, i like the belgian 3 month waiting period to prevent impulsive purchase, i like the polish rule that you have to have a psych eval (i believe yearly) to continue to keep your firearm.  i don't ever forsee guns going away or getting fully locked away in this country, it'd just be nice if we could treat the regulation of them like they're intended to kill people.  

the thing i don't get, people keep saying ""it's mental health, it's mental health"". so why don't we make a national registry, make longer waiting periods to prevent impulsive purchase, make bullets harder to get, just get rid of guns shows and private sale loopholes, why don't we require yearly psych evals?  why don't we have inspectors come out to a licensed gun owners house to insure that guns are stored in a locked cabinet when the gun owner has kids?  why are we so allergic to regulating something that is used to kill people?  we regulate the shit out of cars because they kill people, and they have purposes other than killing.  regulating cars didn't mean nobody got cars and it doesn't mean that people stopped being killed by them.  people just get killed less.",,/r/europe/comments/9cu2it/number_of_guns_per_inhabitant_in_europe/e5dfr90/,sujihiki,1536065437

sooo you saying this

...Pretty much applies to anyone breaking the law. And now tell me why the neo nazis don't riot everytime anyone (german or immigrant) kills a guy in Germany? The answer is simple because the AfD is using this just to promote and scaremonger like SA did before ww2. Its practically the same sh't and you should know your own countries history since you live In germany.

If the immigrants should be deported before they commit a crime then also Germans who would commit or commited a crime should be deported too. But obviously you wouldn't agree because you just care about yourself.

But deport the nazis then as well. As you have seen they are also violent by burning down cars and beating up people in these riots.

The English and Welsh have always been ambivalent about the EU, and negotiated to get what they want, without considering the notion of developing the eurospace as a whole, drawing in people from all part of the EU to a more prosperous life, with improved safety, health, and futures for their kids. 

This is beyond the English and Welsh mindset. Thatcher took the lid off the pressure cooker when she declared ""look after number one"" (i paraphrase) and two nations in the UK took her at her word and did precisely that.

The reason the Scots and NI folk voted remain is a matter of social evolution, pragmatism, and yes, a degree of selflessness. We understand the notion of working together in a big community to benefit all, expand our life experiences by interaction with our fellow Europeans, including us living in their communities, and they in ours. We also understand the need for freedom of movement. It's common sense. A country at the beginning of their new road will have a travelling population who will seek opportunities in the EU, improve their skills and human interaction, and take those important experiences back to their own country. Poland's a great example of this. It was tough going for them when they first joined the EU, with a lot of the insidious soviet mentality afflicting systems and politics, no matter how hard they tried. But they got their act together, and those polish folk returning home in ever larger numbers are helping their country to improve and evolve, both financially and in their societies. You could have an argument against the current government who seem hell bent on reversing some the democratic gains, but the Polish people are more than willing to defend their democracy, and do so regularly. Their glowing GDP numbers and improvements in lifestyle and social protection are a testament to the 4 pillars of the EU. 
And likewise. Us Scots have a proud history of going out into the world and meeting new folk. We're good at it in the main, and don't carry the arrogance of assuming everyone must be like us, or they're ""not worthy.""

Like any new system, and let's not forget the EU is less than 100 years old, prosperous mature societies often take a lot longer to iron out most of the problems and mature, as each generation is born into and grows up within that society. It will take more time to settle into a solid balance and old arguments and conflicts fade into history. Getting rid of political populists would be a good step in this direction, but then it wouldn't be democratic to ban them would it.

England in particular doesn't have this more altruistic mindset, generally. Nor are they pragmatic enough to filter out the nonsense, and focus on facts and economic reality. That's why the relentless EU bashing in the redtop media gains a foothold, and plants the lies and mistruths in the general populations heads so successfully. Tell a lie often enough and it becomes truth. A deceit as old as time. The ""island"" mentality of englanders holds them back from evolving into more open minded folk, generally.
Brussels hasn't taken away sovereignty from anyone. The EU commission, made up of all member states, is proof of that. It's the EU commission that debates and introduces policy and bills to present to the democratically elected representatives of the people of the EU, the EU parliament. And they in turn debate the introduced bills, and either vote for or against. It's as normal a democratic structure as most others, not an empire waiting to rule over all. There have been plenty of bills introduced by the commission that have been dumped in the bin. 

Let's turn to Westminster.

The political system in the EU is based on a fair allocation of seats in the parliament. Different parties forge and break temporary alliances based on the wishes of their constituents, and representatives from interested parties. Not all of these are based on being good for the people, but the EU parliament has a pretty good record of holding the line against massive lobbied interests who are, let's be honest, in it for the money and fuck the interests of the people. This is a global phenomenon and certainly not one confined to the EU. The occasional one sneaks through, and is reviewed by a cross party/nation committee who can them send the bill back for further consideration. Most importantly, the people of the EU know they can assemble and protest, and have done so without fear of the EU sending in the troops to wipe them all out for daring to speak up.
Westminster is run by oligarchs through their representatives who face no such extra perusal. The house of lords does its best, but they have relatively little power, and worse, both major parties have granted many lordships and ladyships based on political considerations. In an ideal world, the house of lords would include a healthy percentage of technocrats, and people skilled in other walks of life, who could then give an even broader perspective on legislation.
Westminster is what it always has been. A show. The establishment and their friends keep a firm grip on proceedings, and guide the legislative journey through political reptiles like May, Johnson, Gove, Fox, Corbyn, Blair and so on. No party is immune to this, although those smaller parties seem to actually take the notion of democratic process and representing the people more seriously.
So I agree with you about the ""silent majority"", although i would add it's a lot worse than you think. 

This is the same group that embraced Thatcher's call of ""look after number one"" in spades, and are the same group that would be happy to see the ""unwashed general public"" excluded from free healthcare, social benefits, and so on. This is the same group that despises immigrants of any flavour, and would happily see them all gone, taking the unwashed general public with them.

A nice clean island for the few, without the unpleasant experience of dealing with others in different circumstances to themselves.

This is the real england and wales, and the real reason why brexit happened. It will never change as, in their relative comfort, they have no wish to evolve beyond their fought for status quo and imaginary elevated status. If there were a second referendum that fell solidly on the side of remain, they would agitate and extort for extreme compensation for the ""loss of their rights"". And the Tories would give it to them, because they are one and the same. Extremely selfish and self-absorbed to the exclusion of all else. 

Those in poorer areas of England, the english equivalent of ""untouchables"" fell into the trap neatly as it's there, in the villages and towns, where the establishment sent the immigrants, knowing it would foment distrust and conflict, and give them even more reason for implementing their longed for Social Apartheid.
The UK and EU will never have a reasonable relationship. A UK led by the establishment is lacking any sort of vision for change or positive social evolution. It's not in their DNA. They will continue to pine for empire 2.0, where countries were occupied and forced to their knees in subservience to the establishment for all time, or until the ""unwashed public"" take matters into their own hands, and stop voting for establishment shills. They will never stop demanding more than they deserve, simply because they believe they deserve it.

UK membership in the EU has been a bright spot in UK history, and many have benefited from it, whatever the predominately english naysayers and media say.
The EU did not impose austerity on the people of the UK. The Tories did that. The problems in scarcity of funds comes not from the amount the UK pays into the EU (and the government gets nearly all of that back with the rules unique to the UK), but the lack of funds doled out to the councils from Westminster. So it's not the EU that is making the life of the average briton difficult, quite the opposite. The EU has been generous in providing funds for all sort of infrastructure projects in all the nations in the UK, where Westminster would not do so. 

Scotland and NI need to agitate NOW for independence referendums. Things have changed rapidly from the last one, and both nations will suffer under a Westminster government free of the shackles of human rights, workers rights, and any other socially responsible and remotely compassionate rights.

The UK is posed to once against become a hard feudal society, even more so than it is now. Both major political parties are two sides of the same coin more or less representing the same masters, and financial opportunities.

The EU has already indicated they'll look at the situation for both Scotland and NI favourably in some sort of holding capacity, as the fine details of continued membership get sorted out. They also indicated the Republic of Ireland will get extra help if the people of NI take the decision to join with Eire once again.

Let the english and welsh have their brexit and bear the consequence of that decision. 
Let's get out of it as soon as possible.
And don't forget, if we Scots are in the EU, and the english want to rejoin, we can help the general public in England get a much better deal as we ponder the value of letting them back in, or not, as equal members in the European Union.
Ironic.

Lithuania can set their own rules for local content - or not if they don't see the use in it. That is an option on the national level.

Over the fifteen years of increased Chinese activity in the region, African governments are well aware of Chinese interests and have refined their negotiating tactics to better advance development objectives. Despite criticism that Chinese firms heavily depend on Chinese labor, for example, most infrastructure projects are completed primarily by African workers, with Chinese nationals in management or technical positions. A comprehensive 2017 McKinsey report on Sino-African economic relations reported that Africans comprised 89 percent of labor on the projects surveyed.

I prefer if issues are settled by who has the better arguments, not who's better in waving a gun.

So, no, I don't think this is a good idea at all. We don't need gunslingers but smart people in power.

Also, while I hear this kind of argument once in a while when it comes to gun politics with US citizens involved, I find it very hypothetic.

I mean, have you heard of or witnessed any situation where a dispute has been settled like this, by an arms race between citizens? I doubt it's a common case. And if you did, do you think it was the best way to solve the situation?

The ""Tagesthemen"" news show had to admit a mistake in reporting on the rallies in Chemnitz on Saturday. The editorial team mistakenly used pictures from the Chemnitz protests on Monday.

Hardly any topic is currently discussed more hotly than the recurrent demonstrations and rallies of the right and their counter-demonstrators in the Saxon town of Chemnitz. The minds are heated on all sides, every media report has great relevance. All the more striking is when the media - as in this case - makes a mistake.

The program ""Tagesthemen"" reported on Saturday about the Saturday demonstrations in Chemnitz and also showed a video that was already uploaded to YouTube last Monday. The clip included radical hooligans - fans of Lokomotive Leipzig football club. They were filmed as they chanted right-wing slogans. The comment in the report read: ""Some participants of the turn are openly right-wing extremists.""

In the Sunday broadcast, spokeswoman Caren Miosga stated that it was a mistake: ""When reporting on the rallies in Chemnitz in the 'Tagesthemen' yesterday, we also mistakenly used pictures from the demonstration last Monday, without making it clear , We apologize for any inconvenience.""

The explosiveness of the false reporting lies in the fact that every media contribution is scrutinized by the other party. Right-wing groups often make use of such mistakes in order to accuse the press of lying, further fueling popular sentiment.",,/r/europe/comments/9ctwff/false_images_used_tagesthemen_das_erste_major/e5d7tjm/,blackstonebite,1536051583

2335,"Alright, statistics isnt that simple. You cant just pull out those numbers without sources AND interpret them like they are all self-explanatory.

[According to the german Police](https://www.bka.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/PolizeilicheKriminalstatistik/2017/Standardtabellen/Tatverdaechtige/STD-TV-07-T29-Tatort-Wohnsitz-TV-nichtdeutsch_excel.xlsx) 43% Of all **suspects** of homicide were foreign.

[According to the german office of statistics](https://www.destatis.de/DE/ZahlenFakten/GesellschaftStaat/Rechtspflege/Tabellen]/AuslaendischeVerurteilte.html) the percentage of convicts was 31% foreigners.

Now there still is a 3:1 overrepresentation, as you said. But when interpreting statistics it's extremely hard to account for all biases. For example, generally the percentage of homicides is in favor for men as well. It just so happens, that the majority of refugees are men. There is also the factor of age, whether they live in big citys or in more rural places, etc...

There are a lot of other factors that could increase this number that don't support the ""foreigners are all more violent"" thesis.

[There might even be evidence, that foreigners living in germany are less criminal than peers in their social class.](http://www.uni-siegen.de/phil/sozialwissenschaften/soziologie/mitarbeiter/geissler/ueberblick_1_08.pdf)

Because... they all work with BMW. That's the first. Now, to say that VW and Daimler knew, but BMW didn't, is a bit far fetched, even you have to admit. 
Now, onto the next episode... which your prosecutors don't know because it's not in Germany (or i am not aware, but i could be wrong, off course)... you know how people get coupons when they turn in their old cars to be recycled and depending on what new car they are going to buy, but to be more precise, if CO2 emissions are less than 100 g/kg, they get more money from the government when they go to a dealer and buy that new car? If say, an auto producer were to state that the car CO2 Emissions are less than 100 g/km on tests when in fact they are not while function normally... well i'm not going to get into the whole legal implications... but it involves at least 5 penal offenses. As i was saying, i have it on very good authority that various governments in the EU and outside the EU are investigating this matter. So you see dear adult, it's not something your prosecutors know, unless they are investigating it themselves. But you're not going to find out until the investigation is completed.

2423,"&gt;  but I don't think Jews were implicated in frequent terrorist attacks

The Nazis and the far-right back then blamed the communist and separatist terrorist attacks and street violence on Jews because most of the leaders of such movements were Jews. They also blamed the Jews for killing millions of Christians in Russia, which they still do if you visit any far-right subreddit.

&gt;nor did they have backwards values for their time

According to Nazi propaganda the Jews were looking to rape German women to defile their blood, and ""import blacks"" from Africa to Germany to destroy Germany. The Nazis also had reporters stationed at courts who would regularly report exclusively on Jewish defendants and criminals.

&gt;They were a fairly well-integrated, educated, well-behaved minority that was targeted for being the wrong religion and being caught up the race mania of the early 20th century.

You say that now, but the Jews were portrayed just as the Muslims are now, with the criminals that happened to be Jewish, and the terrorists that happened to be Jewish, being portrayed as representative of the ""degeneracy"" and ""destructive nature"" of Judaism.",,/r/europe/comments/9cl0j8/photos_emerge_of_an_armed_radical_right/e5d01mn/,Wolphoenix,1536037013

Jews were frequently blamed for communism, and there were communist terrorist attacks. Sometimes attackers were ethnic Jews.

Of course minority of Jews actually supported communism - but it's the same here, small minority of Muslims support Islamist terrorism (at least things like ISIS, Paris attacks etc. - support for anti-Israeli terrorism is actually high among Muslims).

&gt; nor did they have backwards values for their time, nor were they well overrepresented in crime, nor did they have the sheer numbers and worrying demographic forecasts

Unfortunatelly, all these partly checked in case of Eastern European Jews. Orthodox ones (who made a majority there) were conservative (although this wasn't really an issue then), and they had higher birthrates. And Jewish mob was a thing in some cities, e.g. Warsaw or Łódź. Of course average Jew was law-abiding, and well-behaving... just like an average European Muslim now.

###'Main organiser' of Paris terror attack 'recruited a team' from migrants in Hungary who had refused to register with authorities, government official reveals

They were not passing through though. They were there for days waiting for Abdeslam to pick them up. And the police (Orbán) ordered migrants to stay in Keleti station. Fun fact: Keleti means eastern. It usually does not have trains towards Austria. Austria is to the west. 

&gt; Irrelevant.

We are Hungary. We voted twice about **not** accepting immigrants. Orbán then went on and accepted immigrants. Your idol that is.

2517,"The interesting bit of the backstory is that in the two decades leading up to the current refugee crisis, German policy was to grant asylum to only a minority and grant a tolerated status to the rest. The political reason for this was to keep the number of accepted refugees low (after a popular backlash to the refugees from the Yugoslav wars.) 

Many people who got a tolerated status would've been granted full refugee status in other countries, and the only reason they didn't get one in Germany is that it was argued they had effectively the same rights as full refugees with the tolerated status. I read a breakdown a couple of years ago and I think before this crisis, roughly 90% of tolerated asylum seekers had a right to stay, while 10% were tolerated because they couldn't be deported for one reason or another (because their case was contested in court, because they lacked ID documents, because their home country refused to take them etc.) 

I suspect that cases of people who should actually be deported not getting deported may be an echo of that policy. ",Europe,/r/europe/comments/9cnuh3/thousands_of_people_demonstrating_in_chemnitz/e5ctx4g/,hanikamiya,1536029716

Yes, that is very unreasonable. If the murder rate goes up, then you might have a problem, but if the number of murders go up but the rate stays the same, then literally nothing has changed, you've just got a growing population. 

I don't know which it is, people can be very quick to pin a rising crime rate on a rising immigration rate when that's not necessarily the case, but it also makes sense for a group with a vastly different cultural background and poverty level to commit crimes at a higher rate than normal citizens.

It wasn't, yet putting backing such lowlifes was planned, as well as backing KSA or supporting scum or using divisions was pretty much intentional.

&gt; No, the neo-cons really do [believe their own garbage](https://www.amazon.com/End-History-Last-Man/dp/0743284550).

Yes, I'm sure they also believed in mass destruction weapons. I'm sure many naïve bunch also believes in that they were spreading democracy, but I'm not sure how that's relevant. Both the real intention wasn't that, nor it cancels the responsibility. Let's not pretend that all have been done since the WWI or WWII was with some good intent.

&gt; Actually mass shooters in the USA tend to be either a) black thugs or b) nihilistic white/asian teenagers from liberal homes. I wouldn't say there's a ""conservative"" or ""NRA"" shooting problem, just a general lack of pragmatism on the issue of guns.

There is a structural problem which many conservatives are the main cause with their stupid agenda. So, I can see American conservatism there.

&gt; This is getting to be a pretty boring conversation. I'm not gonna admit that we need to ban ""conservatism"".

Why mate? If you can ban Muslims for some Muslims, I'm sure you can ban conservatives with the same logic. Actually, when it comes to mass bombings or mass murders, the folks did those were again conservatives of many kinds. 

&gt; Deluded as you are, even you must realize that the next mass murder or sexual assault in Europe ain't gonna be commuted by a ""conservative"".

Highly probably will, for the next murder. Rather by a Christian one or a Muslim one. Sexual assaults, not sure but sure that both conservative Muslims and conservative Christians are more prone to such acts. Of course, we can give a go to conservative Catholic clergy as well, who knows? 

&gt; If you've got nothing more to add then let's call it a day here.

2802,"&gt;But these were clearly defined parts based on whatever sick criteria they preferred to implement it first. Of course widening the criteria is very possible in the alternative reality, but it's still something we are entirely guessing.

Are we really guessing if we have records of their plans? Plans that were in part already implemented?

&gt;Who, Stalin? What's the point of that argument?

That even though he was in power for so long he still killed less than the Nazis did in only 12 years.

&gt;And again, this is an insane amount of guessing. I just don't see a reason to fall into that pit.

Again, we have their plans. We can make a safe assumption of what would've happened.

&gt;You really shouldn't... Germany just invaded another foreign country, just like the USSR did with many other countries. They played the same game and in the relation between them, this shouldn't be counted as a ""point for the Germans"".

The invasion of Poland was also just an invasion of another country. Same for every other country they invaded. I mean should we just count those killed in Nazi Germany itself, in its 1937 borders? I doubt you'd agree with that. 

Ultimately the Germans had a clear plan to exterminate most Soviets, and while they didn't achieve that or even put into full swing they killed millions of Soviet civilians. Many of them, if not most, were killed directly by the Germans. They should certainly be counted. 

&gt;Different timespan is an argument, for sure, but I don't see the reason to overemphasize it either.

Back in the day, the dominant divisions in parliament were mostly about economic reforms and voting rights, with liberals, conservatives and social-democrats being the major players.

2804,"I am amazed how every time you post you twist what I say into in something else. Nothing what you said even expands on the point I fielded but opens up different avenues that I never talked about.

When a parent is always there everytime ('what can I do for you? No I am sure there is SOMETHING' - helicopter parents on crack and speed and whatever.). Starts by bringing school lunch, over popping their head through the door 'do you need something' - no matter if alone or with friends or partner, to in the end suffocating every attempt of their kid do something independent on their own. Ruining anything their kid tries to do and any relationship the kid has by not giving the kid even the slightest bit of personal space. And not to learn anything by getting told from different sides - including the kid intself. To the point of the kid studying abroad just to get away from his parents and later even cutting ties.

Because of their conviction 'to give everything for the child'.

Yeah. A case of parents absolutely committed to self-sacrifice for the kid - albeit in the end neither necessary nor to the benefit of the kid. Those were horrible parents no kid deserves - one of many kinds no kid deserves. They were no 'heroes' - no matter how well they meant. 

I **never** talked about the parents giving everything **necessary** **up to the point of self sacrifice**. That is just you re-interpreting whatever the fuck you want into what I said. 

To go back to what started this

&gt;But generally speaking a good competent parent, **will** sacrifice himself for his children.

While I denied that statement and said:

&gt;Having the conviction to potentially sacrifice oneself **when necessary** is what makes a good parent.

2903,"well, not really. Merkel made that announcement to not deport back to the nation of first EU-entry according to Dublin when hundret of thousand refugees just borke through the border of Hungary and Orban called Austria with the information that the refugees were comming. This caused Austria to call Germany with the request to help, which Germany did. It was also in the best interest of Germany at that point, because there was no possibility to prevent these people getting in. If Germany made official that they deport, the refugees would have entered germany nontheless, but would have got into the underground immidialty, creating a situation where hundret of thousand people would have created a new illegal underground over night that could only sustain itself via crime and illegal labour.

So, if you go back in history, the refugees were in Hungary, before that all over the Balkan, before that in Greece. At that time, Germany still had a hard stance on Dublin, pushing the problem, just as any other central nation, on the border nations, and the refugee movement towards the balkan only broke when the greek refugee centers were in a humanitarian crisis during which people died of dehydration because the greek government couldn't cope with the situation.

The earliest records of the Huns (from their enemies) also describe them as an Asiatic people who held slaves among their armies (Goths for instance).

I can imagine it would feel unjust to him. However, let's not forget,  anything less would feel unjust to the victim's family. His actions created an injustice whether he had impulse control or not, and that injustice cannot be taken away. It is going to haunt someone. Seems more proper to have it haunt the murderer rather than the victim, and as an added bonus ensure he will never harm anyone again.

Yugoslavia was part of the US support to Europe in the 1949-1953 timeframe. The reason you don't know that is because it wasn't part of the Marshall Plan but a separate later agreement that was the consequence of the 1948 split. Turning either a blind eye to that or not progressing further on Wikipedia than the first paragraph doesn't change facts.

 As already mentioned, a vast number of infrastructure in Croatia right now was partially financed through the EU pre-accession funds and other frameworks. Croatia isn't ""by itself"", Croatia is just an incompetent nation state.

Foreign governmental financial support for Croatia was significant. It had access to so many frameworks that nations not in Europe did not have and so many other international frameworks that only came into being in the 90s. It is just that you are too stupid to realise that a lot of it ended in someone's pocket rather than in your household budget.",,/r/europe/comments/9cj280/percentage_of_people_who_tend_to_agree_with_the/e5bst7f/,ivarokosbitch,1535993650

What you said is inaccurate because Stalin invaded Estonia based on his agreement with Nazi Germany (Molotov-Ribbentrop pact). Finland was also in a Soviet sphere of interests (like Estonia).

Meanwhile in Ukraine exchange rate went from 8uah to the dollar to 28uah and still falling...

Did you know nobody moved when Turkish Cypriots were getting killed because of Greek coup and Cypriot government? Did you know Bulgarian government didn't allowed Turks to come Turkey if they refuse to give their homes, animal and other belongings to Bulgaria? 

Where do i know this? My father's family came from Dobriç (some born in Bulgaria and some in Romania because of agreements), they had home there but taken from them but nobody talk  about it?

On paper, plenty. Allegedly, quality of life grew, infrastructure got better... but it is lilely that all of this happened in Bucharest or very specific places.

Beyond the Capital, pretty much nothing changed really. Highways continue to be built at a snails' pace (if not slower), CFR keeps being slow, the politicians are still corrupt as shit, and many irregularities and administrative inefficiencies keep plaguing us. Sure, you have stuff like the Alba Carolina citadel, which was renovated with EU funds but even then, it could have been better.

Do I still have confidence in the EU? Never had any. Do I still have confidence in my national government? Not under its current leadership. In the right hands, we could manage to fix most of our major problems while remaining true to ourselves and preserving that which makes us unique; but given our current leadership... we would require a drastic change; something the EU may not agree with, in some respects.

Your total ignorance of the UK is showing here. Of course adult children stay with their parents. Of course parents cook meals for their children. Of course parents send money to their children. Of course parents look after the grandchildren- most are rasied by grandparents now because the adult children are working every second of every day to make ends meat for said children.

They're a direct threat, and regardless of what people on here say it seems pretty clear that Eastern European tradesmen did drive down wages in various trades. I remember my parents being giddy at finding a Polish plumber that would charge half what our normal one would. 

For reference, one of my friends dads at school was a plumber and they had a holiday home in Florida. That was a reality for plumbers at one point..

Anyway, I'm rambling. 

Basically, eastern europeans are a direct threat in that they're so similar. 

Asians and Africans, not so much. Asians are often small business owners (shops, takeaways, etc) or in sectors that need a high level of education like Doctors, engineers, etc. There's no direct competition there.

She remained pagan all her life, even after the conversion. 

After the conversion the progress of change was very, very slow. Firstly, there was simply not enough churches or priests. People outside cities were often left to their own devices and practiced old religion openly. There are letters to Vatican from local priests complaining about open tree, snake and other worshipping outside cities, there was still big shortage of priests. The practice of paganism lasted to as late as 18th century. There were no mass witch trials to speak of for variety of reasons (mainly for the reason that you'd have to persecute majority of population of in keeping with western European standards) and the church took a practical approach treating such worships not as heresy, but superstition.

""The system has to change allthough not in a way PiS is doing it. One thing people don't know outside of Poland is that 3 division of power in our constitution is super Montesqiuan with hordly any supervision mechanism between them not really seen elswhere. What it results in is that judiciary is devoid of any supervision or control accept its own insider thing. If the judge or procecutor is lazy ineffective or an asshole, all he has to fear is ""colleague court "" . What the result is that in impossible number of cases processes they would take years to judge a simple stuff. Actually majority of rulings of European Court of Justice against Poland was due to lenght of court procedings. Why the constitution sets it like that? It was implemented in 1997 and written on the recomendations of people from former Solidarity movement who experianced great injustice from legal system in commie times and had this silly idea that the whole problems come from too much power in the goverment hands and so on. As we have seen it's not only the case. The idea is to put some supervision on courts where lazy or evil judge can be punished because the ""colleague ""thing doesn't work. Problem is that the government is going too far with this plus theycannot do it without breaking the constitution. This is simply why none previous governments tried to change it. We knew we have a problem for many years now""



To add to this, polish people are supporting government even though they see risk because they have two choices, either stay with system that we know sucks for many years or take a risk and possibly(but unlikely) improve the situation, even if nothing changes for better polish people believe they will send message to judges that polish people wont tolerate what they are doing and if they do BS like this again, they will vote for someone who WILL replace them.

Also polish people are also supporting government with the changes because they are afraid what it would mean if this change fails, it would mean that juidicary in Poland is unreformable, which is pretty scary knowing that there is a ""caste"" in Poland that has huge impact on what is happening in Poland and who cant be touched if they do something bad. Whats more if change fails it may actually empower judges to do more BS knowing they cant be replaced...

Svenska Dagbladet [one of two major swedish national broadsheets] wrote an opinion piece **2008, noting that 96% lack passports**

&gt;The much written of case in Uppsala ... raises many questions about society's control functions. An interesting detail is that charges have not yet been brought against the man because the police can not determine his identity. According to Upsala Nya Tidning [a newspaper] the police investigates three different identities.

&gt;At the time of writing, the Uppsala man could be in principle anyone. He may be a criminal on the run from the law in any other European country. Or a luck seeker in Sweden to milk the social insurance system. Or, of course, he may be a refugee seeking protection from the violent repression of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

&gt;...

&gt;To emphasize the difficult situation that the decision-makers at the Migration Board have to deal with can be mentioned that **only four percent of those who applied for asylum in Sweden in 2008 showed valid passports at the time of application**.

&gt;...

&gt;It's hard to believe that all these asylum seekers lost their identity documents in civil war or natural disasters. A more reasonable assumption is that behavior has been adapted to the specifically Swedish and probably benevolent migration system, which made it easier to gain access to the country as paperless than with the help of their CV [resume].

The other major national broadsheet Dagens Nyheter wrote a news piece **2013 that 90% lack passports**.

&gt;When people come to Sweden and seek asylum, 90 percent lack passports. When they enter Schengen, the refugee-migrant-smuggler is taking care of the passports again,

In Norway, [Aftenposten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftenposten), **Norways largest newspaper wrote 2013, that 10% has valid travel documents**

&gt;In the past four years, 43,709 asylum seekers have come to Norway. About ten percent of these bring passports or other valid travel documents.

Ayaan Hirsi Ali noted in her book ""[Infidel](https://www.amazon.com/Infidel-Ayaan-Hirsi-Ali/dp/0743289692)"" that she lied 1992 on arriving along with lots of others.

&gt;*At the end of August, I got an official letter from the Dutch refugee office. My heart sank; this must be my letter of rejection. I would be sent to Canada, or to Nairobi—it amounted to the same thing. I didn't deserve refugee status; it was over. When Mina saw my face, I confessed to her that I had lied to the authorities. She shrugged and said she had lied, too; the camp was full of people with manufactured stories quaking that they would be thrown out.*

Quoted from **Swedish Government Bill 2003/04:50** (A parliamentary paper proposing legislation).

&gt;""Of those who sought asylum in Sweden in 2002, 88 per cent lacked passports.""

The Svenska Dagbladet broadsheet again Feb 2003 writes

&gt;**""Nine out of ten seek asylum without a passport""**

&gt;""Several important government initiatives are blocked by the fact that we have a very large influx of people without asylum grounds and in some groups 100 percent do not have ID documents,"" says Lisa Pelling, political expert at migration minister Jan O Karlsson.

&gt;...

&gt;Refugees from Iraq, Bulgaria, the former Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Somalia almost always lack ID documents.

&gt;The lack of passport makes it very complicated to enforce rejections,"" says Alicia Bengtsson.

**Swedish Parliamentary Protocol, December 1989**

&gt;""Most asylum seekers are completely missing travel documents"" - Erkki TAMMENOKSA(S).

&gt;Parliamentary Minutes 1989/90:46, Thursday, December 14, Kl. 9:00 to 23:10
&gt;http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Kammaren/Protokoll/Riksdagens-protokoll-1989904_GD0946/?html=true

The last sane moment in swedish immigration handling, the (in sweden) famous ""Lucia Decision"" had just been taken, putting a halt to immigration because of the numbers and the documentlessness of 'refugees'.
***

As early as 1989, the Swedish government tightened the law to counteract ""asylum abuse"" and ""documentlessness"".

&gt;**""Government letter 1989/90:68 on immigration and refugee policy""**

&gt;""The government has also taken action against the increasing abuse of the right to asylum. It is common for persons to seek asylum in Sweden invoking right to asylum despite the fact that the grounds for asylum are very weak. In the case of the individual case, it is often found that such asylum seekers significantly exaggerates their fears about returning to their home country. **The applicant does not rarely supply false documents and tells made up stories**. This has been established through country knowledge, the applicant's own data and investigations in the individual case. ""

&gt;**""This is an international problem and partly because asylum immigration is the only door open to people who want to leave their home countries for reasons other than being persecuted. This is part of the explanation for the so-called documentlessness, ie that asylum seekers come here without either identity or travel documents, although they obviously must have had such [travel documents] at the beginning of the trip. As the  asylum seekers lacks or withholds their documents, the investigations in the asylum cases are greatly complicated**. The processing times are extended and in many cases complicates or make impossible to expulsion to first asylum country.""

&gt;""In proposition 1988/89:86 with proposals for foreigner-legislation, etc., are proposals aimed at addressing the increasing problem of documentlessness. This includes incarceration for reasons of investigation and options for police and customs to investigate hand luggage and clothes. These parts of the bill have been suspended by the Riksdag according to Chapter 2, Section 12, third paragraph, of the Government Form. [Swedish 'constitution']""

&gt;""In autumn 1989, the UNHCR Executive Committee adopted recommendations aimed at rectifying the abuse of asylum rights through international and national measures. Therefore on November 2, 1989, the Government has declared in a single asylum case a sharpening in examining a documentless asylum seekers' reasons for obtaining a residence permit in Sweden. The sharpening means that a documentlessness which has a purpose to mislead shall result in reduced confidence in the alleged asylum grounds unless strong reasons is against such an assessment. ""

While we're very well aware of the big picture of the war and the importance of America, what happened locally has a very different level of meaning and having a random American come in and tell us what's what seems a bit tasteless.

Edit: It's also a sensitive issue because the failure of Operation Market Garden (partly due to various avoidable screwups in planning, partially due to bad luck) was a pretty significant blow to the Allied assault (leaving a large part of the Netherlands to suffer the [Hunger Winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_famine_of_1944%E2%80%9345)), and the finger pointing afterward was a particularly undignified part of WWII history (with command trying to push blame on the [Poles under Sosabowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Sosabowski#Battle_of_Arnhem), who by all accounts fought hard and well during Market Garden despite the Allies leaving their country to the Soviets and not allowing them to fight there).",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/9ccskx/dutch_resistance_members_celebrate_at_the_moment/e5b7v80/,rebootyourbrainstem,1535965151

A couple of enthusiasts from Romania came to march in support of a union between Romania and Moldova.

They probably thought that it would have been glorious, but either from lack of pre-planning or simply poor communication, they were pretty much the only ones that were present there.

People from Moldova just minded their own business and found about the event afterwards.

Now throughout the journey, they were at several points assaulted by special forces, which is not right.
 Everyone should be able to express their views freely. But the action was almost certainly agreed with the Romanian authorities beforehand. Moldova is quite dependent on Romania nowadays and such an intervention should have caused a reaponse had it not been discussed in advance. Since a member of Romania's PMP party was leading the crowd, I bet that the Moldovan-Romanian PD-PSD alliance took the opportunity to rough him up.

3635,"&gt; All I said is that a bank was clearly not designed to be an architectural attraction and that looking at a building that has no reason to spend money on aesthetics as evidence of modern architecture being a failure is ridiculous. 

As all other representative buildings, banks of course where greatly designed back then too. Surely you know that. I don't even have to pull up pictures, you can just google ""classical banl building"" or something. Where does your resoning it doesn't have to have aesthetics come from? In Germany at least and to some extent in Britain there are guidelines and groups advocating high quality architecture, it is even laid down in law and proven to have an impact on the quality of urban live. ""It doesn't have to have a modicum of appeal"" is the ridiculous statement for me.

&gt; Being in such a central and expensive location just means that there is even less room in the budget for aesthetics. 

I shouldn't argue with you anymore. Do you know how expensive a free hanging glass fassade is we see on so many modern buildings? 

&gt; because your only metric for the quality of a building's architecture is whether or not it looks suitably old. Being a bland and anonymous piece of garbage is OK - as long as it it's 'traditional'.

Ok. I guess you just go travel with all these people on urban holidays to the modernist cities. Those are extremely popular, right? I'll just go with my small bunch of reactionary traditionalists to shitholes like Paris, Copenhagen, London or Venice  :') Or maybe i'll spend time in the city of Munster, which was almost completely destroyed by WW2 but other than equally destroyed cities in Germany it was reconstructed including medieval small parcels and fassades.

&gt;It's debatable whether we should ever have allied with Turkey, but Japan is a no-brainer. 

It's good to have them as an ally but letting them build up a military while the people in power are gearing up to be Imperial Japan again isn't a good idea. They'll throw out the US as an ally the moment it becomes inconvenient for them just like Turkey, and we supported and aided Turkey up until that point. The people in power think Imperial Japan did nothing morally wrong, and the only thing bad that they did were tactical mistakes.

There are several territorial disputes from Japan. And there's hundreds of years of feudal values pushing them towards using a military option to take them. We wouldn't support them taking them any more than we support Turkey in Syria. We'll lose them as an ally, and they'll have a genocidal regime in power with a built up army. The combination of admiration for Imperial Japan and wanting to raise an army and commit to real warfare should be alarming to you.

Plus the general ''collectivisation'' and ''making everything the same across the board'', which also affected shops and cafeterias and everything else in government owned institutions (none of the restaurants of cafeterias were private, they were all owned by the government, so they made food according to strict regulations)

Given their sexual nature some adults decided they shouldn't be erotically exposed in movies and TV (part of a general desire limit childhood exposure to eroticism - something all cultures seem to want to do). 

But of course profit motives drive directors to want to show breasts, so they push the limits.  They show a little cleavage, then more cleavage. How do you define a limit of how much cleavage can be shown? Or how much side-boob.  Nipples, on the other hand, are pretty clearly defined by an abrupt change in color.

3778,"I'm rezzing this thread since I've been thinking about some of the things said in this particular part of the thread regarding regional involvement in the Carlist Wars and Lupine's comment about how people want a good guy vs bad guy story. I also read English speaking newspapers and I think most journalists get it wrong because they're looking for clicks. So they only report on issues when they happen and say that things have always been that way in Spain.

I've also wanted to understand the origins of the movements that we see today. I've always been interested in where Basque and Catalan separatism came from and why it never took off in other regions like the other Catalan speaking regions, Galicia where it would seem obvious since language is a big component of the former two. But also other places in Spain too such as Navarra, Andalusia, Aragon, and Asturias which also could have historical and linguistical reasons for wanting to claim their different. Until I read this thread, I didn't really know much about Basque nationalism so thanks Metro for sharing the info you did. 

But yeah......I've been talking to some friends and people that I meet on the streets about the issue. A lot of them, as Lupine said, a lot of people only read into the issue up until a certain point or they don't really seem to care and will say ""oh it's really complicated, they've always wanted that"" when I try to get more into the roots. 

Super hardcore separatists will also say that to make it seem like it's been an eternal conflict about nationalist. 

But, from what I've read, seen, and heard, it doesn't seem that complicated and I think it's inaccurate to say that it's always been that way in Spain.

Certainly, Spain has a messy history and the 19th century was a mess as the country tried to figure out how to reorganize itself.  I wouldn't even characterize the Carlist Wars as a nationalistic struggle the way some people do. It really seems as if Basque nationalism starts at the end of the 19th century. However, I don't think know much about it during the first half of the 20th century except that Basque industrialist usually were on the side of Madrid and also that the Nationalist following the war were very repressive in the Basque region especially.  Some of Franco's most embarrassing international incidences occurred from events happening there. 

If I'm reading the history correctly, it seems as if other movements inside the Basque region were willing to join up with the Nationalist, but decided against it when they told them that they weren't going to have their fueros. 

After the 60s, it really seems to take on its modern form as ETA evolves from being a joint Basque and working-class movement to simply being a militant Basque separatist movement. During the 80s,90s, and 2000s PNV was pretty instrumental in helping to end their activities while also securing a tax agreement, their fueros, with the government.  

When it comes to Catalan nationalism, it really appears as if people confuse ""Catalanism"" with ""Catalan nationalism"". It seems Catalan industrialist in the 19th century have always been promoters of Catalan culture and language. Their vision was to make Barcelona, the Paris of Spain. Like the Basque industrialist, they too took the side of Madrid, since working class people in Catalonia were anarchist, and I believe this region of Spain contained the largest amount in Europe and were responsible for some terrorist attacks. So the industrialist feared anarchist overturning the capitalist order in Catalonia. 

With the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, there's a shift as he bans Catalalism when the industrialist hoped he would promote their interest. It's during this time period that Catalanism turns into  Catalan nationalism. The ERC  is founded during this period which promoted the idea of an independent Catalonia. In this era, that Catalonia was inside a federal Spain. It's something that a lot of anarchist and industrialist got behind although many of the latter did support the Nationalist.

In their efforts to address regional suppression during the Franco era, the writers during the transition declare certain parts of Spain as ""historic nationalities"". I think this is the powder keg which the current crisis spawns from. Something that was once a regional region inside Spain is institutionalized in the constitution and is used as a flashpoint. With that comes regional media and education which also promote the idea. I think this is the beginning of the current era of Catalan nationalism.

(Also in my mind, the problem about Spains reorganization issue which started in the 19th century was only halfway answered during this period. I don't think anyone can be faulted for not wanting to try something new after everything that had happened. Had Spain been more industrialized and more socially mobile for the poor and working classes then various factions wouldn't have spawned in the 19th and 20th century . Spain could have successfully reorganized itself without the government collapsing during either Republic era or following the first constitutional monarchy and these issues probably wouldn't exist.)

Fast forward to the mid to late 2000s and Catalan nationalism is a fringe issue. The mainstream parties promote and pass a package they later send to Madrid regarding finances and being a nationality. The latter idea coming from the constitution which is then put at conflict with the idea of the country being indivisible.  The supreme court, under PP votes it down, the keg goes off, and separatist parties come to power. It doesn't help that the crisis started during this time period in which Madrid has to enact austerity measures which are further used for political purposes.  

Did I hit the major points or am I missing something?

It's always interesting to me that none of this ever happened in Galicia, Valencia, or the Balearic Islands. Does anyone know why it's been that way?

It's just the cultural weight of the US and UK. 

If Spain had the same cultural weight, we would be refreshing our knowledge of Spanish passively and that would make the learning process in school effective enough to the point where most people would have strong bases in Spanish, without any change in the quality of education.   
Therefore, the fact that most people who mostly listen to music in English, watch English video makers or in general are on websites in English have strong bases in English isn't a good enough proof to say ""these people have higher education than British people who only speak one language"", we don't have any data showing that this difference in the number of languages spoken by the general population is related to a difference in the quality of education and can't be explained solely by the difference in weight of culture in a different language.",Aquitaine (France),/r/europe/comments/9brr4l/too_soon_too_harsh/e5aosnv/,Thelk641,1535937682

&gt;Loans are aid.  
&gt;

Loans are loans and need to be repaid.  Aid is a blanket term that includes grants, gifts, and other funds that don't require repayment.  Aid may also include loans, but characterizing the money given to the private banks by European governments to cover unplayable Greek debts as ""aid"" to Greece is misleading.  Governments provide financial aid that doesn't require repayment all the time.  

&gt;They bought Greek bonds which the Greek government sold. It's not like the banks sent loan applications to the Greek government. 
&gt;

Are you implying that banks are somehow obligated to buy any countries bonds just because?  The banks leant money to Greece at a specific interest rate which of course carried risk.  If Greece couldn't repay (which they couldn't), they would default on the loan and the banks would lose the money and nobody would lend to Greece. That's what should have happened.

&gt;It's a mistake to choose to blame one side or the other. The Greeks were irresponsible and reckless. The EU's response to the crisis was also irresponsible and reckless. 
&gt;

For every irresponsible borrower is an irresponsible lender.  Greece fucked up, but the punishment imposed by the EU made things much much worse and the banks who were just as irresponsible as Greece got away with murder.  Greece paid the biggest price here with generations of debt-slavery while European tax payers also got screwed by having to take on Greece's still unpayable debts.  I only assign blame where I think it is due, and in this case,  there's plenty to go around.

3938,"&gt;It was worse in Larger towns, as in the months after the liberation, people working together with the Nazi's (NSB'ers), Where punished. Often publicly shamed. If it was known that you worked for the Nazi's, or affiliated with them, it wasn't uncommon to be tied up and put on the steering wheel of a bike (How dutch of us), Or for the woman to have their head shaven, sometimes leaving only a swastika patch of hair.

And often only the people _suspected_ of working with Nazis. [In France thousands of women were punished](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration_horizontale) because they allegedly had sexual contacts with Nazis or were otherwise ""working for them"". Sometimes it was enough to work for them as a cleaner.

[An article about it.](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/05/women-victims-d-day-landings-second-world-war) There are a lot of deep themes about revenge and sexuality about all this. 

&gt;The basically misogynistic reaction of head-shaving during the liberation of France was repeated in Belgium, Italy and Norway and, to a lesser extent, in the Netherlands. In France, another wave of head-shaving took place in the late spring of 1945 when forced labourers, prisoners of war and concentration camp victims returned from Germany. Revenge on women represented a form of expiation for the frustrations and sense of impotence among males humiliated by their country's occupation. One could almost say that it was the equivalent of rape by the victor. ",,/r/europe/comments/9ccskx/dutch_resistance_members_celebrate_at_the_moment/e5ah9nx/,kurburux,1535929352

You couldn't have a conversation in your own home that was negative of the regime or the nation without the fear that you, your kids and the rest of your family would be dragged off and slaughtered.



The Gestapo were tiny, and had very few members, but their power was in their anonymity. Your own child could be an informant (Hitler Youth encouraged kids to snitch on their parents), and in that case, do you risk your son losing his dad and wife because he overheard something? Would you want that guilt on his shoulders for the rest of his life?


Many people wanted to do something and calling them cowards shows how uneducated you are on what life under the Nazis was like. Most Germans couldn't do anything because if one spoke up in front of three other people, one of those people is likely to rat the whole group out, and even if you didn't you would not be able to trust anyone. The regime essentially destroyed any chance of collaboration by making it impossible.


There is a reason why most of the big moves of resistance came from generals and party members and not from the citizens.

&gt;So now do you see why Serbifying Skanderbeg is a political move right?

The whole Kastrioti family is well connected to Serbian nobility. Those are the facts worth mentioning and on what Serbs like to focus obviously, but what Albanians do is worse. Purposefully leaving them out in order to continue this myth of pure Albanian hero that only Albanians can claim. 

&gt; Hint: What  does it mean when the father of a nation is not real? Means that Caucaz analbanians came to balkans no history etc. you know the drill.

Ahh it's the fear of losing ""muh autohtonous, we were here first"" bullshit claim. I guess it explains turning a blind eye to the historical facts.

Do you not see what you are saying is just as bad as the initial comment? John (Gjon) George ( Gjergj) are Christian names. To make said names exclusive to your nation is ridiculous. The only hints of his slavic background are from his mother, Vojsava. And this was reinforced by Schmitt who said that there are sources who claim she was a Muzaka, sources who claim she was a Serbian, and sources who claim she was a Bulgarian. Problem was she did not show up in the Brankovic family tree and Gjon Muzaka claimed Skanderbeg was related to him through her. So people just use ethnically amgibous when describing her. 

&gt;He was a hero to Serbs too you know

Uhh...im sorry but uhh......he plundered and scorched Serbian villages which landed him the title of ""Bandit King of Albania""....You can admire him for what he stood n all but a hero of Serbia? That would be like us claiming Dushan was a hero of Albanians.

&gt; but the page refers to his Serbian foloweres only as Slavs. Pretty biased article really.

The Zeta principality was a slavic one. Kings and Generals used the term slav to not anger those who argue wether or not Zeta are montenegrin, Serbian or Bulgarian. He even said so in a comment.

Thing is, it's still debated among historians. Nobody has certain proof as to if invading Greece changed anything. Most historians agree that June was the perfect time to invade because it was inbetween the mud season (spring/autumn), and the other reason for the delay is that they had a hard time preparing their men in the timeframe designated by the command. Only thing certain is that Crete really strained the Luftwaffe's airdrop capabilities.

&gt;And what about the guys from ""Nordic resistance movement"" who're politicians in SD?

What politicans that are currently in SD are you talking about? Give names, articles, sources. To the best of my knowledge they have none. This Tina Hallberg (I had to look her up) was there in the 90's, before they purged these people. Her husband was a municipality level politician who left/was purged from the party in 2013.

Ethnic swedes are white, and this is our country. We're fine with sharing it with foreigners as long as they adapt to our culture and our values. Claiming that ethnic swedes are not a people, have no history and no culture is what is racism around here. You might want to back off.

That report is made my an LO-owned think tank. LO, (Landsorganisationen), for those reading this who don't know, is a major union conglomerate. Until recently, the social democrats and LO were basically the political/union sides of the same coin. These days LO member sympathisers for S is down to 38,5 %, while SD sympathisers are up to 24,9 %, down from S at 46,4 % and SD up from 20 % last year. [Source](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/s-rasar-bland-lo-valjare)

Despite this, LO continues to fund the social democrat campaign, and has created a coordinated propaganda attack on SD in a number of  ads on youtube. All of which are at least 90 % downvoted, comments disabled. Or just no comment, no ratings. :ok\_hand:

Just wanted to point that out, they're biased as fuck. Reading the bullet point, I see no sources for any of this. Plus the spin is real. ""SD wants to weaken LO's influence in favour of smaller, alternative unions that are struggling? THEY'RE ANTI UNION! REEEEE!""

Without sources and knowing the circumstances behind this, I can't form an opinion based on this.

Mass immigration is not in the interest of the working class, and they generally don't care much for identity politics. It's as simple as that.

4135,"&gt;and Hungarians came to Transylvania in the 9th century.

More like 10th century. Either way the Romanians were mentioned in both Transylvania and Panonia at that time, by multiple sources.

Hungarians were a migratory, nomad steppe population that was never known for any large numbers. Soon they started to mix up with the people around, including with Romanians. First Hungarian king, Voic Stephen had possibly Romanian roots as well and was at first Orthodox iirc (very probably due to its Romanian heritage or at least the influence of Romanians from the area), but later he was swayed by Rome to Catholicism (Rome and Byzantium were just breaking around those times)

Hungarians suffered quite some losses and the Mongol invasion killed probably 60% of population and bring Hungarians to colapse. From there on Hungary had become an unofficial Vatican protectorate and stronghold, the Vatican using it in an attempt to spread its influence in EE.

You have lots of WE kings, nobles, colonists (Germanic and Slavic) send by Vatican to rebuild Hungary, thats why today Hungarians resemble their neighbours (Slavic, Romanian, Germanic) and very few still have the original Asiatic or Mongolic features. The official court language in Hungary become Latin and the spread of Catholicism become very strict. Ioan/Iancu/Janos Huniadi, a Romanian, could advance on a higher position (ruler of Transilvania)  only after he became Catholic for example.

When Germany lost the War, they were 1 month away from being able to produce 1,000 jet fighters a month. Each Jet fighter was estimated to be able to take out 15-20 proppeller allied planes on each take-off. 

There is no certainty on anything, Germany could have easily won the War. ",Greece,/r/europe/comments/9cd89i/parisiennes_celebrating_the_end_of_ww2_1945/e5a2qc9/,groatt86,1535914553

4154,"&gt;How can you even compare the two? The Soviet flag will still be a Soviet flag, while other swastikas have nothing to do with the Nazis...

I compared them because they're both widely seen as evil symbols, regardless of the swastikas original uses 90% of people now would immediately link it to the atrocities of Nazi Germany. 

&gt;It has never represented anything good...

It represented the 8.6 million russians who died to defeat the Nazis, of course not all were good, and the actions of the government certainly was not but they gave the most to defeat our shared enemy. I'd say that is representing some good. 

&gt;Perhaps, but besides fighting in self-defense, they still fought for a sick idea of Soviet imperialism

I disagree, I'd imagine the vast majority of red army soldiers fought to defend their home that was invaded much like the rest of Europe. I doubt the motive of the average soldier was Soviet imperialism. 

&gt;Of course, but one should not treat good things and bad things differently when they were done on orders, especially if that good was not carried from good intentions...

Of course bad should be treated as bad and good as good but the actions of people in WW2 should always be looked at through the lens of war. I've never fought in a war but I'd imagine a conflict as large as that really starts to mess with your sense of right and wrong. I'm not excusing bad actions, but being an average 20yr old and seeing suffering on a scale like that could break the strongest man's morals.

&gt;They were happy enough to cooperate them until then and invade countries together based on the same plan...

And France and Britain were happy to concede Austria and Czechoslovakia as long as it didn't effect them, and the U.S. was happy sitting and getting rich. Countries put themselves first and dictators put themselves before the country, doesn't mean the citizens are to blame or agree.

I'd say arming kids and civilians even when you're running out of food to feed them shows an unwillingness to surrender. Once again, the casualties on the islands show how willing they were to throw down their lives.

This is also a bad approach. Just equating them leaves the door open for the apologists from the other side. Their next step after ""equally bad"" is usually saying that Nazis got worse reputation simply for losing, not for being a greater danger to the humanity. And unlike Communists, Nazis have a good chance of coming back into fashion.

The only good way is to discuss the scale of evil for both sides precisely, avoiding the mental shortcuts.

What was the bad example? They are all previous cases of a minority aligned with a state which suppressed the majority being fucked over once the state fell and the majority took power. 

&gt;ask Christians.

Well the Turkic people weren't always Muslim, what do you think happened to the ones who didn't convert. There is a reason tengrism is pretty much gone now much like the various pagan religions in Europe are. 

&gt;Population exchanges and conversions.

As well as a fuck ton of massacres like the Armenian genocide, the Pontic genocide and so on. And then later stuff like the Istanbul pogrom.

&gt;oppressor lol. Those people didn't even care about being ruled by the Turks. Do you think the Balkanlar were fighting us for 700 straight years? No.

There were a lots of rebellions yeah. Also do you think treating a religious group as second class citizens isn't oppressive ?

Also the British empire ruled India for like a few hundred years and it wasn't always in a constant state of rebellion. But it doesn't mean the Indian people were fine with it and the British rulership wasn't oppressive.

&gt;the Russians came and spread their nowadays outdated ""pan slavism"" idea. Suddenly the Balkanlar wanted to be independent. Because they realized that they were Slavs and we were not.

If they were happy they wouldn't have rebelled. It's more like they saw the chance to not be treated as second class citizens any more. ",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/9carof/opression_assimilation_and_expulsion_of_bulgarian/e59vkku/,zxcv1992,1535907599

Cologne wasn't as good I thought but there was still tons of old buildings, their famous  Cologne cathedral which was absolutely massive , I couldn't believe my eyes , I never thought any church could be that big.

4310,"&gt; They kinda are contradictory. It's very simple, something that the human body is designed for is not cultural. You may have your own philosophical spin on what is cultural or biological but it is not relevant to science at all.

No that's not the definition at all.

It's ""cultural"" if a human being doesn't end up doing it without a culture leading to its acquisition. It's really that simple: human beings walking upright is cultural because a human growing up without a culture where people walk upright wwil not learn to walk upright.

That the human body is biologically evolved to walk upright doesn't change that; that's very common with memes. The human body is in fact evolved to do a great many things that human beings cultrally no longer do such as interlocking hair—ever noticed how the hair of other animals does not interlock the way human hair does? A lion doesn't comb its mane and yet it doesn't interlock the way it happens with a human when they don't comb yet there's a cultural idea in many places to either comb or cut your hair that wasn't always there. I take it we can agree that the preference people have for hair length is cultural yet biologically speaking human hair is clearly evolved to grow long.

&gt; Peafowl also isn't involved in actual reproduction, yet its purpose is to attract female peacocks.

Doesn't change that they aren't _sexual organs_.

However the difference is that there are no peacocks on regord where peacocks aren't attracted to peacock tails and many cultures on record where breasts are not remotely seen as something erotic.

And by your logic of ""everything that is attractive is a sexual organ"" that would make pretty faces a ""sexual organ""; that's absurd.

&gt; That's not how it works. Just because something is there doesn't mean it is easily traceable and exploitable.

In this case that's quite an understatement; there's really no way a human being with any remote certainty can say whether another human is ovulating thus there is always doubt as to the identity of the paternal parent; that's why prior to DNA tests there really was no way to establish the paternal identity.

&gt; It doesn't matter how cultures call it or how they deal with it, the existence of attraction to one specific person is a chemical reaction that happens in one's brain and activates through smell and it is present in all humans.

Which goes against pretty much all historical evidence. There is no ""attraction to one specific human"" and claiming there is just ignoring the wealth of historical evidence to the contrary is just willfull ignorance.

pair-bonding is a cultural thing introduced by Abrahamic religions and it's pretty obvious that even in Abrahamic cultures it's an act of people repressing their biological urges; they _want_ to sleep with others but they repress it because they gave someone their word that they wouldn't.",De korthaar verdient niets dan den pijn des hellevuurs,/r/europe/comments/9ca5do/naked_europe_covers_up_the_home_continent_of/e59nq1e/,UseTheProstateLuke,1535899959

Low-yield tactical nukes would fly, and the policicos would assure their populations that these are only going to be used against military targets. Maybe the mainland US's civilian population would be unmolested by atomic devastation, but that's not the only, or most tactically relevant, way to use a nuke.

But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past. It is not that they are afraid of being convinced. They fear only to appear ridiculous or to prejudice by their embarrassment their hope of winning over some third person to their side.

4461,"&gt; So it was true that the uprising was democratic at first, but without foreign intervention it wouldn't be much of an affair?

yes. the point that there were, by western standards, more moderate forces in the uprising early on is moot, because that uprising lacked the power to do anything. only by it becoming a proxy war (with Qatar being the first big contributor, and them putting their money on political sharia in the form of the Muslim Brotherhood) did an actual Syrian war really come about.

there are two major forces that hold onto significant territory still formally rebelling against Assad today. One is HTS (al qaeda), the other is AAS (turkish mercs). One is political jihad, the other is imperialism and often accused of religious opression. the rest of the non-ISIS rebels are ordered into some form of allegiance with one of those two, or they're ineffectual. the SDF is not engaged in rebellion. 

the thing to do is to look up numbers. late 2011 the FSA claims to have 25k fighters. the SAA numbers almost 200k at the time. the FSA does not have an airforce. In a direct confrontation there is no comparison between the two forces. And at this time, already, the FSA is receiving material support from foreign partners. 

the question I'm really trying to get at is: was there a popular uprising against Assad, standing up for near-western values, coming from within Syria that had a chance at toppling the regime? And I conclude that the answer is ""no"". There is no Syrian civil war. There is an imperialist proxy war. This is morally relevant, and really the point that should be stressed. Say what you will about the events of the 80s, but the death toll was a LOT lower than that of the last 7 years. And we are currently seeing the United States trying to instigate rebellion in Iran, which, if succesful, is going to cause even greater suffering for the sake of the empire. 

as far as I can see that's just the way of the world, it's inherent to power. but it really grinds my gears when people act or talk like the west has a moral high ground over anyone.

I know that decisions were made by landowners as there was an income threshold you had to pass before you could vote in elections. Later on in the occupation Catholics could vote but I know they couldn't run for office during the early years of British rule in Ireland and were restricted as to what universities they could study at, so I'd imagine it was much harder to make friends in the right places and form any organised political movements.

Add to this laws that Protestant family members had priority in inheriting property and all you needed was one disgruntled or particularly zealous son to decimate your family wealth, making you ineligible to vote. Over time wealth would then flow to Protestant, Anglo-Irish landholders, often concentrated in the north, making the only group that could properly vote, rich Catholics, slowly lose influence to pro-Westminster families.",,/r/europe/comments/9ca1lx/yesterdsy_german_diplomatic_missions_flags_were/e59dx2x/,INFPGeorge,1535885730

Doing that and then continuing with accusations has left Japan with a very bad taste of what happens when you admit things.

Korean and Chinese politicians using the accusations for local political gain doesn't make Japan more likely to cooperate either.

&gt;I don't see how you can be against deconstructing gender roles and at the same time advocate for more freedom for kids to choose to be who they want to be

I'm against **forcing** the gender roles when they don't fit the individual, I'm for general application of traditional roles in the first instance, because more often than not they fit very well and I believe are good for the individual.

&gt;that's like the whole problem with gender roles, adults forcing kids to be or act in a certain way

My point you were responding too was more that I don't believe children should exposed larger political/social debates and issues like ""toxic masculinity"", ""the glass ceiling"", ""the wage gap"" or talk about whether progressive gender roles are good for them. 

I think it's beneficial, however, for them to see adults (in and outside of traditional roles) interacting with one another. I also think it is generally beneficial to society for children to be taught traditional roles in the first instance so they have a reference point for their history, culture and actions.

&gt;kids who feel like they should conform to a certain standard that society imposes on them based on their sex are unhappier than kids who don't feel the need to conform to some predefined notion of what it means to be a boy or girl.

I completely agree, and the roles shouldn't be so strict that a child ever feels like this, but I refuse the idea that these traditional roles have no value and should not be taught, or should be taught in a way that strips cultural/historical identity from them. I know that when I was a lad being given a role and responsibilities (even if I didn't enjoy some of them at the time) made me feel very motivated and like I was helping my family - It was certainly a good thing for my wellbeing.",,/r/europe/comments/9b748d/quarter_of_14yearold_girls_in_uk_selfharm/e59azlc/,Slumjam11,1535878657

4682,"&gt; I think ""International English"" or ""Business English"" is on its way to becoming a separate language.

This is what would have happened a couple hundert years ago, the two languages would have split. Today however, a language is fixed in place by the educational system and the mass media, and there is just so much language related infrastructure, that a new language can not take off.

For a new language to emerge, it needs to be able to gradually change over a long time, without being interrupted, and this is simply not possible in the modern world.

Since we have much more language related infrastructure and language related authorities, the rate at which a language is able to change has probably been reduced to close to zero.",,/r/europe/comments/9bufyi/average_number_of_languages_spoken_by_citizens/e59b5mo/,AffectionateYear,1535879060

roundabouts are good for many reasons, and slow speeds aren't an obstacle to cars either, but to regulate the demand of private motorized mobility you don't have to make the city undriveable, you just have to make it expensive.

4768,"Ah, sorry, I was under the impression that I was speaking to a Ukrainian - should really look at usernames.

Anyway - you're really, really missing the point of the whole thing. I don't know whether it is from the lack of information or outright willful blindness (since you clearly can read at least Russian, if not the rest of regional languages).

If I were to assume the former, than I'll have to let you know that the rebel regions **overwhelmingly** voted for the government of the people who were thrown out in a coup in Kiev (which mostly voted against them and was hostile throughout). They were, understandably, disillusioned as to remaining in this country, where their choice is treated that way again (this was the second ""revolution"" in Ukraine). I guess, if Yanukovich stayed in there instead of running off to Russia you'd have to acknowledge these events as a proper civil war - but he didn't. The general feeling of Donetsk towards euromaidan is well known - the (short) battle against buses of activists brought in there, for God only knows what reason, showed it pretty well - all that happened long before a single Russian citizen was claimed to have crossed the border. Further events (villagers stopping armed columns, police switching sides, etc.) are a further proof of actual sympathies over there. They were *absolutely overwhelming*.

Now, in addition to Donbass, there is a number of regions in Ukraine with fairly safe majorities of ""antimaidan"" crowd. These regions didn't have any sizeable demonstrations and other such things - yet since it wasn't an absolutely clear-cut case, Kiev managed to retain control and no Russian interference happened there.

Now, back to Donetsk: Obviously I'm not an idiot and I understand full well that two regions without heavy weapons could not possibly withstand an assault of a mobilised, second biggest post-Soviet army by themselves. Russia, very clearly, had a large part in arming them and helping them with volunteers, expertise, and even temporary military assistance - pretty much a mirror of American coalition's actions in Syria. That's a given.

Now, I'm finally getting to your concern: if a government in Belarus gets overthrown and replaced with radically different one against the wishes of vast majority of people even in some regions (though, as I said, we don't have regional differences of this sort) - I'd really hope that Russia would indeed come in and protect the people who *already took up arms* against a government that they consider to be illegitimate. If something like this were to happen here, I would really, really prefer to not have these people crushed by tanks and ultra-nationalist ""volunteer battalions"" using symbols of organisations responsible for murdering 1/4 of my grandfather's generation.

I understand that you have a side, I understand that you believe your side to be right, and I even understand that your point of view is valid - what I don't get is that you somehow only see these things from the point of view of one side, the side which really is in no danger of getting murdered or at least imprisoned for decades in case of defeat (they'd just lose a couple of regions populated by people who hate them), while seeing the support for the other side as something approaching crime or insanity.

That's really all I have to say about this hypothetical trouble we'd be in due to Russian actions, but, then again - we really are in no danger of that due to demographic and political issues. I'll perhaps surprise you by saying that I am, in fact, angry at Russian leadership over their handling of this issue but it's over something quite opposite of what you have a problem with - I think that they betrayed their supporters from throughout the South-Eastern Ukraine by **not** doing a full invasion and limiting their involvement to merely material assistance to the people already in rebellion against Kiev. These people also tried, but they didn't have the overwhelming numbers possessed in Donbass, and thus are now, at best, in prison, or, in case of Odessa - burned to death by fascist group who still didn't face any responsibility for their actions.

Sorry to disappoint you but this point of view is endemic throughout Baltkrievija. With little to no regional variation (I'm personally from ""half-Polish"" Grodno). ",Belarus,/r/europe/comments/9buot0/prorussian_rebel_leader_alexander_zakharchenko/e5987y9/,idio3,1535872509

4780,"The strategic rock formation on which the castle lies was very well-known and inhabited since Roman times, when it was called *Mons Feretrius* because of a small temple dedicated to Jupiter Feretrius on the top of it.

The town became important later during the IV century, when **Saint Leo** (companion of the more famous **Saint Marinus**) choose it to become the religious center of the region. The diocese founded here took the name of the rock and eventually gave name to the surrounding areas: *Montefeltro*.

During the Middle Ages **Byzantines, Goths, Franks and Lombards** fought bitterly over the control of this position. Each one of them developed the existent fortification on the top of the rock in its own way, but most of what we see today was built during the **Renaissance**, when the walls and towers were redisgned to withstand cannon crossfire and counterattack on multiple directions.

After the Duchy of Urbino fell under direct control of the Papal State, the castle lost its defensive purpose and became a prison used by the **Roman Inquisition**. Among other inmates here was tortured and killed the famous [Count of Cagliostro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Cagliostro). The town was then conquered during the Italian Unification and was never altered since then.

4861,"Thanks for sharing this link. Worthwhile reading. Although my main conclusion is: we have to seriously rethink the whole way we deal with mass crops, pesticides and herbicides. We need them to feed mankind, but if nature dies because of them, mankind will die anyway. And the prophylactic use of pesticides, as it is done with beets nowadays, in the long run is not sustainable anyway. It is already causing resistance in the pests it meant to control, in Italy and the south of France for instance and yes, the pesticides leach out from sugar beet fields to the surroundings, they stay in the soil for more than a year and following flowering crops are polluted by them. There are also now farmers who don't use neonicotinoid treated seeds, as farmers have done for many years before such seeds became available. Also, using pesticides prophylactically obviously increases their use, as it means you also use them in those years where you normally wouldn't have used them because the pest you want to destroy, didn't occur.

In 1907 in minnesota which had a sizeable population of finnish immigrants and one fault of the of the finns was the high membership in labour unions and socialist movements. So the factory owners tried to get rid of the strikers and deny them citizenship by trying to refer to the old notion that finns are not white, but asian mongols. This would have put them under the asian exclusion act. This however never came to be.

The modern version of this fingol meme comes from 4chan.

So ? It was explicitly to put countries in the American sphere of influence and not that useful.

They thought it would be convenient to starve them all because it fit within their plans for extermination of Slavs.  It wouldn't have happened to a dutch city, or a french city, even though they bombed cities in those countries to hell, because it wasn't in the designs of the Nazis to do so.

5239,"\&gt; Why are you obsessed with concentration camps being the only mark of a genocide?  

It was the standard procedure for the Nazi Germany.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; They tried to starve every living person in Leningrad, they didn't even accept surrender. That's a genocide to try and kill every man woman and child. ""it's just war"" is not the ""ha, gotcha"" that you think it is. If someone called the holomodor a genocide I wouldn't disagree with them, would you?

Then we would need to redefine genocide.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; It wasn't about the books it was about the historians who wrote them (who you said were nonexistent) who also agree there was definitely a genocide caused by 'occupation polices' and 'slavic anti-sentiment'. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not really, how can you know the claims of those historians if you've never read those books? You've just seen the word genocide in the title and went for it, but nowhere in the summary does it mention Slavic genocide.

5261,"&gt; If a party is relevant and against our constitution it will be banned. 

And how do you find out if it's against our constitution? By waiting for a press release where they publicize their anti-constitutional agenda in detail? 

&gt; If its isnt banned its not against our constitution and there is no base for any action. 

Would you say there shouldn't be investigations against people who haven't been found guilty? 

Being watched by the Verfassungsschutz is a form of investigation. 

&gt; Its literally a dictatorship method to place any upcoming party that could hurt your government under surveillance.

Then it's already too late and we are living in a dictatorship already. When 'Die Linke' was founded in 2007 it was put under surveillance by the Verfassungsschutz. On federal level that lasted till 2014, Bavaria still has them under surveillance. 

&gt; Another thing is: if you dont have faith in our justice system to ban partys who are against our constitution, what exactly is placing them under surveillance supposed to achieve in your eyes?

The point of the surveillance is to figure out if the party actively works to undermine the constitution. Because parties don't usually publish their anti-constitutional agenda, that would get them banned. 

And if the party actually has an anti-constitutional agenda, the surveillance will gather evidence that can be used in the trial where the party ban is decided.

&gt; Napoleon Bonaparte is portrayed as a short French Empereror who lost to the Russian winter.

Only to those who study history at the surface level. To anyone else he's remembered as a visionary who ushered in a new era in Europe, the Napoleonic code influencing the entire world even.

&gt;Do you think that's British propaganda or history?

Him being short is the former. Napoleon being defeated by the winter is also an oversimplification that removes any agency that the Russians had in defeating Napoleon.

&gt;History is not shaped the way it is today thanks to neutral interpretation or a factual understanding of the past, but by political and cultural leaders on the “winning” side of history exerting their power.

Bullshit.

&gt; For us, the holocaust is seen as a unnecessary atrocity committed by the nazis

Because it was, yes.

&gt;while events like the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or the holodomor, are either overshadowed or seen as essential military decisions.

The former is remembered as such because it was, the latter is not seen as such by any historian worth his salt. Neither is it overshadowed.

&gt;Do you think if Germany had won the war these events would have been viewed the same way it is today? It's a simple question.

I've already answered this.

&gt;The holocaust is well documented too, but while that is taught in every western country and is collectively viewed as a horrible event, other genocides like holodomor or the great chinese famine goes unnoticed. 

If they went unnoticed you wouldn't be typing about it. Besides, I studied both of those in school when I was fucking 12. The only reason they weren't discussed more than the Holocaust is because in my country the latter had an actual impact. There's no malice at play here.

&gt;You need to look up what propaganda is and how it's used.

And you need to look up what a historian is and what they do.

&gt;urthermore, bringing up wars that happened several hundred years ago is irrelevant, as the depiction and public perception of events change over time.

The history of the Pelopennesian War was a contemporary account and even that managed to paint an impartial view on the conflict.

&gt;It's not so much that history is written by the victor, it's that history is written by those with bias and authority. 

History is written by historians.

&gt;And often once it is written, it becomes true because it is accepted by the majority as such.

Unless you're living in a totalitarian regime; no.

&gt;Why do you think so many people today believe it was USA who defeated facism and saved Europe, while in actuality it was the Soviets?

...Because both of them played a significant part? Anyone teaching you different doesn't deserve to teach.

&gt;Oh yeah? In what country and at what age did you learn about it? Source?

Twelve years old, the Netherlands.

&gt;Soviet Union didn't lose the war.

Yes, they did. It ended with them breaking up and ceasing to exist. If you're talking about World War II I don't see how that's relevant to the Holodomor.

&gt; While we're talking about the Soviet Union, another false depiction of history is the space race. Soviet Union essentially won the space race, but USA moved the goalpost to the moon.

So they didn't win, then? There was no moving the goalposts, the entire goal of the Space Race was to outdo each other until one of the two nations gave up. The Soviets actually had lunar missions planned but these never got off the ground due to catastrophic failures, bad luck and the United States managing to beat them to the punch.

If you're going to bring up examples please take the time to read up on them before you embarrass yourself further.

&gt;No. It's almost as if you want to spread your narrative by denying essential quotes that bear great meaning to the way history is depicted in the modern age.

And it's almost as if you have an overinflated sense of your own historical knowledge and are failing to get your point across.

5351,"&gt;The ""but gay men can marry women too, so it's equal"" argument is just idiotic

No its not, they **are in fact, equal**, you are literally lying when you say they otherwise.

How you talk about it is important, because it influences how you think about it. By constantly talking about marriage as if it was a ""status"" and was unfairly denied to gay couples creates a false illusion of what marriage is or calling everyone who rejects gay ""marriage"" hateful ( I provided an example of ancient civilizations to disprove this) appeals to pro LGBT as the more vitreous view because no body wants to be associated with the denying people rights or hatefulness when society declared it to be taboo. This is one of the reasons, as mentioned in the statistics I linked, which caused people to extremely overestimate the amount of LGBT people.

&gt;all your arguments are based on semantic technicalities

What are you talking about. Before you said my argument was basically ""that's how it's always been"", which is not semantics, and now you say its semantics.

 The gay ""rights"" movement's whole existence is to challenge the definition of the word, do you expect me to discuss this issue without actually focusing on the word?

Unfortunately we do not have the technology yet where I can just plug my brain into the internet to transfer my understanding to someone so until then I have to use language to express what I mean.   

I explained why its defined the way it is, the history of the word, and why it makes no sense for it to be defined any other way, what more could I possibly say? 

&gt;You seem to think I care about the word, I don't, I care about the rights that are awarded

The definition of the term determines this, or else the LGBT community would not want it to be redefined. Its like saying ""I don't care what ""criminal"" means, I care about who gets arrested""
How the law defines criminal will result in who gets arrested, no? 

&gt; awards same-sex couples the same rights as a married couple

I understand that every person should be treated equally, but the idea that now other relationships, relationship being how you interact with someone else, be treated equally as well is ridicules. There is no reason why different relationships should be treated the same, the implications of this are horrible, if you accept this view than I demand that my relationship with my car receive the same rights are a married couple, or my relationship with my toaster, or dog. For this I brought the example of man-car relationship in multiple comments, I even pointed out how pedophilia and polygamy rights groups are growing to show that these implications are real. 

&gt; happiness, wellbeing and dignity of gay people.

These are completely subjective and all I have to do is claim that being married to my car brings me happiness well being and dignity, will you support giving my man car relationship the same rights as those of married couples? 

&gt;My argument is that marriage in the constitution should be redefined

If you want to redefine the word, then you care about the word. 

&gt;..do you have one other than ""that's how it's always been""?

If you read my last comment, I pointed out that was never the only reason I gave. 

&gt;You have not given me a single valid reason why one of the above should not happen

Every thing I wrote. 

Would you like me to randomly chose one from my previous comments? Roll some dice. 

How about this one, Because there is no valid reason why you would. You don't just passively do it unless you have a reason not to, you need a reason in order to do it.
&gt; and more importantly why should the state recognize any other romantic relationship? 

Or  even this one

&gt;&gt; I never said you could marry anyone. . . I said you can marry someone you love

&gt;But you can love anyone, even another married person, or even an underage person.

The list goes on 

I will continue on the other thread so please any responses be there.

If they reach this legitimisation, noone afterwards can ever vote again.

5505,"&gt; People are practically begging other parties to switch their immigration policy from whatever 'centrist' neoliberal crap they've pegged it on for the past 40 fucking years, and close the goddamn borders

In your comment and in r/europe, things are often portrayed like there are two alternatives, good and bad. Completely open or closed borders. People seem to think that we're still in the situation from 2015 when the borders were overrun. This hasn't been the case for years now, and the political attitude from mayor parties has shifted quite substantially. With Frontec, the Turkey refugee deal, border checks in numerous Schengen countries, the closure of the Balkan route etc..., we are actually pretty close to a ""closed borders situation"". The bureaucratic machinery in Europe and it's countries has been in action for years now, overworking immigration policy towards a much tougher stance. But there is obviously a lot of work to be done, especially concerning deportations. The proposal to literally *close* the borders is a ludicrous one and incredibly complicated and costly, because of the negative implications to movement and commerce between EU states. 


&gt; It makes me sick to see how many people place the responsibility of the politician's behaviors at the voters feet. Enough. It is political parties that must present an alternative to the AfD; not voters. Until such time, the AfD and its' European counterparts will have votes, and should get votes. They are the only voice representing a large part of the European voters.

I get what you're saying and i agree for the first part. But i'm not sure how familiar you are with the AFD and its internal change over the last years. They started out as a euro-critic fiscally conservative party during the financial crisis and have since been gradually infiltrated by far right and even Nazi supporters and conspiracy theorists, while the more rational, moderate people at the top have been pushed out. So while i would agree that other parties need to take a tougher stance on migration, the AFD should absolutely not be an option because of the dangers that come from putting people like that into power. ""They won't be too bad"" and ""Well then they should get the votes"" is what is going to open Pandora's Box. This shit happened before, you know? You've probably heard about it...

5678,"&gt; ...which industries? I can not imagine having an unpaid internship in finance or STEM.

Humanities, for example - unpaid internships are popular there. Also, state institutions (like UKE) only offer unpaid internships - even for technical positions.

I get where you come from: I study Computer Science myself and almost all offers I have seen for internships, from big or small companies, are paid and with a job contract. But our situation is an exception, not a norm in this job market.

&gt; For a dorm room - you do not NEED to

There are plenty of things we don't need to do, but we do them anyway and I think getting your own accommodation is one of these things. You don't have to waste time on commute (I usually spend two hours a day to get to the uni and back), it gives you a degree of independence and freedom that lets you do things you wouldn't have done otherwise (if just by the virtue of not having to tell your parents what that is) and it teaches responsibility. 

&gt; but people who live further away have the preference, so it makes sense, than to give a place to someone who can travel by train (as most Unis are near metro stations anyway) People from low-income families also have preference. 

But if we had more places in dorms and student houses the rules wouldn't be so strict. 

&gt; Room sharing is obvious, because you pay half the price of what you would pay for a single room.

Not really - the premium for a single room is usually about 50% of the rent of a double room. And it also doesn't explain some other policies, like refusing to house people of opposite sex together unless they're married.

&gt; I only agree with noone building new housing for students, but I assure you, that those would cost just as much as for a normal room anywhere else, maybe 1/10 less.

The government already subsidises dorms, as their rent is usually lower than what is on the market. By building more dorms we can increase their accessibility, because in reality for most people it's not the money that are the problem - it's that they can't get a room in a dorm.

It's either ""könnten wir"" or ""wir möchten"", the first is too impatient (""...nun endlich""?), the latter too demanding. ""möchten wir"" makes no sense, WTH would you ask the waiter whether you want to pay, and ""können wir"" would be rightly answered with ""I dunno, do you have enough money""?

Use ""wir würden gerne"", signalling both your readiness and desire, indeed, pleasure, to pay, suggesting but not demanding that the waiter make settling your debt possible. Then, there's another way to be polite in German and that's by being efficient: Signal *non-aggressively* from afar, if you get attention, say ""Die Rechnung"", you'll get a subtle nod. Also works with waiters completely laden with dishes. Pleasantries can wait until you actually get your bill.

Side note: It's always ""wir"" when there's multiple persons at the table, unless for some reason you really only want to pay for yourself because you're leaving early or something. Better to say that out straight, though, especially with a Dutch accent.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupied_territories_of_Georgia

The report prepared by the National Committee on American Foreign Policy and the Institute for the Study of Human Rights, raised concerns that Russia ""not only failed to withdraw, it expanded territory under its control beyond the pre-war conflict zones"" and Russia ""established a troop presence in 51 villages it did not control before the war and conducted military patrols on territory it did not previously hold.""[53]

In one of the Georgian villages in South Ossetia, Russian forces bulldozed the Georgians' houses and built new military bases in their places for the Russian 58th Army.[54]

On 2 August 2009, Russian troops reportedly moved the South Ossetian boundary markers about 500 meters into the Georgian-controlled territory in the village of Kveshi.

The process of border demarcation continued in February 2013.[60] Russian troops started the installation of barbed wire barriers to separate the South Ossetian territory from the rest of Georgia.[59][61] In some instances, the Georgian residents could not access their plots or come out of their homes because the border of barbed wire runs through or around their property.[59] According to Georgia's Interior Ministry, there was no fencing activities at the administrative border of Georgia’s other breakaway region of Abkhazia, where the Enguri river served as ""a natural dividing line"", but Russian troops were blocking the pathways to prevent ""illegal"" movement across the administrative boundary line.[62] The new South Ossetia-Georgia border extended between 50–300 meters beyond the occupation line.[63][64] By August 2013, an estimated 27 kilometers of barriers had been built.[65]

5735,"&gt;For me even “pretty airtight” isn’t enough to kill someone. “If they are not sure”?? I think you are very naive about how court cases work. A jury returns guilty or not guilty, there’s no in-between.

The jury decides whether a person is guilty or not *based on all the given evidence and circumstances*, and then the judge decides on the sentence *based on all the evidence and circumstances that might aggravate or mitigate the sentence*. The legal system isn't as straightforward and simplistic as you think it is.

&gt;If you are advocating executing children then I think you would have to agree that societies as a whole around the world (except some particularly brutal sharia systems) would consider that wrong.

In the UK the age of criminal culpability is 10. 

Let's go over the case notes, shall we? Both boys confess that they were in the mall looking for a child to kidnap and kill. Their original idea was to take the child and throw them into traffic, but they decided on something far crueler instead. Nevertheless they had the *direct intention* to kill another person, and if you want to read up on how they tortured, sexually assaulted and killed Bulger then you're more than welcome to.

5743,"&gt; Your accusation of a strawman was wrong, that's the point.

No it wasn't. You just did not understand. Btw, there were like three of them. Did you drop the others because you understood those?

&gt; You stated we are unaware of racism against Romanis and I replied with an example that explicitly implies we are.

I already explained to you that being aware of history doesn't save you of being ignorant of what's happening today as you obviously are because you wrote in the first comment: 

&gt; and my gf is a pretty roma Bulgarian girl, German people are very friendly to her

Implying in the context of racist Germans that they are not. 

&gt; I am aware of this and Turkish migrants

You obviously are not or you wouldn't make such ridiculously statements:

&gt; Walking outside you constantly see mixed black and European couples, mixed white and East Asian couples etc. How often do you see Arabic or Turkish women being allowed to date European men by their families? 

Or you are lying intentionally. So what is it? 

&gt; explain to me how this is relevant to me actually changing from Turkish to migrants, which I never did given the quote given

So do you say I made up the word ""migrants"" (it was ""immigrants"" btw) in this discussion? 

&gt; What generalisations? 

All those groups of people you are labeling with your prejudices. The actual topic here. Please pay attention. 

&gt; Of course not, the point was you used the term projection to an anecdotal statement regarding conservative Islamic practices

Which you brought up after I told you that it is a practice that is **not** common here. You disregarded that and started to come up with some story from London. You still disregard it and now being faced with your strategy you try to shift the discussion to either me or some kind of ""radical Islam"" thing that seems to be a virus that has to apply in the same way everywhere which would justify your failed ""observation"" regarding those Turk and Arab females. 

&gt; You are awful at arguing. 

Let's remember, you've started out with the usual ""I'm not a racist, I have a black friend""-argument to negate what OP said regarding racism in Germany to swiftly switch over to some biased observation of yours that those arabs and turks won't let their daughters play with the whites and because of that whites should not be called racist. 

That pitiful back paddling you've started to practice since then and shifting the blame and topic from that to me or to other countries is now what you consider arguing?

So did you really expect Germans to tell it to your face that they have prejudices against your Zigeuner gf (even if they'd know that she is because how do you?)? I'm sorry mate, but you have not a single clue. OP is right here. Eastern EU immigrants never had it good in Germany. They have always been seen as something like ""2nd class whites"" with a hell lot of prejudices that they also try to enforce wherever it was possible. And there is and was a lot of racism against poles in east Germany even before the wall went down. 


&gt; How often do you see Arabic or Turkish women being allowed to date European men by their families? 

All the time...you must be very new in Germany or blinded by you prejudice. Can't explain it otherwise.

Indeed, yay for dumb Americans and the Americanization of Culture :D

&gt;just your comment made that sentence even more ridiculous - even people from colonizing nations shouldn't feel shame and not all of their ancestors benefited.)

More than indeed, we weren't even allowed to migrate nor do commerce with the Castilian Colonies up to the beginning of the 18th century when my part of Spain became legally ""Castile"" (Spain was a Confederation of Kingdoms under one Monarch before) after the War of the Spanish Succession.

It's also one of the reasons why I find it baffling to call those Colonies ""Spanish"", because they were and their successors are culturally, linguistically and politically Castilian (In the Aragon Crown for example before it got abolished Constitutional and Parliamentary Rights were a big deal, the King here couldn't be just a despot like in the Kingdom of Castile). Heck, it's even funier to see the reaction of some Latin Americans who come here to Spain (can also say this sadly about Spaniards from monolingual parts of Spain) expecting here to see a uniform country with one language one people one culture similar to theirs when that's simply not the case.

Once I got asked by an American Exchange student if I felt closer to Latin America than to Europe because of language, culture and so on and I had to laugh at her, because linguistically -no, my ""first-first 'home' language"" isn't Spanish, culturally also nope, they feel foreign to me and I could go on, but you get my point...",EUROPE IS UNITED NOW UNITED IT MAY REMAIN OUR UNITY IN DIVERSITY,/r/europe/comments/9btp6m/map_of_new_spain_in_1810/e57cmnb/,makeredo,1535793086

Talk about blind arrogance!

#Copied below for easier reading;

&gt;Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said that Latin America should adopt a “quota system” to better manage the Venezuelan migrant crisis.

&gt;Sanchez was speaking on Thursday during a trip to Colombia, which has been inundated with hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans fleeing economic meltdown in their homeland.

&gt;“If we think of Latin America as a supportive community, it’s clear that a quota system could be a good solution,” Sanchez told Blu Radio.

&gt;The socialist PM said it’s a similar deal to that which Spain is proposing in the European Union in the face of mass migration from Africa in particular.

&gt;Last month, the EU’s border agency warned that Spain is developing into the chief path for migrants trying to enter Europe.

&gt;“This is a challenge affecting not just Spain, which is logically the border, but the whole European Union and that’s why we need solidarity amongst all member states,” said Sanchez during a two-day visit to Colombia, during which he met President Ivan Duque, an ardent critic of Venezuela counterpart Nicolas Maduro.

&gt;In 2015 the EU came up with a quota plan to distribute migrants after more than a million arrived by sea as civil war in Syria saw numbers surge.

&gt;But many countries dragged their feet in agreeing to take in their quotas, while the likes of Hungary and Poland refused outright to accept refugees.

&gt;Some 1.6mn Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015 as four years of recession and hyperinflation the International Monetary Fund predicts will reach 1mn percent this year have left large swathes of the population in poverty.

&gt;And this in a country that in the past welcomed many migrants fleeing authoritarian regimes elsewhere.

&gt;“Venezuela was a place that welcomed many Spaniards, Galicians, Canary Islanders during the Francoist dictatorship,” said Sanchez, referring to the 36-year reign of Francisco Franco from 1939 to 1975.

&gt;“They lived and prospered there. So we’re a country with great solidarity. We feel very close to this drama that Venezuela is going through so we hope that Venezuelans will open a dialogue.”

&gt;Some 2.3mn Venezuelans live outside the country of 30.6mn, according to the UN, with the numbers heading to Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina and Brazil steadily increasing.

&gt;Venezuela’s far-left authorities have dismissed the claims of economic crisis as fake news and a “right-wing plot,” blaming the country’s troubles on United States and EU led sanctions.

&gt;Meanwhile, Colombia, Peru and Ecuador want more international aid to help manage the surge in Venezuelan migration that is overwhelming public services in those countries, a Peruvian official said.

&gt;“Support has been given and we value it, but it has to increase in line with increasing migration,” said Cesar Bustamante, an official at Peru’s foreign ministry who met with representatives of Colombia and Ecuador on Wednesday in Lima.

&gt;“More demand for public services means more resources. There’s no way around it. We have to provide those services, with our own resources or with international help,” he said in a telephone interview.

&gt;Bustamante said developed countries should do more to support United Nations programmes that are assisting migrants in South America and should offer funds to countries hosting them.

&gt;On Thursday, Spanish Prime Minister Sanchez said that the European Union would give Latin America €35mn to help with the migrant crisis.

&gt;The United States has given nearly $31mn in aid for Venezuelans since fiscal year 2017, as well as $18.5mn for Colombia, home to more Venezuelan migrants than any other country, the US State Department has said.

&gt;However, the United States has not eased its immigration policy to accommodate more Venezuelans, underscoring new challenges in the developing world as US President Donald Trump shifts the burden of hosting desperate migrants and refugees to places with less capacity to absorb them.

&gt;Last week, Peru’s foreign minister said that he had spoken with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about funding needs.

&gt;Colombia, Peru and Ecuador discussed Venezuelan immigration in Lima on Wednesday at a gathering of the Andean Community, one of a number of regional meetings aimed at tackling migration issues.

&gt;In a joint statement, the three countries called on Caracas to facilitate passports for Venezuelan citizens to strengthen regional security.

&gt;Bolivia, an ally of Maduro, attended Wednesday’s meeting as the fourth member of the Andean Community, but it did not sign the joint statement.",,/r/europe/comments/9c13u4/quota_system_urged_to_tackle_venezuelan_migrant/e578y1w/,NeoSupaZupa,1535785013

When I moved out (Spanish BTW) with my girlfriend, we were both 24 and our apartment was 80% of both our total salaries combined before taxes.

It was HARD, let me tell you. I've been lucky and life has treated me great (plus I have worked my ass off for 2 decades) but many people are living literally on the edge.

Things like ""I have a job, I can support myself"" are not necessary tied together in many countries.

And while now there are quite a few social aids in place, money is limited and 80 to 85% go to immigrants (statistically, not making things up, as the lists of receivers are public).

If you look at the history of any European country, it is tangled up with the history of other European countries. Even the UK, which likes to see itself as being 'semi-detached' from mainland Europe, has centuries of alliances and wars with other nations which have shaped its character. From invasion by the Romans, and by the Danes and Swedes, and by the Norman French, and then wars with the Dutch, and the Spanish, and the Germans ... it is a dysfunctional family, but it is our family.",,/r/europe/comments/9byjoj/im_an_american_who_loves_this_subreddit_and_i/e579hml/,JigsawPig,1535786127

5980,"Not a historian but having California and Texas in your territory didn't make you magically a world power. When Mexico became independent those territories were barely populated. There were probably more indigenous nomads than people living in towns and cities. 

California and Texas really started to become what they are today in the 20th century, and both world wars had even some influence in their development. Immigration was a huge factor too. Mexico also got several European immigrants like the US in the 19th century but definitively most went to the US. Mexico was a mess in the 19th century, who would emigrate to a country that was often in internal wars?

So with lower population that the US, and lower immigration than the US I really doubt Texas and California would had changed Mexico's future drastically. It could had been a little bit richer perhaps, but there would definitively be no Silicon Vally in California.",Mexico,/r/europe/comments/9btp6m/map_of_new_spain_in_1810/e579qda/,ErickFTG,1535786639
