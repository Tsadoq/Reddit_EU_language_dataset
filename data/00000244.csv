Every time it happens again there's a reason why this time it's different.

What also doesn't help is that the way people are expecting each other to remember it is a more explicit version of events so that makes people draw a chariracture in their head and that stops people from recognizing it when it does happen because it's more subtle then than what they've been told in the history books.","Maar oma, waarom heeft u zo'n grote negerlul?",/r/europe/comments/8eelr3/today_24_april_is_the_armenian_genocide/dxvdmgv/,my_farts_will_go_on,1524547748

25,"&gt;Europe’s new privacy rules are no silver bullet

They are not. But I don't recall anyone ever claiming they were.

They *will* improve the protection of our online privacy and the control over our own data, and that's a win nonetheless.

&gt;But that doesn’t mean individuals will be given carte blanche over “free” digital services that rely on selling advertising based on people’s online habits.

In all honesty, free services are *usually* never truly free. You can't expect commercial companies to provide actual free services without any restrictions. They'd go bankrupt within a day.

I remember when Spotify came out with the free version and people started crying about the ads they played. ""What's up with the ads? This isn't truly free?!!?!?""

Yeah, well, pay for the ad-free version if you don't like ads. That's how it works. Companies need to make money in order to survive. If you don't wanna pay for a subscription, you'll get ads or other shit thrown at you.

The same goes for Facebook. Something needed to be done. It needed to be regulated. But you can't expect Facebook to become truly free. So no, no silver bullet.

107,"&gt;""I have conducted a series of conversations with competent and influential Turkish personages, and these are my impressions: A large segment of the Ittihadist [Young Turk] party maintains the viewpoint that the Turkish empire should be based only on the principle of Islam and Pan-Turkism. Its non-Muslim and non-Turkish inhabitants should either be forcibly islamized, or otherwise they ought to be destroyed. These gentlemen believe that the time is propitious for the realization of this plan. The first item on this agenda concerns the liquidation of the Armenians. Ittihad will dangle before the Allies a specter of an alleged revolution prepared by the Armenian Dashnak party. Moreover, local incidents of social unrest and acts of Armenian self-defense will deliberately be provoked and inflated and will be used as pretexts to effect the deportations. Once en route, however, the convoys will be attacked and exterminated by Kurdish and Turkish brigands, and in part by gendarmes, who will be instigated for that purpose by Ittihad."" - Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter

In particular, Dreyfus was at that time the only Jewish officer to be recently passed by the General Staff.

Or is my MORE RECENT reuters source not as good as your reuters source?

&gt; And what exactly is my narrative? Why is yours better than mine?

Your narrative is not really your narrative, but the Syrian regimes narrative. That is the Syrian Baathist one family totalitarian state's narrative. So basically your simply take in what their side says add a spin to it and somehow rationalize it to fit in your anti-Western anti-US narrative, I'm assuming in the name of some type of anti-imperialistic non-interventionist goal.

&gt; He's not fighting an internal enemy. He's fighitng the US, Turkey, Israel, France UK, Turkey and a few others. Leave him alone and he'll be fine.

Maybe you should speak with some of the 4-5 million Syrian refugees in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Europe who fled Syria, and ask them who they fled. Vast majority of them fled Assad's scorched earth policy and his forces. Also notice how these refugees are never fleeing to Iran, Russia, etc. 

We will not leave him alone, and he will not be fine. He didn't leave us alone, so we won't leave him alone either. 

&gt; Actually, according to international law no country has the right to attack another country without the UN mandate. Though I give you that South Korea requested the US help. Much like Syria requested the Russian hep.

International law huh? The same international law which failed to prevent the Rwandan genocide. The same international law which failed to prevent the massacres in Yugoslavia. What exactly is international law? I actually look forward to a day where something called international law can exist, but we are not there yet. 

&gt; I think this is our fundamental disagreement. I absolutely abhore one word government.

And I think that we are doomed without it, so we are at an impasse, and the only choice for people with my position is to keep going on the current track and dismantle any hostile attempts at subverting a one world government, using economic, diplomatic, soft power, and occasionally if necessary hard power. Your position would be, I assume to resist, and resist(we are over 90% of the way there btw), thus slowing down the inevitable union of humanity.

&gt; Iranian government is hostile towards the US for a good reason It was the US that pushed Iran right into the hands of the islamic nuts. All for oil. You may know Irans history better than I do, but you have to admit that much.

You are correct that Iran is currently in the hands of Islamic nuts. Don't worry, we will take care of them very soon and remove Iran from the Russian axis. But thank you for your concern for the suffering of Iran under Islamic fundamentalism.

US certainly made mistakes in the past with its policy towards Iran, some of them somewhat justifiable, others just out of incompetence (US is not perfect), but in Iranian people's hearts they are on the side of the US in the long run. We will be past this issue soon enough, and Bashar Al-Assad will have to get his free money from elsewhere.

&gt; Russia was doing pretty well and on the upswing after the drunkard Yeltsin went away. I am of the opinion that the US got pissed of that Puting threw out the so called NGO's and decided to steal for the benefit of Russian oligarchs instead of foreign oligarchs.

I am not going to go too far into Russia's recent history and why it turned out the way it did, but it is going down a dangerous path of repeating something like Germany's ""stab-in-the-back myth"", after WW1. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stab-in-the-back_myth

Russia must accept that it lost the Cold War and stop competing with the West and instead join the West, otherwise something similar to the dissolution of the USSR can happen again for Russia itself. Vladimir Putin says his biggest regret is the dissolution of the USSR, thus implying he wants to put a similar system back together and compete with the West again, i.e. round 2. This will lead to pain for everyone, but more pain for Russia, just as WW2 led to pain for everyone but more pain for Germany.

&gt; Actualy, Russia has much more. Look at the map some day - 1/8 of the planet's land mass. Lots of goodies the West would love to lay their hands on. The nukes is something I'm not happy about when it comes to any country.

1/8 of the planets land mass, and your point is? Btw half that land mass is uninhabitable and frozen and will not be unfrozen for some time, even with global warming. But lets just continue with your logic. 

Russia 1/8 of the planets land mass. USA, Canada, Europe, other US allies, make up how much of the planets land mass? 

USA and Canada by themselves are larger in land mass than Russia, so … 

As far as goodies the West would love to lay their hands on. I don't believe any nation, the USA included should have exclusive rights to the resources in its nation in the future. Once global governance is established we need to get rid of the artificial lines we have created amongst ourselves. Having decentralized one world government is one thing, but having multiple competing systems is not good and will lead to the destruction of humanity. 

Issues like global warming, uncontrolled population growth, dwindling of the planets limited resources can only be solved on a global level, not on a nation by nation level. 

&gt; You are naive believing that Russia and/or China will go down without taing all of us with them. In fact, the other day, that's exactly what the Russians said. Sorry, no link.

We are not going to start a war with them. Most likely scenario will be some type of soft power strategy. Strangle and contain them and they will break from within, even if it takes 200 years. 

&gt; I'm Polish. Poles used Iran's hospitality during WW2.

Yes, this is a great story after WW2 and some of the Poles stayed afterwards, opened schools, and melted into the Iranian society. 

Although, just for your information, this was not initiated by the Iranian government. Iran was invaded by the Soviets and under control of Soviets back then https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Soviet_invasion_of_Iran, and it was them who decided to relocate the Poles to Iran, but Iranian society is very hospitable to guests in general so it was a good choice for them I think.

255,"&gt;So uh.... can someone who actually knows economics tell us if its good or bad to have surplus?

depends.

Everything has downsides and upsides, and the context in which it happens matters a great deal.



Interest 

Or basically how confident can investors be, that the debtor can pay it back.
If the investor confidence is extremely low, a deficit is probably not that great of an idea.
Because the debt will come with political or financial constraints.




Expected future growth.

one of the most obvious ways to reduce your debt is to increase the GDP, If that's unlikely to happen, increasing debt is a probably bad.





How much worth the state is going to get out of issuing bonds.
For example would an increase in in investment lead to more productivity, or just higher prices.

No. Because we had a previous false flag attack in Syria and because the first questions has to be asked: cui bono. It makes zero sense for Assad to use CW in a war that he's winning.

Agreed. And that the major problem. The US is out of control.

Nice trick, but this still isnot enough to bomb a country if there is no proof. The issue is that anything (and I mean ANYTHING) coming from Russian reports is considered a lie in the Western MSM. All it takes is the US saying there was a CW attack and hell breaks loose.

You can still identify with and practice some things from the old culture but your day to day life needs to be primarily in your current culture if not then I would say you are rejecting the culture you currently live in which is not good.

As an example, my first relative to North America arrived in 1738 and I still identify with what is currently the country (it did not exist in 1738 just as the US did not exist) and culture that he came from but by far my loyalty is to the US.  I also identify with several other countries that I know I have ancestors from.   I know that the people currently living in these countries may well not see it this way but they do not decide my identity any more than I decide theirs.  

In terms of the MENA migrants, one basic measure of if they are or are not serious about assimulating should be how they raise their kids.

Now dont get me wrong, I`m not saying that you all should go back there or anything, migration is part of our combined human history but at the same time it puts the ""but my ancestors were forced to flee"" in a different perspective, as the ancestors of greeks had to flee/were displaced before that to make room for your ancestors.

Its a vicious circle and needs to be broken by everyone accepting the status quo and working together to forge bonds and come together, so that you and you family could, if you wanted, return to crete in peace and live there (and greeks could peacefully settle in anatolia etc etc) :)

361,"&gt; No. Because we had a previous false flag attack in Syria and because the first questions has to be asked: cui bono. It makes zero sense for Assad to use CW in a war that he's winning.

Previous false flag in Syria? I disagree with that. If you are referring to the Ghouta chemical attack, that was confirmed by both the UN and OPCW to have been done by the Assad regime. 

Second of all, you seem very sure on something being a false flag, so let me turn it around on you. Show me the proof a false flag occurred. 

The cui bono argument is one of the worst ones. First of all by this logic any time a dictatorship does something like this you could say why would they do that? Second of all, there are very clear benefits to Assad using and normalizing use of chemical weapons. He does not have enough forces to retake the entire country, so occasionally he has to use these terror weapons like sarin, etc. Thus far he has used it many times and gained strategic advantages and remained in power. He just has to keep the use under a certain threshold to prevent a full scale response from the West, which he has effectively done so far.

&gt; Agreed. And that the major problem. The US is out of control.

I disagree. I think the US should intervene even more, and I look forward to the future when North Korea, Venezuela, Syria, and the few remaining dominoes in the way of a one world government are dealt with. I wholeheartedly embrace the concept of a unipolar one world government, as do most great historical figures. 

&gt; Nice trick, but this still isnot enough to bomb a country if there is no proof. The issue is that anything (and I mean ANYTHING) coming from Russian reports is considered a lie in the Western MSM. All it takes is the US saying there was a CW attack and hell breaks loose.

I am asking you what would constitute proof to you and the standards you present are basically impossible to meet, therefore you asking for proof is in bad faith in the first place, since you basically acknowledge beforehand that the proof can not be met. 

&gt; Meanwhile, no action whatsoever on the Rohingya muslim plight. Well, except condemntion. Possibly accompanied by thoughts an prayers. I guess it would be impractical to intorduce democracy to Myanmar to run that pipleline from Qatar to Europe via Myanmar.

What action would you like? What action would you support? We can not intervene everywhere at once. Do you support intervention? Also comparing the Rohingya situation to Syria which is 100 times more severe, drastic, and demanding of attention is ridiculous. You must prioritize your attention.

Traveling around the world and doing my best to try and see through the eyes of different cultures has taught me to appreciate what my grandparents went through when they came over to the US from Europe and had to integrate. 

Of course, it helped that my Swedish grandfather could walk right off the boat onto American soil and see paintings of founding fathers who looked like them, traveling through Asian countries I know that no matter how hard I try to act like a local I'll never really be viewed as a fellow Japanese, Korean, or Chinese.

Likewise many imperial societies like the Mongol Empire instituted diversity policies long before their European contemporaries.Mongol Citizenship was not based on blood, it had freedom of Religion, none ethnic Meritocracy, and Freedom of Trade. 

Examples include Ahmad Fanakati,a persian Muslim who was Minister of Finance under Kublai Khan and Sa'ad al-Dawla, a jewish Turk, who became grand vizier to Arghun Khan.

450,"Nobels are a pretty bad indicator of scientific output in this day and age. They reward science that was done 30 years ago and completely bypass *collaborative science*, which is how most major discoveries are done today. If you really want to engage in a transatlantic fight (a pointless exercise, but one that low-quality journalism loves to report on), then compare the EU and the US. The former produces more papers, and a higher proportion of them ends up being amongst the most cited*. 

Europe really doesn't have any problem with science. The problem, in AI, is basically availability of venture capital, where, for sure, the situation is more favourable in the US, but the idea that scientific research in Europe is miles behind the US is a pure myth.

500,"&gt; Those are all things one cannot foresee. Everyone is going to die. So we should all just end life because....yea.

Nonsense. It is absolutely not ""unforeseeable"" that a kid will have a tough time when its parents aren't ready to raise it, just like the expectation of medical conditions based on certain indicators.

Once a person actually *is* a person we should do everything we can to protect and improve their life. As long as this isn't the case there is no point in taking the risk on the off chance that *maybe* this child will be one of the lucky ones.

Perhaps a compromise could be that the people who so vehemently campaign against abortions are the ones who should be made to care for these children, given how they feel this need to interfere with other peoples' lives ... but given how just last month, Irish authorities have discovered yet another mass grave for the remains of small children that were kept and abused in one of the orphanages run by the Catholic church, I have a feeling that would just make things worse. It's time to end these atrocities.

&gt; The point is letting life live. All this can easily lead to the realization that mentally disabled people are probably mindless as well and why not just end their suffering? Do you know how the holocaust started? Exactly like this.

No, it cannot. Please stop arguing against medical science and trying to paint your political opposition as if they'd be as unable to make the distinction between a grown brain with the necessary connections to actually feel and think and a mindless organism that just started growing as you are.

509,"&gt; What about that perhaps most of the companies established a headquarter in Ireland when it was in did a tax paradise? 

Nope, it has never been a tax haven. having slightly lower tax doesn't make it a haven, other countries having poor tax laws is what allows for companies to funnel their money to actual tax havens like the crown dependencies. 

&gt;Also even if Ireland applied are EU tax laws it not necessarily it enforces them.

Yes it does, unless you have proof to the contrary. You can't just make baseless claims because your completely invented supposition helps your argument.

Except that Ireland has a 6.5% lower corporate tax rate than the UK has.

542,"&gt;Yes, you do seem to be the hypernationalist, because that is a bald-faced lie. You are not saying everyone helped, you are specifically trying to ""out"" the US as having made absolutely no contribution to the war. I'd love to see how much you think the US, presumably being among ""everyone,"" helped, because all you seem to care about is how much they actually didn't.

So, what nation am I hypernationalizing for?

I'd love to see you explain how me saying everyone helped somehow excludes the US.

Anything else than personally soloing the war is exclusion?

&gt;I never said the US won WWII singlehandedly. You are arguing against a claim I have never made in my life, let alone this thread.

Yeah and I never said the earth is flat.

You said that the US joined the war despite having nothing to do with it no?

&gt;For some reason, me saying the US contributed a single benefit to the Allies means that I think the US is the only one that did anything. I cannot imagine why you would interpret my intent this way unless you are a defensive Eurocentrist or a Russian shill. I have no interest in saying America was ""the most important"" in WWII. But you are kidding yourself if you think that US support was trivial or meaningless. That is the only thing I have said, not that the Soviets didn't sacrifice a lot, or that Britain didn't fight bravely, or whatever you are telling yourself I think based on your ridiculous prejudice. America helped you with your Axis problem. I am not expecting anyone to kiss our boots for it, nor do I think America was the single most important contributor against the Nazis, just, you know, acknowledge that it happened.

For some reason, me saying that everyone helped, is interpreted by you as pro-russian propaganda. For what reason I have no idea.

&gt;I take issue with disrespecting dead soldiers who very well might have died fighting the Axis in WWII. 

Except this thread is about mocking the morons who go and fight in the middle east thinking they protect freedom by murdering brown people for oil halfway accross the planet.

Not the ww2 casualties.

Hence the ""Oil"" part of the joke.

Then the US hypernationalists showed up and started saying how the US won ww2.

&gt;Does this offend your sensibilities?
Do you really want to argue to death over this? Is it too much to ask that we agree that the Axis was bad, and that the US was among many countries that bled to stop them?

568,"So when it comes to the Nazis, I see your point. Especially as the years went on, and they were still prosecuting Nazis well after the war was over, like the 95 year old [Nazi Bookkeeper](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-nazi-guard/ex-auschwitz-guard-95-dies-before-conviction-binding-idUSKBN18S4UN) who was declared fit to stand trial and serve time (he ended up dying before his sentence anyway, but whatever). It's so far removed from the Holocaust and the war, that yes, it gets harder to see the truth or determine one's role in the Holocaust.

However, as far your second point, I disagree. They take advantage of Western Ideals because there's no incentive *not* to. In other words, if they have their cultural or religious conflicts/issues in their home country, that's on them. But as soon as they seek refuge in another country, they need to leave that shit at the door so to say. And if they don't? They're going to be sentenced to death or kicked out. No questions asked.

Example, you're from Belgium, so growing up in the West, I'm positive you subscribe to a lot Western ideals and concepts (Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Religion, Equality, Free and open/fair elections etc etc). Let's say for whatever reason, you have to be uprooted and suddenly placed in MENA country. Where their culture says that it's ok to stone gays or throw them off a building because they are an abomination. Or that females are more of less seen as property and deserve rape/sexual assault if they dress a certain way, or don't have permission/male escorts, can't hold office etc.

Would you suddenly abandon your Western Ideals overnight simply because the culture/social norms of this new country says it's ok? I highly doubt it. Just like it's pretty naive to think a simple Integration Course will change all of their minds.

But more importantly, even if you didn't agree with the new culture, you won't *act* against them because of what would happen to you right? If you're gay, you wouldn't go out holding hands with your boyfriend in this new country because you know they'll kill you. If youre a female, you wont go out alone or uncovered because you'll get raped.

So even if you don't agree with the culture, you still abide by it for fear of the consequences. And that's what Europe needs to realize when dealing with Arabs from these places, that's all.

Secondly, it's dangerously naive to think that ""keeping it in living memory"" (whatever that even means) prevents this stuff? 

Do you think that Crostians, Bosniaks and serbs forgot about WWII and that's why the 90s war saw genocides being carried out? That's a ludicrous idea.

While this is true, I see it slightly different. The Nazis decided that Jews, Gypsies, Gays etc were ""undesirables"" and needed to be gone. For no reason at all, but just to serve their twisted ideals. Here, we're talking about a terrorist. Who decided to kill innocent people for the sake of his own radicalized and stupids ideals.

Many people then and even here today probably weren't upset when a lot of Nazis (especially the high ranking officials) were executed after the Nuremberg Trials right? So why not here? You're talking about terrorists who seek to come to Europe and do harm against the people, not just going around and torturing and killing people because you're bored or something.

I'm not for the death penalty in a lot of cases, but this is absolutely one where as /u/i_love_aunt_jackie said, a bullet to the head is cheaper than keeping this human trash alive for 20+ years.

733,"&gt;On that being the fault of private property.

vs

&gt;That's more-or-less my position: if you cannot form a perfect (unexploitable) law, then no law should be passed.

Do you not think using a monopoly position to leverage profit higher than the common good is considered exploiting? Without private property, this profit could not be gained. Hence it has been exploited.

&gt;That's a whole nother can of worms. It has to do with the transfer of political power from rural to urban areas, along with people.

Which is intrinsically related to markets.

&gt;No, it doesn't: it frequently refers to the sex or in some cases race of a person.

I have not heard of this in the case of perpetrators which you seem to be referring to.

764,"&gt; Yeah, that's a similar situation, and I'd say that is a positive statement on how these people feel in the Czech Rep.

Vietnamese are really a perfect group of immigrants for a country like ours. What you described about Sweden largely is the case here as well - people form their social circles in childhood, teenage years and in the case of those going to a Uni, also in their early and mid 20s. After that, they kinda shut themselves and are often unwilling to let new people in their social circle.

So immigrants who come here not as children or students can have it quite hard when meeting Czechs. In the case of other immigrants, this would likely end badly, but the Vietnamese are different. They do not tolerate self-victimization in their communities, they do not tolerate failures or complaining.

So what happened was that the adults came here, took whatever jobs they could, often started to run their own little shops with groceries or other stuff and basically swallowed whatever shit Czech society threw at them. They never complained and just kept working extremely hard, often so hard that they sacrificied a big part of their family lives. Their kids largely grew up with Czech nannies and so ended up speaking better Czech than Vietnamese.

So the lack of integration of adults was compensated by the nearly perfect integration of the children. Vietnamese parents would never tolerate that their kids do bad at school or isolate themselves in the school collective (although they do prefer when they date within their community). They quickly realized that segregation would mean that their kids end up doing the same job as them instead of being doctors, lawyers, teachers or IT professionals and so they did what they could to make that integration easy for them.

The Czech society didn't even have to much, we didn't have to turn the Vietnamese into ethusiastic patriots, we simply had to just allow their children in, which wasn't difficult given that the community meanwhile earned the reputation of being unproblematic. Nowadays Vietnamese kids here are sometimes called 'banana kids', i.e. yellow only on the outside, white (i.e. like us) in the inside.

But unfortunately, not all cultures are as adaptable as them. This isn't meant to be critical of the other immigrant communities, but it simply is the reality that it's not just about the host society's ability to accept new people, it's also about the specific cultural traits of the people coming in.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/8e9ub2/merkel_denounces_new_antisemitism_from_arab/dxu0l6l/,kristynaZ,1524497941

772,"Oh boy did you hit the spot!

I absolutely love when foreigners need 15 seconds to realize the problem we purposely blinded ourselves to.

Yes, every country has their own editions of books which leads to unfair competition since there exists at least three or four editions which are mutually intelligible. Which is of course retarded not only because you have to pay translation but economically unsustainable since i.e. Bosnian edition will always be (due to cheaper production) cheaper than Croatian editions yet available on the same market...

Not to mention that there are some that want ""ex-yugo"" TV shows and films subtitled in Croatian standard while no one calls for subtitling series with heavy local dialects, or how our classics from 500 years ago are published in their original form (which I am all for) while contemporary Serbian/Montenegrin authors are translated to the contemporary Croatian standard. Language puritanism is a disease on common sense.

That is also the reason why in the Bosnian-Croatian-Montenegrin-Serbian language debate the side which claims it's all the same language is right now spearheaded by writers and not linguists (at least not in a sense of visibility in general public). Not for some Yugonostalgic ideology but primarily because of the capitalistic logic since the bigger market could perhaps sustain a local literature market which unsurprisingly isn't flourishing in the modern internet- and anglo-oriented cultural market.

edit disclaimer - but also I'll be first to admit that it's a fucking chore to battle through a Serbian translation of foreign books. The above is primarily focused on local authors and their works which in their original form adds a ""flavour"" that is lost in translations while I'll be first to skip Serbian ""Heri Poter"" translation.",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/8e9r09/households_in_the_eu_spend_over_90_billion_or_11/dxu0no4/,dzungla_zg,1524498004

most credible sources put the deathtoll in the Iraq war as 150,000 to 460,000. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War#Tables

Also The Death toll is one thing, but the population of Iraq has always been larger than Syria. The Iraq war also did not have an adverse effect on the population size due to a combination of military professionalism and the inherent nature of the wars; IE the US was out to keep Iraq and its infrastructure largely intact, while in Syria the civil wars desperate nature called for attacks on infrastructure in order to punish the enemy. This is why Iraqs population kept growing despite the war while Syria has become more deserted. going from 20 to 18 million in 4 year.

 Some people enjoyed a middle-class life and took a loan thinking that they will be able to pay it off. The banks thought so too since they gave them that loan. 

Suddenly, everything blew up, the family that took the loan is either unemployed or with less than half the wages they had before and the loan is still there. They now  struggle to pay off their loan, they try, maybe they make a deal. Nothing comes out of it and suddenly they are also homeless.

I read in english so I don't care... but back in the day I didn't. In fact the first book I ever remember reading as a 6 year old, and which revealed to me the wonder of novels was the newly written first part of Harry Potter given to me as a gift, back then still relatively unknown. 

It was published by Algoritam and bought in their store, the publisher who I mentioned closed down last year . 

Maybe today some 6 year old like me will miss the chance to discover the world of books completely, because today's equivalent of Harry Potter will never get translated in croatian or sold here.

Same in Germany. There are specific groups that are banned, for example the ""White Youth"" of the Blood and Honor network. Apart from these groups that were create to engage in illegal activity, being a Nazi is perfectly legal. There is no thought police. What is illegal is to publicly display Nazi symbols, glorify the Nazi regime or the atrocities of them. Denying these atrocities like Holocaust is also illegal. 

Security at the festival was wearing ""Arische Bruderschaft"" (aryan brotherhood) shirts with two crossed WW2 hand grenades pictured. Someone figured out they are illegal, so the police went on the festival grounds and confiscated the shirts. The ""club"" is now charged with displaying Nazi symbolism.

&gt; Discrimination between ingroups and outgroups is a matter of favoritism towards an ingroup and the absence of equivalent favoritism towards an outgroup.[7] Outgroup derogation is the phenomenon in which an outgroup is perceived as being threatening to the members of an ingroup.[8] This phenomenon often accompanies ingroup favoritism, as it requires one to have an affinity towards their ingroup. Some research suggests that outgroup derogation occurs when an outgroup is perceived as blocking or hindering the goals of an ingroup. It has also been argued that outgroup derogation is a natural consequence of the categorization process.[9]

That's what's wrong.

There is no upside, but a downside, which is racism, discrimination etc. 

Besides, my ingroup is people who have empathy. My outgroup is people like you. Regardless of nationality or race.

In 1990 for example Ireland GDP per capita was roughly half of Finlands, so what exact time frame are we talking here? should we wait another 28 years to grow our economy steadily just to save the massive economies of Europe a few quid?

Also our GDP figures are skewed nowadays because of the companies registered here, you think the average Irishman is nearly twice as rich as a Frenchman? I've lived in both the UK and Ireland recently and they're about on par living standards wise.

&gt; Mahmud al-Naser, a defected Syrian intelligence officer interviewed for this series, said the mukhabarat estimated 20,000 people crossed into Iraq as the U.S. began its attack in March 2003, but most returned immediately after the fall of Baghdad three weeks later.

&gt; But another 5,000 crossed for reasons of religious ideology—and they “are what gave birth to the monster” that now dominates much of Iraq and Syria, said Naser, the former head of political party affairs at the Syrian intelligence station in Ra’s al Ein, in northern Syria.

1191,"Comparative indo Europeanen Linguistics is concerned with reconstructing languages in Europe that were spoken before writing.

What they do is compare the oldest attested form of a couple of languages to see wether they are related and then reconstruct the common ancestor.

The mechanisms that are used are this old attested language, but also articulatory principles. For example in Swedish [k] becomes [ɕ] before front vowels and not the other way around, because of articulatory and biological reasons.

Another thing that makes this *not* pseudo-science is that every sound change that is discovered from the proto-language to the descendant (here: proto-Germanic to Old Norse) is expected to be consistent. If we on the basis of this map say that [e] becomes [jo] or [ja] in Old Norse (which is biologically not that difficult since [e] and [j] are articulated in roughly the same areas) we expect to find this in other words as well, and it turns out we do:

PG: *eka ON:  jak  ”I”

PG: *hertōn ON:  hjarta  ”heart”

It does not, if you can prove that Polish nation or Polish state was complicit you can say it, of course historians and artists are exempted.

&gt;It prompted an international outcry led by Israel and the U.S. that it stifled free speech

Oh gee, I wonder how Israelis would feel if they would hear all the time that they're partially responsible for Holocaust.

&gt; Since then, it’s led to growing fears among the small community of Jews left in Poland that they are under threat.

If not allowing to call victims of Holocaust 'perpetrators'(unless proven that they're in fact perpetrators) is a 'threat' to Jews in Poland I honestly wonder how did Jews around the world survived to this day.

Indeed. Here in Finland, from 1917 to the end of the 1970s, we only apparently had a PM/cabinet/government/administration in power for even a single full 4 year parliamentary term *once* in the 1930s. 

Part or most of that may have to do with presidents having more power before, including the right to unilaterally dissolve parliament, and some of them commonly interfered with parliamentary politics. But it also seems to have been harder to build coalitions.

Starting in the late 80s they're more of a a figurehead, and 1983-2003 saw 5 consecutive governments serving a full term, but no PM was in power for more than 8 years, also no party was the ""PM party"" for more than that.. In 2003 we had one government lose a vote of confidence just over 2 months after being confirmed, with the replacement government servin the rest of the term, and after that, we've so far had 2 instances where the PM and cabinet could have served the two term, but the PM's started playing political tactics, resigning about a year before the next election so their successor could be the ""face"" of the party for some time leading up to the election, plus the resigning PM could secure themselves a nice job elsewhere.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/8e4iew/today_its_the_10th_day_my_armenia_is_protesting/dxtei62/,ohitsasnaake,1524462419

1311,"Err, as popular as the anti-Gandhi circlejerk is on reddit, let's not equate the two.

Gandhi was racist in the early part of his life when he moved to South Africa as a young lawyer. It wasn't only common to be racist towards blacks at that time, but he also came to a country where black people were downtrodden by the white colonisers, which made the black people seem, well, less than impressive. To be fair, the same story was happening almost in every African country. Even so, Gandhi only saw blacks as what they were during British rule, whereas he knew Indians more personally, being one, and remembering the grandeur of the olden days. Kinda like the old saying about judging yourself on your intentions and others by their actions, only the historical version of that. He later changed his opinions on black people as he understood that all the people groaning under the European imperialism were in a way united. 

Churchill on the other hand was an unabashed racist, he had the same hand in the Bengal famine as Stalin did in the Holodomor famine (US and Australia even offered free, no strings attached aid and Churchill refused, despite both countries having ample food). Churchill said many ugly things about Indians and he was also antisemitic too. He equated Jews with Bolshevism and ranted about Russians being conniving Asiatic tricksters. I mean, the guy was literally like Hitler in his prejudices, some of the things he wrote were eerily similar. 

Churchill can rot in hell, if only there was a hell for him. It's a shame that most people in US and Europe still laud him as this and that whilst being all smug about how other people have national heroes that were actually villains.

Still stuck in a bunch of wars, this weeks outlook was grim and it started bad. Unhappy that three-quarters of my army managed to cross their land to help the Kingdom of Poland, the Kings of Austria , Bavaria and Prussia cancelled military accesses to the invading Great Horde, Ottomans and Mamluks, so our armies were stuck in eastern Europe now. We shipped the last one into the Baltic, a testament to our commitment to the defence of the occident.

But it should not be. We chose the right terrain to fight in, but luck was never on our side, the troops faltered faster than reinforcements could fill up the ranks and we were cut off from the homeland for more reinforcements. The enemies were advancing fast, quickly sieging down large swathes of the countryside. beaten back once again with almost no room to spread, the King of Poland looked me in the eye and said ""I'm sorry. I'm going to die and you can't stop this. But I will not let them kill your armies.""

The King of France was moved to tears by this, and the moment the city of Novgorod fell to the Kingdom of Sweden, the King of Poland surrendered to the Muslims. I couldn't save him. But with this, the Great Horde was once again brought from the priced city of Novgorod which they so desperately desire. Now only Sweden remained.

I did not want to fight another Christian, even though he was a Lutheran heretic. Us Europeans are too preoccupied fighting among ourselves and have thus become a dying race. I tried to mediate between the two Kings but the King of Sweden was tired, ^^^Robbie. Tired of foreign Powers always intervening in his wars, he had made it back from the two Islands of Åland and Gotland and saw his chance with the Greatest Powers declaring on the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and it was a good chance, but it should not be this time. He wanted to die with honour, and so we granted him that request.

The last war I was stuck in ended dishonourably. The Mali Empire, who was warleader and had most to gain, sold out our Iberian brothers and gave up their colonies to the other side, ended alliances and allied our enemies! A truly heinous act that shall *NOT* be forgotten! [Actions have consequences!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5d42w4ZcY4)

During this, our scouts reported suspicious movements in the Mediterranean. The Great Egyptian Armada was moving, but it anchored in our former African possession of Sirt, for now. But merchant ships saw things confirming our suspicions and Mamlukean armies were spotted in Tunis. And while we were preparing to siege down Sweden, the Sultan of Tunis declared on the King of Portugal. Our armies movement was suddenly blocked by the Theodoran fort in Viborg, which we promptly laid siege to. Once that was done and the Swedish war come to a sad ending, I sent the armies to Scandinavia to siege down the Theodorian possessions there and kill English rebels in a ride-by, waving Hello to the Stadtholder of the Netherlands who did the same. It took a year to finish the sieges, [Sjaelland](https://youtu.be/bYHn8H9O5Qk) was completely sacked, plundered and devastated but in the meantime, our allies were crumbling. The Muslims had crossed the strait of Gibraltar and were laying siege to Granada! And scouts from the Papal states were reporting a large Ottoman army was moving through Venetian land, closing in on him. We dispatched an army to help in Iberia while the rest were sieging Scandinavia, and lo and behold, fate turned to our side! I heard about a great [naval battle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Battle_of_Lepanto_1571.jpg/1200px-Battle_of_Lepanto_1571.jpg) where the Spanish fleet earned many laurels, but the Muslims still controlled the crossing with Ceuta and Gibraltar. But when our dispatched army arrived and pretended to move on Gibraltar, the Sultan of the Mamluks got scared and ordered them to retreat, so the pretence turned serious and we caught one of their armies and the Grenadine garrison sallied out to help. Victory! The nearby Muslim armies were surprised and didn't dare to cross and help, so we quickly secured Gibraltar as well and with naval superiority established, the way was shut. But there was no time to rest, since the Ottoman army meant Business and was sieging down Italy, bringing the Pope nearly to his knees. The first combined Spanish, French and Provencale relief force was repelled, but then the rest of my army arrived from Scandinavia and we tried again. And the Ottomans were no longer the unrivaled beast they had been in the past, casualties were high on both sides but we had God on our side! We repelled them and drove all but one army further south into Italy, the last one rescued itself into the Balkans. We quickly sieged the beautiful city of Firenze and blocked the path north, where the rest of the Ottoman army had tried to escape. One small detachment of ours arrived a lot earlier than any other friendly army, which got completely wiped out, but they took equal numbers with them and bought enough time for the rest of the Christian forces to arrive and win the day. Meanwhile, the sieges of Firenze and Roma were successful and we had complete access to Italy again. We beat them again in Umbria and Provence dealt the final blow in [Ancona](https://i.imgur.com/kjNdJQeh.jpg). The Ottoman army had been [vanquished!](https://youtu.be/hu1DJdbGZk8) 

After the battle, we found a Turkish diary in the army camp.

&gt; We cannot get out. We cannot get out. They have taken Firenze and Roma. Ufuk and Yildirim and Mustafa fell there bravely while the rest retreated to the Paşa ḳapusı. We are still holding...but hope …Mehmed's party went five days ago but today only four returned. The Po is up to the North of Ancona. The Watchers of the River took Serkan--we cannot get out. The end comes soon. We hear drums, drums in the near. They are coming.

We gave our armies some well-deserved rest and recruited some new Mercenaries, then set out for the Balkans. It went pretty smooth for such a large scale movement and we started sieging several border forts. The Ottomans had raised a new army and the Mamluks had come from Africa to help them out. In an Albanian Mountain fort was the last battle of the war. The enemy fought valiantly, but it was futile, God was on our side. The forts quickly fell thereafter and the Sultan of Tunis was pressured into giving up. There was some confusion in the peace deal but Tunis mostly lost some of the colonies in the New World and some African coast, giving less room for their raiding parties. Sjaelland was sold to England because the King had sold his Heavy ships, his only real defence mechanism, which were crucial in the battle which gave naval superiority.

[Deus Vult! Amen!](https://imgur.com/oQJnk5B)

Peace at last. So thought my King as well and decided to die after all this stress. His daughter's reign was unremarkable as it lasted less than a year before she decided to join her father, [Gaston](https://imgur.com/ayNXg7X). The Pope also decided his time had come and a new Pope was elected, and again France was rewarded for their efforts in the defence of Christendom and nominated Curia controller. With their deaths, we lost the title of Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, but Provence had voted for Poland to become the new one. Rewarding my efforts to help him, he appointed me Elector. Furthermore, he added all his  Provinces to the Holy Roman Empire and became the *first* Emperor to pass an Imperial reform! Now the former Holy Roman Empire is encircled by the new, true to its Name Holy✔️ Roman✔️ Empire✔️

But the peace shouldn't last, our friends in the newly formed [USA](https://youtu.be/U1mlCPMYtPk) were itching for some manifest destiny and we were to gain some stuff from their former masters as well, so we sent an army to the new Continent, which is now named ""America"", to kill some folks.

Meanwhile, rebels seized the opportunity to break free, so Sus became independent of Portugal and Gaeldom became independent of newly formed Great Britain. A race to this new land started, and Tunis declared two wars of aggression, was too slow in Sus and Spain declared a war of aggression as well, we prepared to be called into a defensive war as Sus was to be vassalised but Tunis anticipated this and peaced out. Great Britain tried to avert Gaeldom from falling and sent Condottieri, but lost and now has Muslims on his Island. At least he made Greater Finland (sans Viborg) a thing.

1400,"#5th: the Olmert deal


1 - Olmert didn't give the map to Abbas, pressed him to sign that day without further consultations. 

2 - the right of return: the Palestinians are asking for the people that had their houses inside the borders of Israel to either return there and become Israeli citizens  and get their houses back or be compensated for the loss of their land. this is bad on:

The first formal move towards the recognition of a right of return was in UN General Assembly Resolution 194 passed on 11 December 1948 which provided (Article 11):

&gt;Resolves that the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property which, under principles of international law or in equity, should be made good by the Governments or authorities responsible.


also the negotiations were on going, it was not a final rejection but olmert, the israeli PM resigned because of corruption charges against him 

&gt;Abbas said negotiations continued, but broke down as Olmert’s legal problems worsened. Olmert has since been convicted on bribery and corruption charges and sentenced to more than six years in prison. He is currently free while he appeals.

&gt;Nonetheless, the Palestinian leader described the talks as the most serious negotiations since an interim peace accord was reached in 1993 under then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Two years later, Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish ultranationalist opposed to his peace moves.

&gt;“I feel he [Olmert] was assassinated politically as Rabin was assassinated materially. I feel if we had continued four to five months, we could have concluded the issues,” he said.

About, the Palestinians are  immigrants parts, I take it that you mean **recent** immigrants because otherwise were all immigrants from Africa. This myth was largely spread by ""On From Time Immemorial"" and was debunked by Norman_Finkelstein in his doctoral thesis:




&gt;**On From Time Immemorial**

&gt;In Finkelstein's doctoral thesis, he examined the claims made in Joan Peters's From Time Immemorial, a best-selling book at the time. Peters's ""history and defense"" of Israel deals with the demographic history of Palestine. Demographic studies had tended to assert that the Arab population of Ottoman-controlled Palestine, a 94% majority at the turn of the century, had dwindled towards parity due to massive Zionist immigration. Peters radically challenged this picture by arguing that a substantial part of the Palestinian people were descended from immigrants from other Arab countries from the early 19th century onwards. It followed, for Peters and many of her readers, that the picture of a native Palestinian population overwhelmed by Jewish immigration was little more than propaganda, and that in actuality two almost simultaneous waves of immigration met in what had been a relatively unpopulated land.

&gt;From Time Immemorial had been praised by figures as varied as Barbara Tuchman, Theodore H. White, Elie Wiesel, and Lucy Dawidowicz. Saul Bellow, for one, wrote in a jacket endorsement that: ""Millions of people the world over, smothered by false history and propaganda, will be grateful for this clear account of the origins of the Palestinians.""

&gt;Finkelstein asserted that the book was a ""monumental hoax"".[19] He later opined that, while Peters's book received widespread interest and approval in the United States, a scholarly demonstration of its fraudulence and unreliability aroused little attention:

&gt;&gt;By the end of 1984, From Time Immemorial had...received some two hundred [favorable] notices ... in the United States. The only 'false' notes in this crescendoing chorus of praise were the Journal of Palestine Studies, which ran a highly critical review by Bill Farrell; the small Chicago-based newsweekly In These Times, which published a condensed version of this writer's findings; and Alexander Cockburn, who devoted a series of columns in The Nation exposing the hoax. ... The periodicals in which From Time Immemorial had already been favorably reviewed refused to run any critical correspondence (e.g. The New Republic, The Atlantic Monthly, Commentary). Periodicals that had yet to review the book rejected a manuscript on the subject as of little or no consequence (e.g. The Village Voice, Dissent, The New York Review of Books). Not a single national newspaper or columnist contacted found newsworthy that a best-selling, effusively praised 'study' of the Middle East conflict was a threadbare hoax.[20]

&gt;...

&gt;In 1986, the New York Review of Books published Yehoshua Porath's review[22] and an exchange with critics of the review[23] in which he criticized the assumptions and evidence on which Peters's thesis relied, thus lending independent support from an expert in Palestinian demographics to Finkelstein's doctoral critique

1403,"So let me get this straight - you actually believe that Generalplan Ost didn’t specifically call for the extermination of all Jews in Europe? 

&gt;	After the Madagascar solution fell through, there were preliminary plans to send the Jews to Palestine and Siberia.

None of this is relevant given what actually happened. Because it was proposed at one point does not mean anything. Germany never intended to be in Siberia, and Palestine was a long shot that never would have worked, and it doesn’t matter because the actual actions ended in planning the extermination of 75% of Poles, 100% of Jews, 100% of Roma, and 100% of Lithuanians. That’s not the proposal, those are the actions they took. 

&gt;	Shitty logistics was also one of failures Germany repeated from WW1.

Germany’s actual logistic system in World War I was fine, it was the allied blockade that caused issues. 

&gt;	100k or so dead Haitians never happened, huh? It was like 1/4:th of their entire population at the time. Your excuses for Napoleon being his fanboy are exactly like some holocaust denier’s equivalence in the case of being a Hitler fanboy. The irony really escapes you, and I suggest you check what this thread is about again.

Please source the claim that the population of Haiti was 400,000 in 1800. The amount of French colonists killed by the Haitians was itself around 25,000, and that doesn’t include soldiers (around 75,000 casualties.) It’s funny though because most consider the massacre of the French and Creoles to be the genocide committed in Haiti. Maybe the french would have tried to ethnically cleanse the island had they won, but they didn’t.

Comparing Napoleon to Hitler is fucking stupid and doing so reflects your own lack of historical awareness, and completely downplays the holocaust.

1407,"&gt; Ireland is a net contributor to the budget yes, but the main increase is benefit to europe is the increased trade and imports of goods ireland can now achieve with the rest of europe, benefitting everyone. 

Meh, barely. If you weren't making money off attracting Apple, Google and whatnot with shady deals, they'd be in other countries where their presence would increase wealth there and allow for even more purchasing power and trading. The wealth from jobs created by multinationals wouldn't disappear, it would just move. Plus we could properly tax them too.

In practice it's a bit more complicated than that for reasons such as the poor tending to spend more when given purchasing power than those who are already rich and other stuff, but overall, I highly doubt this makes a significant difference.

&gt; In terms of scandinavia, they didnt have outside interference (namely UK) until very recently, as well as having a quarter of their land occupied.

That's certainly true but let's face it, in the last few decades, Ireland hasn't been suffering from outside interference or anything: if you wanted to make money off an industry and a serious service economy, nothing's been preventing you recently. You just find it easier to leech off the rest of the Union rather than actually build an economy that actually creates wealth of and on its own.

&gt; none of those economies are even close to western european levels so its not like you can say, ""hey look these guys did it!"". 

They *are* doing it. You've been part of the western block since as long as there have been two blocks, you've been a fully independant country for about 70 years, and you've been in the EU since the 70s. They've been actually independant countries and left the sovietic block for less than 30 years and in the EU for 10 to 15 years. And their GDP has already skyrocketed. Romania's GDP per inhabitant has been multiplied by 6 between 2000 and 2008. Estonia's been multiplied by 4.5 in the same time period. They are not there yet obviously, but they are getting closer. Even despite the 2008 crisis which significantly hindered their growth, the gap between them and us has been lowering. Give them time, they *will* make it. Fortunately for them, in fact, because as I said, there can't be infinite tax havens. And the spot's already taken apparently. 

By the way, this should make you think twice... if being a tax haven is the only way to develop for a poor small country, why would we let *you* keep the spot which you no longer need, when some other countries need it so much more?",,/r/europe/comments/8dwb8y/lets_play_spot_the_tax_haven/dxt2uqk/,JeSuisLaPenseeUnique,1524447138

We ""Annexed"" India in 1851 after the east india company had successfully corned the economy and all other empires in the region (eg. the Mughal empire) had collapsed, then, after a large scale mutiny in a few cities, the british government decided the east india company was causing too much shit so they took over directly, to the betterment of the indians in the state, since direct rule ended up being considerably better (apart from WW2) than prior ultra lasseiz faire capitalist rule (which was the primary cause of the famines and so on in india under british rule).

Ireland was a similair situation where numerous problems ended up causing yet another famine in Ireland (they werent rare at all), and the government responded very poorly (since a liberal party got into power, which thought that if the market cant fix it, it aint broke). Turns out the market caused part of the problem in the first place. Although there were slaves in india (which had been there long before we got there), they didnt play a role at all in 1851, as the mutiny was suppressed by a combination of british and native indian troops.

Slaves were already banned ""in ireland"" since it was UK soil, where non-penal slavery had been banned for quite a while longer (as a criminal you could still be shipped to a penal colony somewhere though that was relatively rare), from 1772 infact, one of the earlier dates for abolition in europe.

1522,"&gt; Ireland is a net contributer to the EU budget. If the tax schemes were not in place that would not be the case. 

Ireland offers a net contribution of around 100 Million Euros, while losing everyone (including themselves) dozens of billions of taxes on multinationals like Google or Apple... that's like emptying your friend's fridge and saying ""heh, I'm no leecher, I brought you a candy"".

&gt; Your countries have had an economic infrastructure and high standards of living for hundreds of years now, ireland does not have the time to create this naturally, especially considering nearly every country is western europe bumped their economies through colonialism and theft of other countries resources.

Scandinavia successfully did, among others. Sweden was so poor in the early 20th century that something like 1/3rd of the population fled to countries like the US. And Finland was basically worser-Sweden for most of its history. Sound economical policies, the built of an industry and then of a service economy, led to considerable results without resorting to being a tax haven, nor to colonizing Africa.

The same can be said of much of Eastern Europe, which not that long ago were puppet-states of the USSR, and were dirt-poor too. Kids were literally starving in the streets in Romania not that long ago (25 years maybe). Yet these countries currently undergoing a steady growth and see a massive improvement of their standard of living, without resorting to being tax havens, nor to colonization.

As for draining EU resources, to be honest, Ireland did it for about 40 years and only became a very small net contributor for 3 years...

Now, yes, I know, you're not connected to Mainland Europe, and that's a disadvantage. But various other countries have it tough for various reasons. Eastern-Europe was on the other side of the Iron curtain and was left in ruins a mere 30 years ago, Germany and, to a lesser extent, France and the UK had to be rebuilt twice in the second half of the 20th century, Finland was stuck against Russia, with its only land connection to the western block, via Lapland, not to mention non-EU countries like Iceland, a territory mostly made of ice with nearly no tree lost in the middle of the ocean, with 300k inhabitants, that succeeded in having a super high quality of life without resorting to being a tax haven...

There is absolutely no necessity of being a tax haven to develop oneself as a country. It's just the easy way out. It's easy money and being formerly poor is no excuse. If you're going to play against the rest of the EU rather than in collaboration with them, I wish the rest of the Union would have the balls to show you the exit.",,/r/europe/comments/8dwb8y/lets_play_spot_the_tax_haven/dxswxii/,JeSuisLaPenseeUnique,1524440259

&gt;that famous bearskin, every hair of which-the Assistant &gt;Predestinator

&gt;had a helicopter accident, fell on his head. Thump! what a twinge 
&gt;through the forehead! A chorus of ow's and aie's went up from the 
&gt;audience. 

&gt;The concussion knocked all the negro's conditioning into a cocked &gt;hat. 
&gt;He developed for the Beta blonde an exclusive and maniacal &gt;passion. 
&gt;She protested. He persisted. There were struggles, pursuits, an &gt;assault 
&gt;on a rival, finally a sensational kidnapping. The Beta blond was &gt;rav- 
&gt;ished away into the sky and kept there, hovering, for three weeks &gt;in a 
&gt;wildly anti-social tete-a-tete with the black madman. Finally, after &gt;a 
&gt;whole series of adventures and much aerial acrobacy three &gt;handsome 
&gt;young Alphas succeeded in rescuing her. The negro was packed off &gt;to 
&gt;an Adult Re-conditioning Centre and the film ended happily and &gt;deco-

1647,"&gt; Brussels wants to end the practice of distributing cohesion money almost exclusively on the basis of gross domestic product per head, replacing it with much broader criteria covering everything from youth unemployment, education and the environment to migration and innovation.

In what way? If you have e.g. shitty education system, you'll be rewarded with funds, so it would actually motivate countries to make their education system shittier? Or the other way around?

&gt; But diplomats and officials expect the outcome to be a redirection of funds from Poland, the Czech Republic and Baltic states towards southern states such as Italy, Spain, Greece and even some regions of France.

As opposed to e.g. Portugal, Romania or Bulgaria, who would need them much more? How would that even be fair? And for France, I hope these are not some colonialism leftovers somewhere in Africa or Americas. Also, Greece has been, I think, the highest receiver per capita of all times. I'm not sure if I would invest even more money there...

&gt; Angela Merkel of Germany and Emmanuel Macron of France have backed the idea of using the EU budget to provide financial support to regions hosting large numbers of asylum seekers, such as Germany and Sweden.

So paying money on the basis of taking in more foreigners. It's like they're doing the most opposite thing possible compared to what you'd expect from a **European** Union, quite frankly preferring foreigners over Europeans. 

&gt; EU officials are also revising the rules around the requirements for member states to match EU funding, which would require some member states to use more national money in projects. The commission has described the step as helping to “increase the sense of ownership in the policy”.

1658,"What do you mean by this, 20-25% by which year? Going off of [this research](http://www.pewforum.org/2017/11/29/europes-growing-muslim-population/) we can see that the current ratio of Muslims in the EU28+CH+NO is 4.9% and even with the ""high"" projection that they're using, which would assume that the peak of the migrant crisis in 2015 continues indefinitely we'd be looking at 14.0% of Muslims in Europe by 2050. Now I'd wager that's extremely unlikely at best after the EU-Turkey deal was signed ([or even regardless of the deal](https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/research-subject-groups/centre-criminology/centreborder-criminologies/blog/2016/09/fact-check-did-eu)) with the growth rate of immigration being steadily negative compared to the very stable growth it was experiencing coming up to the crisis itself. 

If we look at the zero-migration projection which implies complete prevention of any further migration of specifically Muslim immigrants, we're looking at 7.4% Muslim population in 2050 due to the currently [increased birthrate among Muslims in Europe](http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/04/04170947/FT_17.04.05_projectionsUpdate_fertilityRegion310px.png) compared to the average. The medium projection implies the steady levels of migration continuing and projects a 11.2% Muslim population by 2050 so that's the difference we're looking at between the two policies.

The further forward we go the more unreliable the projections will be, birth rates [tend to drop](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4255510/) as countries develop so we'd have to see how that effect takes place with an immigrated Muslim population in developed EU countries.

There are issues that we need to think about and address for sure but we keep portraying the problem as something that will completely destroy the union. One of the areas we need to focus on is the better integration of the European Muslim population in society, something that stigmatizing that group is certainly not helping with, as well as trying to work on stabilizing the regions that most Muslim immigrants and refugees arrive from which is obviously the largest cause for increased migration. As for the birthrates, most denominations seem to have birthrates [just above replacement level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_population_growth#Europe) (2.1) in Europe so I guess the real issue is getting non-Muslim Europeans to go back up to that.",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/8e43rl/hitlers_only_kidding_about_the_antisemitism_new/dxsq9qr/,0Hellspawn0,1524432910

There is no way that others will agree to the idea of receiving less funds due to it being put towards asylum seekers.

I'm all for helping Greece and Italy out and basing it on factors such as unemployment. I imagine that means Croatia will get some extra funding too?

&gt; On top of revising the allocation of funds, the commission is reinforcing conditions on eligibility, including rule of law compliance, and applying more restrictions on how the EU money can be used.

It's all very interesting. Expanding the tools available to them to make sure it is spent properly would be more than welcome, especially when Timmermans told us that we might have to pay more.

1876,"&gt;That quote is nowhere in the Wikipedia article about his book. I'm seriously starting to wonder if you're trolling.

It's in the Wikipedia of Solzhenitsyn himself.

&gt;He pulled them from KGB archives, which he later had access to

As such, he is a bad source, I stand by my point. You should go check out actual historians because it is common sense nowadays that the numbers he cited are massively inflated and also, something you've yet to address, he's an antisemite. Check out *Two Hundred Years Together* where he makes up weird shit about Jews. I'm going to quote Austin Murphy's *The Triumph of Evil* which uses most available sources to compute the total number of people executed under Stalin:

&gt;The claim that Stalin and other Soviet leaders killed millions (Con-
quest, 1990) also appears to be wildly exaggerated. More recent evi-
dence from the Soviet archives opened up by the anticommunist Yeltsin 
government indicate that the total number of death sentences (includ-
ing of both existing prisoners and those outside captivity) over the 
1921-1953 interval (covering the period of Stalin's partial and complete 
rule) was between 775,866 and 786,098 (Getty, Rittersporn, and Zems-
kov, 1993). Given that the archive data originates from anti-Stalin (and 
even anticommunist) sources, it is extremely unlikely that they underes-
timate the true number (Thurston, 1996). In addition, the Soviet Union 
has long admitted to executing at least 1 2,733 people between 1917 and 
1921, mostly during the Foreign Interventionist Civil War of 191 8-22, 
although it is possible that as many as 40,000 more may have been 
executed unofficially (Andics, 1 969). These data would seem to imply 
about 800,000 executions. 
The figure of 800,000 may greatly overestimate the number of actual 
executions, as it includes many who were sentenced to death but who 
were not actually caught or who had their sentences reduced (Getty, Rit-
tersporn, and Zemskov, 1993). In fact, Vinton ( 1993) has provided evi-
dence indicating that the number of executions was significantly below 
the number of civilian prisoners sentenced to death in the Soviet Union, 
with only 7305 executions in a sample of 1 1 ,000 prisoners authorized 
to be executed in 1940 (or scarcely 600/o ). 
In addition, most (68 1 ,692) of the 780,000 or so death sentences  
&gt;passed under Stalin were issued during the 1 937-38 period (Getty, Rit-
terspom, and Zemskov, 1 993), when Soviet paranoia about foreign 
subversion reached its zenith due to a 1 936 alliance between Nazi 
Germany and fascist Japan that was specifically directed against the 
Soviet Union (Manning, 1 993) and due to a public 1936 resolution by 
a group of influential anti-Stalin foreigners (the Fourth International 
which was allied with the popular but exiled Russian dissident Leo 
Trotsky) advocating the overthrow of the Soviet government by illegal 
means (Glotzer, 1 968). Stalin initially set a cap of 1 86,500 imprison-
ments and 72,950 death penalties for a 1 937 special operation to combat 
this threat that was to be carried out by local 3-man tribunals called 
''troikas"" (Getty, Ritterspom, and Zemskov, 1993). As the tribunals 
passed death sentences before the accused had even been arrested, local 
authorities requested increases in their own quotas (Knight, 1993), and 
there was an official request in 1 938 for a doubling of the amount of 
prisoner transport that had been initially requisitioned to carry out the 
original campaign ""quotas"" of the tribunals (Getty, Ritterspom, and 
Zemskov, 1993). However, even if there had been twice as many actual 
• executions as originally planned, the number would still be less than 
1 50,000. Many of those sentenced by the tribunals may have escaped 
capture, and many more may have had their death sentence refused or 
revoked by higher authorities before arrest/execution could take place, 
especially since Stalin later realized that excesses had been committed 
in the 1937-38 period, had a number of convictions overturned, and had 
many of the responsible local leaders punished (Thurston, 1996). 
Soviet records indicate only about 300,000 actual arrests for anti-
Soviet activities or political crimes during this 193 7-3 8 interval (Davies, 
1997). With a ratio of 1 execution for every 3 arrests as originally speci-
fied by Stalin, that figure would imply about 1 00,000 executions. Since 
some of the people sentenced to death may have already been in con-
finement, and since there is some evidence of a 50,000 increase in the 
total number of deaths in labor camps over the 1 937-38 interval that 
was probably caused by such executions (Getty, Ritterspom, and Zem-
skov, 1993), the total number executed by the troika campaign would 
probably be around 1 50,000. There were also 30,5 14 death sentences 
pas�ed by military courts and 4387 by regular courts during the 1937-38 
J)enod, but, even if all these death sentences were carried out, the total number remains under 200,000. Such a ""low"" number seems especially 
likely given the fact that aggregate death rates (from all causes) through-
out the Soviet Union were actually lower in 1 937-38 than in prior years 
(Wheatcroft, 1 993). 
Assuming the remaining I 00,000 or so death sentences passed in the 
other years of Stalin's reign (i.e., 1 921-36 and 1 939-53) resulted in a 
60% execution rate, as per the Vinton (1993) sample, the total number 
executed by Stalin's Soviet Union would be about 250,000. Even with 
the thousands executed between 1917 and 1 921, it is plausible that the 
number of unarmed civilians killed between 1917-1953 amounted to 
considerably less than a quarter mil lion given that thousands of these 
victims may have been Soviet soldiers (Freeze, 1 997), given that some 
may have been armed bandits and guerrillas (Getty, 1 985), and given 
that at least 1 4,000 of the actual executions were of foreign POWs 
(Vinton, 1 993). A USA former attache to the Soviet Union, George 
Kennan, has stated that the number executed was real ly only in the tens 
of thousands (Smith, 2000), and so it is very likely that the true number 
of unarmed civilians killed by the Soviet Union over its entire history 
(including the thousands killed in Afghanistan more recently) is too 
small for the country to make the top ten in mass murders.

This far below the millions and millions Solzhenitsyn claims to be executed which can't be true by any metric. When it comes to GULag:

&gt;Like the myths of millions of executions, the fairy tales that Stalin 
had tens of millions of people arrested and permanently thrown into 
prison or labor camps to die in the 1 930-53 interval (Conquest, 1990) 
appear to be untrue. In particular, the Soviet archives indicate that the 
number of people in Soviet prisons, gulags, and labor camps in the 
1 930s, 1 940s, and 1 950s averaged about 2 million, of whom 20-40% 
were released each year, (Getty, Rittersporn, and Zemskov, 1 993). This 
average, which includes desperate World War II years, is similar to the 
number imprisoned in the USA in the 1 990s (Catalinotto, 1 998a) and is 
only slightly higher as a percentage of the population. 
It should also be noted that the annual death rate for the Soviet  
&gt;interned population was about 4%, which incorporates the effect of 
prisoner executions (Getty, Rittersporn, and Zemskov, 1 993). Exclud-
ing the desperate World War II years, the death rate in the Soviet pris-
ons, gulags, and labor camps was only 2.5% (Getty, Ritterspom, and 
Zemskov, 1.993), which is even below that of the average ""free"" citizen 
in capitalist Russia under the czar in peacetime in 1913 (Wheatcroft, 
1993). This finding is not very surprising, given that about 1/3 of the 
confined people were not even required to work (Bacon, 1 994), and 
given that the maximum work week was 84 hours in even the harshest 
Soviet labor camps during the most desperate wartime years (Rummel, 
1990). The latter maximum (and unusual) work week actually_ com-
pares favorably to the 1 00-hour work weeks that existed even for ""free"" 
6-year old children during peacetime in the capitalist industrial revolu-
tion (Marx and Engels, 1 988b ), although it may seem high compared 
to the 7 -hour day worked by the typical Soviet citizen under Stalin 
(Davies, 1 997). 
In addition, it should also be mentioned that most of the arrests under 
Stalin were motivated by an attempt to stamp out civil crimes such as 
banditry, theft, misuse of public office for personal gain, smuggling, and 
swindles, with less than 1 0% of the arrests during Stalin's rule being for 
political reasons or secret police matters (Getty, Ritterspom, and Zem-
skov, 1 993). The Soviet archives reveal a great deal more political dis-
sent permitted in Stalin's Soviet Union (including a widespread amount 
of criticism of individual government policies and local leaders) than is 
normally perceived in the West (Davies, 1 997). Given that the regular 
police, the political or secret police, prison guards, some national guard 
troops, and fire fighters (who were in the same ministry as the police) 
comprised scarcely 0.2% of the Soviet population under Stalin (Thur-
ston, 1996), severe repression would have been impossible even if the 
Soviet Union had wanted to exercise it. In comparison, the USA today 
has many times more police as a percentage of the population (about 
1%�, not to mention prison guards, national guard troops, and fire fight-
ers mcluded in the numbers used to compute the far smaller 0.2% ratio 
for the Soviet Union.

1. Vozlibre.com? I have never heard of this site. Is there a reason why you can't share any reliable source? Here at the article they don't show any proof (they actually show the opposite, a Spanish flag in the Camp Nou). And they only talk about what a single one Atlético de Madrid fan named Fernando Santiago explained about it...

2. BeSoccer.com? Never heard of this site also. But they don't mention anything about Spanish flags being prohibited here. You shared a wrong source again...

3. LaRazon.es. This is the only somehow ""reliable"" source you could find? For those that doesn't know La Razon I'm gonna copy this from Wikipedia: its political alignment is conservatism, Catholicism, Spanish nationalism, Right wing and Monarchism. Having said that, the article doesn't show any proof. And they, guess what, talk about the exactly same fan as your first source did: Fernando Santiago! Also, reading the article I see they talk about one of Fernando's friends named ""Arcadi Espada"", which is a pretty well known Spanish nationalist...

I see you Googled ""*bandera españa prohibida Camp Nou*"" and that's all you could find. Because that's the same links that appear to me. Think about it for a second and be honest with yourself. Don't you really see that if Spanish flags were ever prohibited in Camp Nou, every single Spanish media would report it? It would be on the cover of every Spanish newspaper. Not just on some fringe nationalist media talking about the same guy...

&gt; PS. This thread uses Tele Sur as a source and you constantly use sources such as VilaWeb which are on pair with Intereconomia when it comes to being biased, yet just you guys cry over this.

You can absolutely see it that way, or you can see it as being a general reluctance to accept the rewriting by the Finnish nationalism that started during Russian rule.

Whatever remained after that is just remains of something that was, but is no longer.

1950,"&gt; "" The first large-scale successful deployment of chemical weapons was by the German Empire in Ypres, Belgium in 1915, when chlorine gas was released as part of a German attack at the Battle of Gravenstafel. Following this, a chemical arms race began, with the United Kingdom, Russia, Austria-Hungary, the United States, and Italy joining France and Germany in the use of chemical weapons. This resulted in the development of a range of horrific chemicals affecting lungs, skin, or eyes. Some were intended to be lethal on the battlefield, like hydrogen cyanide, and efficient methods of deploying agents were invented. At least 124,000 tons were produced during the war. In 1918, about one grenade out of three was filled with dangerous chemical agents. Around 1.3 million casualties of the conflict were attributed to the use of gas and the psychological effect on troops may have had a much greater effect.[5] As protective equipment developed, the technology to destroy such equipment also became a part of the arms race. The use of deadly poison gas was not only limited to combatants in the front but also civilians as nearby civilian towns were at risk from winds blowing the poison gases through. Civilians living in towns rarely had any warning systems about the dangers of poison gas as well as not having access to effective gas masks. The use of chemical weapons employed by both sides had inflicted an estimated 100,000-260,000 civilian casualties during the conflict. Tens of thousands of more (along with military personnel) died from scarring of the lungs, skin damage, and cerebral damage in the years after the conflict ended. In the year 1920 alone, over 40,000 civilians and 20,000 military personnel died from the chemical weapons effects""

2007,"honestly, most of those grievances are self inflicted.

germany and france arent perfect but they are in general welcoming, and have a much larger population, and not as homogenous as Poland.
if you dont experience other cultures and peoples, you will in general be closeminded.
and you can point to a couple of anti semitic attacks in Berlin or Paris, but the same can be said for Poland, even more so for Muslims.
lets not kid ourselves man.

i would not want to visit Poland ever again, im tinted skin colour and im afraid ill be attacked for it.
there is damn near a new article every month about a xenophonic attack in Poland. or how the far right hijacked a rally a few months back, that was a symptom, racists came out the woodworks because they had PiS now.

and on press freedom.
https://rsf.org/en/poland
thats a very reputable site.

https://rsf.org/en/ranking/2015
and in 2015, Poland was ranked 18th.
and on nord stream, why shouldnt Germany have its way? its in the best interest of its people, why should it care about Polands feelings if Poland does the same thing and blame Germany for everything?
if Nord stream is good for Germany and bad for Poland, who cares.

PiS is using the Polish public, they scare monger about the other and vilify the very union that helped rebuild Poland, the EU.
with billions of our tax money going towards Poland, and in return we get a slap across the face for it.
Poles arent understanding that they are burning bridges, our far right hates them and our moderates dont like them anymore, and this is coming from someone that used to like Poland.

all the while Poland and Poles get more out of the EU than any other country.
millions have moved out west, and none of us were asked if we wanted millions of EE amongst us in the decade to follow.

and of course there should be no repercussions for being shat on, its just words, why? do you want to jail people for using harsh rhetoric about Poles?
retribution of some kind?

heres the thing, the logic you are using about refugees, the exact same logic can be used against EE and Poles as well. dont you find that hypocritical?, and when i say i want less Poles and most deported, im polonophobic or something, even though we havent recovered from the massive spike in crime from 2004, when Poles immigrated.

i dont want people in my country that dont share the same liberal values.
that goes for everyone, refugees included.
but when i say that about Poles, im racist, but when its targeted towards Muslims, its okay.

and yes, Brexit was in large part caused by Poles.
nearly 800k of them in the UK now.
and the british dont want them there anymore or no more in, and i dont blame them, i want the same for NL. if Poles can have that stance on refugees and migrants, Poles shouldnt blame me for not wanting them in NL either.
whats good for the goose is good for the gander.

which is why im leaning towards voting for PVV or FvD the upcoming election.
i want Polands funds cut significantly, and stricter immigration laws on EE.
their voting rights ended and sanctions placed.
but that will most likely never happen, unless Orban leaves office.
the EU is far too meak and complacent, it should be harsher, strict guidelines should be followed when you join the EU, and when you deviate, as Poland is doing now. automatic expulsion should take place.
Poland is acting like a dick, because it knows it can get away with it, and im getting sick of it, same goes for Hungary.

and this is me airing my grievances as well.

2048,"&gt; Having virtually everyone on the continent die of disease puts a bit of a damper on historiography.


Unfortunately, it wasn't just disease but also systematic destruction of the cultures and civilizations Europeans encountered in the Americas. When I read about the exploits of the British and Spanish invaders sometimes I wonder why they aren't considered often enough on the same level as Nazi Germany or Stalin's USSR. 



Yes, the German and Soviet efficiency of exterminating people was much ""better"". but the goal was the same. Given the technoligies available to the colonists, the genocide they perpetrated was no less ""impressive"".


Luckilly, some of the pre-Columbian history still survives for those who are interested. Heck, I am amazed even by the earliets Europen settlements. Sure, they are not as old as oldest European settlements. 


I live in Canada now. Well over 20 years ago I discoverd a few graves of the very first colonists in the area where I live. Dates on the graves were from eary 1700's and, all things considered, I was as amazed having realized what I was looking at, as I was when I realized that a small river I took a piss into in Southern France was spanned by a Roman bridge from 1st century AD. The bridge was properly marked. The graves were hidden among overgrown weed and brush. Only a few years ago these graves were given proper care and marked as a historic site.

Having visted the Smithsonian in the States, I would have to diagree. America had a history before 1600.... Most of the people's involved however have long since died out. European settlers arrived at the end of a sort of Mad Max apocalypse of native societies thanks to disease. And then set out to 'civilise' them..... 

Modern American history is so sterile because it's so oversimplified into one long founding myth by popular culture. 

&gt;Rome was the epicenter of the Universe for so long, and to crumble and whither is both fascinating and terrifying

There are as of yet unknown documents about the dividend tax, Ministry refuses to release them

During last year's cabinet formation, documents were drafted about the controversial abolition of the dividend tax. The Ministry of Finance refuses to disclose these documents. Publication, according to the department, would ""detract from the protection of the necessary confidentiality"" of the formation [of the current government]. In addition, it could lead to confidence in the government coalition ""coming under pressure.""

The existence of the documents came to light due to the rejection of a request from two UvA [University of Amsterdam] researchers, to which Trouw writes Friday. They appealed to the Government Information (Public Access) Act (Wob), but [the ministry of] Finance said no.

Prime Minister Rutte and the coalition party chairmen have previously stated that they have ""no recollection"" of documents about the dividend tax during the formation. Now that there are documents to be found, the opposition wants these to be made public as soon as possible. GroenLinks, SP and PvdA in particular have criticized the abolition of the dividend tax, which now gives the Treasury 1.4 billion euros annually.

ChristenUnie leader Gert Jan Segers maintains ""in honor and conscience"" that he can remember ""no documents"". According to him, the documents that Finance writes about could have been used when discussing taxes ""on a seperate table."" [as in not prominently discussed in the formation]

2184,"&gt; I don’t see how that is successful given that Hitler’s genocide ended... However calling him successful in Haiti is *ridiculous* and *disingenuous* for *whichever reason* you choose... Furthermore comparing Napoleon and Hitler is a *fucking stupid*... *insult* to the memory... *mah holocaust* 

Sorry about triggering you, but you pretty much answer your fit of rage yourself:

&gt; If your reasoning is that people still like Napoleon as a person, it’s because Haiti was a tragically minor footnote in the long and complex history of Napoleon... It *was not Napoleon’s* objective to kill all blacks over the age of 12, *but Leclerc’s*

Do you *really* think Nazis and the German population were like ""let's gas all the jews in concentration camps, all Hail Hitler"", or even by some simple command directly from Hitler? No, they were shipping Jews out of sight and extermination camps were something top secret and originally intended to be temporary storage facilities.

Finding someone else to blame for it in a similar, which wouldn't even be difficult; so let's say: *It wasn't Hitler objective to kill the Jews at extermination camps, it was Himmler's.* It's not even far from the truth, since the original plan was to send them to *somewhere else*, which ended up being more of an NIMBY thing in Europe, and since Madagascar wasn't in anyone significant's backyard, it could have been one of the options for the Final Solution if there wasn't a naval blockage preventing Germany from going through with it. Also, if they had successfully had conquered Russia, designating an area in Siberia for relocation of Jews would have been another proposed Final Solution.

I'm sure if the situation ended in another way, or if their target was something like Haitians instead of Jews. Likewise, if they'd really gone through with extermination as primary objective in let's say the early 1930s, and hidden the evidence well instead of being discovered in mid 1940s by their enemies, the propagandistic aftermath reaction would have been vastly different.

A footnote about the *successfulness* is that success here is how much they lost for their objective and how things turned out in the vilification afterwards.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/8du00j/i_got_this_remindme_bot_reminder_today_be_careful/dxrwin7/,hajamieli,1524397229

2217,"It's not about a low fertility rate, it's about a significant decrease of the fertility rate, e.g. One-Child-Policy in China. 

A drop in fertility rate is the foundation for economic growth in a developing nation, because the government can spend money on the quality of infrastructure instead of the quantity. Education can be improved on all levels(Primary, Secondary, Tertiary), thus eventually reaching the quality of more developed nations. 

Singapore, South Korea, Japan all reaped huge profits from their demographic development. A lot of countries of the former Soviet Union reap profits of a drop in fertility rates today. The fertility rates droped in a large manner in the 90s. Nowadays, the government is not forced to spend large sums of money for their children, they can instead focus on improving their economy and improving their tertiary education.

&gt; But in practise, a country like Nigeria can't control the amount of kids their women get even if they wanted to.

You're wrong. Bangladesh is a prime example of a country lowering their fertility rate on purpose. They went from a fertility rate of 6,5 in 1980 to 2,14 in 2016. ",,/r/europe/comments/8dsxw7/romania_was_the_fastestgrowing_european_country/dxrtgno/,regdayrf2,1524389491

It's how we roll over here. It's how our free press rolls. And I'm glad they do.

So I chuckled when I heard him say it :)

I myself don't really mind it when reporters look for the edges, especially when they piss off autocrats. I don't mind when some of 'm are rude at times. Especially since some politicians these days can be very rude themselves as well. I don't want *all* of my news shows to be like this, but they aren't. Most of 'm operate in a more respectful and neutral manner.

The guest on the show was Judith Sargentini, Dutch MEP for [The Greens](https://www.greens-efa.eu/en/), who authored the [report](https://www.euractiv.com/section/future-eu/news/parliament-draft-report-calls-for-infringement-procedure-against-hungary/) to start an article 7 procedure against Orbán's Hungary.


&gt;The Hungarian ambassador is disgusted by my statement about his great leader Viktor Orbán at Dr. Kelder &amp; Co and demands 'disciplinary measures' against the undersigned at the NPO Pfff Dear Mr. Kocsis, this is where freedom of expression offers space.

And what 'disciplinary measures' would those be? Sack him? Silence him? 

No, Mr. Ambassador. We will *not* allow you to control our media [like you do in your own country](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-protest/tens-of-thousands-of-hungarians-protest-against-pm-orbans-rule-idUSKBN1HS0KN). You can, with all due respect, go fuck yourself.

This is *exactly* what I mean when I say that Orban's Hungary poses a threat to other member states when they shit on EU values like a free press. It *will* affect other countries. And it seems now they're even actively trying to silence media in other countries, as is demonstrated by the Ambassador. And even though the remark might be offensive to some, it is *not* a reason for 'disciplinary measures'.

There *are* reasons for disciplinary measures, like slander or threatening people, but this isn't one of them.

Smit's [statement](https://www.nporadio1.nl/homepage/9161-hongaarse-ambassade-walgt-van-provocatie) (loosely translated):

&gt; Smit is worried about free press in Hungary. He calls his own remark provocative. ""It was meant that way. The fact that the ambassador is demanding for disciplinary measures against me personally, shows exacty what is wrong with the Hungarian interpretation of free speech and shows why free press and democracy are under serious attack over there.""

With all due respect, fuck your authoritarianism, Mr Ambassador. Keep it to your own country. We will *never* allow your autocratic rule to silence our media.

You can´t actually write portuguese well enough can you? You claim to be an expert on something, to know a place, but you are not comfortable enough with the language to actually use it.  And your perspective seems to be of a tourist.

&gt;Blaming foreigners for Portuguese drug consumption is whack, we’ve always consumed drugs and a fair amount too. 

If you know Portugal you know how stuff was 20-25 years ago.  And you know how much it changed since then. You knew the places you could not go to, you had the streets where there were syringes on the ground, where people were selling openly. And it changed incredibly much in the past 20-25 years. so take a look at the data here

2411,"&gt;What has happened in Hungary since 2010 offers an example—and a blueprint for would-be strongmen. Hungary is a member state of the European Union and a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights. It has elections and uncensored internet. Yet Hungary is ceasing to be a free country.

&gt;The transition has been nonviolent, often not even very dramatic. Opponents of the regime are not murdered or imprisoned, although many are harassed with building inspections and tax audits. If they work for the government, or for a company susceptible to government pressure, they risk their jobs by speaking out. Nonetheless, they are free to emigrate anytime they like. Those with money can even take it with them. Day in and day out, the regime works more through inducements than through intimidation. The courts are packed, and forgiving of the regime’s allies. Friends of the government win state contracts at high prices and borrow on easy terms from the central bank. Those on the inside grow rich by favoritism; those on the outside suffer from the general deterioration of the economy. As one shrewd observer told me on a recent visit, “The benefit of controlling a modern state is less the power to persecute the innocent, more the power to protect the guilty.”

&gt;Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s rule over Hungary does depend on elections. These remain open and more or less free—at least in the sense that ballots are counted accurately. Yet they are not quite fair. Electoral rules favor incumbent power-holders in ways both obvious and subtle. Independent media lose advertising under government pressure; government allies own more and more media outlets each year. The government sustains support even in the face of bad news by artfully generating an endless sequence of controversies that leave culturally conservative Hungarians feeling misunderstood and victimized by liberals, foreigners, and Jews.

No and they shouldn't. They only consider like-for-like comparisons. A bus ride in one country should only be compared with a bus ride in another. Though in reality, it never gets that specific. 

Instead they tend to look at larger aggregates such as ""public transportation"". Some countries have tram networks even in middle-tier cities, others have large metro systems and some have not. Different cities in different countries have different transportation strategies. It's about looking at a broad swathe of this and making an aggregate and systematic comparison.

If that ""fuck you"" factor didn't exist, I would think that Rubio or Cruz would have won the Republican primaries then and try to win the POTUS elections by playing the latino catholic card.  Likely losing. This is sadly how elections in the US work (and elsewhere to different extents). Policy is also sometimes dictated by elections, hence why Republicans have a hard stance on Cuba - because that gets them &gt;50% of Cuban voters in the swing state of Florida (in comparison to &lt;30% they get across all latino groups in the US).

A different view on that would be (without the condescending ""like children"" part) that the DEMs alienated their voters so hard from their policy that some voters were willing to do that (vote Trump). The DEMs also alienated the Bernie voters into not-voting all together. Using your parlance, they threw a hissy fit and didn't participate at all then. Masses of people are in fact at the same mental level as children.


Also, my Trump comment was a flame remark to a different poster because I perceived his way of thinking to be idiotic. Stooping to fascism insults if you are anti-immigration or some other issue is also a trend in Europe (Germany especially), and had the exact same results as in the US. AfD at 13% in Germany yay. They are pretty much a single-issue party and if only a centre-left party would decide to go anti-immigration but yay all the other liberal stuff - they would probably beat both the SPD and AfD in the next elections in Germany.


&gt; I'm not the person you replied to originally. It's just something that comes up every time that someone ""on the left"" (ie everyone not extreme right nowadays) is disagreeable someone says ""this is why Trump won"".

My mistake, both names start with a G so I assumed.

You shouldnt be jealous...there is a place and a time.

Given what you visited, I suggest to complete the Mediterranean area, so Greece, Spain, Portugal, France. After go full ""Mitteleuropa"", so France again, Germany, Poland up to Sweden, Finland, Eesti, Lithuania and go little down till Romania and Croatia (just to name the bigger) and at the end (just cuz you are N American) the U.K.

A last spot for me, in my (hypothetical) Grand Tour of Europe, could be the N African coasts and Turkey (basically, East Mediterranean).

He also straight out lied about Jews being in the Soviet leadership because he was a fucking antisemite and a fascist sympathizer, two things you conveniently ignore.

Again, Versailles did not force Germans to turn to anti semitism and go and murder 11 million people (plus starting the war). France was occupied by Prussia, had its land annexed, was forced to pay huge reparations despite the damage they suffered, and somehow the French people did not feel the need to invade their neighbors and go around exterminating people. Not to mention the Germans imposed an extremely harsh treaty on Russia during WW1 (Brest Litowsk) yet they bitched about Versailles that only made them surrender lands they took from Poland, France and Denmark in wars of conquest. Marshal Foch was right, France should have made Versailles even more strict not less.

2564,"&gt;I agree there is culpability on the Horthy government, hence why I literally said it. I am also claiming that this was a strategic move to appease the Nazis and avoid the fates of other countries like Czecholoslovakia before and Yugoslavia later. All these countries were playing guessing games and were trying to maneuver the political landscape. Not allying with Germany meant a certain coup against them and a Reichskommissariat-esque government. The game plan for both the pre-coup Yugoslav royals and their supporters and the Romanians was staying with the Axis until they get beaten back. The Romanians did exactly that and Yugoslavia saw a coup against the Royals at the start.

My issue is that Hungary and the other ones weren't only trying to maneuver between Nazi Germany and the USSR, it is that they deeply sympathized with the Nazis on other facets. The Numerus Clausas was in 1920 and that was enacted by Horthy to limit the numbers of Jews that could attend university. You can find a lot of anti-Semitic rhetoric before 1938. Not only that, Hungary was the first European country to institute such a restriction and it was one of the first acts of his government. 

EDIT: Oh and I forgot how easily pressured he was. First he was pressured by Hitler to do the deportations, and then he stopped them following pressure by people like the King of Sweden. He only got couped by Germany during his plans to surrender. 

&gt;He did publicly declare himself an anti-semite in 1940. His actions during his reign though, make a clear distinction between him and the Nazis. This might have been influenced by the fact that Hungary had so many Jews, that losing them would have put a far too large economic/demographic/socio dent into the country. Also be aware that we are talking about the 1930s and 1940s. Xenophobia wasn't an evil exception, it was the grim norm.

Well yes, the biggest distinction is that he was one of the nicer ones among the fascists with Mussolini and Salazar. That is really faint praise. He still spoke like an anti-Semite and acted like one when he had the chance. My issue here isn't trying portraying Horthy as a Nazi or as uniquely evil, it is putting Horthy's only in context of Nazi Germany, when there is plenty to show there wasn't much disagreement between the two nations until it was clear that the Nazis were going to lose. 

&gt;You have mixed up your histories. He was taken prisoner and sent to Bavaria which was Allied territory. What Stalin did do in support of Horthy, was blocked the Hungarian communist government from putting him on trial after the war. We are not talking about Nuremberg here, we are talking about post-WW2 death squad trials against non-communist leadership.

And then he was finally saved by John Montgomery and Stalin's word mattered, especially due to Stalin's sympathy for Horthy's pathetic (the fucking Nazis discovered it, the people with the worst intelligence gathering of all time) attempt at switching sides when defeat was clear. It had little to do with a witch-hunt on anti-communists (a huge chunk of them were indeed deeply involved in crimes), if anything anti-communism saved him. 

&gt;Tito was a Croat. This wasn't ethnic cleansing. It was a genocide on political grounds.

&gt;The people that got killed after the Brits turned them away were ""Domobrani"" (which were akin to a defensive Wehrmacht), Ustashes (a more cruel and less efficient version of the Waffen SS) and civilians that accompanied them due to fear/family reasons/anti-communism.

Of course, I never intended to claim otherwise. Tito was also part Slovene, and himself a different force from the Croatian Army which got slaughtered there. PS, please do not mistake this as tears for Croatian Army, because I find it hard to sympathize even for the civilians after the severity of the crimes of the Ustaze.  

&gt;Yet again. I have mentioned the massacres. What happened in Vojvodina wasn't nowhere near the level of what you are implicitly equating with the actual Holocaust. There is a lot of complexity in this matter (due to guerrilla warfare/partisans) that you are either avoiding due to ignorance or propaganda. Hungary had a hand in the killings of more than just ""Gendarme"" in Vojvodina. There are plenty of examples of these ""complexities"" like with the Novi Sad raid in 1942 where Hungarian troops killed 3000-4000 people (this includes combatants, ""suspicious invdividuals"" and jews). Though then the Hungarian government sentenced the commanders to death. But then they escaped to Germany, most likely with support by some in the government.

Which is a lot of words distracting from Horthy approving the crime, and why he did such an investigation which was mostly to distinguish his regime from Germany's. Forgive me if I find the honesty in it lacking. 

&gt;I have sourced multiple claims I have made, in previous posts. I have explained the context and I have mentioned the exact instances where wrong doing was apparent. 

Except all that context left out the context that Horthy overall didn't mind Hitler on many levels. 

&gt;You and the OP poster, threw a lot of falsehoods, ad hominem insults and little to no exact information.

Pray tell, what falsehoods, ad hominen insults (my insults are pretty in subject) and little information?

&gt;You have stayed away from any precise information because you either don't possess the knowledge or the will to post them.

Oh really? 

&gt;You certainly are not willing to address clear issues with your narrative and have shown a very child like understanding of how geopolitics work.

I understand how geopolitics work, what irks me deeply is apologism disguised as ""geopolitics"" that hides actual ideological intentions.

&gt;To you guys, it only matters what Horthy thought about Hitler or what Hitler thought about dogs and completely ignore everything else including the rational decision making of these individuals. 

If there was any rational decision done by Hungary ever since its revolution then that is truly lost by me, because all I see is a never ending farce. 

Oh and what people think of other leaders and their ideology doesn't matter? MY GOD THIS IS TRULY A TWIST 

&gt;It is frightening that you are (probably) elligible to vote.

OH NOES GOD SAVE US

&gt;I am just irked by people that hide their ignorance behind sweeping statements

Speaking of irksome, you know what is irksome? Whitewashing a dictator who allied with Hitler who wasn't ideologically even far away from Hitler himself simply because he wasn't as violent, insane and brutal as Hitler, Tizo, Pavelic and Antonescu were the moment the Final Solution was announced.

That's a fairly predictable spike for an economy as small and globally exposed overall as Ireland's. Remember, the GDP of the entire country is only $334 billion. The following year, an aircraft leasing company relocated to Ireland and the GDP jumped 26% (of which about 7% was ""organic"" domestic growth - still strong recovery figures) as a result, simply as a result of the volume of revenue now being booked in Ireland (but still taxed elsewhere, you morons - learn how the Irish tax system works).

Apple payed tax in Ireland on it's Irish sales. The rest of Europe's sales are owed to where they're headquartered - the United States. Whether they pay the US is the US's business. The revenues were still registered in Ireland, but the Irish rules say they're only interested in Irish figures. That wasn't ""special treatment"" as alleged in the politically weaponized competition ruling. Every multinational here is treated precisely the same way.

Ireland is one of the only countries to make direct legislative changes to combat tax evasion. There is not, nor has there ever been a large corporate tax evasion scheme which involved Ireland, which didn't depend on loopholes which existed in other jurisdictions (actual tax havens like the Crown Dependencies). The best they could ever hope for in attempting to ""tax launder"" their funds in Ireland - was 12.5% or very close to it.

You morons should be delighted that those funds are being domiciled in Ireland. YOUR COUNTRIES STILL COLLECT THE TAX ON IT. But Ireland's required contribution to the EU goes up as a result - the money never touches the Irish economy, but we pay more to the bloc for it.

P.S. Nothing in the Irish tax system is in violation of any existing EU rule, period. The right of Ireland to set our own tax rates was also affirmed in the Lisbon Treaty, following ratification in Ireland. No change to the rules allowing countries to set their own tax rates is likely to pass in the medium term, nor should it. We have the right to choose to have an attractive base for business to operate (as do you, you simply choose not to). There are sacrifices that entails, but the benefits to our society have been enormous. We do not apologize for it. We do not owe you anything for it. You post-imperial colonizing powers have NO moral high ground to dictate to us about it.

2592,"I know your feel and you are mainly right. I also think that it is a bit misleading, I am pretty sure that many people say now that they voted on Fidesz just to go with the winners. Actually many people vote on Fidesz simply because they are the strongest party. Many people don't understand the principle of democracy and they just want to win and nothing else. Voting on the lesser evil is as bad as anything else. You still have the right to do an invalid vote or not vote at all. you don't have to vote on Fidesz just because you don't want for example Jobbik to lead the nation.

Also I am afraid that the opposing parties are as important part of Fidesz system (NER) as Fidesz and Orbán themselves. Opposing parties are also not for us but for their money from the parliament.

That is actually the best output I hope from these demonstrations: people start to talk with each other, start to concentrate on real problems and hopefully a real opposing party grows out from these demonstrations.

The problem is that as long as so many people fears Orbán I am afraid that there won't be change. I live now in Budapest but grown up in a small town. There it was basically told in school for parents and teachers that either they vote on Fidesz or they do bad for the children. Some parents didn't go with it, started to rage about it and others called them Soros soldiers who are against their own child. Same goes with all ""közmunkás"" (workers who got their job from the government) there, they were actually sure that as long as there are not enough vote for Fidesz in the town they will be fired so they agitated everyone to vote to Fidesz.

So another thing I hope from these demonstrations that it will start to spread the word that there is no reason to fear from Fidesz and Orbán, they are just as strong as strong is the fear from them and the fear from giving the country to an even worse opposing party.

As long as these two things happen (a real alternative grows up and people stop fearing from Orbán) I still see a good future for our country.",,/r/europe/comments/8dxf03/another_saturday_another_demonstration_with_tens/dxrksn0/,orikalcooo,1524371816

Apple payed tax in Ireland on it's Irish sales. The rest of Europe's sales are owed to where they're headquartered - the United States. Whether they pay the US is the US's business.

You morons should be delighted that those funds are being domiciled in Ireland. YOUR COUNTRIES STILL COLLECT THE TAX ON IT. But Ireland's required contribution to the EU goes up as a result - the money never touches the Irish economy, but we pay more to the bloc for it.

P.S. Nothing in the Irish tax system is in violation of any existing EU rule, period. The right of Ireland to set our own tax rates was also affirmed in the Lisbon Treaty, following ratification in Ireland. No change to the rules allowing countries to set their own tax rates is likely to pass in the medium term, nor should it.

The police have been particularly successful in combating burglary. The number has fallen nationwide by 23 percent to 116,540 cases.

Austria is close enough to Germany that it basically gets spillover benefits from the giant market right next door. Same with Denmark. The Baltics compete through cheaper labor which is every bit as much a race to the bottom as tax competition and bad for the average person in the eu in the long term. Finland has not being doing great for the past decade precisely because they're a small peripheral country in a currency union with the giant that is Germany while Sweden has avoided that by keeping their own currency that is far lower valued than the euro. All the smaller countries in the eu are the same: they get the proximity to the big boys benefit, compete with price of labor or tax policy or currency difference, or a combination of these. The best for the Irish people of those options available to them is tax policy and it isn't any worse for the rest of the eu than the others.

So yes, the country did end up on the German side, but that only became clear after seeing the fate country could suffer with the Anschluss. Despite this, when the prime minister at the time, Imrédy, wanted to push the country further into totalitarianism, Horthy replaced him.

That doesn't make any sense. Denmark will get VAT from the sale and any associated taxes from the shop that sells it, anything else doesn't work. Lets simplify things a little and pretend that Apple is a 100% Irish company and iPhones are designed and manufactured in Ireland, lets also say they don't directly sell their phones in Denmark. If 2nd company came along and decided it was going to then import iPhones into Denmark and sell them in its own shops, does that then entitle Denmark to tax Apple, even though Apple has nothing to do with Denmark? No, Denmark can tax the company that imports the phones. At the same time Ireland isn't entitled to any of Lego's profits just because you can buy Lego in Ireland.

IMHO our - Polish - history about Holocaust on the level of newspapers is spoken and written by people that support claims of controversial 'historian' like Gross.  
It has nothing to do with the real science based on sources.   
IMHO people like Gross and producent of the controversial movie are trying to write history that is based on 'believes', 'metaphores' and not on facts that can be proven.  
It's like comparing haggada or fairy tales to the real science IMHO.   
Anyone that is not supporter of these stories that unambiguously and without any doubt support it  is considered as fascist, nazist, far-right etc.

Germany is the single most destructive country to the european project currently, I never denied that. But it's not due to nord-stream, the entire nord-stream debate is somewhat of a shitshow full of propaganda from both sides (not that there isn't a discussion to be had, I've just seen little good discussion on it). The real reason Germany is so destructive to the european project is due to wage surpression and austerity which is absolutely destructive to the european south and is probably the single biggest threat to the EU falling apart. In comparisson any possible debate over nord-stream is a drop on a hot stone.

&gt; than some legal tax optimization that was corrected almost 3 years ago....

No, the Irish government did next to nothing to collect the tax fine.

- the government mainly operates with fear and hatred, they say that the opposing parties are pure evil working with George Soros on the destruction of Hungary. Because of this people in Hungary became really malevolent with each other.
- they can push their hatred thanks to they own nearly the whole media through oligarchs and most people on the rural areas have information only through this media. Those people basically think that if anyone else than the current government wins there'll be instantly millions of immigrants everywhere who will rape or women, ruin or churches, etc... Also many of them think that they'll be deported to Siberia. I am not lying.
- the government got absolute power during a former election which they used to create a system that favors them everywhere. The whole electoral system and the borders of the electoral zones were also optimized for them. They also put their people to everywhere, basically every position (main public prosecutor, president, leaders of media authority, etc, etc...) is their. You simply cannot fight against them through law since the public prosecutor (ex member of Fidesz) skips every case related to Fidesz. A simple example from today. The Court of Auditors just penalized all opposing parties with some pretty random reasons. The only party that wasn't penalized (and for the record wasn't even investigated whether they should be penalized or not) is Fidesz.
- and the election let's say wasn't the clearest one for sure. It is basically proven (and not penalized by the Fidesz owned National Election Office) that many people from neighbor countries got Hungarian citizenship and different allowances/pensions from our tax for their vote. Fidesz simply opened many otherwise unopened borders, people came in by foot or with cars/buses, voted then went back home. There are many houses or even stables or empty parcels where on paper tens or even hundreds of people live. They are all from a neighbor country and coming to Hungary only to vote. Of course you can say that in that case we should make some accusations and it'll be solved. But again, these accusations are handled by Fidesz owned organizations. And as soon as you don't do what you have to you are fired. There are many stories about people who went to demonstrations like this and lost their job.

Basically our country starts to be a really, really shitty place and Fidesz made such rules and organizations that this won't really change if we say that ""hey, we can vote in every 4 years, so we have democracy!"". Fidesz won really big 8 years ago and won also 4 years ago but there weren't any demonstration about it.

2928,"Let me copy some bullet points from one of my comments to point out why people start to feel that having an election in every 4 years does not mean having democracy.

- the government mainly operates with fear and hatred, they say that the opposing parties are pure evil working with George Soros on the destruction of Hungary. Because of this people in Hungary became really malevolent with each other.
- they can push their hatred thanks to they own nearly the whole media through oligarchs and most people on the rural areas have information only through this media. Those people basically think that if anyone else than the current government wins there'll be instantly millions of immigrants everywhere who will rape or women, ruin or churches, etc... Also many of them think that they'll be deported to Siberia. I am not lying.
- the government got absolute power during a former election which they used to create a system that favors them everywhere. The whole electoral system and the borders of the electoral zones were also optimized for them. They also put their people to everywhere, basically every position (main public prosecutor, president, leaders of media authority, etc, etc...) is their. You simply cannot fight against them through law since the public prosecutor (ex member of Fidesz) skips every case related to Fidesz. A simple example from today. The Court of Auditors just penalized all opposing parties with some pretty random reasons. The only party that wasn't penalized (and for the record wasn't even investigated whether they should be penalized or not) is Fidesz.
- and the election let's say wasn't the clearest one for sure. It is basically proven (and not penalized by the Fidesz owned National Election Office) that many people from neighbor countries got Hungarian citizenship and different allowances/pensions from our tax for their vote. Fidesz simply opened many otherwise unopened borders, people came in by foot or with cars/buses, voted then went back home. There are many houses or even stables or empty parcels where on paper tens or even hundreds of people live. They are all from a neighbor country and coming to Hungary only to vote. Of course you can say that in that case we should make some accusations and it'll be solved. But again, these accusations are handled by Fidesz owned organizations. And as soon as you don't do what you have to you are fired. There are many stories about people who went to demonstrations like this and lost their job.

Basically our country starts to be a really, really shitty place and Fidesz made such rules and organizations that this won't really change if we say that ""hey, we can vote in every 4 years, so we have democracy!"". Fidesz won really big 8 years ago and won also 4 years ago but there weren't any demonstration about it. Now more and more people see that this is only a storefront democracy but in reality Fidesz owns here everything, even ""democracy"".",,/r/europe/comments/8dxf03/another_saturday_another_demonstration_with_tens/dxqttak/,orikalcooo,1524339231

That is an absurd analogy considering 80% of Ireland's corporate tax comes from multinationals, most of which not originary from Ireland. 

&gt;If you believe in capitalism and free competition you should praise what Ireland has managed to do and try to copy it, learn from it.

You're still obnoxious to the point that this works because Ireland is a small country with barely any big companies of its own.

&gt;But you can't, or won't so you complain, say it's cheating. Poor form.

Exactly, we can't because Spain has x10 the population of Ireland and actually has big corporations of it's own, the kind of companies that end up using Ireland as a tax heaven. If we did it we'd loose a fuckton of money. ",Katalonia ,/r/europe/comments/8dwb8y/lets_play_spot_the_tax_haven/dxquj7m/,KatalanMarshall,1524340022

3089,"&gt;Yes but we didn't abandon the countries that we formed a union with

What are you referring to here? The EU hasn't faced any real threat that is remotely comparable to ww2. And the refugee crisis was pretty much ignited by Germany inviting everyone in, Hungary and Poland and Greece weren't exactly happy about that. What country are you from anyway? 

We didn't ""sell out half of Europe"" to ""keep our hands clean"". In case you forgot, ww1 was also a thing and nobody wanted to repeat that slaughter, not to mention that the British economy wasn't exactly stellar in the 1930s and we still had to undergo rearmament. You do know that rebuilding an army isn't something you do overnight, right? And that convincing people to fight another war less than 20 years after the last one (which killed 700,000+) is a bit difficult. 

You are the one who brought up ww2 when we were discussing illegal immigration. So tell me, do not ignore this question here, why did you bring up 1939 when we were discussing border control? 


&gt;everytime shit hits the fan the Brits abandon European mainland 


Right. Like I mentioned earlier, we abandoned Europe in ww1 which is why 700,000 Brits died in Flanders and France huh. And then another 400,000 died in ww2, landing on Normandy, fighting through Belgium and the Netherlands and northern Germany and Denmark and Greece and Italy... right. Explain to me what you are referring to be ""abandoning the European mainland"" here. Are you going to ignore this question too?

&gt;you can act like your economy is still worth anything 

Again, hysterical. You know that 2.7 trillion dollars didn't just vanish, right? You people act as if without the EU economies literally wouldnt exist. Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Canada, etc. These are minuscule nations population wise, their economies are smaller than the British economy, but they are not burning down and living in mud huts. 


Honest question, when you picture people entering the UK illegally, are you picturing an armada of rafts landing in Dover or something? Because that isn't a thing. Effective border controls absolutely can stop illegal immigration, especially as an island with a natural moat. This isn't even related to the EU or Brexit, it's simply acknowledging the fact that border control isn't some impossibility and we should just give up on it (like I said before, just because crime happens doesn't suddenly mean we should give up on enforcing the law....)


&gt;you're just hiding away like you always do

Did you really learn this just now? (Almost) Nobody does communism anymore because the fantasy didn't work, the revolutions didn't happen (which should have been unavoidable in Marx' idea), and when people like Lenin tried to force it via small elites leading revolutions, they (sometimes more, sometimes less) involuntarily created autocratic regimes.

3192,"&gt;Finland-Soviet Russia border

&gt;After Finland became independent in 1917, there was the Finnish Civil War in 1918, and even after this war, the Russian Civil War continued. Finnish activists often crossed the border into Soviet territory in order to fight in the ""heimosodat"", wars aiming at Finnish ethnic self-determination and possible annexation into Finland. However, this came to an end in 1920, when the Russian/Finnish Treaty of Tartu in 1920 defined Finland as independent and demarcated the countries' common border. However, Finnish fighters would still take part in the East Karelian uprising and Soviet–Finnish conflict of 1921–22. Finally, the Finnish government closed the border from the volunteers and food and munitions shipments in 1922.

&gt;Changes to borders with World War II

&gt;During World War II, Stalin severely suppressed the native Finnish-speaking population (Ingrian Finns) by population transfers, collectivization and purges, such that border zones were to be free of Finnish peoples.

&gt;The land border was later demarcated in the Treaty of Paris (1947) following the Continuation War (1941–44), in which Finnish Karelia, including Finland's second-largest city Vyborg, parts of Salla and Petsamo were ceded to the Soviet Union. The new border cut through Finnish territory proper, severing many rail lines and isolating many Karelian towns from Finland. The Soviet Union demanded emptying the territories first. Finns were evacuated from the area and resettled elsewhere in Finland; almost nobody was willing to stay. The areas were resettled by Soviet immigrants. The Porkkala naval base was leased by the Soviet Union, but returned to the Finnish government in 1956. The naval border was established in 1940 and more accurately defined in 1965.

&gt;The border is uncontroversial and clearly defined by law.[8] Both states verified the inviolability of borders and territorial integrity in the first Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in 1975.

I fail to see the issue, that's the thing.

&gt;It's not about homosexuality itself necessarily, but the public display of it. There's tons of various sexual deviations. Take coprophilia for example, the sexual fascination with feces. Is it just as disgusting as homosexuality? Sure. But is it a political problem? Nope, not at all. And the reason is that you don't have coprophils marching on the streets demanding ""equal rights"" and claiming there's nothing wrong and degenerate about their mode of behavior, like you have with homosexuals.

Well, this is a falacy, because why is it also not equally disgusting for fat people to show signs of affection? Also, having gay sex in public is just as illegal as it is *any* type of sex, so it is not at all displayed.

What makes you believe it is disgusting is your own thing so I won't get into it. However, I do not see how two dudes kissing or holdings hands somehow compares to *someone playing with feces* in public.

3253,"Any gambling game without real money involved. It's still the exact same game working off of the exact same psychological effects and urges, but since it doesn't involve real money nobody cares.

Most video game mechanics that have random drops (loot) work based off of the same methods as well. Games like Diablo 2 or Destiny. Imagine a slot machine: you pull the lever, the slots spin and you get a random result. In Diablo 2 ""pulling the lever"" is killing a boss (mostly trivial) and the random results are the random loot drops. Most are trash, some are exceedingly good.

These types of games (there are very many of them) make use of similar things in how our brain works to get us excited about the game, but because they don't allow you to spend real money we treat it as completely different. If we're worried about gambling addiction, then we probably shouldn't treat it as completely different.

&gt; You can argue that this is the wrong choice, but every country has the right, so it's a moot point to argue.

Of course - we are discussing fairness of this decision - and yes every country has a right to reject you for whatever reason, but you open yourself for criticism if the reason is stupid. And thats what people are doing. Nobody is suing France or something like that.

Based on this ""handshake test"" - ""show me your body in bikini test"" or ""drink a glass of vine test"" would makes sense. right?

3341,"Only when you take its peak in 2014 into account. Even then, it's only a fourfold increase from 500$ in 2001 to 1800$ in 2014. The numbers are in relation to the GDP/capita in the entirety of Sub-Sahara Africa.

This is mereley the outcome of technological progress. Telecommunications infrastructure in Africa is decent, thus the economy improves a tiny bit. The flow of information has increased. 

We've seen similar developments in the 70s. The GDP/capita went from 200$ in 1971 to 700$ in 1980 only to fall back to 480$ in 1985. Today's development is similar, it went from 500$ in 2001 to 1800$ in 2014 only to fall back to 1450$ in 2016. 

As long as the population growth in Africa stays the same, a sustainable economic development will not take place. The economy is always tied to human knowledge and productivity. If you can't educate your population in a proper way, your GDP/capita won't increase above a certain threshold. A country with Africa's population growth can only spend money for the quantity of their infrastructure, instead of the quality. 

Taking into account, that changes in demographics have a delayed impact on the economy, we will not see huge economic growth in Africa within the next decades. The positive impact of China's One-child policy influenced the world economy with a delay of 20 years. 

Within 16 years, GDP/capita has increased 8 times from 1000$ in 2000 to 8000$ in 2016. There's nothing as important for developing nations as demographics. 

Although China's economy developed at a fast pace from 1980-2000, you have to take into account, that the first steps are always easy. It's easy to go from 200$ GDP/capita to 1000$ GDP/capita, while it's difficult to go from 50.000$ GDP/capita to 100.000$ GDP/capita",,/r/europe/comments/8dsxw7/romania_was_the_fastestgrowing_european_country/dxq7sh6/,regdayrf2,1524310653

3343,"And killing people is legal as well, as long as it's just yourself. Equal marriage activists aren't advocating to be able to marry in any capacity, they're advocating for *same-sex marriage*. 

&gt;I have nothing against same sex couples

That's often something people say to attempt to premptively shield themselves from negative responses to their insulting assertions, int he same vein of ""*I'm not racist, but gypsies are XYZ*, *I'm not islamaphobic, but Muslims are XYZ*. It wouldn't be a necessary preface in such comments, if those comments were not unkind.

Its further evident by the tacit comparison your inclusion of gay-marriage activism to be comparable to bestiality, and pedophilia. I guess that means you have nothing against pedophilia and bestiality?

&gt;this is not about giving rights (possibilities), but changing the definition of marriage.

It is literally about giving rights, extending rights of marriage of opposite-sex couples to same-sex couples, as we can all agree that marriage is no longer an issue solely in the domain of religion but also controlled by the State, which has a responsibility to treat its citizens and families non-discriminatorily. If that requires a reevaluation of a definition, then so be it, since, it would just the 1000th or so time such a phenomeon has been redefined. After all, [we don't require raped virgins to marry their rapists](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Deut%2022.28-29) anymore. The concept of marriage has been both [expanded to allow for multiple concurrent marriages](http://biblehub.com/genesis/4-19.htm) and in other places it has restricted it to single ones. [Marriage could extend over a person's entire life](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A2&amp;version=KJV), or now be finished in divorce. Marriage also used to [require the wife to die and follow her husband in death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_\(practice\)), until that definition was stopped and changed. 

Marriage has always been changing to conform to the values of the period. And in this modern, contemporary period, we see marriage as a union of consenting people to show the strength of their bond to society, to strengthen that ordered, equal, respectful society. Same-sex marriage is a reflection of those values of respect and equality.

3362,"Having spent several years working in Galileo programme, the European Space Agency and other associated industry/stakeholders what I came to learn pre and post Brexit is:

1. Regardless of how inefficient, wasteful and poorly executed the Galileo programme sill continue at the taxpayers expense. EU taxpayers have no choice but to pay and unlike national taxation and spending the Galileo budget is not democratic (your local national election has no impact) and is not nearly as accountable.This is well understood by all partners which in turn contributes to the inefficiency of the programme.

2. If widget X needs to be made and 4 member countries are able to do it each of them will fight, squabble, wheel and deal to try and get it made in their country even if a clearly more capable and affordable solution exists in another country. This makes everything take far longer and reduces the overall quality. Don't forget point 1 above.

3. There is no customer base. The entire project is being built around the fact that the USA ""might"" deny access to GPS. The exact conditions under which the entire of NATO and many other nations would be denied civilian access remain extreme. To the point which not having GPS would be a rather small issue. The ESA need to convince the vast majority of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) using or goods manufacturing to produce/use items that are capable of using both GPS+Galileo.  There are clear advantages in using Galileo in terms of secure signal through the encrypted PRS signal.

4. The EU/ESA has been incredibly childish in how it has handled the UK space industry and UK Space Agency (UKSA) since Brexit. Funding for research has been cut with no alternative capability offered in the EU, contracts have been given to more expensive and less capable companies with clearly inferior products, access to bidding has been greatly limited. The EU/ESA will cut off it's own nose out of spite. I refer you to point 1 again.

5. UK industry is by a country mile leading Europe, it's technical manufacturing, research and workforce capabilities exceed all other EU states. That is not to say that they are not good but that the UK industry has grown under strong government support and private sector funding. 

6. Any negative points about security and the UK are complete bullshit. It is clearly understood within member states that in terms of security all countries are equal but some are more equal than others. Romania is not as secure as France for example. There are contributions to Galileo from Canada and Turkey, if they can contribute the UK can lead. 

7. The UK has paid a huge amount into the programme. Short of getting a full refund there should be no debate, we are part of and will continue to be a leading stakeholder in Galileo.",England,/r/europe/comments/8duyt4/the_eus_petulance_is_turning_its_galileo/dxq7vjl/,Brassandblood,1524310839

Facing the violent nature of crime comes with the job, criminals can be violent everywhere.
You cannot blame a culture where people come from - or their skin color - for them being volent, it is simply not true.

I know a lot of black people, north-African, and Middle East Arab migrants including Syrians and no they do not come from “crazy cultures” and are not more intrinsically violent than Texas evangelists. They work hard, take care of their families and friends, party and have fun, study, love and travel. They can be doctors, can be pick-pockets, like everyone.

The extensive use of force, resulting in an unnecessary loss of life, is normalized in the US culture, and muricans will find a hundred thousand reasons to justify an excessive shooting of minorities. “They are violent, they come from crazy cultures , police must protect the innocents, police are heroes risking their lives “ etc etc etc. 

The statistics and how police outside the US work show that it is just excuses and lies. 

Police are supposed to be able to risk their life and not to shoot the hell out of a petty criminal every time they feel scared - it comes with the job, criminals can be violent, and their destiny is to be determined by courts , not by a white folk with a few months of gun training. This police playing the judge brings more injustice and creates wider fractures in society, marginalizes minorities even more and feeds another cycle of violence.

3650,"&gt;Where are you from?

I am part of the European diaspora. My ancestors are from the United Kingdom, and I live in Canada.

&gt;What languages can you speak fluently?

English, French

&gt;What is your usual timezone?

GMT -4:00 hours

&gt;Do you have a PC available that you can use for modding?

Yes.

&gt;Are you willing to use Slack and Toolbox?

Yes.

&gt;Have you had previous experience as a mod inside or outside of reddit?

I am the mod of /r/The_LakeBled (The famous lake in the FYR Slovakia).

&gt;How would you want to improve /r/europe, if you could?

Greater respect and tolerance for politically incorrect, anti-immigration viewpoints, including the view that non-Western cultures and in particular Islam are completely incompatible with Europe, except perhaps immigration of spouses and highly skilled individuals (i.e. surgeons and professors, but not just anyone holding a degree). However, this sort of discussion must occur in a civil and respectful manner. Racism and all other -isms just for the sake of being mean would be strictly banned, but offensive topics must not be silenced just because they're offensive. No tolerance whatsoever for promotion of violence and harassment.

&gt;Why do you think you would be a good addition to the /r/europe mod team?

While many here probably despise my views, I represent a sizable minority of the members of this community. The downtrodden supporters of Mme Frexit Marine Le Pen, the Quaffer of Beer and achiever of British Independence Day Nigel Farage, and other great defenders of liberty. Furthermore, while I may be active on the infamous t_d, I bring a mature approach and am not here for shitposting (except for anything and everything related to Lake Bled, Slovakia). Finally, while I have been banned from /r/europe before, I wish to return as your Nelson Mandela to lead you to an era of equality.

&gt;Do you believe in working as a team or mostly working alone?

I think it depends on the circumstances. Some events are trivial, and others are non-trivial but require quick and decisive action; both of these can be handled alone. On the other hand, major decisions about the direction of a community should be made by a team, perhaps with the final say resting with a leader. It's a fine and tricky balance between having an all-powerful ""king"" and having a ""squabbling parliament"".

&gt;Would you rather use 0400 or 04:00 when meaning 4 am? Why?

Neither. I prefer 4:00 without the ""0"" because this is how my alarm clock displays this time. Of course the 1 there is for 10:XX, 11:XX and 12:XX.

They made the immensely imperialistic French retreat in Africa when the French realised they were outmatched (see Fashoda incident). A bigger proportion of Africa was under British rule than French rule. Almost continuous rule from Egypt to South Africa.

They had immense political and economic influence over South America through British industrialists and gunboat diplomacy. There are many British colonies in central America. 

For the British to rule over any part of continental Europe would be absurd, holding Europe long term is just not feasible, especially not a nation with half the population of Germany. Instead Britain focused on securing the med and containing France using Malta, Cyprus and Egypt.

3769,"The reason is actually pretty simple: In most Indo-European language almost all nominal stems end in a consonant bar a few which ended in a semivowel which is basically a constant already.

Originally after the stem came the case ending of the noun which denoted its grammatical function and number (singular or plural) but in a lot of Indo-European languages the case system has collapsed leaving only number. It just so happens that English has no ending any more for singular but Spanish and Italian retains differiient endings for singular and plural, the -o at the end of nouns in both that's common is actually not part of the stem but it denotes the singular number, hence the ending changes in the plural from ""amico"" to ""amici"" in Italian though in Spanish it tends to change -o for -os so it's less obvious.

If you for instance investigate the Old English noun ""fisc"" for ""fish"" you get something like this:

case/number |singular|plural|
--:|:-:|:-:
nominative | fisc | fiscas
accusative  | fisc | fiscas
dative | fisce | fiscum
genitive | fisces | fisca 
instrumental | fisce | fiscum

Whereas the Latin word ""piscis"" meaning the same is this:

case/number |singular|plural|
--:|:-:|:-:
nominative | piscis | piscēs
accusative  | piscem | piscēs
dative | piscī | piscibus
ablative | pisce | piscibus
genitive | piscis | piscium
vocative | piscis | piscēs

In the Latin case the stem is actually ""pisci"" with the -i after it; you can already see that in Old English the nominative and accusative singular were unmarked for masculine strong nouns and no ending is attached to the stem; this was different in Old Common Germanic where *-az was attached to it which is related to the Latin -us which is also why so many Latin words seem to end on -us; it was a grammatical ending that wasn't actually part of the stem. A lot of other noun types in old English did get an ending in the nominative singular like ""nama"" the old Engish word for ""name"" had as stem just ""nam"" the ""-a"" was the weak masculine nominative singular ending.

In any case the majority of today's English nominal declension is definitely extracted from the strong masculine declension of Old English hence to this day English uses -s for plural and also confusingly enough for posession from the genitive -es ending. In Old English -as and -es were different but the vowels were eliminated making them the same. A select few English nouns are in fact based on the Old English weak declension which used -an for the plural giving rise to oxen, brethren, and children but humorously enough in Old English ""cild"" was actually a strong irregular neuter noun and had the -u strong neuter plural ending in the nominative and its plural was cildru. Interestingly enough the -r- inserted out of nowhere in the plural stayed.",Je kon de macht der goden hebben!,/r/europe/comments/8dqizo/happy_birthday_adolf/dxpwyse/,Kringspier_Des_Heren,1524285481

3834,"&gt; Yeah, and as a sovereign nation France has the right to refuse citizenship to people if they don’t think they’d be a good fit for their country. It’s not unfair for them to say that they don’t want that sort of regressiveness in their country, even if they wouldn’t be able to do anything about it if the person in question was already a citizen.

Its absolutely unfair to refuse citizenship to a person for something that is basic freedom of persons who are citizens.

Citizens have a right not to shake hands for whatever reason (including No particular reason, I just feel like that)

Many people prefer to fistbump if they must, because they feel like its unhygienic to shake hands.

If anything not shaking hands is progressive not regressive - can prevent spreading of germs and reduce healthcare costs .... but I digress (its irrelevant point I was just surprised by ""its regressive"" part)

Anti-Europeanism and anti-E.U. skepticism have been around in the U.K. for decades. In fact, Boris Johnson started his career as an anti-E.U. demagogue writing for the Daily Telegraph in Brussels in the early 1990s.

It is you, actually, who just involved Brexit when the scene we're looking at doesn't even reference Brexit.

&gt; And again, this is a character acting like the character he is supposed to be.

Yes, and I want to know the motivation behind the writing. I don't need you to tell me a character is acting like a character. I mean, it's a brilliant observation but it moves the discussion no further.

&gt; Jewish writers singing ""springtime for Hitler"" arent actual Nazis 

Why do you keep bringing up ""Jewish writers""? What is this bizarre babble? Do you know who the writer of the scene is? If you don't, what makes you think this outlandish comparison is appropriate?

Edit: so I looked up the writer of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, where this scene is from. Perhaps you knew something I didn't, because his name is Jeffrey Yohalem and he's Jewish. He also studied English literature and appears to have lived in London attending a local branch of Yale university. So the ""Montreal based studio""-bit is, we now know, irrelevant. He has a thing for the U.K. His twitter feed, however, appears to indicate he is a firm liberal and an admirer of Barack Obama.

3949,"&gt; In 19th century? No.

Wasn't France more (culturally) influential than the British Empire in that century? Do not get me wrong i'm not saying British had no influence. But in 19th century Ottoman Empire for example French cultural influence was visible. Can't say the same about influence of the British culture in Ottoman Empire which was weaker than the French influence. Also French was the lingua franca of many countries in that century.

&gt;British Empire was so much more than its colonies and its colonies up until about the middle of the 19th century primarily served as a trading centers and facilitators of trade. The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was kind of a watershed moment when Britain committed to running a formal empire. Historically British Empire was like Dutch Empire - mostly commercial.

I know all about this

So let me get this straight, you controlled a bunch of lands on almost every continent, hence a global empire. Fair enough

&gt;On Europe absolutely. Globally? Not at all, Britain without a doubt had bigger. Britain was something like US today - spreading its culture, its language, the reason English became lingua france was because of the British and it was the British that were primary drivers behind the language's popularity for 150 or so years, legal system, the reason British common law is so widespread across the world, and economy through trade and especially of opening up trade routes. For most of 19th and early 20th century it was Britain that was opening new markets and establishing new trade routes or new supply routes and it was Britain that was forcing countries to liberalize their economies by removing restrictions on trade.

Okay. But i'd not say Britain was ""the US"". It was a superpower indeed but culturally I doubt the British influenced the world and even Europe culturally as much as the US. Language is a legit argument but it was the US that made English popular. And the US was founded by settlers from the UK. You even said English became ""lingua france"". It's funny if you actually read this post's first response. Lingua Franca means ""common language"" because of the French's tremendous cultural influence. Why don't we say ""Lingua English"" i don't know. But the British Empire did influence the world a lot both culturally and politically.

&gt; 
&gt; Tell me names of these crazy ideologoes. I would be interested to hear it.

Long, long ago then president Klaus talked about ""[Europeanism](https://www.klaus.cz/clanky/1272)"", characterized:

* by minimizing the role of one, undisputable genuine and evolutionarily developed level of human organization, called “nation-state”;

* by extending the distance between individual citizens and relevant decision-making bodies in remote Brussels or Strasbourg;

* by harmonizing (or unifying) rules and policies instead of preserving competition of different rules and policies


Among other substitute utopian ideologies he [mentioned](https://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/206):

&gt; environmentalism (with its Earth First, not Freedom First principle), radical humanrightism (based – as de Jasay precisely argues – on not distinguishing rights and rightism), the ideology of ‘civic society’ (or communitarism), which is nothing less than one version of post-Marxist collectivism which wants privileges for organized groups, and in consequence, a refeudalization of society […], multiculturalism, feminism, apolitical technocratism (based on the resentment against politics and politicians), internationalism (and especially its European variant called Europeanism) and a rapidly growing phenomenon I call NGOism.

The core of the ancient Egyptian population group was Mediterranean, Levantine, and Zagros Neolithic. 

There were, however, some ancient Egyptians who were black thanks to the country's proximity and relationship with the Kingdom of Kush in Nubia (i.e. what is now modern Sudan) along with travelers, traders and migrants who came from nearby ancient Ethiopia and Eritrea in the Horn of Africa. The Nubians even managed to conquer Egypt in the 8th century BC and held it for a century until the Assyrian invaders pushed them out. The pharaohs of the 25th dynasty, however, were likely the only black pharaohs in Egyptian history. None of the previous dynasties, from what I recall, had rulers with any sub-Saharan genetics in their recovered DNA samples. Their often well-preserved mummies also don't really show any sub-Saharan African features.

As far as Cleopatra is concerned, she was a Macedonian Greek, so discussion of native Egyptians is irrelevant if we're talking about her ancestry.

4179,"&gt; The title says ""May's husband's Investment Firm made a financial killing from the bombing of Syria""

The article is written to imply he somehow owns or is near the top of the company; he is not.

&gt; It doesn;t say anything about any individual investors.

Exactly. And we don't know how much of the $1.4 million he is due. Given that he's a glorified customer service agent, certainly not enough to factor into the decision to bomb Syria.

The argument about Capital Group has everything to do with individual investors; that's who the company deals with. Capital Group doesn't 'have' $1.5 trillion (that figure is their AUM - assets under management), nor do they own $7 billion of Lockheed Martin. Their customers do, whose funds the company manages when don't have the time or skill to play the stock market. In fact, it's a bit of a scam since their customers would be better off investing in an index fund rather than the typical underperformance mutual funds investment firms offer.

So how does Capital Group make their money? Like most firms of their type, they take commission when an investment is liquidated (in this case, Lockheed Martin stock is sold). Depending on the size of a customer's investment, they make upwards of 3.5%. In the impossible utopian scenario where the $7 billion invested is liquidated all at once, it doesn't trigger a massive selloff, and each individual investor's account meets the 3.5% commission requirements, Capital Group would make $245 million.

The real world means they get far less from customers holding Lockheed Martin shares. Still, a 0.67% price increase is 0.67% for anyone involved. The impossible utopian commission rises the price of a Bugatti.

4220,"&gt; So a bunch of ethnostate Switzerlands then?

Basically yes. And to be honest I buy this ideology. The main goal of nationalism is to protect its nation's interest to be independent, just because nazis fucked up this idology and now nationalism is known as a hate toward minorities doesn't change the main primary goal that nationalists had before and what is a true definition of nationalism.

&gt; They weren't exactly peaceful to one another though.

Currently the only wars are the civil wars and warfare inside of a one independent state and the reason is mostly the divided and multicultural society.

As the nations no longer seek for conquest because that's no longer economically profitable the probability of neutrality is very high.

&gt;I think people angry about this are missing a larger point. The argument is, ""Why would the French be so butthurt about something as small as a handshake?""

&gt;The problem is that a handshake is the most basic, non-intrusive cultural custom you can possibly imagine. When someone refuses to engage in a handshake, I have a hard time imagining they're going to be compliant with other cultural customs that are probably going to be more difficult for them, such as co-ed facilities, what you can and can't wear in certain places, etc. If you can't conform to an incredibly basic cultural norm, no way you're going to make it.

This question would get answered in a different way than most would interpret data titled ""Inability to afford paying for one week annual holiday away from home"".

There is no evidence to support this assertion. And I guarantee that whatever analysis you do to try to support it will ignore the unseen benefits to producers who no longer have to jump through hoops to meet the demands of regulators that get passed down to the consumers in the form of lower prices or new innovations.

&gt; And a judge would have to refer to a precise classification of food anyway since it would not be in his power to declare what a certain type of food is, just to declare whether there was fraud or not over a precisely described list of quality a item must satisfy to be called it.

Look up how common law works. A judge would not need to do any such thing, but rather refer to prior case law and if none existed, render a judgement based on the testimony of relevant experts.

&gt; The idea is to prevent fraud from happening in the first place and protecting all people equally from the better informed to the guy who can't read, not let companies try their luck by lying to customers and hoping no one sues them.

4503,"&gt;&gt;I understand that it's scary for some that we can't freeze what we have in time and get a thousand year Reich that stays the same but that shouldn't be the topic.

&gt;Nicely done trying to paint me as a closet Nazi

I wasn't assuming you're in that category, more that the most common arguments I see in these threads seemingly stem from some kind of deep-seated fear that turns into a desire to freeze time and change *somehow*.

&gt;&gt;But in general discussions never get to that baseline because a decent amount of contributors are utterly terrified of the idea that changes could not be negative.

&gt;What has been good about the immigration we got into Europe the last 15 years as a whole?

The issue there is that that question is framed in a way that assumes there will be a clear and easy answer when ""I don't know"" is usually appropriate. We'd have to dive into statistics, economical arguments and so on and will likely end with ""it's complicated"".

Instead what we can also do is look at this question for situations where we *know* how they developed. We can go into the German guest worker programs for example (all in all a success that set the stage for future economic prosperity), we could look at closer examples than the more recent ones where the exact same arguments were made by the exact same people: ""These Turks/Poles are shitty people, they're dirty and steal our cars/women.""

Turns out it was largely bullshit. Most are integrated and productive citizens at this point and we have people with Turkish and Polish names at our universities talking about *our* Goethe because they've known nothing else their entire lives.

I don't *know* in what specific situations the latest immigration was a good thing. But what I *do* know is that the vast, vast majority of it has the same issues that Italians, Spanish or Poles had over here and continue to have. 

In that case it brought us a union that allows Europe to grow on its own without being torn apart by itself or outside interests. It brought understanding and allowed for everyone to move everywhere with ease *once we agreed on basic common values*.

Will integrating people from outside that area be more difficult? Of course, just like integrating the first guest workers wasn't easy.

But it won't be the end of the world. If we cede the discussion to people arguing for and against FORTRESS EUROPE then there won't be a discussion on the *pace* of change which is where I believe the main concern should be.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/8dlwwv/ethnic_makeup_of_babies_born_in_england_wales/dxobplz/,rEvolutionTU,1524223781

&gt;This ceramic amphora called ""Pupa coi baffi"" [dolls with mustache] with such peculiar shape is produced in Grottaglie, a small town in Puglia.

&gt;""The story has begun in the eighteenth century when a winemaker of Martina Franca felt in love with a beautiful girl of Grottaglie decided to merry her. Unfortunately according to an ancient medieval practice called Ius primae noctis or the “right of the first night,” [droit de seigneur], the lord of the manor had the right to posses the future bride. Of course the winemaker was not happy with this imposition and he decided to dress up as a woman and to take the place of his future bride. He disguised himself with expensive clothes and went to the castle, but he forgot to shave off his mustache. He arrived in front of the lord of manor, who he felt cheated once he saw  him with the mustache and ordered to his guards to put him to death. But then, after a laugh he decided to give him a second chance. The lord asked him to bring all the wine he had in the amphorae with his shape, otherwise he would sentenced him to death. So the poor winemaker went to all the ceramic shops asking the artisans to produce amphorae with his shape.  They produced about seven hundred of these anthropomorphic shaped amphorae and at the end he married his beloved. From that moment it was born the precious amphora ""Ius Primae Noctis"" the pupa.""

&gt;Nowadays the Pupe are made with or without the mustache or you can find riding the horse to remind the winemaker's escape from the castle. ",Apulia,/r/europe/comments/8dmusc/ceramic_dolls_with_mustache_from_grottaglie_italy/dxobqhx/,Poggor,1524223825

What data? ""Won't be getting any better"" in what way?  That's a *really* vague statement you just made.

&gt;There's nothing to ensure wealth and well being of Europe, and Europeans so what exactly makes the current 'wager' regarding the mass-non-western immigration worth it?

There's nothing to ensure that the economy won't be ruined by a 2020 resurgence in the Pogs craze, but that's hardly an argument for banning Pogs.

How about the UK, the country we're talking about?

You know, maybe the UK as the world's 5th/6th largest economy in the world *will* get a better deal without having to consider the effects of any future trade deal on the Italian leather shoe industry, for example? We don't need to arrange a trade deal appropriate for 27 other countries, just the UK. If singular countries (most of which do not posses the UK's diplomatic and economic power) were unable to negotiate highly beneficial trade deals then they wouldn't go through the effort of doing so.

How capable are you of discussing whether a trade deal is 'better' or not? What good is it for the UK if the EU arranges a trade deal with Japan that has lower tariffs but for goods that the UK does not export to Japan? It is an absolute joke that a 'great power' like the UK has allowed its trading relationships with other countries to be defined by the needs and desires of 27 other EU countries, many of which are barely home to the population of some British cities and their urban areas. Greater Manchester has a larger population than that of 7 EU members.

Sry for sounding condescending, didn't mean to. I probably forgotten you said that in your comment. But concerning this:

&gt; Despite the difference is merely one chromosome (with not that many genes on that, and some in addition are shared with X chromosome!), the consequences are huge

Interestingly the differences aren't that huge though. Sexual organs are made up pretty much from the same basic parts. The reason why they are physically different from each other is purely based on hormones and nothing else (hell even with two X chromosomes with too much androgen women can get male sexual organs). So in the end how we physically end up is not necessarily because of the additional information from the Y chromosome but essentially just how our bodies regulate hormones. We really aren't that different from each other (neither sex nor ""race"") What people perceive as different stems purely from culture, looks and language. Other than that we are really just all the same.

The additional problem with ""race"" is that we project crime statistics and other things like IQ onto groups of people only because of their skin color which biologically makes no sense especially when you don't consider environmental factors (racism, generational wealth etc). That's why we should start talking about ancestry and stop thinking about skin color as an important trait.

Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party is doing lasting damage

Once hollowed out, the rule of law is hard to restore

FOR a glimpse of Poland under the populist Law and Justice (PiS) party, tune in to the news on the state television channel, Telewizja Polska (TVP). The opening sequence, a computer-animated tour of Polish landmarks, homes in on the clock tower of Warsaw’s royal castle. The capital’s most recognisable building, the towering Soviet-era Palace of Culture and Science, is nowhere to be seen. Then the anchors appear, and proceed to praise PiS slavishly while branding its critics treacherous crypto-communists.

This combination of subtle and brazen nationalist revisionism captures the two-and-a-half years of PiS rule. The party has purged the public administration, made it illegal to accuse the “Polish nation” of complicity in the Holocaust, and peddled conspiracy theories about the aeroplane crash in 2010 which killed then-president Lech Kaczynski and 95 others outside Smolensk, in Russia. It has turned a blind eye to chauvinism among its supporters, while prosecuting peaceful counter-protesters at the monthly commemorations of the Smolensk disaster led by Lech’s twin brother, Jaroslaw (pictured), who is PiS’s chairman.

Most troubling, PiS has neutered the constitutional tribunal and given lawmakers and ministers more power over the appointment of judges, threatening their independence. It has sown deep divisions within Poland and with its allies in the European Union, as well as with Israel and America. It has transformed Poland from a poster-boy of post-communist transition into the EU’s problem child. In March a judge in Ireland refused to extradite a Polish defendant to his homeland, worried that he might not get a fair trial.

And PiS isn’t done. Mr Kaczynski, who holds no office other than MP yet acts as Poland’s de facto leader, recently told a right-wing weekly that there are “parts of our reality which must not merely be modernised but ploughed over”. His party, he mused, needs at least three terms in office.

That prospect sends liberals scrambling for a stiff drink. It is a headache for the EU. In December the European Commission triggered proceedings against Poland under Article 7 of the EU treaty, which could ultimately lead to suspending its voting rights. In March, after the commission rejected Poland’s justifications of its reforms, the government proposed softening them, for instance by limiting the justice minister’s power to replace district-court presidents. But even if PiS yields further, the grief it has caused Poland will not go away.

The nationalist international

At first glance, the party’s ascendancy follows a familiar script. From Viktor Orban in Hungary to Donald Trump in America, populists have converted economic malaise and fear of immigrants into electoral success. Yet Poland departs from that script in important ways. Immigration is negligible; the wave of Syrian migrants in 2015, which initially crossed through Hungary, never touched Poland. Meanwhile, Poland’s economic performance has been nothing short of extraordinary.

The economy has grown for 26 consecutive years. GDP per person has nearly trebled since 1990 (see chart). Since 2000 manufacturing’s share of the economy has grown, and inequality has fallen. Poland was the only EU country to weather the crisis of 2008-09 without a recession.

For an illustration, drive north from Warsaw into Mazowsze. The region is as gorgeous as a Chopin concerto, an undulating quilt of cereal fields and birch groves, but in the 1990s its towns were unromantically down-at-heel. Today it is dotted with handsome farmsteads. Tractors are still mostly Polish-made Ursuses, but now come with air-conditioning and sound systems. In the cobbled market square of Pultusk, a town of 20,000, and down the road in the village of Golymin, shops offer luxuries unimaginable two decades ago: $100 Nike sneakers and wine at $20 a bottle.

Such wealth accumulation was well under way by 2015. Yet PiS won both the presidential and parliamentary elections that year. In Pultusk, in the parliamentary election, the party claimed 46% of the vote, nine percentage points above its national average. In Golymin, it got 58%.

Fatigue with the centre-right Civic Platform (PO) played a part. PO had grown complacent after eight years at the helm. In 2014 its charismatic leader, Donald Tusk, stepped down as prime minister to become president of the European Council, leaving his party rudderless. Its politicians were caught on tape discussing matters of state in filthy language. They said nothing terribly damning, but it left a bad smell.

Many voters were in any event growing fed up with finger-wagging elites telling them to work harder to get ahead. This dual weariness, with the PO and the post-1989 gospel of self-improvement, played into Mr Kaczynski’s hands. He and his brother were among the leaders of the Solidarity movement who negotiated Poland’s bloodless transition to democracy. But Jaroslaw, especially, felt that it let ex-communists off the hook too lightly.

In 2001 the Solidarity coalition split into the PO, which embodied the post-1989 consensus, and the anti-elitist PiS. It appealed to those who, like the Kaczynskis, felt they deserved more, and who sensed that, while they might be prospering, well-connected insiders were doing better. In 2005 PiS took a quarter of the vote, enough for a plurality in parliament. But its unruly coalition with two other anti-establishment parties collapsed two years later.

By 2015 Poles’ sense of being shortchanged had grown, not because they were worse off, but because their aspirations outpaced reality. Many had experience of western Europe, where 2m or so had sought work since Poland joined the EU in 2004. Interviews with denizens of Pultusk-like towns by Maciej Gdula, a sociologist at Warsaw University, reveal that PiS supporters are neither left behind nor frustrated with their lives. But they want more—and they want it now.

PiS promised them less condescension and more protection. In Andrzej Duda it found a young, affable presidential contender who outmanoeuvred Bronislaw Komorowski, the PO’s respectable but dull incumbent. Beata Szydlo, Mr Kaczynski’s pick for prime minister, was less divisive than the chairman, who kept a low profile. Aided by images of migrants pouring into western Europe, PiS exploited fears of a Muslim invasion. The centre-left split into two camps, neither of which got enough votes to enter parliament. PiS won an unprecedented absolute majority.

With control of parliament and a sympathetic president, PiS prime ministers—first Ms Szydlo and, since December, Mateusz Morawiecki—set about delivering on campaign promises. They recklessly reversed a PO pension reform by cutting the retirement age, introduced a monthly benefit of 500 zlotys ($148) per child starting with the second-born, reformed the justice system (ostensibly to make it more efficient), and went after evasion of value-added tax, raising receipts by 23%. This flurry of activity made PiS’s critics look like weak, privileged naysayers. Meanwhile, the economy continues to grow at 4%, wages are up and inflation is subdued.

PiS is aided by an underlying conservative streak in Polish society. In the 1990s not even the left-wing governments championed social liberalism. Poland’s abortion law is among Europe’s strictest. The global #MeToo movement against sexual harassment has been more #NotMe in Poland, outside a few feminist circles. Pride in Poland’s undoubted virtues—it never collaborated with the Nazis, and was the first country in the Soviet bloc to topple communism—can turn xenophobic. At last November’s independence-day march, some openly carried fascist banners.

Until 2015 pro-European elites maintained a guardrail against such sentiments. PiS has dismantled it. “No Brussels bureaucrat will tell us what democracy is,” sums up one person close to Mr Morawiecki.

What is democracy, according to PiS? First, it is majoritarian. Any constraint amounts to “legal impossibilism”, Mr Kaczynski’s term for what his liberal critics call checks and balances. The opposition is given short shrift. Legislation is pushed through as private-members’ bills, which unlike government proposals can dispense with public consultation. In 2016 40% of PiS’s 181 draft laws were submitted in this way, up from 15% and 13% in the previous two parliamentary terms.

Lacking a supermajority to amend the constitution, PiS did the next best thing and nobbled the constitutional tribunal. It replaced five judges seated by the previous parliament (including two who, admittedly, the PO had appointed irregularly when a loss at the polls looked imminent). More egregiously, the government ignored several unfavourable rulings.

The second feature of PiS-style democracy is rulers’ freedom of action. The justice minister doubles as the chief prosecutor, deciding which transgressions to prosecute (Smolensk counter-protesters) and which to ignore (marchers with illegal fascist flags). A draft law would sack the entire diplomatic corps and let the foreign minister rehire whomever he wants.

In this worldview cadres are everything. According to an analysis by the Forum of Civic Development, a think-tank in Warsaw, 37 PiS laws have led to the sacking of more than 11,300 civil servants. The party decides which ex-communists are repentant patriots (PiS’s ranks are full of such figures), and which are unreformed enemies of the state. Many of the latter, including military top brass, have been purged.

If this sounds like an affront to the constitution, the PiS-dominated tribunal seems unperturbed. It judged 88 cases last year, half as many as in 2015, nearly always siding with the government. When the civil-rights ombudsman, Adam Bodnar, challenged PiS’s reforms of the tribunal, including the dodgy investiture of three judges, his complaint was rejected by a panel that included two of the judges in question.

Does PiS, which won 38% of the vote in 2015, have a mandate to rip up the post-1989 social contract? Mr Morawiecki plays down Mr Kaczynski’s talk of revolution. But, he adds, “every contract can be amended.” Polish institutions need a shake-up, he says. Courts average 685 days to enforce a contract, the fourth-slowest in Europe. None of the provisions in the judicial reforms, he says, is unique to Poland.

Wolf in Italian wool

It is a cunning sales pitch. No single move looks revolutionary in isolation. Lithuanian supreme-court justices are appointed and dismissed by parliament at the president’s request. In Denmark and Sweden ministers appoint members of the judicial council. As blatant as the state media’s populist tilt is, PiS claims it is only correcting its historically liberal bias.

Mr Morawiecki, a millionaire former banker, was promoted to prime minister in December at the orders of Mr Kaczynski, who had tired of Ms Szydlo. He is worldlier and cleverer than his predecessor, and speaks fluent English. Where Ms Szydlo shunned Brussels, he engages.

Yet when it comes to ridding the state of the (mostly imaginary) remnants of communism, Mr Morawiecki appears to be a true believer. In the 1980s his father founded a radical splinter of Solidarity. Mr Morawiecki, then a teenager, was kidnapped by the secret police, beaten and told to dig his own grave, but refused to give up his father’s whereabouts. In contrast to many party colleagues, his disdain for the old regime seems genuine. But this zeal may lead him to push Poland closer to the sort of “illiberal democracy” which Mr Orban has created in Hungary, and which Mr Kaczynski makes no secret of desiring.

Poland is not quite Hungary. Its civil society is livelier. Its economy is more diverse and lacks media oligarchs, notes Jan-Werner Müller, a scholar of populism at Princeton University. Viewership of TVP news is falling, while independent newspapers benefit from the PiS version of the “Trump bump”. Where other populists cosy up to Vladimir Putin, Mr Kaczynski loathes Russia, which he blames (with little evidence) for the Smolensk crash.

PiS is not immune to criticism. Proposals to regulate independent media have been shelved. So have efforts to outlaw all abortions, after thousands of women took to the streets. Courts have mostly dismissed the charges against anti-PiS protesters. Ms Szydlo’s decision to award herself and her cabinet 2.1m zlotys before her demotion may cost PiS in local elections in the autumn. “Bonus-gate” may explain its slide in some recent polls.

The party is not as monolithic as myth would have it, either. In March Mr Duda broke ranks and vetoed a bill which would allow communist-era soldiers to be stripped of rank. A faction leery of Mr Morawiecki’s rise has tried to clip his wings. Neither he nor Mr Kaczynski controls Zbigniew Ziobro, the Jacobin justice minister, who leads his own group in parliament.

Then there is the EU. Besides the Article 7 proceedings, a growing chorus of member states wants future EU aid to be tied to rule-of-law considerations. Faced with a choice between revolution and EU money, which flows disproportionately to its poorer rural base, PiS may think again.

But even if PiS’s wrecking job were halted, deep scars would remain. Society has split into warring camps. A PO leader looks bemused when asked if he has friends in PiS. Mr Morawiecki’s aides react similarly to a question about pals in the PO.

Purges of the military and intelligence services have strained relationships with allies. Diplomatic fallout from the Holocaust law, which America and Israel see as whitewashing the role some Poles played, has been disastrous. Poland risks becoming like Turkey, a prickly ally important only because of its strategic location, says a Washington insider.

The economy, though healthy, could be better given the ruddy global outlook. Its rate of convergence with western Europe has slowed. A tight labour market and extravagant handouts have fuelled consumption (the government has doled out 42.6bn zlotys in the new child benefit alone since 2016) but not private investment. Grzegorz Baczewski of Leviatan, a bosses’ association, blames this in part on regulatory uncertainty. Laws affecting entire sectors are rushed through parliament. A ban on Sunday trading was passed in January and came into force in March. Mr Morawiecki’s talk of national champions and “national capital” risks putting off foreigners.

State capitalism of the sort the prime minister seems to favour may weigh on productivity. This needs to rise for growth to persist as the population, which dipped below 38m in 2015, continues to shrink. Few expect the child benefit to reverse the trend. In the short term it may constrain the supply of labour. According to one estimate, the child benefit has discouraged 103,000 women from work. Labour-force participation among young women is at a 19-year low. The lower retirement age will make matters worse. This, plus the expected fall in EU aid after 2020, prompted Fitch and Standard &amp; Poor’s, two rating agencies, to revise Poland’s potential GDP growth rate down to 1.5-2.6% in the next decade.

Worst of all, PiS’s assault on Poland’s institutions undermines citizens’ trust in them. Its campaign to paint the judiciary as a corrupt clique—complete with billboards depicting a drunk-driving judge—doubtless contributed to falling confidence in the justice system, down from 41% in 2015 to 32%, according to a Eurobarometer poll.

At best, PiS’s illiberal reforms might be reversed by the next party that wins an election. But they have set a precedent: future governments may repeat the cycle of court-packing and purges. In the worst case, Poland may have started down the authoritarian road already travelled by Turkey and Hungary. Today few see this as likely. But when such things shift, they shift faster than anyone expects.",Polihs grasshooper citizen,/r/europe/comments/8dlskz/polands_ruling_law_and_justice_party_is_doing/dxo5848/,SlyScorpion,1524209484

4814,"You're wrong there bud, it's actually the most ""common"" wage (common because 500.000 people put of 19 million earn it, as the wage categories go from 100 to 100€ and this one has the biggest amount of workers) because of the unqualified jobs. McDonalds pay as well +1100€ net to full time workers, and it is one of the worst paying jobs (this one enters at this 1000€ net per 14 months/1180€ net per 12 months) for example.

According to the sindicates, even in hostelry the average net wage is circa 1.100€ and the vast majority of people working in this category are youths. 

Supermarket chains such as Consum, Mercadona, ALDI or LIDL (the biggest ones in Spain) start with wages of at least 1.200€ per month, Mercadona and LIDL goes up to 1.400€ per month and this is a youth starting from day 1. After gaining experience and capacities you earn more and more. 

For the unqualified jobs of Correos, mail workers for example, they earn from 1.200 to 1.600 depending on the job and the horary. These ones working in the depository at night earn 800€ per half shift, 1600€ per full shift (NET) and this is unqualified as well. 

Wages in Spain are actually pretty close to he on pair with the average in western Europe, as I said before, in both France and Belgium (you can check it) their average and medium wages are 200-250€ more per month, even in the UK the difference is about 300€ per month. Yet our cost of life is significantly cheaper, especially compared to the northern countries, where it is much more expensive than here. The only and real problems in Spain are: it is harder to find a job than in most of western Europe (yet not impossible) and that a good number of the young qualified workers have low wages because they have no experience, and the companies take advantage of this. In many cases even a Correos worker can earn more than a new graduated engineer. Still, this happens in many western European countries. Youths from England, France or the US also complain for the same.

&gt;“At home the child must be an unbearable burden to the mother, who has to care for five healthy children,” Asperger wrote in his report.

&gt;He concluded that permanent placement at Am Spiegelgrund — the notorious reformatory and psychiatric clinic where nearly 800 children were killed under Nazi rule — seemed “absolutely necessary.”

&gt;On Sept. 2, 1941, only a day after her third birthday, Herta died of pneumonia, “the most common cause of death at Spiegelgrund, which was routinely induced by the administration of barbiturates over a longer period of time,” according to an academic paper published Thursday in the medical journal Molecular Autism. The report comes during National Autism Awareness Month and just in time for Adolf Hitler’s birthday.

&gt;The author, medical historian Herwig Czech, argued that Asperger — a pioneer in the study of autism and related disorders — ingratiated himself with the Nazi regime and “actively cooperated” with the Nazi eugenics program by helping to send severely disabled children to Spiegelgrund, which was known as “a concealed killing center.”

&gt;“We see someone who could have easily avoided this work altogether but seemingly participated without qualms,” Czech said Thursday about Asperger in a phone interview with The Washington Post.

&gt;Czech acknowledged that it would have been difficult for Asperger to keep those children alive, but he said that the pediatrician “certainly could have avoided sending them to their death.”",,/r/europe/comments/8dknaq/hans_asperger_hailed_for_autism_research_may_have/dxnwqag/,michapman,1524195685

Because the Right Wing is awful at it? I don't know, but they're clearly worse at it. The Right Wing Corporatists are very good at controlling local level elections and getting policies that they like passed or snuck into a bill. They even get some moderate people on the Left to cover for them often. The only Populist Friendly big donor I've seen is Mercer so the jury is still out on that imo.

&gt;There is nothing nefarious about Soros donating 14 billion dollars to open society foundation.

Yes there is. It dilutes our democracies.

&gt;There are hard data depending on the aspect of political activism / lobbying.

And I question its value. Just because someone can create a plot or some percentages doesn't mean it's actually good data. It's like the banks who used complicated models to predict that the subprime mortgage market would have the same failure rate as previous mortgages; total bullshit backed by pretty models.

Also, Big Donorship, Lobbying, and Politicians retiring into nice jobs is effectively legalized corruption. Sure people will try to follow it, but it's obviously a nod and wink sort of business. It's like trying to predict how much heroin is smuggled yearly. They put out numbers, but if those people had to bet money on the accuracy most of them would be broke before long.

A fetus is nothing more than a developing piece of tissue until it seriously starts developing its brain. Before the brain, it's just cells that multiply to form even more complex pairs. At this point, the only thing guiding these complex formations are instructions from the point of conception.

The fetus is even less sentient than a typical animal. You can say ""omg, did you just call a human an animal,"" but the point remains that it's not human at all, and so it's better to not let it develop past the point of no return where it'll grow up to be a human being.

After it's born, it will probably be raised by a family that couldn't afford to raise it in the first place.

However, your pundits would avoid providing that in the first place, which is quite strange considering the general hatred for abortions.

What's worse is that it'll grow up without the adequate nurturing needed for a standard child. This increases the likelihood that the person will delve into a life of poverty and crime. They'll probably end up serving jail time which many of your pundits seem to want to increase as well. 

As for a life of poverty, many of the same people would argue against social welfare to these people, which continues the cycle.

contradicts your points. Armies and navies are absolutely essential and effective in the ""nuclear age"" (which we have been in since 1945 btw) for multiple reasons: protecting borders, projecting power and, though this wouldn't apply for the EU, meddling in other non-nuclear power countries. 

Even in a case of conflict with nuclear powers like Russia there's no reason to assume it would go nuclear because Russia has as big of an interest in survival and self perpetuation as we have, in that sense nukes are more of a guarantee against total war and major military operations and occupations a la WW2, not, for example, defending Baltics if Russia decides it wants to ""protect"" its ""oppressed"" minority there.

(Of course you cant simply leave Islam in a muslim country because in this case you can be killed, but you can do so in the west).

Also important: Your nice Muslim neighbours are the passive threat. If shit hits the fan they will not kill you, but only a small minority will protect you from the more radical, muslims. They are also the sea the jihadis swim in, they will not support them but they will hide them, let them indoctrinate their children and give money, to go to the paradise by a peacefull way, like immigrate to the land of the infidels and breed like insane.

In the long run it's much more feasible than German taxpayers covering the ever increasing welfare costs for an eternity.

&gt;Refugee quotas are about refugees and not about rejected asylum seekers.

Same shit, different package. It doesn't change the fact that you're still forcing it on both the people and on the refugees who don't wanna live in poorer eastern Eu countries that don't have as much to offer in terms of welfare.

&gt;So now Germany even prevents other countries from deporting rejected asylum seekers?

5138,"&gt; I'm not exactly sure what kind of idea you want to promote here but considering that you mix refugees, guest workers and, apparently, every conceivable type of immigrant into the same mass, I'm not sure it's worth entertaining.

You're dishonest if you can pinpoint my immigration views based off only few reddit comments. 

My point is that temporary resettlement programs (refugees, guest workers) are not temporary in reality. I did not talk about other forms of immigration at all. Perhaps I was ambiguous, but nowhere did I say what you're accusing me of.

&gt;Because it's absurd to say that Polish workers, Indian programmers and African refugees are one and the same.

Again, nowhere did I say that. I'll assume people down voting me are assuming I said any of that.

All that being said, I do not think it is absurd to say that temporary migrants are in high possibility of becoming permanent. Look at the problems in US with El Salvadorians for a more recent example. It's a proper fear to have. By including those into a total number of people coming that will provide the true number of migrants. After all, that's how the Turks stayed in Germany.

I have been to many festivals in ""northern Greece"" and i can say with certainty that this is not the case.

[Radio address by Thomas Mann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngju-5ZQ_dg) (YouTube) - [written text](https://www.cicero.de/innenpolitik/ich-habe-nichts-einzuwenden/36748):

&gt;Zum ersten Mal jährt sich der Tag der Zerstörung von Coventry durch Görings Flieger, – einer der schauderhaftesten Leistungen, mit denen Hitler-Deutschland die Welt belehrte, was der totale Krieg ist und wie man sich in ihm aufführt. In Spanien fing’s an, wo die Maschinisten des Todes diese nationalistisch erzogene Rasse mit den leeren, entmenschten Gesichtern, sich vorübten für den Krieg.  
&gt;(...)   
&gt;Beim jüngsten britischen Raid über Hitlerland hat das alte Lübeck zu leiden gehabt. Das geht mich an, es ist meine Vaterstadt. Die Angriffe galten dem Hafen, den kriegsindustriellen Anlagen, aber es hat Brände gegeben in der Stadt, und lieb ist es mir nicht, zu denken, daß die Marienkirche, das herrliche Renaissance-Rathaus oder das Haus der Schiffer-Gesellschaft sollten Schaden gelitten haben. Aber ich denke an Coventry – und habe nichts einzuwenden gegen die Lehre, daß alles bezahlt werden muß.  
&gt;(...)  
&gt;Hitler-Deutschland hat weder Tradition noch Zukunft. Es kann nur zerstören, und Zerstörung wird es erleiden. Möge aus seinem Fall ein Deutschland erstehen, das gedenken und hoffen kann, dem Liebe gegeben ist rückwärts zum Gewesenen und vorwärts in die Zukunft der Menschheit hinaus. So wird es, statt tödlichen Hasses, die Liebe der Völker gewinnen.

5197,"Take account these articles do it for the ""amarillismo"" and to create polemics. They say it's 16.500 brut per year, that is 1.200€ net a month. If you see, they specifically mention these 1000€ within 14 payments, but most of Europe receives 12, not 14 payments unlike in Spain. With 12 payments it would be 1.200€ net.

They also made a pretty strange categorization, they say it's the most frequent wage but turns out only 500.000 people earn that wage (from the almost 19 million workers Spain has) as they mention 14 payments, here the additional payments are even higher than your normal monthly wage, and most companies pay as well a 3rd wage in December sharing some of the profits, so in many cases you will earn 15 wages a year. And they are including all the part time jobs as well.

The average wage in Spain is about 1.920€ per month while the median goes close to 1.630€ , in both cases it's just 200-250€ less a month than in France or Belgium but as you know the life is cheaper as well in Spain. It's as well a bit higher than in Italy and almost double than Portugal, for example.

Btw as you know, there is a very huge underground economy in Spain. Many people with lower wages earn an additional wage every month in the ""B way"" so both the employee and employer save to spend more money on taxes, as you know taxation goes from certain grups of wages, for example people earning than 12.000 per year are even exempt to make the year declaration of income.


It is true that for new and young qualified people it's pretty hard to find a decent job but this happens in the majority of the developed countries, it is easier to find it in 2nd world countries. I know even American guys with new college degrees earning a bit less than the minimum wage!

So you either comply with all the complicated standards and provide a ton of paperwork completely on your own, or go home.

5247,"&gt;  why should they care even in the slightest about IP laws directly in the way of them being able to prosper?

Why should a company take a risk and invest into R&amp;D on a product if that methodology is just going to be ripped off by another company without penalty the moment the innovation can be manufactured at scale? Why even do any R&amp;D? Let's just stagnate technologically and never move forward, because of these underhanded tactics.

There are a lot of areas of copyright/patents that I think are toxic and stupid, like how Disney as a corporation has managed to extend copyright out to an unfathomable amount of years after Walt died. However, the core concept is absolutely critical to keeping the process of innovation fair and lucrative. 

I would like to see an international treaty reforming the process (one that China would be strongarmed into joining) that goes back to the original concept's roots of awarding the original innovator or team of innovators exclusivity for roughly the remainder of their lifetime. Since some innovations are a company effort and not just a guy in a wig under an apple tree thinking about life, there should be a clause that extends exclusivity to the company *so long as the person/team that created it is still working at the same company*. So it encourages innovation within a company because it's like pseudo-tenure, so the workers a.) get a stipend and b.) gain leverage over their employers. In both of these cases, I believe it would be healthy for the American and EU economies. 

----------------------------------------------------------

P.S. Before it's brought up (surprisingly it hasn't in this thread!) the US did in fact perpetrate mass IP theft against the British Empire in the 19th century. [You can read about it here in this excellent article.](http://foreignpolicy.com/2012/12/06/we-were-pirates-too/) FP makes the case that Chinese IP theft and American IP theft are fundamentally different for three reasons: colonial history, accuracy of schematics and blueprints, and the government's role in IP theft. 

Colonial history is straightforward -- the US was still effectively at war with Britain well into the early 19th century. Adding an economic war on top of a military war is not particularly tasteful, but it's not surprising. After all, blockades are both at the same time. Furthermore, all IP theft recorded during this period was exclusively Americans stealing from the Brits -- to my knowledge we did not do the same to the French, Germans, or Italians. Pessimistically this might be because Britain was the center of the Industrial Revolution and the others were lagging, but at least partially I believe it's because (like the article argues) due to our colonial history we were absolutely livid over any rules the Brits would throw over us like IP laws. 

The second is that the IP theft was ineffective in many cases. The article opens with a man who committed textile machine schematics to his brain in order to smuggle the knowledge out of the UK, which has inherent limitations. Today, China has no such hurdles -- they plant industrial spies everywhere, especially the USA and Germany, copy USB thumb drives and files, and get immediate and accurate access to records and processes. What the USA did to the UK was small-time chickenshit, even if it was equally dishonorable.

The last point is related to the second one. The Chinese government is in on the scam, which is entirely unlike the US government during the 19th century. In order to do business in China, you need a domestic Chinese joint partner business. You operate for 4-5 years, sharing everything you do with the partner, and eventually you find your relationship dissolved mysteriously. Then you see your partner take over your market share in China, and probably eventually in other places, because they've cut you off. This is standard operating procedure dreamed up by the CCP, and almost nowhere in the world will you find similar restrictions on doing business. Not in the USA, not in the EU, it's absolutely unheard of. Furthermore like the article states, in order to sell computer chips to China you need to provide them open source code and diagrams of the chip's construction -- why? Because they're going to steal it from you. It's extortion. This is absolutely, without a doubt, far worse than even the scummiest things the USA did to the Brits during the 19th century.

edit: It's actually worse than I thought with the CCP's role in this. They passed a very vague cybersecurity law last year that allows them to review all ""technology services and products"" to see if they ""affect national security,"" which goes even further than the chip open source example. Anyone who exports technology to China should probably stop at this point, because those tech companies would be investing millions or even billions into R&amp;D just to have the CCP copy the fruits of their research/labor and give it to their hand-picked companies. http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/23/technology/china-us-trump-tariffs-ip-theft/index.html","pro-European culture, EU-neutral",/r/europe/comments/8dd44g/in_2017_the_united_states_was_the_eus_largest/dxnd90f/,pbrand,1524173972

Ask hungarians? Especially hungarian nationalist underline their hunic-heritage. This is also the reason, why Hungary has a good relationship with Kasachstan. This is even underlined in their national anthem:

You brought our ancestors up
Over the Carpathians' holy peaks
By You was won a beautiful homeland
For Bendeguz's sons
And wherever flow the rivers of
The Tisza and the Danube
Árpád our hero's descendants
Will root and bloom.

Beneguz was the father of Atilla the hun.

5271,"&gt; Philip May is a Senior Executive of Capital Group

Theresa May's husband is a 'customer relationship manager', a fancy way of saying he makes sure each customer is happy &amp; stays with the firm. He is not a 'senior executive.'

&gt; Philip May’s Capital Group owned around 7.09% of Lockheed Martin in March 2018

First of all, nice job on identifying Philip May as somehow an owner or in charge of Capital Group. Second, Capital Group DOES NOT own 7.09% of Lockheed Martin. If they did own it, then they could keep funds from dividends &amp; stock liquidation. They cannot; their customers do, with Capital Group [charging](https://www.americanfunds.com/individual/investments/share-class-information/share-class-pricing.html) a commission of around 3%, depending on the size of a customer's account.

If every customer portfolio with Lockheed Martin was liquidated at the very same moment (which is impossible; any realistic liquidation of that amount would trigger a massive sell off) then the most Capital Group could make is $210,000,000. That 0.67% rise Lockheed Martin experienced after the bombings? That increases Capital Group's profit... a whopping $1,407,000. Nice; Syria netted them a Pagani.

&gt; Every single JASSM used in the recent bombing of Syria costs more than $1,000,000, and as a result of their widespread use during the recent bombing of Syria by Western forces...

The author apparently thinks 18% of total missiles fired constitutes 'widespread'.

&gt; the share price of Lockheed Martin soared.

Investors apparently were so thrilled that the JASSM's used constituted 0.35% of Lockheed Martin's total revenue, their rush to invest increased Lockheed Martin's stock... 0.67%.

Despite the introduction of tighter laws regulating vaccinations, not enough children are being immunized against measles in Germany.

But vaccination rates averaged 92.9 percent for the decisive second measles vaccination and were not satisfactory, the institute said.

5388,"&gt; I shouldn't even post these since we all know the history of martial law in Turkey but it's for the neutral observer..

I already talked about this. Martial law isn't OHAL. They different things in Turkish _for very good reason_. One is the administration being handed over to the military, the other is within the scope of the civil administration.

And this doesn't change the fact that martial law hasn't been declared by any of the opposition regime and the last instance ended in 1987, relinquished by the military.

&gt; How? And Ecevit was just a politician permitted by the actual regime (military) to run the government as other politicians. Some elected politicians weren't allowed (or simply made to resign) by the same military regime. It was the military regime that was calling the shots, not politicians like Ecevit, Ozal or Demirel. And they all knew what the military would do if they got out of line or got creative with their policies. So essentially not much different than the Iranian regime with their supreme leader and his council calling the shots over politicians in Iran.

Yet you are using this military regime (which didn't actually decide on everything, that ""regime"" changed a lot over time) to justify not voting for opposition parties the connection simply doesn't exist.

&gt; Wasn't it you who said something about ""terrorists"" when referring to the other opposition party? It was a succession of posts back and forth, if it was the other user, then my apologies, certainly a mistake/confusion with another user.

No, it wasn't me.

&gt; My opinions are neither false nor a lie. They are based on historical record + my own experiences.

Yet you didn't have the balls to back up your claim that Kılıçdaroğlu kicks people out of the party all the time for challenging him. You quoted it but ignored it.

If you can't back your opinion up, I'll call it a lie and prove it, just like how I mentioned Muharrem İnce still being an influential member of the party despite challenging Kılıçdaroğlu. You don't actually defend what you say. You say you're right but you don't say why.

&gt; What?

You changed your argument about freedom instead of defending your original claim of ""I haven't lost any freedoms""

&gt; Let me rephrase it. Turkey's freedoms are no more diminished than they were with the previous regimes. The current OHAL is hurting Kurds (which is nothing new, almost every government post-1980 coup had OHAL in Kurdish areas during their term starting with Ozal) but it was initially imposed to round up Gulen supporters in the establishment.

There are 100000 people out of a job. You can't protest against the government. You can't reach the courts of the state doesn't want you to. You can be denied medical care and if a police officer beats you bloody nothing needs to be done against them.

Freedoms are thing that you must _have_, even if you don't choose to exercise them. If you don't protest against the government, that doesn't mean you have the freedom to do so. The OHAL removes all but the most elementary of freedoms (right to life and rule of law). No Turkish citizen has them because they can be and are taken away at a moment's notice with a KHK.

I wonder what you think of all the leftists the coupists rounded up in 1980 because that's exactly what's happening now.

&gt; And CHP or other opposition don't offer any better alternative or an alternative to be trusted to people except empty words, vague claims, but nothing specific.

[CHP Election Declaration, 2015](http://www.radikal.com.tr/secim-2015/chpnin-2015-secim-bildirgesinin-tam-metni-1339188/)

They propose this and more, yet the only stuff that gets picked up by the media is the ""outlandish"" statements. They have always stood on the side of media freedom for example and openly campaigned for legislation in this field. Your claim is false. They offer an alternative. They do offer full (heh) words, concrete and specific claims.

&gt; Since you claim that I lie about CHP having nothing better to offer (or that I don't know), you tell me why I should vote for Kılıçdaroğlu. And why should an average AKP voter change his opinion and vote for Kılıçdaroğlu.

He is the only party head to promies lowering the election threshold. There, that's pretty big and arguably the biggest issue of the Turkish political system.

I don't have to argue about why an average AKP voter should change his opinion and vote for Kılıçdaroğlu, I don't want them to. If they don't hold the principles that the CHP represents dear, they're welcome to vote for somebody else. They just shouldn't go on the defensive when we tell them that they vote a corrupt party built of dividing, treacherous rhetoric that is working against their interests. They should vote Saadet or something.

&gt; Be specific though. Don't make claims like ""modern Turkey"" (which is vague and meaningless), Ataturk (what does that do for people?), freedoms (sure), tell people what will definitely change in their lives for the better if they vote for Kılıçdaroğlu..

Even Kılıçdaroğlu doesn't base his claims on these. You have been drinking some weird Kool Aid.

&gt; Say something he can and will really do.

Tax reform, separation of powers, rolling back the corrupt public-procurement system, end the wasteful public spending and reverse wealth transfer policies of the AKP, better privacy laws, dialing back internet restrictions but most of all: rule by seeking consensus, as he wouldn't have the option of ruling as a dictat like right-wing parties are used to.

&gt; Edit: I keep mentioning Kurds, because aside from all things, they also have a vote. And their votes didn't favor Kılıçdaroğlu in previous elections either. A lot of them (aside from the ones voting for HDP) actually voted for AKP. How do you explain this?

I explain it in many ways, chiefly them being conservatives. If I meet one I'll argue with them too. I don't need them to vote CHP. This is not relevant to your ignorance and lies.

&gt; Edit2: I also forgot to include this (regarding martial laws and military interventions into Turkey's politics): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Turkish_military_memorandum

Not martial law, not OHAL and not the fault of any opposition party. In fact Erdoğan's buddies had a bigger hand in it.

&gt; It should shed some light on why a lot of people are tired of the old regime overseen by the military and same political establishments.

5435,"&gt;Firstly, one of those comments was about gypsies. Are you a gypsy now?

No, only sheds some light on certain mentalities though.

&gt;Really, are we handpicking literal nazis

I actually never handpicked him, didn't even bother to check when I searched for the threads related to the topic and plucked the comment from where I remembered it. Point being, that I witness the same kind of opinions on /r/Europe frequently as well, from Poles, not just /r/poland ( Although none of the comments I linked were from foreigners, so anyway, if what has been said about it's """"right-wing"""" lean is true ).

&gt;Also that is a Lithuanian

The Lithuanian asked, Otkat, who is Polish answered that the people who own the media are ""descendants of merchants"". Classy.

&gt;all claims for private property in Poland owned by United States citizens before September 1, 1939.

First of all, where is that taken from, and what about other citizens?

&gt;to pay lump-sum compensation on behalf of transnational Jewish organizations like the World Jewish Congress, and the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany.

That doesn't really tell me anything, according to the Congress bill, they're asking for compensation for a return to the ""rightful owner"" of wrongfully seized property, the use of the Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art and the Terezin Declaration in settling claims involving publicly and privately held movable property, the restitution of heirless property and ""progress on the resolution of claims for U.S. citizen"".

So if Poland, according to whichever source you're using, already ""satisfied all claims"" of the resolution, and all the property was destroyed along with the buildings, then what is the problem if this bill were to pass? There would be no progress to make, since all claims were satisfied. No property to return to a rightful owner, since everything was destroyed. Presumably the only objection might be to restitution of heirless property.

Nowhere in this bill is the WJC mentioned, so I can only assume that perhaps any of these organizations are only involved in religious/communal property claims of synagouges or whatever that used to be under WJC ownership or else they will be complying with the U.S Authorities to locate and identify ownership documents and such.

&gt;What the fuck do you want. Spit it out because I don't know what the reverse of a couple of dunces on the internet is, do you want something equally as idiotic.

I want each one of these dunces on the internet to be inconvenienced in any way possible. I want them getting lambasted in the same way they mete out their insults online. Hence why my original post was that if someone like anyone wishes to delay a ""fight with Jews"" for a better timing, I really do hope that these Jews decide to fight him hard right now.

5500,"&gt;We don't know that but

Well yeah but why else would 2 armed soldiers, dressed in uniform, with insignias, carrying their personal phones etc, trespass into Turkey? To spy, or to invade? Come on. It's common knowledge that it has happened many times in the past with lots of soldiers from each side cause there's no fence to separate the border at that point and none was accused of espionage or arrested and detained.

&gt;I'm out of the loop on that too. What happened to them? Did they get a conditional release and live in a civil settlement or are they in military detention?

After the coup, 8 Turkish officers fled to Greece where they were arrested and they applied for political asylum. Turkey asked for them to be returned which would have been the usual thing to do as these men may well indeed be conspirators (assuming the coup was legit and not set up but that's a different story). However, after the massive culling in the Turkish judiciary, education etc systems and generally since everyone and their mothers were being accused of being Gullenists, and with Erdogan proclaiming that he might bring back the death penalty, the Greek judiciary system decided not to extradite them to Turkey because we doubt that they will have a fair trial. 

About their detention, i could be wrong here but i have the impression that they're detained and being watched but i was reading today that 1 of them was set free. Maybe that's the case with others, i'm not sure, feel free to correct me if i'm wrong here.

So your officers applied for asylum and don't want to return to Turkey (either cause they're criminals are cause they might be innocent but believe that their trial wont be fair), while our soldiers trespassed accidentally (unless someone can think of another scenario that makes sense) and they want to return home but Turkey constantly delays the trial.

5546,"History already punished Germany twice for getting hostile to Russia. 

First time when Germany stepped in WWI declaring war on Russia, and keiser empire fell , causing economic misery and ultimately paving the way for the nazi overturn of the Weimar Republic.

Second time when Nazi Germany declared war on USSR and got lured into Russian territory, where they lost so much manpower that the Allies assault in Normandy became possible.

Now we have a new strong Germany , in the center of Europe where they will dominate once the U.K. is out, first economically, then politically. Again, history repeats itself.

Prussia could attain its glory only being allied to Russia , ever since the Great northern war ended Swedish hopes for domination in Northern and Eastern Europe. 

Repeating the same error and turning against Russia can and will be a disaster for Germany again and again and again.

5551,"Spaniards have became richer than Italians — a heartening indication of Spain’s economic revival but a worrying sign for Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy which is stuck in political gridlock. Spain’s per capita gross domestic product exceeded that of Italy in 2017, according to IMF data published this week that compares countries on a so-called “purchasing power parity” basis. The IMF also forecast that Spain would become 7 per cent richer than Italy over the next five years. A decade ago Italy was 10 per cent richer on the same basis. The data and forecasts show the sharply diverging fortunes of two countries that were severely hit by the eurozone economic crisis over the past decade. While Spain is now one of the fastest growing countries among major EU economies, Italy remains an economic laggard.

By 2023 some former Soviet bloc countries, including Slovakia and the Czech Republic, are also expected to become richer than Italy on a per capita basis, the IMF forecasts show. “It’s been since the 16th century that Italy and Spain keep overtaking each other — but they have something on us now,” said Carlo Alberto Carnevale-Maffè, a professor at the school of management at Bocconi University in Milan. “Spain has been on a more robust and convincing growth trajectory than Italy since at least 2011, so this has been coming.” 

Italy’s stagnation is one of the main causes of the country’s increasingly bitter political divisions, with the electorate losing faith in the ability of its traditional parties to create jobs and restore growth. Anti-establishment and protest parties emerged as the big winners of Italy’s inconclusive general election last month, where voters deserted more moderate centre-left and centre-right forces. Italy’s underperformance — and in particular any threat to its ability to service its debt, the largest in the eurozone after Greece’s relative to the size of the economy — is also seen as one of the biggest risks for the single-currency area. Without structural economic improvement Italy “continues to pose a latent threat to the euro area”, said Lieven Noppe, senior economist at KBC, in a recent note. 

The fact that Spain has overtaken Italy owes more to Italy’s problems than Spain’s economic progress, which has only recently gathered pace. While Spain has been expanding at a faster rate than France, Germany and the UK since 2015, its economy is only 2 per cent larger than at the start of 2008 — a weaker recovery than in all other major EU economies except Italy. Román Escolano, the Spanish economy minister, told the Financial Times on Thursday: “The latest results of the Spanish economy are good and encouraging, the latest forecasts from instructions like the IMF as well, but there is still a lot to do. There are still a lot of jobs to create, and we are working on it.” Mr Carnevale-Maffè said Spain had some key structural advantages, such as a younger population, but had also been able to make public investments more effectively than Italy, particularly in infrastructure, and was more open to innovation and foreign investment.

At the end of the 1990s, Italy — which now has almost 15m more people than Spain — had an economy twice as large as that of Spain. It is now only 50 per cent larger and the difference is expected to shrink even further in the next five years. Italy’s economic performance “has been poor since 1999”, said Jack Allen, economist at Capital Economics. Italy’s economy is still only marginally larger than in 2000 while other major EU economies have expanded by 25 per cent or more. Spain’s total output is 35 per cent larger than in 2000.

Separate data from the OECD show that Italy is one of the few major economies that has not yet regained its pre-crisis levels — with a rapidly ageing population, lagging productivity, a cumbersome bureaucracy and high state debt contributing to its poor long-term performance. The IMF said Italian growth of 1.5 per cent last year was the fastest since 2010 and said it expected growth to strengthen this year. However, the election results might mean “that bold reforms are unlikely to materialise” and Italy’s growth potential and outlook “will likely remain below that of its European peers”, said Massimo Bassetti, economist at FocusEconomics, in an analysts’ note. Back in 1997, Italy was the 18th richest economy on a per capita basis among the countries for which the IMF has a complete data set. After 10 years, its ranking dropped 10 positions — and it has now slipped five more positions in the decade to 2017.

5644,"&gt; I slightly disagree. My impression is that there still more than enough people that deny that antisemitism is especially prevalent amongst Muslims and in Muslim countries.

What do you mean by more than enough? Sure those people do exist, but even center-left media has acknowledged that there is a problem with antisemitism in Islam. I don't think that that's controversial at all outside of some leftist university cities.

&gt; There may be a shift of people’s opinions as of late, but it’s still not enough to turn the tide. Seehofer for example caught a lot of flak for his critical comments about Islam and Muslims. Merkel promptly disagreed with him.

Even last year more than half of Germans (55% I believe) said that they would like to stop *all* Muslim immigration. The tide has turned around New Years Eve 2015/2016, when the number of refugees/migrants reached seven digits, that was also when the centrist media become more critical of the subject.

There isn't a lot of disagreement between Merkel and Seehofer, the debate was weather Islam belongs to Germany, which is either objectively true or false, depending on how you read that question. Without defining what that questions means, any debate on that subject is just stupid. Merkel has already said multiple times that she thinks that multiculturalism has failed, she hasn't changed her opinion on that.

Dangerous mentality to have. If you don't care about them, they won't care about you too. And if they don't care about you, then you will have a hard time in cooperating in common challenges. It also means that they might engage in stuff that hurts you and you will have a hard time to convince them not to do it.

You are now debating semantics. That's the bottom of the barrel for any argument.

&gt; It's often associated with Nazism, but the characteristics all fit Islamic extremism/Islamism

The wikipedia article you linked does not mention Islamism as being compatible with Nazism. The word ""Islam"", or any other of its derivatives, doesn't even appear in the article.

This is a straw-man argument.

&gt; Being a German national doesn't exclude being an immigrant.

Actually, according to German law, it does.

The separation between Germans and non-Germans is entirely made based on German citizenship.

&gt; Foreigners or [non-Germans](http://www.krimlex.de/artikel.php?BUCHSTABE=&amp;KL_ID=24) are, in accordance with § 2 (1) of the Residence Act, any person who is not German within the meaning of Article 116 (1) of the Basic Law. Accordingly, foreigners who have neither German citizenship nor German ethnicity. Since people who are willing to naturalise and become German citizens are usually naturalized immediately after entering the Federal territory, only German nationality remains as a criterion of distinction. The group of foreigners staying in Germany is very diverse. **These include vested EU citizens, diplomats, workers and self-employed persons with residence permits, foreigners living abroad, pupils and students, tourists and transients, asylum seekers, tolerated foreigners, foreign armed forces and persons who are staying illegally in Germany.**

Immigrants hold a special place within crime statistics just to dispel any and all prejudice that people may have against them.

For immigrants alone the crime rates are far lower than those of non-Germans. Here's the recent [BKA report](https://www.bka.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/PolizeilicheKriminalstatistik/2016/pks2016ImkBericht.pdf;jsessionid=4E2CFC29B1184111AB82990BAC890E4C.live0611?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=8). 14.8% of assault culprits are immigrants (page 75 in the report).

And [42.6% of foreign nationals in Germany (non-Germans) are EU citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Germany#Population).",Romania,/r/europe/comments/8d9tru/jewish_man_attacked_in_berlin_admits_hes_an/dxmhfwi/,adevland,1524145253

5684,"&gt; Perhaps it's the cold stereotype (which isn't entirely untrue)

Personally i think it is untrue, mainly because it is simply just viewed from another point of view or rather, viewed from a different culture. US and Canada are for obvious reasons similar to the UK with their ""keeping the appearances"" towards the outside. Being polite, no matter what. Spending time on pleasantries as to make the person opposite more comfortable and not to offend that person. So maybe one could say more ""comfort driven"" to that style.  
German style (and probably also prevalent in the countries to the east) is more direct. Barely any time is wasted on pleasantries (with strangers) because those strangers usually appreciate the direct answers as well. No need to pamper them or charm them with pleasantries as, to them, it would seem fake and shallow. Almost like they were trying to hide something behind their pleasantries.  
To the north american the germans are cold and rude, to the german the north american seem fake and shallow.  
A friend of mine who lived in both places had an interesting comparison.   
An American is like a peach, all sweet and juicy on the outside, but a hard centre that needs time to get through. A German is like a coconut (or a banana if you will). You'll need time getting through the outside but once you're through you'll get all there is.  
  
Neither style is wrong, and neither stile is right. They're just different.

5738,"I know Church members played a role in the revival of the Gaelic Games \- not to mention the many priests who played a prominent role in the struggle for Independence so it only makes sense that many clergy would be at the forefront of language revival \- although I'm honestly not well versed on the latter. I certainly would not say that the Church is the reason Irish is dead \(the decline began when the Church was still an illegal institution!\) \- emigration was the main cause by far!

The school system established in Ireland in the 1800s by Westminster has long been linked to language decline \(students were reportedly beaten if they spoke English\) and from the mid to late 1800s, the Catholic Church largely assumed control of most of these schools as smaller denominations pulled out in areas where there were few Protestants. The Church may therefore be as complicit as the State Schools \- but in some areas I've heard parents were demanding education in English to increase their kids opportunities.

An interesting article here seems to challenge the alleged hostility of the Church towards the language \-

[http://www.drb.ie/essays/gaelic\-and\-catholic\-](http://www.drb.ie/essays/gaelic-and-catholic-)

However another article here states that the clergy had 'literary' Irish and struggled to actually speak with the locals. Maybe the Church tried but was still failing the people. But this Irish was for protelysing not preservation.

&gt; Everything I point to in regards to Turkey's past and Turkey's past applications is written in historical record (in addition to our own experience of it).

But the connection you tie to current political parties is entirely constructed. Like where you try to blame 28 Şubat on Ecevit/CHP whereas Erdoğan's buddies had a bigger hand in it. I also disputed the historical accuracy of some of your allegations.

&gt; You came up with an argument crying for democracy with a call for non-democratic ways to bring it down.

I did no such thing. Prove it. Show me the evidence. I never spoke for forceful regime change.

Drawing swastikas on synagogues is usually on record as ""crime motivated by extreme right ideology"" and not as ""crime motivated by islamist / antisemitic ideology"" and police as well as intelligence are starting to see this as a problem because it heavily skews statistics towards the right as long as the perpetrators are unknown.

5790,"Yes ... and it *is* kind of mind blowing!

That's would be 3000 years back give or take a century. That's almost a *millennium*(!) before the time of '*Christ*'. And, that site, upon which the temple would be built, had apparently been considered sacred close to yet another millennium before that, before the dedication of that temple.  

And yet .... it all seems strangely familiar. As bizarre as this may seem ... one can feel closer in nobility of spirit to those who dedicated this temple so long ago than to the mentality of some people today ... to ISIS/IS (Islamic State) followers for example. Just consider that this temple was dedicated during a time when a man called Pericles could speak such words:

&gt;'*Our form of government does not enter into rivalry with the institutions of others. Our government does not copy our neighbors', but is an example to them. It is true that we are called a Democracy, for the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.*

&gt;*But while there exists equal justice to all and alike in their private disputes, the claim of excellence is also recognized; and when a citizen is in any way distinguished, he is preferred to the public service, not as a matter of privilege, but as the reward of merit.*

&gt;*Neither is poverty an obstacle, but a man may benefit his country whatever the obscurity of his condition. There is no exclusiveness in our public life, and in our private business we are not suspicious of one another, nor angry with our neighbor if he does what he likes; we do not put on sour looks at him which, though harmless, are not pleasant.*

&gt;*While we are thus unconstrained in our private business, a spirit of reverence pervades our public acts; we are prevented from doing wrong by respect for the authorities and for the laws, having a particular regard to those which are ordained for the protection of the injured as well as those unwritten laws which bring upon the transgressor of them the reprobation of the general sentiment...*'! 

[Pericles's Funeral Oration (Jowett\)](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Pericles%27s_Funeral_Oration_(Jowett\))

Apparently, a higher/civilised spirit is not a necessary occurrence, something that's just a matter of the passing of time. It seems to require willpower, discipline, effort and courage. Even one or two generations without those things ... and it can be lost ... possibly for ever more.

&gt; None of my freedoms are taken (or any average citizen) and while OHAL is a shitty thing, it's been a long part of Turkey's life before Erdogan too.

And it's part of Turkey's life now. The OHAL expressly removes your freedoms. That's its whole purpose. You are welcome to try protesting against the government right now. And even if you could (you can't), that doesn't mean you have a freedom. A freedom is a _right_ that can't be taken away, not a privilege granted by the ruling government.

This nationwide OHAL is the first in Turkey's history. There has never been one. The past ones were only for the southeast.

&gt; It is valid. The opposition politicians still bring nothing to the table except for empty arguments and criticism

This is a lie. You are welcome to read the other parties election proposals rather than just watch TV-news. They have all offered different (and usually better) policies, it's just that the outlandish rhetoric is what actually gets heard because that's how things work.

And it isn't valid. The sentence that follows doesn't qualify this: ""the parties of today can be judged solely by their predecessors actions 20-30 years ago""

&gt; which is why they lose election after election

It isn't. No election has been fair since the AKP took control of the media.

&gt; And despite losing election after election, they don't even make way for newer faces with better ideas to take over.

Kılıçdaroğlu has been party leader for 8 years. He has actually stabilized the party and gained back some of its votes. He isn't even supposed to win half the votes, just represent the section of society that conforms to the principles of the party.

They are, way more than the AKP. CHP has the most democratic party bylaws among relevant parties.

&gt; Anytime someone in their party challenges them, they kick him/her out of the party or disrepute them.

This is a lie. If ""anytime someone in their party challenges them, they kick him/her out of the party"", Muharrem İnce wouldn't still be an influential CHP member.

5825,"Right, but we are arguing here about ""should abortion be legal in any case, at any point in the pregnancy"", the actual details of this, and when the abortion can be performed (12 weeks? Earlier? later?) and in what circumstances (Only in cases of rape, or in cases where the mothers life is in danger? Only if the fetus is deformed/disabled, etc) can be dealt with later. The current referendum is simply asking whether the ban on abortion should be lifted, it's *NOT* talking about the details of the new legislation, when a foetus becomes a human being, etc, etc.

The only people who would have an issue with the ""Yes"" campaign are people who believe that ""life begins at conception"" and that ""all abortion, regardless of the cause"" is murder, and those people, honestly, I feel are fundamentalists who are at odds with science and reason and medical ethics.

Personally, I feel that once the foetus becomes developed enough to survive on its own, outside the womb, (even with medical intervention) abortion becomes more difficult to justify. However, before that, a foetus is entirely dependent on a womans body for support, it is not a life in its own right, it is living off of the mother, and she has a right to terminate that life support if she wishes.

That is a good argument, because it deals with morality properly, instead of going all out stalinism on more then half the population. If you hate abortions so much, just don't do it.

Therefore (Non-withstanding the still rampant problem of non-consensuality in procreation), if a woman wants to have unprotected sex, it's not your or the states business. Funnily you seem to not care about the dudes involvement, why not force him to have a vasectomy, it's his fetus too after all, and if he's done it once he'll certainly gonna do it again, that filthy bastard should be prevented from causing abortions in the future, shouldn't he?

I value your arguments, because you seem to have a quite practical point of view and obviously wouldn't fall for the typical made-up facts agenda the eurosceptics love to spread. You're rational as in you realize leaving is a bad idea even though there's many things that you'd do differently. And sadly, it's become an expectation to just have an argument dissolve to blatant racism or populism a few comments deep.  
With that said, what baffles me about your comments is your language: The EU would have a ""death wish"" if it did something you didn't like; there's some kind of elite that is incapable of  seeing  reality, yet you never specified what that reality of yours actually is; and I'm a fanatic for mitigating your bleak outlook (not that I mind, but dangerously, you're quick to classify everyone who holds an opinion similar to mine as a fanatic, too). This sort of paints this binary picture of impending doom one the one side and the status quo, or better yet, the good old days on the other. What I mean by this is not that progressionism is inevitable, but that it makes the discussion about it unnecessarily black and white. Yet there probably isn't a better example in recent decades than the European project to show that in reality, politics is a broad field somewhere in between total failure and idealistic visions",Bavaria (Germany),/r/europe/comments/8cltdy/on_this_day_15_years_agoczech_republic_estonia/dxm8e72/,haldayn_fre_si,1524130732

A little counter argument to that: If the labor costs in the agriculture sector rises, so does the cost to the consumers. 

This could (dunno if it actually will or not, it's just a possible issue) result in the goods produced rising to such a monetary value that importing produce from abroad is cheaper than locally produced ones. So it could mean that the produce is harvested by the same people, with the difference being the country of origin.

i live in a former comunist country and that outlawed abortions back then, and now they are legal, you just have to pay for it. the thing is before this, they feared the system and they would take plenty of care not to get pregnant, (you could still do a abortion, but was pretty hard to get in, because there were kinda a control from the doctors and spies that would rat on you if you did). and there were far less unwanted pregnancies back then in the poor community then they are now, when abortion is legal. 

and also, the poor communities also have a bigger rate of STD's because of the lack of protection. 

the abortion as a mean to say ""she didn't wanted, i'm ok with it"" is like saying that the ""tv is bad for your kids/tv should be for kids"", cuz you can't take the time to properly educate them and leave them with the tv. out of sight out of mind kind of deal.

5994,"To clarify since some users seem to misunderstand the rules of /r/Europe and/or deliberately misrepresent them to prove a non-existent point:

* 1) A ""Local News""-rule [does not exist](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules#wiki_disallowed_submissions.3A), has not existed for at least a year and not a single submission was removed under such a rule.

* 2) A ""Local Crime""-rule *does* exist. 

* 3) In isolation the incident in question is ""Antisemitic violent attack happened"" and represents ~1/30 cases in Germany per year at the moment. In the early 2000s this was closer to the 50s. Crime is common in the end and individual cases are not relevant on a pan-European scale.

* 3.1) No, personal dislike for any specific type of perpetrator committing crime does not justify an exception to this rule. Note that ""Meta- or longitudinal studies"" are also explicitly exempt and perfect places to talk about these factors in general.

* 4) If the leader of a nation gets involved with comments, international media takes interest and/or the story gets a rather unique twist with the ""It was just a prank kind of but not really""-angle it certainly does *not* fall under our ""Local Crime""-rule anymore which is why both this article and the [""I'm actually an Arab""](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8d9tru/jewish_man_attacked_in_berlin_admits_hes_an/)-stories are still up.

* 5) When you *do* find a story that you believe should be removed under these rules please report it to us and/or shoot us a modmail if we seem to not be acting on reports. We sometimes make mistakes, misunderstand context or (most often) simply miss topics because they're not reported and/or gather no attention in the first place.
