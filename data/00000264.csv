Assuming the governments just roll over and accept having no control over currency (and they won't. They're more likely to make it illegal for businesses to accept them), that's a changeover that would take at least a decade.

84,"&gt; Shanwick is International airspace, which NATS control under contract from ICAO

... in some cooperation with the Irish authority, yes, I'm aware of that.  

&gt; it is not sovereign UK airspace by any stretch

I don't believe I made any such assertion.  In fact, I addressed that in [this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/7bnjh4/oc_postbrexit_aviation_issues_an_informed_laymans/dqb9vp9/).  Under Chicago Art. 1, sovereign airspace is limited to geographic territory (+ 12 nm, AIUI) but the UK is nevertheless responsible for flights under Shanwick ATC until ICAO says otherwise, so it makes little difference in Class A and C airspace or to any a/c flying under IFR (regardless of meteorological conditions) whether it is sovereign or not.

Whether ICAO could feasibly redelegate responsibility to another authority depends on who owns the HF radio, radar and other equipment and also the preparedness and capacity of the new authority for taking over oceanic control duties.  Although doubtless possible, it would probably be easier, quicker and less expensive to settle the spat between the UK and EU over the matter — particularly when restoration of current coöperation is inevitable in due course — so it's not safe to assume that ICAO would act or even contemplate redelegation of authority for Shanwick FIR.

Besides, ICAO is an organ of the UN and therefore supposed to be impartial.  If it intervened the Shanwick matter, it would likely be obliged to intervene in the matter of UK use of EU airspace because the superficial basis of denial either way is the credibility of the aviation authorities involved and therefore air safety (even if everyone knows that, in truth, it is politically motivated).

For ICAO to intervene, it would have to do so in terms of air safety (because otherwise, NATS is only doing its job by enforcing regulations) and therefore reciprocal recognition of aviation authority competence because there's no credible reason for either authority to doubt the standards of the other after more than half a century of coöperation.  It won't be interested in engaging at a political level, so an alternative consequence to ICAO intervention is that both UK and EU pilots, airlines and aircraft would end up with use of each other's airspace just as they always have (subject to whatever the new ASA arrangements permit, of course).  End of problem.

Who knows, maybe ICAO might be able to help expedite restoration of current arrangements in this already unlikely hypothetical.

Resolution could be very simple: the UK would argue that it ardently desires to re-establish reciprocity with EASA, and that the situation arose only in response to EASA's inexplicable failure to maintain reciprocity, especially in view of the fact that the UK was a member of EASA until very recently.  ICAO might then ask EASA what obstruction there is to restoring previous arrangements.  That puts the pressure on EASA to resolve the situation (and, politically, makes EASA and, by extention, the EU look like the aggressor).

Ultimately, ICAO is an administrative body that is governed by international treaty, which means any of its contracting states have recourse before the ICJ.  It is therefore answerable for its actions and not free to act arbitrarily or capriciously.",,/r/europe/comments/7bnjh4/oc_postbrexit_aviation_issues_an_informed_laymans/dsnmlbt/,StrixTechnica,1515911695

107,"If we are talking about the actual ethnic boundaries around the time of the treaty, regardless of any historical claims and such, then the situation at the time of the Second Vienna Award is the most fair distribution (you can google a map anytime). Those were the predominantly Hungarian areas even in the 30s and by 'predominantly' I mean 80-90% Hungarian population. Hungarians lived in other places too but as 50% or less, so leave them. That's a damn huge area, more than half of modern Hungary. There's a reason why literally one-third of Hungarians found themselves outside ot their own country suddenly (again: I'm not talking about lost territory but the amount of ethnic Hungarians). Btw both awards were internationally recognized and legal, they nullified them after WWII for Stalin's request and... well, long story, you can do your research.

So, it wasn't 'correct that a bit to Hungary's disfavor' but it was an unusually very hard punishment with cutting third of a nation and their homeland off.

But those days are gone as - despite signed agreement about minority rights and autonomy - every country from Slovakia to Romania did very serious moves to get rid of their Hungarians, even destroying whole villages and such. In the case of Romania you can read about this period in Greater Romania: Regionalism, Nation Building, and Ethnic Struggle by Irina Livezeanu, a Romanian-born American history professor at the University of Pittsburg (so definietly not 'Hungarian propaganda'). Sure, most of you other European guys don't know about these things because 1. you can't care less 2. the actual Romanian political elite put a lot of effort in painting a very different picture to the public.

At the result of these, the Hungarian minority in those countries is just a fracture of its original size nowadays. So, a revision is pretty impossible today and actually nobody wants it except a few far-right activists. But still about 1.3 million Hungarians live in Romania, even after that terrible century (mind: that's the population of Estonia) and most of them in Seklerland. Though forming a land-bridge to re-annex the region would be possible, nobody asked for this or even planned it, it's out of question. All what they want is regional autonomy what actually all the treaties of Trianon and Paris, the Romanian constitution and EU law provide rights for (just like Catalunia, Tirol, Wales, etc.). That really isn't that much in this situation. But the Romanian government does everything to make it impossible and to oppress most of their minority rights in practice (even putting a damn flag on a building...).

About that's the reality of the Treaty nowadays and if you didn't know this or listened to some Romanian - or even Hungarian - propaganda, maybe you understand now a bit more that why a sentence like this is like throwing an oil can to the fire, practically.",,/r/europe/comments/7pqqx3/romanias_prime_minister_threatens_transylvanian/dsng4tz/,Eunones,1515901754

Pinging /u/rerecursing, /u/fiftythreefiftyfive, and /u/kiduncool because, well, they happened to be the people whose names I noticed along the way:

People are considering a number of totally different questions here.

The one that seems natural to start with me is ""Given two equally pleasant nations, one big and one small, how much immigration would you expect between them?"". To that, the answer is that you should expect the same number of people going in either direction, regardless of how big or small they are. Even if the answer sounds unintuitive in general, you can easily construct examples of how other answers (certainly ""the same fraction of each nation's population should emigrate"") result in completely ridiculous numbers. Thus, you end up with the same absolute numbers going in either direction, but a much smaller fraction of the bigger nation's population emigrating than of the smaller's.

The next question to ask based on that is: Okay, now adjust by one nation being slightly more pleasant than the other. What happens in terms of migration now? 

I would say: There would be a slight change in migration rates, to favor the more pleasant nation. But that's for reasons that are outside the realm of pure mathematics. If people could just move without any cost or disruption to wherever life is the most pleasant, then there *would* be an immediate massive migration. But it's not that easy to move to a foreign nation, and most people never do it at all. and you often need a specific opportunity that 's personally suitable for you, and those just turn up less in a smaller nation. And richer nations tend to be less willing to take in people, too. Anyway, even with the changes to the absolute numbers, if the difference in pleasantness is small, but the difference in the nations' sizes is large, then you're still going to see a much smaller emigration rate in the big than the small nation.

And it's only after that that we get to the question that a lot of people here are starting with: ""Given a really really really tiny fraction of US citizens are moving to Norway, and a much bigger fraction of Norwegian citizens are moving to the US, doesn't that mean that the US is actually the more pleasant place?""

And to that, I'm afraid the answer has to be that *you're starting in the wrong place*. The numbers simply don't mean what you think they mean, and you have to actually do your reasoning all the way from the start to understand what they do mean. Forget that the base rates of emigration should differ, and you would get all the world's smallest nations rapidly filling up with citizens. Forget that a small difference in pleasantness should cause a small difference in absolute migration rate, and you end up with everyone moving to wherever is the coolest place in the world. Only once you've taken those into account can you even start trying to reason about what those differences in emigration rates mean.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/7q38ux/more_americans_move_to_norway_than_the_other_way/dsngsvh/,Ari_Rahikkala,1515902607

In case of Finland this is super no no, since bank credentials and bank log in are used (as one option in addition to government I'd cards or SIM card based authentication) for strong authentication for government services. 

Meaning if I would give my bank credentials to Sofort, Trustly they could go to government services, request using bank credentials as identification, get kicked to banks website, put in those credentials. 

Hey presto they could see my population registry information, my electronic medication recipes, my land ownings, my vehicle register, see government communications with me etc.

Not sure if you mean non-EU or not so I'll tell you what I  see there...

Non-EU:

UK is an island and outside Schengen, meaning pretty sovereign control over its borders. I really fail to see what would you want EU to do more.

EU:

This is about workers from poor EU countries (Poles etc.). 

First, let me remind you, that when Poland etc. entered the EU, UK was one of the few Western countries that immediately opened the doors to them working in UK, whereas the majority continued the work visa regime.

Now... that provision does not exist anymore and the labour movement is total. I am asking you, who is employing them? By and large, it is British businesses, owned by Brits. If no job, they can't live un UK. And don't tell me that they just come in and claim dole, because first they don't, and second, even if they did, how dole works is UK-specific, not mandated by the EU. The only good reason for a British business to employ a random Pole, *with whom it will be harder to communicate and who will possibly need to learn to do the job*, is that the Pole is cheaper. But then, it is, by and large[1], British government's economic policies and labour market regulations and practices who decide the wages, so British government should make it so that the random Pole is not more ""attractive"" than a random Brit!

[1] EU cares about discrimination.

So... what, concretely, would you like EU to do about it, that your own government can't (or rather, what it could, but failed, to do)?",,/r/europe/comments/7q48qp/do_you_think_eu_should_focus_more_on_media/dsnie8w/,Gotebe,1515904737

189,"&gt;It should represent international law where if it isnt allowed by UN it cant happen.

Well, anyone can establish a court that claims the ability to make binding rulings without the consent of the parties involved.

If you wanted to do so, you could set up such a court in your basement.  Rule on various events around your neighborhood.

However, it's a pretty good bet that nobody is going to be very interested in its rulings.  It has no enforcement ability, and nobody has a reason to consent to grant it authority in general.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government

&gt;A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, often a state.[1] In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislature, administration, and judiciary. Government is a means by which state policies are enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining the policy.

What you want is to set up a world government, not a forum.  And you don't want to grant the permanent UNSC members special status in it, right?  Because you view that as a more-desirable allocation of power in the world.

The problem is that the existing permanent UNSC members are quite happy with the state of affairs.  So they are unlikely to consent to the jurisdiction of your new system.

Of course, you could force them to submit to your system.  But there is no collection of countries on Earth today that can compel the United Kingdom, France, the United States of America, Russia, and China to unwillingly submit to the authority of a different system.

""But I live in a government, and everyone has equal rights here!  Countries should do the same!""

You live in a government which grants equal rights because in your country, everyone has approximately equal ability to do harm to others.  So the government models this in the power it extends to individuals.  And thus, by resolving conflicts via government, we avoid having to fight out our disputes.

Hobbes recognized the concept in *Leviathan* and used it in constructing his basic rationale for the existence of government:

&gt;Following the compositive aspect of his methodology, Hobbes ""combines"" individuals in a state of nature, a state prior to the formation of the commonwealth. In the ""natural condition of mankind,"" humans are equal, despite minor differences in strength and mental acuity. Hobbes's notion of equality is peculiar in that it refers to the equal ability to kill or conquer one another, but quite consistent with his notion of power. This equality, Hobbes says, naturally leads to conflict among individuals for three reasons: competition, distrust, and glory. In the first case, if two individuals desire a scarce commodity, they will compete for the commodity and necessarily become enemies. In their efforts to acquire desired objects, each person tries to ""destroy or subdue"" the other. On account of the constant fear produced in the state of nature, Hobbes believes, it is reasonable to distrust others and use preemptive strikes against one's enemies. Hobbes also considers humans to be naturally vainglorious and so seek to dominate others and demand their respect. The natural condition of mankind, according to Hobbes, is a state of war in which life is ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"" because individuals are in a ""war of all against all"" (L 186).

But if you form a government where power in the government is proportional to do harm — about equal, for all individuals — then you can fight a simulation of a ""war"", as happens when people vote, without needing the costly war.

If you have a government in which power is greatly disproportionate to ability to do harm, then the government is unstable: its members have reason and ability to overthrow it.

(Note that this same rationale can be seen in the American right to bear arms: no elite can reserve power to a few and establish a tyranny, because it cannot gather to itself greatly disproportionate ability to do harm.  The right to bear arms was seen as a final guarantee of equal democratic power.)

The UNSC-based system today exists, like governments — to avoid conflicts, to reduce them to legal processes.  And so it models its political power on the ability to do harm.  If it did otherwise, it would tend to fall apart.

Its goal is to avoid World War III by ""simulating"" it in disputes, and avoiding having to fight it.  And so far, it has avoided world war rather better than the prior state of affairs, when we kicked off the 20th century with two of them.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7q519s/this_photo_was_taken_last_week_in_eastern_ukraine/dsnivh4/,vokegaf,1515905392

Ljubljana is one of the most beautiful and well-planned capital cities on the planet -- I can't think of a single U.S. city with such nice infrastructure and pleasant quality of life.

I had a Slovene girl drive me around her country -- honestly, I literally -- even on the Russian road in the mountains -- could not find a single pot hole. Then, when she took me to the coast, I wanted to cry when we drove through these incredible modern tunnels. 

And, of course, Slovenes have free (decent) university education and good health care. 

Slovenia's GDP per capita is US$10,000 less than the ""shithole states"" of America (about $21,000) -- Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, etc. -- but yet it has the nice public goods and social infrastructure you'd expect to find in Norway or Denmark (with GDP per capita around $60-$70,000).

244,"It probably has lagged a bit.  That being said, no non-UNSC permanent members have had second-strike capability historically, which might be an important line.  All permanent members do.  So even permanent members cannot war against permanent members without willingness to accept tremendous damage.

If India wants to press the issue, they might get on it.

Germany — which wants influence there — will not get one, though, barring federalizing with France and inheriting her seat.

* The UNSC is presently loaded toward Europe.  The two European members, France and the UK, are probably proportionally-weaker than they were when being added, and that's already two seats.  In foreign affairs, Europe is more-or-less aligned anyway.

* No existing permanent member will want to permit any new member in, as it is disadvantageous towards themselves.  Yes, I know that France says that she wants Germany in.  She doesn't — she'd infinitely rather have Germany go through her.  Germany receiving a seat would only mean that Germany would gain the option of vetoing when it conflicts with France's interests and reduce France's value to Germany.

    And no non-permanent member coalition is going to force the issue against the permanent members.

* Germany's at a nadir militarily, on top of not having such capability.

The real point here is that the UNSC isn't there to ""redistribute power"".  It's intended to approximate hard power.  And Germany is going to have a hard time claiming that she represents something that the major military powers cannot afford to militarily-cross.

294,"&gt;Should welfare states be based on feelings or efficiency? 

Politics is philosophy made form, and as such, the runnings of a society should be based on the beliefs and feelings of said society. Everyone wants efficiency, but often what we actually want must come first. 

&gt;https://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/about/Pages/overview.aspx

The NHS deals with 1 million patients every 36 hours and everybody in the country goes to see their GP at least a couple times a year: If you are older it could be every month or so, and all expensive prescriptions get covered (well, you have to pay £8 for them, but you might be paying that for medicine worth hundreds of pounds). 

&gt;https://peopleshistorynhs.org/encyclopaedia/born-in-the-nhs/
One example would be:
97% of people since 1948 have been born in an NHS hospital. 

About 30% of people get cancer in their lifetime and of those who get treatment will also almost always go to the NHS (unless its extremely urgent, most people avoid private when they can despite it being *nicer*.)

To not waste your valuable free time, I'll limit myself to the Anti-Trump protestors. Looks like they want to achieve that Trump does not attend the Davos meeting. Or maybe they want to provoke a stupid tweet by Trump. Who knows for sure. Maybe they just don't like Trump and want to show that to the world. 

The motives to attend such protests are quite widespread. 

&gt; They went to streets to protest against president that is the president of another country, they r not even on the same continent? Just be realistic.

Realistically the opposition from locals was one of the reasons, if not the main reason, Trump cancelled his February visit to London.

First they planted [reed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_(plant\)), sown from airplanes. It sucks the last bit of salt water out of the ground, it has long roots so it loosens the ground, and it grows so fast that it prevents other, unwanted plants from growing. After that the reed is removed by lighting it on fire. The ash was then plowed into the ground, and is used to grow the second plant: [rapeseed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapeseed). It can grow on salty ground, and has long roots that loosen up the soil better than a plow ever could. Lastly, [alfalfa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfalfa) is sowed, which binds nitrogen into the soil, making it useful farmland.

431,"* The East/West situation is a bit complicated. Generally we think of ourselves as just Germans, not East or West Germans and I don't think a German would get much hate in the other half of the country but there is a lot of disagreement and sometimes resentment on political topics.

* English proficiency is decent among young people (It's a mandatory subject at schools.)
Many people have horrible accents and make lots of mistakes switching up German and  or sentence structures but the vast majority of younger people knows enough to get by. Among older people it's not quite as good, especially in the east where many had Russian at school instead.

* I've not lived in the anglosphere but during my visits I got by by just making huge smiles at everyone talking to me and trying to copy their level of enthusiasm during smalltalk. On vacation it was fine even refreshing sometimes but I'm not sure I would be able to keep it up for longer periods of time.

* German engineering is definetly good. German companies generally are able to stick to the intended tolerances on blueprints really closely making the products very reliable. My dad who repairs construction machines often tells me that the British or Italian excavators at their company often have problems with the engine or hydraulics system every few months while the German or Japanese ones usually get by without issues for years at a time even if they are the same model from the same company, just produced in different countries. Another major factor here is that Germany has lots of small to medium sized companies specialised in really specific things (like producing machines that produce shoes or something) with experience that no one else can match in their area.

* American sitcoms like How I met your Mother  or Big Bang Theory are actually pretty popular in Germany too. British stuff like Monty Python too. I don't know where that idea of Germans having no humor came from because our sense of humor isn't that different to be honest. 

* We aren't robots but we heavily differentiate between practical and private conversations. Basically if the reason you talk to someone is because you need something from them it is not perceived as rude to just get straight to the point without any artificial friendliness. Friendliness is reserved to the people we talk to because we know them and like talking to them, but with friends we are not any less friendly than in those in other countries.

* Asians should not have any issues with racism for the most part. With Turks and Africans it's a bit different. Most people will still be friendly but probably a bit wary and might try to keep their distance. Open racism is relatively rare outside a few areas in eastern Germany but passive racism does exist. Oh and the existing racism is almost entirely culture based, not race based.

* LGTB is a non issue for most of the country at least in public. A few years back we had a gay foreign minister and hardly anyone cared. All in all while we still are far from perfect in that regard Germany is an above average place for LGBT people and things are going the right way.

* We're not as prudish as the UK but not quite as open about it as places like Amsterdam or Prague. Our most popular (and populist) newspaper has a woman with naked breasts on the second page each day (it used to be the front page until a few years ago)

471,"It seems fitting that the untimely death of Peter Sutherland this week should have occurred on the eve of the 100th anniversary of President Woodrow Wilson’s 14 Points speech.

The former Irish politician served as the European Union’s competition commissioner during the 1980s when the rules for the EU single market were set, and then as the founding director general of World Trade Organization in the 1990s. Mr. Sutherland is rightly considered one of the architects of the modern rules-based trading system, laying the ground for the triumphant phase of globalization that lasted until the onset of the world-wide financial crisis.

But the origins of that trading system can be traced to Mr. Wilson’s speech on Jan. 8, 1918, in which he laid down the principles he believed should underpin the postwar order. These included the “removal of all economic barriers…and the establishment of equality of trading conditions” and the right of the peoples of European empires to “autonomous development.” He also proposed “a general association of nations…for the purpose of allowing guarantees of political independence to great and small countries alike.”

Of course, it took decades for a version of Wilson’s vision to come to fruition. Although new states emerged out of the ashes of the Austro-Hungarian, Russian and Ottoman empires, the world order that emerged from the Treaty of Versailles proved highly unstable. Punitive damages imposed on Germany put intolerable stains on a global economic system, based on the gold standard, that eventually collapsed. In the ensuring economic misery caused by beggar-thy-neighbor protectionism, weak new states succumbed to nationalism, dictatorship and border disputes that escalated into war.

Only after the World War II did multilateral institutions come into being that would allow small states to survive and prosper: the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the WTO’s forerunner), the International Monetary Fund, and the European Coal and Steel Community, which became the EU. The key to the success of this post-World War II system was that the new institutions had real rule-making power, unlike the prewar League of Nations, which the U.S. itself never even joined.

These days, almost everybody professes to believe in the “global rules-based trading system.” But it isn’t always clear if they mean it. Brexiters, for example, talk enthusiastically about global trade but seem to have a problem with it being rules-based. Their demand that new trade deals be based upon mutual recognition rather than the EU system of harmonized standards often sounds like a call for a world in which the U.K. should be able to set its own rules, which the rest of the world should be obliged to respect.

Indeed, their constant evocations of Britain’s glorious history as a “great free-trading nation” recalls exactly such a world in which the British Parliament mostly set the rules of 19th-century global trade and the ultimate dispute-resolution mechanism was the Royal Navy.

U.S. President Donald Trump also claims to support the global free-trading system. His new National Security Strategy, published in December, says the international economic system the U.S. and its allies built over the past 70 years “continues to serve our interests.” But it goes on to make clear that this support is conditional on the system being reformed to protect American workers and innovation and to address trade imbalances. At the core of the new strategy is the belief that American prosperity and security is being challenged by unfair competition from China.

Like the Brexiters, Mr. Trump wants to rewrite the rules of global trade to suit what he sees as American interests. He has already withdrawn the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal agreed among 11 countries bordering the Pacific Ocean, and has said he would either renegotiate or withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. He is frustrating the working of the WTO by blocking the appointment of new judges to its appeals tribunals. Meanwhile Washington, citing national-security grounds, is threatening to impose punitive tariffs on a range of Chinese imports, thereby inviting retaliation on the basis that such measures would amount to discrimination.

Mr. Trump is right that China has never fully played by the rules it sign up for when it joined the WTO in 2001. It is also true that its large-scale state subsidies to certain sectors have caused real economic harm in the U.S. and Europe, even as American and European consumers have benefited from cheaper Chinese products. Similarly, Brexiters may be right that some EU regulation is too inflexible and discourages innovation.

But the key question is whether Mr. Trump’s America First agenda—and the Brexiters’ de facto Britain First version—will improve the operation of the global economic system or undermine it.

If the global rules-based trading system is weakened, the biggest losers will be those smaller states that have flourished in the era of globalization—not least Mr. Sutherland’s Ireland. More broadly, however, a world in which doubts emerge about the rule of international law—one in which even large countries question how far they can rely on markets to provide them with food and resources—will be an inherently a more unstable and dangerous place for everyone, including the U.S. and U.K.

Mr. Sutherland’s untimely passing and the 100th anniversary of Woodrow Wilson’s 14 points is a good moment to reflect on this reality, before it is too late.

488,"Farmers started deforestation. When the Neolithic disaster began in the Middle East, that was the first large sustained deforestation event committed by humanity. As farmers and their descendants moved into Europe, they took deforestation with them. By about 6000 BC Europe was already seeing large-scale deforestation. Farmers produce more offspring, because they are needed for more labor-intensive work. Every generation, farmers need to expand to grow more to feed larger populations, which requires cutting down more and more tracts of forest. Animal agriculture is worse. It provokes humans into committing acts of mass extinction, against wolves and bears and other predators who threaten livestock, and even against herbivores like the buffalo and the aurochs. Animal agriculture also creates conditions of disease, cuts off the migration routes that keep ecosystems healthy, and often keeps animals in squalid, deplorable conditions.

The indigenous peoples in the Americas and Australia recognized these behaviors, which is why they resisted farming invasions so staunchly.

Of course it's a mixed blessing, as farming also ultimately brought us such man-made wonders as Copenhagen.

Good on Europe for regrowing its forests.

But it's not free market? it's highly regulated? without being a public service which is a terrible system

&gt;You will. Obviously. But in the end, unless you are really, really rich, you will still end up paying less than what you would have to pay for a comparable education in the US. Simple as that. Let's say during your lifetime, you earn 3 million euros. You will pay the highest tax rate, currently 42% in Germany. That ends up as roughly 1,3 million in taxes, of which roughly 4% are going into education (which doesn't only include univiersities, but that way its easier to do the math). So throughout your life, that's 52.000€. If you want to tell me you can get an anywhere near decent education for that in the US, you are lying.

What about things a simple tax like a sales tax a lot of things is 19% (i think 7% for food) where the highest state sales tax is 11% in the US. The coporate tax is also 8% higher in Germany.

On a side note you gotta remember these Americans are basically paying for the army that protects Germany and they use a lot of money in stupid wars right now, there public services would help cut Taxes a lot, if they stopped acting like the protector of the world.

544,"&gt; they have the same anthem as it was during NSDAP ruling, but they skip singing the first verse

The nazis meaning for germany is often a bit overstated. They are a pretty short period of germany, only 12 years. The german anthmen was declared in 1922 and is even older.

The anthem itself is just the third verse of the Deutschlandlied. We also cut out the second verse, which makes it a lot more compact.   
It is right that nationalism was cut down on purpose during the BRD's founding, though, eg the entire constitution was written much more universal and pragmatic. Particuarly the latter worked out so well it inspired a lot of other countries.

&gt;totally left-wing, pro LGBT, had Love Parades

That's often a bit misunderstood. Germany has a tradition of solidarity, which is held high by basically any party, but otherwise there is also a lasting, conservative mindset. The conservative CDU was ruling party for 2/3rd of the BRD. 

A mix of subdued nationalism, social solidarity and moderate conservatism lead to a bit of pragmatism when it comes to social questions, which makes it eg pretty hard to oppose LGBT; but the powerful CDU still managed to block same sex marriage for quite a long time.

I'm a bit more left and most people I know tend to be too, but hey, the success of the CDU tells a tale.

&gt;they apparently love multi-culti or at least your elites do

Generally yes. At least as long as it doesn't become a problem (rude mannerisms and macho, criminality, etc). Bit of politeness and live and let live mentality.

If the central government just refuses to negotiate then you're damned if you do damned if you don't (eg Hamidian massacres and how everything spiralled from there).  If Armenians would wait for their neighbours to respect those kinds of human rights, Armenians would already be like the Assyrians and Udi.

There are also big questions here about whether and why a central ie foreign government is relevant in the first place.  I don't think there was a point in history where the people of Artsakh legally agreed to that horrible arrangement, so it was an illegitimate occupation all along.

Anyway my original point was not moral or legal or claiming they're saints but that they themselves prefer non-recognition to being occupied and/or dead.

Compared to what? Botswana? The American healthcare system is essentially a continuation of the wild west. Seriously, explain to me, if the free market system (and the US system is, in the end) is so mazing, why literally everything is more expensive for everyone. Why there's a higher infant mortality rate, longer waiting times, less doctors per capita, less specialized doctors per capita, lower life expectancy etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. The llist of things were the US, when it comes to healthcare, scores among developing countries or worse is absolutely endless.

&gt; On a side note you gotta remember these Americans are basically paying for the army that protects Germany

Lol. No, they are paying for American power projection in the Pacific and the ability to fight three full-scale, conventional wars at the same time. They pay jack shit for European defense. Scapegoat argument.

Several thousand? What is your source? I could find [this](https://www.statista.com/statistics/585088/population-of-luxembourg-by-nationality/): 2,5K North Americans (Canadians included, I guess). In proportion, we should have just 4 Luxembourgers in the US(+Canada), which is not really likely anyway.

So yes, this kind of ""logic"" doesn't work even when considering a rich, attractive country - even though it does narrow the gap, but this is because immigration works like that, of course: the richer (and not ""the smaller"") the country, the higher the immigrants/emigrants ratio  - ignoring policies and stuff obviously.

Consider how nobody lifted a finger as Germany annexed Austria. Consider how the British just said ""okay"" as Hitler said ""hey, we want the Czechoslovakia now, too"". Only as Germany *then* invaded Poland, a country that had been promised independence by Britain and France, and in ignorance of British requests for negotiation, was war actually declared. Which was precisely how Hitler wanted it and what he was working towards as part of his PR plan.

Like, in your opinion, how much of Europe should the Nazis have gobbled up until the other countries stopped rolling over?

That being said, in my opinion war on Germany would have already been justified by how the Nazis treated their own citizens anyways.

It's absolutely correct that the origins of WW2 lie in WW1, predominantly the influence of certain American bankiers like Morgan, who pressured the US government into demanding harsher reparations.

648,"You're talking about the direct application of treaties within US domestic law. The primary purpose of a treaty is to act as a promise to other countries. Those promises hold regardless of any domestic legal issues (unless the treaty specifically says otherwise). Other countries don't give a fuck if some American court claims that something is ""unconstitutional"", they just care about whether the US government upholds its obligations or not.

In many other countries, treaties do not have any automatic domestic legal effect at all, and the government will often have to pass separate legislation to bring them into domestic law. But those governments are still bound by international treaties, exactly as much as America is.

The slightly unusual thing about the EU treaties is that they actually include a powerful enforcement mechanism: the ECJ gets to interpret EU law, and can impose unlimited fines on countries that fail to implement it correctly. The only way to get out of that (other than agreeing to amend the treaties) is by leaving the EU altogether, which as we are all currently seeing is a complicated and risky process.",,/r/europe/comments/7poggi/gay_spouses_have_rights_in_all_eu_countries_says/dsmkzpx/,bteyri,1515866061

It also makes no mention of ""harking on"", which is also semantically incorrect, the phrase is either: ""harking back"", or ""harping on"".

- Harping: to talk persistently, or repeatedly

It also seems unfair to infer from the Chancellor's statement without knowing what the question that prompted it was. Quotes can easily be removed from context.

- EG. If the reporters question was: ""What would you say to those who say the Referendum results can be reversed?""

In the end it's all a shit show and what Trump says and does is only meant to profit him in one or the other way whether through nepotism, dividing the nation or stirring up his base.

If you ignore the hypocrisy of some Americans regarding their view on immigration and their own history with natives, you'll still have to acknowledge that the US had benefitted from a huge influx of all sorts of immigrants in the past, many of whom came from poor and uneducated regions (Ireland, Italy, Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa etc.). On top of that the US is still a major destination for highly skilled people who cause a major brain drain for their 'shithole country' and thus inhibit the development of that country. This is further aggravated through the past US economic and military foreign policy in Central and Latin America and Africa (military interventions, supporting dictators, coups against democratically elected leaders, Chicago Boys, subsidies for US farming industry).

So, in terms of social and political indicators these countries may be shitholes but they didn't become that way due to the inferior society and people or whatever.

675,"I is not my intention to criticize your or anyones decision to stay in the US. If you look at the migration statistics, the number of people migrating both ways are very low. 

Like you most Norwegians love their country. We enjoy a decent standard of living here, our families are here and we know the culture here. This means that there are very little incentive for us to emigrate nowadays. (Most people emigrate only when the gain is sufficently greater than the loss, as was the case here in the last part of the 19th century; failing crops and population growth led to mass immigration of Norwegians to the US. At the time the situation here were comparable to that of Trump's ""shithole"" countries.)

What I meant to say is that there's been a shift in the economic balance. Our economy has developed and standard of living increased, while many Americans experience being poorer than the prior generation, and at this point where there can be opportunities to move both ways, but not significantly so. The Americans I've met here came because of career opportunities or family immigration. This is mostly the case for the Norwegians moving to the US as well. 

About your comment about living in a ""socialist"" country. Yes, our politics lean further to the left than American politics. However, political inclinations alone is rarely a reason to leave your home country (unless you face persecution). Many people here want a more ""capitalist"" political landscape, more similar to the US, but that alone won't cause a mass migration to the US. Conversely, many Americans loathe Trump and everything he stands for. That doesn't mean they are going to just pack up their things and leave.

Even the crappy stuff for drunks isn't bad, because the market has been developed over hundreds (or thousands) of years. Beer guys over here are constantly sharing info, and the good breweries become known through word of mouth. A guy that drinks beer every day from one brewery might never even step into a brewery down the street simply because someone he trusts said it's no good. And there are plenty of bad ones, so that's plausible. There are tons of business men with no knowledge of beer trying to cash in on the beer ""revolution"" and they are the ones ruining the name.

What is more troubling is that it doesnt matter if you re qualified or not you will get minimum wage and stay at the same job longer than 2 years if you re maximum lucky.

801,"&gt;Not all legislation is equal. The paper where this comes from concludes that Norway is about 3/4 integrated into the EU (obviously, there's plenty of room for dispute there).

&gt;You're correct that I should have written ""EU law"" instead of ""EU laws"", which would intimate that this was meant to be in terms of individual legislative acts.

You are correct in that not all laws are equal, but that also goes both ways. Some of the laws we implement are things that we would have (largely) implemented had we negotiated an free trade agreement too or simply due to our geographical position and low population. It would not be feasible to have completely separate product standards from the EU as an example.

I do agree that we do implement significant amount of laws though. What I do react on however is the usage of ""most"" which is so common and simply not accurate. 


&gt; The EU average (based on the EU's current extent) was pretty low back then, because much of the EU was under communist mismanagement, so the EU average isn't particularly meaningful. The affluent European countries had comparable GDP per capita back then (you can reduce the scope of the x-axis to zoom in further). Nobody every said that Norway was poor, just not as much richer as it's now.

When you are saying that Norway got rich due to oil then you are also saying that was relatively poor before, no? If you are arguing that we only richer then I agree through oil then I would agree, but I would say that we also were sufficiently richer than the other countries at the time for it to have been an issue in some minds. Just take a look at the UK now where many felt resentment for having to ""pay for poorer member states"" despite not being that much richer than the EU average.

&gt; Labour productivity only partially reflects the productivity of labour in terms of the personal capacities of workers or the intensity of their effort. The ratio between the output measure and the labour input depends to a large degree on the presence and/or use of other inputs (e.g. capital, intermediate inputs, technical, organisational and efficiency change, economies of scale).

Productivity in the sense I meant includes capital and all other factors and it is precisely because of these factors the average German worker produces more than the average Lithuanian worker. Very few people believe it is due to eastern Europeans putting in less effort.

First of all I'd like to point out that Finland didn't win the Continuation War. We lost and had to hand over some land, pay war reparations and put our President in prison. 



And I'm not sure if Finland could have avoided entering the war in 1941. Would the Soviet have left Finland alone had Finland not allied with Germany? Perhaps. But it's also possible that the Soviets would have tried to conquer Finland like they conquered the Baltics, and Finland would have fallen without German support. 


Of course the Continuation war was a terrible shitshow, and great mistakes were made and crimes committed. But I think it's a bit harsh to say that the war itself was a mistake, because there's no way of knowing what would have happened had Finland not entered the war when it did.

889,"From 1990 there was an increase compared to before due to the fact that our industry was mostly taken over by corrupt individuals and sold to scrap. Our agriculture also faltered due to the theft of irrigation systems, leaving some of the land unusable for irrigation, thus, weeds and trees began growing on it.

Also, an article sheds some light on why Romania seems to be ""greener"" than [before](https://www.vice.com/da/article/vd84a4/romania-deforestation):

&gt;The surface of a forest is calculated by the terrain it's on, so even a forest in which all the trees have been cut to their stumps is considered ""forested"". Sometimes the surface is theoretically grown by also calling the terrain occupied with shrubbery and grasslands for feeding animals, a forest. Which is why the National Statistics Institute says Romania has more forests than ten years ago.

So, overall, a giant lie made-up due to corruption.

If we go by forested area with actual living trees, this shows how we keep losing more forest than we gain:

http://www.globalforestwatch.org/country/ROU

That can be seen even in the GIF of this OP, where the forested area seems to concentrate around the Carpathians but disappear from around them for most part from 1960's onward.

This is complete bullshit and an opinion that only a person not from Bavaria can hold. Mainly fueled by the strange whish that the people are of Bavaria are way lefter than their voting makes them appear.  
The CSU moved way to the left and lost voters to the AfD, the FDP and the FW, to the more laissez faire and right wing spectrum. In the polls the left parties (SPD+Greens) have 25% here. 28% if you count in the Linke, which wont enter the parliament ever.

1174,"&gt;
Donald Trump has consistently called on America’s fellow members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to shoulder more of the alliance’s defense burden. He often portrays other countries as freeloaders enjoying America’s costly protection. This description of the alliance is incomplete, damaging and counterproductive—especially since there are significant areas where the Trump administration could push for change.
&gt;
Well before Mr. Trump entered the Oval Office, every NATO country committed to spend 2% of its gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Most of America’s allies have increased spending, but the president is right that they should spend more. The gap between underfunded NATO allies’ budgets today and the agreed target is about $116 billion a year, according to NATO data. But military spending alone will not solve NATO’s problems.
&gt;
The alliance’s most pressing challenge is to spend new resources wisely—in ways that generally improve trans-Atlantic security and specifically make NATO’s deterrence of Russia more effective. The Trump administration is overlooking other substantial contributions Europe could make.
&gt;
Start with rapid military mobilization and deployment. Since 2013, NATO has watched Russia conduct multiple large military exercises in and around Europe. These training missions demonstrate Moscow’s ability to move its forces rapidly to the frontier with NATO and the European Union. At the same time, Russia has employed disruptive tactics below the threshold that would provoke a NATO military response.
&gt;
To counter Russia’s attempts at coercion in Europe, NATO allies agreed in 2014 to position “tripwire” forces in the Baltic states and Poland. The alliance has also deployed multinational forces in the Black Sea region. But those forces are relatively small. They are meaningful only if, during a crisis, NATO is able to reinforce them promptly with larger forces. That is a crucial weakness in NATO’s strategy: Since the end of the Cold War, the alliance has failed to ensure that large-scale reinforcement can happen quickly and efficiently.
&gt;
Studies by the Center for Strategic and International Studies and others have highlighted Europe’s readiness problems. Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, who commanded U.S. Army forces in Europe until his retirement last year, frequently stressed the need to expedite border crossing arrangements. Since 2015, Gen. Hodges had called for a “military Schengen zone” akin to the agreement that allows unchecked movement of people and goods across most of the EU’s internal borders.
&gt;
The U.S. needs a two-pronged strategy to address these shortcomings and make deterrence in Europe credible and effective. The first element is to address regulatory impediments and expedite national approvals so that NATO military forces and equipment can move across European borders rapidly.
&gt;
But border-crossing bureaucracy is not the biggest obstacle. The more crucial shortcoming is Europe’s logistical capacity to move heavy military equipment and troops at scale. This requires adequate rail connections, rolling stock, ports, reinforced bridges and other infrastructure meeting the technical requirements for military transport. It makes little sense to spend billions on tanks without the means to get them to a flashpoint in time. Military commanders and defense ministers are unable to fix this problem. Improving infrastructure is the responsibility of national transportation authorities, the EU and private companies across NATO nations.
&gt;
As NATO approaches a summit meeting in July, Washington should engage with Europe to rebuild the Continent’s logistics infrastructure. This means addressing the EU effectively and seriously as a partner on political and security initiatives, something the Trump administration has seemed unwilling to do. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, after December meetings in Brussels with his EU and NATO colleagues, had little to say publicly about this crucial civilian burden-sharing.
&gt;
Currently, the EU’s central budget devotes some $19 billion a year on key transport corridors across Europe. Meanwhile the national governments of EU member states invest more than $120 billion annually, according to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data. Washington should work with the EU to ensure that infrastructure meeting NATO requirements is prioritized in the EU’s military-mobility review, which is due in March. In exchange, the U.S. should explore a formula under which European countries can count toward their 2% spending target a portion of dual-use infrastructure spending, which enhances military deterrence while also supporting economic growth.
&gt;
The U.S. should elevate this to an initiative that President Trump and his counterparts in Brussels can endorse in July. This would greatly improve NATO and EU cooperation, a longtime trans-Atlantic goal.
&gt;
Mr. Trump has made clear he wants America’s allies to shoulder more of the defense burden, and he has won that argument. Now he should find meaningful ways for these allies to meet their commitments. By focusing on mobilization and rapid deployment, and not only on spending numbers, NATO would strengthen its collective defense.

Are we capable of standing on our own two feet without assistance? Do we walk with pride and our head held high, confident in our government's mission and aptitude? 

The EU and its feeble attempts at becoming a superpower using soft power and humanitarianism are a fucking joke. We are so weak and indecisive that almost a million people poured through our borders for a whole year and while we squabbled like children and deflected the blame between ourselves our cities blew up like dinamite. All we could manage was ""part and parcel""; deal with it citizens, terrorism is not the government's problem. 

God forbid our politicians ever show a modicum of ruthlessness, strength and dignity. All show and no substance, that is how I would describe the EU. A decadent, moribund canvas of weak men and even weaker women. Or is it the other way around? I think it is.

1333,"1. I'm from the west and I don't really like East Germans. They behave a bit weird and I can't really make sense of them. But in general the relation between east and west seems to get better. 
When it comes to cultural differences I don't really know how to explain it properly. They are small and and I believe they are barely if at all noticeable if you're not German. The cultural differences between north and south Germany are much more pronounced than those between east and west. Societal there are two major differences between east and west Germany. The Population in the east is much older, young people tend to leave and go to west Germany or Berlin. And there are a lot less migrants and descendants of migrants in the east. The Gastarbeiter from southern Europe and Turkey came to West Germany in the 50s and 60s and stayed there.

2. We are not that bad at English speaking as a country. I notice my accent when speaking English. I don't notice anything else when speaking English, it's really strong. But I stopped caring about it. People will notice where I'm from anyway. I can't remenber hearing English before I started learning it. English seems to be a much better language than German to make jokes, it has to do with the structure of sentences, it keeps the recipient in the dark much longer, that I like about English. What I don't like about English is the feeling that I can't be as precise as I want to be. But that might be because I'm not good enough at speaking the language.

3. Can't answer

4. I have no idea what all that fuzz about german engineering is about. I'd guess it's so highly thought of because we're one of the few western nations with accordingly proper quality standards that actually manufacture goods.

5. Depends on yur point of view.

6. stand-up, sitcoms, panel shows - we've got it all. Is it funny? Not really, I'm not a fan of the german humour industry. But we accept it because we tend to laugh at what is called humour. I don't think there is a such a thing as German humour.

7. I can only speak for north Germans, the southeners are a different breed. I know Bavarians who lived here for some time and were extremly unhappy. We are cold, emotionally distant, unfeeling and standoffish (that's a beautiful word, thank you for that). But we will almost always try to be polite, fair and somewhat humble. When you want warmth you'll need us drunk or become aclose friend of us or become part of our family, that might be easier that becoming our friend.

8. We dont get on with the Turks or with the Turkish state? Racism and xenophobia obviously exist. To what extend I cannot say. You'd have to ask someone affected. I can say that it differs regionally you will encounter it more often and more openly in he east and in more rural areas.

9. Of course they have rights. They can do what everyone else is allowed to do. Marriage, adoption, sex between to men, it's all legal. Culturally and socially beeing LGBT is mostly acceted, i'd say.

10. I don't now much about UK in that regard, but based on your question and suspected similarities to the US i would say that we are much more open. And don't forget that we are the nation known for porn that's more on the disgusting side of weird. That's not a stereotype.

11. Rugby and especially Cricket aren't at all popular in Germany. Snooker and Darts are shown on some smaller TV channels. There is football and then there is a lot of nothing. One the second place is probably handball, we invented that as a sport for girls, now it's played by large and heavy men. Then there is basketball, ice hockey, tennis, but that died of a bit, and of course there is biathlon, we love that stuff.

1362,"&gt;... but the children of migrants will change our/others laws bit by bit and what is frightening is the few mostly left/liberal types who seem to think that we can all in a Utopia.

&gt;Irish people did integrate into their new countries.

The Irish did integrate, but that wasn't the point of contention. It was your earlier concern that the children of migrants would change laws bit by bit. Yet that is exactly what the Irish did! The were regarded as less than people when first immigrating but soon became backbones of their new homes. History is echoing and yet you seem to be deaf to it. The history books will not look kindly on you in the same way they have not looked kindly on those who regarded the Irish as less than people. 

&gt; We have people chancing their arm crossing seas risking their lives because some people say everyone is welcome here and all they're doing is encouraging more deaths by doing so. 

Perhaps we should be helping them in their home lands then. I suspect you would object to that too though. So let's not pretend like your concern is for the migrants. 

&gt;That handout was to banks and was a loan and a burden on the Irish people which puts us in debt. It wasn't a ""nice"" gesture.

It saved the Irish economy from ruin. If you can't see the connection between that and a benefit to the Irish people then perhaps your understanding of economics is as bad as your understanding of history.

Take only people from camps, preferably religious/ethnic minorities, those most at risk. Make it clear that if you use irregular means of entry, you have ZERO chance of staying. The flip side is these smuggler gangs need to be hit, and hit hard.

1367,"Den Haag ('the hedge') is older than 's-Gravenhage (des graven hage; 'hedge of the count') though, eventhough the latter sounds fancier.   

The name is easily explained by the fact that the Count of Holland built a castle here. It was 'in the middle of nowhere'; at least not in a city, which came with its politics and defense issues. It had a garden and a moat around it. Later it expanded with buildings and developed to what we still call the [Binnenhof](http://medias.photodeck.com/f1a62f23-c756-4047-aa2d-945ac7974c36/300167_xgaplus.jpg) (inner court), the current collection of government buildings.    

The city grew around the Binnenhof. That also explains why the city is so different from other Dutch cities. They didn't have a city wall, as it grew from a settlement next to the castle into a [large village](http://www.denhaagzoalshetwas.nl/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/s-Gravenhage-ten-tijde-van-Philips-II-anno-1560-1570-door-A.-ter-Meer-Derval-1932.jpg).

&gt;Yedinstvo (literally: Unity, Russian: Единство, Lithuanian: Vienybė, Polish: Jedność)[1] was a pro-Moscow and anti-Sąjūdis movement in the Lithuanian SSR during the Perestroika era. The goals of the movement were similar to those of the Latvian and Estonian Internationalist Movements,[2] e.g. opposition to disintegration of the Soviet Union. Yedinstvo was supported by the Soviet military and the KGB.

&gt;In addition to ethic Russians, the organization had some success among the Polish minority in Lithuania, many[specify] of whom preferred Lithuania as a member of the Soviet Union. Yedinstvo went as far as to support forming a Polish autonomous region in southeastern Lithuania.[1] Some commentators suggested that the organization was more popular with the Polish minority than the Russophone minority of Lithuania,[3] which might have surprised the Poles of Warsaw, then seeking a de-communization in Poland. At the election to the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies, two Poles were elected to that body, both pro-Moscow.

1394,"You see that is what Im talking about in my first post. Left voters look at the definition as ""you cant go there at all"". Right voters are looking at it as ""a problematic criminal area which you should avoid"". You simply proved the point right now.

But it doesnt matter. The fact is you dont have to agree with if it's a good definition or not. I couldnt care less. It is still the legit definition that politicians and police are going for when they discuss it. This is what they mean when they use the term ""no-go zone"" and that's a fact. In other words, ""An area that has a reputation for violence and crime"". A problematic area that the government has problems controlling according to the government. They define it. Not you or me, so no it's doesnt ""depend on whom you ask"". You dont have to agree with the definition, but this is what they mean when they talk about it. It's useful, and you know why of course? Because we discuss it right here, right now. ""Who lives in these ""no-go zones?"" "" is a question.....go figure.

Edit:
You are arguing about stuff that i dont control. You gotta bring this up with the politicians if you dont like the definition. For me it's a non-issue, let them call it a ""no-go zone"". Again, you dont have to agree, but this is the fact, this is what they mean by a ""no go zone"" since that is the definition of it.

I'm not an expert but I at least know the basic shit, like that the EU punishing the UK over Brexit is some shitty divorce analogy that only imbeciles believe. The EU will do whatever is in its best interests, harming a neighbor and giving itself a shitty image as an entity that tries to punish countries that leave it is NOT in its best interests believe it or not.


&gt; Also, didn't UK themselves want to lock down the borders tightly themselves to begin with?


Visa-free travel isn't the same as immigration. Nobody wants to stop tourism. If you don't even know the difference between visa-free travel and immigration then for fucks sake stop spreading ignorance. You're getting upvoted by retards that believe the EU stopping visa-free travel for the UK as some sort of punishment is actually a possibility.


The EU wants the best deal possible for itself, it's not gonna shoot itself in the foot for literally no good reason. We have visa-free travel with pretty much all of North and South America, Australia, South Korea, Japan and a ton of other countries.

It is indeed a part of the religion, as it is a part of the holy texts of the religion. But the bad parts are there as a historical testimony of the sort of society in which the New Covenant arose.

1478,"Hitler's private life is not irrelevant since the Nazi party was extremely elitist. It's rather the opposite, that whatever the bulk of the party members privately thought is of little concern since it was the top members that formulated the ideals and goals of the movement. You must understand that Nazism had two faces, one which was partly false that they displayed to the public, full of populism and deceptive commitments, aided and abeted by a large propaganda machine. The other we find in their books, treatises and occasionaly recorded (by hand, stenography) conversations. It is in these that the Nazi ideology is put forward and from whence our knowledge on their thoughts on religion comes from. It is in these they style themselves as atheist not in their public orations. If you fail to realize this double nature of Nazism you will never be able to make head or tail of their totalitarian and the-end-justifies-the-means philosophy.

Edit: your analogy of Hitler's religious beliefs or lack thereof and his love of dogs is a very poor one, because it doesn't take much contemplation to realize they are not comparable.

Being honest about your faults is always a reputation loss.  You see a similar thing in EU vs. US comparisons: US has much more stringent transparency laws on lobbying, so it's easier for journalists to drum up a story about lobbying, so Europeans develop impression that lobbying is less potent in the EU because it's not reported upon in the same way, because the data is more hidden.

1527,"The pro-independence parties were able to form a government though right? I guess we won't really know what the majority of Catalonians think unless there is an independence referendum.

They broke their own laws? That certainly isn't helpful. Well I guess it's kind of ""reasonable"" for people to protest since the Spanish government shut down the referendum. That may not have been a very wise move I think (but then again what do I know?)

There is a United Nations one if I'm not mistaken but it probably isn't binding. Yeah but surely when it comes to Catalonia, Catalonians should be the ones that decide the state of their ""country"" ( for lack of a better word). Having people from Madrid or any other place outside of Catalonia decide about Catalonia doesn't seem very democratic. If that process was followed every time a nation wanted to become independent, we would still have huge empires and lots of countries wouldn't exist.
Right but they are very autonomous and a lot of them don't feel that they are Spanish.

I'm not sure I understand what you're saying in that last paragraph. Is Tabarnia a thing?

The way I see it it's better to hold a referendum and having to deal with the result no matter what that is, instead of shutting people down. Because that could lead to more anger in the ""oppressed"" side which could lead to terrorist attacks, guerilla wars etc. And even if that doesn't happen, you still end up with a large portion of people being displeased and feeling angry. 
Europe has fought way too many wars with itself, maybe it's time for a more peaceful way to sort out issues like this one.
 
I'm not suggesting that Spain should immediately grant independence to everyone. But they have to find a more efficient way to deal with the independence movements.

I was on a so called Europe school, so every year like 300 pupils from all around Europe came to our school and our English was the best compared to the others English I am 100% sure with that. The other pupils were high school pupils from Poland, Italy, Spain etc.
And we are aware of our godawful accent. There is a German politician (Günther Oettinger) and people are making fun of him all the time. He is known for His English: .https://youtu.be/-RrEQ8Ovw-Q
He is called Mr. Denglischttps sometimes (Deutsch and Englisch = Denglisch). 
And we dont like the impressions mostly us-americans do make about us.


That ist what i observed and my opinion. feel free to correct me. ;)

1566,"I think we're both talking past each other at this point. You feel I'm misinterpreting your arguments, I feel you're misinterpreting mine. 

My core argument is very simple: whilst there is plenty of legitimate criticism to be leveled against the Obama administration regarding military action in the Middle East, the overwhelming amount of people who are not generally on 'the left' who engage in that type of criticism are a bunch of hypocrites who would've verbally burned down whatever he did, whatever choice he made, whilst celebrating whatever choice 'their guy' made.

In this situation, the average recent ""Obama was a warmonger, drone strikes, rah rah rah"" criticism tends to come from a very dishonest place, as it's used by people who celebrate similar interventions if it's done by 'their guy'. 

That's what I'm trying to highlight here. The Obama admin's decisions regarding military actions in the Middle East have obviously not been perfect and there is plenty of serious criticism to be thrown at it. It just so happens to be that a very large part of the people chucking that exact criticism around are dishonest actors. 

I think for a serious criticism of Obama's military interventions, one needs to make sure their bedpartners aren't a bunch of liars and hypocrites, because then the line between legitimate criticism and hyper-partisan screaming blurs to the point where it disappears. 

There are two main categories of ""Obama was a warmonger reee"" people. The hyper-left who suffer an aneurysm whenever an F-16 takes off anywhere on one hand and the Trump camp, for who nothing matters anymore, on the other hand.

Whilst the hyper-left ""murica warcriminals reee"" camp can be utterly insufferable, at least they're consistent. They detest any form of American military action.

The Trump camp, however, is significantly more insincere. This needs to further explaining or evidence, I think. Now I'm not saying you belong to that camp, but I am saying that if you intend to deliver legitimate, non-partisan criticism, you must take care to distinguish it from the typical ""Obama was a warmonger, MAGA"" crowd.

1598,"&gt;”In political science, the term banana republic describes a politically unstable country with an economy dependent upon the exportation of a limited-resource product, e.g. bananas, minerals, etc. In 1901, the American author O. Henry coined the term to describe Honduras and neighbouring countries under the extraordinary economic influence of American fruit corporations, such as the United Fruit Company. Typically, a banana republic has a society of stratified social classes, usually a great, poor working class and a ruling-class plutocracy, composed of the business, political and military elites of that society.[1] Such a ruling-class oligarchy control the primary sector of the economy by way of the exploitation of labour;[2] thus, the term banana republic is a pejorative descriptor for a servile dictatorship that abets and supports, for kickbacks, the exploitation of large-scale plantation agriculture, especially banana cultivation.[2]”

*Emphasis in original article.*

&gt; The start of the year 2018 will be politically tinted by the immigration law bill presented by the government. The shape of this bill is still blurry but everything points toward a hardening of France's migratory policies.

&gt; Several elements point toward that: higher expulsions goals, controls in housing centers—**which LREM MP of Val d'Oise  Aurélien Taché**, put in charge of a mission on reworking integration policies by the prime minister, **denies**—or even lacerating refugees tents after the dismantling of a camp, porte de la Chapelle in Paris last december 11.

&gt; Nothing worrying for Louis Aliot who, even though in the FN opposition,  brings indirect support to the government. Invited by BFMTV this tuesday 19th december, the FN vice-president assured:

&gt; &gt; « We should really denounce a number of associations who, them, **manipulate numbers, manipulate minds, and try to convince us through propaganda simply that the state, suddenly, becomes a police state and will persecute asylum seekers or refugees or migrants.** It's properly scandalous. »

&gt; Louis Aliot then approves the Interior Ministry initiative to send administrative teams make a census of the occupants of emergency housing centers. ""And why shouldn't we census them?"" assesses Louis Aliot. He adds:

&gt; &gt; « When you go to school, you're part of a census. France makes census of it's population. **Why shouldn't we make census of these housing centers?** Because there are politicized associations within, who live from French taxpayer money, and **who have politics that go against the national interest.** »

&gt; We therefor understand that from an immigration standpoint, Louis Aliot seems rather close to the governmental line. ""What is interesting in this bill is that it brings up the problems of immigration, of the migratory flows and how we respond to it.""

&gt; In a press release sent monday, the FN ""praises that the major problem that is immigration is brought up"". ""**[The party] sees there a political victory.** [The party] will participate in this essential debate with the intent to bring to light the disaster for everybody that are these massive population transfers"", the party adds.

&gt; A nice support that could not be superfluous. Indeed, on the side of the parliamentary majority, everybody isn't on the same wavelength and some LREM MPs already seem opposed to a hardening of the legislation. ""The shortcomings of refugees integration is the real scandal… **Our integration policies isn't at the level that of a great nation**"", denounced for example the Paris MP Stanislas Guerini, december 11th in the journal L'Opinion.

**TL;DR: A vice president of the FN defended the government's suggested immigration policy on TV, and in a press release the party said the suggested immigration policy was a political victory for the FN.**",France,/r/europe/comments/7punym/emmanuel_macron_is_tightening_immigration_rules/dslb6vf/,BreakTheLoop,1515793524

Without this immigration, natives would instead remain doing these low-skilled low-paid jobs.

Not for any documents you use internally, but because they're in such wide use by external firms that you *have* to interact with. And that means bug compatibility, too. LibreOffice is an impressive effort, but still has plenty of interoperability issues. And certain software does not have satisfactory open source equivalents or even runs on Linux, such as Adobe's offerings.

1763,"&gt;The numbers you you use there prove nothing, as there are obviously other factors in play.

I disagree, clearly there are far more important factors. Bosnia and Russia are among the countries with the road accident death rate while they require DRLs. The UK is only behind Sweden in non micro-state European countries and has considerably more vehicles per km of road. Monaco has the lowest accident death rate and does not require them.

You can find studies that claim the opposite too
https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/811029
&gt;The analysis found that DRLs have no statistically significant overall effects on the three target crashes. When combining these three target crashes into one target crash, the DRL effects were also not statistically significant. When examined separately for passenger cars and light trucks/vans \(LTVs\), DRLs in LTVs significantly reduced LTVs’ involvements in the target two-vehicle crashes by 5.7 percent. However, the remaining DRL effects on these three target crashes were not statistically significant. Although not statistically significant, DRLs might have unintended consequences for pedestrians and motorcyclists. Particularly, the estimated negative effects for LTVs were relatively large and cannot be completely ignored.

I read another study claiming that they had a greater effect on accident rates in Scandinavia and generally darker countries than the US, this would indicate that the reduction does not really come in daylight but perhaps transition/early darkness.

So even if we believe that 15% figure in the study you linked that would be a reduction in the UK of 274 deaths.

1765,"&gt;Only party with PP that wants bullfighting back in Catalunya.

That shows that on the issue of bullfighting they are _as far_ right as PP, not _further_.

&gt;Stronger than PP with 155.

PP needed PSOE's support for 155 and needed to uphold an image of ""statemanship"" in the eyes of international opinion. You can be certain that if PSOE was in government it would be PP who would be the most radical regarding article 155. 

In fact, compare PPC's campaign with that of Ciudadanos within Catalonia. García Albiol was _much_ more radical than Arrimadas.

&gt;Ultra liberal economy, which we usually associate with right wing parties (USA republican, british tories).

But not with **far right** parties, which is what you claimed. In fact, the actual far right makes a point of rejecting liberal economics: the French FN is a clear example.

&gt;Extreme centralism, which again is associated with right wing parties (UK Tories).

That is very debatable. I notice you didn't include the US Republican party in your examples, maybe because you're aware that they tend to defend states' rights in opposition to the central government. Also, historical far-right reactionary movements such as [Carlism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlism) made decentralisation and the defence of local [fueros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuero) key tenets of their ideology.

1778,"&gt;Introduction of substantial financial transaction tax.

Well, there goes the DAX. 

[Sweden experimented with the past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_financial_transaction_tax). It's a truly awful idea, set in a 'tax the rich' mindset, but ultimately ends up hurting everyone. 

EDIT: [More from The Economist](https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21641258-new-life-bad-idea-still-kicking)

&gt;EUROPE has a chequered history when it comes to taxing financial transactions. Britain has a centuries-old stamp duty on share purchases but wants to protect the City from further fiscal burdens. Sweden tried a tax in the 1980s and dropped it when share-trading emigrated. France and Italy have recently imposed different sorts of financial-transaction taxes (FTTs). But at the year’s first meeting of European finance ministers, France, along with ten other like-minded members of the European Union, dusted off a moribund plan to introduce a harmonised FTT.

&gt;Countries like Britain and Luxembourg, which lives off its asset-management industry, have long thwarted attempts to introduce an EU-wide FTT. In response, in 2014, a coalition of more enthusiastic EU members announced its intention to start taxing something financial in 2016. Since then the 11—Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain—have squabbled over what and how.

&gt;Should a wide range of financial instruments including derivatives be taxed, as Austria and Germany favoured? France, though as keen as the next country to humble the moneymen, wanted to exclude most derivatives: its banks have at least a quarter of the European market in equity-based ones. Should the location of the company issuing the security determine whether a transaction was taxable and what country got the money, or that of the buyers and sellers? Smaller countries with few big financial firms feared losing out if issuance rather than residence was the test. When negotiations broke down at the end of December, it seemed that all was over.

&gt;It was France’s abrupt change of position that brought the FTT back to life. On January 5th President François Hollande said his country would back the broadest possible FTT, at a low rate. With help from Austria, the French then rallied support. On January 27th the coalition announced that they had agreed to work towards a tax along Franco-Austrian lines. They asked the European Commission to play a bigger role in the preparations (France’s former economy minister, Pierre Moscovici, is now the commissioner in charge of the matter in Brussels). Austria’s finance minister, Hans Jörg Schelling, was asked to steer the project. Implausibly, they still plan to put something in place in 2016.

&gt;The experience of France and Italy will be instructive. In 2012 France imposed a financial-transaction tax of 0.2% on purchases of the shares or comparable securities issued by firms headquartered in France with a market capitalisation of €1 billion ($1.1 billion) or more. Italy was more radical. Since March 2013 it has taxed transactions in shares of companies headquartered in Italy and capitalised at more than €500m, initially at 0.12%. The initial rate on over-the-counter transactions (meaning those negotiated directly between buyer and seller, rather than via an exchange of some sort) was significantly higher, at 0.22%. Since September 2013 derivatives have also been taxed. Although the precise formula is complicated, the tax rises to €200 on transactions with a nominal value of more than €1m.

&gt;New calculations by Credit Suisse, a bank, show that in France, after an initial wobble, trading volumes have not been much affected. The average daily value of shares traded since the tax was imposed has been almost 12% lower than in 2011, the last full year before it kicked in. But in the rest of Europe trading has fallen by almost 10%. There is little indication that companies are unable to finance themselves or that much business has moved offshore.


&gt;In Italy, by contrast, there has been a sharp fall in volume. Average trading on all Italian markets since the taxes were put in place was almost 12% lower than in 2012, whereas trading elsewhere in Europe increased by almost 7%. One goal was to divert murky trading to more transparent markets, and this aim was achieved (see chart). The cost of increasing transparency, however, appears to have been an overall withdrawal of funds from the Italian market, says Mark Buchanan of Credit Suisse.

&gt;In theory, the coalition is now aiming to produce a tax that more closely resembles Italy’s than France’s. Internal rows may scupper the plan again. But financial folk who once felt confident that the tax would never see the light of day are now less sure. “I don’t say that the tax is probable,” says a worried French banker, “but with this level of political support at the highest level, it is now looking possible.”

The way the topography is it is suicidal to give a km to a state that is orders of magnitude larger, petro-funded, militant, dictatorial and deeply sickly anti-Armenian.  Artsakh was originally just NKAO, but certain lovely people were shelling Stepanakert.  Now they want those firing positions back?

Azerbaijan took some Armenian villages at the edge of Artsakh, started the fireworks with pogroms of all Armenians out of Baku and Sumgayit and Operation Ring in Ganca, and it also has Nakhichevan.

Azerbaijan also gets military support from Turkey which is occupying Western Armenia and Northern Cyprus.  Both actively deny the Armenian Genocide and have a deep tradition of using attacks on Armenians to consolidate power.

Artsakh is deep in the mountains, it was the last bastion of Armenian semi-autonomy after the Turkic invasions.  In the course of Islamisation and Turkification of the region Armenians have been reduced and reduced, now have their backs against the wall.  Kemal's Turkey was so classy it even attacked independent Armenia right after the Genocide and took Kars , Ani and Ararat.  At this point we all understand a ""Turkish promise"".  Those governments will do it again, deny, then say ""tragedy for everybody"", purposefully delay then say ""but it was a long time ago"".

Well it became a term a while ago. The police dont want normal citizens to go there while being unaware of what can happen. So it's a way of scaring the public (which they should be doing btw for their own good). Calling it a ""no-go zone"" actually helps, it creates a discussion such as the one we are having right now. Like, ""how do we solve this?"", ""what is this?"", ""who lives out there?"", ""what are the demographics like?"" etc etc.

This ambassador was simply just dumb because he couldnt define it ontop of his head... so he rather take the hit in the discussion because he was under pressure. It's stupid as a politician to use that term if you dont know what it means, yes, but it still does exist such areas over there.

I don't think it was ever about crimes, so I doubt that. 

&gt;BiH has it’s own army. Serbia has an army which it can use if Bosnian Serbs are ever in real danger. So why do civilians have to have even more weapons.

Everybody and their mother is armed in Bosnia. There are tons and tons of weapons that were never returned, and are sitting somewhere.

2) they then claimed that their inaction had an humanitarian motive. 

This framed the whole debate completely the wrong way : instead to take in refugee in an orderly manner in Europe, which can be defended, she tried to lay the whole burden on the southern countries that were already hit by the competitive shock HARD. 

Then she wanted Eastern Europe countries to ""share the burden"", but that are in the middle of a demographic crisis themselves, with a lot of their young peoples going west.  That didn't send the right message AT ALL. Add the culture shock that is currently going on...

Yes, I guess if we'd live in an alternate universe in which the SPD *had* a more leftward focus you'd have a point.

That was true half a century ago, not so much today and hasn't really been since the late 90s at least.

&gt;Not a conspiracy theory but official party reasoning as to not get rid of Gedeon:

Did you forget that Thilo Sarrazin is still a member of the SPD, a man who was also publicly decried for being racist, Nazi, literally Hitler for voicing his opinion on dysgenic immigration, the problems with Turks and other Muslim migrants, replacement migration that'll lead to Germans becoming minorities in their own country etc.?

If you criticize the AfD for that, you should at least have to be consistent and hold the SPD to the same standards.

Btw I share both Sarrazin's and Gedeon's sentiments to a large degree and I think neither are anti-semitic, nor am I, nor do they themselves seem to think so. But that's a bit off-topic I guess.

College professors, across race/ethnicity and gender, are more likely to respond to queries from students they believe are white males. Despite universities frequently being described as bastions of progressivism and liberal indoctrination centers, a recent study found that faculty of colleges and universities are more likely to ignore requests for mentorship from minority and/or female students. Researchers sent more than 6,500 professors at 259 schools in 89 disciplines identical letters that differed only in the name and implied race/gender of the fictitious student sender (e.g., “Mei Chen” as an Asian female; “Keisha Thomas” as a black female; “Brad Anderson” as a white male). The study found that regardless of discipline (with the sole exception of fine arts), faculty more consistently responded to perceived white males. Two notable additional findings: 1) professors at public institutions were significantly more likely than their private institution counterparts to respond to students of color, and 2) the students most discriminated against were perceived East Asian women, followed by South Asian men.

White people, including white children, are less moved by the pain of people of color, including children of color, than by the pain of fellow whites. Three distinct studies support this finding. The first found that around age 7, white children began to believe black children are less susceptible to pain than white children. Another study found that emergency room personnel are less likely to give African American and Latino/Hispanic children pain medication, even when they are experiencing severe abdominal pain. The same study also found that even when the same tests are ordered, black and Hispanic children face significantly longer emergency room stays. A third study found that white people feel less empathy toward black people in pain than they do for whites experiencing pain https://news.virginia.edu/content/study-racial-bias-pain-perception-appears-among-children-young-7

Black men are sentenced to far lengthier prison sentences than white men for the same crimes. A 2012 study by the United States Sentencing Commission found black men were sentenced to prison terms nearly 20 percent longer than white men for similar crimes. To break those numbers down further, from January 2005 to December 2007, sentences for black males were 15.2 percent longer than those of their white counterparts. From December 2007 to September 2011, that number actually increased, with differences in sentencing growing to 19.5 percent. https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324432004578304463789858002

Black children are more likely to be tried as adults and are given harsher sentences than white children. A Stanford University study uncovered this sobering information: ""[S]imply bringing to mind a black (vs. white) juvenile offender led [white study] participants to view juveniles in general as significantly more similar to adults in their inherent culpability and to express more support for severe sentencing.” That is, when white respondents thought the child on trial was black, they were more like to endorse “sentencing all juveniles to life without parole when they have committed serious violent crimes.” That might explain why, of the roughly 2,500 juveniles in the U.S. who have been sentenced to life without parole, nearly all (97 percent) were male and (60 percent) black. Interesting study note: for black kids, killing a white person was a good way to end up behind bars for their entire adult life. For white kids, killing a black person actually helped their chances of ensuring their prison stay would be temporary. From the report: “[T]he proportion of African American [juveniles sentenced to life without parole] for the killing of a white person (43.4 percent) is nearly twice the rate at which African American juveniles overall have taken a white person’s life (23.2 percent). What’s more, we find that the odds of a [juvenile life without probation] sentence for a white offender who killed a black victim are only about half as likely (3.6 percent) as the proportion of white juveniles arrested for killing blacks (6.4 percent).”

White people are more likely to support the criminal justice system, including the death penalty, when they think it’s disproportionately punitive toward black people. That’s right: white people agree with criminal justice outcomes more when they think race disproportionately targets black people for incarceration. According to a 2012 Stanford study conducted in ""liberal"" San Francisco and New York City, when white people were told that black people were unfairly impacted by punitive criminal justice policies like three-strikes laws and stop-and-frisk, they were less likely to advocate for criminal justice reform. In a similar vein, researchers found in 2007 that telling whites about racist sentencing laws made them favor harsher sentences. That is, racism made them like those sentences more. The study authors write: “[O]ur most startling finding is that many whites actually become more supportive of the death penalty upon learning that it discriminates against blacks.”

The more ""stereotypically black"" a defendant looks in a murder case, the higher the likelihood he will be sentenced to death. This is perhaps one of the most horrifying findings in a list of horrifying findings. To quote the study, “the degree to which the defendant is perceived to have a stereotypically black appearance (e.g., broad nose, thick lips, dark skin)” could mean the difference between a sentence of life or death, particularly if his victim was white. Read the whole study; it’s fascinating.

http://www.uky.edu/AS/PoliSci/Peffley/pdf/Eberhardt.2006.Psych%20Sci.Looking%20Deathworthy.pdf

Conversely, white people falsely recall black men they perceive as being “smart” as being lighter-skinned. Here's another incredible, though not entirely surprising study finding. When white people encounter the faces of African American men they are primed to believe are “educated,” they later recall those individuals as being lighter-skinned than they actually were. The researchers developed a name for this phenomenon: “skin tone memory bias.” This compulsion was chalked up to stereotypical beliefs about dark skin and its correlation with negative traits. To reckon with the cognitive dissonance created by perceiving a black man as “educated,” white participants unconsciously realigned that intelligence with skin that more closely approximated whiteness.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/14/skin-tone-bias_n_4597924.html

A number of studies find white people view lighter-skinned African Americans (and Latinos) as more intelligent, competent, trustworthy and reliable than their darker-skinned peers. A 2006 study found that dark-skinned black men with MBAs were less likely to be hired than lighter-skinned black men who only possessed bachelor’s degrees. A 2010 study in North Carolina found that light-skinned black women received shorter prison terms than darker-skinned black women. And a 2012 Villanova University study found that, “African American and Latino respondents with the lightest skin are several times more likely to be seen by whites as intelligent compared with those with the darkest skin.”

It's not necessarily always a big aspect. Many people, in Europe in particular, believe in god in a purely private manner. It's just their personal convinction that may help them emotionally in some ways, but they otherwise function completely the same as non-religious people. They have God as an emotional support that helps them in tough situation and they often don't even believe in the majority of what the Bible says, they just adjust the faith to the modern scientific knowledge, i.e. they believe that God was the source of the Big Bang that created our Universe.

2071,"&gt; It can still be proved that they don't though, it's just a little harder. As long as there is the concrete notion of giving gifts it can be proved that such a being does not exist since we can track every one

We can theoretically, but not practically, and that is enough wiggleroom (also see the last paragraph)

&gt; whereas god's existence is 100% unverifiable because the signs of his alleged existence are indistinguishable from natural occurrences.

This depends on the precise definition you're going by. Many believers claims to have spoken to God, for example, as well as acts of God that we might or might not be able to distinguish from natural events. 

If they are *truly* indistinguishable from natural occurrences, then there is no reason to assume they aren't natural occurrences. By that I mean that to be indistinguishable, there needs to be clear cause and effect that leads to these events following known laws of nature, and if so, ""God"" could not deviate from doing things that would happen anyway. If you have a deity and its net effect is nothing, and it can't be observed, the most rational assumption is that it doesn't exist - it won't matter if you're wrong anyway - you won't be able to tell.

The idea of a god only makes sense if it is an entity separate from and distinct from natural laws, in which case it is detectable. I mean, I could claim that gravity is caused by invisible pink unicorns that push us down, but if they're undetectable and the effect is indistinguishable from what would otherwise be expected, then it would be more rational to assume that claim is false.

&gt; To be on the same level, Santa would have to be an intangible being driving people into gifting their kids on Christmas :)

See, now you're thinking as a believer. And that's exactly why disproving Santa is just as meaningless an exercise - if anyone *cared*, the goal posts would just keep shifting.

That would mean we would live with government without mandate for 4 years.

The problems are that Babis leader of ANO is investigated for corruption. There is a vote in parliment for taking away his immunity he has in parliment. Due to this most of the parties wont form government with ANO unless Babis isnt given to police and isnt in the government.

Jokes aside I think is silly to believe he really meant to execute them by hanging and what he said should be considered as figurative speech, a hyperbole or figure of speech for ""the flags will be gone and they will too with them"" or something like that.

On another note the insolence of some of the magyar leadership begin to be too aanoying and they should be put in place.

I (and most of Romanians) surely don't put together with those all the Magyars here, many of them being really OK people that have no problems getting along just fine with the Romanian majority and sharing the same life and problems (some make mixed families as well, and I read some really stupid, insecure and pathetic demands from some maghyar leaders asking their youth to not make freinds, let alone marry romanians, because they might become romanians and blabla).

The main problem is the politicians trying to stir some sheet and get votes to maintain themselves in power (mostly Orban and his party in Hungayr, but those here too, both Romanians and Hungarian politicians).

Those two counties here with a majority of Hunagrian ethnics are actually among the poorest in Romania, despite they are lead and administrated at local level by ethnic hungarian politicians.

They also avoided to take EU funds for local projects and instead robbed blind the local resources (like forests for example) and in Parliament they vote with whoever is in power, to make those to close an eye to what they do in those places. They try to keep the hungarian ethnics there like in a spiritual and cultural ghetto, cut from outside world and brainwashed, almost as a sort of sheep flock that will always vote for them no matter what and will dream forever to some illusions they fed them with. Also if they get hungarians citizenship, to vote for Orban party for an even bigger illusion of being part of some future greater happy Hungary that have no realism in it (not just that like 80% of population in Transylvania is made up of Romanians anyway but history and EU had already moved in the direction of globalism and removal of enclaves and tribalism). 

Then small countries with no actual power like Hungary are more like pissing against the wind (hoping the stars will align for them maybe) and get wet all over due to that then ask themselves what happened and why are they wet.

2155,"Not believing in ""the tenets of the church or any other religion"" does not mean that you have to despise religious people. You can be unreligious and still respect religious people. Is that really that hard a concept for you to grasp? Do you really only see reality in black and white and think that you either believe in god or you don't and have to hate those who do?

You said that ""being religious doesn't mean you are infallible or that you are immune from criticism or prosecution"", does that mean that you think that it is right to prosecute people for their religious beliefs? 
Criticism of religion means having a philosophical discussion in which you discuss the reasons why you don't believe that a divine entity exists (or any other religious belief for that matter) or why you do, and the other person discusses the reasons why they may agree or disagree. At the end of such a discussion both ends should still be respectful of the other's opinion.

You say it is not strange to be openly against religion, by which I take it that you think it is right to be against religion (please correct me if I'm wrong). Not being religious and being against religion are two very different things.

2169,"You can't say anything precisely and quantifiable about it in a statistical sense, but you certainly say a lot about it. 

We could make the same argument about Santa Claus. 

We *do know* that many variations over beliefs in gods are logically impossible (e.g. full omnipotence is a logical impossibility as it is inherently paradoxical; more limited forms might be impossible to rule out), inconsistent with all known relevant data, or simply lack evidence. That is insufficient for us to conclusively and entirely rule out every variation, but it is sufficient for us to estimate the probability as exceedingly low.

That estimate may be wrong if some our data turns out to be wrong, but that does not prevent an estimate.

The same way as I can not precisely say anything about the probability of there being a teapot in orbit around the sun - it is *possible* to do, and it is *possible* that one of the powers with launch capabilities have launched a teapot into orbit, and it'd be in practical terms impossible to falsify. 

But that sure as hell does not stop me from saying that all available information indicates that the *probability* of there being a teapot in orbit is exceedingly low to the point that if someone asks if there is one I'd have said ""no"" if not for the fact that this *specific* object would immediately clue me up that someone is [referring to Russel's teapot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_teapot).
  
&gt; Edit: To continue a bit on that... believing that there isnt a god is just as much a belief as believing there is a god, 

But most people don't go around holding an active belief that there isn't a god, so that's a strawman. Most atheists go around simply finding the lack of evidence for a god to mean there is nothing to believe in. 

To put it another way, most of us don't go around holding a belief that they're not surrounded by invisible pink unicorns - the idea simply doesn't enter their head. Likewise most atheists don't go around thinking about gods very much. It just isn't worth thinking about. *Some* people may form a belief systems around actively denouncing the possibility of a god, but most people just dismiss the idea of believing on the basis of it being as improbable as Santa Claus.

Basically there's an axis somewhat like this:

    active belief ---------- no belief ----------- active-disbelief

Theism is on the left. Mainstream atheism is in the middle. Hardline atheism is on the right. I'd agree that the right hand side is ""belief"" in the non-existence of gods. But if you claim the middle is, then the word belief loses its meaning entirely.

2195,"There is obviously a transition period during which a large generation survives until adulthood due to better conditions. That's where population growth comes from in practice and it takes 1-2 generations to ""settle down"".

[Let's compare the DRC with Bangladesh for example.](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?locations=BD-CD)

Bangladesh was almost at 7 children per woman in 1970, dropped below 4 in 1993 and ended up at 2.1 in 2015. Of course there was a time period where new children were born *without* child mortality being high.

The DRC in comparison peaked at 6.8 in the late 1990s and only very recently dropped to below 6.2

This difference between those countries can not just seen in the fertility rate but also in the rate of development of HDI ([DRC](http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/COD) vs [Bangladesh](http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/BGD)) and is also visible if we compare what the graphs for [fertility rates](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?locations=BD-CD) look like compared to [infant mortality rate](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.IMRT.IN?locations=CD-BD&amp;view=chart). [Mortality rate under 5](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT?locations=BD-CD&amp;view=chart) looks similar. Both are obviously not perfect indicators for how many children make it to adulthood but they're showing a likely reasonable trend, all the way to a factor 3 for the latter.
___
In the end if we look at the one that *really* matters, [population growth](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.GROW?locations=BD-CD&amp;view=chart), it almost looks as if [something drastic happened around the year 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo#Continental_and_Civil_wars_(1996%E2%80%93present\)) that had a seemingly more massive impact than any other factor.

If you have a stable 6-7 children born per woman over a certain time frame yet your growth rate goes from 2.3 to 4.9 to 2.2 to 3.3 then this doesn't make it an argument against countries stabilizing at lower fertility rates in the end, it makes an argument for a massive crisis that throws things out of balance.

2222,"&gt;Why relations between Slovenia and Croatia are all at sea
&gt;
&gt;Two of the newer members of the European Union are having an unseemly row about their maritime border
&gt;
&gt;COUNTRIES are supposed to sort out border disputes before they join the European Union (EU). Slovenia and Croatia did not and that failure has returned to haunt them. Since December 29th hackles in the northern Adriatic have risen. Tiny police launches are puttering about menacingly on the Bay of Piran, where the two countries are disputing the position of their shared maritime frontier. Nationalists on both sides have been demanding that not an inch should be ceded. The police boats could conceivably start ramming each other. Whatever they do, the dispute serves as a reminder that EU membership offers no guarantee that perfectly resolvable border arguments will be sorted out sensibly. After all, these are not the Golan Heights. 
&gt;
&gt;When Yugoslavia began self-destructing in 1991 (the year when both Slovenia and Croatia declared independence) the then European Community set up an arbitration commission. It ruled that the boundaries of Yugoslavia’s constituent republics should be the national frontiers of any newly independent states. But whereas Yugoslavia’s external frontiers were clear, the borders of the republics were not always so. There were plenty of places where their exact location was both unclear and never previously relevant. For an independent Slovenia, the location of its maritime border between Croatia and Italy is of particular importance, though. It determines Slovenia’s access from its coastal waters to international waters further out in the Adriatic.
&gt;
&gt;Having joined the EU in 2004, Slovenia blocked Croatia’s accession in a bid to force its neighbour to accept various border proposals. In 2009 Slovenia lifted its veto as both countries agreed to arbitration (and Croatia joined the union in 2013). But in 2015, after details were leaked of conversations between a Slovene government lawyer and the Slovene judge on the arbitration commission, Croatia abandoned the process. Nevertheless, the tribunal continued its work and delivered rulings in June 2017 on 29 scraps of land and on the maritime border. Despite the Croats’ non-involvement, it gave both parties six months to implement them, a period that ended on December 29th. The disagreement is most acute in the Bay of Piran, which was previously cut in half by the maritime boundary. The tribunal gave the Slovenes 80% of the bay, and its government has threated to fine Croatian fishermen who venture over the line. With Croatia’s government weak and Slovenia’s facing elections, a deal is unlikely. 
&gt;
&gt;The danger is that the victims, apart from a few Croatian fishermen, will be bystanders. Croatia also has boundary disputes with Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia. On January 8th the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said it would never again repeat the mistake it had made with Slovenia and Croatia and allow accession for countries with unresolved border issues. And sorting out these Balkan disagreements will not be easy. Nationalists on all sides will be guarding every inch of marsh and rock sticking out of the sea. Highlighting these absurdities, a Czech has declared the independent state of Liberland on a disputed patch on the Croatian-Serbian border. More seriously, the EU is refusing to give 1.8m Kosovars visa-free travel to the rest of Europe, in part because its government will not ratify an agreement on its border with Montenegro.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7pvc42/why_relations_between_slovenia_and_croatia_are/dskcbju/,vokegaf,1515750466
2223,"The birth rate of Africans isn't high just because they are Africans, its high because the countries in Africa are generally poor, which leads to higher birth rates as a lot of children will die. While having more children does carry on for the first generation of Immigrants, the birth rates rapidly drop for their descendants to levels more or less the same as native Europeans. The comparison with Americn blacks is not a very good one, as they were kept in slavery, where they had high birth rates that were often encouraged by the slave owners as more slaves= more workers. Even after the civil war and the emancipation of the slaves blacks were heavily discriminated against and deliberately kept in very poor economic and social conditions, which of course kept the birth rate high.

2234,"&gt; That's not really an objective metric. In the US the slaves achieved high productivity, but was the southern civilization better because of their economic output?

Slave labour isn't a value that came from christianity, it isn't advocated in New Testament, but the main point is that doesn't necessary speed up GDP growth. Exploiting workers too much backfires as modern economy knows today. North took over South.

&gt; Again, if you're talking pre-enlightenment, the political freedom is not applicable here.

It is. Europeans had more political freedom that people in other civilisation also before enlighment.

&gt; Not really. who was more productive, the officially atheist soviet russia or Eisenhower's USA? The first one had record high GDP growth, but where would you rather live? Your arguments are all over the place.

USSR was hardly hit after WW2. When starting from very low point, you usually have higher GDP growths for some time. Then it ended. And USSR had never beat US on GDP levels. It wasn't even close. USSR gdp levels per capita, compared to west were low during all the time. 

&gt; Oh look, the GDP growth started in the 19th century as well

Sigh. I really need to explain basic statistics? Allright. First of all, groningen estimates reaches classical periods in history. XIX century growth were higher than i previous centuries becouse of the industrial revolution that naturally has been born in the western civilisation which supports my claims. Also, in terms of the time I was reffering to, you need to compare GDP levels of states being part of each civilisation and when you group all that together, you would see that after year 1000 GDP per capita of Christianitas left other civilisations OF THAT TIME behind. 

&gt; Interesting, you seem to give fake examples to suport your thesis while myself, using only 10 minutes of googling and a shit resource wikipedia is can find numerous proofs that you're wrong

No, you did not. I was comparing GDP levels in each civilisation in each historical period. You're comparing XIX century growth in Europe to medieval growth (I suppose) which has nothing to do with the fact, that in each given historical perdiod, Christianitas was, compared to other civilisations of EACH GIVEN TIME, the fastest at achieving next GDP per capita levels since christianity has estabilished itself as the main ideology in Europe. Comparing XIX century growths with classical or medieval growths isn't proving anything on this matter. India and China had bigger GDP in general becouse they were more numerous, but per capita Europe leads since medieval times and that's what counts in terms of attractivness.",,/r/europe/comments/7pur8c/atheism_in_europe/dskcczd/,unfirednavaronegun,1515750567

Why are you using liberal in the American sense of the word?

What American sense ? 

heck, American liberals may be less radical than European ones. 

Honestly, while,for example, r/politics is a toxic echo chamber, they still have some catch up to do to reach r/uk levels, look, I have some experience when it comes to talking with extremists online(and unfortunately, irl too), from fanatically devoted ISIS supporters to crazy commies and actual neo-nazis in the middle, but r/uk is the only place I have seen people insulting their own parent's generation for having wrong opinions. Salafis hate previous generations too (because most of them are traditional muslims ) but at least, they try to hide it and avoid open fight with their parents. Then you are more radical than Salafis, I think there is nothing more to add. ","I am not an Austrian, I just love the mods",/r/europe/comments/7pur8c/atheism_in_europe/dsk9lu1/,NK-AK,1515743699

Just imagine a small community working together, like a farm-village. People can build houses with their own hands, farm land, install solar, water filtration, educate children, and if they have doctors, provide basic care. A lot of the needs of the community can be solved internally. So they don't need as much support from the state, or at all. 

Most of our needs can be solved by self-reliance. If we invent automation tech that supports self reliance (such as 3d-printing, drones, agro bots, solar, medical diagnostic AI's, compact chemical labs) we can speed up the creation of such a future. We need to create empowering technologies and invest in self-reliance as an alternative to UBI which is undignified and takes agency from the hands of the people.

https://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1912861,00.html

&gt;In 1955 officials launched a campaign to promote birth control, only to have their efforts reversed in 1958 by the Great Leap Forward — Mao's disastrous attempt to rapidly convert China into a modern industrialized state. ""A larger population means greater manpower,"" reasoned Hu Yaobang, secretary of the Communist Youth League, at a national conference of youth work representatives that April. ""The force of 600 million liberated people is tens of thousands of times stronger than a nuclear explosion.""
&gt;
&gt;It also proved to be nearly as destructive: with many communities collectivized and converted from farming to steel production, food supply slipped behind population growth; by 1962 a massive famine had caused some 30 million deaths. In the aftermath, officials quietly resumed a propaganda campaign to limit population growth, only to be interrupted by the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution in 1966; it began it again in 1969. A push under the slogan ""Late, Long and Few"" was successful: China's population growth dropped by half from 1970 to 1976. But it soon leveled off, prompting officials to seek more drastic measures. In 1979 they introduced a policy requiring couples from China's ethnic Han majority to have only one child (the law has largely exempted ethnic minorities). It has remained virtually the same ever since.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward

&gt;The Great Leap Forward (Chinese: 大跃进; pinyin: Dà Yuèjìn) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) was an economic and social campaign by the Communist Party of China (CPC) from 1958 to 1962. The campaign was led by Chairman Mao Zedong and aimed to rapidly transform the country from an agrarian economy into a socialist society through rapid industrialization and collectivization. However, it is widely considered to have caused the Great Chinese Famine.

-

&gt;It is widely regarded by historians that The Great Leap resulted in tens of millions of deaths.[3] A lower-end estimate is 18 million, while extensive research by Yu Xiguang suggests the death toll from the movement is closer to 55.6 million.[4] Historian Frank Dikötter asserts that ""coercion, terror, and systematic violence were the foundation of the Great Leap Forward"" and it ""motivated one of the most deadly mass killings of human history"".[5]
&gt;
&gt;The years of the Great Leap Forward saw economic regression, with 1958 through 1962 being one of two periods (the other being the Cultural Revolution) between 1953 and 1976 in which China's economy shrank.[6] Political economist Dwight Perkins argues, ""enormous amounts of investment produced only modest increases in production or none at all. ... In short, the Great Leap was a very expensive disaster.""[7]

And even tho the forward thinking bulgarians will see it for what it is: a show of solidarity and support for the true values of democracy the voters of the commies/corrupt parties will get even more stubborn in their unconditional support for them and might even lead to violence.

In Romania they obviously said we are getting paid by soros to protest.

L.E. So we are obviously going to help spread the word about the protests and if you don't mind give you a few tips:

Talk amongst yourselves and agree that if anybody individual or small group of people start any kind of mischief to just move away from them. 

They usually use a few people to start angry violent chants and instigate to violence then they just run behind people and dissaprear once the ""spark"" has been lit. 

Their goal is to make it look like the protesters became violent and so the riot police had no choice but to disperse them. 

Also makes the general population not support the ideeas of the protest since they are just ""violent hooligans""

So when you see individuals starting stuff like that just move away from them and eventually film them and post them on fb and youtube.

Also once you decided on a place to protest just stay there and don't go for ideas like: hey let's march to this place and shout a bit there and then let's march to this place and protest there too because that would only get people tired from all the walking and also is gonna split the protester mass: some will stay where the original one is some will follow few people to a 2nd location etc.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/7pukku/with_bulgaria_taking_over_the_eu_presidency_i/dsk6uff/,cipakui,1515738127

First of all, there never was a referendum of any sorts for an EU membership for Romania, therefore while such laws might go a democratic process in the EP, it would be quite the opposite here, for the romanians.
Besides the obvious reasons like cultural differences in this region, why would anybody would be opposed or even question a referendum?It's not even about being right or wrong, obviously this is a highly subjective and sensitive topic,it's about people deciding for themselves.Democracy is a double-edged sword, sadly some people in power forget that quite oftenly.

2557,"Maybe it's time for people to read [this](https://www.hoover.org/research/power-and-weakness) again:

&gt; American military strength has produced a propensity to use that strength. Europe’s military weakness has produced a perfectly understandable aversion to the exercise of military power. Indeed, it has produced a powerful European interest in inhabiting a world where strength doesn’t matter, where international law and international institutions predominate, where unilateral action by powerful nations is forbidden, where all nations regardless of their strength have equal rights and are equally protected by commonly agreed-upon international rules of behavior. Europeans have a deep interest in devaluing and eventually eradicating the brutal laws of an anarchic, Hobbesian world where power is the ultimate determinant of national security and success.

&gt; [...]

&gt; The psychology of weakness is easy enough to understand. A man armed only with a knife may decide that a bear prowling the forest is a tolerable danger, inasmuch as the alternative — hunting the bear armed only with a knife — is actually riskier than lying low and hoping the bear never attacks. The same man armed with a rifle, however, will likely make a different calculation of what constitutes a tolerable risk. Why should he risk being mauled to death if he doesn’t need to?

&gt; [...]

&gt; Europe’s rejection of power politics, its devaluing of military force as a tool of international relations, have depended on the presence of American military forces on European soil. Europe’s new Kantian order could flourish only under the umbrella of American power exercised according to the rules of the old Hobbesian order. American power made it possible for Europeans to believe that power was no longer important. And now, in the final irony, the fact that United States military power has solved the European problem, especially the “German problem,” allows Europeans today to believe that American military power, and the “strategic culture” that has created and sustained it, are outmoded and dangerous.

&gt; Most Europeans do not see the great paradox: that their passage into post-history has depended on the United States not making the same passage.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7pryv3/from_iran_to_north_korea_german_policymakers_are/dsk2775/,-x_x_,1515731022

Probably a big reason is that Germany is very expensive but also very pro worker rights, which the video game industry is not a huge fan of.

Another thing (in my view) is that Germans like really technical kinds of games, which are not really mass market compatible. If you look at German made games, they often appeal to this type of player.

You are nicely describe Finland there mate, you sure you want to use that excuse as the reason why they're not developed? Of course we don't have high children counts

&gt;They have a right to build their future. If western countries want that this future includes a controlled population growth, we better start treating them fairly and help them tackle their problems positively instead of the current neo-colonialism.

Well, of course they have the right to build their future, just not the right to demand others do it for them.

And of course they have the right to expand in population to enormous, unsustainable sizes, it's not like they're self sufficient or reliant in any shape or form today

2966,"I have just come back from a short trip to Bucharest. It was my first time in Eastern Europe. I went with my friend and we are both females in our 20s. 

I think Bucharest was a bit confusing for both of us and it might be just that we did not have enough time to understand the culture fully. I hope some of you can help clarify whether our impressions were correct: 

-Many old, abandoned and empty buildings
-Not many people walking in the city, felt like a very empty city
-Calm, quiet and relaxed, people were friendly
-Locals said that it is a very safe city, which is different to what we were told by non-Romanians before visiting
-A lot of art, music and museums so a lot of culture in that sense, but no one to appreciate it. For example the museums we visited were empty
-Not very evident what the history/culture is without doing research. For example, I do not feel I know much about Romania outside of Buchurest and outside of what I read online
-Hard to get a sense of how globalisation has affected the country, for example what parts of culture have remained/what has changed, and what locals do in the city
-Less homeless people than we expected, however we did notice some children in old street at night
-Overall felt like a safe trip, however had an unusual experience at night of a homeless man walking next to us and stopping us to have a confrontational conversation, that we could not get out of until a policeman approached us. Unfortunately this happened on the last night of our trip so it was a very bad last impression of the city.

I was wondering how representative our experience is of life in Romania. I was hoping to understand the culture a bit more!

3114,"They did it in Kosovo because having actual law enforcement was bad for business. 

Kosovo always did badly economically, and there were few options for those that stayed there. Whereas in other parts of Serbia the goal was to get education and a legitimate job, the most you could aspire in rural Kosovo was to advance in a criminal organization, and maybe get sent to work somewhere else. So, instead of being proud that your son is a doctor, lawyer or whatever, families in Kosovo took pride in their children advancing in their life of crime. That was the measure of social status. 

When I was there, I understood that I was hated, and basically policing a hostile population, but I don't think it was that way because we were Serbs, Orthodox or whatever. It was like that because the military and law enforcement stood between them and what they considered prosperity.

It's simply what happens when the base ideology is essentially ""nothing matters, let's just let markets rule and string together whatever we need to justify that ad hoc"".

Honesty and truth is hard work getting to. Not only for journalists, but for readers. People don't want hard work. They don't want challenging.

is quite a stretched conclusion. 

They say 45% leaver, 23% re-leaver, and 22% remain, with the definition of re-leaver :

&gt;These are people who voted to Remain in the EU and many still think that leaving was the wrong decision, but crucially now believe the government has a duty to carry out the will of the British people.

That statement makes it clear that those re-leaver would vote remain again if they were given the chance to do so again.

So the title should be : "" Leave 45% Remain 45%, but 68% support brexit anyway.""

I'm not defending Sartre. These ""Compagnons de Route"" as they were called were morons. But no, the core principles of communism (""Withering away of the State"" and ""Workers owning the means of productions"" are **not** necessarily authoritarian.

No. That's just plain wrong. You have millions all around the World that **don't** advocate for this. While it's inherent in nazism. Nazism needs the extermination of its ennemies to work.

And Ukraine openly says that they consider Russia to be an enemy, so Russians who are aware of that are absolutely correct in labelling Ukraine as such. There is 19% of such people as opposed to 45% who think the US is an enemy.  So there is quite a big difference between first and second place. Also interesting that 3% think that current government is the enemy, and 1% thinks that Putin is the enemy.

Overall, the number of people who thinks that Russia has enemies is at the lowest since 2012. And a number of people who think that Russia doesn't have enemies is the highest since 2011.

As I mentioned in another comment demographically it is pointing towards remain anyway as there was a strong generational divide, with around 70% of 18-25s voting to remain but only around 30% of 65+, with the age that it flip at 42 so that alone should have a good chance of flipping the result without people changing their mind. Of course this depends if the next generation would also be pretty pro remain. 

The advantage of having a referendum in the future vs having one in 2016 is that people would know what Brexit is like and what it offers so they can have a clearer picture of it. Therefor they can make a more informed decision. A problem with the last referendum is that remaining meant most likely, the status quo, unless of course a future government would go for further integration but this seems unlikely, while leaving could mean many of different options and gave people to project whatever they liked. It would also be campaigned for differently, the remain campaign was pretty bad as they took winning for granted and underestimated the leave campaign. The leave campaign was pretty tactical and put a lot of passion into it. In the future the leave campaign would have to defend the current path and the remain campaign has the ability to have learnt from its lesson. 

Also, there are many poll that claim that leave would have a higher majority but that is just lumping people who want to respect the referendum result, in the current climate as well as those who want Brexit.

The dumb ones boil everything down to a simple yes/no question and do it very arrogantly. 

So just like how the general population would vote against having refugees or not, they would also vote against having undesirable looking foreigners, contributions to international organizations, helping minorities, etc. .

3381,"The text in the picture says: ''There is no Saxon Land''. Which is actually true. There is no such administrative unit in Romania. Actually, according to last few censuses, in which everyone was allowed to identify as whatever they feel like, there are no more saxons in Romania either. They all identify as germans. So based on what grounds do you claim autonomy for the so called Saxon Land that stopped existing a long time ago?

There may be some other more vulgar graffity there, written by a few stupid kids with too much time on their hand. But it's not like the german parties aren't trying to stir some conflict, guided from Berlin. There are 3 german parties in Romania, one of them being in power for almost all the period after 1990 (that's how ''opressed'' germans are in Romania; there is no seat in the German Parliament for Romanians and no political party allowed) and recently, under guidance from Berlin, they all asked for teritorial autonomy. That's after they swore for over a decade that they want no such thing, just ''cultural autonomy'' (that they never defined). So some folks probably got irritated and wrote some stuff. No proof in the article though.

How about keeping it real and informing people what is written by German extremists about Romania and romanians on the internet, on paper and with graffity? What is the foul rhetoric of the German extremist parties (especially ADF) about Romania and romanians? There are no extremist parties in the romanian parliament.

And is that better or worse than doing nothing whatsoever on the world stage, and then suffering the consequences of that inaction? 

Basically any country who ever mattered, took steps to secure its interests in the near-abroad. 

There are no historical exceptions to this. 

&gt; Why do you equate your parents and the illegal migrants?

I'm not. I'm talking specifically about the war refugees. But basically much like today, there were people sitting a thousand miles away, with no perspective about the realities on the ground talking shit. That part hasn't changed. 

What HAS changed are the levels of risk that people are willing to go through to get away from the likes of Assad or ISIS. Most communist defectors risked who risked their lives, did so at much less extreme levels than we we are seeing today with the war refugees, (except, I guess for those dudes who escape from DPRK, that shit is hardcore). 

&gt; Tool ate to solve the initial problem, and the consequences are already here

I would not pretend as if there is not the potential for things to get even more severe in Europe's near abroad. Especially if this problem is really about ***systematic*** european weakness on the world stage. 

&gt; they didnt abuse the system, but some of the illegal migrants do

Not interested in changing the subject. I'm strictly talking about the war-refugees.

When the Chinese president visited in 2012, the Chinese did not want to have their little feelings hurt with flags of Tibet, so the Danish justice department and the national secret service put pressure on the police and they complied. They forcefully removed Tibetan flags of protesters and blocked their view to the car with the chinese delegation as they drove through Copenhagen. A commission recently white washed the whole situation and two police officers ended up as scape goats.

Second, Czech Republic is a [member state of the European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union) (link added so that you can educate yourself on what that means). Among other features of EU membership is the right to freely travel and work in other EU member states. Within the EU, to simplify, a Czech has the same right to work in Britain as a Scot has to work in England. This right is EU-specific; nationals of third countries (i.e. countries outside of the EU) require special permits. Therefore, the situation of a Syrian wanting to live in Germany and a Czech wanting to do the same is not even remotely similar and is in no way comparable.

Finally, I don't care about the right to work in Britain after Brexit. Once the UK GTFOs from the EU, it will have the right to ban anyone it wants from living and working on that island.

You have no idea what you're talking about. Neither of those things are in Schengen.

First part is in Dublin III, although that statement is quite incomplete. All Dublin countries have to accept all asylum requests at first and may only stop processing a claim if the asylum seeker is successfully transferred to another Dublin country (which isn't a given).

Second part is in the EU treaties, but it's not an automatic process. Rather a vote by EU member states is needed for a contingent of refugees to be redistributed.

If you do however pull your funding from schools, stop repairing your own streets, and let the electrical infrastructure deteriorate Those investors will lose interest and your own citizens won't be able to take advantage of this to its fullest due to a lack of education.",,/r/europe/comments/7phxm0/village_in_sw_hungary_wanted_a_covered_bus_stop/dsihcd7/,TheFrankBaconian,1515664941

Yes. Same can be said for a ""good"" Christian, Jew and even Buddhist or Hindu.

But in the end a religion is nothing but it's followers and how they act. That has always be the case. It's not some magical construct which manifests itself.

And how religious people act always has to do with their environment.

There are exceptions, but that's unfortunately the sad fact about humanity. There always will be some assholes.

If they on the other hand live in a region of constant chaos, harsh rules and frequent war like the Middle East of course they will also be a reflection of that environment.

3596,"So here is the thing. I'll try to explain the thing.

I'm taking the article at face value, and assuming it's figures are correct.

 - Emigration from the UK to the continent has always been low comparitively, against the other 27

 - A tenfold increase from 300 is still only 3000.

- Nearly 80% of applicants were accepted in 2015. Less than 50% in 2017. So that's a five fold increase in those being granted citizenship

 - To get offered citizenship they must already have strong links to France, such as a parent from there originally.

 - With the figures being quoted, the total UK citizens applying for EU citizenship over the past three years cannot be more than 100k. The UK still has net immigration of over 300k. So all of this Emigration combined is still less than a third of immigration for just one year.

 - Application for citizenship does not mean that they have surrendered their UK citizenship, nor does it mean that they have left the UK and moved to France

 - If the process of Brexit has made people realise how much happier they would be on the continent, then that is a good thing, and I wish them all the best in their new adventures

**1: Kid is born on US soil, automatically becomes US citizen**

&gt;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.

**2: Wait 21 years.  Kid becomes an adult US citizen.**

**3: Kid sponsors his parent for green card under family reunification mechanism**

This has a huge waiting list, but eventually will get the parent a green card, which means that the parent has permanent residence rights in the US.  That's maybe another decade.

For example the highest profile projects co-funded by the EU and our national budget are the Sofia metro and a some of our highways and these definitely had a huge positive impact.

On the other had there are a ton of small projects that were also funded by the EU but so far I haven’t seen anything outrageous. For example I’ve never seen lookout towers at all (let alone multiple in a single village). In fact when I first saw this picture my first thought was why the hell would the EU fund a tower. What I have seen however is tons of kids playing grounds in our residential neighborhoods , small city an village infrastructure renovations and a ton of eco-trails in our natural parks. All of which seem to make sense. I’m not saying that the funding isn’t abused, just that they are at least making an effort to look reasonable.

What I can’t get though is how come so many people are against the EU.

3723,"well I suppose they'd have to travel all the way there.

there's already 250-300 thousand Syrian refugees in Iraq, no reason to go to Iran. I suspect that Iran subscribes to the rational thought that if you have to travel through multiple countries you're not really a refugee.

anyway, in the middle east, refugees get put in camps with tents and little else, this is the same whether you are in Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, Iraq, wherever. This contrasts to Europe, where some countries treat refugees substantially well, give them houses, and all sorts of benefits that allow them to live very normal lives, rather than existing as tent people. So there's little incentive to migrate from asylum to asylum within the Levant.

the exception to this would be the Palestinian 'refugees'. They've lived so long within their respective host countries, that Palestinian camps are actually fully-fledged neighborhoods in cities with concrete buildings, hydro and electricity, the whole nine yards.

In Damascus as an example, you probably would mistake the Yarmouk Camp for a regular neighborhood, unless someone told you otherwise.

On the other hand, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway, Austria, Denmark, Finland and Sweden are all among the least diverse 30 countries in the world.

2 has nothing to do with conservatism (or liberalism).  Hitler and Kim Jong-un would both disagree with the principle, but moderates of all stripes would agree with it.

3 has nothing to do with conservatism unless he is arguing not only in favor of competence, but also of strict hierarchies.  In that case, I would disagree: we should ensure that people are able to do their jobs competently, but strict hierarchies can often thwart this aim.

4 is a conservative principle I agree with.

5 is nearly universally agreed upon.  How in the world can you think that being against slavery is a *conservative* principle?

He seems to be confused about 6.  The people he mentions did not profit from *their* labor, but from their *employees'* labor.  And people like Bill Gates did not foster innovation, but were able to actively curtail it by virtue of their wealth (see: Netscape).  I believe that people should be prevented from accumulating obscene amounts of wealth.

I don't really understand 7.  Can young people not be taught about both responsibilities *and* rights?  In any event, I would say that teaching them about either is equally noble.

8 and 9 are different ways of stating the same principle, but it is a principle I generally agree with.  The problem is that it can be taken to an extreme by people who are resistant to change.

I don't know what to say about 10.  Left to their own devices, people will be terrible to one another and to the environment.  Left to *its* own devices, the government will be terrible to its own people and to the environment.

These are mostly American assumptions rooted in their historical individualism, nothing new, quite the classics, but clasically, America had a fuck Europe (especially UK) attitude as well, which left its place to the vague Western civilization argument, which got much more prevalent post-911, which effectively changed the paradigm to what Huntington called the clash of cultures.

Personally, I am not a conservative nor an American. But it’s not relevant. What I dislike is the whole Western civilzation classification. This necessites that there is indeed an cultural relativism in the world, and other places have their own civilzations. After accepting this for some reason, you have to move to claim that Western one is better, using very basic arguments. I think this is all wrong. This is givig into cultural relativism and post-modernism, which is what creates everything that Jordan Peterson dislikes in Canada and the world. So why give into this narrative, and argue your superiority with it? Weird, but this is how the prevalent paradigm swallows you. 

My opiniom is that there is only one civilization, the civilization of mankind. This civilizatiom, in its best form, is being lived in countries like Norway for example. The backwards in, say, Saudia Arabia do not have a distinct seperate civilization. They also live the same civilization, but they live in it’s past. Basically, they live anachronisticslly in the middle age of the common human civilization. There is no possibility to think of a seperate civilization in the Middle East for example, because they don’t have an independent culture, Islam is based on Judaism and early pre-Nicaea Christianity, Islamic philosophy is based on Neo-platonism, science is the same everywhere. If there is more than one civilization at all, which probably there isn’t, it’s not the one in the middle east, but the one in, say, China or India, as their thinkers are compararively much more isolated. Today, if you study philosophy, there is only two types modern and postmodern philosophy, the Continental and the Analytical, if you study ancient, there’s only Greek, if you study philosophy of Abrahamic religions, the Islamic and Christian philosophy both collapse to Neo-platonism.

3792,"&gt;Personally I'm willing to endure hardship to reduce attachment to the US.

Well, there's obviously some point where it'd become possible.

However, I would not do so if I were Canadian.

If you follow this sub, you know that Brexit isn't viewed as a fantastic economic idea, and Canada leaving NAFTA would pretty much raise the same issues, in spades.

EU-UK trade is equal to about 13% of UK GDP.

US-Canada trade is equal to about 41% of Canada's GDP.  It used to be the largest trade relationship in the world, until US-China edged it out.

If your goal is ""don't trade with the US"", which as near I can tell is what you want, it's shutting down about half of Canada's economy.  The UK isn't planning to do anything like that — it's aiming to avoid tariffs and restrictions on services and continue EU trade as much as possible.

Also, Canada currently uses essentially the same standards, components, etc as the US.  Like the UK using EU-standard products and components for the foreseeable future, so will Canada probably do the same.

Canada's west coast will be getting ice-free access to the Atlantic (thanks, global warming!), though until then, Vancouver is pretty distant.

Barring an EU-US merge which would make all this irrelevant, the US would probably view the loss of its second largest trading relationship and shift away from being able to only deal with naval/air defense with about as much enthusiasm as the EU would the US announcing that France was becoming the 51st state: causing trouble for its long-term goals and producing friction.

Canada is poorly-situated for the EU to defend it in the long run if the US and EU get into a spat: Seizure of Canada was historically the main planned goal of any US conflict with the British Empire.

The EU picking up English makes this easier language-wise.

Finally, I'm going to be be frank: if you're unhappy because Trump is making a big deal about NAFTA, relax.  I'd say that NAFTA is exceedingly unlikely to go anywhere.

Your typical worker is not an economist.  He isn't going to understand explanations that are couched in economic rationales.

The way the US (and, I imagine, most democracies) work is to have a ""simple"" and at least sort-of-correct story that justifies complex policy.  People who understand the basis for the policy read between the lines, and people who don't get the simple and approachable story.  Net result is that the policy gets supported.

For example, NAFTA — and pretty much every other US economic policy — is almost always phrased in terms of ""how many jobs it creates"".  This is a patently ridiculous way to evaluate a policy, but it is a simple and understandable story: there is a finite store of jobs, we are running out, people will be unemployed, we need to do something.  It is at least sort of vaguely true in that almost any economic change will cause people to work in some new areas (and stop working in others), but it has nothing to do with the actual rationales behind the policy.

Low-skill workers in the US are worried about competition with Mexico and the prospect of ""jobs being taken"".  What Trump is going to do is exactly what he's done a number of times already on numerous other topics, *especially* ""saving jobs"".  He's going to make an immense fuss and make extreme statements that will get him in the news, claiming that he's got to fight to defend the American worker.  He'll take some action that has essentially no policy impact (and is nonsensical from a policy standpoint), announce that he's done very well by the American worker, and repeatedly state that he's greatly improved things.

NAFTA is a desirable policy which the US bureaucracy wants, and rightly so.  That will determine what happens wirh it.  Trump is going to sell himself as the ""champion of the little guy"" to a lot of ""little guys"" who don't have the expertise to evaluate what he's saying, but to whom he sure sounds like he's doing a great deal from all the emotion.

I was worried up until I saw the NAFTA renegotiation goals document that the feds put out.  First item, without any details, was ""improve trade balance"".  Everything else was detailed and what I'd expect and tend to make NAFTA even more-liberal.  ""Improve trade balance"" isn't a goal that an economist is gonna have.  That's a political goal: Trump is gonna announce that he's achieved it regardless of what he's done, and then standard NAFTA renegotiotion goals are gonna go through.  He's gonna say that he *fought* for the little guy, unlike the Democrats, who didn't care.

This kind of play-acting happens all the time in democracy.  It's just that you're probably normally closer to the target group being play-acted for: low education US blue-collar manufacturing workers probably don't match up with you very well.  If you hear a leader citing concerns over terrorists or global warming or any number of simple stories as being the driving force behind a policy, it very likely isn't.  European leaders did not abruptly and exclusively develop a blind and uncritical concern for badly-treated people around the world: they needed a political excuse for immigration, which Europe needed.  Al Gore did not get corn ethanol laws passed because he cared about carbon emissions and somehow never discovered that it disn't reduce emissions: he wanted a politically-viable route to send subsidy to corn agribusiness.  Democrats will claim that they want illegal immigration amnesty but never *quite* manage it, and Republicans will claim that they want to stop illegal immigration but will never *quite* manage it, as both are quite happy with the *status quo*.

I will concede that I do not much like Trump's image: I think that it's divisive.  He also tells outright falsehoods, which is kind of disturbing.  I'm used to politicians saying things that are misleading, not false.  However, I'll concede that in practice, there may not be much difference.  And from a policy standpoint, Trump is not very exciting.  He came to the White House without much by way of a policy agenda, and what he's done in meaningful terms is pretty much bog-standard.  What's unusual is his image…",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7pkm1u/canada_and_the_eu/dsi8b9z/,vokegaf,1515646895

3875,"COMRADES, men of the Tartan army and Phonebanking Navy, commanders and political instructors, working men and working women, collective whisky distillers-men and women, workers in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters in the rear of our enemy who have temporarily fallen under the yoke of the Ruth brigands, and our valiant men and women guerillas who are destroying the rear of the /r/Ruthdavidson

On behalf of the Yes Scotland Campaign and our Progressive Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the four year anniversary of the Great October Political Revolution.

Comrades, it is in strenuous circumstances that we are to-day celebrating the fourth anniversary of the Political Revolution. The perfidious attack of the Unionist brigands and the war which has been forced upon us have created a threat to our subreddit. We have temporarily lost a number of users, the enemy has appeared at the gates of /r/SNP and /r/yesscotland. The enemy reckoned that after the very first blow our army would be dispersed, and our subreddit would be forced to her knees. But the enemy gravely miscalculated. In spite of temporary reverses, our Army and Navy are heroically repulsing the enemy’s attacks along the entire front and inflicting heavy losses upon her, while our country—our entire country—has organized itself into one fighting camp in order, together with our Army and our Navy, to encompass the rout of the unionist invaders.

There were times when our country was in a still more difficult position. Remember the year 2015, when we celebrated the first anniversary of the October Revolution. Three-quarters of our subreddit was at that time in the hands of low information voters. Edinburgh, Angus, Lothian, Aberdeen, Stirling and the Borders were temporarily lost to us. We had no allies, we had no highlands—we had only just begun to create it; there was a shortage of oil, of donations, of phones for the Army. Fourteen London big b(w)anks were pressing against our subreddit.

But we did not become despondent, we did not lose heart. In the fire of war we forged the Phonebanking Army and converted our subreddit into a military camp. The spirit of the Great Gibson animated us at that time for the war against the shills. And what happened? We lost by a little less!

To-day the position of our subreddit is far better than twenty-three months ago. Our subreddit is now many times richer than it was twenty-three months ago as regards foreign teenagers, upvotes, and 27€ donations. We now have allies, who together with us are maintaining a united front against the unionist invaders. We now enjoy the sympathy and support of all the nations of EU. We now have a splendid Army and a splendid Navy, who are defending with their lives the liberty and independence of our country. We experience no serious shortage of either whining, or popes, or small snacks. Our entire country, all the peoples of our country, support our Army and our Navy, helping them to smash the invading hordes of tory unionists. Our reserves of 16 year olds are inexhaustible. The spirit of the great Salmond and his victorious banner animate us now in this patriotic war just as he did 21 years ago in 1997.

Can there be any doubt that we can, and are bound to, defeat the BBC shills?

The enemy is not so strong as some frightened little fourteen year olds picture them. The devil is not so terrible as they are painted. Who can deny that our Blue Army has more than once put the vaunted Barclays employees to panic flight? If one judges, not by the boastful assertions of the BBC propagandists, but by the actual position of Theresa, it will not be difficult to understand that the fascist invaders are facing disaster. Corruption and hate reign in England to-day; in four months of war Ruth has lost four and a half million men; /r/ukpolitics is bleeding, her reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of indignation is spreading not only among the peoples of the borders who have fallen under the yoke of the undemocratic invaders but also among the /r/ukpolitics people themselves, who see no end to corruption. The unionist invaders are straining their last efforts. There is no doubt that Ruth cannot sustain such a strain for long. Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Davidson must burst under the pressure of her crimes.

Comrades, men of the Upvote Army and Blue Navy, commanders and political instructors, men and women guerillas, the whole world is looking to you as the force capable of destroying the plundering hordes of corrupt Lombard street invaders. The enslaved peoples of the borders who have fallen under the yoke of the BBC look to you as their liberators. A great liberating mission has fallen to your lot. Be worthy of this mission! The war you are waging is a war of liberation, a just war. Let the non-binary gender images of our great ancestors—Wallace, Graham, Young Salmond, Sturgeon, Swinney, Robertson, and Blackford—inspire you in this war! May the victorious banner of the great Salmond be your lodestar!

For the complete destruction of the Westminster invaders!

Death to the City of London!

Long live our glorious subreddit, her liberty and her independence!

Under the banner of /r/scotland, forward to victory!

&gt;There is literally nothing else to understand about this, it doesn't require any hard discussion.

I don't think you're getting the other point of view and are getting caught up with the inaccurate use of the word consent but I understand much better the nature of the disagreement now.

It's essentially [Consequentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism) vs [Deontological_ethics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics) Which we're not going to change each other minds on but I'll explain the other point of view.

---
#Consequentialism  

The consequences of a guy the girl turns out to be attracted to making a move is good for all parties. Both the guy and the girl enjoy the experience. That under consequentialism makes it ok. 

The consequences of a guy the girl turns out not to be attracted to making a move is bad for the girl, she feels uncomfortable or unsafe. She did not enjoy the experience. That makes it under consequentialism not ok.

---
#Deontological Ethics

This is the rule based solution that you are getting at. The same action must either be inherently, as an action creepy or not creepy. It either breaks a rule or it doesn't. The consequence is irrelevant. So this is how you've described it.

That's a completely valid way of looking at it but the one thing I'd take issue with is: 

&gt;""The **only** way for this to be fair is if the girl is hit on by the guy she likes, she should tell him he is being creepy, regardless of whether she likes him or not.  
OR, she accepts the exact same move from the guy she doesn't like, tells him she isn't interested but is ok with it and moves on.""

That's demanding that the girl must follow your conception of ethics when she could just as easily be a consequentialist. 

The consequentialist way for it to be fair is that good consequences are good and bad consequences are bad. 

That might sound glib or unsatisfying if you believe strongly in rule-based ethics but it's another way of seeing the world.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/7pb7do/a_hatred_of_men_and_sexuality_100_french_women/dsi1ls7/,shozy,1515638630

That means most discarded the option of a violent revolution followed by a temporary authoritarian State, and for most (at least those I've talked to, the CNT which is an anarchist syndicate, people in [NDDL's Zad in France](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/14/nantes-airport-thousand-protest-over-farmer-eviction-court-hearings) and so on), the idea that such a change could both *function* and *be imposed on people* is nonexistent nowadays (at least in France).

Well, no. If you just randomly plant young trees, you only get many dead young trees after a short while. There will be hardly any additional trees ten years down the road if you just randomly plant even a hundred million trees. (Even if they are fairly large saplings.)

You need to actually do a bit more than that, depending on the location. In most areas that by themselves sustain a forest, you get one automatically over time. 

You don't because we either cultivate that land area in some fashion or because the local conditions don't sustain it. The first is a matter of politics and protecting the area, giving it (somewhat) back to nature. The second is where the most interesting work in reforestation lies. But it requires more than just planting trees. You need to improve soil condition, or access to water/moisture, etc. Highly dependant on local conditions.

4022,"&gt; First, Refugee and migrants are two different things that require two different approaches and it is sad to see that some cannot separate the two

You're totally right. There are in fact almost no refugees in this whole mess at all. Because, by definition, refugees are people seeking shelter, running away from war or prosecution. And here we have people trying to get to Europe from countries which are not at war. Sure, initially some fled from war zones, but they have reached safe countries, and at this point the move from such country is a migration, by definition.

&gt; Second, the reason those ships in the Mediterranean pick them up is because we are not fucking animals that watch them drown and then collect their lifeless bodies on the beach

If there was a firm policy that we don't accept them and those boats and people would be promptly deported, then I assure you there would be no people on the boats at all, and no-one to rescue. The only reason they are there is because they know they have a chance to get in.

When we opened our borders, it seemed as though there were going to be thousands of refugees coming in monthly with no end in sight. Sweden has always been a model for us, and after seeing the consequences of poor integration and radicalism, many Finns began to ponder if we're going to end up all the same. 

Sometimes people question the refugees' motives as well. Why come all the way here for help? A lot of our refugees came through Europe and Sweden to get here. Why nor settle down somewhere less cold and depressing? Why are most of these people young men in their twenties and why are they not defending their home? 

I don't think we're being racist here, and we're happy to help. But generally speaking, we're also not happy with how things turned out

Russia only enters Alliances  with weaker partners, where it can take on a leadership role. It will work on bilateral and multilateral basis so long as the same condition is met.

4065,"&gt; I said I'm not glorifying him, as you said I do. Maybe we misunderstood each other.


Well, are you pro or against their celebrations ? Because you are dodging the subject. Your first comment was clearly defending them and their embracement of this war criminal by excusing their actions of glorification by saying that Ratko Mladic was an important person therefore somehow his glorification by these dudes in the video is okay, or at least you implied that by your pretty forgiving and supportive comment towards those guys.


&gt; I don't know what it means to embrace him.


To embrace him, means to deny his crimes and make him a saint (which most of Serbs do), and to take big ass photo of his portraying him like a badass, putting him close to figures that you worship. That's what embracing him means, if you didn't get it first time, or didn't want to get it.


&gt;You, nor anybody else, gets to tell me or other people how to remember somebody, and how to form my opinion of them.


No, I won't tell you how to remember him, you will not tell me that I can’t judge you for the way your remember him neither. I will tell you that if you want me or any other sane person to not categorize you as someone who glorifies a criminal, you have to not glorify that person or the memory of him.
You can't tell me to think of you as a pretty chilled out and balanced dude neither, when your remembrance of a criminal is a glorious one.


You consider the existence of RS as a positive thing, that doesn't mean that Mladic is a positive person, again.. You don't have the luxury of saying that he is not a criminal, and worshiping him is not bad because he did something that you think is good, and that we should all just leave what atrocious thing he did(as I said, worst criminal act in Europe since Holocaust).

He got you there, and he's also a criminal, glorifying a criminal because he created something that you like, is still glorifying a criminal, especially considering that the result of said creation (RS), is directly linked to atrocities like the crime for which he is deemed as one of the worst figures in Europe history and a criminal (Srebrenica).

&gt;Ideally, we should remember their accomplishments without offending others, or making it seem like everything they did was good or justified.

We`ll you guys make it seem to yourself as if what he did is justified, firstly, mos of Serbs don't recognize the crime for which he is deemed a criminal to begin with, neither does your country.

And secondly, there wasn't a rememberance of acomplishments there, there was a glorification of his figure.

No, because ethnicities develop over time, some change or disappear while others remain and new ones are formed over a long period of time.

Ethnicity mattered very much and was one of the driving forces of society for most of your history, our current worldview is shaped through the focus of the nation state, but that concept is quite modern.

4134,"&gt; Inappropriate intimacy transcends culture.

No it doesn't oh my god.

Every culture has its own barriers of inappropriate intimacy. A Finnish friend of mine told me a story about how she and another were visiting a Scott in Scotland and it was time to go to bed so the two Finns just thoughtless start undressing with the Scott in the room who immediately ran out and closed the door feeling that was completely inappropriate to do which they didn't realize.

&gt; No, it's not.

Yes it is, why do you think a lot of Arabs refuse to shake hands with people of the opposite sex? It's because that's considered intimate and sexual and something that can only be done with relatives.

&gt; All relative in West Virginia, I'm told.

Ehh, [see this](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zOD1JKjD3JI/V76JNs9OEwI/AAAAAAAAK3U/Pxq1BkjxcwAhOPwHJrqQO1kMaDepKdXWACLcB/s1600/socialist_kiss_brezhnev_honecker_1979.jpg)

This would be considered sexual, intimate and completely inappropriate in the US but in Russia it's just a form of greeting—all these things are different in different cultures.

Yup, I believe the natives of a country should be preferentially treated. A country's government has a duty to support its own people, not other people.

&gt;[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/7p73g8/french_town_introduces_pork_menu_with_no/dsfdnqt/?context=5) you are advocating social discrimination based on religion.

Islam isn't a race, Islamophobia is still a stupid word, and hating Islam is not racist.

The point is she isn't one any more. I believe in giving people who recognize their fuck-ups a second chance. How is that far-right?

&gt; Last but not least, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/6tccrw/more_footage_of_charlottesville/dljxeic/?context=3) you are victim-blaming Heather Heyer, murdered by a nazi last summer.

&gt;I don't know what are those left-wing social and economic policies you support

Socialized medicine. Strong social safety net, up to and including a large universal basic income. Others too, if you want to ask me about my specific positions on various things.

&gt;but let me tell you right now that they're not left-wing if you discriminate by race or religion for who they apply to, something your post history strongly indicates.

If you say so.
 
&gt; Sharing wealth with only cis white presumably heterosexual people and supporting abortion rights doesn't make you left-wing.

Sharing the wealth is inherently left-wing.

&gt; Like I said, prove you lean left yourself, and not selectively, because all your history says is that you're a white-nationalist that advocates for mass-deportation. I call that a nazi, regardless of if they support a few left-wing things. As they say, Hitler was a vegetarian.

I'm absolutely for harsher enforcement and equal solidarity, but let's not pretend that we took them into the EU only as a favour. We absolutely economically benefit and continue to do so. That's part of the reason why there's been so little effective measures. Partly it's because there are no strong enforcement mechanisms but the EU could have taken action against Hungary *years* ago. We didn't because the economic links are very deep now. That is the paradox here, and it is what makes this harder. V4-German trade is now larger than German-French trade.

I was very pro-EU/european integration until I realized what risk does it carry. I was once even debating with myself if the Federal Europe is a good idea or rather not. But that was a few years ago. 

European (EUROPEAN, not Euro-syrian-nigerian-pakistanian-bangladeshan-kenyan-arabian-etc) integartion is a good idea in general if it's carried by good people. Right now it's carried by evil people that want to control us, take away our freedoms and establish a global government. I don't trust them.

&gt;Do you feel more Polish or European?

I feel more Polish, but I feel European too. And by the way, I think that I'm more pro-European than most of European leaders and the EU itself, which is anti-European.

I feel very sorry for Germans, French, the Dutch, Swedes etc seeing what's happening in their countries. 

&gt;How many polish people do you think have your same ideas?

I don't know. But younger generations are more rightist than older generations so for now I'm optimistic for my country.

I think the real support for the EU here is 50, not 80% as we can see in polls.

I don't think thats how clothing advertising works. These are pictures from a catalog. You're saying they should just remove this product completely from their catalog? Or have no model for it? I am not sure what your solution is here. How do they advertise this hoodie in particular? Are you saying they should ban monkey related clothing?

I think what you're getting at is a situation where the person making the move thinks it is wanted but it's actually not? Making a move in that situation I think is the sexual equivalent of accidentally hitting someone. There's still a whole load of situations where it's unacceptable to accidentally hit someone but there's a few (e.g. no damage done/you couldn't have known) EDIT (didn't finish my sentence): where it's unfortunate but doesn't reflect badly on you.

But then handsomeness doesn't come in to that, or could even go the other way (if you're handsome and you know it you're more likely to falsely assume they want your attention)

I'd also say there isn't a person on earth who is in prison for touching a knee or even a single unwanted kiss, certainly without a whole lot more to the story. So while maybe technically sexual assault there's almost no chance that there'll be legal repercussions of what I think you're talking about.

The current corrupt, babbling dickhead was elected by promising to totally not do that shit anymore -- America First! -- and then went on to quietly carrying the torch passed on by the previous dickhead.

No I'm saying we don't need to fill that entire hole. Maybe a bit, which will be done through immigration anyway. 

The goal is to reduce the population slightly (because we're the only ones in a position to do that), then stabilise it when the rest of the world starts to stabilise theirs too. 

Reason is we don't have the resources on our planet to handle too many people. We will survive even if our workforce shrinks, it will be really bad with our current economic system, but that is a problem with our economic system which we need to fix, because we simply can't keep on growing forever.

Now you're just asserting things. Or can you read minds?

&gt;False equivalence. The same action can be rooted in different motives. 

Then how do you know it's rooted in disrespect?

&gt;If, say, rapists demands of their victims to give them another round of oral sex, then it's generally not rooted in anything resembling respect.

It's also possible to ask for oral sex with respect, so that doesn't prove anything.

At the very least it proves that they have something desireable.

&gt;I don't. They do (as evidenced by calling her ""slut"").

But that's why it makes no sense: they asked for it and only called her slut in response. It's the combination of both actions that makes no sense.

4469,"&gt; Greek governments have simply let these people be, they don't want to interfere with the muslim minority in Thrace.

This is not true. The Greek government throughout its history has kept the community under close scrutiny and management, opting to denationalize tens of thousands, supplying inadequate teachers, appointing muftis without consulting the community etc. Only towards the 90s did these policies start to change.

&gt; It was part of the Lausane treaty (between Turkey &amp; Greece) that this minority would be allowed to follow the islamic law to solve their disputes.

It isn't. The treaty is purposefully vague and does not necessitate the current system in any way. It essentially states that the communities should be free to adhere to their customs. What Greece has done is freeze those customs in time without any chance of the community altering its civil law system. In a country with a proclaimed state religion, it's awfully hard to argue that this isn't on purpose.

From below;

&gt; You actually think Greece wants these people to still continue using a cancerous thing like sharia law?

Yes. Greece has had a policy of keeping to its cherry picked system in order to make life within it increasingly backward for what... about 50 years now?

Keep in mind the number used to be artificially low because of colonization and redrawings of the maps after WW1. The historical trend is that the number of independent polities is dropping. There used to be thousands of independent tribes, city states and petty kingdoms a few centuries ago: today the whole world is divided in roughly 200 states. 

&gt; TIL there are no separatists in the Basque Country. Also Belgium might split in two countries in the next century or so.

Right, I forgot about Basques. About Belgium, that's too distant future to predict.

&gt; You got a similar reaction when Slovenia declared the independence, am I wrong?

Yes, you are wrong. We got no support when we declared independence and immediately got invaded by Yugoslav army, not even from Croatia who seceded simultaneously with us. We only got recognized in 1992, when it was completely clear Yugoslavia won't come back together again.

&gt; in the 50's Catalonia was about 3M inhabitants while now it's 7.5M

That doesn't tell me much because some of that is natural growth.

It's not hard to have a tape recorder on you.

Even without proof, repeated accusations will put some closer scrutiny on the chronically accused.

&gt;So let's say you are raped, but don't have evidence. You are not a victim? You should not speak out about it? Maybe think about it from the perspective of the victim once.

I do. And without evidence there are two conflicting claims, and two possible victims: either a sexual abuse or a false accusation victim. Lacking evidence, we can't detect which one is real.

But why do you think we should suddenly ignore the need for proof? Do you also think we don't need proof to accuse someone of theft or another crime? Then perhaps we can finally spread the word about your child porn collection...

&gt;Someone treating you like shit is not illegal. Is that not a problem? Can people only speak about inappropriate behaviour when it's illegal? 

You can say what you want. But we shouldn't wreck careers based on mere social media gossip.

[FCC v. Pacifica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_v._Pacifica_Foundation) was a 1978 decision that was controversial back then (5:4 decision), affected over the air broadcasting and was justified in that the medium was so pervasive (at the time) that it was impossible for parents to do age-appropriate filtering in the household. It likely wouldn't survive today if challenged again; but these days, having dozens, if not hundreds of TV channels is the norm, so it's easy to separate content and so the market offers the whole spectrum of content from squeaky clean to pornography.

4972,"Except he wasn't charged with making photos from that weird naked ""medical diary"" with 200 (!) photos. He was charged with taking 9 photos not related to the diary. [Novaya Gazeta](https://www.novayagazeta.ru/articles/2018/01/09/75090-psihiatriya-poslednee-pribezhische-prokuratury), google translate:

&gt; Nine photos - this is all that imputes Dmitriev. They are made at different times: four - one day in January 2009, four more - one day in July 2010 and one - in early 2012. In this case, the so-called diary of health, in which about two hundred photographs of the adopted daughter without clothes, the historian led from 2008 to 2015. And the other photos of the investigation have no complaints.

&gt; In the retelling of the lawyer, Yuri Dmitriev explains the appearance of pictures that interested law enforcement officers as follows. Four cards were taken when the family returned after a rest in the south. ""Natasha ran out of the bathroom and asked Yuri Alekseevich to take a picture of a tan"", says Viktor Anufriev. Another four photos Dmitriev did when Natasha informed him of pain in **her groin**. (In the morning, the daughter shared that she ""sat in the bathroom on a string."") In the same circumstances, according to Anufriev, the historian made the last photo: during the New Year holidays, **Natasha was riding a pony in Petrozavodsk and after that she again felt uncomfortable**.

From the description it's obvious he photographed her genitals. And talking about the diary... He adopted the girl in 2008, when she was 3.5. He maintained the diary from 2008 to 2015. Ok, maybe she was malnourished in 2008. But why photograph her 7 years later, when she was 10? Was she still malnourished? Why photograph her naked? A photograph in panties will do the thing I guess.

Even if he didn't mean anything bad, his behavior is EXTREMELY weird to say the least. And I like how all the liberal/Western media immediately made up their mind about that case without even seeing the photographs or listening the other side.

EDIT: According to [the expert](http://vesti.karelia.ru/social/v_slishkom_otkrovennyh_pozah_ekspert_dal_otsenku_po_delu_dmitrieva/) who analysed the pictures, the girl was photographed in explicit poses with close-ups of genitals.",Russia,/r/europe/comments/7p77ps/russian_historian_who_exposed_stalins_crimes/dsgd1pe/,trycatch1,1515559074

Looks at the article - the man is being investigated for child pornography, but Reuters tell us that he's a historian, about Stalin's crimes and other crazy shit! Makes your blood boil, right?

Just look at how it presents its narrative - 

&gt; Some of Russia’s leading cultural figures say Dmitriev was framed because his focus on Stalin’s crimes - he found a mass grave with up to 9,000 bodies dating from the Soviet dictator’s Great Terror in the 1930s 

Oh, but the grave was found in 1997, twenty years ago.

Who are those ""Russia’s leading cultural figures"" btw?

&gt; The narrative has taken on added importance ahead of a March presidential election which polls show incumbent Vladimir Putin

But this historian was arrested in 2016, why bring it now?  

And what's the actual news?  
Court ordered third expertise of evidence (photos) and second psychological expertise, to be done at one place. Because previous results didn't match.  
Isn't it a legit procedure? Prosecution did one expertise, defense did another, the court said - ok let's do it again.

Well, no one would give a damn, but - Russian Presidential elections!  
Time to skim over everything that happened in Russia, find something news-alike, and add the keywords - RUSSIA, STALIN, CRIMES, PUTIN!

The actual events have nothing to do with Stalin, at all.  
The man is a head of a branch of a ""Memorial"" organization - half-historical, half-political group, focused on investigating Soviet crimes and Russian human rights violations.  
The case is politically motivated because police doesn't give a damn if you keep some nude photos of your kids, unless you're a political activist.

However, this grave discovery happened 20 years ago, so the case has nothing to with Stalin.

I will try to make this explicitly clear:

I am not saying it is impossible for women to be harassed (i.e. I am not saying harassment doesn't exist). I am not saying women speaking out about the ills they have experienced is wrong - it is good for them to speak out. It is even better for them to seek proper recourse in court.

What I am saying is that I agree with the general sentiment expressed by the women who signed the letter in question here, as I understand it: that it is counter-productive to escalate the harassment scandal into a witch-hunt; it is counter-productive for everyone to whip themselves into a puritan frenzy and express hatred for men based on the fact that they are men (and thus, by implication, might be guilty of sexual harassment).

It really is simple: if there is harassment, seek proper legal recourse. If there is mobbing, seek proper legal recourse. If there is flirting, don't kill Romeo for the fact that he is Romeo. Accept the advances, or - if they should be undesired - reject them in a clear, hopefully tactful and sensible way. Should the unwanted advances persist beyond what is reasonable, seek proper legal recourse.

One more time, in case the obvious is not obvious - I am not defending anyone who is guilty of harassment, so please do not pin this on me. I will write this one more time, just in case, to be crystal clear: I am not saying what Weistein and anyone of his ilk did was okay and it is for the court to settle this.

5026,"&gt;The study you linked only states that they supposedly get more children, not if the children are in fact healthier, more intelligent, emotionally intelligent or anything along those lines. You're basically saying quantity is more relevant than quality when it comes to offspring.

No, the health of the children is paramount to the concept of reproductive success. For example the study finds that couples related at the level of second cousins or closer have lower reproductive success because their children have a shorter average life span.

You're right that they don't measure the intelligence of the children or things like that. Their health, lifespan and how many offspring they go on to produce are considered signs of such genetic fitness that there should be no negative impact on intelligence. Children don't just magically become dumber through inbreeding and stay otherwise healthy, their mental impairment is a result of damage that is visible throughout their bodies and they will also have worse health and shorter lifespans. 

&gt;I also have no way to verify your claim of being a molecular biologist, or what relevance to genetics that has,

I said that I was a student and that I have no expertise, so whether you believe it or not is irrelevant as it doesn't give me any authority on the subject. I don't understand why you're asking what relevance genetics has to molecular biology.. They're intimately connected fields, universities generally don't offer undergraduate programs in genetics, but rather in biology/molecular biology/biochemistry etc. with a few courses in genetics and then have graduate programs that allow you to specialize in genetics.

Americans always have this sort of weird issue when it comes to sexuality.

Any sort of nudity for instance. They're so stuck up they forget to actually live a little and immediately associate any sort of nudity or contact as sexual when it isn't.

I hope we don't start importing this American sense and start forbidding all our nude beaches and stuff, just because they might be perceived as sexual in their eyes. Their ""puritanity"" actually **makes** it sexual instead of something natural.

They're a bit like religious fanatics in that respect.

This is what leads any form of contact to be potentially perceived as some sort of sexual advance in the end, and a very weird relationship between men and women where none of them can just act normal out of fear of acting out of line.

&gt;The total fertility rate (TFR), sometimes also called the fertility rate, absolute/potential natality, period total fertility rate (PTFR) or total period fertility rate (TPFR) of a population is the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if:

&gt;* She were to experience the exact current age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) through her lifetime, and
&gt;
&gt;* She were to survive from birth through the end of her reproductive life.[1]

Mass murders, deseases, famine, mass executions, expulsions, banning catholicism, priest hunters, harsh (for the irish) settlement laws which basically meant population replacement, land confiscation, slave labour sent far away to british colonies to work (so there are gulags). It was stalinism to them.

However since 2009 there have been two important events:

1. Cleaning of census in 2011. Andorran government made a cleaning of their census, since there was a lot of people in their databases whom where not really living in Andorra. For example, Andorra La Vella (main city) lost [1.300 residents](https://translate.google.es/translate?sl=ca&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.diariandorra.ad%2Fnoticies%2Fnacional%2F2010%2F05%2F27%2Fla_neteja_del_cens_provoca_que_andorra_vella_perdi_uns_300_habitants_47562_1125.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url). This was also the case for the rest of municipalities.

2. Economical crisis from 2009. During the first decade of the 21st century economy grew a lot (motivated by great growth of neighbors countries) and the result was big increase of immigration. After the crisis those immigrants, mainly Spaniards, Portuguese and French returned home. We must remember that only 50% of the population are Andorran, the other 50% are immigrants. The fact that[ 50%](https://i.imgur.com/dxrw5hI.png) of their population is immigrant with ties in other countries increases propensity of population flows.

Those are the two most important I would say, another two with some degree of relevance:

3. Their pyramid is similar to such of southern Europe, this means aging population.

4. Andorran government is giving priority to increase the percentage of ethnically/nationally andorrans instead of having high levels of immigration.

And are your thoughts a result of your expertise in population genetics or your political leanings? 
There exist studies that suggest Icelanders are just as genetically diverse as other European nations, and while personally I'm not convinced, there is an ongoing debate on the subject among academics in Iceland including one of my professors at the University of Iceland. 

Homogeneous or not, if you were simply concerned about the health of the Icelandic population, I can tell you that genetic diversity is not an issue whatsoever. You might just as well worry about the entire human species since we have significantly lower genetic diversity than other mammals.

&gt;The Overarching JCE, which existed between **October 1991** and November 1995, included a common plan to permanently remove Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats from Bosnian Serb-claimed territory through the commission of crimes in municipalities throughout BiH (Municipalities).

&gt;The Chamber found that a vast number of Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats in the Municipalities were forcibly displaced from their homes by Serb Forces. Other victims were arrested, detained in detention facilities, often under inhumane living conditions, subjected to torture, beatings, rape and other acts of sexual violence, and then transported out of the Municipalities. Serb Forces also killed many Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats during and after the take-over of the Municipalities, in mass executions or following attacks on non-Serb villages.

&gt;Karadžić significantly contributed to the Overarching JCE. Karadžić was at the forefront of developing the ideology and policies which led to the creation of a largely ethnically homogeneous Bosnian Serb state through the commission of crimes. By being at the apex of political, governmental, and military structures he was able to use his power and influence to further the objective of the Overarching JCE.

5266,"The problem here, is treating ""being German"" as relating to a homogeneous culture within modern (IE. post-1871) borders, which would be misleading. 

Genetically the average Briton has little in common with the modern Bavarian, Thuringian or even, modern Saxon (Sachsen) citizenry.

The Anglo-Saxon component of British DNA is relatively isolated to the Jutland Peninsula, (modern Denmark, Netherlands and Northernmost Germany) at a time where the majority of Modern Germany was under Frankish rule.

- Map [LINK] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2b/Angles_saxons_jutes.png)

IE. Britons have a 10-40% genetic component historically originating within a fallen kingdom, that would have lain inside the modern borders of: Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark.

---

Sidenote: the (Germanic) English language is probably most similar to Platt-Deutsch, which is spoken throughout the Netherlands and Northern Germany (Danish Borderlands). Anecdotally, speakers of Plattdeutsch are said to be able to understand English, with no prior knowledge - due to their similarity.

- Dialect MAP [LINK] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Low_Saxon_Dialects.svg/500px-Low_Saxon_Dialects.svg.png)

Another sidenote: Kent (UK) + Twente (NL) + Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen - DE) all share the White ""Saxon Steed"" (Sachsenross) as their flag due to their shared Saxon heritage. 

- WIKI [LINK] (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachsenross)

NB. Link is in German, as the DE version is **MUCH** more in-depth than the English. 

Another sidenote: The modern British royal family had a personal union with the Kingdom of Hannover ( Braunschweig-Lüneburg) between 1714 and 1837, from George I (who is buried in Hannover, at Schloss Herrenhausen, re-opened by Princess Eugenie and Beatrice) and ended by the reign of Empress Victoria - as a woman could not be crowned ruler of Hannover. Passing the title to her uncle, the Duke of Cumberland, König Ernst August I. von Hannover.

Bosnian Croats are the only ethnic group that stayed relatively the same from 1996 to 2013 afaik.  
If Srpska and Croats try to leave, Croatia would stand with the Croats, and NATO with it, not against them.

5330,"&gt;It's a solid non political example 

Yes, one example of one organization of one reporter of one article.

&gt; that's clearly pervasive throughout our media

This is not something your example proves.

&gt;media of them being click baity, not insightful, and overall not making the people watching them any smarter or better informed.

Sure there is an incentive to drive viewership and this corrupts the process to a degree. This is the nature of capitalism in general goods and services created not to be the most effective, but to drive demand. Gimmicks, tropes, and brands, occasionally racketeering. But Mercedes still provide transport and luxury and IPhones still make calls and provide web access. CNN/BBC/Fox, or whatever your preferred fake news outlet, still informs. 

&gt;Add on top of this the fact that news orgs act as activists when it comes to politics and the distrust that has built up is deserved.

Yeah... no. The ones that try to be empirical are the ones that often get the most criticism, especially from your ilk.

&gt;No they don't. 

Yes, they do.

&gt;If I run an economic system that has an improvement from 7% growth to 10% growth for years, but has a hidden effect where you wipe out in year 12 then the net effect of that policy is bad.

I don't even know what to make of this example. Do you assume this ""hidden effect"" was intentional, or a matter of incompetence. Do you assume that the average Joe, you, would have a done a better job?

&gt;It's like a turkey that gets fed by humans every day instead of having to take care of itself. 

Wait is this suppose to be an allegory to the economy? Take care of itself?

&gt;People like Robert Rubin made 100s of millions sending our economy in the direction the turkey went and then paid none of it back when it blew up.

Ok.

&gt; It's fraud as far as I'm concerned.

Ok.

&gt;There is far too much entropy as our systems have gotten more complex and we are subject to too many random crazy events that lead to these models blowing up.
&gt;entropy

The value of methods is not measured on a binary perfect or not scale, but rather statistical effectiveness, and in some cases being better than a random guess. Decision making is almost never practical when it ties itself to a requirement of perfect information. If information or patterns is/are present, methodology and decision process can be employed, regardless of the noise level.

&gt;My prime example will be the huge assumption so many banks made about mortgages maintaining their 4% default rate in the run up to 2008. It only went up a few percentage points and would have collapsed our entire financial infrastructure if those losses weren't transferred onto the public.

You finally give an example of a macro level decision making process failure to prove how methodology of economics is flawed. Only to follow it up with a methodology prediction of your own.

&gt; It's obvious based on their results whether or not they're a fraud.

No, no, this is not obvious bad choice does not mean bad decision.

&gt;They have skin in the game with their predictions and if they lose all of their clients money they are rightfully pushed out of the system. if they lose all of their clients money they are rightfully pushed out of the system.

Sure tying the success of decision making process to the well being of the decision maker, provides a force against corruption. Sometimes it also creates disincentive to participate or offer your expertise.

&gt;This accountability is not pushed upon the Economics and Foreign Policy Establishments.

Accountability is pushed upon foreign policy experts and economist.

&gt;There are already clear standards here.

lol

&gt;Obviously sometimes procedures don't work, but to argue that doctors are consistently exempt from consequences in the same way economists are is wrong. 

This is not what I was arguing, although I more than happy to provide multitude of examples, of the medical community getting things wrong and not suffering the consequence. Rather the fact that medicine would not be today where it is at without the deaths of millions of people because of bad science, methodology, and ironically medical practice has gone through a significant amount of public criticism as a whole for precisely this.

&gt;It was an imperfect comparison, but the idea should be clear enough.

The idea that failure invalidates expertise, or the decision making process is stupid.

As far as accountability is concerned. That sounds like a good conversation to have. Preferably with an expert.

Also there are polls on popularity and he lands worst always and has a negative electorate of about 70-80 percent. His popularity is also very low at 10-20 percent, despite 30-50 percent popularity of PiS, so he is not popular even with people voting for PiS.

5656,"To clarify, other cities aren't losing out of tech jobs to Copenhagen but seem to be attractive too. Some are moving out of CPH to cut costs, (https://www.business.dk/foedevarer/milliardkoncern-flytter-hovedkvarter-med-200-job-fra-koebenhavn-til)

I still think Copenhagen is getting a lot of tech jobs, but, according to this (From 2017)
 (https://www.idag.dk/article/view/431941/tendens_nu_flytter_virksomhederne_vaek_fra_landets_storste_byer#) 3090 Companies have moved out of CPH, meanwhile 2425 have moved to Copenhagen. However, I still think CPH has loads of startups and doesn't have a trend, that suggest Tech Jobs flee the city. But the point I'm trying to make is, other cities in Denmark are not just farm-towns, but can compete, even on IT jobs. Eon-Reality for example, is going to Viborg with immediate start of 10 staff. Kanda in Århus is heavily expanding and many more. So of what tech news I bump into, a lot is happening in other cities and not just in Copenhagen.  That's my point. Not that CPH is losing jobs, but comparing the sizes, it seems other places in Denmark are able to still attract tech companies and jobs which I think is a good thing and which many Danes seem to forget, thinking everything happens in Copenhagen. 

(Also this does not include the Government jobs, that they decided had to go to the rest of the Country, for stupid reason, claiming it's ""outskirt"" Denmark, despite those cities don't even need those government jobs)

I don't find it hard to believe that what you said is the officially presented narrative of the story, but the truth to the matter is that you don't know the majority opinion since the majority was never asked their opinion. In fact the whole choice was never even given opportunity to be argued for. What you are saying is like arguing that every Swede wanted to host refugees since in a poll where the options were taking 100 thousand, half a million, or a million, all Swedes supported it. Or if green men showed up in Sweden, all Swedes supported joining the country of green men since everyone voted for it in a poll where options were joining now, in 90 days, or beginning of next year. If there's no real choices it's not a poll. Even if the public sentiment was approximately that before the propaganda poll was launched, all it really tells you is that ending nuclear energy quickly was falsely presented as the only option, which itself can now be concluded to be laughable.

I could charge it, but it could just no longer provide the power necessary to keep the PC alive, and I'd lose power the second I unplugged the battery.

I bring this up because the person you replied to referred to ""spontaneous reboots and power-downs"", something that a power bank would not help with.

How likely that is to occur? I have no idea. As I said before, I've never really had a smart phone long enough to know if this is actually a problem you can face. I've had batteries that run out very quickly, but none that just had my phone die and no longer work.

5828,"Thanks for pointing this out. The image Americans have of communism is really tiring. Even reading the communist manifesto (which is a pamphlet and a boring one, not an in depth explanation of anything) would be enough to explain that this understanding of communism is pretty ridiculous. If these people were actually communists they would occupy their workplace or start communaly owned buisnesses or advocate for nationalisation (depending on what kind of communists they are) but in any case if ""hate-speech"" would even be one of their concerns, it would be pretty low on their list and many of the most important figures in communism would oppose that jackshit alltogether. I mean here is what Marx had to say about free speech:

&gt; “Each form of freedom postulates the other in the same way as one limb of the body postulates another. Whenever one particular freedom is threatened, freedom itself is threatened. Freedom is always freedom, whether it is expressed in printers’ ink or in terms of land and possessions, in terms of conscience or in a political meeting”.

Rosa Luxembourg framed it even more clearly:

&gt; ""Freedom is always the freedom of dissenters""

But actually reading a book or even a single quote is way too slow tempo for the political climate in the US.

With unbridled national competition among the big powers, like in 19th century Europe, smaller nations will invariably get trampled under.

The German politician emphasized that it is necessary to create a ""good narrative"" around the discussion on the new multiannual financial framework. As he reminded, until now the axis of disputes in this case was who pays more to the EU budget than it draws (he is a net payer), and whoever draws more than it pays (it is a net beneficiary).
In his opinion, calculating how much tax revenue goes from one country to the EU budget, then to another Member State, is the worst narrative of what the EU is.
""This narrative is false, we are not a net contributor, in fact we are the biggest beneficiary of European integration, both economically and financially, certainly politically,"" he said referring to the situation of Germany.

Gabriel reminded that his homeland does not export its goods mainly to China or the United States, but in 60 percent. to the EU. He noted that this is possible only because the countries around Germany are doing well. ""No one depends on the welfare of other member states as much as Germany,"" he said, ""which is why I'm saying that we are not a net payer.""

The head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs stressed that as part of the debate on the new multiannual budget, one should consider how to spend funds for the right purposes. ""If it turns out that the resources at our disposal are insufficient, we must consider increasing them,"" he said.

He pointed out that the EU must create economic growth and jobs, as well as have means for possible crises. ""Whether it is for the euro zone or the EU27 only, in the next multiannual framework, funds must be defined to better manage future crises,"" he said. He added that the euro should not create north-south divisions, poor-rich, east-west divisions.

Gabiel stressed that the EU must also invest in Africa. ""We have become a longed-for place for many migrants to live in. We were not prepared for it when mass migration began,"" he admitted. He noted that the EU should have strong external borders, but at the same time must work with African countries to reduce migratory pressure.

""We should not leave Africa alone for the Chinese, China is investing there not because they are afraid of refugees, but in their own interest,"" stressed the German politician.

The foreign minister of Portugal, the newly elected head of the Eurogroup, Mario Centeno, who spoke after Gabriel, said that the decision on the EU budget to be about 1 percent. The gross national income of the Member States should be considered.

Centeno pointed out that Britain's exit from the EU would affect the new multiannual financial framework. ""Either we ask for higher payments from the Member States, or we will have to establish new own resources"" - he stressed.

In his opinion, the EU budget should be fed with influences that are combined with shared competences between the EU and its member states. In this context, he mentioned customs tariffs, environmental and transport fees, or a part of VAT revenues.

5974,"&gt; How do you think they started believing that Merkel invited them? Out of thin air? It's okay if you find it irrelevant, but migrants don't.

In many cases, the human traffickers spread these lies to improve their business. And it is possible that Merkel should have chosen her words more carefully (as I wrote in the linked post), but the refugee momevents started long before she publicly lost a word on this. Any talk of an ""invitation"" is irrelevant therefore. 

&gt; If that was the unified approach, then there was no approach at all. Attempting to have one is good, but I doubt they thought it would work. I have no idea if the Turkey deal was a unified approach, but we should have done that from the very start. It worked.

Sorry for the late reply, took me a little while to get my google-fu up and running (apprently googling for ""r/europe"" is equivalent to googling 'r europe' instead you need to use the advanced search form). 

Here's a [Gawker article](http://gawker.com/reddit-is-so-racist-white-supremacists-are-using-it-to-1691162974) and if you google further you will find plenty of mentions on r/europe and r/europemeta itself. At the time when these articles surfaced I absolutely remember there being much more toxicity on r/europe than there is now; I hardly ever came here because the board was used too much (in my opinion) to complain about refugees (this was at the start of the refugee crisis I remember). 

As I mention in a different post here in this thread; it's hardly ever possible to unmask a good troll as being actually a nazi (or affiliated with any political denomination, for that matter) so the evidence is admittedly rather weak. However if you work your way through search results you will see that this was a sentiment shared by many (though not all) and that mods became aware of potential nazi brigading as well.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/7o02fb/white_working_class_boys_left_behind_because_of/dseq961/,Tortenkopf,1515485408
