Androgynous people are people who have facial characteristics or body traits resembling the other gender.  
For example women with broad, sharp-angled jaws or men with pointed chins and a soft face contour.  
These traits varies from aspects that are commonly found in one of the sexes (such as bone structure) to aspects that are socially manufactured (such as short haircuts or suits). This is what ""genderfluidity"" would pertain to.

Intersex people on the other hand have no ""socially manufactured"" aspect to them, its nothing about the looks, the way they dress, their mannerisms, how deep or soft their voice is, how they talk, etc.

The biggest draw for HBO in the US (it's always been $15+ per month) were it's movies and the best porn out there and lots of it called After Dark. HBO has been around for a very long time, it's not new like Netflix. 

&amp;#x200B;

How it used to be is you'd have I believe about 5 different HBO channels all under one sub. One or two of those channels would show porn. This way with early 90's technology you could block those channels with a pin code on your actual TV set so Johnny couldn't sneak in the livingroom at night at wack off to two dudes double penetration some chick. They'd even have ethnic porn or mixed race porn way back then which was seen basically like Star Trek as shocking/groundbreaking in television. 

&amp;#x200B;

Game of Thrones was there way of bringing families together, a lot less sex, a lot more torture and physiological mindfucks. So no more straightup porn.. but yeah that's why seeing the sex scenes you do on HBO isn't remotely shocking or edgy to them unlike 95% of all other channels in the world. They seem to really love torture though. I'm going to take a wild guess and say HBO HQ has a dungeon with a German dominatrix on standby.

139,"The left-wing case against the European Union is absolutely clear-cut.

1. The European Union is a capitalist institution, a sort of trading bloc. It resemble something like the Hanseatic League. It started when the ruling business elites of Germany and France realized, after many years of slaughtering each other, that they could more effectively guarantee profits in their respective countries by co-operation. Other countries joined on the same principle. 

 You have to have a functioning market economy to join the European Union and it is against the rules to limit market competition by performing such socialistic actions as nationalising railways. 

 The European Union is essentially a way for the ruling capitalist classes in each European country to co-operate the better to ensure a steady rate of profits for themselves, and to keep out competitors, and, not coincidentally, to facilitate the exploitation of European workers through the neo-liberal prinicple of ""free movement of labour"", whereby workers from poor parts of Europe can be moved to rich parts of Europe (usually east to west) in order to perform the lowest status jobs, which leads inevitably to a race to the bottom in terms of wages and conditions. 

2. The European Union is undemocratic. The right-wingers are actually correct about this. The various European peoples have simply not developed a consciousness of Europe as one place politically, at least in terms of elections, and the European elections are supererogatory to the national elections and often ignored. Many commissioners and officials are appointed rather than elected, so the democratic deficit becomes larger and larger. 

 The theme for Europe ought to be decentralisation, not centralisation of power in Brussels or anywhere else. Even London seems to far away to me, and I don't particularly like the conglomeration of power there. 

 I am not opposed to the idea of European federalism or closer European integration. On the contrary, I think it's a good idea. But if Europe is to be one place,  it won't be a fucking capitalist commercial shopping mall EU. It will be a sort of  emotional and spiritual federation of peoples. It will be another Renaissance, another Enlightenment, and a new Christendom. It will be a realization at last of the dreams of the Greeks of Athens and the Communards of Paris.",Scotland,/r/europe/comments/bsa9np/there_is_no_sane_or_benefic_reason_to_oppose_the/eokzw7b/,michaelnoir,1558663896

Wait, that's the fencing that has already been mentioned by the Washington Post in the first place. I addressed that in my previous post. The photo posted on The_Donald looked more like an actual concrete barrier, hence my skepticism as to whether that picture might have been taken elsewhere.

And none of the [prototypes](https://ul.countable.us/ul/q_auto/uploads/gZAMg8wZ/4121cc/large_61991-1520967065.jpg) looks like that. This fencing appears [exactly the same as the old ones](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/hires/02152012_2_02152012_2b_hires.jpg).

&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States

&gt; Yes.

What does *national debt* have to do with *private trade*? Am I missing something here? The USA are not a communist country, after all, so the trade its companies and citizens engage in should not have any effect on the national accounts.

If you'd like the US to reduce its debt, I'd advocate fixing the budget, such as by reducing the [ridiculously inflated military budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures).

&gt; Each word is a link again, and yes, I'm using newsbusters again for that last link as the Covington Kids false allegations are old news by now- I'd be surprised if much of Europe hadn't heard of it, considering Poland invited the kids over for a tour of the place. Blatant bias and death threats because a kid wears a MAGA hat. It's sickening.

You're criticizing good journalism here. Every paper has to make a call as to whether or not to run a story based on the amount of evidence submitted, and video material is much better proof than just a person's word.

I still don't think these kids were innocent, by the way. You can't argue the MAGA hat is not a political declaration, being affiliated with a specific politician and his agenda, and the facial expression on the tapes and the nature of their gestures looked obvious to me. But we may have to agree to disagree on this.

Still, I think you should give [the original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/picture-of-the-conflict-on-the-mall-comes-into-clearer-focus/2019/01/20/c078f092-1ceb-11e9-9145-3f74070bbdb9_story.html) a try and read the account in its entirety, including watching the video footage, instead of consuming everything through the filter of a website that does not even hide its bias. It also explains how the situation could even devolve that far, if you were unaware that there were more than two parties involved.

&gt; Examples being the coverage of Sri Lanka terrorist attacks, news coverage without named sources, hypocritical obstructionism (media + democrats resisted Trump on building a wall despite supporting a wall under Obama), the inability of female democratic representatives to stand up for anything but themselves during SOTU addresses

I've seen plenty of Sri Lanka coverage on the WaPo, and the use of anonymous sources has been an integral part of journalism since forever. Likewise, don't you think Trump's wall plans differed a bit from those of the Obama administration?

&gt; There's little point in trying to figure out which are extremists when it's really just a batch issue.

By the same logic we should just ban Christianity. But I guess that would now constitute ""militant atheism"", since it would not be limited against Muslims or Jews.

&gt; In short, a baby that survives abortion is not entitled to immediate aid (or any aid whatsoever) by hospital staff. No one is required to insure the safety of the mother or child in this event, and the baby can be left aside to die if the mother elects to carry through with her abortion.

But US law specifies a born-alive infant as a child and human being, as per [Public Law 107-207](https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ207/PLAW-107publ207.pdf), aka the ""Born Alive Act"". Don't the United States also have a law requiring people to help a person in need? In other words, why would the State of NY require a separate bill for this?

&gt; Can the UK defend itself against its government? No.

As much as the US. In any rebellion against your own government, you either get the military on your side, or you will fail.

But just for the sake of argument: if you presuppose the peoples' ability to stage a revolution, wouldn't that ultimately just mean the government is inherently vulnerable to whoever has the most guns? As in ""might makes right?"" Would be even more dangerous.

&gt; Look at how Venezuela turned out. I'd say next to none, if none at all, of those civilians had a means to resist Maduro's regime. Same thing with China when the Tiananmen square incident occurred.

There's plenty of guns in Venezuela; there was no gun control until 2012. The problem is firearms would be mostly held by the colectivos, which are essentially armed gangs - Venezuela's local version of the mafia - but allied with and doing the government's dirty work. The Venezuelan revolution seems to fail because the military unfortunately didn't switch sides. Maybe a miracle will still happen, but I'm not holding my breath.

You've got more of an argument with China, although we have to remember those were students, engaged in the heat of the moment. The people gunned down by the US National Guard at Kent State or the South Carolina Highway Patrol at Orangeburg didn't have guns either, and they could have. I'm pretty sure neither side had expected the June 4th Incident to end up like it did, but that it escalated over the course of the day. Somewhat similar to the Chicago Riots, but of course different in scope.

&gt; Now, do you need Islamic terrorism to combat your government? Do you need it to enforce the law? Do you need it to ensure your rights as a free people?

Also, why would a fake news ban forbid people from speaking? Running a private blog is quite different from posing as a legit news institution.

201,"&gt;But they are in the GUE/NGL (so European Left) with leftist parties that are pro EU?

GUE/NGL parties aren't pro-EU. Left-wing parties in Europe have always been pushing back against the EU because (and this is especially true for the economically weaker countries) the EU has always pushed for further privatization and for further liberalization of the economy. This puts worker's rights in danger and skews the economy even further in favor of the capitalist class.

Their Euroscepticism is significantly different than the one that (far) right-wing parties espouse. The euroscepticism of right-wing parties is based on the fact that right-wing parties are nationalist while the EU is a transnational project. In other words, right-wing eurosceptics are opposed to the EU at its very core.

Left-wing eurosceptics, on the other hand, aren't opposed in the transnational nature of the EU. Almost all of them are internationalist parties so they are totally fine with that. What they oppose is the EU's economic policy. They view it (and rightfully so, in my opinion) as a vehicle that further pushes for neoliberal economic policies and aims to destroy (or at least significantly curtail) worker's rights across the continent.

225,"* In the Netherlands you must register in the municipal register* when moving to that municipality. Come election time, a voting pass is sent to your address, one per eligble voter.    
* A couple of days later the candidates list comes in (one per address). It [shows](https://images1.persgroep.net/rcs/G9eSfhudm5Y37mXcQM8j-BX82xs/diocontent/143072541/_fill/1200/900/?appId=21791a8992982cd8da851550a453bd7f&amp;quality=0.9) all your voting options. You vote for members. The members are all part of a party (also dubbed a 'list', because they are listed together). One man parties are possible. So if you want to vote for the party but don't care who ends up in parliament, you can just vote for the party leader which will be on number 1. If for some reason a lot of people end up voting for the member on number 10 (maybe because she's a woman, maybe because you like her stances or maybe because she's from your area) and the party eventually gets 9 seats in parliament, preferrential votes come into play and number 10 will be able to enter parliament if enough preferrential votes are given. 
* Want to end up on the list and form your own party? All you have to do is establish your own political party at your notary. Register it at the chamber of commerce. Raise enough signatures and pay ‚Ç¨450 registration costs to the electoral council. A party name is technically not necessary, as you can refer to the numbered 'list'.
* On election day, you can vote from 0 am (some places, most locations open at 7am) until 9pm. You can go to any polling place in your municipality. If you want to be able to vote anywhere in the country, you have to request a special pass 5 days in advance.   
* You enter the polling place. There's multiple in each neighbourhood ([here's a map](https://waarismijnstemlokaal.nl/)). Usually in community centers or schools. There's temporary signs in the immediate area pointing towards one. You show your ID (passport, ID card, drivers license, residency permit?). It should match the personal data on your voting pass. The person in the polling place inspects both. Your voting pass is taken an you get a ballot paper.    
* You take the ballot paper to a cubicle. It is not allowed to assist someone in the cubicle. You can take a selfie of yourself voting. You can't try to sneak on others while they're voting.   
* In the cubicle there's a red pencil. You fold open the ballot paper and colour in the circle in front of the candidate of your choosing. Multiple selections or pencil marks outside of 1 circle makes the ballot invalid. You can also decide to not mark anything and vote blank. When there's more than one election, you get a ballot paper for each. You fold the ballot paper back (which is difficult as the thing is quite large. They're proposing a new design now) and put it into a voting bin.
* The votes get counted. That night exit polls are reveiled. The actual result will take 1 or 2 days.    
* Seats in parliament are proportional to the percentage of votes. Blank votes are counted in a special way (and go to the biggest party or something). Some parties might get 1 seat. No party has ever gotten a majority. Each vote counts the same. Currently there are 13 parties in parliament, covering the whole political spectrum.   
* The leader of the largest party is slated to become prime minister. This is no set rule however, the party can nominate people to be prime minister and ministers.    
* The largest party appoints a formateur (usually someone who is somewhat independent, usually not politically active anymore) who investigates what options there are to form a coalition with the other parties, to form a majority. A majority consists of 1 seat more than half all the seats in Parliament (76 seats of 150). To reign parliament, parties will have to make compromises and deals with the other party(s) so that they'll want to work together. If negotiations with all parties fail and a majority is deemed not possible, the second largest party will appoint a formateur of their own.   
* If a coalition is agreed, the formateur goes to the King and reports a new cabinet has been agreed on. The King will then install the new cabinet.   
* As you vote primarily for members and not parties, a member will keep its seat if it breaks away from the party, until the next elections.


No gerrymandered voting districts, no electoral college, no two party system, no pre-registering for a party, no caucus, no arbitrary electoral threshold, no hour long lines.

*This municipal register makes it so a lot of governmental or healthcare organizations are given your basic data automatically.

It will fail for the very same reasons as history has demonstrated time and time again. It will become increasingly hard to feel patriotic towards this monolith, when whilst all-encompassing it will remain totally remote from your concerns.

I am patriotic to a point. I like many Brits have no greater scorn for any country than my own at times. They are things I can be proud of and things I am ashamed of.

278,"&gt;The CU is much more left wing than the CDU, especially on issues like refugees but also welfare programs for example.

Obviously. As I said above, CDU borrows heavily from liberal conservatism which makes them centre-right. CU doesn't do that. They are much more solidly Christian Democratic than CDU is which is why I compared them with Aldo Moro's Christian Democracy.

&gt;Give that I wrote this with an international audience in mind I stand by my description.

The term ""left-wing"" is usually used for socialist and communist parties. There is a reason why the term centre-left exists. It is to include those who are to the left of centre but aren't socialists or communists (usually social democrats, social liberals and greens). Christian democracy as an ideology usually falls to the right of social democracy but to the left of liberal conservatism. Therefore, the more accurate definition for them would be Centrist. There is a reason why the political international for Christian Democratic parties is called Centrist Democrat International. They identify as Centrists. Centre-left would be pushing it, imo, but I could see why you'd view them as such. Left-wing just sounds inaccurate to me.

&gt;I also find it unlikely people would assume there's an Eastern Orthodox Christianity party in the Netherlands, and fundamentalist doesn't do them justice. Given that one of the meanings of Orthodox describes them perfectly and the risk of confusion should be low I feel that description is fine as well.

Those are BMG polls. Mine are Panelbase polls. Mystery solved.

&gt;Seems to ignore that aligning the left to remain in the EU, also puts it in a political coalition with free-market Tories, big business and people advocating for lower wages and worse conditions for workers.

Yes, but the Labour could also leave the S&amp;D group and join the GUE/NGL group if they wanted to. The Labour is quite a strong party in the EP, so they can actually have an influence.

On the other hand, you seem to ignore that the UK is one of the most neo-liberal countries in Europe. I've been living in London for 1.5y now and, while I really like it, I think this country is the most individualist place I've ever seen.

327,"You're overestimating the Austrian Greens and the significance of our green president 

Our federal president van der Bellen once used to be the leader of the Green party, but he wasn't really elected for his green positions. Similar to Germany federal president doesn't really have a lot of power in Austria (however he directly elected), but in situations like our current Ibiza-induced government crisis (the worst crisis since 1945, we have had a lot of ""first times"" in the last days) he has a very important stabilizing role. VdB is doing a great job at the moment, in my opinion. Basically he was elected because he is a grandfatherly, well-educated  (uni prof for macro-economics), intelligent and well spoken elder statesman. During his years as active parliamentarian he was one of the most popular and well respected politicians in the country, more than the rest of his party. So his presidency is not really an indicator for the popularity of the Greens. 

Also, the alternative in the presidental elections was a super duper right wing wolf in a sheep's pelt from ibiza-FP√ñ. 

We had parliamentary elections like half a year after VdB was elected. The Greens got like 3% and dropped out of parliament. They hadn't been doing well the years before, due to a number of reasons, mostly their own fault. Now after having some time to reorganize their base and finding back to their roots, hopefully they'll make it to the EU parliament and can transform that energy to make a comeback to our national parliament in the snap elections next September.

&gt;Do you trust the combustion engine? anything electrical? anything electrical with a timer? would you trust a self driving car? i bet you use facebook and google, daily. E-voting sounds like the strangest place to draw a line, don't you think?

You couldn't know this but I'm a software engineer by trade. Which is exactly why I don't trust electronic voting systems. People who actually understand these systems are almost always skeptical (if they're not, they have something to sell).

I don't use Facebook at all and I minimise my usage of Google.

&gt;And what exactly gives you confidence that your paper vote goes to the right place? Not a damn thing. 

In the past I have also volunteered as a poll worker. The counting of the ballots is done in public, everyone who wishes to do so is welcome and encouraged to come witness the process. But votes that are only stored as bits and bytes in a system could never be verified by the public. Paper ballots can also be recounted easily if necessary.

Besides, the Netherlands as a country is reasonably non-corrupt. For bad actors to have an noticeable effect in the election results through fraud with paper ballots they would need the cooperation of many people in quite a logistically complex operation such that it could never remain a secret here. With electronic voting you'd just need one person with access to the relevant systems to rewrite the results.

Voting at home on your computer or phone also makes people vulnerable to coercion. For example a person could be looking over their spouse's shoulder to make sure they make the ""right"" choice. At the voting booths we send such people outside.

These are just some of the reasons that electronic voting is banned here. Voting machines were in use until some years ago, but after some good public debate it was decided to end that.

In Virginia, for example, people vote every year: every 2 even years for the federal level and every odd year for the state level. To that, you also need to add local elections (which vary from place to place) and, depending on the state, the election of state judges and sheriffs.

420,"&gt;That said, for the sake of intellectual honesty I have to admit that most Europeanist criticisms of EU institutions, representatives, and political agenda are typically not very forceful. Their objections to the status quo are often quite shy and submissive, as if they were afraid of challenging the EU‚Äôs aura of inscrutable benevolence‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat rooted idea that EU institutions know what‚Äôs better for the people, and therefore their decisions can‚Äôt really be questioned. On the contrary, criticism from the Eurosceptic front is quickly dismissed as exaggerated, subversive and often based on fake news or even conspiracy theories. In a nutshell: unfounded.

This is very insightful and hits the nail on the head.  They won't criticize because they know how fragile the EU is and how easily destroyed it can be by accurate criticism.  

I like that phrase, ""aura of inscrutable benevolence"".  The EU is always best, even when it's wrong, and we mustn't tell our betters how to rule us as we don't have their expertise.

432,"It's not demonising or trivializing anything... it's LITERALLY what they are. What you're doing is just a typical way in which modern fascists try to hide what they are; by trying to make those of us who point it out seem ridiculous by creating a strawman argument; as if we were comparing you to the nazi party of 1940, instead of the nazi party of 1920. 

Baudet and the FvD hit most of the definitions of fascism as have been established by scholars over the decades. Key definitional aspects of fascists that Baudet and the FvD fit *perfectly* include:

* Rejection of modernism / obsession with some perceived moral decline.
* Obsession with being victims or humiliated. 
* Authoritarian.
* Attacks on modern science and culture.
* Fear of Difference, manifesting in appeals/racism against foreigners and minorities.
* Illiberalism.
* Obsession with conspiracies and plots; creating enemies that were never there.
* Simultaneously characterizing the forces they oppose as both too weak, and too strong.
* Misogyny stemming from an overly macho ethos.
* Selective Populism; pretending like they represent the Will of the People, while delegitimizing democratic groups and institutions that disagree with them.
* Ample use of newspeak.
* Appeals to mythical/historic age of glory/heroism.

I could go on a bit more.

Baudet and the FvD hit all of these points. If it was just one or two points, you'd have an argument... but when they hit pretty much EVERY definition of fascists...

Why wouldn't it? The service that YouTube provides is just a hosting service. It doesn't spend a lot of mony on improving its user interface. Since YouTube has been replacing TV for a lot of people, advertisers are switching to YouTube. In fact more money is spent on internet advertisement than on print and TV media advertisement. It's a huge business.

465,"&gt; Which public subsidies would you cut? I agree that more should be done for public housing, though.

I'd like to have an office inside INE/BDE/CIS (this three branches coordinated) to measure the impact of every policy. Then take action. My educated guess is that most subsidies have very poor performance for each euro spent. 

I'd cut probably all of them except retirement pensions, unemployment and a few more thought for extreme situations.

In the case of subsidies for companies is more complicated, but I'd probably cut many of those aimed for the internal market.

&gt; While on the long term we need to reduce the debt, I think in the short term we also need to start patching the social damage caused by the crisis, which has not been little. Otherwise, the citizen's faith in democracy and our system of government will decay, quickly. The social contract has been broken and it needs amendment. We rescued the banks, at the expense of many citizens' welfare, and now we have to give that back to the citizens.

The reality is that the down cycle is very close, and we are still at d√©ficit, and we raised the current expenditure. We are just living an illusion. We won't have any saving as the PP had for the last down cycle. I don't really need to explain what will be the consequences of that, but people will suffer, and if the cycle is as long as the 2008 was, then the situation will be dramatic.

&gt; Yes, I agree. But Vox's ""solution"" is terrible, and would only further inequality and leave many pensioners in poverty.

There's no good solution for the public pensions problem. It's too late. We had so many time to reform the system, but now we are 10y ahead of the bulk joining the system. There will be no money to pay for it. It doesn't matter how much they rise the taxes.

Every time? I see.

&gt; So if we don't resist now, it could become the norm to create/cast mediocre or even ugly characters/actresses in games/movies. 

You look at the entertainment industry and you think that there is real danger of having no pretty women in entertainment anymore? Bizarre.

How are you fighting back? Making comments on the internet about how there are not enough pretty women in videogames? Do you have any idea how that sounds? This won't convince anyone.

506,"&gt;	Easy to say for a westerner who makes a month what an average person in the world makes a year, who lives in safe environment, can afford to travel around the world and doesn't have to be afraid of diseases or hunger most of the world population is still affected by. Yeah, you can easily follow the 'zero growth' policy because you already have everything.


You can have sustainable growth, If we westerner didn‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt mean that others have to do our same errors. 

&gt;	I don't. I simply say it's pointless to do anything in Europe

And it‚Äôs objectively not true, Europe could have a significant impact 

&gt;	if the biggest polluters don't cut their emissions as much

We literally are the biggest polluters.
The EU is the third in the world, after China and the US. And China produces most of the shit we buy 

&gt;	How can the continent whose share of global CO2 emissions amounts to around 10% change anything?

508,"You can piggyback on existing EU regulation that you agree with and create your own regulations where we feel it is needed. And you don't need to regulate everything. You share EU regulations with Single Market countries and either copy or make our own regulation for products coming from outside the Single Market.

You can lower your own trade barriers unilaterally if you want, you don't need to have all those separate trade agreements with lots of different countries. 

It's in the best interest of the EU to continue trading with us and to keep a friendly relationship well into the future. Just because we would be leaving does not mean there would be hard feelings about it. 

&gt; Whereby we lose any and all say (including probably about corporate taxes, cause why the not the other 26 not target those juicy jobs/revenue). 

I'm not sure what you mean by this. Why would we lose say over or corporate taxation policy?

When you have a decent economy providing high quality goods and services you don't need to be in the EU to get a foot in the door with other countries. Plenty of countries get along just fine on their own, like Israel, Canada, India, Singapore, South Korea.

We don't need loads and loads of bureaucratic institutions. Especially because we're a mid-sized country, not that much to regulate anyway. Why would we need our own satellite system, for example?

&gt; We will lose our ability to travel and work freely in 26 OECD nations 

Would we, though? Can't you already travel to countries outside of the Schengen zone freely? Waiting a couple of minutes at customs at the airport is not going to kill you.

&gt; ""clever customs checking"" what? empty tripe without any regard for the real world practical applications. 

Plenty of cargo from outside the EU is already coming in at our harbors and airports without us having to check the cargo when it arrives.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, the ECB negative interest policy is vapourising our pensions just to keep southern european banks standing even though they should just let them blow if they are not capable of taking care of their own business. 

  
I would like to make a counterpoint to your comment. A Nexit does not have to happen if the EU would just be scaled back and would allow us to make bilateral agreements on our own, if we didn't have to accept a part of every migrant wave simply because other countries can't keep their borders tightened and if we did not have to pay for southern european states and banks with low interest rates on the Euro just because those countries would otherwise default on their debts.

The Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit that runs the online encyclopedia, said it had filed an application to the European Court of Human Rights on the grounds that a blanket ban was a violation of the fundamental right to freedom of expression.

Announcing the move on Thursday, Katherine Maher, the chief executive of Wikimedia, said the decision to turn to the Strasbourg-based court followed two years of discussions with Turkish authorities and a fruitless challenge in the country‚Äôs highest court.

Assuming that people become gay and aren't born like that, exposing children to gays may lead to these children having higher chance of becoming gays as well because, as I said, there's a theory which claims that a child's environment can affect his sexual orientation

Wouldn't you prefer having attractive characters in a video game you play rather than unattractive ones?

Ugly/attractive may be subjective in some cases, but overall there're beauty standarts that the majority of people agree on. If a person is objectively attractive, he/she would look attractive to almost everyone. If a person is objectively ugly, he/she would look ugly to almost everyone.

618,"Some context here because the situation in the Netherlands is slightly peculiar. The Netherlands have their own natural gas production. Of course every Dutch household heats and cooks on gas. Gas production also brought billions of revenues into the country but the issue is now that pumping up gas results in small earthquakes which cause damage to property in the Northern province. The gov‚Äôt has therefore decided to gradually phase out gas production by 2030

While several countries in Europe (and also China for instance) see natural gas as a relatively environmentally sound intermediate energy solution while renewables are fully developed, the Dutch government has taken a very hard line decision to not transition to foreign gas suppliers but phase out gas completely and by force. 

This means that all households will have to change to heat-pumps for heating in relatively short order. Holland is full of lovingly restored old houses and heritage. Beautiful buildings, but old and hence badly insulated. House owners fear they will face significant expenditure in transitioning to heat-pumps and complete overhaul of old homes in the insulation department + additional cost for solar panels. Capitalizing on this fear is one of the spear points of Baudet‚Äôs campaign.

647,"&gt;It's still a major player but it can lose its position, surpassed by new emerging big economies like India.

Sure, and?


&gt;Still we will be affected by their impact on climate.

Sure, they are and they will be affected much more by ours.


&gt;Impossible to control and check. And it's already too late, Asia doesn't really need Europe anymore. It's a big market on its own - if Europe doesn't buy from them, they will sell their stuff between each other yet their emissions and pollution will hit Europe as well.


Saying that Asia doesn't need Europe anymore is objectively wrong again. Europe remains the richest market in the world.

China would collapse in a couple of days if Europe and the US banned all their imports from China.


&gt;I'm not against 'starting doing something' but self-imposed limits won't change anything if other countries don't follow this way. If there's anything we can do - this is just a worldwide agreement. But since it's obvious emerging economies won't obey the rules (and I understand them - Europe didn't care about climate during its industrial revolution and it only started to care when it already got rich, so bashing other countries for striving for their own industrial revolution now is kinda hypocritical) it doesn't make sense.

Your argument doesn't make sense, if you are not against 'starting doing something'  then stop complaining when we do. We are EU citizens, of course, we should care more about the EU than the rest of the world. Also because I don't have a say on what's going on in China, but I do in the EU


&gt;The only thing Europe can achieve by making a unilateral decision to lower CO2 emissions is loss of its global importance and influence so countries like China or India will stop respecting Europe and listening to its words even more.

No, why the fuck China and India would stop listening to us if we put some environmental protection laws? Also China started taking the environment more seriously lately, it's going to do better. If we do our part we will also be less hypocritical when we ask them to do their part.

&gt;Care to explain?

The decline of Europe began with the 2 World wars and has next to nothing to do with environmental regulation, obviously.

The excessive role we attribute to the economy is the reason we are facing the sixth world extinction. 


&gt;I never denied it, what I say is that Europe can neither stop climate change alone nor force other countries to do anything.

Of course, literally nobody ever said that.

&gt;Btw, you have probably a different perspective as an Italian than me, as a Pole, because various studies say southern Europe will suffer from climate change the most, while Eastern/North-Eastern Europe can even benefit from it or it won't be really harmful:

I just mentioned Asia and Africa as 2 continents that won't obey the rules. While NOW Africa is not yet relevant, it will grow in the future.

&gt;China has almost 3 times the EU populayion.
&gt;Again, India has 2 times EU population

It only supports my point of view - Europe is getting more and more irrelevant and no change here will have a tremendous effect on climate - simply because Europe is already quite small, both population- and economy-wise and its relevance will only decrease in next decades. 

&gt;Another good reason to properly fight climate change

You seem not to understand me I see. How many times do I need to repeat that I'm not opposing the fight against climate change itself, just the way how it is done (so basically Europe carries the burden while China or India, that together produce about 4 times more CO2 than Europe don't really care)? It only makes sense if everyone in the world join it. If not - Europe won't change anything.

&gt;Objectively wrong and stupid.

Thanks for your and convincing reasoning and arguments. One more time - Europe produces only around 20-30% of CO2 China&amp;India produce, and China and India still grow much faster than Europe lowers its emission. And it's only China and India, while all of Africa produces a lot too - not as much but still.

There were many horrible things throughout history that were considered normal

It shouldn't be ""not many"", it should be ""nobody at all"". This practice is the definition of child abuse, but for some reason it's not punishable in the ""progressive"" west for now.

&gt;You say ""Gay characters are being added to kids cartoons"" as if the existence of a gay character in itself is bad

It is still being debated whether gays are born that way or they become gays during their childhood/teenage years. And there's still no 100% answer. And if it turns out that a child's environment (including cartoons) can affect his/her sexual orientation, then you know what it means to have gay characters in cartoons and exposing children to gays.

&gt;And ""ugly female characters""? What are you, a walking Gamer(tm) stereotype?

If a ""gamer stereotype"" means a normal dude who wants to see attractive people in games and movies instead of ugly ones, then yes, I am. Ugliness is a negative side of reality, and there's absolutly no reason to transfer this side into the fantasy world of entertainment.

Politicians in this country have a job like any other, i dont think it should be like so but anyways. I say politicians the same way i could say engeneers or librarians or whatever. I do think they do their job poorly in many ways, i dont blame them 100% for it, our society is very divided, but they base their campaigns in fake promisses, fake statistics, pedagogy and attacking each other rather than actually saying what they want and what they will give to this country. Whenever they got in front of a camera all they did was shit talking about the other parties. The pacts that they are planning are based purely on their intention to get into the gobernment at all cost, wich is a big root of the problems in catalonia and vasque country, they used to get a lot of money now they want more, wich is horrible taking into account that they are the richest parts of spain with madrid. 
I also think spanish people are in general very shelfish but im sure you cant blame corruption on that.
And most important of all, WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE VOTED THE PARTY THEY DISLIKED THE LEAST, most of the people dont actually like anyone, last elections we couldnt decide in 3 elections i think.

968,"Fun fact, George Cottrell shared an office with Scot Young, the Russian money launderer who ""fell out of a window"" in a ""suicide"".

Young was apparently Cottrell's mentor and the two were regular fixtures at Scott‚Äôs restaurant, which they nonchalantly referred to as the ‚Äúcafeteria‚Äù given its proximity to their office, and at Boujis nightclub in South Kensington near Cottrell‚Äôs residence.

Starting in late 2012 Cottrell based himself out of an office located at 44 Hertford Street, the same building which accommodated Scot Young‚Äôs office. The peculiar arrangement was located on two upper floors, meanwhile the ground floor setup involved an airport-style metal detector for a short while allegedly to ‚Äúscreen contractors.‚Äù

Out of Scot Young's group of money launderers, russian connected ""bankers"", and ""businessmen"" based in London, most are now dead.

https://georgecottrell.wordpress.com/tag/scot-young/

Paul castle - Dead

 Johnny Elichaoff Dead - ""fell off a roof in West London""
 Boris Berezovsky - ""hung himelf with his own tie""
Stephen Curtis (worked for Russian oligarchs) - ""helicopter crash"" 
 Robert Curtis - ""fell in front of a London tube train in 2012
Stephen Moss - ""heart attack""

Given that Cottrell's extended list of associates and his mentor all happened to either fall out of windows or in front of trains, perhaps he should be careful.

Also another fun fact, Andy Wigmore, Arron banks' sidekick and Leave . EU PR man, sent the Russian embassy Cottrell's FBI documents with the heading ""Have fun with this!"".

but... No they **cannot**. If there is no wind, or no sun (or in the winter), you just can't turn them on! But you actually said it:

Yes, they can't be turned on all the time. So they can't be turned on on demand.

3) South Ossetia has been problematic, and things haven't started with Georgia attacking in 2008. And no, it's not a normal place either, but it continues to eat up more lands since their border literally moves in time by time.

Did we really forget this happened?  It was one of the defining moments of the citizen journalism movement.  Back before Facebook/Twitter/Youtube started censoring.  

The German police did their best to cover it up.  

&gt;The events ‚Äúhad been overcast by the perception that asylum-seekers were a part of these mobs,‚Äù said Gage-Lindner, of the DJB.

&gt;That the perpetrators on New Year‚Äôs Eve were foreigners ‚Äî not European foreigners, but dark-skinned men who have nothing more in common than the assumption that they were somehow Arab ‚Äî has fed a primal fear: that no one is protecting ""our women,"" who are now, clearly, at risk from ""them.""

These companies were not only around. They raised Nazis to power pushed to war and profited from war, they took over whole competition in occupied countries, caused death of engineers and scientist there, enslaved and worked often to death millions of workers.

Finland had chances Poland never got, first Germans didn‚Äôt exterminate or enslave your people and didn‚Äôt plunder your country, then Russians, they took land from you, but did not occupy or plunder you for decades. I assure you that if Poland was free from 1945 albeit devastated and crippled we would achieve similar results as you and probably there would be no talk of reparations.

I'm not sure what exactly was different in those years that allowed such estimations to be made and while I'm far for being an expert it's pretty sure a statistical error (my bet is that it was a misunderstanding generated from the local government);

However, the closest value I could find in our local statistics is **25.4% ( Relative at-risk-of-poverty rate )** for 2015, which means the entire year they won less then 6172 RON (1364‚Ç¨ or 1488$ -- at 2015 exchange rate)...

1245,"The Nibelungenlied is an *epic*, but there's nothing particularly *national* about it. Kriemhild is from France; Br√ºnhild is from Iceland. 

As distinguished from the Song of Roland, which really is a national epic because its major theme is ""the sweet land of France"". It is about *France* as a country. 

&gt;You Americans always seem to miss the point that European nations didn't just pop up two centuries ago.

And you seem to be particularly illiterate when it comes to actually knowing something about what these epics are about. 

&gt;Because the people at the time thought that the story had something to say about them.

But the same is true of *Tristan and Isolde* and - probably the most popular German medieval epic - *Parzival*. Even though Tristan and Isolde takes place in England and Ireland, and Parzival is about an English knight. 

Beowulf doesn't even take place in England; he's a Geat, and they live in Sweden, where the story seems to take place. It's even less of a candidate than the Nibelungenlied, as Beowulf was unknown for hundreds of years until a manuscript was discovered; the Nibelungenlied is preserved in lots of manuscripts and was never lost.

1254,"&gt; Renewable+Nuclear makes the most sense to me.

There is a reason that Greens are against it, and it is not that they are more stupid than the average redditor.

Renewable+Nuclear makes no sense at all. It is not a question at all that we can build enough renewable capacity to generate all elictricity that we need. It would also be cheaper if you consider the long term costs, etc. The only thing that is still not 100% solved is how to best store energy in times with more sun+wind than needed to use it in times of less sun+wind.

In the short/medium term you need a form of energy that can be inceased and decreased fast. This is not possible with nuclear. Nucear only works good to supply a constant or almost constant supply of electricty. In that regard it works against the renewables.

Storage becomes less of a problem once you have a large powerful continental electricty grid, because on a large continent there is almost always wind somewhere. But you will still have fluctuations which are easiest resolved with natural gas. Compared with other fossil fuels, this is the most CO2 and other pollutant efficient form. And a good natural gas infrastructure can also be used in a future zero emmision economy, because we can use superfluous electricity and convert it to hydrogen or even methane. So in the future we can gradually go from natural gas to clean synthetic gas.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/brmieo/ranking_of_eu_political_groups_on_climate_change/eohlhyq/,Tagedieb,1558584817

As a ""national epic"", King Arthur is a better choice than Beowulf, on many levels, including that it's about an English court and more generally about struggles to hold the kingdom together. 

*Faust* is probably the most significant piece of German national literature. 

The list is kind of schizophrenic, though - there's no real reason to give the Nibelungenlied to ""Germany"" and exclude ""Austria"" - it's an ahistorical division for something written in 1200.

1291,"La Chanson de Roland for France? Meh. Technically it would be the Franciade (which is basically a follow up to the Eneid and narrates how Francus, son of Hektor, ""founded"" France). But since the text is lost, it could also be the History of Franks by Gregoire de Tours. The song of Roland is an epic, but certainly not a national epic, though it is an important work in medieval french literature. It doesn't tell you anything about  the ""essence or spirit"" of France.

However I would be tempted to say that no epic could be regarded as a national epic in France today. The epic genre is just too anecdotic in the literary history of our country, and even the Song of Roland fades in comparison with the best sellers of the time (that is the matter of Britain - arthurian cycle - and the matter of Rome - all kinds of texts inspired or about the antiquity). The Song of Roland is but one of the various examples of the matter of France, which is about the prowesses of supposedly real characters of the early Frankish history of France.

I think it's better to consider that the best examples of ""national epics"" in France are not, in fact, epics. The authors traditionally considered as the fathers of french literature are Du Bellay, Hugo, Moli√®re, Racine, Montaigne or Rabelais (the list goes on). I think it's a bit similar for England. Shakespeare is likely a better pick if you want some kind of ""national epic"" (that is not an epic, again). Beowulf is just too alien, and too different. It doesn't tell you the mythical founding of England, and it doesn't tell you anything about the ""spirit"" of the english nation.

And you are correct.
Poles were murdered and they were sent to concentration camps to. My aunt was taken to Auschwitz at the age of 12 She survived. My wife's paternal grandfather wasn't so lucky. Exterminated in Stutthof. 


A little personal story from 1970's, so no link that I can offer. 

Germans paid some money to Poland, in 1970's,  to be distributed to the survivors of German concentration camps. Most of it went to finance the gas pipeline from the USSR but there was a bit left for the survivors.



My aunt was approached by a Jewish woman she met in Auschwitz.  Aunt's friend needed a witness to be eligible for the compensation. No biggie, auntie signed, the Jewish woman got her few coins, but auntie decided not to apply. In her mind that was simple - she didn't want to be reminded monthly (when the compensation coins arrived) of the horrors she went through in the camp. Her kids insisted and so she applied.

You Americans alsways seem to miss the point that European nations didn't just pop up two centuries ago. At least for the older ones in here, there's an *unbroken* line dating back either to antiquity or to the early middle ages, and quite some narrative around it. 

However, the people who wrote those stories down at the time weren't aware that they wrote down a ""national epic"". They just told a story, and an important one at that (since nobody in the middle ages wrote down anything unless it was important).

Take, say, the German *Nibelungenlied*, which is indeed a formidable story, not least because it's a real tragedy (meaning the interpenetration of two rights). It was written down in the 11^th century, but the literary substance is much older, dating back to the 6^th or 7^th century (i.e. right after the Migration Period). It was an instant smash hit, not because it was so original, but because it's been a popular tale of oral history long before.

&gt; Chapter 4. Welfare reform in Britain, Australia and the United States

-

&gt; British commentators have made much play of the innovativeness of New Labour‚Äôs thinking. What many do not realise is that the policies that have emerged are very similar to the reforms that have been taking place in Australia in recent years.

1395,"&gt; Why should that money leave the country and go to people who are as much heirs to those properties as the Polish people you'd be taking that money away from? 

There are two possible answers for that. One would be that the use of heirless property for the benefit of needy Holocaust survivors is suggested in the Terezin declaration, the document that Poland and almost all other EU countries signed n 2009.

The other is that all Polish Jews were stripped of their assets and posessions, and therefore, all Polish Jews and their descendants are entitled to reparations or restitutions of their estates. In an ideal world, this would be individually based on their posessions held before the Holocaust, however, this is sheer impossible due to the ammount of victims, let alone that there is largely not enough papertrail or evidence left to accurately determine the posessions of all Jewish Poles before to the Holocaust. What is, however, possible, is to determine what possessions are currently under control of the polish government as a direct consequence of a Holocaust. And for those restitution or reperation has to be paid.

1434,"Sorry for the late reply, been busy today.

&gt;I don't get that? But lets say I believe you, I don't believe the number is correct, it's pretty impossible to have only 13% capacity with 75% coverage, when the average is 40.8% capacity with 50% coverage.

It's not impossible at all. First, the figure of 40% capacity as an average for Denmark is valid only for offshore wind turbines. Onshore turbines have much lower capacity factors. For Europe as a whole in 2018 the capacity factors were 22% onshore, 37% offshore: https://windeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/files/about-wind/statistics/WindEurope-Annual-Statistics-2018.pdf

Second, electricity consumption is much lower now than in winter (and will be lower late in the evening as well).

&gt;Still I'll grant that obviously at times it will indeed be at 13% locally, but probably very rarely on larger scale, 

I gave the figures for most of Western Europe yesterday. Belgium and Germany were the only countries with capacity factors above 14%. Denmark was at 13%, the UK, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands and Sweden were all below 10%.

&gt;and that's what we have chip plants for.

That was my original point. When wind speeds are lower than normal we have to burn stuff to make up for the shortfall in electricity production. We can't meet our targets if we continue to do that.

&gt;Plants that incidentally can be fueled with wood from Sweden, so still very low CO2.

According to the IPCC biomass has emissions of 230 grams of CO2 per KWH, and that doesn't include the emissions from the wood itself (because it absorbs CO2 as it grows). But even ignoring the short term increase in CO2 from the wood itself, the emissions are still multiple times safe levels. To put the 230 grams of CO2 per KWH in perspective, wind is 10 grams and nuclear 11 grams per KWH.

&gt;When it doesn't we have to compensate, which obviously we can, and we have proven is practically viable, with sometimes 100+% consumption covered from renewable, and sometimes very little. Still it works, and we have managed to reduce CO2 quite a lot using wind, and we are still expanding wind power.

Denmark has managed to reduce its emissions from electricity production to 5 or 6 times as high as France. It's managed to reduce them to 5 or 6 times safe limits. There is no plan in place to reduce them to French levels, or to safe limits. 

&gt;False, current projects are viable without subsidies and have been for a couple of years now. Our current government proudly announced 3 major new parks last year completely without subsidies.

Subsidies still come in the form of guaranteed minimum prices, site preparation and grid connections, and priority dispatch.

&gt;No it's not, average production is way higher, as we sometimes exceed what we need, and sometimes exceed 100% from wind alone. Obviously we cant use more than 100%. The 50% coverage from Wind is that actual coverage, NOT the average production.

Sorry, it is an average. Net electricity generation 2017 for Denmark:

Total 29,453 GWH  
Wind 14,777 GWH

https://en.energinet.dk/-/media/54B20C77CE954D7D98696520C23BAD6E.pdf

Wind was 50.2% of total generation over the year. That is an average. The fact that wind generation was sometimes more than 100% simply highlights that the 50% figure was an average.",,/r/europe/comments/br3ptw/german_storage_system_proves_batteries_profitable/eogyypa/,WhiteSatanicMills,1558568929

I'd like to preface this by saying I've appreciated your candid and sincere responses up until this point. I honestly had not planned for this discussion to take off the way it has, and certainly did not expect it to last more than a few hours, at best. To be frank, I was not prepared to legitimately engage with another user using any abundance of concrete evidence as the norm on reddit has, in my experience, been nothing other than name calling and ignorance of finer detail. I'll admit that, to some extent, I've been guilty of that as well.

Unfortunately, what amounted to many years of evidence that brought me to my positions and conclusions proved to be nothing more than fleeting memories. It is not due to the lack of substance regarding these things, but my own inability to find the relevant data exactly as it was recorded with only my memory as a reference. Unlike many debators, I do not keep detailed bookmarks or records of the things I see online, and I think that ultimately sabotaged my intentions in the matters we discussed. At the very least, it made corroborating all the evidence I provided for you a rather grueling task.

To the rest of this post, I will provide a single warning for you, and again, I provide this as a courtesy because I believe you have earned that much. Learning of your background makes this especially difficult.

If you do not doubt even the slightest record of your history, it is best that you stop reading here and we go our separate ways. If you elect to leave with that, then I'll say that even though we did not agree on a lot of things, it's been a pleasure and you have helped me in no small amount to refine my methods and sourcing, though I doubt I'll ever get too into discussions on this scale. I do appreciate it.

If you do elect to go forward, I can only hope that the free-floating ideas I have introduced to our conversations begin to make a bit more sense.

With that being said, let's see how long it takes me to get banned here, hm?

I'll preface this by saying this simply: any person is capable of being a terrorist. Any group, any political force, any religion, for any reason. This should be common sense, but just saying this can understandably cause people to grow wary.

Aesop's Fable : The Man and the Lion
&gt;Once upon a time a man and a lion were journeying together and came at length to high words, which was the braver and stronger creature of the two. As the dispute waxed warmer they happened to pass by, on the roadside, a statue of a man strangling a lion. ""See there,"" said the man; ""what more undeniable proof can you have of our superiority than that?"" ""That,"" said the lion, ""is your version of the story; let us be the sculptors, and for one lion under the feet of a man, you'll have twenty men under the paw of a lion.""

When people think of terrorism, they tend to think only of what they are most frequently exposed to, be that Islamic terrorism, narco-terrorism, or even more relevant, (as we have ABUNDANTLY established!) right or left-wing terrorism. What they don't consider is the terrorism which does not strike outwardly in broad strokes or with a claimant behind its damage. This kind of terrorism infests society like a cancer and twists at the core, degrading the morals of its victims while also convincing them to take on more of its poison. To this type of terrorist, all political parties are tools to subvert the populace and artificially simulate division. To this type of terrorist, the media becomes a convenient outlet to push this division and convince people that they are too different to coexist, thus causing their enemies to fight and defeat eachother. To this type of terrorist, nothing matters more than to establish a hegemony of their choosing while proving their own superiority for having accomplished the task of subversion on this grand of a scale.

Of course, this undertaking is no simple task. In order to accomplish such a feat, these terrorists must thoroughly intermix with the highest levels of government. They must amass as much wealth and power as they can get in order to ensure their continued existence. They must have ownership of the greatest and most popular banking institutions. They must convince their targets to take them in - that they are in need of protection - and will use their media assets to fabricate any number of stories or half-truths to protect their status. 

To that accord, nothing ever goes without a hitch. Occasionally, and less frequently as time goes on, do the terrorists find they are caught and expelled from a country once their plans have been uncovered. After all, most of what they do seems harmless without a full investigation into their activities. What's wrong with owning a little more wealth than other people? What's wrong with aiming to control a media corporation (or corporations), or to be an influential politician? To the ordinary onlooker, these terrorists might even seem patriotic. To astute governments, their activities might not always seem so benign. Like any noblemen in a monarchy, too many open connections means trouble. Too much wealth can lead to too much ownership or sway. Control of the news means control of the minds of the masses. That isn't to say their ethnicity didn't receive undue persecution. Perhaps fear gave way to false accusations, but what's important is that the terrorism remained.

And with due consideration, we witness the power of debt. These terrorists learned to use their wealth to accumulate even more wealth while also tying the debtors to their will. Payments of debt become exchanges of political favors. Legal immunity. Power advancement. Biased representation. From a truly neutral standpoint, these acts would appear completely sickening even without context. Thankfully, due to the overwhelming press ownership by these terrorists, you won't hear about them directly, anyways. But the proof of those dealings is plainly visible to those who are willing to see it. One needs only look for the overwhelming commonalities to determine the infection.

Throughout history, these terrorists have been acknowledged as a global threat. To every nation, to every people, to everyone. Countries that catch the infection are quick to throw these terrorists on the streets and out of the country. Neighboring countries hear of the developments and, seeing the results, also elect to expel the terrorists. Is it because the terrorists are minorities, as many historians are quick to point out? No, as we have postulated, their actions pose a much greater threat to be addressed. Their status as a minority is simply a red herring, as other minorities have never faced the same level of scrutiny, nor have they conspired at length against more than a handful of countries.

Perhaps greatest of all threats these terrorists presented, and most plain-to-see for the common man,  was the destruction of morality; this persisted beyond the absence of the terrorists. Wherever these terrorists appeared, alongside them appeared 'new, exciting' ideas. While financial debt was a fairly uncommon sight before private banking and the extortion surrounding that, other signs, such as sexual perversions or militant secularism became commonplace. These ideas shamed traditional morality as a 'backwards' ideology which prevented humanity's progress. These delightful half-truths took plant, utterly eradicating ideas such as the suppression of homosexuality or transgenderism, while also doing away with ideas like abstinence or loyalty to one's lover, or even the immunity of children.

Such was the case in one once-strong and now beleaguered nation which had been subject to brutal and devastating warring. A nation struck by hyperinflation, unpaid war reparations, and suffering from the fracturing of its people. A nation where communism was running rampant (the largest of such groups in the region), no less a part of its relative novelty at the time, in the streets and off the presses. A nation where cinema would run titles such as ""The Sins of the World"", ""Strictly Forbidden!"", or ""Sweet and Sinful"". Such was the impressive level of decadence that this nation's capital earned a place in history as perhaps the most immoral city in the world. Not discounting that, it also became the first nation to perform a successful sex reassignment surgery during the same time.

This was the case, until a group of zealous patriots witnessed the degradation of their country and called for an end to it. These people, led by a man with uncanny charisma and vision, witnessed the horror that occurred not only in their country, but also countries which surrounded them. One such country also suffered from such perversions and militant secularism. This neighboring country became known for its strong communist presence and the brutality of its regime. Seeing the similarities, and having been privy to the history of the time, this group of patriots successfully identified a commonality between the two nations; they had been infiltrated by the same terrorists which give no claim to their actions, but proliferate in positions of power. In what could have been seen as righteous retribution, this man and the group which followed him vowed to take back control of the country and oust the terrorists for who they were. Such was their vengeance that they created a pact between like-minded countries to fight back the perversion and the ideology which was proven to have sprouted as a result of these terrorist actions. That ideology has become known as communism today.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/bq3qk9/anticorrupution_protest_in_vienna_austria/eogz4nx/,Rognvaldi,1558569037

READ PARTS ONE &amp; TWO FIRST

*****

A Russian historian of the time by the name of Alexander Solzhenitsyn had this to share:

&gt;‚ÄúWe cannot state that all Jews are Bolsheviks. But without Jews, there would never have been Bolshevism. For a Jew, nothing is more insulting than the truth. The blood maddened Jewish terrorists have murdered sixty-six million in Russia from 1918 to 1957.‚Äù

&gt;""You must understand. The leading Bolsheviks who took over Russia were not Russians. They hated Russians. They hated Christians. Driven by ethnic hatred they tortured and slaughtered millions of Russians without a shred of human remorse. The October Revolution was not what you call in America the ""Russian Revolution."" It was an invasion and conquest over the Russian people. More of my countrymen suffered horrific crimes at their bloodstained hands than any people or nation ever suffered in the entirety of human history. It cannot be understated. Bolshevism was the greatest human slaughter of all time. The fact that most of the world is ignorant of this reality is proof that the global media itself is in the hands of the perpetrators."" 

It makes sense, then, that the ideology of Karl Marx, an ethnic Jew who [wrote poems to Satan](http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread880821/pg1) in addition to founding the concepts of communism and socialism, somehow found his ideology successfully pushed by the [Zionist/Rothschild-funded figures of Lenin and Trotsky.](http://www.wildboar.net/multilingual/easterneuropean/russian/literature/articles/whofinanced/whofinancedleninandtrotsky.html)

That being said, the book taught to children was called 'The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion'. Controversial, yes, but accurate, and that's the biggest tell in my book.

1454,"&gt;Polish Prime Minister describes potential restitution for Jews as 'a victory for Hitler'   

It is true IMHO. Jewish NGOs from USA would like to describe Poland as an participator in the Holocaust.  
They do that to extort money from Poland. If they would succeed in case of Poland - it would be a 'victory for Hitler' IMHO.   
And any country from our part of Europe could be the next victim.  

The issue is about so called heirless property.  
If someone is an heir and can prove it, he will receive the property. There are many examples of property recovery. Not only in case of Jews, but also for other races.  

It's about inheritance property. About the property of Polish citizens of Jewish descent who does not have an heir. American NGOs and the Israeli government are trying to extort ""compensation"" for this kind of property from Poland.  
It's as if the Catholic died without heirs and an organization of Catholics, for example from Mexico, wanted to take over his property because he was a Catholic.  
Or if a US citizen of Chinese descent died  without heir and country of China wanted to take over his property.  
This is not common with European/Roman law. It's common with the tribal law.   
Now they want to Congress to support they demands.  
Not to mention that Jewish organizations from USA did nothing to save their brothers during the Holocaust. Even they were [warned by Poles at that time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Karski#Reporting_Nazi_atrocities_to_the_Western_Allies).

This process is similar to the one described in prof Finkelstein [The Holocaust Industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust_Industry) - now is trying to extort money again IMHO. Germans refused to pay them and they are looking for other sources IMHO. They were  succesful in the case of Switzerland, but in the case of IBM they failed.

I hope that this extorting will fail in the case of countries of Eastern and Central Europe.

1572,"&gt; I suspect most of the new Green voters probably share your views on  nuclear - the problem is there are a lot of older greens who see nuclear  as purely bad. Unfortunately we have decades of this opinion and the  fear it generates and for most European countries new nuclear plants are  politically impossible. (It really doesn't help they keep coming in  hugely over budget and late). We could really do with one last  generation of nukes until we can manage to ramp up renewables (similarly  we could do without the opposition these seem to always generate). 

Yes, I know it is politically very hard... That's kind of my point, it is a political, and not technical, problem...

&gt; It's worth noting we probably need to hugely increase actual electric  power we are currently generating. Our power usage is roughly 1/3  electric, 1/3 transport and 1/3 industrial. We probably need to convert  most of our transport to run off electricity and industry is going to be  a huge problem to convert. A lot of their processes are going to be  almost impossible to shift off fossil fuels. 

This is also true. Changing the vehicle park to electric vehicles will increase power demand.","Spain, European Federation",/r/europe/comments/brmieo/ranking_of_eu_political_groups_on_climate_change/eogn7ic/,NombreGracioso,1558561443

So no real advantage. Just binding producers to GMO producers.

2. The best thing that GMO farms offer is fewer farms and more wild spaces, which is the best outcome for the environment in the long run.

I agree. This is an advantage.

3. GMO crops have the potential to be the most diverse and the easiest to respond to new threats. If a super pest develops, change the genes. 

But you will have lost 100% of the crop in the meanwhile. In addition to putting food supply in the hands of profit-driven corporations, it's dangerous and forces humanity to an arms race against nature which we cannot win.

&gt; Regulating big businesses and using modern GMO technology is the best and safest way to protect the environment.

Like we regulated mining, fossil fuels and fishing. Pardon my skepticism.

&gt; There is nothing that you have mentioned here that is consistent with the current understanding of the science. It sounds like climate denialism, to be frank.

I've Kurdish friends and they start to learn Turkish with us at school, because it's a state language. Even myself I learned Istanbul Turkish at school. There are also language institutes, organizations and so on that teach Kurdish or any other language.

It has been always like that in Turkey. The same thing goes in America, there are many ethnicities in the US but English is widely spoken and one should know it.

1875,"&gt; I did not do any poll nor any notification.

As expected

&gt;Jesus Why do you assume I did it

I didn't.

&gt; why would you assume that I would assume that if i did poll family and friends?

Because you literally said so:

&gt;Well let's say I get this notification. Some of my friends and family get this notification and some of em don't.

&gt; The idea behind this would be to outline reasons for me to go looking further than just that: a)noticing not everyone getting the notification and b) not finding any fitting explanation for it.

I.e. the whole idea behind it being easy to spot is the assumption it would be easy to notice it, with no good reason for such assumption.

&gt;Well firstly again one would need a reason for doing so. Such as not everyone in ones country using google based android getting the notification without a valid explanation for that.

So have you polled whether everyone in ones country using google based android got the notification?

&gt;What? What you're saying is equivalent to saying 'Huawei is accused of spying on it's users, why do you still use electronics?'... are you serious? Stop misconstruing/misreading what I say.

No. First of you've completely neglected to mention the nation-criteria which was involved. Secondly being accused is completely different from being shown. Thirdly only if you argued that if it was shown that using electronics had risks you'd stop using them (as much as possible), and it had in fact been shown.

&gt;It had it's effect 

Stock fluctuations do not directly show a impact on the company, but impact on the expected value of the future profit generated by the company, (or something like it anyway, if I got it right exactly is not important for the purpose of this discussion).

If the stock tanks on the day a negative news concerning a companies business hits the news, it doesn't mean there was any real impact on the company, only that there was impact on the future expected profit generated by the company.

&gt;It didn't involve the EU in areas where it has competences really

How come is that? Weren't they involved in Brexit vote? If Brexit vote involvement is not involving EU in areas where it has competences how would this then be?

&gt; as I said it would be way worse given it's nature.

Only if you got caught doing so, and I think it's very hard to proof so the risk is very low if you do it in a smart way.

Yes, these are fair points. Particularly the first one. But the second one... well, you don't know 100% if it will be make a nature preserve, but you know 100% it will not with ecological agriculture. 

&gt; That's in theory possible. In practice, most GMOs are made to *encourage* the use of insecticides, not to reduce it. Because that increases profits. 

That is not a problem of GMOs themselves, but of the current business model. They could and should work to change that, instead of just bitching about GMOs in general. 

&gt; Greens oppose GMOs because of the precautionary principle. It's really  not acceptable to experiment in the open environment like that. There  are plenty of examples like DDT, asbestos, nuclear waste etc. that were  touted as the technological miracle solution, but they turned out to be  harmful and costly afterwards. So the approach should be reversed:  instead of permitting everything and banning it after it goes wrong, we  should default to a ban and approve case by case after sufficient  research. GM inside the lab isn't opposed by the Greens, it's the  ecological contamination risk. 

There hasn't been a single reputable study I have heard of that has pointed to GMOs having an impact on human health. About other things (ecological impact, etc.), yes, I agree that you should be cautious. I am not saying ""GMOs for everyone!"", but rather ""Green Parties should stop with their hate-boner for them"". Nuclear waste is a good example. If you do it properly, it won't ever give you a single problem. If you don't it will.

1961,"&gt;Nuclear definitely has a role to play in achieving zero emissions, since solar panels only work during the day, wind turbines only work when there is wind, and batteries are not going to scale to country-demand sizes anytime soon. Having nuclear power as a backup for those times when renewables are not available temporarily is the only way of guaranteeing the supply while being carbon-free. 

Nuclear energy efficiency statistics usually assume that the plant can run at maximum efficiency all the time, with the rest of the grid bending around it. If you make nuclear plants run as peaker plants, their costs easily double, if they are capable of it at all. In practice, nuclear energy competes with renewables for access to flexible plants like gas and hydro to make up for the moments when they can't adapt to demand efficiently.

Furthermore, it locks up capital into the present day technological state for half a century or longer. Renewables have much faster innovation and implementation cycles.

&gt;and while I agree with ""Monsanto bad"", that does not imply ""GMOs bad"". 
&gt;GMOs have a lot to say with respect to more efficient crops that (for example) don't need as much water, are more resistant to extreme temperatures, or are immune to bugs (hence avoiding pesticides).

The *legislation* introduced after the protests (at least over here, I'm referring to Bavaria specifically) was pretty much exclusively a feelgood initiative, resulting in way too little way too late. Did more happen where you live?

Yes, people thinking bees are cute helped at least get *some* momentum and that's nice and all, but we're more than two decades after strong warning signs, almost nothing was (and is) invested in relevant research and some of the most pressing issues (e.g. ways for populations to easily move between isolated ""preserved"" areas) are completely ignored.

We have utterly terrible datasets for most insect populations over here, basically all we can do is say ""it's bad"" but that's the extent of it. When I tried to figure out the status of ants in my area for example the latest official information was from 1998, done by a handful of people and their conclusion for roughly 40% of species was: ""not sure, might be extinct here or not"".

You're also not accounting for dropping costs of renewables and storage, which has consistently outperformed expectations in the latest years. Conversely, nuclear plant construction also consistently is over time and over budget.

&gt;This is true, but: the demand for energy will probably rise in the future, and solar panels need to be replaced every couple of decades.

2013,"&gt;Male and female brains differ somewhat in their structure. Research indicates that male to female transgender persons have a brain structure more typical of a female brain. Female to male trans people have brains that are more akin to male brains.

I have found really mixed results in studies. For example it seems like transgender women have more gray matter than the cisgender woman counterpart. At the very least it suggests that transgender women *do not* have the exact same brain as women.

&gt;You don't need to tell me that I suffer from discrimination, I can experience that fairly frequently on my own.

I'm sorry to hear that but did you not expect this to happen before you decided to transition? I just don't get what the point is.

&gt;So, you're an authority on science all of a sudden? Alone against hundreds of actual scientists educated in the field. You're getting more ridiculous by the minute.

I've read multiple studies, first of all the cause of this different gender identity and the corresponding changes in the brain are largely not understood. Additionally it is questionable whether transitioning actually leads to a solution of the mental problems if we assume that biologically transitioning doesn't work properly yet and most of society will probably not automatically accept you as the gender that you want to be identified as. Why? Because the natural response of people seems to be that they see you as the gender that you were born as due to the physical traits you have.

Of course that doesn't mean that we should ban people from doing with their body whatever they want, but that doesn't mean it's the best solution. In 50 years we might look back at this as a failure of dealing with mental problems.

&gt;You have your head so far up your arse that you aren't even contemplating the arguments I have presented. Instead, you just ignore them and insist on your point of view.

2054,"&gt; there are several studies that show that mass agriculture is better for the environment (once you subtract pesticides, etc.) than ""ecological"" agriculture

I suppose it depends on what indicators are used to determine what's good for the environment or not.

A large monoculture will be more reliant on heavy mechanized tools that compact the soil, making it more difficult for the roots to penetrate, for soil life to expand, etc. It will also lead to an increased impoverishment of soil nutrients, etc. All these drawbacks are compensated by adding fertilizers that aren't without problems themselves, such as eutrophication of fresh waters leading to proliferation of algae and death of wildlife. And of course, monocultures are also more susceptible to disease and parasites, which makes pesticides necessary, having side effects such as killing bees etc.

All in all, monocultures lead to loss of soil fertility and decrease in biodiversity. So yes, maybe that the marginal decrease in cultured land is a positive point for fighting climate change, but I'm not sure the environment is that much better off.

2086,"&gt;I guess my previous edit was too late, that was a badly structured sentence. I meant people who believe that LGBT should not be able to voice their opinion.

Yea i saw the edit too late, just like you probably didn't see mine either. But hey, i think we agree. Everyone should be able to voice their opinion.

&gt; My point is that we should talk to people who don't share our opinions,  so that people in echo chambers that agree with the point of the vocal  extremists, but can also also see the merrit of your argument, would at  least get to hear it. Even if you have to sometimes talk as bluntly as  the extremists do. 

What im trying to say is that there are more and more extreme points being taken into the mainstream that start to make less and less sense, because the current consensus seems to be an echo chamber in of its own. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Well  sure, but if you have a whole country that decides to shift to  primarily extreme opinions, you should maybe reconsider your own  country's relation and support of them.

Of course, there should always be a well thought out response from my own country in how to deal with it. But that is difficult too, i mean, when a country won't allow gay marriage/relations then as a country i would really warn affected people not to go there if possible. There are more options to pressure other countries, but if im honest, things like sanctions really aren't a good thing and should be avoided at all cost.

2159,"&gt;People who really believe that LGBT is the downfall of society and should be denied even a voice to say that, are not going to change their minds because you talked nicely to them.

You are basically saying:""You should not be able to voice your opinion if i do not share in it"". If these same religious people would be just as intolerant then all gays would still be burned at the stake.

Talking is the only way you will ever be able to convince them of anything else. You can not simply convince people of them being wrong by treating them without respect.

&gt; I see the point in always trying to be respecful, but sometimes you are  not arguing against ideas based on logic, but perjudice based on a  lifetime of being told that the old ways are the correct ways and a fear  of any kind of change. 

You can still point out in a respectful manner why you think that they are wrong.

&gt; They can even see or even visit other countries that have changed their  ways, and are not the dystopian hellhole they think theirs will become,  but still they keep that argument. 

That is not an argument, firstly what may not seem as a dystopian hellhole to you might seem very much like a dystopian hellhole to someone else. The problem is that not everyone will put the same value on something. And secondly, just because something seemed to work in one culture doesn't mean that it would work the same in other cultures.

What does that even mean ""hard wired to be the opposite sex""? That makes no sense biologically.

So you are saying that transsexuals do not face discrimination and rejection from family and society? Because I think that is the main reason for unhappiness. Here it says: ""According to a study published in the July 2016 edition of The Lancet offers significant evidence that the ""distress and impairment, considered essential characteristics of mental disorders"" among transgender individuals primarily arises in response to the discrimination, stigma, lack of acceptance, and abuse they face on an unfortunately regular basis."" (https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-truth-about-exercise-addiction/201612/why-transgender-people-experience-more-mental-health)

&gt;That face when even the slightest adaption is too much to take for the cisgender person. You are a sad example of a human being.

I never said that, I would never harass or insult someone else for a reason like that. But the point is that society can never really accept it, because the transitioning doesn't even work completely. You still don't really look like a woman in terms of body structure, nor do you sound like one. Maybe in 200 years we will be able to perfectly surgically transform someone from one gender to the other but currently it is impossible.

2269,"&gt; Why do have countries with less citizens have more seats?

To compensate for their smaller bargaining power. For example, if there's a notion that all French MEPs agree on because there's a particular consensus on the subject inside their country, they form a significant group in the EP that has leverage to tip decisions either way. This is less likely for smaller countries.

&gt;This only takes away power from citizens and gives it to leaders.

No, it merely redistributes it between citizens, even if it didn't serve as compensation for another effect.

&gt;The EU council should not have any power and only be a consultative institution for the EU parliament.

2339,"In France, pizza is the kind of dish you would eat once a week because it's easy to buy, easy to eat and quite hard to make a bad pizza (so it's reliable). It's not particularly expansive either, and it's perceived as more healthy than fast food (I say perceived because I doubt so much cheese is that healthy). So everyone is happy.

Culturally, pizza nights are also a big thing. It's hard to imagine a roleplay night without pizzas. Many families also have a pizza night every week (usually on Friday).

Restaurants are something else entirely. You go to the restaurant because you want to spend a lot of time eating something delicious. It's more expansive, and happens much less often, generally on great occasions. It's not rare to stay at the restaurant for 2-3 hours. So yes, there are more pizzerias than other restaurants in France, but it's because they have different purposes.

Pizzerias would be more comparable to sushi or thai restaurants in France. You can eat in situ or bring the meal back home, so you don't have to cook and you know it will taste good.",,/r/europe/comments/brfly5/the_doner_kebab_an_unlikely_symbol_of_european/eoeqfdn/,OgreAdept,1558504512

2341,"&gt;Let's agree that ""the moment you agree with my view you reach adulthood and stop thinking like a kid"" is stupid.

No it is true. As a kid you are meant to believe that everyone would just get along as long as everyone understands each other and works together. When you grow up it is where you learn that there is competition and the one who does not compete will lose and ultimately will perish. 

Good example of that is Switzerland. Everyone points out that this is perfect example of kid logic but they don't know that every citizen has gun and whole nations defense is oriented toward defense coupled with their terrain make it really hard to get target for barely any benefit as nation is not rich in resources or land. 

&gt;Nations don't compete just over economy. They compete over other things too like power to influence other countries. 

Economy is ultimate coin here. People do not conquer some place because they want some title. They do that for money. You have very naive view on history.

Not following economy in wars is rarity but do occasionally happen.

&gt;It was the nuclear arms race, not GDP race after all.

2404,"&gt; Well, if there's no evidence for the assertions you are making, then why are we talking about it as though we're talking about facts?

What's your source for your cultural source theory then? It is not hard to deduce that if something is common among all cultures, it's more likely innate, while if something is unique to a subset of cultures, it's more likely to be culturally influenced. 

&gt; And since you don't provide evidence for your views but only vague guesses, I assume for the moment that these questions are far from answered.

Fair. 

There is this however which I found interesting: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254081226_Culture_and_Crying

&gt; Individuals living in more affluent, democratic, extraverted, and individualistic countries tend to report to cry more often. These indicators relate to freedom of expression rather than to suffering; therefore, our data provide support for a model that views country differences in crying as being connected with country differences in expressiveness and personality rather than in distress. Gender differences in crying proneness were larger in wealthier, more democratic, and feminine countries.

If I look at the stats in figure 1, it seems the largest impact is that women tend to cry more in wealthier countries while male variability is lower and less correlated. What's also noticable is that of all countries, there is only one pairing where men of country A cry more than women of country B (Italian men vs Nigerian women).

If I have more time, I'd love to get the exact correlation statistics between tendency to cry and GDP / freedom indices / quality of life indices and gender. It's pretty obvious that the latter is still the largest impactor from the data at hand

Obviously nothing is 100% nature and 100% nurture, but the link is obvious. What I can't find however, and what is crucial to this debate but very hard to measure, is how much of human cultures is biologically defined. If all cultures in the world have a certain pressure on men to not cry (as indicated), can we say that that aspect of all cultures is not biologically influenced? I can't source that.

&gt; Have you ever wondered why conservatism is being pushed back and supposed leftism has been on the upswing? Might be that some, maybe just some, contemporary left-wing ideas have merit. It surprises me profoundly that you don't seem to have questioned your beliefs in this regard, seeing that it causes you such grief.

Some do have merit and I absolutely have no problem with that. Some don't have merit though, or some more conservative ideas also have merit but are phased out. The problem is not that some policies become more progressive, it's that EVERY change seems to be going in that direction. Or do you honestly believe not a single phased out, currently seen as conservative, policy has any merit?

&gt; You may actually make yourself acquainted with feminism and queer theory if you are looking for answers for why masculinity is criticised.

No thanks.

&gt; 1) Do these issues befall Flanders only or all Western societies?

&gt; 2) What are the skills that children have learned since this supposed paradigm shift in education that they hadn't learned before?

&gt; 3) Are these new skills already represented in PISA scoring?

1) Stronger in Flanders, but affect [many Western societies that slowly slip in PISA rankings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment#Results). In 2003, the west had 6 in the top 10, with the  10^th western country scoring 514. In the latest scores, only 3 western countries make the top 10, and the 10^th western country scores 504. Strongest descenders are Finland (-33), Australia (-30), New Zealand (-28), Iceland (-27), Netherlands (-26), Czech Republic (-24), Slovakia (-23), Belgium (-22). All western.

2) There is more openness and tolerance in the current young generation than before, though that's a common thread over time. Not sure how much education plays into this. Personally, I don't see that many positives to be honest. Fewer kids feel stress at school, ambition has been lowered and aspects of cooperation are more key than aspects of success.

3) What? Pisa scoring is about educational skills, not how many progressive views students have internalized.",Belgian in NZ,/r/europe/comments/brc2jq/lgbt_school_lessons_protests_spread_nationwide/eoegwuq/,TheApatheist,1558496243

As a consequence, the EU trade surplus in services reached ‚Ç¨190.1 billion in 2018, 0.8% below the value for 2017.

EU exports were dominated by ""other business services"" (R&amp;D, business, professional and technical services), which accounted for a quarter of total extra-EU exports (25%), followed by transport (18%) and travel services (15%). 

‚ÄúOther business services‚Äù were also the largest category of services imported by the EU (29% of EU imports), ahead of transport services (18%), travel (15%) and charges for the use of intellectual property (15%).

The EU surplus in 2018 was mainly due to surpluses in telecommunications, computer and information services (+‚Ç¨82.0 billion), transport (+31.9 billion), travel (+‚Ç¨30.7 billion) and financial services (+‚Ç¨32.1 billion).  A deficit of ‚Ç¨41.1 billion was recorded in charges for the use of intellectual property. 

The United States, top partner for both exports and imports

In 2018, the main partners for EU exports of services remained the United States (27% of extra-EU exports) and Switzerland (13%), ahead of China (6%) and Japan (4%). The main partner for EU imports of services also continued to be the United States (31% of extra-EU imports), followed by Switzerland (8%) and China (4%).

In 2018, the EU recorded surpluses for trade in services with all its main partners, except India (-‚Ç¨2.6 billion). By far the largest surplus was observed with Switzerland (‚Ç¨57.9 billion), ahead of the United States (‚Ç¨23.1 billion), China* (‚Ç¨21.2 billion), Japan (‚Ç¨14.9 billion) and Russia (‚Ç¨14.1 billion).",Romania,/r/europe/comments/brkh3o/eu_trade_balance_in_services_1901_billion_surplus/eoelxoc/,filosoful,1558500344

2512,"&gt; The next question would be, are they raised in such a way that they are more introverted than is good for their mental health? I would definitely say so.

If they are, in all cultures of all times, it's more likely to be something innate than just something all cultures coincidentally happened to agree on. If anyone is teaching boys to hide their emotions, it's other boys. And those boys aren't being taught at home to bully other kids who are different, they are innately that way. 

I really hate this new idea in the last decade or so that all humans are blank slates with zero innate biological personality characteristics and zero inter-group variability. It's based on no research and no question for sources for these fallacious axioms can ever be presented. 

&gt; People, you included, seem to have that strange idea that school is simply for learning subjects. It's not, it's for learning for life. The raising of children does not stop at the doorstep to the parents' house. All of society has to be and is involved in the education of the next generation.

Then us, the rest of society, should have a say about what kind of non-learning subjects are taught to our children and what not. 

I don't mind other life skills being taught, but if they're all coming from a left-progressive angle and there is no way to counter that because that's just a field that happens to be popular among progressives, then I do have a problem with that. Just like I had a problem that at university, on an exam I had to quote my hometown as an example of successful multiculturalism when my parents suffered 10+ burglaries in that city. 

If society decides children should be taught more at school, then why can't I vote on that? Openness and understanding equality of value despite differences is one thing, but what about other values that are slowly being eroded away? I want schools to turn up discipline again after decades of dialing back that knob, I want there to be more male school teachers again and I want boys to be educated in a way that motivates them instead of having them subjected to a more feminine culture for 12 years. I don't want them to just learn how to be accepting and openminded and friendly; I also want schools to teach in masculine ways, teach through action, let kids fail, let them compete, win, lose, learn to be a good winner, learn to deal with losses and get back up etc. Not just all this esoteric equality shite.

2531,"You make way too many assumptions about boys being boys. Before we can make any assertions in your direction, a couple questions have to be raised. Is there evidence that boys are raised the same across cultures? If not, the question is whether in Western culture, boys are raised in such a fashion that makes them more or less introverted. Another question should be whether and, if yes, how strongly Western standards of child rearing contribute to males growing out of touch with their emotions to the degree of it becoming unhealthy.

&gt; I really hate this new idea in the last decade or so that all humans are blank slates with zero innate biological personality characteristics and zero inter-group variability.

Nice strawman.

&gt; Then us, the rest of society, should have a say about what kind of non-learning subjects are taught to our children and what not. 

You have a say. Why don't you use it? It's not like leftism is an unstoppable behemoth that crushes every opponent in plain sight. The persistence of conservatism is enormous as can be seen by the amount of resistance pro-LGBT views get on this sub, for instance. 

What you can do to have your voice heard in educational policy is engaging in politics and voting for the force(s) that best represent(s) your views, like everybody else does. 

&gt; I also want schools to teach in masculine ways, teach through action, let kids fail, let them compete, win, lose, learn to be a good winner, learn to deal with losses and get back up etc. I want them to get somewhat hurt on the playground and not cry about the booboo, but learn from the event that caused them pain

As if these things aren't still taught. What you and others don't seem to understand about this whole education reform is that it isn't about doing away with masculinity and femininity but to identify undesirable developments and present possible improvements in order to provide added value for all of society. Boys who are on the more 'feminine' side characterwise may have little to no use for being taught exclusively 'masculine' traits but that's how it was done when I was still in school in the late 90s and early 00s. Likewise, tomboy girls would probably prefer playing rough-and-tumble with the masc boys.

2554,"&gt; Is there evidence that boys are raised the same across cultures? If not, the question is whether in Western culture, boys are raised in such a fashion that makes them more or less introverted. 

No, the assertion is that despite education being wildly different across all cultures, the question of met not being as open emotionally seems a universal quality of men regardless of culture and upbringing. Which is why I believe it's innate, or these various cultures would have shown very different end results.

&gt; Nice strawman.

It isn't. You yourself are using the blank slate theory and just want to pin everything down on something in western culture.

&gt; You have a say. Why don't you use it? It's not like leftism is an unstoppable behemoth that crushes every opponent in plain sight. The persistence of conservatism is enormous as can be seen by the amount of resistance pro-LGBT views get on this sub, for instance.

Feel free to tell me how? Should I go into education training at university, where professors are increasingly left biased year on year and where conservatives are actually not welcome? Should I vote for commissions I have no voting right over? Or am I forced to vote for the harder right wing parties as all the other don't seem to care too much?

Thing is, these policies are often set by committees composed of political party representatives and ""specialist"", with the latter being ever more left leaning over time. So one has to start at asking question why social sciences are becoming increasingly biased, increasingly intolerant to non-progressive viewpoints (and you're graded on them), and what caused this shift since the 90s. 

&gt;  What you and others don't seem to understand about this whole education reform is that it isn't about doing away with masculinity and femininity but to identify undesirable developments and present possible improvements in order to provide added value for all of society.

Yes, and my critique is that the majority of the focus is always on male elements being the problem. It's always about more inclusion, more openness, more equality, more tolerance, more oversight, more cooperation, but never about more discipline, more competition, more freedom, more chances to learn how to fail. All the undesirable elements that they seem to find are always about supposed toxic masculinity.

You speak of the late 90s, but a lot of things have worsened since then. Some school activities are scrapped caused too dangerous (cause someone broke an arm some day) or too excluding (cause a $40 fee is asked), fun playgrounds are being dismantled and replaced by boring 2m tall plastic playhouses for toddlers, competition has decreased and the focus has shifted more towards getting the weakest over the minimum bar rather than making the prodigious excel. Flemish school ratings on PISA scores have dropped since the 90s as discipline and learning took a backseat to inclusion and shielding kids from failure or feeling inferior to others. We're getting worse at languages and maths, we're producing the least ambitious students of the world now. Even special schools for the mentally challenged became offensive so they had to be merged with IQ 150 kids sitting in the same elementary school class as the poor kid with Downs. So that everybody can feel equal...

Give me back those rough and tumble 90s.

You may actually make yourself acquainted with feminism and queer theory if you are looking for answers for why masculinity is criticised.

&gt; Flemish school ratings on PISA scores have dropped since the 90s as discipline and learning took a backseat to inclusion and shielding kids from failure or feeling inferior to others. We're getting worse at languages and maths, we're producing the least ambitious students of the world now.

A few questions:

1) Do these issues befall Flanders only or all Western societies? In the latter case, 

2) What are the skills that children have learned since this supposed paradigm shift in education that they haven't learned before?

3) Are these new skills already represented in PISA scoring?",Minister for Agitation and Propaganda,/r/europe/comments/brc2jq/lgbt_school_lessons_protests_spread_nationwide/eoeem42/,Martha-Helen,1558494550

You still have not provided any counter-evidence.
The masked Arab refers to many tafsirs that are universally recognized in the Muslim world and have existed long before the official wahabi-movement. What do you have to offer instead? What are those official Muslim sources that contradict the interpretation of Surah 65:4 I provided for example? Show them. You were not even brave enough to engage any one of the arguments I presented for this verse. Not one. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure that the Ahmadiyya movement or Zakir Naik don‚Äôt represent that many Muslims, yet you don‚Äôt hesitate to refer to them. You can talk all you want, but you have shown no evidence. The masked Arab provided many sources, many in Arabic und you don‚Äôt even bother to listen to one. Yes, he also quoted a salafi website. So what? I hope you realize that for the bad reputation that they have in some parts of the Muslim world, they are aligned with many mainstream Sunni position. Therefore just because something is quoted by salafis, does not mean it‚Äôs wrong. Even salafis refer to ancient Islamic traditions. 
The salafis are certainly closer to Islamic traditions than ahmadiyya Muslims. 

Show me those so-called LEGITIMATE Islamic sources that say that you cannot marry prepubescent girls for example. Just show them. Show me a better interpretation of 65:4. A better interpretation of this verse than the ones provided by the most authoritative tafsirs in Islamic history.

My take on it is that political traditions are strong and take time to change and 1990 is only thirty years ago (damn i'm getting old).

&gt; Meciar

He was a politician of his time, he grew up with the perception that to be a good leader and PM you had to be strong and a bit authorative and not be weak enough to depend on others. 

He also lead Slovakia out of the union with Czechia (yep i'm using it) which i can't decide if it was good or bad non the less it was a difficult time for both young nations.

What u/brazzy42 said is correct - humans are animals first and foremost, and any morality and ethics come to you mostly from being passed on by your parents and your surroundings.

Even if you're not entirely wrong here, the fact remains we're animals, not robots following strict commands. It's difficult to expect someone to be totally moral 100% of the time.

Take monogamy for example - albeit very important for civilization, it's not ""natural""; it isn't something hard-wired into our brains. Even if you tell absolutely everyone to be monogamous, some will not be able to regulate themselves and fall prey to their impulses. Hence why there'll always be cheating.

2667,"&gt;contradicts yourself, right? You said communism killed about 250 millions, while the sources in the wiki article range all between 60-160 millions

contract? dude, that isnt what the word contradict means... lmao

160 v 250 million is what youre arguing about? so 160 is much better? maybe its 160 if youre looking at people shot by communists, but when you then look at those starved to death or dead from reasons related to communist takeover, 250 is a low ball

&gt;Of course a city full of rich people will have less crime, even if it's more dense than a city with polr people

right, so it's not the guns causing crime, it's people wanting to break the law 

&gt;You get that poverty exists much more in cities, right? Just looking at one aspect doesn't make all the other ones go away

poverty exists in the country too you sheltered sap 

&gt;Last major european terrorist attack was more then half a year ago, and the us had 105 mass shootings THIS YEAR ALONE Source

105 mass shootings? it's easy to get a high number when you count attacks that involve only a few people getting shot in a country of 350+ million people. 

and only half a year ago for europe? that sucks dude, hundreds die in Muslim terror attacks

I'd take sporadic shooting of a few people any day over Islamic terrorism... we lose far fewer people

almost 100 dead in Nice France... UK had children's concert bombed, Sweden, Germany, Spain etc having families ran over in the streets. It's awful dude. I remember seeing the photo of little 11 year old Swedish Ebba, ripped in half in the road with her dead dog nearby after a Muslim ran her over. So sad to see Europe fall. France had over 100 Churches set fire this year.... chaos man

&gt;You know that europe is escentially one big ""gun free"" zone. There is no such thing as consealed carry in europe. And guess what? 5x lower murder rate than the us

see, leftists struggle immensely w/ basic logic, math, and science 

it's not the guns, as you yourself conceded earlier. Mexico, Honduras, Brazil, etc, also have gun bans, just like Europe, but they also have murder rates 5-10x higher than the United States. 

how can you blame the presence of guns in the USA for its murder rate, if other countries with gun bans like Europe have a higher murder rate? how can you not grasp that there are **other factors** that lead to people shooting each other? Actually, you CAN grasp it. But it slips away from you every time you reach the conclusion because you've been brainwashed too hard. You at first blamed density for the US city violence... but when I proved that Orange County is more dense than LA but with a lower murder rate, you MOVED THE GOAL POST. 

See... Orange county is more dense w/ more guns and 20,000+ ccw holders compared to Los Angeles, but it has a far lower murder rate. This is a fact, but it clashes with your world view, because your world view as stated is that more guns = more murder. But that is factually false. All across the world you can find many instances of more guns = less murder. When you consider all the factors, you reach the logical conclusion that guns are UNRELATED to murder rate. 

You can have gun bans and be relatively safer, such as in some European areas. You can also have tons of guns and be super safe, as in Orange County CA, Idaho, etc. Comparatively, you can have gun bans and be in a lot of danger, such as in liberal cities in the USA and in Mexico, Brazil, etc. Basically the **only** causal relationship between guns and crime is that more guns = less crime. But the lack of guns will not make your area safe, as we see in Mexico. 

That's the logical conclusion. That is what the facts support. Gun bans dont make you safe. Proper culture and living conditions make you safe. Orange county is safe, despite being super dense, with plenty of guns, because guns dont cause violence. Bad people too. Also note that Orange County may be rich overall but it has many very poor areas, like Santa Ana, with 70%+ Hispanic demographics. 

&gt;No go zones are a myth

I literally linked you 60 minutes trying to disprove it and they found it true. I remember vividly after a mass shooting in Paris that police and military went into a Muslim no-go zone and bombs were going off. I remember CNN accidentally showing a severed head and spine of a Muslim in the road after she tried bombing police.

2711,"Similarly, I can understand the German/European perspective given the rather recent history in the 20th century. That said, I just don't think a German approach to free speech would ever work in the US. As the poster above you said, the jurisprudence in the US has seen a strengthening of many parts of the bill of rights in a post-WWII environment. Many Americans including myself view this as a moral imperative, and going backward from this, in my opinion, is immoral. I don't really think it is moral to be able to restrict speech unless that speech presents a clear and present danger to another person/group of people, which is basically how the US does it. 

I think saying the US ""needs"" to follow the German model assumes that the goal of free speech is to propagate good ideas in the first place. I don't think free speech's goal is to propagate good ideas if you ask most Americans, I don't think they'd say the goal of free speech is to propagate good ideas, to begin with. Good ideas are completely subjective. The history of the US teaches me that I cannot trust the gov't to legislate the legality of speech. When the government has tried to, it was rarely in the interest of everyone, it was either in the interests of white America or the military industrial complex. Tons of books in history like Fahrenheit 451, 1984, Brave New World have told stories of what happens when ideas are not allowed to propagate. 

I don't trust any authority to determine what speech is legal or illegal. I am just as pessimistic about humanity, the difference is where our pessimism is directed, which is actually quite interesting and is really telling of our respective national origins. 

I can't really see the German model as moral, not because I don't view it as valid or that I don't understand the logic that led to this model, I do. I just fundamentally disagree with it and I feel it goes against what free speech is all about, I view it as inherently authoritarian. As do I view any restriction of almost all speech. Although earlier I said I agreed with it, I'm still pretty dicey on restricting speech based on content like a present danger to another. As I feel even that could quickly be skewed if enough judges were systematically replaced over many decades.

&gt;We have concluded that LA is less dense than Orange County and has stricter gun laws, yet far more murder. You keep moving the goalposts... from ""density"" to ""poverty"" but all the while trying to blame the ""tool.""

Im not ""moving goal posts"", am I? I just factor in all aspects that lead to crime. Of course a city full of rich people will have less crime, even if it's more dense than a city with polr people. Those are quite standard logical causations.


&gt;Note that the USA's total number of ""5 per 100,000"" is a mix of places that are conservative like Orange County, or Idaho, with its 1 per 100,000 rates (or less) with democrat cities like Baltimore that have over 50 per 100,000. Clearly the issue is NOT guns. If it were guns, Orange County and Idaho would have far more murder. Democrat cities are extremely strict with gun laws, but criminals break the law. 

You get that poverty exists much more in cities, right? Just looking at one aspect doesn't make all the other ones go away. 

&gt;Also, the tool may make some subtle differences, but we still have Muslims going on knife sprees in the UK and killing multiple people. We still have Muslims driving cars into crows and killing hundreds on numerous occasions all across Europe. What next... we ban cars and knives?

In CA every school is intentionally made defenseless. It's sad. In other states like TX they have armed guards.

You know that europe is escentially one big ""gun free"" zone. There is no such thing as consealed carry in europe. And guess what? 5x lower murder rate than the us!

&gt; Islam does not give a specific age for marriage, either for the husband or for the wife. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
‚ÄúAnd for such of your women as despair of menstruation, if ye doubt, their period (of waiting) shall be three months, along with those who have it not‚Äù
[al-Talaaq 65:4].¬†
Al-Sa‚Äòdi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ‚Äúalong with those who have it [menses] not‚Äù means minors, those who have not yet started to menstruate. Adult women who have never menstruated at all are like those who ‚Äúdespair of menstruation‚Äù (i.e., have passed menopause); their ‚Äòiddah is three months. End quote.¬†
Tafseer al-Sa‚Äòdi, p. 870¬†

Here another source from the masked Arab: 
https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22442/on-acting-and-the-ruling-on-marrying-young-girls

&gt; Marrying a young girl before she reaches the age of adolescence is permitted in sharee‚Äôah; indeed it was narrated that there was scholarly consensus on this point.¬†
(a)Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
‚ÄúAnd those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them the ‚ÄòIddah (prescribed period), if you have doubt (about their periods), is three months; and for those who have no courses [(i.e. they are still immature) their ‚ÄòIddah (prescribed period) is three months likewise‚Äù
[al-Talaaq 65:4]
In this verse we see that Allaah has made the ‚Äòiddah in the case of divorce of a girl who does not have periods ‚Äì because she is young and has not yet reached puberty ‚Äì three months. This clearly indicates that Allaah has made this a valid marriage.¬†
(b)It was narrated from ‚ÄòAa‚Äôishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married her when she was six years old, he consummated the marriage with her when she was nine and she stayed with him for nine years.
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4840; Muslim, 1422)¬†
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married ‚ÄòAa‚Äôishah when she was six years old and consummated the marriage when she was nine.‚Äù
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim; Muslim says ‚Äòseven years‚Äô)¬†


The masked Arab specifically says that the sentence ‚Äòalong with those who have it not‚Äô or ‚Äòand for those who have no course‚Äô (whatever translation you prefer) refers to young girls before puberty. And that‚Äôs a common Muslim interpretation. He didn‚Äôt make it up. He quotes several tafsirs directly and says that other tafsirs are of the same opinion: https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=74&amp;tSoraNo=65&amp;tAyahNo=4&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=2

This is another source directly quoted by the masked Arab. Do you even listen to what he says? But that‚Äôs the thing: you are accusing him of misquoting, when you are the one misquoting him!! You are just blinded. You have convinced yourself of the narrative that anyone who says something about Islam that you deem negative is spreading hateful lies, even if they are quoting Muslim scholars. You are unable and/or unwilling to engage with the material in good faith. At the 16:20 minute mark in the video a Muslim scholar specifically talksabout how prepubescent girls can get married. How is this a misrepresentation? To whom else is this passage referring to?
How should you handle the waiting period for remarriage with those, that as of yet did not have periods? You should wait three months, just like with the ones that no longer can have periods. That‚Äôs what the Quran says. What does that verse imply? According to Muslims scholars, it implies that if you can divorce someone, who hasn‚Äôt had her period yet, you can marry her as well!!! Because how can you divorce someone, who hasn‚Äôt had her period, before marrying her in the first place? Therefore it implies marriage to prepubescent girls!!!!
That‚Äôs exactly how Muslims scholars interpreted it over the centuries and it is quite the plausible interpretation.

&gt; Yes you're right Muslims have different views on that matter but all agree that you can never marry off a child

So you are clearly wrong: whether you agree with it from a moral or theological point or not, some Muslims(including scholars) truly believed over the centuries and until this day that you can marry off a young prepubescent girl. So many Muslims like the ones in Indonesia you mentioned may find child marriages abhorrent(and quite understandably so), but Islam is more than the subjective feelings of some Muslims. You see it at the end of the masked Arabs video, how many Muslims are disgusted by the Muslim scholars opinions on child marriages, but that begs the question of what constitutes Islam. Now you can make the case that your own subjective feelings matter and that you have to reinterpret Islam, but then you would cut yourself off form the way Islam was practiced for centuries. You can always find individual scholars that have a different opinion about anything really, but does that constitute Islam?  As far as child marriages are concerned or the age of Aisha, there has been consensus for centuries on these issues. Now of course you can argue against this consensus based on your scholarly opinions, but you should at least recognize that Muslims before you truly believed in these things and you should ask yourself, what motivates you to question this consensus. Do you truly care about what Islam is or isn‚Äôt, do you care about the truth or do you just wish to reinterpret and reimagine Islam in your own image, so that it becomes more palatable to you?

I don‚Äôt know much about Zakir Naik. He comes off as a buffoon really and is not really that respected among muslim scholars, I think. He‚Äôs more like a pop-muslim scholar, who knows how to self-advertise. But nevertheless: does he really try to find the truth about Aisha and her age or is he trying to come up with a different age for her, because otherwise it would make Muhammad look bad? I think that many Muslims are ashamed that their prophet married a young girl and therefore try to find ways to reinterpret her age, so that Muhammad does not look so bad in the eyes of a modern world with modern sensibilities. But if you search for the truth, the end result should always be undetermined and open. Otherwise your search will end where it started.

Now that‚Äôs it for me: if what I have written does not convince you, nothing will. I cannot waste my time restating what the masked Arab already said, to restate what his sources say, just because you refuse to engage them honestly. Even if you disagree with his sources or everything else he says, you should at least be able to present his opinions accurately, without any distortions. Otherwise you are lying to yourself.

This is not a public thing. Public thing = public institution (public school).

2905,"I think it's appropriate to post a copy pasta from the thread I've posted previously. Wit the permission of /u/haveyougoogle, here is a tweaked version of his old and short abstract explaining the day.

155 years ago, in 2 June 1864 (21 May 1864 by then Russian calendar), Russian Tsar Aleksandr II declared that the Russo-Circassian War, a series of war that started in 1763 - and lasted approximately 101 years and which was part of the Russian Empire's Caucasus conquest, had ended, and of course the occupation of Circassian land by Russian Empire. By quoting Walter Richmonds, in his description of the final conquest and expulsion of the Circassians in the 1860s, Russian officer Ivan Drozdov says this about the death and destruction that his army brought upon Circassians: ‚ÄúMankind has rarely experienced such disasters and to such extremes, but only horror could have an effect on the hostile mountaineers and drive them from the impenetrable mountain thickets.""

You highly probably haven't even heard of Circassia or a nation called Circassians, aside from them living in Europe or where they were and are living, and that's mostly because of the war and the consequences of the war for the once largest nation of North Caucasus, and one of the oldest national groups of Europe. Nation itself was actually pretty famous, from being the subject of the famous travellers and adventure books to being at the frontpages of the American newspapers, or being pointed by the Karl Marx, or from the fantasies of some Western painters about the pale white sex slaves to some pseudo-racist early anthropological classifications where the term Caucasian is still a reminder of: but just in a glimpse of a century, it turned into some unknown word excluding maybe at some paintings about the Ottoman harems and a type of wood, just as the country was destroyed and the population was decimated, and turned into some small isles in the very ancestral homeland or some national groups of other countries.

At the end of the war, victorious Russia approved Dmitry Milyutin's plan which was about ""not to simply move them so that their land could be settled by productive farmers, but rather that 'eliminating the Circassians was to be an end in itself - to cleanse the land of hostile elements'"". Milyutin became the War Minister then, and seen his plan being implemented. The practice was also about what the general field marshal Aleksandr Bariatinskii was saying, especially after the 1830-1840 period: ‚ÄúWe must assume that we will need to exterminate the mountaineers before they agree to our demands‚Äù.

Whole Circassian population in the historical Circassia was lowered to %5 of what it was by the early 1860s (also it should be noted that, even before the adaption of the Milyutin's plans in Kabarda/Eastern Circassia the population in 1790 which was around 300000 was dropped to 30000 just in 40 years), while during the 101 years long war which Circassians fought against the odds, many were murdered, whole villages were burned and destroyed, corps were destroyed and livestock were killed in order to starve the natives, and regions were surrounded in order to diseases like the plague to kill them all until to point that Russian forces can go in and finish the job (especially in the Kabarda/Eastern Circassia). Only between 1860-1865 at least 625 000 Circassians end up dead, according to both Epifantsev who is with a pro-Russian stance and describes the events as a great crime and inhumane but another chapter of imperial expansionism only, and Richmond who describes events as a genocide. Brutality of the Tsarist commanders were well-known, especially the general Aleksei Ermolov's, while aside from tactics including starving people or annihilating settlements, some figures like General Grigorii Zass furthered things to the point of harvesting Circassian heads and ""the heads of Circassians were constantly stuck on lances on a specially made hill at Prochny Okop, and their beards blew in the wind."" At the end, Circassians were given the choice between resettling to the other side of the river under the Cossack control where they would highly probably die off from the diseases, and left for the Ottoman Empire, while in practice only given option was to leave North Caucasus for the Ottoman Empire (and Iran) and all were driven to the shores of the Black Sea. While hundreds of thousands were forcibly deported, many died before making to the shores and while waiting for the ships where they were forced to shores without food or water by the Imperial Russian forces, and some were even left to the open land without clothing. With the ships arrived, overcrowded ships became tombs for the Circassian who were able to make to them, and a huge portion perished in the Black Sea. Things weren't good for the ones who made to the shores either, where a sizable amount of the survivors died in the places they landed. For example, a diplomat in Trabzon during the period writes ""so far 19000 of the 24700 people who landed to Trabzon has died. 200 of the 110000 refugees around the Samsun region are dying on the daily basis"". While numbers depends on the source, according to many, between 2 to 2.5 millions of Caucasian Mountaineers were expelled, while only around 1.5 million of them made to the shores, and only less than a million of them managed to survive. In 1879, the New York Times called the Circassians ‚Äúa Murdered Nation‚Äù.

Although the Circassians (and Ubykhs who were included in Circassians) and also Abkhazians and Abazas were the main victims, the expulsions also deeply affected other peoples in the Caucasus region. It was estimated that 80% of the Ingush left Ingushetia for the Middle East in 1865. Lowland Chechens as well were evicted in large numbers. The Arshtins were completely wiped out and became a little clan within the neighbouring Chechen nation. Also, small numbers of Muslim Ossetians and Lezgins were expelled as well.

Today 90% of people with Circassian descendent now live in other countries rather than their homeland. The depopulated Circassian lands were resettled by various ethnic groups, including Russians, Ukrainians and Georgians.

In 1990, the Circassians designated the 21st of May as the national Day of Mourning, as the anniversary of the Circassian genocide and exile committed as a part of the colonialist policies of the Tsarist Russia. Former Russian President Boris Yeltsin's May 1994 statement admitted that North Caucasian resistance to the tsarist forces was legitimate, but the current appeal notes that he did not recognize ""the guilt of the tsarist government for the genocide committed against the peoples of the North Caucasus"". Personally, like the vast majority of my nation, while I do count the events as a genocide, and while many Russians do say it was only a war crime, ethnic cleansing, imperial expansion or ""Americans did the same to the Native Americans and they say it isn't a genocide either"", I don't think the terminology is going to differ what has happened at the end. And let me remind that, current Russians are unrelated to these events, Russian Federation is also not responsible nor the legal successor of the Russian Empire. While of course there are some demands, which are about recognition of the crime, restoration of Circassia instead of the ongoing policy of dividing Circassians into some even non-existing subgroups and the shared-republic policies, and the right to repatriate to our ancestral and historical homeland (especially for the ones in the warzones, like Syrian Circassians), there isn't anybody holding current Russia responsible for anything.

For many times, heads of current Circassian Republics under Russian Federation, requested Duma to reconsider the situation request for and apology. But to date, there has been further moves from Russian Federation other than Sochi Olympics at year, also the 150th anniversary of genocide and exile, in the very city, where Circassians had surrendered in 1864. I really don't know why, Russia also chosen to hold skiing and related events and build the core of the Olympic infrastructure in Krasnaya Polyana, which was ""once known as Qbaada"" and ""settled by Russian immigrants and renamed Krasnaya Polyana (Red Meadow), a reference to all the blood spilled on the field during the final battle"". Sure that this wasn't ""cool"" at least, especially while there wasn't any mention of Circassians in the opening or the ending ceremony but more importantly, while Syrian Circassians were not able repatriate to their historical homeland from the brutal warzones.

Second, they get money, they spend money. On everything you buy, you gotta pay tax and also you buy something from german stores in the german economy. In the end you are giving this money to companies in germany as well as it is coming back to the state. Maybe you should check out how economy works.

Third, I don't really know how many are here right now. I do not check this everyday because I do not care. I live in the most densely populated area in germany and I have had hardly any contact with refugees. And even when I had it was not an unpleasant thing. Most of them are exactly this - refugees from a warzone and they want to go home. They are humans and not stinking rats that you want to exterminate. 

Yes this shit was not a ""good"" thing. We could've very well lived without it. But what do you want to do? Let people die at your borders? We sold the bad guys all the weapons. Where do you think all those weapons came from? The famous syrian weapon-factories? And why do you think shit was hitting the fan like this in Syria? Maybe the west played a certain role in destabilizing Iraq and did not really do a great job in keeping those fundamentalists in check? Maybe keeping them in check was not possible? Maybe Sadam Hussein was actually a better solution to keep those shits in check than bombing the living shit outta that country and suck all the oil out of it?

That again is something that is decided by courts, we had plenty of lawsuits for insults thrown out. 

Where the German legal system generally draws the line are the *legal* definitions of both dignity and honour.

""Dignity"" in this context generally refers to the first article of the German constitution, e.g. calling someone a cockroach or ethnic slurs would go in that direction.

""Honour"" in this context is for example used as the basis for insults: To have your *legal* honour hit in a way that allows the law to intervene an insult must be intended to make another person seem like they're worth less on an ethical or social level than they actually are.

What makes this complicated when it comes to actual legal action is that *context* is valued highly.

3038,"**Paywall:**

Nigel Farage appears to have drawn strength from a recent encounter with a milkshake; to the leader of the Brexit party, the salted caramel and banana drink hurled over him in Newcastle is a symbol of an increasingly desperate establishment plot to stop him.

Mr Farage strides on to the stage in front of more than 1,000 supporters in the Lancashire town of Bolton with chants of ‚ÄúNigel, Nigel, Nigel‚Äù ringing around the hall. ‚ÄúThe establishment aren‚Äôt scared of us,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre terrified of us.‚Äù

The milkshake incident, he tells his followers, is a symptom of the ‚Äúradicalisation‚Äù of those who want to remain in the EU. He identifies his enemy as an elite that casts itself as ‚Äúmorally superior‚Äù to the 17.4m who backed Brexit in 2016.

But it is the 55-year-old, one of the most divisive figures in British political life, who depicts himself as holding the moral high ground, as he channels voter frustration over the delay of Brexit into a formidable lead for his party ahead of Thursday‚Äôs European Parliament elections.

Less than six weeks after the Brexit party‚Äôs foundation, it is now consistently polling over 30 per cent for the EU race ‚Äî more than the opposition Labour party and ruling Conservatives combined in some surveys. Such a result could return almost 30 MEPs to Strasbourg, while breathing down the neck of the next Tory prime minister to deliver a hard Brexit.

Mr Farage, who was accused of debasing political debate and stirring up anti-immigrant feeling in the 2016 EU referendum, says he looks forward to seeing the Conservative vote ‚Äúobliterated‚Äù. Theresa May‚Äôs bedraggled ruling party is struggling to hit double figures as Tory voters ‚Äî and even officials ‚Äî defect en masse to the Brexit party, at least for this week‚Äôs EU vote.

It is an astonishing comeback for a man who bowed out of politics after the 2016 poll, as the UK Independence party, which he led three times, drifted towards the rightwing fringe of politics.

David Cameron, the former Tory prime minister, thought he could stop Mr Farage by offering the EU referendum. Three years later, Mr Farage has been drawing big crowds on a cross-country tour ‚Äî in contrast with Mrs May‚Äôs election launch, which was so low-key some compared the candidates on stage to participants in a hostage video.

The privately educated former City commodities broker is acclaimed as he delivers his anti-establishment tirade to audiences wholly unperturbed by recent reports of a lavish lifestyle funded by a ¬£450,000 gift from his friend, the insurance tycoon Arron Banks.

Before arriving in Bolton, north-west England, Mr Farage‚Äôs bus rolls into Wakefield in Yorkshire, where locals have gathered in front of the cathedral to greet him. One man looks slightly sheepish and, initially refusing to give his name, reveals that his two companions are local Conservative councillors.

After only modest persuasion, he reveals that he is Tony Homewood, deputy chairman of Wakefield Conservatives, and that he has already cast a postal vote for the Brexit party. ‚ÄúI want to leave the EU and have wanted to leave the EU for some time.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe result should have been delivered,‚Äù says Chad Thomas, a 28-year-old who has turned up to watch the event, referring to the 2016 Leave vote. ‚ÄúIf May and [Labour leader] Jeremy Corbyn had sorted it out, Farage would have been on the beach by now. Brexit is never going to go away.‚Äù

Lydia Seetulboseea, born in France and whose surname comes from a Mauritian husband, says she is tired of Brexiters being labelled as racists. A pensioner, she said she had given ¬£375 to the Brexit party. More than 100,000 people have paid ¬£25 to become registered supporters.

The success of the party in mobilising an army of grassroots supporters has created ‚Äújealousy‚Äù from an establishment that wants to crush it, according to Mr Farage, speaking to the Financial Times from inside his campaign bus, the window blacked out by a piece of cardboard.

He says the establishment is now trying to discredit the Brexit party by suggesting it has taken donations in foreign currencies, an idea promoted by former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, taken up by the BBC and then investigated by the Electoral Commission, the elections watchdog.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs direct political interference in an election campaign,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an establishment stitch-up. It‚Äôs an outrage.‚Äù He denies any wrongdoing.

The sense that ‚Äúthey‚Äù will do anything to stop Mr Farage getting his way on Brexit is a recurring theme as he wraps up the day with his rally in Bolton.

Mr Farage‚Äôs cast-list of establishment villains is eclectic. The BBC is named. ‚ÄúBoo,‚Äù say the crowd. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader? ‚ÄúBooo,‚Äù says the crowd. What about Anna Soubry, the pro-Remain former Tory and now in the new party Change UK? ‚ÄúBooooo.‚Äù

The Brexit party‚Äôs critics sometimes depict it as a get-together of geriatrics uncomfortable with today‚Äôs world. But young families and students cheer Mr Farage on at his Bolton rally. 

He warns that if Brexit is not delivered then Britain would ‚Äúcease to be a functioning democratic society‚Äù. The European Parliament elections may only be the beginning for the new party. Mr Farage intends to field candidates at the next general election, which could take place as early as this year.

‚ÄúThe two-party system serves nothing but itself,‚Äù he says. Conservatives and Labour contemplate Thursday‚Äôs poll and shudder.",,/r/europe/comments/brbqt9/how_nigel_farage_took_european_elections_by_storm/eoc5fg8/,ShortTrifle0,1558453275

3041,"&gt;Most Muslims in turkey follow the Hanafi branch of sunni-Islam jurisprudence, not Sufism

Do you know the difference between an Islamic school and an Islamic sect?

No you don't 

Sufism is a sect and the Hanafi schools is a.. well school of thought...

That's the first thing 

Second thing, try to go and ask multiple Muslim Turks whether they follow the Hanafi school or not, they probably won't even know what you're talking about.


&gt;As far as I know all branches of sunni-Islam and Shia-Islam set the minimum age of marriage at 9 years.

Then you know nothing lol.. every shitty country like Saudi Arabia or Iran doesn't have a minimum age but rather waiting for the first period of the girl is their (you're now a woman) mark..

I'm not even saying that's Islamically acceptable btw 
But that's another topic

3216,"Exactly this. Batteries are way too expensive to store energy if you only use them infrequently.

Example: Let's say a battery costs 100‚Ç¨ per kWh of storage capacity. Also let's assume that they have a lifetime of 20 years ( Car batteries usually have a 10 year warranty)

Also let's say that you completely fill and drain the battery once every day. With this we can calculate the price of storing the energy:

100‚Ç¨ / (20years\*365days) = \~1,4 cents. That's a reasonable price. But it goes downhill fast if you use them less often.

Use a full cycle (fill and drain) only every week = 9,6 cents. That's still a reasonable price, but already expensive.

Full cycle every 4 weeks: 38 cents. Storage of energy now has become more expensive than production, transmission and tax combine. This is no longer economically feasible.

And now you need to remember that we also want to supply enough electricity during the 1% day in the year in winter, when heating of private houses has doubled the required electricity (as it does in France) while the sun is low on the horizon and the wind is calm.

So you can reach 50% and 80% renewables via battery backup rather easily, but going 90% is expensive and 99% is impossible.

Which is why the only chance i see to go 100% renewable (and i include nuclear in this) is if we have an efficient Carbon Capture and Utilization system, where we can convert surplus electricity in summer into a fuel to use in winter when the demand is highest.

Interestingly, if this happens, then the electric cars will only have been a short fad and fizzle out. (In Germany, the electricity required to drive 100km has the same price as the diesel required. Our government has to seriously turn to tax wheels somewhat to make electric cars, even with the added battery costs, cheaper than conventional fuel cars.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/br3ptw/german_storage_system_proves_batteries_profitable/eobanpl/,Alcobob,1558438571

3260,"&gt; Striking a lot is not a sign of strength, its a sign you can't get deals without doing that.

That can have a number of causes though, sure one is that unions don't have the strength to negotiate, but another one is that unions don't want to negotiate. If a union gets the feeling that by forcing a company to the brink of bankruptcy they can get exactly what they want without compromise then why would they negotiate?

The strength of unions in France isn't related to the unionization rate, French law gives them statutory powers to represent all workers whether or not they are a part of the union in all companies with over 50 employees and in these cases they also have powers unrivalled elsewhere: they must for example even be consulted if the office furniture is reorganised! The unionization rate is low because the members are represented by the union whether they pay or not.

It seems to me therefore to be more likely that with all these powers the unions can't negotiate, and more likely that they see more power in not negotiating until they have forced the company into a more desperate position where it is more likely to have to give into their demands.",,/r/europe/comments/br6jze/italian_unions_refuse_to_load_saudi_ship_in/eobbbv6/,crimpers,1558438944

That becomes even worse if you produce gas from renewable electricity (which costs more than 10p per KWH) because the efficiency is low, and you also have to pay for the plant to convert electricity into gas. You'd end up with gas with a wholesale cost 10 - 15 times as much as the current price of natural gas, and very few people could afford to use that for heating.

Electric heating can be made more efficient, heat pumps are competitive on running costs with gas because they are so efficient.

Additionally the black market offers fully automatic rifles. For a person with the intention to commit acts of violence there is simply no reason to go through the process of acquiring legal firearms. 

Considering this, we can safely assume that without first addressing the flow from the Balkans, any further regulation of legal firearms will have no measurable effect on illicit use of firearms.

Hey at least you admit you're generalizing right?

&amp;#x200B;

But let's still cuss out every right winger because right = evil.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; There is a difference between pointing out the trouble immigration  brings with it, and these are valid points, and outright hate campaigns,  insults and fear mongering towards this subject. Again, the right wing  constnatly uses emotions to solve these problems, not constructive  debate in how for example integreation can be managed. Just look at some  of the campaign posters used by the right in regards to immigration and  tell me it is not outright racism here. If the right wing would tone  down this issue and actually worked on solutions, this would by far not  be the problem it is right now. 

And you're ignoring the right wingers that raise concerns instead of ""spreading fear"" once again. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Again, compltely misrepresenting that it is the EU ""nations"" having the  last word in the EU, supported by the elected governments in each  country. Austria and other countries in the EU carried those descisions,  so if you want to blame someone, look at your own governments.

Firstly, you could say that a system like this can only be designed by highly educated people, but the oversight can be dumbed down so that most people can do the basic level of oversight. Secondly, since when is ""highly educated"" not something that should be aspired to? I would hope that the people designing voting systems are highly educated, and not a random plumber or farmer pulled from the streets.

&gt; Few or no human checks, I don't trust software being ever good enough to not have them.

There are many, many more examples of paper ballots being tampered with (on any scale) than digital voting. That YOU don't trust a digital system doesn't mean it is worse than the existing status quo. It is all about facilitating the right and opportunity to vote to as many people as possible. Nothing is perfect after all, but we should strive for the best.

&gt;While with paper ballots you have multiple concurrent checks done by people.

Firstly, with digital ballots you can do even better - physical checks on random ballots by real persons, but even better you can in real time monitor if there is anything strange happening. Again, as long as the overseers are uncorrupted, this is securable. if the overseers are corrupted, it doesn't matter what kind of ballot you use.

&gt; Monitoring of the paper process is easy enough to be done by most (if not all) people.

Changing, destroying or double voting is also easier with paper ballots for the normal populous. It requires a lot more knowledge to change algorithms, security breaches and coding to change a digital ballot compared to 2 or 3 people conspiring to count wrong, destroy ballots before them leaving the local polling station or any other of the proven douzens of election tampering that have happened in the past",Bucharest - expat,/r/europe/comments/bqrq70/romania_loves_europe/eoapdeb/,sir_roderik,1558424079

3424,"&gt;there is a big difference between ""supporting mass muslim immigration"" and being open to inclusion and ready to accept new people

With 40 years of integration, we still see the same patterns happening in generation after generation. Do you see how counterproductive that form of immigration is? Sure there is no way to deny all migration, but you can restrict it as much as possible, or as an alternative screw over the lower class even more by lowering social benefits, making the western countries less attractive. Sounds bad because it is, but thanks to immigration they get shafted the most anyway, they have to live in the same neighborhoods and have to compete for the same jobs as immigrants. Weird that even though I live in a expensive neighborhood in a city, I can still empathize with the people who have to live in this mess.

&gt;Both laws that protect your religious freedom and ones that protect the rights of the LGBT community. It would be ridiculous if we cant figure out a way that the two can coexist, thats a common leftist position. 

Religious freedom should be removed and everyone should fall under freedom of speech. I don't see a reason to keep a protective class alive that can spout their subhuman ideologies just because they have more 'freedoms' then ordinary people.

3443,"The UK is and has always been a fanatic supporter of Turkey. British and Turkish interests have almost always come into collusion even during WW1 when they were allegedly on opposite sides. 

However specific to Cyprus it comes down to this:

* The British promised Cyprus to Greece a plethora of times, something that was even encouraged by the US. They never made good on their promise, and it made the Greek population harder to control. 
* The British have always wanted to control trade in the Mediterranean and view Cyprus as an indispensable, unsinkable aircraft carrier in the Eastern-Med. All of their Middle-Eastern operations are conducted out of the bases in Akrotiri and Dhekelia and it was crucial for maintaining their access to Suez. 
* Turkey had relinquished any claim on Cyprus back in the 1930s-1940s and were actively encouraging Turks to come back to Turkey as they had done in other parts of the former Ottoman Empire. The British needed to get them interested in Cyprus again because it gave them an excuse to control the island. If there is no Turkish claim on the island, eventually the Greeks would have forced union to Greece. Greek Cypriots managed to force independence and that was *after* the UK got Turkey involved. With no Turkey involved, 100% Cyprus joins Greece like Crete does. 
* When the Republic of Cyprus got independence from the UK, and I should say, ""independence"", the Cypriot government was non-aligned and the UK felt they were unpredictable in their policy. Having Turkey invade was useful because. the UK presence was justified. 
* Fast forward today, if there is a solution to the Cyprus problem today, the Cypriot government will 100% petition for the removal of the British bases.

3645,"&gt;In his interviews, he speaks carefully and strains to distance himself from the rough, historical image of right-wing extremism. Sellner refers to the Identitarians as a ‚Äúpatriotic Greenpeace.‚Äù Among his role models, he¬†cites the leaders of the White Rose movement, a group of anti-Nazi activists and intellectuals who resisted dictator Adolf Hitler. Given these influences, it‚Äôs unsurprising that the Identitarians have adopted protest methods from environmentalists and the leftist movement of the 1960s.

&gt;Sellner now claims he‚Äôs broken with his Neo-Nazi past and says Nazism‚Äôs popularity amongst young people is a failure of society. He insists that the Identitarians are different.

&gt;‚ÄúAnyone who reads our texts and looks at our actions sees that we draw a line between ourselves and the extreme right in both content and attitude. We affirm our democracy,‚Äù Sellner says.

&gt;‚ÄúOur position expresses the fundamental feelings of an entire generation, a whole era even,‚Äù Sellner asserts.

not relevant here, and it certainly does make germany guilty of warcrimes.

&gt;Germany didn't orchestrate the revolution but merely took advantage of it. Besides, that revolution significantly improved life for most Russians.

they literally imported lenin into the country o stur up trouble, also define better sure in the long run the SU did do great things but the reality is that democratic russia likely would have achieved the same.

&gt;Which caused France and the UK to immediately develop and use their own poison gases. Such good guys.

being first kinda makes yo the bad guy.

&gt;The UK dropped a lot more bombs on Germany than Germany dropped on the UK.

source needed, we are talking about ww 1, military targets including airship bases are not the same as attacking london.

&gt;Yeah, because the Entente kept transporting war munitions on civilian vessels and used Q-ships to bait submarines into surfacing. The idea that submarines were supposed to surface before attacking a ship was ridiculous anyway.

doesn't excuse attacking neutral countries shipping, the fact germany was afraid several countries would join the entente as a result of it kinda makes it clear they themselves didnt think it was a great idea and it certainly did not make them look good.

Germany (23%), Italy (18%), France (14%), Spain (13%) and the United Kingdom (8%) accounted for three quarters of all valid residence permits granted to non-EU citizens.

The stock of valid residence permits issued to non-EU citizens rose by 5% between the end of 2016 and the end of 2017. The majority (21) of EU Member States reported an increasing number of valid permits.

The highest rate of increase was recorded in Hungary, where the stock of permits granted to non-EU citizens more than doubled (113%), followed by Bulgaria (41%), Malta (25%) and Slovakia (21%).

Among the five Member States with the largest stocks of resident permits, Germany recorded the highest increase, as the number of valid permits rose by 14% between the end of 2016 and the end of 2017. Increases were also recorded in France, Spain and the United Kingdom. In this group only Italy recorded a reduction in the stock of valid permits (-3%). Among all Member States there were five other countries reporting a decline: Estonia, Czechia, Latvia, Greece and Romania.

3665,"&gt;That said, I do have a lot of trouble understanding why people in democratic nations are ok with any kind of speech restriction, even free speech. I just can't comprehend it.

Two major things:

1) The basic belief that actions don't usually happen in isolation with no precursors. Physical altercations with no other communication beforehand aren't the norm. And, to bring up up an event that Americans never witnessed on their continent, millions of people weren't killed in an industrialized manner from one day to another - years of propaganda and ""just some harmless speech"" came before that. Violence escalates and speech in general as well as propaganda specifically plays a role in that escalation.

2) A different understanding of what 'freedom' means. In the US, I would be free to show people the finger (almost) as often as I'd like. In Germany for example I have the freedom to go to the police if crap like that annoys me enough.

Laws in that regard aim to assure a basic level of human interaction in a society as a whole. The US approach on the contrary puts individual freedoms above society in this regard.

&gt;Hate speech can be easily redefined under the current legal paradigm. It is based on subjective definitions of what hate is. I don't even know why the government is allowed to have the power to define hate in regards to ideas.

That portion shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how European speech laws usually work. ""Hate-speech"" is not a legal concept in Germany for example, there's a reason the official translation for that law in particular is [incitement to hatred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksverhetzung):

&gt;For any hate speech to be punishable as Volksverhetzung, the law requires that said speech be ""qualified for disturbing public peace"" either by inciting ""hatred against parts of the populace"" or calling for ""acts of violence or despotism against them"", or by attacking ""the human dignity of others by reviling, maliciously making contemptible or slandering parts of the populace"".

Of note is that this is *extremely close* to the interpretation of ""freedom of speech"" in the US around the 1940s. [This 9-0 SCOTUS opinion in Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_words#United_States) could (almost) have been written by a German judge today. Germany learned her attitude towards freedom of expression from you guys, combined with the experiences of WW2 and the Weimar Republic.

Part of what makes this work (and which I've found based on experience is usually tricky to grasp for most non-Germans because the concept is unique) is something that likely sounds incredibly vague to you such as ""attacking the human dignity of others"" is a rather well defined *legal* concept in Germany, not just some random ""feel-y thing"" that can change in an instant - after all the first article of our constitution is that:

Nowhere near as bad as what Belgium did in the Congo. Does that make Germany the good guys? No. Does it make Belgium the good guys? Hell no.

Yeah, because the Entente kept transporting war munitions on civilian vessels and used Q-ships to bait submarines into surfacing. The idea that submarines were supposed to surface before attacking a ship was ridiculous anyway.

3729,"&gt; Did you verify your own assertion based on a UK Tabloid known for spewing lies

Again, you corroborated the evidence that came from &lt;the sun&gt; rather easily, but no, I did not use them as a source for my previous allegation. To be honest, I spoke offhand and based on my assumptions and understanding of news articles I've seen in the past, so I do apologize for that.

To further this point, however, it was articles [such as this](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42557828) and others which claimed that 'crime in Germany was going underreported' specifically to further the agenda of accepting more refugees/normalizing their presence. That much was actually intimated by Trump and I've come to trust him as he does point out legitimate issues and with a far higher security clearance than other officials. I'm sure you could argue it's an attempt to destabilize, but the way I see it, if the refugees ARE a problem (as we can see in other countries, again, in France), and Germany DOES have an agenda which involves protecting the refugees from criticism, they directly stand to gain from underreporting crime.

I also factored in the apparent inability of European law enforcement and media to [admit the motives of their criminals](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-belgium-stabbing-idUSKCN1NP0MB)

I believe Sweden is also a heavily contested subject over whether they are underreporting, as well. The Danes and Norwegians I see on the forums always make fun of them over it =p That being said, just hearsay.

&gt; 875 acts of vandalism does not equate 875 ""attacks"", and it's very interesting to note that these acts of vandalism also include swastika graffitis

Neo-nazis have existed for a bit over half a century now, while France's statistic of 2.4 attacks (def: a belligerent or antagonistic action- it does sound sensational, but is accurate) per day (875 yearly) have not.

&gt; Just google ""France 875 churches"", and the amount of results speaks as much an obvious language as how they twist the truth.

I mean, yes, Google does a very good job of censoring news articles (=p), but there's plenty there from different sources that don't have an interest in covering up crimes which all report that the number of incidents committed against French churches is actually factual. We have no way of knowing, personally, the exact number of Neo-Nazi attacks, right-wing attacks, left-wing attacks, or refugee attacks, but only one group in that entire list has an actual (religious, no less) motivation for doing so, and they have proven they are willing to act on it/celebrate destruction if the frequent acts of terrorism/[Notre Dame reaction](https://imgur.com/7SP3K3W) wasn't evidence enough of that.

&gt;  Separate the bad from the good instead of just putting a convenient label on the entire group.

How can you do that without waiting for more damage to occur? If we could read people's minds, sure, but you are only inviting your own destruction by waiting. You send them out, yet know there are still bad elements among them. Not only that, but you call for taking on more refugees, which means even more to sort through. While it sounds noble, it's what your law enforcement has been doing already, and it doesn't seem to be working from my perspective, all for reasons I listed prior.

&gt;  the court has no authority to decide this.

I will concede your points over the Armenian genocide. That being said, I don't sit well with your assertion that Jewish holocaust denial holds a greater prosecutorial basis simply because they are deemed to be threatened by antisemitism. In this alone, we're back to selective interpretation and different rights for different groups which all presents too many variables to a court setting which is supposed to be impartial.

&gt; they are by and large actually just satisfied and would even oppose an armed uprising

Now it's my turn to ask you how this makes sense! The French are so *dissatisfied* that they are willing to put on a yellow vest every bloody weekend for 27 straight weeks while also randomly protesting on select holidays/events. How is it not complacency that they are *satisfied* with the utter lack of compensation they have received?

&gt; Might as well ask why there's no uprising in the US yet, the situation there certainly seems more polarized and volatile than over here.

Trump is our revolution :v)

&gt; Did you link the wrong story? Either way, I'm fairly certain that an ""abortion"" of already-born children would constitute murder

No, and that's just the thing. The article clearly states that a baby can be killed at any time during a pregnancy up until the very moment of birth if the baby is deemed to endanger the mother's life. We're talking about legalizing the killing of a fully developed baby that's literally seconds away from taking its first breaths. If we perform a C-section or determine halfway through normal delivery and the mother deems her health is at risk for whatever reason, she's perfectly in her rights to kill the child. 

Now consider the fact that [a no-strings-attached, no-nonsense bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/311/text) was put through Congress which would establish rights for a newborn child and explicitly deny mothers the right to kill a child after a successful birth- we're talking all the way out of the womb and in a doctor's hands now, placed on a table, whatever- and [almost every single leftist democrat voted against it](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=116&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00027#top). There's no justifying that.

&gt; Here is a video of the incident, by the way. I think we both know how this might have turned out at an US school.

Interestingly enough, someone made a post on that video which [linked to a knife attack](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/stabbings-reported-pennsylvania-high-school-article-1.1750425) that didn't involve a mentally ill elderly person.

That being said, proponents of gun control are completely overblowing the situation in the US and are trying, specifically, to make gun ownership look unpalatable. The facts are that [an average of 30000 people die anually to gun-related violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States). That's a big number, right? Now consider that around 20000 of those deaths were actually due to suicide, which would occur regardless of gun ownership (I give an added plus to firearms here as other methods of suicide tend to be.. unreliable or gruesome, at best). This leaves 10000 deaths anually to firearm related violence. Of the 10000 remaining, about a tenth of that is due to lawful engagement by police officers in the line of duty. Another tenth is due primarily because of gang violence or part of drug trafficking operations. A much smaller fraction happens because of firearms negligence or accidental discharge.

In all, we're looking at less than 8000 deaths anually to firearms related discharge, which may still seem like a large number (even considering the US population is estimated at around 331,195,364, meaning less than 0.000025% of our population dies annually to gun-related crime) but let's consider some more entertaining (or morbidly entertaining, I suppose) facts, shall we?

According to some health websites, [preventable medical errors are responsible for 250000 deaths annually in the US.](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/05/03/476636183/death-certificates-undercount-toll-of-medical-errors)

[The common influenza virus is responsible for 12000 to 80000 deaths annually.](https://www.statnews.com/2018/09/26/cdc-us-flu-deaths-winter/)

[About 30000 die to fatal traffic incidents annually.](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/state-by-state)

[About 60000 die to drug overdose annually.](https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates)

I could go on, but the point is clear: gun violence is VASTLY overblown. I shouldn't need to say more when you consider the article I linked in my previous post which proved that outside sources were kidnapping children and specifically instructing them to be able to shoot up schools. It's a political ploy.

A disarmed populace is a controlled populace, and again, hitting back to my entire argument thus far, your government wants you to empower them. They want you to submit. They'll take everything, and it's only a matter of time.

&gt; Have you tried making this argument to...

Many of those instances you listed would not react well no matter how you approached the situation. Again, free speech does not ALWAYS lead to kids killing themselves. Have you tried asking US parents with kids who have been bullied to death whether they want restrictions on free speech? Many would shut you down simply on the principles we've been raised on. I'm sure all they care about is justice.

&gt; Just don't take your information from Breitbart or Infowars or Fox.

And here you were earlier telling me the right's all about shutting down the voice of the media. You know something, I've seen infowars at its worst. I remember a time when Alex Jones had complete say over the majority of what was published and all he ever covered was how Angelina Jolie was the center of the New World Order. All that is said, but even so, they've turned around recently and still provide facts-based news. They CAN be truthful. What doesn't make logical sense is to shut them out completely as a solution. If we shut out every source of news because they were wrong once, a couple times, multiple, then we wouldn't have any sources left to deal with. What amuses me is the fact check sites who use that same logic: this site is sensationalist because of XYZ article therefore you should ignore their opinions completely.

3883,"&gt; You are not being honest here. There is no scenario in which Germany defeats France, Britain, and the United States.

Not entirely true. It was entirely possible for the Schlieffen-Plan to succeed, in which case France would be out of the picture by the end of 1914. At that time neither the UK nor the US had introduced conscription. Of course Germany couldn't have invaded the UK, but that was never the goal. And the US only entered the war because of the German unrestricted submarine warfare, which in turn was brought about by the blockade.

&gt; Congress approved funding for Michigan and South Carolina in 1905, the same year that Dreadnought was laid down.

Right, but at that point it hadn't yet been determined that they would be built as dreadnoughts. The all big gun design was approved in 1906.

&gt; Finally, you keep ignoring the point that the rise of dreadnoughts hurt, above all, Britain. Britain's huge lead in ships up until that point was made almost irrelevant. 

I agree with this point. I wasn't ignoring it, it simply hadn't been made.

I can see both sides, though. The idea, I believe, was that the UK had a larger industrial output than Germany and could also spend a larger fraction of their resources on the navy, so they were never in a position where Germany could build more ships. On the other hand, if the UK delayed building dreadnoughts while Germany started building theirs, there might be a short time frame when the German Navy could go toe to toe with a numerically superior British Navy, and that's something the Admiralty wanted to avoid at all cost.

I mean, could you imagine something like the Battle of the Skagerrak where Germany has dreadnoughts and the UK doesn't? That could have been disastrous.",Basel-Stadt (Switzerland),/r/europe/comments/bqrsrj/above_the_clouds_of_war_switzerland_1914/eo9p5m1/,And_G,1558396858

3894,"It may be difficult to find a source that is not in German, I will try in the morning. In the meantime, here is an article from DerStandard, a left-liberal newspaper, that deals with the question ‚ÄúAre you allowed to call Heinz-Christian Strache a Ex-Neonazi‚Äù to which the article comes to the conclusion (with the help of two lawyers) that yes, you can rightfully call Strache an Ex-Neonazi even though he denies ever having been one. 

The thing is, Strache‚Äôs closeness with right extremist and fascist groups in his youth is well documented and he doesn‚Äôt deny it either. He just says he was a ‚ÄúSearcher‚Äù who looked at a lot. 

The relevant passage, translated through deepl: 

The ""factual substrate"" is a series of well-documented contacts between Strache and the right-wing radical and neo-Nazi scene in Austria in the 1980s.  The head of the FP√ñ does not deny any of this, but presents everything as harmlessly as possible:  Paramilitary military sports exercises with neo-Nazis in the Lower Austrian forest, in which the scene prepared itself for civil war-like conflicts, are in retrospect only ""Gotcha"" or ""paintball games"" for Strache.  Later, he said that he had found the war games with rifles and batons and the people involved horrible and had broken off the visit.

A ""seeker"" in Nazi circles

Strache told the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) that he was ""a seeker"" at the time, and that the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) extensively described the extreme right-wing past of the FP√ñ boss in a dossier: ""I looked at a lot of things.  Much right, mind you.  Norbert Burger, then a leader figure among Austria's right-wing extremists, played a central role in Strache's slide into the neo-Nazi milieu.  The young Strache was very close to Burger, was with his daughter and spent a lot of time with his family.

Again and again, the seeker comes into contact with the right edge - for example when camping in Carinthia:  Strache told the SZ that the camps had been organized by the ""Familienkreis Volkstreue Jugend"" and admitted that the SZ was in contact with the German Viking Youth.  The latter saw itself as the successor organization to the Hitler Youth and was banned in 1994.

Arrest in Fulda

On New Year's Eve 1989, the then 20-year-old was temporarily arrested in Fulda, Germany, to establish his identity:  Strache took part in the traditional ""warning fire"" of the Viking youth at the then still secured border to the communist GDR.  He later explained to the SZ that he had only learned of the organization's neo-Nazi attitude afterwards.

For Andreas Peham, an expert on right-wing extremism at the Documentation Archive of the Austrian Resistance (D√ñW), Straches' distancing from neo-Nazism ""would be even more credible if it were a little more honest"".  The appeasement and trivialisation in combination with distancing ""from something he never wanted to be anyway"" does not help to dispel doubts, Peham says to STANDARD.  Strache was ""not just anyone"" in the right-wing extremist scene in the 1980s simply because of his close relationship to Norbert Burger.

What people?   

&gt;Poland promised to certain uses of former Jewish heirless property that was ceized by the state  

When the IIWW began, Poland was occupied by the German Nazis and Russian communists. The greater part of Poland was occupied by communists. The Poles fought on all fronts with the Nazis. The Poles fought in Africa, Western Europe, the UK and the Eastern Front. The Polish army was 4 in the criterion of the number of soldiers. Unfortunately, Poland was sold to Stalin by the Allies at a conference in Yalta. Poland was sold to the communists.
Communists from USSR and their local collaborators led terror in Polish land.
After the war the communist government consisted of traitors and communists collaborators - in this case the nationalisation law was lead by Hilary Minc - he was of Jewish orign.

It was more brutal than other countries at the time but definitely not evil, which is a silly term to begin with. It's not like other countries would have hasitated putting down a revolution by any means necessary. Britain had no problem putting down the Irish rebellion in 1916, the French elite had no problem blodying their hands to destroy the Paris Commune and the Habsburgs were particuarly ruthless to all those who rebelled in 1848 and the only reason they relented and threw a bone to the Hungarians was because after they lost a war with Prussia 1866 and Italy, they feared that the Hungarians would rise again which would have meant the end of their already unstable patchwork empire.

Was Russia brutal to its own citizens? Of course. Does it make it ""evil""? Imo no.

2. Countries can sign treaties that that take precedence over standard UNCLOS provisions. Cyprus has already did that with Egypt, Israel and Lebanon. Cyprus FM has said many times that Cyprus invited Turkey to discuss the delimitation of EEZ but since Turkey does not recognises RoC nor accepts UNCLOS it refuses to do so.

4025,"Harder working ? lol. 

What are you basing your statement on ?

Is it time spend working ? Is it pay you take home ? Is it actual hardship of the work ? Is it GDP per capita ? 

You will find that for the most part, the harder physical work gets paid less. 

Time spent at work doesn't differ that much between countries and it also doesn't say much about productivity. At the same time, the more you can have your work automated or outsourced to a country with low wages, the more productive you become. 

As for the pay you take home, it is linked to many factors: education, line of business, customer base ... 
So a doctor would earn more than a truck-driver, because of his higher education needed to perform his job. Yet at the same time a german doctor earns more in Germany than a romanian doctor earns in Romania, simply because their patients have a very different financial situation.

Now, GDP per capita is my favourite to debunk. Coming from Luxembourg, we have one of the highest GDP per capita in the world. I hope you agree that we're not working that much harder than most other EU countries ... 
I mean, we do work 40h/week, but that doesn't explain it. It's more that we have specialized in finance and finance related activities ... a bit like the city of London or Frankfurt or Paris. Luxembourg just happens to be very small, so the financial windfall from those high value activities affects not just a city, but the whole country.",Europe's best: Luxembourg,/r/europe/comments/bqrq70/romania_loves_europe/eo93byk/,Jill_X,1558381131

Healthcare is mostly accepted here by right wing parties because people like it. Like in the US, where increasingly Republicans are growing weary of repealing Obamacare because it has popular support. Still, there are politicians defending partial or full privatization of the healthcare system. And I don't doubt they would do it if the people opinions shifts enough to not be political suicide.

Socialism as a word doesn't mean much around here, but Socialism as a policy is shunned by the vast majority of the people and even yesterday there were politicians accusing the government of basically wanting to restart the PREC (basically a period were a communist revolution was being put in place) because they are in a confidence and supply agreement with the leftmost parties.

&gt;It is now but it's spreading quickly (see the video of the link), that's why Germany needs the introduction of new laws severe enough to cut off any kind of totalitarian ideology like Salafism, better to prevent now that to have to deal with a big problem in the future.

https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2013/06/28/the-nsa-and-cias-dilemma/view-all/

&gt;Despite these concerns the US has continued to expand ECHELON surveillance in Europe, partly because of heightened interest in commercial espionage ‚Äì to uncover industrial information that would provide American corporations with an advantage over foreign rivals.

&gt;German security experts discovered several years ago that ECHELON was engaged in heavy commercial spying in Europe. Victims included such German firms as the wind generator manufacturer Enercon. In 1998, Enercon developed what it thought was a secret invention, enabling it to generate electricity from wind power at a far cheaper rate than before. However, when the company tried to market its invention in the United States, it was confronted by its American rival, Kenetech, which announced that it had already patented a near-identical development. Kenetech then brought a court order against Enercon to ban the sale of its equipment in the US. In a rare public disclosure, an NSA employee, who refused to be named, agreed to appear in silhouette on German television to reveal how he had stolen Enercon‚Äôs secrets by tapping the telephone and computer link lines that ran between Enercon‚Äôs research laboratory and its production unit some 12 miles away. Detailed plans of the company‚Äôs invention were then passed on to Kenetech.

&gt;In 1994, Thomson S.A., located in Paris, and Airbus Industrie, based in Blagnac Cedex, France, also lost lucrative contracts, snatched away by American rivals aided by information covertly collected by NSA and CIA. The same agencies also eavesdropped on Japanese representatives during negotiations with the United States in 1995 over auto parts trade.

&gt;German industry has complained that it is in a particularly vulnerable position because the government forbids its security services from conducting similar industrial espionage. ‚ÄúGerman politicians still support the rather naive idea that political allies should not spy on each other‚Äôs businesses. The Americans and the British do not have such illusions,‚Äù said journalist Udo Ulfkotte, a specialist in European industrial espionage, in 1999.

&gt;That same year, Germany demanded that the United States recall three CIA operatives for their activities in Germany involving economic espionage. The news report stated that the Germans ‚Äúhave long been suspicious of the eavesdropping capabilities of the enormous U.S. radar and communications complex at Bad Aibling, near Munich‚Äù, which is in fact an NSA intercept station. ‚ÄúThe Americans tell us it is used solely to monitor communications by potential enemies, but how can we be entirely sure that they are not picking up pieces of information that we think should remain completely secret?‚Äù asked a senior German official. Japanese officials most likely have been told a similar story by Washington about the more than a dozen signals intelligence bases which Japan has allowed to be located on its territory.

&gt;In their quest to gain access to more and more private information, the NSA, the FBI, and other components of the US national security establishment have been engaged for years in a campaign to require American telecommunications manufacturers and carriers to design their equipment and networks to optimise the authorities‚Äô wiretapping ability. Some industry insiders say they believe that some US machines approved for export contain NSA ‚Äúback doors‚Äù (also called ‚Äútrap doors‚Äù).

&gt;The United States has been trying to persuade European Union countries as well to allow it ‚Äúback-door‚Äù access to encryption programs, claiming that this was to serve the needs of law-enforcement agencies. However, a report released by the European Parliament in May 1999 asserted that Washington‚Äôs plans for controlling encryption software in Europe had nothing to do with law enforcement and everything to do with US industrial espionage. The NSA has also dispatched FBI agents on break-in missions to snatch code books from foreign facilities in the United States, and CIA officers to recruit foreign communications clerks abroad and buy their code secrets, according to veteran intelligence officials.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bqr495/useu_trade_in_goods_139_billion_surplus_in_2018/eo874dz/,VoiceOfRaeson,1558359230

4330,"Well almost, but not exactly, here is a TL;DR:

1920 - Trianon - no further explanation needed, just that a lot of ethnic hungarians got behind hungarian borders (not just Romania, most of them to Czechoslovakia (now only Slovakia) and Serbia as well).

mid 2000's - during left-side government ethnic hungarians living in these territories demand for dual-citizenship, so they officially can be recognized as hungarians. 

Question goes into referendum, and government goes into full-blown anti-campaign (reason: these people will most likely vote on then opposing Fidesz - which started the procedure that led to this referendum and is massively popular among them).

Referendum results end with a ""no"".

2010 - people vote for Fidesz. Now with their massive majority in parliament they give these people their most wanted dual-citizenship, and some financial support - from hungarian public funds. 

Of course they are also granted by right to vote during the hungarian elections.

Now, they theoretically could vote for anyone, but they won't. In fact, like 90% of transylvanian voters voted for Fidesz last time.

Also this number aint't much, but is just enough for one or two seats in parliament, which always is a question if Fidesz get's a 2/3 majority (in this case if they think of a new law, they don't need anyone else in opposition to vote for it, they just do it themselves - and they always do this).

One last note - as I said - the most unfair thing in this (besides the fact that they vote in a country's election, for which they don't pay taxes) is that they are allowed to vote by mail, while a hungarian (born in Hungary) living abroad is not.

Heck, if J√°nos from Szeged (Hu), and Mih√°ly from Arad (Ro) (towns ca. 40 km-s apart) live in the same flat in M√ºnchen want to vote in the Hungarian elections, J√°nos has to travel to Berlin to vote, while Mih√°ly can just send a letter.

4382,"&gt; I think it was mostly a aestethic and comfort vote, wouldn't it be a little odd to have minarets around chalets ?

It really wasn't. Switzerland has a very strict building code to prevent the thing you talk about. We can't even put solar panels on the roofs of historical buildings. It actually was the reason only 4 of them were ever approved and mostly in industrial zones.

I'm living around one of those 4 minarets. And it's a rather [tiny 3-4m tower](https://www.unilu.ch/fileadmin/_processed_/1/f/csm_wangen-haupt_50244f122c.jpg). And two to three towns over we have [this Buddhist temple](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g13927611-d13836054-Reviews-Buddhist_Temple-Gretzenbach.html) and two towns north [this Hindu temple](https://www.unilu.ch/fileadmin/_processed_/3/6/csm_trimbach-haupt_04fc8b3a0e.jpg). The later doesn't seem finished but I think you can see from the tower in the back how it is supposed to look. Of those three buildings the minaret certainly is the least ""intrusive"".

And lastly, if the vote would have been about ""aesthetics"" then the law would have been worded differently. Maybe banning ""non traditional religious buildings"" or something. But it only mentions that minarets can't be build anymore. Every other religion can still build their ""foreign looking"" temples and whatever just fine.

&gt; Also how would the imam and his prayers at 5 am in speakers would've worked?

It simply wouldn't. Again mostly because of good old Swiss bureaucracy about noise.

&gt; Obviously some people also voted no for the sake of being anti-islam but I doubt that was the majority

Of the no voters? I've yet to see one good reason for the ban which isn't covered by already existing laws.

4397,"He spent a long time to simplistically explain how the EU works, one second to answer the first question, a dubious answer for the second so why did they ask it, and then half the video to promote expanding one institution's power. He should have just simply explained the EU and how it works.

Other people on youtube have explained better how votes affect the mentality of parties besides the one you vote for, how much your vote matters when you're one in a million, whether tactical voting, or vote swapping, is any use in your system, and how different democratic systems fair differently. *Does my MEP vote matter?* can be talked about with *How do they count the votes? What does it mean to not be able to vote for parties from other countries that participate in the same parliament? What can I do if no party represents me? How many people vote alongside me; does my one in millions vote actually matter if I'm not in a voting bloc? How badly does voter apathy affect how much my vote is worth? How does someone stand to be an MEP?* It's not an easy topic and simplistically saying your vote matters because it's not thrown away is a two second answer, not 1 of 2 questions in an 8 minute video.

**In length, he should have redone almost the entire video,** and I am sorry for the text wall:

The title of the video asks if the EU's democratic, and then if your vote matters. 2 minutes of a rough history lesson which is fine. ~1.5 minutes of rough structure. 3:25-4:00, *35 seconds* for the structure is democratic and repeated for those at the back to hear. So we took 4 minutes to answer question 1 in what they actually displayed in a single screen at 3:35 in as much depth as they said in words.

Claims you only vote directly for the parliament, when as already explained you vote directly for 2 other institutions, unless certain EU states don't vote for their head of state (head of government takes over the role for the UK) and don't vote for their ministers. It's also incorrect, in the UK I can directly vote for the leader of most political parties, provided I get involved, who will be the head of government if they win, I also directly vote for my MP, though I indirectly vote for ministers who I take from this video are who get to go to the EU. I assume some of this is similar in other EU member states. I cannot directly vote for my MEPs, only their parties, unlike the visual vote of birb voting for specific birb, more on this later. The video is *directly* implying the parliament is *better* because of fudged logic.

4:29-4:46, 17 seconds to then say the parliament is strong... and then to state ""and thus your vote very influential"". Great, second question answered even if it's the very awkward logic of this gives to that strong thing, that strong implies this strong... oh we still have 3 minutes left, maybe it'll explain there.

4:57 we officially start the tangent began at saying the parliament is better, that the EU parliament lacks a power, look at the sad little birbs and then look at the angry birbs and the narrator saying this is why it's not democratic enough. 5:04 look at how the member state gov birbs, with their big loud beaks, are bullying the poor little, smol beak, defenceless MEP birbs, oh hey here's a solution:

&gt;giving the parliament more power would make the EU as a whole more democratic but it would also take power from member states [here's a democracy bar expanding to prove it, fuller = better], it's not clear which approach is better [but I won't say why, I'll just show a democracy bar getting smaller if the member states claw back control with their lasers]

And now we're full on advocate mode for give them more power and the last few words are pretty useless - it's not clear? How? Why? You just said *democracy* is why we should? Even the member state gov birbs get angry when power is taken from them rather than cowering in fear like the MEP birbs, so obviously we should go full democracy to make my vote stronger, because you parliament strong = my vote strong. Heck let's dissect this visual metaphor of MEPs on left, demo. bar starts on left, gets bigger as MEPs are more powerful &amp; nat. govs are less, nat. govs never go off screen (still have power), demo. bar never full, clearly if we had *no nat. govs* then the demo. bar would be full! To be a little more level headed, the video already said we vote for our nat. gov, so it's flawed logic to state the EU would be more democratic if, simply put, one group of democratically elected representatives gets the power another group of democratically elected representatives already have. None of this answers if the EU is democratic nor if my vote matters, it's just promoting shifting which votes matter in what specific capacity.

5:28, conclusion: EU not as democratic as its member states... we never talked about member states. Here are some arbitrary visual metaphor scores. The conclusion implies it is democratic but on a scale it's only *some* democratic *relative* to something not discussed and the second question is forgotten.

5:35,

&gt;if you don't like decisions they make... you can look up what your representatives voted for and vote them out

hey that's great, I didn't know the EU let me see those, I know Westminster does in the UK. Unfortunately won't affect Farage's voter base, they don't care how he votes.

5:43-6:13, your vote changes how the EU will be in the future, parliament stronger = stronger vote, look at all the happy chirruping birbies, but look at the angry birb who thins his gaze and wants it to go bye bye, look at how it makes the little MEP birbs unhappy.

&gt;It's for you to decide what you think is better for the future of the union

Hm, happy thing or angry &amp; sad thing, what's better for the future of the union. Well I suppose Kurz is saying it'll be more democratic, happier and stronger, and therefore my vote will be stronger, so I should blindly follow this political advertisement.

6:25... to the end? Opinion segment. ""Scapegoating is happening but I'm not naming names"" is apparently opinion despite there being bountiful evidence for this in more than one member state. Unfortunately this is a useless point, it doesn't go anywhere and shouldn't exist as its own special piece, it was fine in passing mention at the start as the concern people have that the EU is going over their heads to do things. Empty platitude about go vote because others will and you'll not get what you wanted, since my national vote doesn't count due to FPTP + safe seat, so I have no influence over the EU there, and my country's main two parties want something I don't, my referendum vote doesn't count due to 1.9% of the voters, and the politicians I didn't vote for, being the will of the people, and more influential in my country's influence of the EU than my MEP vote ever could be, and my MEP vote will likely not matter for multiple reasons, starting with the Brexit Party is leagues ahead in the polls, middling with I'm one of millions of voters before even looking at the rest of the member states' citizens voting, and ending with no-one cares none of the parties say (or don't say) what they're going to do as MEPs, but that it means they'll have a bigger mandate in national gov, but it won't really because MEPs are not nat. gov. Visual metaphor from earlier of nests for our chicks is not very welcome, because the EU does not build houses for our children, our nat. govs do that.",,/r/europe/comments/bqgfn1/is_the_eu_democratic_does_your_vote_matter/eo88r2n/,CosmicScientist,1558360444

4513,"&gt; Thats not the same. Germany attacked the Western Allies and then the Soviet Union. This brought them to the same side of the war. [...] Instead they decided to aid Nazi Germany and invade the Soviet Union with them.

So the Allies, as you put it, aided Stalin and his murderous USSR? With the same standards you're applying on Finland somehow being responsible for Germany's actions on the Eastern Front, the western Allies are also responsible for the USSR's actions in Finland and the Eastern front:

- Invasion of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland

- Genocide in Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Finland

- Deportations, concentration camps, rape warfare, etc.

Nevermind the fact that if the USSR hadn't invaded Finland, *there wouldn't have been a Northern front at all.*

&gt; Finland on the other hand was not in a state of war as of 1941. They could have been perfectly stayed neutral in 1941.

I see. So the problem we have here is actually a lack of knowledge. Well, that's easy to fix. Finland's reasons:

Karelia was occupied in 1940 in a [war of aggression.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermath_of_the_Winter_War#Soviet_views)

Finland was starving due to failed harvests from 1938 onwards. The country was then invaded by the USSR, which worsened the situation. After the Winter War in 1940 the country was starving. Germany was the only country willing to sell grain. This sale came with a demand for quid pro quo beyond payment: allowing German troops through Finland. Less then a generation earlier, 10% of Finland's population had died from famine so this crisis was fresh in memory. Annual grain deliveries of 180,000 t (200,000 short tons) equaled almost half of the Finnish domestic crop.

Since the USSR had [failed to annex Finland](https://old.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/boftu8/afgan_fighter_using_socalled_australian_grip/enl07gx/), they continued to demand passage of Soviet troops through the country and military bases along the coast. The USSR shot down a Finnish civilian airliner. The USSR demanding which politicians were allowed to be in office. The peace was already in 1940 called the ""Interrim peace"" because of this [aggression from the USSR.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim_Peace#Continued_Soviet_pressure) Without additional arms, Finland would have lasted only weeks against a new Soviet attack.

&gt; Thats not ""Information warfare."", just normal historic facts.

If Greece was not in the EZ, or was kicked out, then the speculators would simply have moved on to the next target and so on.

4599,"Not completely, there are some differences.

1. France has a 'final warning' step in its nuclear policy. A limited nuclear-strike against military assets, as a mean to warn the opponent. Final warning can not be repeated, and if the opponent doesn't back down, it would be followed up by massive strikes that would have an ""unacceptable/unbearable cost for the enemy"" (that part is similar to the UK/US)
2. France is clear about the response it would use, but unclear on what would be the threshold for it to use it (a vague ""threat to its vital interest""). UK/US are clear about the threshold (""WMD regional threat"" but unclear about how they would respond (conventional or nuclear). IIRC, the UK policy seems to be evolving more towards the ""vital interest"" approach as well, but take that with a grain of salt.
3. Although French had more than once said that its nuclear deterrence would also cover European interests, they never fully/officially committed to the concept of extended nuclear shield/deterrence.

So France won't use it on a whim, (they always say they will automatically use it as soon as its vital interests are concerned - conditions are defined), and there is still a step before the full ""launch everything and we'll see how it goes""",,/r/europe/comments/bql8lb/europe_is_not_ready_to_defend_itself_at_all_new/eo7qyo9/,Aeliandil,1558345823

4632,"Finland did not allow supplies into the city from the North. Finland watched while millions starved to the death.

Furthermore, in *The German Northern Theater of Operations 1940-1945*, Earl F. Ziemke writes:

&gt;The true expectations with which the Finns entered the war are difficult to determine. As a small nation caught in the center of a great struggle they could not afford the luxury of consistency any more than could the Great Powers. Their announced war aims were limited to recovery of the lost territories; that they expected to take a good deal more is certain. Bellicose utterances by Mannerheim and others, particularly during the early months of the war, are not hard to find. \*The most extreme statement of Finnish war aims was that which \[Finnish President\] Ryti gave to Hitler's personal envoy Schnurre in October 1941: Finland wanted the entire Kola Peninsula and all of Soviet Karelia with a border on the White Sea to the Gulf of Onega, thence southward to the southern tip of Lake Onega, along the Svir River, the south shore Lake Ladoga, and along the Neva River to its mouth. Ryti agreed with the Germans that Leningrad would have to disappear as a center of population and industry.\* He thought a small part of the city might be preserved as something in the nature of a German trading post. \*Later he also told the German Minister that Finland did not want to have a common border with Russia in the future and asked that Germany annex all the territory from the Arkhangel'sk region south.\* (p. 204)

Similarly, Henrik O. Lunde writes in *Finland's War of Choice: The Troubled German-Finnish Coalition in World War II*:

&gt;The stated Finnish war aims were limited to the recovery of territory lost during the Winter War; hence they refer to the conflict from 1941 to 1944 as the ""Continuation War."" However, it is patently obvious from statements and events both before and during the war that they hoped to come out of the war with much more than the territory lost in 1940.  
The most ambitious statements of Finnish aspirations appear to be those given by President Ryti to Ambassador Schnurre in October 1941. \*He let it be known that Finland desired all of the Kola Peninsula and all of Soviet Karelia with a border on the White Sea to the Gulf of Onega (√Ñ√§ninen). Also included in his wishes were Ladoga Karelia and that the future border should then proceed along the Svir River, the southern shore of Lake Ladoga, and finally along the Neva River to where it entered the Gulf of Finland. \*Within a couple of weeks of this statement, Ryti told Ambassador Bl√ºcher that Finland did not want a common border with the Soviet Union after the war and he requested that Germany annex all territory south of the Archangel region. The views that Ryti expressed in October 1941 may be what prompted Hitler to tell \[Finnish\] Foreign Minister Witting the following month when he came to Berlin to sign the Anti-Comintern Pact that Germany favored an expansion of Finland to the east, to include the Kola Peninsula as long as Germany shared in the mineral resources. Witting told Bl√ºcher after his visit to Berlin that it was necessary for Finland's security to hold on to the captured territories. (p. 56)

4700,"&gt; Your refugees have banded together and are causing crime to skyrocket. On a religious basis, you suffer terrorism and the destruction of your own religions/symbology.

Actually, crime in Germany has [fallen to its lowest point since 1992](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-crime-rate-lowest-since-1992/).

You mentioned earlier how important it is to check sources. Did you verify your own assertion based on a UK Tabloid known for spewing lies (and for this reason blocked here)? [875 acts of vandalism](https://www.liberation.fr/checknews/2019/04/18/est-il-vrai-que-875-eglises-ont-ete-vandalisees-en-france-en-un-an_1721930) does not equate 875 ""attacks"", and it's very interesting to note that these acts of vandalism also include swastika graffitis. This little fact of course seems to get burried in the Islamophobic narrative. Just google ""France 875 churches"", and the amount of results speaks as much an obvious language as how they twist the truth.

Perhaps you should just be more careful as to exactly *where* you ""hear"" things. This is not to say that immigrants may not be responsible for a higher quota of crimes than native citizens, but being an egalitarian, I would loathe to judge people on a summary basis rather than looking at each individual and assessing their own character.

&gt; This is exactly what I mean by a double standard- these officials and bigwigs like to sell you on the idea of neutrality and goodwill, but you have a clear case where the peers of this council have reached a unanimous decision regarding a large scale tragedy that this council conveniently overlooks.

Again: the court *has no authority to decide this*. It would be overstepping its mandate. Blame the Allies for deciding not to press charges and instead courting the new government as a potential ally. As of now, it really just sounds as if you're desperately looking to cast blame.

&gt; The Armenians killed in this genocide were all Christians who were taught to turn the other cheek in the event of adversity. Is it possible they simply agree with the court's ruling that free speech is something to be upheld and simple denial of a tragedy is not worth criminal prosecution?

That makes no sense, considering it was Armenians who decided to press charges in Switzerland in the first place.

*""The judgement is a very good result for Armenia and for Armenians. It means that states in Europe can punish Armenian genocide denial if it is calculated to incite violence or racial disharmony.""*

-- Gevorg Kostanyan, Armenian Prosecutor General

&gt; From a legal standpoint, and at the very least having only considered this, there is nothing saying that something needs to be 'sufficiently inflammatory' to imprison someone for genocide denial. No, this explicitly states that any denial of any genocide is an imprisonable offense. European Parliament ruled in favor of the genocide. I think anyone looking at this objectively has already seen the genocide for what it is- even you will admit it.

If it wasn't against Swiss law the guy wouldn't have been convicted there in the first place. The case went before the ECHR because he sued on the basis that Swiss law is a breach of the European Charter of Human Rights with regards to Freedom of Expression. The Charter does not include any provisions for genocide denial, so Freedom of Expression overrides Swiss law. I hope you'd agree that the holocaust is a bit different as antisemitism is still very much a problem to this very day. For this reason, although holocaust denial is *not* punishable in all European states, those that *do* punish it will not be opposed by the ECHR, because then you've got a case of racial hatred.

I hope this explains the legal situation a bit better?

&gt; The people, in the event of having discovered an instance where their government is not wholly acting in their interests and may instead be complicit in divisory tactics, needs to be FORCIBLY returned to a state which encourages patriotism and independent thought.

Well, maybe you should consider that rather than people being submissive and complacent, they are by and large actually just *satisfied* and would even *oppose* an armed uprising, because they have pride in European democracy. Sure, there are some things we really need to work on, but to go from there to a need for revolution is quite the stretch. Might as well ask why there's no uprising in the US yet, the situation there certainly seems more polarized and volatile than over here.

&gt; I know that people like to naysay slippery slope arguments, but it's been proven that not every slippery slope is a fallacy- look at the people who claimed abortions would lead to 'abortions' on babies that were already outside the womb. It happened here in the US!

Did you link the wrong story? Either way, I'm fairly certain that an ""abortion"" of already-born children would constitute murder in both the US as well as any EU Member State, with no court of law arguing otherwise.

&gt; Similarly, we only need to look at the Brits to see how the whole 'dangerous self-defense weapon bans' are working. Good grief, they can't even carry a fucking spoon now? Again. Yuri. People incapable of defending themselves.

[Seems to be working](https://twitter.com/tha_rami/status/971074126470369281?lang=en). ;)

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/82huv7/dutch_high_school_students_chase_away_a_man_with/) is a video of the incident, by the way. I think we both know how this might have turned out at an US school.

&gt; Responsible firearm owners have stopped not only other shooters, but also terrorists and other violent extremists with explosives or vehicles. The concerted attack to make firearms look like a negative is none other than one of Yuri's described tactics of demoralization and subversion.

And many ""responsible firearm owners"" turned unresponsible at some point, or weren't as responsible as whoever sold them the gun had thought. Are you invoking a global conspiracy against any political opinion opposing yours? Have you considered that some people in the US might just be sick of so much gun violence? Or how this must look from places like Europe or Japan, where such laws have prevented similar outbursts of violence for decades? And it's not just the illegal firearms either. How many innocent Americans have died to US cops being too trigger-happy at the job because everyone might be carrying?

I dunno about you, but I think it's nice that in the country I currently reside in, street cops don't carry any firearm. Nope, not even a pistol. It's not considered necessary. For the few crimes involving guns, they just call in a special unit carrying SMGs, but it *is* a point of pride that for day-to-day policing, pepper spray is enough.

&gt; You cannot tell me that speech always leads to the harm of someone else, as humans frequently say stupid things they don't even hold claim to.

Have you tried making this argument to the parents of a kid that was bullied into suicide? Have you tried telling people who are subject to daily death threats that they should just grow a thicker skin? Maybe you want to talk to that Armenian you mentioned earlier, tell them it's not such a big deal.

I think it's easy to dismiss the plight of someone else.

&gt; ... do you look at that video and deny that our media is controlled by negative interests?

4791,"&gt; One last question, why is there little to no reference to the other  historical regions of Romania, Moldavia and vallachia In the Hungarian  media?

Most Hungarians don't care much for events particular to *only* those regions of Romania. Distinguishing between the two kingdoms is beyond the average compatriots level of understanding of Romanian history and culture (and, may I add, *regional* news of Romania that don't affect Hungarians are not really interesting for a Hungarian audience). Reporting on only one of the two kingdoms would have to contain some explanation for wider audiences, but such reporting would be of little or no interest anyway. 

Other regional news reporting usually get a city name or a geographical region (eg. 'the Danube Delta' or 'Bucharest'), naturally.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Hungarians are interested in Hungarian communities, of which one rather significant is the Hungarian community in Transylvania (which distinguishes that community from *other* Hungarian communities). We are somewhat interested in neighbouring countries, too, one of which is Romania.

I sincerely see nothing wrong with that.

&gt; They are just Romania. What happened to specificity? 

'Romania' specifically refers to the state of Romania and includes Transylvania.

The two kingdoms collectively - without Transylvania - are sometimes referred to as *Reg√°t*. It is used to counterpoint Transylvanian (in an emphatically non-national sense) opinion with, well, *Reg√°t* opinion (eg. in the context of your last presidential elections).

&gt;Also there is the csango minority in Moldavia, but little to non  reference of the Moldavian region... maybe just the csango region. 

*Cs√°ng√≥*s are almost always referred to as '*moldvai cs√°ng√≥(-k)*', ie. the Cs√°ng√≥s from Moldavia during the introduction of a report, to establish the facts.",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/bq30dd/postcard_from_haferland_transylvania/eo75fhp/,StatementsAreMoot,1558332163

What about ""such action completely contradict with the European values the EU is supposedely founded on"" do you not understand? 

&gt; the EU will do what is best for the EU and its citizens first and foremost.

No it's not, otherwise it wouldn't threaten to cancel aggreements that are for the benefit of EU citizens as well as Swiss cititens. E.g. cancelling the Schengen agreement with Switzerland would mean that 2-3 million EU citizens who either live in Switzerland or in one of the many borders regions that are fully dependent from Switzerland (most people work in Switzerland but live in France/Germany/Italy) would be fucked. But considering the power trip the EU is currently on I think the EU would even accept such a loss, just because they know that the loss for Switzerland would be even greater. So much about European cooperation and solidarity.... in the end is just another project driven by a hunger for power.

Swiss voters didn't never cut any research and funding agreements, in fact Switzerland is usually one of the first nations to ratify the new agreements, it was the EU that tried to blackmail Switzerland by making cuts to two completely unrelated agreements (Horizon, Erasmus) as a result of a referndum outcome about immigration in 2013 that didn't end as the EU wished it would.

It's fine for you to have an editorial opinion - that's not the part of the video I care about. The problem here is that you should at least put *something* into the 'fact-based' portion of the video to show what the 'other side' are concerned about.

4877,"I'd caution against putting labels onto people so easily. ""Left"" and ""Right"" aren't just two monolithic hiveminds each propagating a uniform opinion and shutting out any deviants; there are a lot of opinions on either side, and only your stance on some critical fundamental questions will determine whether you're more right- or more left-leaning.

You can still support LGBT rights without advocating transgender men competing on womens' terms. Being against this doesn't make you ""right-wing"" as long as, for example, you'd still support transgender people being allowed to serve in the military. There are good arguments as to why the former could constitute an unfair advantage, and maybe the debate should focus on alternatives that could serve as a compromise (for example a points conversion system, or just a third division for transgender athletes), whereas the latter is just about treating them as ordinary members of society.

As for socialism/communism, I think you are making a mistake when attributing failure to these economic models when there are just as many capitalist countries that have failed. What actually links these examples is that they were all dictatorships. Perhaps a socialist/communist democracy would fare better? We might have seen one in Allende's Chile, had the right-wing military, with tacit CIA support, not staged a coup and thrown the country into bloody tyranny.

I've actually grown up in a socialist country -- East Germany, to be precise. And my memories of that time aren't too bad. But perhaps a more important point is that socialist policies have been a cornerstone of European governance for decades. Even now, we have the concept of the ""social market economy"", which means a capitalist free market regulated by socialist policies, to achieve a balance of power and fight inequality.

You may not be aware of it, but the US benefits or benefited from a number of socialist policies as well. Medicare would be one example. Obamacare, too, as much as the Republicans want to get rid of it. Net Neutrality, which the Republicans got rid off successfully. Even taxes are a socialist concept, considering they are about the state requisitioning money from citizens and using it to improve the community by building roads or funding schools. A country that runs on 100% capitalism would have everything privatized, that'd be a cyberpunk dystopian hellhole. This is why in reality, each country has a mix of capitalist and socialist policies, they just draw the line at different places.

In short, I suppose what I want to say is: don't get hung up on opposing things just because they are associated with a political agenda. For the US in particular it seems like socialism/communism are dirty words that immediately cause people to switch into Cold Warrior mode, as if a President Sanders would switch the Stars 'n Stripes with a Hammer and Sickle flag on day 1 of taking office.

&gt; All in light of our very own Russia collusion investigation, which conclusively proved that our administration had no such dealings. The extremist left-controlled media will continue telling you otherwise ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

[I see a fairly balanced reporting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/republicans-and-democrats-brace-for-renewed-battles-over-mueller-report/2019/03/23/56d9f214-4db3-11e9-b79a-961983b7e0cd_story.html), keeping in mind that there remain some open questions. Did you perchance pick up this perception on extremist right-controlled media? ;)

&gt; What are you referencing? Austria? Traitors get what's coming to them, no matter what side they're on. I'm extremely disappointed to hear the details of the event, and seeing so many officials step down over the issue breaks my heart as I thought they'd make a solid ally alongside Poland, Italy, and Hungary (currently the most amenable nations to the US, I should say). That being said, I don't notice any outward censorship or the same type of militant legislation that you see in the countries we've been discussing. Perhaps you can clarify a bit more.

Austria, yes. [Germany's AfD](https://www.dw.com/en/german-afd-parliamentarian-could-be-under-russian-influence-report/a-48221119) as well. Or [France's Front National](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/08/russia-europe-right-putin-front-national-eu). Shady links to Russian money and connections are seeded like a red thread (if you pardon the pun) linking right-wing parties throughout Europe.

You already mentioned earlier how Moscow used divisive tactics in an effort to undermine western democracies. Putin is an ex-KGB man himself. Do you think they ever stopped? Have you considered that maybe it's not the European (or the American) leftists who are the targets of subversion of today's Russia?

As for censorship, in the EU, Orban's Hungary is facing heavy criticism for how it's taken control of the media -- and Austria's Strache outright referred to this as something he wants to achieve as well.

&gt; Capitalism puts economic power in the hands of the people whereas Communism and Socialism both rely on the government to redistribute everyone's resources (or more commonly, keep them for themselves).

But that's not true, is it? Capitalism gives a shit about ""the people"" as a whole. Capitalism empowers the *individual* at the cost of the collective. You can't have your cake and eat it, too. Look at [this chart](https://www.businessinsider.in/These-10-companies-control-almost-everything-you-eat-and-drink/articleshow/54569038.cms), for example. Does it look like it's ""the people"" who are in control of economic power? Pure capitalism is a downwards spiral where the early bird gets the worm, and subsequently has an advantage against the competition. Let an economy run for a few decades, and you end up with multinational megacorporations whose only motivation is to exploit employee and consumer as best as they can.

You have to consider that private companies and governments aren't actually that different in nature. Each is a form of leadership designed to manage a body of resources (manpower, infrastructure, etc), they differ only in their mandate. Sometimes you can even witness an overlap in practice, e.g. Chinese state-capitalism, or the East India Company's stewardship of India.

Once you get this similarity, you'll see that and why governments and private companies are inherently opposed forces, as in a way they are both competing for the same resource -- one's citizens are the other's employees and consumers. So there's a power struggle, and the company's greed for profit has to be regulated by the government, as history has proven time and again (Radium Girls, US railway cartels, company stores, etc).

Who do you trust more? A democratically elected government is responsible towards its people. A private corporation only to its shareholders. At the very least you should be interested in a good balance, unless you agree that scrapping Net Neutrality is surely going to benefit US netizens like yourself. As a European, I prefer our regulations for more competition, health and safety, privacy.

&gt; For example, would you currently accept all of the laws of the US even though it does not have laws enforcing dignity? Would you want to live under a government with laws like Iran or even Russia? Ideally, we'd have a grand council which agreed to such things, but I'm pretty sure that the people pushing for socialism/communism shifted globalism don't care for democracies.

I think you're held back by your own Cold War-era prejudice here, considering I think of myself as a leftist democrat. :P

Indeed, the European Union itself should be a shining example of different countries coming together, and we're more and more bringing different legislation into line thanks to Union Directives aiming to harmonize legal approaches. There's no reason to believe that such a Council is impossible on a larger scale; I am actually a supporter of the United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, too.

https://en.unpacampaign.org/10619/european-lawmakers-call-for-a-un-parliamentary-assembly-and-a-2020-un-reform-summit/

As for acceptance of laws, I think different laws can be sorted into  ""conservative"" and ""progressive"", so a hypothetical unification could come with a tier-system where Member States are free to stick with conservative legislation but encouraged to move towards progressive legislation based on the UN's Human Rights Charter. This should make it easier for prospective Member States to sign up for participation, whilst encouraging a gradual transition towards a uniform ""Constitution of Man"" driven by interaction and trade as well as incentives similar to the EU's [ENP Action Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Neighbourhood_Policy).

As far as continent-spanning empires go, I think we will see the world divided between a US, European and Chinese hegemony in the mid-future. The signs are hard to miss; both the EU as well as China are slowly asserting themselves as global players, increasingly wielding both military as well as economic instruments. The US may have retreated somewhat, but Middle- and South America are still in their immediate neighborhood, so I'm sure they will retain an interest, and it's too far away for any other major power. I only wonder where Russia will find itself in this future, for as much as it currently tries to sabotage the EU in an attempt to maintain the status quo, neither its military nor its economy look fit to restore its glory from the days of the USSR.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bq3qk9/anticorrupution_protest_in_vienna_austria/eo6u3eu/,akashisenpai,1558326213

4918,"&gt;Take a look at the PCA plots of these Anatolian ""Greeks"" and these Greek islanders. Notice how they don't cluster near one another.

Changing the goalposts now are we? Sure, we'll do that. 

Greeks from both coastal Western Anatolia and the coastal mainland/islands have overlapping Y-DNA haplogroups due to migrations going back to a likely common patrilineal line in antiquity. Similarities can be seen between overlapping R1B+J2, J2+E and J2+E haplogroups. Otoh, Anatolian Greeks from Pontus or Cappadocia were mostly assimilated Anatolians.

Greek mainlanders from elsewhere are slightly different due to a Slavic influx 1000 or so years back similar to the Turkic influx in Anatolia around the same time.

4972,"On 14 February 2019, the National Council's Legal Affairs Committee approved the bill to allow same-sex marriage by 19 to 4, with one abstention. Another bill that would allow access to sperm donations for lesbian couples was narrowly rejected. The two proposals will be sent out for public consultation, after which the Federal Council will revisit the legislation and could then present it to the Swiss Parliament for approval. It is possible that the option to make sperm donation legal for married women will be removed during that consultation process if it is judged to be too controversial. Both proposals will end registered partnerships.The committee started the consultation on 14 March, which will last until 21 June 2019.

4990,"&gt; Consider that refugees and globalization ... Arguing in favor of rights for some but not for others kind of undermines the concept.

Of course, if people are under attack by a tyrannical government and can prove through their consistent goodwill with native populations and their government that they will be law-abiding citizens, we have a moral obligation to take them in and afford them space until the time when they can return.

What isn't said, however, is that no form of government HAS to take them in. Yes, it's humane to take them. But look at the state of Western Europe. Your refugees have banded together and are causing crime to skyrocket. On a religious basis, you suffer terrorism and the destruction of your own religions/symbology. As proof of that, we need look no further than France. I won't jump to the conclusion that the Notre Dame was an unquestionable attack, but the fact is that France suffered a grand total of 875 churches attacked (link censored) (2.4 attacks per day on average) in a single year!

I've heard of streets in France where women are heckled for simply being outside, not just for their lack of a headcover. It's my understanding that when you visit someone else's house, you abide by their rules and respect their property. If someone or some group is responsible for this kind of widespread destruction, and you cannot definitively say which parts of the group are responsible, no matter how badly you feel for the innocent ones, you have no choice but to kick them all out to prevent further destruction. Again, to Yuri's video, this is precisely in line with his commentary of a populace being unable to think of ways to defend themselves, because they are too focused on being humane! It is a blessing and a curse, but the world and politics, as you say, are not black and white, so we must elect to salvage what we can WHILE we can.

&gt;  It's disappointing in this case, but the law is meant to be neutral, and you can't have courts cherrypick.

&gt; Technicalities are the basis of law, that's just a fact.

This is exactly what I mean by a double standard- these officials and bigwigs like to sell you on the idea of neutrality and goodwill, but you have a clear case where the peers of this council have reached a unanimous decision regarding a large scale tragedy that this council conveniently overlooks. This case has already been acknowledged as a genocide by several entities that are NOT simply some homegrown councils or school committees- European Parliament made their decision an entire decade prior! But this group lets a genocide denier off because they 'want to be careful'? It doesn't add up!

And speculation on my part- The Armenians killed in this genocide were all Christians who were taught to turn the other cheek in the event of adversity. Is it possible they simply agree with the court's ruling that free speech is something to be upheld and simple denial of a tragedy is not worth criminal prosecution?

Can we then say that it is fair to prosecute people only when they agree they've been offended by another party? It is nigh impossible to keep up with that from a legal standpoint, I'd say.

&gt; Why are you ignoring two of the three points I mentioned?

I really had to pick and choose what to respond to as I was 2 characters away from the comment limit and would've probably spent the better part of my night composing two or even three messages rather than one had I chosen to address every single point you brought up, so I apologize if it seems like I have skipped or am skipping over anything you've brought to the conversation.

One of your points was that the court did not deem the denial to be 'sufficiently inflammatory' (I believe, I sincerely hope I'm hitting the right part here =p). I glossed over this as, again, it's a double standard when you consider Swiss law expresses this : 

&gt; any person who on any of these grounds denies, trivializes or seeks justification for genocide or other crimes against humanity ... is liable to a custodial sentence not exceeding three years or to a monetary penalty. 

From a legal standpoint, and at the very least having only considered this, there is nothing saying that something needs to be 'sufficiently inflammatory' to imprison someone for genocide denial. No, this explicitly states that any denial of any genocide is an imprisonable offense. European Parliament ruled in favor of the genocide. I think anyone looking at this objectively has already seen the genocide for what it is- even you will admit it.

Your other point is then the court's ruling about Switzerland's laws which Switzerland is free to ordain as they choose? I mean, the court ruling looks good for show, but like I just lined out, it doesn't really make sense when you consider this is Swiss law where their rulings are final, not some independent council's.

&gt; It is you who is arguing for the rules to be enforced un-equally.

Not sure what you mean here. I'm simply asking for rules restricting expression to be done away with and attempting to highlight areas where they are not being enforced equally as a display of how they can be twisted toward totalitarian censorship. Honestly, in hindsight, I should've picked a much better news article to discuss.

&gt; does that mean we should ignore the law?

I mean, we should adhere to the law, but at the same time, the law has a complete and utter obligation to be impartial. If it is failing for any reason whatsoever, it needs revision. If the failings are due to an agenda and are enforced half-heartedly, they should be repealed completely. You and I both agree that fairness should be the goal for any legal system, I understand.

&gt; Submissiveness and complacency? I don't see that, given various high-profile demonstrations over the past couple months/years.

Again, I both love and hate saying it, but Yuri's videos! The people, in the event of having discovered an instance where their government is not wholly acting in their interests and may instead be complicit in divisory tactics, needs to be FORCIBLY returned to a state which encourages patriotism and independent thought. Peaceful protests and candlelight vigils are nice and seem representative of an enlightened civilization, but you need only look at the gilets jaunes to see the reality of the situation. 27 weeks, and I will freely call them both complacent and submissive.

And trust me, I actually hate admitting that one.

&gt; The way I see it, there is an obsession with unlimited free speech ... Another constitutional issue is the easy availability of firearms, which ceased being a guarantor against state oppression the day tanks were invented

Hm.. I'll agree that everyone's making a pretty big deal about free speech, but the whole hate and divisiveness thing is not something that has always been present on this scale. I know that people like to naysay slippery slope arguments, but it's been proven that not every slippery slope is a fallacy- look at the people who claimed abortions would lead to 'abortions' on babies that were already outside the womb. [It happened here in the US!](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-york-passes-abortion-bill-late-term-if-mothers-health-is-at-risk-today-2019-01-23/)

I make that same argument: 'sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me'. Do not let a single infringement upon your right to speak your mind to occur, or you will lose that right completely.

Similarly, we only need to look at the Brits to see how the whole 'dangerous self-defense weapon bans' are working. Good grief, they can't even carry a fucking spoon now? Again. Yuri. People incapable of defending themselves.

As to the guns being invalidated by tanks argument- you are somewhat right. It's a bloody nightmare imagining having to fight an Abrams tank with nothing other than alcohol and homemade explosives. But we have those things. Not only that, but soldiers are people, too. Some (or even many) of those tanks could be on our side. Should we surrender firearms just because of the existence of tanks? Hell no! We have way more people than tanks, and tanks are NOT the only threat to fight in a civil war.

Another note, a lot of criminal activity regarding firearms is a direct result of illegal gun ownership or gang activity. Responsible firearm owners have stopped not only other shooters, but also terrorists and other violent extremists with explosives or vehicles. The [concerted attack to make firearms look like a negative](https://fox6now.com/2018/08/09/children-found-in-new-mexico-compound-were-training-for-school-shootings-prosecutors-say/) is none other than one of Yuri's described tactics of demoralization and subversion. The people in that article are the same Sunni Islam radicals that everyone thinks we should blindly accept.

&gt; There's plenty of extreme right-wing opinions ... You are basically adopting an ""everything or nothing"" stance on this, as if a speed limit on roads would mean nobody is allowed to drive a car.

Here we can differentiate the laws rather easily. One restricts something harmless on its own, which is speech. The other restricts action which, especially this action, in the event of speeding, can almost always lead to devastating harm of something or someone.

You cannot tell me that speech always leads to the harm of someone else, as humans frequently say stupid things they don't even hold claim to.

&gt; Huh, a bit surprised to hear that. It was a bit of a meme.

Oh, I've seen that video before, but I never saw the Sinclair name attached to it. I was actually thinking about finding it until I saw you linked the same exact thing, heh

... do you look at that video and deny that our media is controlled by negative interests? =P It's the same way in the US and in Europe, from my experience.

5166,"&gt; The homicide rates in Australia began to drop long before the ban (around 1990) which wasn't a ban per se

1st: It's you introducing the stricter regulation as a ban and then saying it wasn't really a ban. I never called it a ban. I just find that kind of wording very weird.

2nd: 

Australia Homicide rate 1989-1995‚â•1.8

Australia homicide rate after 2002‚â§1.5

So demonstrably nope, the drop in homicide rates generally coincides with stricter regulation of guns made in 1996 and 2002.

&gt; Interestingly, non-gun related suicides went up after the ban and Australia currently has more suicides than pre 1996

Which is a trend in virtually all of the 1st world. Gun ownership is at best a secondary factor to suicide which should be evident by countries like Japan and South Korea which have virtually no guns but all the suicides. South Korea literally has the 7th lowest gun ownership rate in the world and the 4th highest suicide rate.

oh yeah, ask Argentina about that. /s

A default would have meant that any investment fund would avoid your government bonds like the plague. If you think you had it bad now, multiply that by 10. Many, if not most, pension funds and other institutional investors are bound by statute not to invest in high risk titles below a threshold rating.

You may object that the ratings given by S&amp;P and the likes are not fair, and I would agree with you, given how Lehman Brothers and other junk titles were rated, but so far we haven't set up an alternative system and certainly little Greece won't have the power to create it alone.

Besides, yes, the country's finances have been depleted by the financial crisis, but the pockets of the Greeks were certainly not empty, given the endemic tax evasion happening in Greece.

In case you complain that I am seeing the splinter in your eyes and ignore the beam in mine, no, the fact that Italy has appalling tax evasion and ballooning debt does not excuse us either.

5214,"You might have misunderstood me. I DO think it is a good thing for richer countries to invest and fund development (education, health , infrastructure etc) in poorer countries. And I think that is true within a counrty (in CH richer cantons fund the federal state which redistributes to poorer cantons), within the EU, in the continental Europe in general, and in the world. But it obviously can't do it just by saying it and without rules and purpose and control. Money flows to poorer countries in Africa have resulted in extremely resilient corruption and has been counterproductive (unless it was meant to do so...). 

CH can't just dump money in eastern countries or to the EU without a purpose and an objective. We gave that aforementioned [billion](https://www.erweiterungsbeitrag.admin.ch/erweiterungsbeitrag/en/home/the-swiss-contribution/kurzportraet-erweiterungsbeitrag.html) to [eastern european countries](https://www.eda.admin.ch/erweiterungsbeitrag/en/home/countries.html) precisely to ""reduce the economic and social disparities in an enlarged EU"". To my knowledge we do not receive a cent from the EU for anything even when the richer EU countries receive some specific funds. And it is fine since we are not part of it, but I don't see how you could expect CH to give even more when it obviously is already giving money to EU countries.

I already answered about the infrastructure, we finance by our own vital infrastructures for the continent and the EU doesn't share that burden, don't see why we should finance others. 

We don't have any form historical responsibility in the communist rule or the WWII, we **rightfully** benefit from our common exchanges and we are indeed helping. **All that to just say** that I have the absolute right to talk shit about corrupt and retarded far-right governments in eastern countries.

5215,"""Positive liberty"" is not a liberty, it's a capacity. Virtually every philosopher up until Hegel referred to freedom in the negative sense.

&gt;Protecting the weaker members of society from the deranged and stupid people is giving them freedom.

Freedom comes with risks and costs to a society. This is why alcohol can kill 200k people in the EU a year, be it through murders, accidents, suicides, and disease. However if the EU mandated 400% taxes and monopoly-run stores, there would be riots.

You want to argue that freedom is not unlimited and there should be restrictions? Go ahead. Just stop guising it as a ""liberty"" because your notion of freedom has led to authoritarianism, or a massive padded nanny state at best routinely.

Lastly, I'm not American. The leftists here want to ban handguns and semi autos even though we already have licensing. If a nation like Switzerland which has one of the lowest murder rates in the world, gets blackmailed to adopt stricter laws or risk economic impacts, **nothing** will make the anti-guns happy.

 * There is an ice hockey championship tournament in Slovakia. The life in the country stands still because of it - everybody is watching, commenting, discussing, after all, we have 5 million ice hockey coaches in Slovakia.
 * Prime minister Peter Pellegrini (party Smer) heavily criticised his fellow party member Lubos Blaha, who is known for his very controversial Facebook statuses, often praising communist regime before '89, praising leaders on Cuba and in Venezuela, etc. Blaha wrote in his Facebook status that ""European union is a band of losers"". Blaha is currently the chairman of Committee for European affairs. The leader of the party, Robert Fico, backed Lubos Blaha and recommended to Pellegrini to not be so heavy in his criticism.
 * Minister of Culture, Lubica Lassakova, stopped all grants for LGBTI organisations. Official reasoning is that the expert committee didnt recommend to continue supporting projects of LGBTI organisations. However the members of the expert committee stated the exact opposite - they recommended to give full funding to 6 out of 8 projects that requested money from the Ministry of Culture.

5260,"&gt; This directive was passed over terror attacks. Are you clueless?

Did you completely drink the coolaid? Do you actually believe that a terror attack will somehow be fended off by an armed militia. The whole point of a terror attack isn't to have some straight up shoot up it's to inflict a great amount of damage due to the surprise. Even if you armed every person, they won't be walking around with guns ready at any given time.  
  
Do terror attacks happen? Yes. Are they terrible? Also yes. Are the people of Europe living in constant terror of another attack happening? No, most of us get on with our lives.
Is a bunch of people having rifles going to have any sort of negligible effect on a terrorist attack? No. Because if some lone nutter REALLY wants to kill a bunch of people, it turns out there isn't a great deal you can really do to stop them.

In addition, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has concluded that secondhand smoke is an occupational carcinogen (3).

5364,"&gt; There is plenty of criticism to be made on other issues such as the brutal obliteration of non Turks and non Turkish culture of Anatolia

Oh. This is why we have non Turks here. 

What Ataturk did was just a slight reform. He said ""How Happy Is the One Who Says, I Am a Turk!"". Not ""who is a Turk!""

So get your facts stragight.

&gt;Hitler was fascinated by the way Kemal handled Armenians and Greeks

&gt;bohoo Ataturk was literally Hitler

debunked already. if hitler admired Ataturk, it does not mean that Ataturk admired Hitler. Hitler was also inspired by Ancient Romans. 

&gt;I am not a fan of Mustafa Kemal for other reasons though

I think you are not a fan of him. Because he pretty much obliterated any hope of reviving the Byzantine Empire.

&gt;I don't care about attacking him. This whole discussion started with me pointing out the fact that Kemalist was a thing before 1923

and it wasn't. Not in 1919.

5383,"&gt; On 25 April 2019, after almost two hours of the Lublin Voivodeship Sejmik, the Lublin Voivode, Przemys≈Çaw Czarnek, spoke on 25 April 2019. It was then that the government representative on the ground referred to the subject of the debate, i.e. the position on LGBT ideology. He announced that if this project was adopted, he would invite the Presidium of the Sejm to a ceremony at the Lublin Voivodeship Office. - I will be able to honour the representatives of the Sejm with an appropriate medal and diploma in connection with the resolution that I hope you will adopt today - announced Przemys≈Çaw Czarnek.

&gt; These words mobilized not only Law and Justice councillors, but also members of the Polish People's Party club. 24 councillors, all from the Law and Justice party and the Polish Peasants' Party, voted in favour of adopting the LGBT position. Three representatives of the Civic Coalition voted against: Krzysztof Komorski, Krzysztof Grabczuk and Bo≈ºena Lisowska. The others did not take part in the vote.
LGBT guilty of paedophilia in church?

&gt; Today, the announced ceremony took place in the Lublin Voivodeship Office. In his speech, the Governor of Lublin stated that for a long time you can see ""a great total blow to the unity of the community of the Polish nation"". Whose fault was it? - It is Satan. Let us call a spade a spade a spade. If Satan wants to hit this community, it hits the family. If he destroys the family, he will destroy the nation,"" says Przemyslaw Czarnek.

&gt; The Governor thanked the local government for its opposition to the ""LGBT ideology, which is contrary to the Constitution of the Republic of Poland"". - They are lying in the streets and shouting ""constitution, constitution"" without seeing what is written in it and without seeing that this constitution has not been respected since 1997. For many years it did not care about the basic unit of the nation, which is the family - explains Czarnek.

&gt; At the end, the voivode referred to Tomasz Sekielski's film ""Tylko nie tell anyone"". In his opinion, there is no ""more hideous crime against a child than the crime of paedophilia"". He believes that the Church must stand up in truth and cleanse herself, but it is also necessary to find the reasons for such behaviour. - If we want to really act in defence of the family and the child, let us talk about this crime honestly. This is true when we say what is the role of homosexuality in this crime and why homosexuality is the main cause of paedophilia in the church,' the governor adds.

&gt; The first local government in the Lublin Province to take up such a position was the ≈öwidnica County. The representative of the district authorities stresses that there is no place for LGBT ideology in this area. - This ideology demands unjustified privileges for this minority group. These privileges would be implemented at the expense of the family. We remind you of the principles of law and good manners that apply in Poland - says Rados≈Çaw Brz√≥zka, a member of the board of the ≈öwidnica County.

&gt; The councillors of the Me≈Çgiew commune also stood up for the family and took the initiative to adopt such a position. The idea met with the support of the commune authorities. - The family is the basis for the functioning of our state. It is the foundation of the nation. It will strive to maintain this state of affairs,"" explains Magdalena W√≥jcik.

&gt; Today, the Lublin Voivode has distinguished nine local governments. Apart from the ≈öwidnicki District and the Me≈Çgiew Commune, the following medals were awarded: the Lublin Voivodeship Council, the city of Ostr√≥w Lubelski, the Rycki District, the city of ≈öwidnik, the city of Urzƒôd√≥w, the city of Wilko≈Çaz and the city of Zakrz√≥wek. On behalf of the Sejm, the medal was received by councillors of the Law and Justice party and the Polish Peasants' Party (PSL).",,/r/europe/comments/bqjpb2/polish_governor_awards_medals_for_the_fight/eo4zdn9/,c12xp,1558287810

5386,"&gt;If something is banned its more profitable for criminals to be in the gun selling business as  profit from it is greater.

It's also riskier and more expensive. A lot of the major drug trade, for example, relies on ""safe harbour"" countries to operate profitably. Which is why America's and Europe's drug problems are different: we have more ""padding"" between us and safe harbours with exceptions such as Albania's weed.  


\&gt; Everyday people are unlikely to just go ahead and commit crime.

&amp;#x200B;

Unlikely is the key word here. A 0.1% chance of someone selling their gun translates to a higher absolute numbers the larger the demographic with the factors of ""gun access"" and ""poverty"" increases. The probability never has to change, all you need is that demographic to get bigger. Liberalized gun laws do exactly that.  


\&gt; USA has bigger population and is not as homogeneous as Switzerland.  

&amp;#x200B;

The homogeny argument is complete trash. As if calling a country with 4 different seperate etho-linguistic communities  and 26 cantons with a lot of devolved powers such was anything but farcical to begin with. But economically, yes, America holds a lot more of the very rich and the very poor, and when guns are added to the mix the incentive to abuse a priviledge grows.",,/r/europe/comments/bqgmjz/swiss_voters_approve_tighter_gun_control/eo4zfn4/,InitialEstablishment,1558287840

A) See above response. B) England had to deal with all of that as well, as its northern neighbour was in a coalition against it alongside France, and it was both involved in multiple large conflicts on the mainland and was also under threat from France and Spain on many occasions.

5621,"Its nothing to do with being special, its an expensive event that UK taxpayers fund which frankly has lost all appeal, its a bunch of forgetable acts and a pointless voting stage. 

I mean its hard to work out what this costs for us as the BBC don't release the total figure but we paid ¬£310,000 in 2012 to the European Broadcasting Union, based on the BBCs own estimate in their commisioned tarrif structure ""premium entertainment"" price per hour is between ¬£400,000 - ¬£750,000. As much as we might wish it was, Eurovision is not a one day event, including the semi-finals and other broadcasts its at least a week even longer if you include the BBC funded extras, i mean you can easily be looking at a cost of between 4 to 7 million. Then we have our presenters, Grahmam nortons salary will likely be close, if not over, a millon for the entire event (based on his previous costs). Ontop of this you will probably have a bunch of other BBC introduced costs because they are the BBC. 

If you match this against the actual number of people who watch Eurovision is starts to get questionable, the  viewing numbers for the semi-finals were less than half a million last year, aside from the actual final event the numbers are attrocious. Even during the final event last years viewing numbers were around 6.73 million that makes up about 36% of the saturday night audience.

Hell from a financial perspective its a good job we don't win, when Azerbaijan hosted the contest in 2012 they spent ¬£48m and got back and estimated ¬£7m in tourism revenue. Copenhagen in 2014 spent ¬£36m and got back ¬£13m. The thing is a massive money pit and in a country like the UK where people are legally forced to pay for the state broadcaster the question of why we fund this thing should be addressed.

5629,"Well, the chancellor said he talked with the FP√ñ to see if they would be ready for some real restructuring, and had they been, he would have continued the coalition. As they are not, new elections will be held. 

Given this context, I don't see how a coalition with a new, ""restructured"" FP√ñ would represent the people more than a coalition with one or several of the parties the people actually voted for. But the FP√ñ didn't want to play ball, and Kurz did not reach out to one of the parties that did not have a scandal, but instead opted for new elections.

5893,"&gt; Tatars never were peaceful insular people but expansionist brutal raiders.

Why do you keep pushing this narrative and depiction against Tatars but not against your own ancestors? Slavs were no different. Tatars actually were peaceful, they built a nation for themselves, they built cities for themselves, they had a trade with other nations, they had their own culture, music, traditions, etc. Slavs on the other hand were invading and genociding everyone they could find. Look in the Balkans region. Many of the people in the Balkans who speak Slavic languages were forced to adopt Slavic by force. There is a reason why most the Slavic groups in the Balkan regions have no genetic relation to Slavic people like Ukrainians or Russians - they are genetically the most similar to Greeks, Albanians and other non-Slavic groups. In addition, besides attempting to wipe the locals, they stole the identity of these locals they enslaved or destroyed, such as the identity of Bulgars or Macedonians.

&gt;Russia is all what you wrote and more and it‚Äôs in big part heritage of Mongol-Turkic invasions and over 2 centuries rule.

I don't understand what you are saying here. Russians have nothing to do with Turkic people, and Turkic people are not related to Mongolian people. It is western ignorance that lumps Turkic people with Mongolian people. Just because Mongolians were able to conqueror some Turkic groups during the Golden Horde era doesn't make them related to one another.

The Crimean Tatars speak a Kipchak language, and the Kipchak-Cumans migrated to southern Ukraine in the 9th century. Here is even Ukraine's official encyclopedia from their government, read the entries:

http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CC%5CU%5CCumans.htm

5902,"&gt;Freedom of speech isnt defined because it sounds like a good rationale and jargong.

Freedom of speech is defined by the freedom to speak unhindered. 

&gt; It‚Äôs because we humans MUST voice our feelings and ideas, if we don‚Äôt they morph by themselves into festering axioms about reality that literally are dangerous. So yes on that point you are right. But, the motive is why it‚Äôs important, not the idea itself.

That is exactly why i'm for free speech

&gt; Therefore using the slogan by itself, freedom of speech, is a contradiction here. Because your freedom is to voice your opinion, not be over-shadowed by others because they can. If that is freedom of speech we are allowing power-dynamic in the sphere of social-sanctions to dictate what can be said or not.

You should be able to say anything you want. I should never be able to stop you from speaking. That is free speech. 

That is all i want. Nobody blocking me from speaking on equal terms. 

If more people want to listen to you, i'm fine with that as long as i am not censored. 

&gt; Freedom of speech is the right to have your book printed without the label retracting it because of demonstrations etc. But, in reality we are restricting the companys right to decide, in exchange for the motive behind freedom of speech.  
&gt;  
&gt; To have a right to be heard. In speech, writing and other forms.

freedom of speech is the freedom from censorship. 

&gt;This is at the heart of the crux. Many people itterate that you have a right to say what you want but you also have to take the consequences. And this is even justified under the guise of severe social sanctions. Which is a contradiction. Because this persons freedom of speech is being destroyed by psychologically chastising the individual. Making him/her unable to actually voice their opinion.

I don't care if you don't like me, i don't care if you don't share my sentiment. I care that you are not banned from reading what i just wrote, and i don't think you should be banned from calling me whatever you want.

5903,"Honestly dont take the generalisations personally. I can see the vast amount of residual history from christianity in my country even though it‚Äôs very secular. So I only extrapolate it how it would be if my country was actively religious in its identity. Me personally Im very interested in justice and law both studies and free-time so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so strenuous about details. 

My opinion about Israel isnt isolated. I see it in context to Palestine and I see Palestine in context to Israel. 

So individually I see despicable acts from Israeli individuals and Palestinian individuals. I also see state-wise acts that are clearly criticisable. 

The problem for me at its core is that Palestinians have their identity and needs that arnt meet, and arnt powerful enough to do real politics instead become squashed btw ideological battles and the reality of geopolitics in the region. Mean while Israelis need to defend themselves against the extremist elements among the islamists. Their history of the six-day war, hezbollah, Iran, rockets and suicide bombers are not any less real for them to safeguard their lifes and property. 

The settler issue for me is both a problem of politics and reality. From what I‚Äôve seen, there is the faction of Israelis that are clear cut they want to take land, while the middle ground is that they simply want to prospect and develop land. Meanwhile Ive also seen Palestinians who have old sheeds, living piss-poor. Who don‚Äôt wanna leave and get an apartment or such. Because it‚Äôs a man who wants to make himself and doesnt wanna learn and develop in fraction because they are Israelis and not Palestinians doing it.

5954,"Stolen from the worldnews thread: 

This is very misguided. Parents who raise their kids eating nonvegan diets can very well raise children with poor nutrition as well. I am a physician and I have seen children hospitalized for poor nutrition who are nonvegan. What is important is a balanced diet. We know that overall, a vegan and to a lesser extent a vegetarian diet is healthier than an omnivore diet in humans with less risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and some cancers. It is also better for the environment. What is important medically, like any diet is that the vegan diet is balanced. This can very well be done.
