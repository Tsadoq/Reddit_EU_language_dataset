Thanks to his friendship and collaboration with the marshal of the Carabinieri (italian gendarmes), he manages to sneak into legal and criminal cases and solve them thanks to a decisive clue, which very often comes from his innate intuition and his extensive knowledge of the human soul. Don Matteo is kind and helpful to everyone and shows an extraordinary capacity for loving the people involved in the case, even the murderers. His intrusions are not, however, very welcome by the captains who follow one another in the local Carabinieri barracks: they try to keep him away from the investigation, but in the end they always recognise the priest's skill.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/n94ef2/most_common_names_of_newborns_in_german_states/gxtx5t0/,zgido_syldg,1620807067

17,"What is grave about this situation, Messieurs, is that it is not serious’, was how General de Gaulle addressed his cabinet following the attempted putsch des généraux in April 1961. That could equally apply to recent Franco-British ructions over fishing rights in the Channel Islands. It is mere gesture politics, for all the French retaliatory threats to cut off the electricity supply to Jersey, the British dispatch of two Royal Navy vessels and the French countering with two patrol boats. Behind the facade France and Britain are serious military and diplomatic allies bound by important and wide-ranging security treaties that go beyond just Nato. But it is the French who have the most to lose were relations between Paris and London to deteriorate beyond the cosmetic.

Governments and regimes come and go, but a state’s foreign policy varies little for the simple reason that it is founded on geography and immutable geostrategic national interests. General de Gaulle never ceased calling ‘Russia’ by that name, even when it was the USSR, precisely because it was the same entity with at heart the same geostrategic interests. In that he was following the line of the great 19th century British foreign secretary, Lord Palmerston, when he reminded parliament that: ‘we have no eternal allies, and we have no perpetual enemies. Our interests are eternal and perpetual and those interests it is our duty to follow.’

Britain’s geostrategic interest is the open sea, international commerce and no hegemonic power in continental Europe. France shares the British fear of a hegemonic power in Europe — other than its own — whether it be 17th century Spain, 18th century Austria or, since 1871, Germany, whose unification was sealed on the back of French defeat. 

Subsequently, France looked to Britain as a counterweight to a dominant Germany constantly seeking an elusive binding peacetime military alliance with London. Disappointed in that quest, post-Suez France accelerated the alternative strategy for constraining German power: binding her ever more tightly in the French-controlled web of European integration, as I argued on Coffee House a year ago.

For as long as Germany was willing to play the game and pretend not to be powerful the European project satisfied France's vital interests. When on occasions Germany forsook her submissive role, at least after 1973 Paris could seek allegiance from Britain as a counterweight. But ever-ascending German economic, financial and, increasingly, political power lays bare France's relative decline in the EU. Now that Britain has left, France is cheek by jowl with Germany and fully conscious that her perpetual interest of denying a European hegemon is threatened.

President Macron’s risky strategy of accelerating the process of ever-deeper European integration has the advantage of denying Germany (but also France) sovereignty: the same Faustian pact that President Mitterrand sealed in Maastricht, fearful of the long-term consequences of German reunification after 1989. But the risk — as many in France know — is that continued French economic and financial decline will further loosen Paris's grip on the EU while tightening Berlin's. Germany risks becoming — reluctantly — the natural European hegemon that France has always feared.

The one significant domain where France has the upper hand over Germany is in the military and international fields, by dint of nuclear weapons, reactive and combatant armed forces and a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, none of which Germany has. In this France is similar to Britain. The century-old military association with Britain, albeit not a formal peacetime alliance, is a French force multiplier and insurance policy. Hence in recent times, the 1998 Saint-Malo declaration and the 2010 Lancaster House agreement both seriously irked Berlin.

This is why Paris has more to lose than London from a serious deterioration of their relations. Without this force multiplier, France would be hobbled internationally and eventually have little alternative but to throw her military lot in with Germany and the ‘political dwarf and military worm’ that is the EU. However much Macron might call for a European army he knows this will not happen in the next ten years, if ever.

Even Macron knows that it is in France’s ‘vital’ interest to maintain tight defence and security relations with Britain, as the most recent French defence white paper explicitly states. This is why — regardless of Brexit — Britain looms so large in Macron’s 2017 grand strategic review that seeks to pivot to the Indo-Pacific and why Macron was so looking forward to celebrating the tenth anniversary of the Lancaster House agreement last year. 

That treaty goes further on defence and security partnership (including nuclear weapons, advanced arms construction, joint force projection) than with any other European power. An example of this is Britain’s frontline support to France with heavy-lift helicopter capacity and crewing in the Sahel, where EU support is minimal. There is no way France would wish to jeopardise this strategic support and long term insurance policy.

It is always a popular pastime on both sides of the Channel to do some English or French bashing for domestic political reasons. But Paris should be reminded not to overstep the mark. Britain has not leveraged the Lancaster House agreement in any visible way but France is building up a lot of political debt. London should call in that debt soon.",,/r/europe/comments/najl0k/france_needs_britain_more_than_ever/gxtxbpp/,casualphilosopher1,1620807224

51,"A search of internet archives produces no record of Michel Barnier expressing sympathy with those who, in the run-up to the 2016 EU referendum, were concerned about immigration into the UK.

Which is odd, since, as well know, the most important quality of politicians of every stripe is consistency; adopting a different view on a controversial topic from the one you might have expressed before, in different circumstances, might suggest to voters that you are… well, hypocrite is a strong word. Let’s stick with inconsistent.

The radical proposal to end all non-EU immigration into France and to re-examine the Schengen “passport-free” travel zone in mainland Europe was unexpected from the man who led the commission’s negotiations with Britain after the vote to Leave. Those talks, you will recall, were defined by the cultural divide between Remainers, with their cosmopolitan, progressive, inclusive approach to life, and Leavers, with their racist prejudices, dodgy regional accents, their lack of university degrees, their love of whippet racing and, of course, their yearning for the days of Empire.

Oh, if only our misinformed compatriots would take the lead of someone like nice Mr Barnier, with his sophisticated French accent and his natural gallic tolerance and love for other cultures!

Tearful Remainers were yesterday removing posters of Barnier from their bedroom walls after the prospective candidate for his country’s presidency took a leaf out of Marie Le Pen’s book by hopping on the anti-immigrant bandwagon. Or maybe the posters stayed where they were: maybe intolerance is fine provided it’s expressed by the “right” kind of people and not riff-raff; you know, the kind of working class bigots who embarrass prime ministers during general election campaigns.

Perhaps the Conservative Party can sell Mr Barnier their old poster idea from 2005: “It’s not racist to impose limits on immigration”.

Barnier’s previous comments bear some re-examination too: “Being a member of the EU comes with rights and benefits,” he told journalists in December 2016. “The single market and its four freedoms (which includes freedom of movement) are indivisible. Cherry picking is not an option.”

In other words, Barnier is now proposing a wholesale restructuring of the single market, at least for France. And that would not be impossible under current treaty terms. So is he suggesting what I think he might be suggesting…?

No, he probably isn’t. All he’s doing is moving on. Barnier said one thing from 2016 to 2019 in order to put pressure on a recalcitrant Britain because it suited his political agenda to do so. And now that it suits him for political purposes to perform a volte-face (or whatever it’s called in France) he is doing and saying whatever it takes to win the support of his country’s main centre-right party and become president.

But it is such a dangerous, as well as cynical, move. Barnier hopes to outflank Marie Le Pen, currently Macron’s main rival for the Élysée, who has made much progress with her war on immigration. But by parking his tank on her lawn, as it were, Barnier is merely confirming that she has a point. In a single statement he has increased Le Pen’s credibility and, perhaps, her electability.

Britain has made much more of a success than France of multiculturalism and integration. Problems exist but extremists like Le Pen have never made much progress in mainstream politics, and debates about immigration – like the one we were almost allowed to have in 2016 – usually happen in a less febrile atmosphere. Even so, Remainers do love to dismiss all such concerns as xenophobia or worse. Legitimate fears over jobs, wages, housing and local services are dismissed: why can’t these people stop moaning and go relax in their Tuscan fixer-upper like everyone else?

Will Barnier now become a non-person, disowned by those who still yearn for Britain’s triumphant return to the EU’s embrace? Even they will have their doubts. Not only can we no longer be sure if Barnier was actually negotiating in good faith with the UK, if he gets his way and actually wins the presidency, he could open the way to France – France! – leaving the bloc.

There is an alternative history to be speculated about: had this damascene conversion happened a few years earlier, maybe the commission would have expressed more sympathy with Britain and exerted more energy to address some of the failings of the single market and the social tensions that freedom of movement was having in Britain and – it turns out – beyond it.

But those problems are no longer ours to fix. The UK has a vested interest in the success of the European Project. We just never expected its next threat to come from this direction.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/najpdt/barniers_volteface_on_immigration_shouldnt_come/gxtxwgb/,CallsOutFash,1620807771

64,"&gt;are fighting poverty and homelessness too, with social housing programs

I'm gonna assume you're talking about social democracy's here, and yes, they are very skilled in combatting poverty and homelessness there. However, they still perpetrate the poverty and homelessness in regions such as Africa or Latin America. Poverty and exploitation are outsourced to the Global South.

&gt;And yeah, in countries with free market, you have recessions, but then economy booms again

After large-scale wars, killing thousands to millions and destroying the infrastructure and stability of a nation. A system that is dependant on people dying en mass in order to avoid total economic collapse is a bad system.

&gt;In the countries occupied by the Red Army, whether Russia or East Germany, you had daily bread lines instead

Once again, I'm not the biggest fan of the USSR or PRC, however, they did combat poverty and homelessness quite well. I'm not gonna defend bread lines, at least the ones post-WW2 reconstruction, and I'm not gonna defend the USSR's authoritarianism. Because I'm not a Soviet fanatic. However, I'd rather be in food lines than not fed at all, as the homeless are in the US, or being fed unhealthy, fattening foods, and then sold a prescription for diabetes that I could have avoided outright.",USA,/r/europe/comments/n9f7r4/romanian_anticommunist_fighter_december_1989/gxtxzea/,RegalKiller,1620807853

Europe’s phantom political centre risks fuelling populism
New coalitions and electoral strategies disguise opportunism and an absence of ideological substance


CATHERINE FIESCHI - The author is founder and chief executive of the research and advisory group Counterpoint

In Europe, the idea of the political centre has never been so fashionable. Centrism seems to be the balm of choice to soothe the populist wounds of European democracies.

President Emmanuel Macron of France kicked it off in 2017, and a coalition spanning the political centre looms in Germany. As for Italy, prime minister Mario Draghi’s national unity government is doing all it can to erase the very notion of partisanship. But does this centre have any ideological substance? 

A year of pandemic pressure has done much to explode conservative financial orthodoxies, leftwing scepticism about elites and populist suspicions of EU institutions. European political parties were pried from their respective centres of gravity under a mortal threat. But the collective surrender to an expedient, rather than an ideologically meaningful, centre predates the pandemic. 

In part, it is the result of the much-peddled story of the demise of the left-right divide. But mostly, it is the result of political opportunism: a convenient way for parties to tread water as electorates are transformed under the weight of tectonic shifts, be they digital, environmental or geopolitical. As voters adapt, float and flit and as values shift (or not), parties hunker down and wait. What better place to do so than in the non-committal centre?

Macron was elected in 2017 in part because he was savvy enough to seize the political day — and everyone else’s political twilight. He made the most of an imploding French political class by inhabiting the relatively safe and utterly malleable political centre.

Four years later the ideological hollowness of Macron’s line is obvious, as is his party’s fantasy of the centre. When probed, French voters still identify with left-right values. Suspicion of liberalism, regularly confused with neoliberalism, runs deep. Constructing a coherent centrist position will take a lot more work than Macron has put in. 

Germany’s next coalition, in which the Greens appear almost certain to figure, could be the next centrist vortex. The professionalised Green leadership is determined to rule out no one from their big tent, aside from the rightwing populist Alternative for Germany. In a land of “grand coalitions”, the combination of the end of the Angela Merkel era, restive voters and a shaken transatlantic relationship demand a form of continuity of which the Greens may be the unlikely providers.

Italy has been plagued by polarisation, having veered wildly from an improbable alliance of left and right populists in 2018 to a no less unstable government of left populists and social democrats. Now, thanks to the hubris of its political leaders and the deft manoeuvring of President Sergio Mattarella, the country has ended up with Draghi’s entirely implausible government of national unity.

On the face of things, it borders on the miraculous. Draghi is respected at home and abroad and comes with no partisan strings attached. The result is near-unanimous support. Even the hard-right League’s Matteo Salvini joined this unabashedly centrist Europhile alliance. The unity signals a resolve to access the EU’s post-pandemic recovery funds, but also a desperate drive towards an ever-receding equilibrium.

But does old Europe ever really “do” centrism as more than indecision? True, in the consensual Nordic democracies, compromise is a political value. But is there a centrist European tradition of which to be a part, or is everything merely a timid “third way” — reflected at EU level in matters such as its relationships with China and the US? 

With the help of the liberal political tradition, which is thinner elsewhere in Europe, the UK’s Liberal Democrats probably came closest. But there, too, the party was essentially an aggregate of voters on the left and right that created the illusion of a centrist position. The party’s struggles testify to the difficulty in being more than a ballast for either of the other two big parties.

As for central and eastern Europe, one distinguishing factor is the political mirage of a centrist liberalism in which western powers encouraged the region to place its faith from the 1990s. This precipitated a style of politics defined not by a left-right spectrum, but by a populism whose suspicion of liberal elites shows no signs of waning. 

Some might argue that the centre, whether real or imagined, is no bad place to aim for and we should be relieved. But the paradox is that, in its meaninglessness, this phantom centre may fuel precisely the kind of ersatz consensus that triggered the great populist backlash to begin with — in both east and west. ",Europe,/r/europe/comments/nai33q/europes_phantom_political_centre_risks_fuelling/gxtpzde/,eenachtdrie,1620800714

164,"&gt;Okay so literally every example of people actually trying to apply communist theories to society were not ""real communism"" according to you? 

There have been socialists that weren't marxist leninists. They pursued communism, long-term. 

Unfortunately, the CIA has always attacked socialists, so only the most authoritarians backed by the soviets survived. 

So there's a reason why all your ""actually trying to apply communism"" countries had a clear ideological cut towards authoritarianism that made it nearly impossible for them to achieve that communist objectives. 

&gt;This is the fundamental paradox of modern day commies ""none of those countries were communist! But let me spend all day arguing on the internet arguing why they are also super good and succesfull!""

I'm not a tankie. 
I didn't say those countries were super good or very successful.
Like every country ever, they have some good and some bad stuff. Some countries have more bad or more good than others.

In practice, this capitalist countries had a local discourse of being socialist or working for the people. 
So to keep this narrative, they had to appear consistent and help around the world by supporting decolonization and sending aid to developing countries.

Industrial Policy Saved Europe’s Vaccine Drive
The EU got its act together not by banning exports but through classic cooperation with industry.

By Caroline de Gruyter, a Europe correspondent for the Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad and a columnist at Foreign Policy.

In March, Europe’s vaccine procurement was the world’s laughingstock. The Europeans were far behind the Americans, the British, and the Israelis in obtaining vaccines and administering them to citizens. But now, the critics are falling silent. European countries are vaccinating in record numbers, all more or less at the same pace.

Europe is catching up fast because it has completely turned around the way it does business in the health sector. It used to be an open system where goods and services flowed in and out freely; it is now more controlled and more European. By setting up a real industrial policy, and investing in it, Europeans managed to guarantee a steady supply of vaccines. The idea that an industrial policy helps, long taboo in Europe, is now here to stay—and not just for vaccines.

When AstraZeneca announced in January that it could only deliver a third of its promised doses in the first quarter of 2021, the European Commission got all the flak. The commission, which was asked by the 27 member states to buy vaccines for all, had been too slow, critics said. The European Commission supposedly focused too much on the price of vaccines and too little on exclusive delivery. In the meantime, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Israel elbowed their way to those vaccines, leaving the Europeans in the cold. High time, many said, for Europe to flex its geopolitical muscle.

But Brussels soon discovered that the problem was not so much bad contracts or slow negotiating but the fact that no one in Europe had oversight over complex supply chains. It wasn’t that Europe lacked the production capacity to fulfill its own orders or that its share of production was being shipped elsewhere. The problem was the production process was breaking down within Europe. It was a problem that industrial policy was designed to solve—so long as industrial policy was something the European Union was capable of doing.

Often, even vaccines produced in Europe and destined for Europe must cross many borders before they are ready to use. Components are sourced all over the world. Assemblage is done in several countries. Often, vaccines are shipped abroad again for bottling. Until February, these complex chains were hardly monitored at all in Europe. It took a pandemic—when governments want to get vaccines at all costs—to show how vulnerable this system is.

In February, in response to the public outcry over AstraZenaca’s failure to deliver what it had promised, Thierry Breton, the European commissioner for the internal market, set up a vaccine procurement taskforce. The first thing he realized, he told the French podcast Le Nouvel Esprit Public, was that the EU had had “extraordinarily liberal and Anglo-Saxon policies” for decades.

The European single market, designed in the 1980s, centered on customers. The idea was that customers mechanically profit from free market forces and fierce competition, resulting in lower prices and better quality. The role of government was limited to ensuring and monitoring the level playing field. There had always been strong support in the commission for industrial policies that would protect Europe’s industry and make it more competitive. The problem was not so much the substance of such policies but the fear by member states of a multinational power grab by the commission. When it was really unavoidable, as it was for the steel industry, they accepted it—resulting in the Davignon plan, which protected and restructured European steel manufacturers heavily hit by an economic crisis in the 1970s.

It took a pandemic to accept that the scope of such policies must be wider. (The fact that this coincided with Britain’s departure from the EU, and the appointment of an internal market commissioner from France, is simply coincidence.) No one, it turned out, had previously had oversight over the production of the hundreds of millions of vaccines that the commission had ordered. U.S. policymakers were doing business with vaccine producers, researchers, and producers, working toward a good output. In Europe, there was very little coordination. All the parts of the chain were acting independently. Vaccine doses were flowing in and out of the internal market without anyone keeping track.

Breton started to visit factories, mapping bottlenecks. He soon found out that several supply chains were disrupted, with no one doing anything to fix the problems. He had to act fast. The commission had been assigned to do all vaccine procurement on behalf of member states. Last summer, when no one knew when which vaccines would be available, it had placed orders with six producers to spread risks—if one pharmaceutical company could not deliver in time, there were always five others in the field. Member states had asked the commission to do this for them. If all would buy their own vaccines, big countries with larger budgets (or factories on their territory) would get there first. Smaller and poorer countries would end up at the back of the line. This would disrupt the internal market and put internal relations under unbearable political strain. If all would get vaccines at the same time, for the same prices, disaster could be averted.


This Is Europe’s Vaccine Rollout Going According to Plan
Member states are shirking responsibility for the system they designed—even when they’re the primary beneficiaries.

AstraZeneca produced one of the first vaccines in Europe. But the supply chain system could not cope with mass production under stress. Immediately, there were hitches. Supply was lower than the company had planned. Some governments started pushing it around, forcing it to move production to their territory or forbidding it to export to others. All companies were under similar strain. Israel, for instance, secured its vaccines by handing over personal data of citizens in exchange for guaranteed delivery of doses, at the expense of other countries.

Meanwhile, vaccines freely flowed in and out of Europe. This was not a problem as such. Today, like several months ago, Europe exports more than 40 percent of vaccines produced on its soil. The difference now is that supply has become so ample that even with exports totaling 40 percent of production, Europeans have more than enough for themselves. And they will have more than enough from now on. But Europe, a large exporter of vaccines, is not eager to join the vaccine patent waiver proposed by the United States. European leaders say sending finished doses to countries in need, as they do, is faster and more efficient than a patent waiver: A waiver just means developing countries get the right to reproduce vaccines, but they still don’t have the “recipe.”

Breton is a hands-on former industrialist, whose credo is that “if I run faster than others and they want to keep up with me, they all run in my direction.” He sleeps five hours a night and says he phones vaccine producers every day—starting with AstraZeneca’s CEO, a Frenchman living in Australia. The first thing Breton did after the AstraZeneca debacle was to create oversight over the entire vaccine production process. All exports, both of finished vaccines and components, had to be vetted by him—not to block them (he never did) but to get an overview: What went where? This is how he managed to avert a second disaster.

This time, it involved Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines. By insisting that all export requests must pass through his desk, Breton discovered that J&amp;J vaccines, although produced in Europe (by Janssen, in the Dutch city of Leiden), had to be bottled in the United States before returning to Europe. But the U.S. Defence Production Act severely restricted exports. The chance J&amp;J vaccines would make it back to Europe to be administered was small.

So the European Commission interfered. A German bottling plant for dengue vaccines was temporarily repurposed for J&amp;J. Now the vaccines do not need a detour to the United States anymore. Better even, they are delivered faster.

The commission is also ramping up investments in vaccine development and production. With German and European money, the vaccine-maker BioNTech bought another factory in Germany, moving parts of the production process back to Europe. The company is now less vulnerable to hitches in the production chain. It is also more productive. In April, the commission secured extra BioNTech-Pfizer doses for the second quarter. It also ordered another 1.8 billion doses  through 2023.

In March and April, scorn from all corners of Europe, and beyond, rained down on Brussels. Some called it a “mess,” and others wrote that the “vaccine disaster is the death rattle of the EU” or thought Commission President Ursula von der Leyen should resign over this “shambles.” The harshest commentary came from the U.K., which was, by mid-April, injecting twice as fast as Europe, proudly opening pubs again. But actually, at least half of the 40 million doses the U.K. had administered by then came straight from factories in Europe—mostly BioNTech. Vaccines produced in U.K. factories for use in the EU, though, were blocked because of the country’s export ban.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/nahvru/industrial_policy_saved_europes_vaccine_drive_the/gxtqeym/,eenachtdrie,1620801071
168,"2/2

In the end, Europe developed a five-to-six-week delay in vaccinating citizens, compared with the United States, the U.K., and Israel. Europeans, eager to restart their lives and businesses, loathed those delays, putting their governments under pressure.

Although national governments bear responsibility for the lack of Europe’s industrial policy in the past, some put all the blame on Brussels and went out to buy vaccines themselves. Hungary, for example, bought Russian vaccines, although they have not been approved by the European Medicines Agency yet—and probably will not be for some time. Breton spoke with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban at length and visited Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, too. He asked Kurz what he and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen had done on a highly publicized “vaccine trip” to Israel. Kurz supposedly answered: “Not much.”

By now, criticism of EU vaccine procurement has almost stopped. Vaccination rates have accelerated everywhere. Apart from Hungary and Malta, which are ahead, and Croatia, Latvia, and Bulgaria, which lag behind, most participants are moving ahead at the same speed. This common pace was the idea behind common procurement.

Member states obtained 14 million doses in January, 28 million in February, 60 million in March, and 105 million in April. The commission expects 125 million doses in May and 200 million in June, putting the bloc on track to have an annual capacity of 3 billion to 4 billion doses. Even when new vaccines become available, Breton said, Europe doesn’t need them. There are now 53 manufacturing sites in Europe, up from barely a dozen in January. According to Breton, “We should be proud of Europe’s industrial capacity.” His boss, von der Leyen, said Europe has used this crisis to reinvent itself and become stronger, as happened repeatedly in the past. She called Europe, still exporting almost half of its vaccine output, “the pharmacy of the world.”

The commission sees the vaccine procurement saga as a test case. Last week, it proposed more EU protection for other sectors vulnerable to (geo)political weaponization and to make the single market more resilient to supply restrictions, border closures, or fragmentation in the future. Fierce discussions are expected with some of Europe’s strongest free market defenders, such as the Netherlands. But even The Hague has by now accepted that European “strategic autonomy” and industrialization policy have become key concepts to be developed in an increasingly mercantile world.

201,"To prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world have taken a variety of restrictive measures since the beginning of 2020. The air transport industry was hit immediately and the most recent figures on commercial flights show no clear signs of recovery in April 2021.  
  
The first impact on commercial air transport was visible in March 2020, with a 44% decrease in the total number of commercial flights in the EU compared with the same month in 2019. With COVID-19 restrictions in full effect and changes in travel preferences, the most substantial falls in the number of commercial flights were recorded in April (-91% compared with the same month in 2019), May (-90%) and June (-84%).  
  
During the peak summer months, there was only a partial recovery, with falls of 64% in July and 53% in August, with further decreases observed in September (-59%), October (-62%), November (-68%) and December (-67%). The first months of 2021 showed no signs of recovery: January (-68% compared with same month in 2019), February (-73%), March (-71%) and April (-70%).  
  
**Paris/Charles de Gaulle: highest drop in the number of commercial flights in April 2021**  
Following unprecedented decreases in the number of commercial flights in 2020, the pandemic continued to impact a vast majority of EU airports in the first months of 2021.  
In April 2021, the largest decreases in the number of commercial flights were recorded in major European air transport hubs: Paris/Charles de Gaulle (-28 300 commercial flights compared with April 2019, -67%), Amsterdam/Schiphol (-28 200, -67%), Frankfurt/Main (-28 000, -65%) and München (-27 300, -81%).",Romania,/r/europe/comments/nag4gr/commercial_air_transport_in_the_eu_no_clear_signs/gxter5j/,filosoful,1620792785

I mention the abuse of pills because it is another example of unhealthy environmental condition where something could/should be done.

We're what happens when the universe expands into existence, the energy forms into stars, the stars create elements, and the elements create organic matter. All of us were all of that, together. We still are.


Because we have separate minds and control separate bodies, we assume we are separate in nature. We're not, though. We're all the same big bang with temporary biological universe-experiencing-meat-suits that trick us into believing in separation. At least, that's the take in Zen, which I think is a wise take:


""This comes when that goes. 

That arises when this sinks. 

Understand both as originally one emptiness. 

In emptiness the two are the same

To abide in this world

Just say “Not two.”

“Not two” includes everything,

Excludes nothing.

All is one.

Another clause stipulated that Germany would not interfere with the Soviet Union's actions towards Bessarabia, which was then part of Romania.[102] As a result, Bessarabia and also Northern Bukovina and Hertza regions were occupied by the Soviets and integrated into the Soviet Union.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/nab57o/on_june_7_1939_latvia_and_estonia_signed/gxt3o1l/,duisThias,1620786519

And while maybe people don't care about burning North Macedonia, the EU has to engage in agreements with other countries too.

Credibility isn't an absolute requirement to function as a political entity, but it can be awfully useful if you can have other parties rely on your word rather than having to arrange for assurances.

My strong suspicion is that the credibility involved is more-useful to the EU than a renamed Macedonia.

I don't have a strong opinion on whether the EU should accept North Macedonia.

Don’t get me wrong, they often have thoughts of harming others, but not really doing it. Mass shooters have a particular combination of traits, like scoring high on the dark triad, which comes in addition to their suicidal ideation, which makes them far more likely to do this.

486,"It's important to remember and know the these places also has corruption! It may look differently and talk differently but there is corruption everywhere in the world.

However, there are different levels of acceptance of corruption. And that's where cultural aspects play in to various degrees.

I can only really speak for Scandinavia and the Nordics out of your examples but it's a region that has had a very special form of democratic socialism and ""greater good"" mindset for a very long time as a result of the socialist hold of the region. With this comes a low level of acceptance for anyone ""getting their dues"" or ""getting ahead"" and individualistic gains which has lead to an overall low level of acceptance of corruption as the ""has / has not"" mindset hasn't grown as strong. 

This is not set in stone though and things are changing as a result of many factors. As the socioeconomic divides increase, or even just the perception amongst people, so does the acceptance of corruption. Because why shouldn't you deserve to get a little extra and bend the rules for once if you feel like others have it better than you?

However, the view that there is no corruption is definitely wrong - there are just different forms to different degrees compared to other regions.

There are similarities that can be drawn to Japan as the Nordics are a fairly conservative region, just not from what most people associate conservativism with. In Japan conservativism means following the social structure and rules that keep people obeying authority and is closer to classic western conservativism, where as in the Nordics socialist democracy is the conservative value and what has been the system in power for a majority of recent history. Any system that's left in power over a long time breeds corruption but it just takes different form.

550,"Not by our standards today. We sure not make that comparison, because At about the same time that popular government was introduced in Greece, it also appeared on the Italian Peninsula in the city of Rome. The Romans called their system a rēspūblica, or republic, from the Latin rēs, meaning thing or affair, and pūblicus or pūblica, meaning public—thus, a republic was the thing that belonged to the Roman people, the populus romanus. Remember SPQR:

""Senatus Populus Que Romanus"".. The Senate and the People of Rome.

It was a Republic for a long time before the Ceasars, and Emperors. 

*""Its political organization developed at around the same time direct democracy did in Ancient Greece, with collective and annual magistracies, overseen by a senate. The top magistrates were the two consuls, who had an extensive range of executive, legislative, judicial, military, and religious powers. Even though a small number of powerful families (called gentes) monopolised the main magistracies, the Roman Republic is generally considered one of the earliest examples of representative democracy""*

And

*""The legal status of Roman citizenship was limited and was a vital prerequisite to possessing many important legal rights such as the right to trial and appeal, to marry, to vote, to hold office, to enter binding contracts, and to special tax exemptions. An adult male citizen with the full complement of legal and political rights was called ""optimo jure."" The optimo jure elected their assemblies, whereupon the assemblies elected magistrates, enacted legislation, presided over trials in capital cases, declared war and peace, and forged or dissolved treaties. There were two types of legislative assemblies. The first was the comitia (""committees""),\[181\] which were assemblies of all optimo jure. The second was the concilia (""councils""), which were assemblies of specific groups of optimo jure.\[182\]*  
*Citizens were organized on the basis of centuries and tribes, which would each gather into their own assemblies. The Comitia Centuriata (""Centuriate Assembly"") was the assembly of the centuries (i.e., soldiers). The president of the Comitia Centuriata was usually a consul. The centuries would vote, one at a time, until a measure received support from a majority of the centuries. The Comitia Centuriata would elect magistrates who had the imperium powers (consuls and praetors). It also elected censors. Only the Comitia Centuriata could declare war, and ratify the results of a census.\[183\] It also served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases.*  
*The assembly of the tribes (i.e., the citizens of Rome), the Comitia Tributa, was presided over by a consul, and was composed of 35 tribes. The tribes were not ethnic or kinship groups, but rather geographical subdivisions.\[184\] The order that the thirty-five tribes would vote in was selected randomly by lot.\[185\] Once a measure received support from a majority of the tribes, the voting would end. While it did not pass many laws, the Comitia Tributa did elect quaestors, curule aediles, and military tribunes.\[186\] The Plebeian Council\[187\] was identical to the assembly of the tribes, but excluded the patricians. They elected their own officers, plebeian tribunes and plebeian aediles. Usually a plebeian tribune would preside over the assembly. This assembly passed most laws, and could also act as a court of appeal""*

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman\_Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic)

And..

*""Romans created a political structure so complex and idiosyncratic that later democratic leaders chose not to emulate it. The Romans used not only an extremely powerful Senate but also four assemblies, each called comitia (“assembly”) or concilium (“council”). The Comitia Curiata was composed of 30 curiae, or local groups, drawn from three ancient tribus, or tribes; the Comitia Centuriata consisted of 193 centuries, or military units; the Concilium Plebis was drawn from the ranks of the plebes, or plebeians (common people); and the Comitia Tributa, like the Athenian Assembly, was open to all citizens. In all the assemblies, votes were counted by units (centuries or tribes) rather than by individuals; thus, insofar as a majority prevailed in voting, it would have been a majority of units, not of citizens""...*

620,"&gt; No they weren't. The reds in the civil war wanted a **communist** country. Socialist *democrats* , as in the name, wanted to keep a democracy

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist\_democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_democracy)

I'm not sure if you are really finn, and you are talking serious, or trolling.

&gt;You're just showing everyone that you know nothing about the finnish people. 

Why would people symphathising reds call Jagers ""heroes""? 

For some they are traitors and butchers.

Just like Mannerheim - for some hero, for some traitor, for some coward, for some brave man, depends heavily on political positon, but if you try to look objectively - that's something in the middle.

Where is his monument placed outside of town? In Tampere, if i remember correctly?

&gt;you have not provided evidence of this

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;For example, the Pepteinen Joint Stock Company donated 10,000 Finnish marks to the ""Karelians"". The ""Society of Landowners"" ... was one of the organizers of the collection of ""donations"" in favor of the Whites who were operating in Karelia. Banker Tkaska, until the very last days of the White-Finnish intervention in Karelia, formed detachments in the hope of continuing the Karelian adventure. The main supplier of bandits was the Gutzeit &amp; Co. joint-stock company of Helsingfors, headed by Svinhuvud and other persons close to the government. **Half of the shares of this company were owned by the government**"" (31).  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;""Before preparing for the invasion of Karelia, the Gutzeit &amp; Co. had made a contract with England to supply the latter with 1 million telegraph poles, a batch of logs and mast timber. The joint-stock company was going to fulfill this contract from the forests of Soviet Karelia. The advance payment received from England for the deliveries was used to finance the Karelian venture. In addition, the joint-stock company provided horses and premises at Lieksa and Pankakoski for the needs of the detachments preparing to enter Karelia, and also employed the ""White Karelian government""   
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;During November 1921 3 million cartridges with the brand of the Finnish weapon factory ""Rahimäki"" were transferred to Karelia from Sveaborg Fortress.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Finn, captured in the battle near Länder, described how the recruitment took place. The captive said that ""the recruitment was entrusted to the chiefs of the Guard District, and each guard detachment was to send 25 Guardsmen to the ranks of the 'rebels'. .... In advance, the head of the security guard had to obtain a guarantee of the political trustworthiness of the recruit from the pastor and the Lensmann.... Only after that he sent him to Serdobol at the disposal of the Serdobol Guard District. From there he and other recruits were sent to Lieksa station to the order of the station master, who sent them to the head of the secret transfer point Skugen (Finnish officer), situated 2 km far from Lieksa station. After getting food, they were sent to the border, which they crossed without problems through the Finnish customs in the region of Kokojärvi, 35 versts east of Lieksa station. At the same time, two carts with rifles and one machine gun and several carts with foodstuffs were let through at the same point. The prisoner was armed in the village of Lendery""  
&gt;  
&gt;Another captured White-Finnish bandit told as follows: ""In Helsingfors we visited the headquarters of the Schutzkorps, where Major Lemberg signed us up in the squad that was being formed. There we were also issued with a rifle, 200 cartridges, a knapsack, new uniforms and other soldier's equipment. Those who did not have Lappish boots received them from the Helsingforski Relief Committee of Eastern Karelia, which also gave out underwear and money. From Helsingfors, 15 volunteers went via Viborg, Serdobol to Lieksa. Here the local head of the schutzkorps took us to a cafe, where we were allowed to drink and eat as much as we liked, free of charge. We spent the night at the cafe, and the next morning we took the highway to the Russian border. On arrival at the border post we were again given the weapons we were lacking, and there we were given detailed instructions on how to behave when crossing the border. We were told that we should tell the border guard that we were Karelians and were returning home. When crossing the border the sergeant who was inspecting our belongings pretended that he had not noticed the rifles in the sledge""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's literally on the wikipedia page, Former Russian Imperial Army 7,000–10,000\[2\].

 There's literally written:

&gt;Around 50,000 of the former czar's army troops were stationed in Finland in January 1918. The soldiers were demoralised and war-weary, and the former serfs were thirsty for farmland set free by the revolutions. The majority of the troops returned to Russia by the end of March 1918. In total, 7,000 to 10,000 Red Russian soldiers supported the Finnish Reds, but only around 3,000, in separate, smaller units of 100–1,000 soldiers, could be persuaded to fight in the front line.\[65\]  
&gt;  
&gt;The revolutions in Russia divided the Soviet army officers politically and their attitude towards the Finnish Civil War varied. Mikhail Svechnikov led Finnish Red troops in western Finland in February and Konstantin Yeremejev Soviet forces on the Karelian Isthmus, while other officers were mistrustful of their revolutionary peers and instead co-operated with General Mannerheim, in disarming Soviet garrisons in Finland.

Why am I arguing with someone who not only search for sources, but doesn't read further than headline at all? 

&gt;Obviously, because it was the **finnish** civil war.

Then stop pretending that Reds were RSFSR agents. 

&gt;It was the grand duchy of Finland

Duchy isn't a country, it's a region that is part of country. 

Statement remains - it was literally their country.

635,"&gt; Actually, that makes it a perfect example of what I initialy meant. A Country does not need multiculturalism to adopt traits from other countries to modernize itself.

Well, considering that the result of that was a doubling down on Japanese exceptionalism that led them to utter ruin in the 30s and 40s... I actually think it's not a great example.

&gt;How is that not what happened? The Han-Chinese were forbidden from entering Manchuria during the earlier Qing-Emperors. This ban was lifted in 1859, which started what was called ""chuang guandong"" - storm over the eastern pass - which saw large scale settlements mainland chinese settlers in Manchuria, that saw the Manchus eventually become a minority in their homeland.

They were always a minority in their homeland, because that homeland at the time was China. What happened was they attempted to react to the changing world by doubling down on their existing strategies and organization. 

Machu aren't irrelevant because Manchuria is now majority Han. That was always going to happen. The fact that they ever tried to stop it, and attempted to maintain their distinctness, is precisely why they failed.

Undoubtedly they were very different from Rome in 270BC. But any state will change a lot over time. They were however a direct continuation of the Empire. It's not like Sassanid Persia or Safavid Persia were much like the ancient Achaemenid Persia either.

&gt;La décision contestée par Bayer AG est ancienne puisqu’elle date de 2013.  
&gt;  
&gt;Les substances actives *clothianidine* et imidaclopride appartiennent aux néonicotinoïdes. Des incidents se sont produits  autour des années 2010 concernant la mauvaise utilisation de ces  produits entraînant des pertes de colonies d’abeilles. Plusieurs études  ont alors été faites mettant en lumière les effets sublétaux de ces  substances sur les abeilles. Deux études de l’*European Food Safety Authority* (EFSA), un avis de mai 2012 et une étude conclusive de janvier 2013 ([Communiqué de presse de l’EFSA du 16 janvier 2013 : L’EFSA identifie les risques associés aux néonicotinoïdes pour les abeilles](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/fr/press/news/130116)), identifiant un risque aigu pour les abeilles en raison de leur exposition à ces produits, ont été réalisées ([EFSA, Santé des abeilles](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/fr/topics/topic/bee-health)).  
&gt;  
&gt;C’est dans ces conditions que la Commission a adopté le 24 mai 2013 un règlement édictant non seulement l’interdiction de « *toute utilisation non professionnelle à l’intérieur ou à l’extérieur* », ou l’interdiction des utilisations « *pour le traitement des semences ou des sols* » sur un certain nombre de céréales entre janvier et juin, mais aussi l’interdiction des traitements foliaires pour un certain nombre de céréales et l’interdiction des utilisations « *pour le traitement des semences, traitement du sol ou les applications foliaires pour une centaine de cultures* » ([Interdictions reprises dans le préambule du Communiqué de presse du Tribunal de l’Union européenne concernant l’arrêt du 17 mai 2018](https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2018-05/cp180068fr.pdf)).  
&gt;  
&gt;L’article 2 de ce règlement interdit l’utilisation et la mise sur le marché des semences de cultures traitées avec ces produits[\[12\]](https://www.actu-environnement.com/blogs/corinne-lepage/77/interdiction-neonicotinoides-cour-justice-europeenne-tranche-faveur-principe-precaution-457.html#_ftn12).  
&gt;  
&gt;Bayer CropScience AG et Syngenta Crop Protection AG ont formé un  recours devant le Tribunal de l’Union européenne soutenu par un certain  nombre d’associations d’agriculteurs. Le Tribunal a rejeté cette requête  par une décision en date du 17 mai 2018[\[13\]](https://www.actu-environnement.com/blogs/corinne-lepage/77/interdiction-neonicotinoides-cour-justice-europeenne-tranche-faveur-principe-precaution-457.html#_ftn13).  
&gt;  
&gt;C’est contre cet arrêt que s’est pourvu Bayer CropScience AG,  soutenue par un certain nombre d’associations d’agriculteurs, contre des  associations de défense de l’environnement, notamment *Pesticide Action Network* (PAN)[\[14\]](https://www.actu-environnement.com/blogs/corinne-lepage/77/interdiction-neonicotinoides-cour-justice-europeenne-tranche-faveur-principe-precaution-457.html#_ftn14) intervenant en soutien de la Commission. Entre-temps un nouveau règlement d’exécution n° 2018/783 du 29 mai 2018[\[15\]](https://www.actu-environnement.com/blogs/corinne-lepage/77/interdiction-neonicotinoides-cour-justice-europeenne-tranche-faveur-principe-precaution-457.html#_ftn15),  beaucoup plus sévère en ce qui concerne l’interdiction de  l’imidaclopride et du clothianidine, est intervenu mais cette décision  n’a pas été contestée par Bayer AG.  
&gt;  
&gt;L’arrêt du 6 mai 2021, répondant donc à ce dernier pourvoi de Bayer  CropScience AG, est particulièrement étayé avec 185 points examinés.

751,"&gt;We didn't really have it better though. Our economy was much better managed under the free state than it ever was under the British, and we were treated a hell of a lot better. Look at how poorly the north is doing compared to the republic nowadays. It used to be the economic powerhouse of ireland.

Ireland for the majority of its history was poorer than NI and an economic backwater, but that's besides the point, no it wasn't better for the ten years between 1916 to 1926, Ireland had been wracked by a rebellion, an insurgency then a civil war and the partition of the island. So for the ten years before 16 years before 1916, you definitely had it better off. 

&gt;As for our conflicts, they were pretty tame affairs as far as wars go. About 5,000 died in the war of independence and civil war combined. Which is nothing compared to the amount of Irish people killed in British conflicts. WW1 alone killed about 50,000 irishmen.

Pretty tame, who are you trying to kid, the whole upheaval of the old order resulted in civil war and large scale migration and economic disruption. 

&gt;Also, libya has basically no functioning government still 11 years later. After our brief civil war, we had a proper stable government that has stayed stable ever since. 

That's because unlike Ireland before it was independent, Libya has no historic precedent of practicing Parliamentary democratic procedures, so to expect them to immediately function as a democratic state is ludicrious, but the removal of Gaddafi was a good thing, despite the cost, because it now enables the functioning of accountable government to take root, because no one organisation can dominate Libya like it did before. 

&gt;Finally, we did all of that of our own volition, and with a generally United goal of getting as much independence from Britain as possible.

No you didn't, [the Germans supplied arms to Irish nationalists](https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/easterrising/insurrection/in02.shtml) in order to distract the British. 

&gt;There were disagreements over taking the treaty or not, but we weren't diametrically opposed groups that would never work well together. 

There's a 1/5th of Irish territory which is still diametrically opposed to the ROI and whom only have worked with the Irish government recently. 

&gt;For reference, Ireland began construction on a huge Hydroelectric dam in 1925 to electrify the country, just 2 years after the civil war. We didn't fall apart like libya has.

Obviously there are more valuable jobs with greater responsibility. And those should be rewarded accordingly. But obviously it shouldn’t be that person in question who should decide who gets how much.

&gt;	Wallachia is only one part of present day Romania.

No, it’s not. “Wallachia” is an exonym. The Romanians themselves called it “Țara Românească”, which is one of several reasons they chose the name “România” for the greater country. This is also why there is no administrative division of Romania called “Wallachia.”

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi%E2%80%93Soviet_economic_relations_(1934%E2%80%931941)

&gt; One week after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the partition of Poland commenced with the German invasion of western Poland. The British Ministry of Economic Warfare immediately began an economic blockade of Germany.

[..]

&gt; In the face of a British blockade, the only remaining state capable of supplying Germany with the oil, rubber, manganese, grains, fats and platinum it needed was the Soviet Union.

[..]

&gt; On February 11, 1940, Germany and the Soviet Union entered into the German-Soviet Commercial Agreement, an intricate trade pact in which the Soviet Union would send Germany 650 million Reichmarks in raw materials in exchange for 650 million Reichmarks in machinery, manufactured goods and technology. The trade pact helped Germany to surmount the British blockade of Germany.

[..]

&gt; Soviet goods were freighted to Brest-Litovsk,[127] through occupied Polish territories and then shifted to European gauge track to Germany to circumvent the British naval blockade.[95] The Soviets also granted Germany the right to transit for German traffic to and from Romania, Iran, Afghanistan and other countries in the east, while reducing by 50 per cent freight rates to Manchukuo, which was under Japanese control.


But sure they were good at murdering Poles, wait, wrong, ""fighting Poland"".

There was a very legitimate fear of a Bolshevik coup and the telegram lines, the main method of communication, were under Bolshevik control (the Bolsheviks had disproportionate support among soldiers).

888,"Scandinavian countries like your own have shown that whenever all opportunities are given equally women choose work in caregiving professions even more than anywhere else. It's not just a social construct. Men and women aren't just different physically, they're different mentally. 

Before society can even force anything on them boys will fight things out physically and make up afterwards while girls will release all pent up irritation in a big fight of words and tend to not make up afterwards. 

Girls do better in school in part because boys can't sit still as much, some say the rise in ADHD diagnoses is partly due to boys not being able to spend their energy outdoors and being annoying in class. That's not because we taught them differently. And you can stimulate women to go into STEM all you want, but the majority of degrees women tend to go for are outside of STEM, maybe it's just as simple as they don't care for those subjects as much.

Also women are more often high in agreeableness and thus as I pointed out earlier are worse at negotiating contracts and raises. In this capitalist world a business wants the cheapest labor. If the worker agrees to the terms that's their prerogative. Men overestimate but also overwork themselves so it sort of works out. Agreeable people, in this case women in general, tend to think by working hard people will magically see that and adjust their reward system automatically. But we all know that people pleasing never leads to extra respect, in fact it leads to people expecting you to keep pleasing and when you don't they get annoyed. 

As Peterson puts it: you have to show people you can be cruel but that you choose to be nice instead of just being nice and a pushover. I myself also have to work at this consciously because I am also very high in agreeableness. I had to become assertive towards my friends, family and superiors.

It's not a gender norm to pay anyone less. It's a personality trait more represented in one gender that makes them less savvy at (re)negotiating terms and expecting instead of demanding others to see their true value. 

If I agree to so something for a certain reward and then find out others get a greater reward that's my fault for playing the capitalist game incorrectly and their win for playing it correctly.

I can only assume that the police went after a vocal minority that ***did*** send death threats with their messages, and while doing so they came across other messages which insulted the President in other way.

986,"&gt;Why would you seek to discriminate between classes of citizen. Making the distinction is always potentially threatening, that's why, for example, census questions have changed over time.

But you're not discrimination, you're making a distinction of different ethnicities of people, potential doesn't equal that it *will* happen and in law there's always the potential for abuse, doesn't mean it's guaranteed to happen if there are legal safeguards.  

&gt;So taxation without representation. 

There are Scottish MPs and MSPs, if anything, they have more represenation than less. 

&gt;The problem is that now most Scottish people believe that they are a country which makes a 'unitary state' unsustainable, at least in its current form.

It's not just Scottish people thinking that, the UK need to be a federation, not balkanised. 

&gt;The Israelis discriminate against Arabs in Israel by claiming they have a different nationality. Israel doesn't recognise the existence of Palestine, for Arabs within or without Israel. That's what tiered citizenship based on ethnicity end in.

Israel recognises Arabs in Israel *proper* they have legal represenation and rights accorded to them just like their Jewish counterparts, the line is drawn against Palestinians, which is why, again, having to repeat myself here, I made the distinction between **Israeli Arabs** and Arab Palestinians. 

&gt;I suppose the Russians secretly egged Britain on. Do you have any statements from a country supporting Brexit? I am not aware of any..

Why do they have to be countries? Why not organisations? 

&gt;Jersey said ""We are expecting a peaceful demonstration by the French fishermen"" and ""we are aware that the UK are sending two offshore patrol vessels"". They didn't ask for them but they couldn't stop them because the UK has a right to send them.

[Yes, that doesn't mean they didn't appreciate the RN coming to Jersey.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-57003069) 

""As I've said, it's important that we respond to threats, but the answer to this solution is to continue to talk and diplomacy.""

I guess comments like this don't bother you;

Reacting to the French maritime minister's threat to cut off Jersey's electricity in retaliation - the fishermen were pleased.

""It's good to know our country is on our side,"" they said

&gt;They care about the fish. The electricity threat was before the gunboats were sent.

And we care about defending the territorial interests of Jersey, yet again just dismissing the French threats.  

&gt;It's the definition of Gunboat Diplomacy - resolving diplomatic issues with a Gunboat. The point is that you don't have to use the Gunboat.

It's not Gunboat diplomacy to defend the territorial integrity of your Crown dependancies waters. 

&gt;No, the Spanish haven't tried to invade Jersey, at least since the EU came into being. 

Disingenious, I wasn't talking about Jersey in that case, I was talking about Gibraltar which has had numerous territorial infringements isn't Gunboat diplomacy to defend against that type of action. 

&gt;Was there supposed to be a link? The Spanish have just as much right as Britain to throw their Gunboats about, doesn't make it clever though.

Ah, so for Spanish it's okay to piss about in Gibraltan waters, but the Brits reinforcing the ability for Jersey to defend its waters against the French isn't. 

&gt;There is a category difference between a Gunboat and a fishing boat, I leave that as an exercise for the careful reader.

No there's a category difference between the state of France and the island of Jersey being able to properly defend its waters from French fishermen without backup from the UK mainland.",British Isles,/r/europe/comments/n4i38b/joseph_plunkett_married_grace_gifford_in/gxqcvzn/,DrPepperThanks,1620742859

1116,"If you want swing producing nuclear power, that is not actually that difficult to do. 

Key trick: It is much, much easier to store heat than electricity. 

So you build a reactor which is cooled by lead, sodium, or molten salts. Then you add two large tanks to the coolant loop. One right after the reactor, and one right before. 

In between these tanks you put more turbines than the heat output of the reactor can actually support. When demand for power is low, you keep all the turbines off, and all the reactor is doing is just pouring hot coolant into the first tank, storing the energy production for later - 300 tonnes of molten lead will stay hot for a very long time, losses are very low from doing this. Then when power demand is high, you run the turbines. The turbines consume the contents of tank one faster than the reactor can fill it, and pour somewhat less hot molten lead into tank two. 

There you go. Nuclear peaker plant. And the actually nuclear part of the system gets to sit and turn over at full power, with no throttling. 

The buffering capacity of this plant depends on how large the tanks are, but smoothing out daily variations is completely trivial this way",,/r/europe/comments/n96p90/germany_reached_86_renewable_95_carbonfree/gxpnt8s/,Izeinwinter,1620727933

1158,"&gt;The socialist democratic party isn't communist or red. 

Finnish Communist party is literally left-center wing of Social-Democratic party (biggest on 1917 elections), and Red Guards were literally formed them. 

But, by your words, they are disconnected from Reds and commies - why do you say so? 

&gt; The jägers were traitors of russia, but heroes of Finland 

Finnish duchy was part of russian empire, had no stateness back then - thus I'll consider them traitors.

Just like Mannerheim who gave oath to Russian Provisional Government (not Tzar) and broke it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I advise you to be more careful when calling traitors of fascists ""heroes"".

&gt;I named two *commanders*

Great - what was their order and who gave it to them?

In soviet-finnish war 1921-1922 at least 47 officers were captured (and overall amount estimated to be \~150) - and your historiography call it ""uprising"". 

You promised me 10,000 soviet troops, but showed only two commanders acting in a very different messy situation than usual.

&gt;Honestly i don't know if he received orders, what i do know is that he helped the reds.

Then whom do you associate them with? 

USSR was formed 1922, soviet=sovet=council - is just a type of democracy, How does it work for you, you just hear ethnicity and make conclusion that he is your enemy? 

&amp;#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian\_Soviet\_Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_Soviet_Republic) \- these were USSR too?

&gt; Of course there were finns fighting

Salmela was commander of a guy whom you've brought up. Not USSR.  

&gt;doesn't take away from the fact that there were soviet commanders and soldiers

Yeah, but they were there since previous regime, as it was their country. Although White fascists cut their throats and shot them in chauvinistic manner (especially in finnish north).

&gt;I chose Tampere because it was one of the first major victories. There were excecutions of red traitors. (With a trial)

That's called post civil war political murders, not trial.

&gt;You won't find statements which are ""obvious lies"".

If I do, and you won't find any convincing evidence to support your point - will you apologize and admit being wrong?

&gt;The Finnish artillery had been moved away from the soviet border to prevent incidents like that

Was it? 

Source of info? What distance?

Can artillery be moved on position (and Mainila was very open to finns position), shoot and then move back?

Let's say with a car?

Did Finland have cars to move cannons?

You say it was moved back (whether it's true or not I don't know yet, no evidence of that from you) - then I assume it can be moved forward aswell. 

What convinces you that didn't happen that way? Except faith in good and shiny Whites, often traitors and fascists? 

&gt;Three finnish observation posts detected their fall 800 meters into soviey territory. They were out or range of finnish artillery.

Yeah, famous reports ""I've heard sound in forest"" become ""observation audio posts"". /s

&gt;Finland didn't siege Leningrad lol

See? 

You are just brainwashed - not only northern part of first encirclement ring was finnish (including ladoga), but also finnish offensive in Karelia was a part of second encirclement ring (stopped by soviet Tihvin offensive). 

Yet your ""education"" prefers not to mention that, whitewashing fascist crimes.

Because Finland didn't care about their lives and organized conditions for them to die.

Yeah... I don't think this is accurate. As far as I know, the number of men and women that have left is about even.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;also because of wars being more damaging in the east, and man being the main combatants, more women were left to study, or be safe at home, not that women didn\`t fight, they were just less in %, and often they were medics or nurses. 

This is somewhat of a factor, but it is only the thing that pushed them to ennact it harder, the communists were already doing this before the start of WWII in the Soviet Union.

 

&gt;Communism might have played some role in starving smart men that didn\`t agree though :)

[Here is a link](https://www.valeursactuelles.com/politique/pour-un-retour-de-lhonneur-de-nos-gouvernants-20-generaux-appellent-macron-a-defendre-le-patriotisme/), and here is a translation by me, a third-language speaker:


'Mister President, 
Ladies and Gentlemen of the Goverment,
Ladies and Gentlemen of the Parliament,

The hour is grave, France is in peril, a slew of mortal dangers menace her. We who, even in retirement, stay soldiers of France, cannot, under the current circumstances, remain indifferent to the fate of our beatiful motherland.

Our three-coloured flags aren't just pieces of cloth. They symbolise the tradition la tradition of those who, through the ages, of those who, whatever their skin color or their faith, served France and gave their lives for it. On these flags, we find in letters of gold the words ""Honour and Motherland"". However, today, our honour lies in denouncing the disintegration of our motherland.

– Discrimination which, through a certain anti-racism, is displayed with a single aim: to create unease, even hatred between communities, on our soil. Today, some speak of Racialism, of Indigenisme and of decolonial theories, but through these terms it is the race war these heinois and fanatic partisans want. They scorn our country, her traditions, her culture, and want to see her dissolve by tearing down her past and history. Therefore they attack, through statues, ancient military and civilian glories by analysing centuries old words.

– Discrimination which, with Islamism and the hordes in the banlieues, entails the detachment of multiple plots of the nation to transform them into territories subject to dogmas contrary to our constitution. However, every Frenchman, whatever his beliefs or his non-beliefs, is at home everywhere in France; there cannot and must not exist a city nor district where the laws of the Republic should not apply.

– Discrimination, because hatred takes precedence over fraternity when the authorities use the police as proxy agents and scapegoats in the face of the French people demonstrating in yellow vests, expressing their despair. This, while hooded, infiltrating individuals ransack businesses and threaten the very same law enforcement agencies. However, the latter only apply the, sometimes contradictory, rules given by you, the lawmakers.

The perils mount, the violent accelerates day by day. Who would have predicted ten years ago that a professor would one day be decapitated by the gate to his college? Therefore, we, the servants of the Nation, who have who have always been ready to put our skin in the line-of-fire – as our military state demanded – cannot be passive spectators before such actions.

Also, for those leading our nation, it should be imperative to find the necessary courage to eradicate these dangers. For this, it is often sufficient to apply existing laws unweakened. Do not forget that, like us, a large majority of our fellow citizens is overwhelmed by your dabbling and your guilty silences.

As it was said by cardinal Mercier, ruler of Belgium: ""When prudenve is everywhere, courage is nowhere."" So, Ladies and Getlemen, enough procrastination, the hour is grave, the work is colossal; waste no time, and know that we are ready to support policies that will take into consideration the safety of the nation.

On the contrary, if nothing is done, the laxity will continue to spread inexorably in our society, ultimately causing an explosion and the intervention of our active comrades in a perilous mission of protecting the values of our civilisation and safeguarding our compatriots on national territory.

As we can see, there is no more time to waste, otherwise, tomorrow a civil war will put an end to this growing chaos, and the deaths, for which you will bear the responsibility, will number in the thousands.'",Finländ,/r/europe/comments/n88qyp/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20210509/gxpgabg/,llittleserie,1620720709

however, weirdly enough, this is a fringe issue, there's no real debate on it. it's not a big topic in our politics.

Furthermore, there's a [bastard branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Philippe_of_Romania) that's fighting for legitimacy but isn't nearly as well regarded, he's currently a fugitive sentenced to 3 years of prison.

We are getting this service from companies and organizations that have historically been at the core of the Internet. There is no business model behind it.

My interpretation of what he is saying is:

No one makes any money from running these servers, so if you are a non-profit organisation set up only to run these servers then continuing to do so would be too expensive / difficult / risky with the new rules in place. Therefore they will give up and large companies take over who can cover the cost with money from the rest of their business. As these companies are good at evading regulation all you have done is get rid of a couple of non-profits, only to replace them with large companies who will dodge the rules anyway.

1283,"Reality. Human nature.

People are selfish, greedy assholes that want power. 

That's why any system that relies on humans being able to share and be unselfish is guaranteed to fail, and it's called a utopia = imaginary.

You're talking about anarcho-communism.

But what you fail to understand is that it takes just one guy, JUST ONE, to not go with the system.

So there's this big guy who realizes he's bigger and stronger than anybody else and can easily take their goods and can rape their women and even kill them if they oppose. What you gonna do ? Get a group of people that can fight together against him ? Maybe train so they can face any other such threats in the future ? But if they train to fight, they can't work. They can't get their food and stuff, so a part of everyone's work will have to go to them, let's say 10%, and in exchange, they'll provide protection.

Congratulations !!!! You just created the warrior class. Again.

Now there's another big strong guy that got some power. And some other guys realize that it's profitable to join him. They offer to help, for a share of the plunder. He will need their help if he wants to plunder a village that organized a defense.

So he accepts their help. He's the leader, they are the subordinates, but if/when he dies, one of them will take over. It might happen that the 2nd in command, the guy who's supposed to take over, might even plot the death of the leader, so he can take the leader's place sooner, because the leader gets all the power, most plunder, most women.

Congratulations !!!! Now you have kings/emperors. Soon they'll decide to leave the power to their children, but that will still often result in bloody fights for succession.

An assault rifle falls under the small arms category, not the heavy weapons category.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Arms_and_Light_Weapons

&gt;""Small arms"", broadly speaking, are individual-service (i.e. for carry and operation by individual infantrymen) kinetic projectile firearms. These include: handguns (revolvers, pistols, derringers and machine pistols), muskets/rifled muskets, shotguns, rifles (assault rifles, battle rifles, carbines, designated marksman rifles, short-barreled rifles, sniper rifles, etc.), submachine guns/personal defense weapons, squad automatic weapons and light machine guns.[2]

-

&gt;In contrast, the term ""heavy weapons"" generally refers to any other weapon systems that are too cumbersome for foot transportation and hence have to rely on fixed mounting platforms installed upon wheeled frames/vehicles, vessels, aircraft or fortifications for effective operation.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/n9pagb/a_massive_brawl_broke_out_in_liège_belgium/gxp95eb/,duisThias,1620714250

1361,"At least for me, Marxist communism simply represents giving the workers more power, and the bourgeois less power. I align myself with those ideals, such as free education, public transport being controlled by the state(and therefore controlled by the proletariat), and that the state provides for those who can’t work. And for those ideals which I mentioned, I do think they can certainly be achieved, and that it’s not a fantasy. 

Do I believe that more extreme ideas such as the removal of private property exist? Most likely not in my lifetime, but I hope when humanity reaches a post scarcity world, or gets close to a post scarcity world, that people do realize that the lack of private property could actually be an achievable goal, and that it should be pursued as it’s better than the alternative which is still continuing to work under bourgeois control when everyone could be supplied with what they need.

So overall. I think some Marxist ideals can certainly be achieved. And that a Marxist communist state can be achieved(and honestly should be achieved) much, much later down the line. And again, at the end of the day Marxism and his ideals represents the proletariat simply having more power, and the bourgeois having less, which I feel is achievable in today’s society.",,/r/europe/comments/n9f7r4/romanian_anticommunist_fighter_december_1989/gxp97nn/,Reaper919,1620714304

1364,"Byzantion used to be a Greek colony at the hill of a small peninsula by the Bosphorus Straits. It never had a big influence in history, until the roman emperor Constantine found out about its great geopolitical placement between Europe and Asia in the 4th Century CE. He refounded the city with roman planning, and built the magnificent buildings of a big city, and eneded up turning it into the capital of the Roman Empire.

The city of Rome had been the capital of the Roman state for 10 Centuries by then, having centuries of irregular fast growth and powerful families stablish their influences and interests. It was too chaotic for the centre of Roman boureaucracy. This is why Constantine moved to this new city; New Rome. Eventually it’d be known as Constantinople (in Greek *Konstantinoupolis* - The city of Constantine).

The Senate moved into the city (eventually Rome and Constantnople would each have a Senate) and the newly created Christian Religious structure was centred into the city. A selection of the best members of each guild would be moved to the city and the best architects would be called to build the new Forum, Basilicae, Thermae, Acueducts, Water Cisterns, Palaces and Churches. A Great Circus was built to replace previous public festivities, since it was the only Roman tradition accepted by Christians (Anphitheatres were violent and Theatres had pagan based traditions).

During Constantine’s reign a small wall was built around the tip of the Constantinople’s peninsula, mostly for administrative porpuses (Constantine’s Wall), but the city grew fast because of the centrality brought from Rome. By the times of emperor Theodosius a new wall had to be built to enclosure the periferic settlemets around Constantinople from Barbarian incursions. The walls were finished a few weeks Attila approached the city, making him go back and go for the Western Roman Empire instead, provoking the fall of Rome in the West. Following emperors improved the Theodosian walls, making the Constantinian walls obsolete, banishing inside the city.

Emperor Justinian in the 6th Century made the Circus much bigger (Hippodrome) and built the magnificent Hagia Sophia basilica (St Sophia). He also reconqudred several western provinces of the fallen Western Roman Empire, claiming many reliques and bringing them to Constantinople, enriching the monuments and churches.",,/r/europe/comments/n9p6fa/on_this_day_in_330_the_city_of_constantinople_is/gxp9ajx/,samsungrock,1620714373

Actually at the start of the Winter War in late 1939, it was the Soviets that had an agreement with the Nazis: Molotov-Ribbentrop-pact, in which they divided Europe to their spheres of influence, and Finland was ""given"" to the Soviet Union in this pact, unbeknownst to Finland.

1442,"The Swedish government *didn't* refuse to help. Repeating this despite being disproven several times won't make you any less wrong. That's not how that works

Sweden always supported Finland even if it was passive support, because they also *were* staying neutral, and directly going to war against the Soviet Union would compromise that. So they supported Finland in every way they could without drawing the wrath of Stalin

Everything in your comment is wrong, and you haven't provided any evidence whatsoever. But I will provide evidence even though you refuse to

Nazi Germany didn't help in the slightest. They were the ones who threw Finland under the bus in the first place with the Molotov Ribbentrop pact. 

Allying with the Nazis also didn't keep Finland independent either. The winter war happened over a year prior to any Finnish-German alliance. The winter war was already a failure for the Soviet Union to conquer Finland, where Finland and Swedish citizens held off the Soviets. Nazi Germany not only didn't help Finland but also, as mentioned earlier, gave Stalin the green light to invade in the first place. 

So it's already evident that the alliance with the Nazis was not out of any desire to stay independent but instead to reattack the Soviets. Siding with Germany *might* have been okay if all Finland wanted to do was retake Vyborg, but that's not what happened. 

What actually happened was Finnish leaders took the opportunity to act on their nationalist visions to conquer the Leningrad oblast, Karelia, and the Murmansk oblast, none of which were ever a part of Finland. During the war, the Finnish military operated in tight collaboration with the Nazis to take Eastern Karelia, where they operated concentration camps and participated in the same ethnic cleansing of Russians that the Nazis did during Barbarossa.

The Finnish military also participated in the siege of Leningrad, carrying out the blockade meant to starve out the city. They also participated in the siege of Murmask (also never a part of Finland) which was also a failure. 

What's interesting is that in the middle of Barbarossa, Stalin and Churchill tried to sue for peace with Finland and give territorial concessions, the land which Finland lost in the Winter War, in order to get Finland out of the war. Finnish leaders rejected it however because they thought they could take more from the Soviets, as Germany was still advancing into Russia, yet again proving that it was not in any way about defense for Finland but instead about nationalist territorial ambitions. 

With all this said, it is flat out wrong to say allying with the Axis was about ""defense."" The evidence overwhelmingly proves the opposite. 

Because of this, Finland is no longer a victim in the war but instead an active aggressor in the war as well as an enabler of the Holocaust in the east.

You can dispute that all you want, but the evidence will always prove you wrong. In fact because of this evidence, the public opinion inside Finland of Finland's role in the war is shifting to a more accurate view, namely that Finnish leaders were more than happy to assist the Nazis in carrying out Lebensraum and by extension enabling genocide in Russia.",,/r/europe/comments/n8zw7q/moloch_of_war_1966_photo_of_a_soviet_war_veteran/gxp0cf7/,TheSpaceBetweenUs__,1620707563

But in a matter of a few decades it industrialized and turned into a world power something that western powers needed hundreds of years to accomplish.

It's also worth considering that Finland, as a member of the Anti-Comintern Pact, and having banned communist parties (but oddly, not fascist parties) was in no sane rationale considered ""neutral"".  


There was an attempt to negotiate the transfer of a smaller swath of territory, but Finland refused, and the Winter War took place. Finland, after allying itself to Germany and engaging in the Continuation War was offered the cessation of territories in exchange for a peace treaty, but refused (this is why Britain declared war on Finland).   


In 1944 Ryti gave his personal assurances to Hitler that Finland would under no circumstances pursue peace with the Soviet Union. Twice, Finland refused the peaceful option, and even vowed to forgo any peaceful option.  


The justification is there, your not liking it doesn't change that, nor does taking the Winter War out of the context of the greater theatre of the Eastern Front and World War 2. Finland being smaller than the USSR doesn't change that either, nor do the systems of government.

The Finnish artillery had been moved away from the soviet border to prevent incidents like that. Three finnish observation posts detected their fall 800 meters into soviey territory. They were out or range of finnish artillery. Materials in the private archives of Soviet party leader Andrei Zhdanov show that the incident was orchestrated to paint Finland as an aggressor and launch an offensive.

I know Mannerheim crossed the old borders in the north. In the south near Leningrad however, they only took defensive positions. Finland didn't siege Leningrad lol, by that logic they old borders should have starved Leningrad. It was all done by the Germans.

The camps were intended to hold camp detainees for future exchange with the Finnic population from the rest of Russia. I know mortality rate of civilians in the camps was high due to famine and disease

I didn't find anything about Honkanen burning a red cross hospital so that's most likely just old soviet propaganda.

1577,"Part of the reason it was like that was because capitalist countries were offering free citizenship and extra aid (to ease their transition) to any ""defector"" and every country that followed the Soviet Union / Leninist model were starting from being *far* poorer countries than the top western capitalist countries they were always compared with. It's still true today that many people from poorer countries would like to move to richer ones, the main deterrent is not being able to get a visa to do so and it being hard to make the transition and stay. Even wealthy capitalist country to another (outside the EU) is tough. Fewer from rich countries want to move to much poorer ones except for retirement, and that's usually to those with the best climate, beaches, etc. 

But that being strict about migration thing started under Stalin who was a control freak and the Leninist countries that followed the Soviet Union did while and after Stalin was in power, they heavily copied that model and the Soviet Union backed the rebel groups that were most aligned with it ideologically (Leninist rooted). 

One exception at the time was Yugoslavia, which was Leninist but was much more open to western capitalist countries than the countries following the Stalinist model of the Soviet Union. They allowed much more free movement, for their citizens to travel, and for tourists to visit. 

By the 80s, China and Vietnam were tired of that tight control model and they started opening up and they are still countries which citizens can travel and move to other countries and vice versa.

1582,"The people that lived during the USSR consistently have preferred it to the modern capitalist regime. Polling regularly shows this.

&gt;Ever since the fall of the Soviet Union and the Socialist Bloc, annual polling by the has shown that over 50 percent of Russia's population lamented its collapse, with the only exception to this being in the year 2012 when support for the Soviet Union dipped below 50 percent. A 2018 poll showed that 66% of Russians regretted the fall of the Soviet Union, setting a 15-year record, and the majority of these regretting opinions came from people older than 55.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia_for_the_Soviet_Union#

Those who lived during the USSR strongly favour it, 78% of those 35+ (in 2015) agreed with the statement ""The breakup of the soviet union was a bad thing for the country"". In every polled post soviet country the people that lived during it were more likely to say the dissolution of the USSR was a bad thing. My anecdotal experience reflects this too, anyone I've met from the region that lived during that time has expressed regret for the dissolution.

How about scientific [studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544219304967?via%3Dihub) that sketch pathways towards 100% renewable economies [like this recent one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544221007167?via%3Dihub):

&gt;This research highlights the [technical feasibility](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/technical-feasibility) and economic viability of 100% renewable energy systems including the power, heat, transport and [desalination](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/desalination)  sectors. It presents a technology-rich, multi-sectoral, multi-regional  and cost-optimal global energy transition pathway for 145 regional  energy systems sectionalised into nine major regions of the world. This  1.5 °C target compatible scenario with rapid direct and indirect  electrification via Power-to-X processes and massive defossilisation  indicates substantial benefits: 50% energy savings, universal access to  fresh water and low-cost energy supply. It also provides an energy  transition pathway that could lead from the current fossil-based system  to an affordable, efficient, sustainable and secure energy future for  the world.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I also think that is not a policy that can be successfully exported to other regions of the world.

Which policy? 100% renewable energy? Renewables are already [helping poorer communities to prosper](https://energycentral.com/c/ec/how-communities-living-poverty-can-benefit-renewable-energy). They offer a fairly natural pathway of incremental improvements in regions with little to no prior infrastructure.

1670,"&gt;Its not really science its more future telling with set up models and numbers.

You are aware, that science works by building models and using these to make predictions about the future? We have a model about how gravity works, and can use that to make predictions about bodies that are influenced by it. We have models about the climate and can use that to make predictions about how it will behave in the future.

If you have data that contradicts the assumptions of a model, that is fine to point out, but just personal incredulity doesn't invalidate the models.

&gt;I would much prefer some insiders from energy companies about long-term  viability or storage and P2gas and possible developments in that fields and speed of it in the next 10, 20 years.

If you understand german you could have a look at the [plans of the german grid](https://www.netzentwicklungsplan.de/sites/default/files/paragraphs-files/NEP_2035_V2021_2_Entwurf_Zahlen-Daten-Fakten_0.pdf) operators. They look into three different scenarios considering the political goals until 2035/2040. They are responsible for [the grid stability](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/germanys-electricity-grid-stable-amid-energy-transition), so I think we can expect them to be rather conservative in their expectations.

1763,"&gt;That was the argument for the first independence referendum, I thought the official SNP line on Indyref2 was whilst indyref1 was a once in a generation vote leaving the EU classed as a significant change that would facilitate indyref2. The argument of being taken out if the EU, is a reflection of this hypothetical situation.

Brexit is one of the main justifications for the second referendum, not exactly why they want it though, otherwise there wouldn't have been a first one. But anyway, again, this is the same thing as in my previous post, just replace the words ""following the decisions of a government they didn't elect"" with ""being dragged from a union they want to be in"". It's only a reason for a referendum and it's the question of having it is where the argument regarding democracy begins. No one in the Scottish Borders asked for one for SNP to hypocritically deny.

&gt; I'm not sure why you'd think that from what I've said? What out of what I have said makes you feel I've spoke about the borders as if they are separate, I'm merely point out that their vote along with the isles does not reflect the rest of Scotland. 

When you said that after they would be leaving something they want to be a part of and join something they don't want to be a part of. They wouldn't be joining anything. They are already a part of this entity. Hence the way you phrased it was wrong and my reply that they already are a part of Scotland was meant to reflect that.

&gt; So you have said, but why do you see this as the *only* way? You don't believe they could be part of both, a best of both worlds situation. 

They would be a part of two sovereign states at the same time? No, I don't think that's realistic. Not going to go deeper into why, it's already late, but that's just what I believe.

&gt; It's all assumption (both what you and I have said) as it's hypothetical. You asked me to clarify which I did. Do you not see an independent Scotland continuing with a similar system of elected representatives along constituency lines, if so the original point stands, if not, what do you see as Scotland's parliamentary future? 

I don't think it's going to change. And by the way, Scottish parliamentary system is a mixed one, it elects both by constituency and by a popular vote. This is why SNP doesn't have an absolute majority despite winning almost every single constituency. But anyway, I am not sure what point were you even making with this.

&gt; Apologies I though I had read this in your earlier post prior to the section about the SNP history, unless it has been edited I must have misread your comment. It seems odd as we're actually in agreement on this, if they wished to leave they should be able to, and if the SNP tried to stop this it would be hypocritical. 

Well, from what I understand out disagreement comes from the fact that you believe the current elections where pro-unionist parties have won in some constituencies gives enough ground for these constituencies to remain in UK. I categorically reject this. But I think it's absolutely fair for these regions to start a separate political campaign about leaving Scotland and leave it if such a referendum is won.

&gt; Again its hypothetical based on the election results, as I've said a few times its unlikely anyone will be asking for anything unless indyref2 and independence becomes and actuality. As I say its hypothetical and in the distant future. 

Sure. My problem was really with you accusing SNP with hypocrisy now when there are yet no grounds for this.",,/r/europe/comments/n8epm5/uk_scotland_election/gxnupru/,dancedor,1620685290

1802,"&gt; London was hit pretty hard, there are numerous supply issue and countless companies loosing clients and money.

The amount of money which has left London has been relatively small (when you're talking about global hubs). There are areas like euro clearing which will get worse - but the problem for the UK was that it was going to happen anyway. We can't rewrite history to fit just one narrative - and what did a huge amount of damage to EU support here was an attempt to levy a financial tax (so at the time - a London tax). 

 &gt; That's not even to start talking about NI.

Completely agree that NI is a shit show. It was always going to be, though. It's not ok to leverage NI as a reason for the UK to have stayed in the EU though. 

If the UK decides not to impose stringent controls on those goods, then it's fair for the EU to do so if they think a massive black market will appear (personally, unlikely). BUT, it's hypocritical to label one thing as necessary for one side to maintain the integrity of  their markets, and decry the same argument for the other side. I don't have a solution. But it will need to involve compromises from both sides. If either side claims a monopoly on virtue, it will fail.

&gt;Throughout the past 3000 years, there were still pronounced ancestry shifts across time periods driven by genetic contributions from the Near East in the Imperial period, and later from Europe, mirroring changes in the political affiliations of Rome. Furthermore, within each time period, individuals exhibited highly diverse ancestries, including those from the Near East, Europe, and North Africa. These high levels of ancestry diversity began prior to the founding of Rome and continued through the rise and fall of the empire, demonstrating Rome’s position as a genetic crossroads of peoples from Europe and the Mediterranean.

Boys are bad at sitting still, have a higher need to move about, are less organized and tend to break the rules more often.

This does not mean that boys are less clever or smart, but that school offers an environment that is better for girls. We can see this in grades as well. Statistically boys get consistently worse grades in elementary school.

1914,"&gt;Now you're just being silly. Nazi has an actual meaning too.

How do you define nazi and how do they differ from fascists? 

&gt;You argued that Finland was fascist (and now apparently Nazi) 

If you are in alliance with nazis on war, if your militaries call each other ""waffenbruderschaft"" (brothers in arms), if your policies on occupied territories and to other nations match each other, if even your propaganda copies theirs - then yes, I guess I can call it that way.

&gt;neither was Finland controlled by some other fascist group

Strange, but when Hitler asks to make offensive to Svir - Finland does so, how's that? :)

&gt;For a state to be fascist, you kinda need something to actually make it a fascist state.

Do you say that sincerely?

I'm just curious what do you study in school, rainbow studies?

&gt;Soviet Union was allied 

No, it wasn't and I wrote you that, but for some reason you've ignored that.

Please, deliver me document about ALLIANCE between these two. 

And when you don't find them search for some quotes of head of Germany of those years about policies to countries to the east.

&gt;I guess Finland was on the antifascist side then

[I guess Goebbels would be proud of you.](https://youtu.be/lLdrozndLs0?t=117)

&gt;just divided Europe

No, they didn't. 

&gt;assisted each other

Again wrong. They tolerated each other, but not assisted. 

Do you think that's absolutely wrong and that's a sign of being nazi ally?

&gt;invaded Poland together

USSR didn't touch Poland before Polish government left country. 

Was USSR in Poland 1st of September? No. 7th? 10th? 14th? No.

By the way, not Poland, but Western Ukraine and Belarus, which Poland occupied in 1920s.

&gt;But Finland is fascist and Nazi because...

...Finnish government decided to take this course and become nazi ally.

&gt;Makes sense.

I'm glad it is. Only you raised in a pseudopatriotic way argue that.

&gt;Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were absolutely allies

No common operations, just as I've said, but you again choose to ignore arguments that prove you wrong.

&gt;even if there wasn't a formal agreement specifically calling them allies

You've said to me:

&gt; Nazi has an actual meaning too. I don't know why you don't even bother to study these things before talking. 

Can you, please, answer me - what was fascist and nazi position towards communists? Their attitude and their actions?

&gt;Soviet logic

Soviet logic was to save itself from fascist wars. Finnish logic was to catch opportunity in that.

Simple as that.

&gt;Does anyone actually still believe in this bullshit? 

I donno, some finns believe that finnish government who had perfect chances to make good deal for Finland with USSR instead chose war, atrocities, territory losses and later pushed country on nazi side - they are good and reasonable people, but those who don't support them - are no less than ""traitors"".

Maybe vice versa? Or you still believe this bullshit?

&gt;Next you're going to tell me that Finland started Winter War

1945,"Kids need attachment figures that reflect what the kid is surrounded by and - best case - will be surrounded by as a grown up. It's beneficial to have people of both genders, because people who identify as male and female make up the majority of society. Gay parents face this unique challenge, but attachment figures vome in many different shapes and sizes. Teachers can be attachment figures, relatives as well. They can fill the void. But it IS a void, because of the makeup of society.  
Now, two loving, intelligent gay parents who are aware of what kind of world we live in can certainly do much to fill in any gaps. It can very well work out. Some kids are quite robust and what kids need first and foremost - unconditional love to build their baisc sense of trust - can be given by pretty much any kind of person. There isn't necessarily damage coming from any unusual parenting arrangment. It's always a case by case question.  
If we're talking basics, two caring, loving parents are better than one, one is better than none and anything is better than uncaring, unloving people. Male and female role models are better than just one of the kinds. Additional role models for non-binary self-identification, other sexual orientations and whatnot are better than not to get in touch with those important realities of modern life. I'm not trying to exclude anyone here and I'm not trying to kick into any direction. I'm just looking at it from the perspective of what the child benefits the most from and what it needs. Which is sometimes not compatible with ideology, identity politics or all the other things of importance to adults.  
We - the adults - not only shape the society the child will have to become a functioning and adjusted grown up in to prosper, we also have to teach them about all of this. We can prepare them or let them stumble into it blindly. Sometimes, the latter is prefarable in case of deeply bigotted parents, but that's already a less than optimal situation. I'm sure you get it.  
In a perfect world, a kid would have one of 'each' to grow up and be attached to, but that's hardly realistic. So I gotta coldly and logically prioritize. Which leads to my statement. I hope you aren't going to be offended by this, as it's not meant to offend.

Well adjusted children can come from true horror shows of childhood homes. And completely maladjusted ones from objectively almost perfect homes. Kids are individuals from the day they're born.

Since the beginning? Few months? 

De facto success of german troops were bigger then all of the white successes before.

&gt; It was already over for the reds. 

I guess germans were invited not for cheerleading.

&gt; but there were 7000-10 000 soviet soldiers in Finland aiding the reds. 

Were there?

Who send them there? What was their unit? Who was commander?

47 finnish officers ended up as POW (most managed to escape). That's not aid - that's war.

Then why facts don't support your words? Events, stenogrammes, photos, maps, documents?

Polish government in London exile ordered to begin the uprising without bothering to ask the Soviet command whether they are in a position to aid it. David Glantz in his book ""When titans clashed"" makes the case that there had been legitimate reasons for the  Soviet Army's failure to help the uprising. It took the Soviet troops three more months to break out of bridgeheads across Vistula and begin tge offensive to capture Warsaw. Of course, nationalist right-wing Polish propaganda simply discounts all those reasons.

My theory isn't that women are afraid of STEM fields cause they're male dominated so much as they've been conditioned to like, prefer and be interested in other fields that are woman dominated instead. Like my mother, my 2 aunts and my grandmother has all been nurses, very likely due to the fact that that's traditionally been a womens field. They all grew up taking ""housewife"" classes in school and ended up studying nursing cause that's what was socially promoted for women. 

However the times are changing, and I think the main reason that's really holding back women from getting into mens dominated fields these days isn't fear so much as it is the idea that some fields are fit better for women while others are better fit for men. Women care way less now about what's a woman's field and what's a mans field. 

Like a cousin of mine, she's a professional climber, another cousin, she's a programmer, a 3rd cousin, she's a physical therapist. Their grandma, mother and aunt were all nurses, but now none of them are cause now it's become socially accepted and even promoted that you pursue the field or work you like regardless of these gender norms.

Other than that, I'm not going to comment on the implications on my feelings/opinions towards NATO, other than what I previously said about some of their current pivotal members being just as omitting of their own atrocities in the past (as they so gladly blame Russia for... but that would be resorting to ""whataboutism""?)... and it is THAT hypocrisy that I wanted to emphasize here. I'm fully aware that NATO has also offered millions of people a free life and peace, and are based on meritorious principles.. but... I just can't stand the hypocrisy and sanctimony...

Also, most of my press/news sources are western sources.. and I rarely/barely check any Russian ones, because I know they're (even more shit and propagandist) than our western media, save perhaps a few ""liberal"" eastern european newsdesks..

Having been to Russia a handful of times over the past couple of years, I've been extremely pleasantly surprised by the ""charm"", still trying to look at it as objectively as possible, but the general ""young/new"" generations there, are quite similar to the people here (in western europe) nowadays... consumerism, capitalism, and western-pop-culture has reached Russia too..

2034,"&gt; My original point stands, European countries as a whole care about human rights. I'm not denying past actions, nor am I justifying them. But there is nothing wrong nor hypocritical about pointing out the modern wrongdoings of countries with medieval laws that oppress their own people.


Lmao this not “past actions”.  you say that while they arm Saudi with weapons to commit genocide. You say that while European companies are engaged in slavery and exploitation of workers through out the world directly or indirectly . You say that while literal racist fascist are in govs throughout Europe. You say that as refugees are drowning in the MED while many Europeans cheer for that including in this sub. You say that while Germany continues to make massive business deals with Russia despite their crimes. You say while Europeans are prideful of their colonial history and won’t try war criminals like Tony Blair. I can go on. Europe like the US only cares about money first and foremost not human rights pretending otherwise is ignorant. It’s only when money coincides  with human rights issues than all of a sudden European nations care about human rights.

Also you’re completely wrong about France imperialism in Libya and through out Africa. France is hated in most Africa and is seen as neo imperialist nation ubiquitously.

2104,"This is very bad history and is post-Stalin and Soviet  semi propoganda in attempt to downplay the original problems that where in russia at that time and to make it look as bad as possible (not saying it was all sunshine and flowers)

Lenin did no create gulags in russia as forced labour camps existed before him and he envisioned them as ""had a distinctly political purpose for    socially dangerous, disruptive, suspicious, and other disloyal elements, whose deeds and thoughts were not contributing to the strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat"" (this one is from wiki). They only gained there really horrible status in the 1930's with mass deportations and incarcerations which was not the original purpose as a way to strike fear into the populace and to create a constant fear and paranoia for blind obedience.

Have you ever thought why the USSR's leaders oficial title was General Secretary? As it is not common for a secretary to be the chairmen of a party and a  leader of a counrty. It was the job that was given to Stalin after his role as a uneducated  thug, robber and extortionist was over and no longer needed. Originally it was a desk job to only give information for higher positions of meeting times and locations  and apointing job roles to others. He used this position to stack jobs with his loyals and slowly push out others out of high offices like Trosky who he just did not inform of important meetings and so on. Even gave him the wrong date for Lenins funeral so that he could show how caring of a leader he was to the masses and make Trosky look like a fool for not showing up.

As Russia had it first real time with a different regime ( the Aleksandr Kerensky Duma regime does not count as it was very short and pleagued with problems from the start) they just were not that experienced with creating a goverment and let such big loop holes in it for a secretary to become a leader of a party and  a nation.

If you would know something more about Lenin (other than he was just a communist) you would know that he fully belived in communism and wanted the best for the proletariat working tirelessly and living modestly. He most likely ( is debated)  wanted for Trosky to become the countries leader  not Stalin  as clearly seen by what offices they held  a secretary and a leader of navy and military.  you saying that "" The sources we have for Lenin being secretly opposed to Stalin are dubious. "" is complete bollocks just google Lenins testament.

I am not for glorifying Lenin as a good leader and  god or something (he did plenty of bad thing as well). I am just saying that he should not be demonised or held responsible for what Stalin made USSR into. And be made an example of  what happens when the proletariat are ignored and flock around radical left.",,/r/europe/comments/n8k71l/lenins_statue_in_poland/gxlyhq8/,TRAGIC_cancer,1620655897

Your source says the opposite.

Besides, it is not even the main point. Even if Palestinians Arabs were genetically identical to Palestinian Jews (which they are not), Palestinian Arabs are Arabs *by their own definition*. They speak Arabic, joined the Arab League, and more importantly are politically aligned with the other Arabic peoples, and have pretty much the same regard for human rights as their neighbours in Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq. 

It is the right of Palestinian Arabs and Arabs in general to complain about human rights violations against them, but they should first of all take a good, hard look at *their* violations of human rights, such as the rights of gays, women, religious minorities, and the right to renounce Islam without being sent to jail or put to death.

The Irish who joined the British army were Irish citizens, not British, Ireland was already a free state by this point in time, before then becoming a Republic in 1948.

&gt; Bulgaria

Hah, Bulgarian despised Russia to the point they sided with the Germans in BOTH world wars... take a hit will you? 

""Relations between two started to worsen in 1884 when Russia refused to diplomatically support [Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Bulgaria) in the [Bulgarian unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_unification) and the following [Serbo-Bulgarian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbo-Bulgarian_War).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria%E2%80%93Russia_relations#cite_note-2) This had a serious impact on Bulgarian–Russian relations, which continues to even modern day.

Bulgaria and Russia's relations continued to fall as Bulgaria accused Russia of meddling into its internal affairs, a fact that contributed to growing alliance between Tsarist Russia and [Serbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Serbia). This led to antagonism between Bulgaria and Russia even when Russia motivated Bulgaria to form an alliance with Montenegro, Serbia and Greece to drive the Austrians away. When Bulgaria got a chance to occupy [Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople) during the [First Balkan War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Balkan_War) against the Ottomans, Russia opposed Bulgarian military actions.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria%E2%80%93Russia_relations#cite_note-Stowell1-3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria%E2%80%93Russia_relations#cite_note-4) Russia also refused to condemn Serbia and Greece for attacking Bulgaria in the [consequent war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Balkan_War). But Tensions between Bulgaria and Russia eventually erupted in the [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) when Bulgaria sided with [German Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire) over the promise to regain its lost soil. Eventually, Bulgaria and Russia suffered heavy military losses for their wars, and Bulgarian–Russian relations severed. It was not until 1930s that saw Russia, as Soviet Union, established relations with Bulgaria.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria%E2%80%93Russia_relations#cite_note-5)

2520,"&gt; Romania 

Pretty big lie; Russians were despised in Romania for their invasions and occupation of the country. 

 ""In 1806, forces of [Tsar Alexander I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Russia) reoccupied the principalities, and the local peasants were subjected to forced requisitions, heavy labor obligations, and real threats of exile to Siberia. As a result, the Romanians, who once had looked to the tsar for liberation, developed an abiding mistrust of the Russians that would deepen in the next century. In 1812, Russia and the Porte signed the [Peace of Bucharest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Bucharest_(1812)), which returned the principalities to the Ottomans and secured Russia's southern flank during Napoleon's invasion; Russia, however, annexed Bessarabia and retained its right to interfere in the principalities' affairs. 

Russia's actions caused a multiplication of anti-Russian sentiment throughout the Principalities, for each group having a different reason. The urban elite (the later Liberals) were frustrated by Russia's opposition to reform in Romania; while landowning boyars (the later Conservatives) were frustrated by Russia's impediments on the economy.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania%E2%80%93Russia_relations#cite_note-GlennyEarlyRomania-3) Romania was flooded with French literary works transmitting Enlightenment ideas, and due to the similarity of Romanian and French, these had a much faster effect on Romania than other areas.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania%E2%80%93Russia_relations#cite_note-GlennyEarlyRomania-3) Hence, from a very early time, there was competition between France and Russia for Romania's affinities, even though Russia was the only one of the two to have any real immediate significance to Romania. These feelings provided only strengthened the [anti-Russian sentiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russophobia#Romania) in Romania.

In 1848, Romanians for the first time revolted against Russia, and the Russian flag and the Organic Declarations were burned in public.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania%E2%80%93Russia_relations#cite_note-GlennyEarlyRomania-3) Romania in fact wooed [the Porte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottomon_Empire), which had to be ""persuaded"" by Russia not to aid the Romanians.

The uprising of Transylvania's Romanian peasants during the 1848 European revolutions ignited Romanian national movements in Walachia and Moldavia. In Moldavia, Sturdza quashed the revolution overnight by arresting its leaders. In Walachia, however, a majority of the younger generation was averse to Russian and boyar dominance. Revolutionary platforms called for universal suffrage, equal rights, unification of the two principalities, and freedom of speech, association, and assembly. Although he sympathized with the revolutionary movement, Bibescu lacked the courage to lead it. After naming a revolutionary cabinet and signing a new constitution, he fled into Transylvania. The new government of Walachia quickly affirmed its loyalty to the Porte and appealed to Austria, France, and Britain for support, hoping to avert a Russian invasion. The government also formed a committee composed equally of boyars and peasants to discuss land reform. Shocked by the revolution's success in Europe and fearful that it might spread into Russia, the tsar invaded Moldavia and pressured the Porte to crush the rebels in Bucharest. Dissatisfied with Turkey's weak resolve, Russia invaded Walachia and restored the Règlement. After 1849 the two empires suppressed the boyar assemblies in Walachia and Moldavia and limited the tenure of their princes to seven years.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania%E2%80%93Russia_relations#cite_note-Romania_-_The_Russian_Protectorate-2)

In July 1853, Russia invaded and occupied Romania.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania%E2%80%93Russia_relations#cite_note-GlennyEarlyRomania-3) Russian occupation was harsh and all political organizations were suppressed. When the Porte declared war on Russia in October of that year, Romanians hoped desperately that Russia would be driven from their country (ironically by the country which they had just recently separated from). This wish was granted by the coalition of both Turkey and Austria against Russia.

Fear of Russian encroachment in the Balkans drove the Romanians in 1883 into a secret pact with Vienna. The king, Prime Minister Ioan Bratianu, Foreign Minister D. A. Sturdza, and Romanian Minister to Vienna P. P. Carp supported Romania's orientation toward the Central Powers.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania%E2%80%93Russia_relations#cite_note-6) In addition there was economic competition with Russia. From very early on, however, Romanian economic competition with Russia throttled good relations. Romania is a natural economic rival of Russia (on the eve of World War II, in fact, it was the world's fourth largest food exporter, after Russia, Canada and the US).[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania%E2%80%93Russia_relations#cite_note-7) Balkans expert Misha Glenny explains Russia's historical attitude towards Romania as such:

&gt;*...Russia saw wheat cultivation in Romania as a threat to its own harvests in southern Russia, much of it sold on to Britain and France. If the Principalities were able to modernize the port facilities on the* [*Danube*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube) *and the* [*Black Sea*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea)*, they could begin to undercut the price of Russian wheat on world markets. To throttle this competition, Russia exploited its position as protector of the Principalities by allowing the mouth of the Danube to silt up. Russia's interest in the Principalities was essentially strategic. St. Petersburg wanted a pliant satellite, not an economic competitor.*

Russia's expansionist designs in the Balkan Peninsula with its conclusive geo-political objective the capture of the strait of [Bosphorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosphorus) and [Dardanelles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dardanelles) convinced Romania that Russia has no good faith, and forced Romania to look for support somewhere else. Russia's aggressiveness, its projects for territorial conquests was being executed under the policy of [Pan-Slavism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Slavism). Bratianu denounced the danger of the Pan-Slavic idea for the entire Europe.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania%E2%80%93Russia_relations#cite_note-8) There, on the shores of Bosphorus and Dardanelles, was the key to Europe. Romanian Prime Minister [Take Ionescu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Ionescu) concludes: “All the efforts made by the empire, all its aspirations, all the Russian impetus are heading towards that point”. The Russian conquests in this region would have threatened Romania's existence itself. “We cannot talk about agreements, compromises and concessions. If we still exist, Russia will experience a failure in its plans which have animated the heart of the Russians, for two centuries. If the neighbouring empire succeeds in accomplishing the dream it has pursued with so much confidence and tenacity, the Romanian state and people will become just a memory. This is the truth.”[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania%E2%80%93Russia_relations#cite_note-9)

Between 1885 and 1913, Romania and Russia found themselves in two systems of opposed alliances, since both had divergent interests in the Balkan area. Russia's efforts to expand its influence in the Balkans met with the Austro-Hungarian resistance. Since Russia's claims in the Balkans were sustained in most cases by France and Great Britain, and the Austro-Hungarian claims were sustained by Germany, the Balkan Peninsula was about to face the strong political pressures from both side.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania%E2%80%93Russia_relations#cite_note-10) During the Balkan crisis of 1885–1886 there were marked Russian-Romanian divergences because the Romanian diplomacy supported the election of [Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_I_of_Bulgaria) at the Bulgarian throne, the candidate backed by Austria-Hungary.",,/r/europe/comments/n8oje5/toaday_i_am/gxkwgsa/,Shmeddit23,1620627353

2527,"Man I'm just saying how I see it, I might be wrong, I mean about the whole thing. I feel like you're pretty determined to shut down the subject and wrap it up ASAP, not have to think about it -  that's fine. Maybe none of my reasons hold water, it's a possibility. But you and others mostly addressed just one, the founding myth which is dubious, I admit. I see a lot of wounded pride and urgency to shut the discussion down, not explore it. IDK... maybe it's not worth exploring. I thought it was an interesting idea, but I see how people are sensitive about it. And rest assured I have zero agenda; I'm just curious and sincerely put it out there in maybe a naive way. 


It's not my goal to piss off a lot of people, I usually agree with whatever the consensus is and don't comment because I have nothing new to contribute, nothing to add to the discussion. When I do comment it's often to present a side which is underrepresented, and this more often than not gets downovtes - it's just what happens when you're forwarding unpopular ideas. People are pretty hostile to these sort of challenges, they see them as provocations that are somehow personal and agenda driven. Or maybe I'm doing it badly, it's possible as well, but not everyone is agent saboteur here, some of us are real, actual people.

A piece of land can only belong to 1 country. Furthermore if you do chose the fictional reality where both countries exist in the same land then BOTH parties will dislike you because you do not support their claim.

So if you cannot realistically recognize both then who do you choose? Well Israel is the chose for the west. Israel is a nation that was created as a haven for the Jewish people after ages of discrimination. To not support them now would be like betraying them, that would not look well. Israel is also far more friendly towards the west then Palestine people are. 

It is also to be expected that moslim countries support Palestine. They share the same faith and are more culturally similar.  It is also important to remember that Israël is the result of Britisch colonialism. The land was given to Israel by a colonial power. This is not something the locals can appreciate.

The point of Christianity is not that you'll become a sin-free angel upon joining. When I regularly attended (Lutheran) church, it was part of the confession and forgiveness we all said together. An example that lines up with the confession as I recall it:

&gt; Pastor: If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. But if we confess our sins, God who is faithful and just will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

&gt; Pastor: Most merciful God,

&gt; Congregation: we confess that we are in bondage to sin and cannot free ourselves. We have sinned against you in thought, word, and deed, by what we have done and by what we have left undone. We have not loved you with our whole hearts; we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves. For the sake of your Son, Jesus Christ, have mercy on us. Forgive us, renew us, and lead us, so that we may delight in your will and walk in your ways, to the glory of your holy name. Amen

2617,"Sure.

Look.  I can sorta see the logic.  ""Putin tried to kill one guy, so why not more?""

But think about it for a moment.

Navalny is — particularly tenacious — political opposition.  Whether or not killing him is a good idea, he fully intends to be a thorn in Putin's side, and is not willing to play ball.

The doctors who treated Navalny were just doing their jobs.  Putin's got no beef with them.

Hell, this latest guy sounds like the hospital administrator who adopted the official ""not Novichok, just low blood sugar"" story a bit later and then shortly after got promoted to oversee the region.  He *is* playing ball, if anything.

*checks*

Yeah, this is him.

*But he knows that it wasn't low blood sugar, so maybe he was killed to cover it up!*

First, covering up an attempted murder by performing an expanding circle of murders doesn't sound like a great idea.

Second, killing people who are doing what you want is a really good way to ensure that next time around, people aren't gonna be willing to do what you want.

Now, let's look at the other side.  It sounds like the guy was riding alone, in some forest, on an ATV.  ATVs kill a lot of people — they're easy to roll, have no protection if you do roll them, and heavy enough to kill riders via crushing if they do roll.  The place was pretty remote if it was a hunting lodge so he may not have had cell coverage to call for help even if he was just seriously injured but still conscious and able to move somewhat.  Nothing about anyone else missing, so he was probably alone.

https://www.topgearbox.com/cars/car-news/why-are-atvs-so-dangerous/

&gt;* Never ride alone. Running out of fuel or crashing can be life threatening if you’re alone.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-terrain_vehicle

&gt;Safety has been a major issue with ATVs due to the high number of deaths and injuries associated with them and the negligible protection offered by the machine. 

-

&gt;In the United States, statistics released by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) show that in 2005, there were an estimated 136,700 injuries associated with ATVs treated in US hospital emergency rooms.

Now, I'm not gonna say that he absolutely wasn't killed.  But I am gonna say that I'd require more than ""guy goes missing while ATVing"" to get excited about it.  ""The Kremlin has had people killed"" shouldn't mean that the default assumption becomes state-sponsored murder.

And yeah, I know, in the case of previous murders and attempted murders, Russia ran bullshit and lied about it.  But I'm not saying ""trust the Russian government that it wasn't involved"".  I'm just saying that there are a large number of deaths in Russia every year, and the overwhelming majority of them are not the state having people murdered.  In this case, I don't think that there's even a reasonable motive, and there's no evidence other than that.

If something comes up, like a major intelligence agency says ""yeah, we have information that this was actually a state murder"", fine.  But that hasn't happened.  All we have is a missing guy who had some short-term interaction with Navalny.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/n8q7yi/two_doctors_who_treated_navalny_have_already_died/gxkmu6l/,duisThias,1620620113

2645,"&gt;When Napoleon lay at Boulogne for a year with his flat-bottomed boats and his Grand Army, he was told by someone. “There are bitter weeds in England.” There are certainly a great many more of them since the British Expeditionary Force returned.\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Turning once again, and this time more generally, to the question of invasion, I would observe that there has never been a period in all these long centuries of which we boast when an absolute guarantee against invasion, still less against serious raids, could have been given to our people. In the days of Napoleon the same wind which would have carried his transports across the Channel might have driven away the blockading fleet. There was always the chance, and it is that chance which has excited and befooled the imaginations of many Continental tyrants. Many are the tales that are told. We are assured that novel methods will be adopted, and when we see the originality of malice, the ingenuity of aggression, which our enemy displays, we may certainly prepare ourselves for every kind of novel stratagem and every kind of brutal and treacherous maneuver.\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our Island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone.   
&gt;  
&gt;At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty’s Government-every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength.   
&gt;  
&gt;Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God’s good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.

Start with Stalin and go:

* Holodomor
* invasion of Baltics, Finland, Romania
* invasion of Poland
* Katyn - deserves a point apart
* the raping of the people the Red Army ""liberated"", and maybe sending back some of the watches they stole
* invasion of Hungary in 1949
* invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968
* invasion of Afghanistan
* annexation of Crimea
* invasion of Ukraine

We felt that getting a better gender balance would make our workplaces better places to work.

Palestinians were the original inhabitants and outnumbered the Jews by a huge majority, yet the Jews demanded half of the Palestinian land for peace, taking almost all of the coastline and leaving the Palestinians with the west bank region and the desert.

The Palestinians, being Arabs took help from the other Arab countries and waged wars against Israel. Israel won those wars and took control over most of the land that was left for Palestine plus the Sinai peninsula from Egypt and the Golan heights in Syria. The Sinai peninsula was returned to Egypt, but they kept the Golan heights.

The Palestinians tried revolting many times, but the Israeli army kept killing all of them. Israel effectively created the world's biggest prison out of Gaza, a region of Palestine closed off from the west bank.

Their oppression and destructive actions in India created an independence so powerful it was impossible to fight. 

Not to mention that Britain never tried to integrate its colonies as core territory. The nations that tried to integrate its colonies lasted significantly longer. Both the Portuguese and French empires lasted longer because of this. (Not that they were good either, they were horrible as well). Plus its worth remembering the colonies were never really profitable on their own. The British colonies were only profitable because they were part of a larger entity. Once the British lost India lots of the Empire actually became unprofitable.

The statistics mostly disagree with you. 2000 to 2010 was quite possibly the least savage decade in history (going by number of people killed in conflicts), despite the very high profile US led interventions at that time. The last decade was bloodier but still better than most decades in the 2nd half of the 20th century; which of course was significantly less bloody than the first half of the 20th century.

&gt;That's not exactly right. Read the  articles closely. The pact defined spheres of influence, and agreed to  non aggression. This was after the Soviets made many attempts to form an  alliance with France and Britain against Germany, efforts that were  rejected because the west was hoping for Hitler to attack the USSR.  Hence, the Soviets decided to sign a non aggression treaty with Germany  to buy time for the inevitable war between them. Britain and France  allowed Germany to take over Czechoslovakia, but somehow most think this  was more acceptable - I wonder why?  
&gt;  
&gt;In any case, Germany invaded half of Poland, but Eastern Poland remained intact. However, the Polish government fled to Romania and resigned from its post, leaving Eastern Poland ungoverned.  So the Soviets could either leave the Germans to seize it, or move in  themselves to provide a territorial buffer. So this is what they did,  two weeks later.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is why  neither Poland nor the west declared war on the USSR but did so on  Germany. The Polish army was ordered to fight against Germany, but not  the Soviets.  
&gt;  
&gt;All of this got  twisted later in Western mythology to suggest the Soviets and the  Germans split Poland between them in that pact.

But anyway, since most enlightened europeans were told same stuff about evil USSR and evil Russia all the time (talk about propaganda, eh), I doubt that many would remain open-minded enough to even consider something remotely otherwise.",,/r/europe/comments/n8oje5/toaday_i_am/gxjzyoi/,pick_d,1620606479

However, I do believe we’re now experiencing a tunnel vision where we only focus on women’s problems, and not as much as men’s, which I find unfair. Because equality means equality.

For instance, I always have to argue with people why international men’s day is not necessary, but international women’s day is. Where’s equality in that? 

“Because women have been oppressed in the past” is always the answer. Which is so completely idiotic, because men now have not made the past, and we’re living in the present.

I think we’re losing ourselves in some sort of social justice where we’re trying to be as politically correct as possible, even if it means we’re not seeing some of the other problems.

2910,"Unpopular opinion coming in from Germany: The Rape of Berlin is hyped by anglo media because it fits the ""Russia bad"" narrative. It elevates the westerners from the lower bolsheviks and creates a narrative of western troops helping the Germans.

In reality rape and looting occurred in all allied zones in Germany as did forced labour and expulsion. Every family all over Germany can share a story. The Brits where supposedly nicer, than the other allied forces but nonetheless every female family member of mine alive at the time was raped by a brit. 

It was even sometimes expected by families that women would ""befriend"" or simply prostitute themselves with allied soldiers in order to get food or other supplies. The number of rape by western allies is likely in a similar scale. See for example this [Spiegel Article](https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/book-claims-us-soldiers-raped-190-000-german-women-post-wwii-a-1021298.html) available in English.

2917,"On the Aeneid of course it's preposterous, that's kinda the point: at this remove of time it has zero importance if it was founded by refugees or whoever - to the modern Italian it's pretty much the same.


&gt;The people that came both the Ostrogoth and Longobards were a small minority of warriors Elite, they couldn't possibly impact the entire population of Italy

It depends on how you define impact and how far you're willing to stretch the boundaries of genetic variation and still claim it's domestic - what you consider ""a shift"" and what the numbers and the impact was it's no less speculative and arbitrary than my claim so there is no point in arguing much about that. Britain has experienced invasions on the order of magnitude fewer than the Apennine and they still talk about the Norman invasion and consider it as a pivotal event in their history and it's recorded genetically, for the eugenicists among us. In some sense the various invasions in the territory of modern day Italy have had lesser effect *because* they were heterogeneous all along. I feel it's dumb to even argue these vast swaths of history compared to which Italy in it's current form is fairly recent and of little significance in historic terms - as someone with the banner next to your nickname should have no problem recognizing. 


&gt;Most of the diversity inside the Italian peninsula comes from the Empire itself as in traffic during the height of it with people coming from all over the Mediterranean


With this I agree, but you're arguing my point for me: my comment was arguing against the notion that Italians are the descendant's of Romans on ""genetic terms"". In fact there is no genetic Roman, whether Aeneas of a handful of peasants originally, and there is probably no genetic Italian consequently: even if you take the influence of invasions out of the equation, still the Romans themselves imported one way or another millions of people through slavery, trading, military, grants of citizenship rights etc. Italy was in no small part divided in latifundia, which estates were worked with slave labor from all over; the mix of military recruits from various regions of the empire were spread after the campaigns all over the peninsula and farther afield with the veteran resetlement programs colonization programs. So whatever the Italy - Roman Empire connection might theoretically be, if anything, I wouldn't reach for genetics to help me out.",,/r/europe/comments/n8dufn/ancient_romans_compared_to_presentday_italians/gxjl9ag/,mijazma,1620598376

2982,"It is indeed a long and complicated story, but the core of the current Dutch position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is that there should be a two state solution, which has to come about through peaceful negotiations. The Dutch recognition of Israel stems from 1950, for which there was widespread support across the political spectrum at the time. The main drivers for the Dutch recognition were (1) the failure to protect the majority of the Dutch Jews from the Holocaust and the guilt felt for this, (2) for the left in particular the impression that Israel was building a social-democratic utopia, (3) for the Christian parties the religious conviction that the Holy land should be Jewish, (4) for liberals in particular the fact that Israel was firmly in the Western camp during the Cold War, with strong ties to the United States and as the only democracy in the Middle East. Since then, Dutch politics has become more divided and polarised on the questions and proposed solutions surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, largely along a left-right axis. It is still one of the few issues in foreign affairs that can become highly emotionally charged very quickly, which is why it is such a difficult topic to debate.",,/r/europe/comments/n8j9aq/international_recognition_of_israel_and_palesine/gxjm8hj/,PoliticalAnimalIsOwl,1620598891

3026,"&gt;This image is pretty much an answer to questions like ""What did the Ancient Romans look like? Did they resemble modern Italians?""


Except it doesn't. 


For starters, all these people are Italians and they look nothing alike. There isn't a model Italian, of course, that is other than a moronic caricature for people who need those sorts of crutches to help them deal with the reality of flesh and blood world. This image suggests both yes and no to the question: did the roman emperors look like the Italians - obviously yes, all these (supposed) lookalikes are Italian. On the other hand, the apparent diversity suggests that there is no exemplary-looking Italian like there is no exemplary  Hungarian or Serb or Portuguese, so you could easily assemble just as credible a cast of lookalikes from the stock of passport carriers of any other European or North American nations: so no, the emperors didn't look like Italians. 


Bottom line is they looked like *people* and any attempt to herd them in some ethnic or nationalistic camp should be seen as transparently petty and embarrassing. They looked like themselves first and foremost, they deserve at least that recognition and maybe it had something to do with the cosmopolitan nature of the Roman Empire, how broad and inclusive it was, peopled with Slavs and Gauls and North Africans and how racial differences weren't thought all that much of at the time.


This shouldn't be cause for taking pride by Italians because, as I said I'm sure I could do about as well hunting for lookalikes in Kiev on a rainy Tuesday night. Secondly, the Roman Empire has little more than geographical overlap with the modern Italian Republic; in the age of Mussolini this happenstance was given great weight to, but I think in all fairness and due respect to Italy, which I love, the Roman Empire was something much bigger, cosmopolitan and of historic importance than the small euro state that was just a handful of warring fiefdoms two-80 year olds-ago. Roman Empire was located in Rome which the Italians *inherited*  the remains of, but it's history is pan-european and belongs to all the Europeans and more, just like it's emperors did.",,/r/europe/comments/n8dufn/ancient_romans_compared_to_presentday_italians/gxj6qus/,mijazma,1620591232

Yeah, looks like Nuremberg involved fighting.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nuremberg_(1945)

&gt;The Battle of Nuremberg was a five-day battle between the forces of the United States 7th Army on one side, and Nazi Germany and Russian Liberation Army volunteers on the other during World War II. The battle saw some of the fiercest urban combat during the war and it took four days for the United States to capture the city. The battle was a blow to Nazi Germany as Nuremberg was a center of the Nazi regime. The Nuremberg Rally took place in the city and to lose the city to the Americans took a heavy toll on already low German morale.[1] Even though American forces heavily outnumbered the German forces,[2] it wasn't until 20 April, that the 7th Army took the city center. The battle devastated the city. 

Based on the WP article, I think that the photo shown represented the official end to the battle:

&gt;On the evening of 20 April, the American flag was hoisted at Adolf Hitler Platz, formally ending the battle.[6]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/n8az3y/soldiers_of_the_us_armys_seventh_army_unit_cheer/gxis83z/,duisThias,1620584239

3158,"&gt;What exactly is your evidence that autonomy caused this issue? You are skipping over this

As stated above.

&gt;Anyone who argues the snp are creating division. They are representing representing their electorate. 

They are trying to create a permanent division. That's their reason to exist. Independence voters want division. That's what idependence is. A division.

&gt;&gt;Just engagement. So meetings about will suffice? Or do you actually want something else, like concessions?
&gt;I know you know this, we discussed it last time round when it game to autonomy. You even have it as a loint further down in this reply. Its a non point, im not sure what you think you are achieving by acting ignorant of it

Saying you want engagement is misrepresenting your own views. Unless engagement without any concessions would be fine. Engagement that leads to no change, is this fine?

&gt;And your point here is what? I assume you have one to compare the dup to the snp when it comes to right wing, authoritarian parties. Im looking forward to this easy answer. Im sure its not a straw man after the fact argument from yourself. 

You are accusing others of keeping bad company. Let's check for hypocrisy. Alex Salmond was the leader of the SNP and led the independence movement for years. Why was such a character able to do so?

&gt;Not really because one, it didn't deliver a majority

Without those Scottish MPs, May is not PM. Scottish votes were vital.

&gt;they would have gone back to the polls with a different leader.

So Scottish votes were vital.

Countless lives would’ve been spared if people didn’t have to fucking swim to the other side in what little gear they had.

EDIT:
In his book “From Soldier to Academician. Memories of the Last Soldier of the Great Patriotic War”, Volodymyr Vasyliovych Khil’chevs’kyi (a participant in the Great Patriotic War, “trench soldier”, order bearer, seriously wounded in action, in the post-war years – a well-known educator, scientist and distinguished professor of NTUU “KPI”) writes: “In the territories of the newly liberated Sumy and Chernihiv regions a military draft began immediately, and soon files of recruits followed in the wake of the attacking military units. Some of these had already served in the army…, but most of them were eighteen- or nineteen-year-old boys. Shabby, bedraggled – wore out their clothes during the war years, with sacks on their backs, they were going and going in an endless flow, never stopping. I was marching in one of such files, too – a farm boy from somewhere between Konotop and Hadyach, eighteen and a half years old. …In the afternoon we were marshalled to take our oaths, and then there was a meeting… Most of us were young recruits, still without uniforms, dressed in our home clothes, not having taken even minimal military training. I, for one, had only a greatcoat (a brand new one, I was its first owner), a rifle and cartridge box. However, unarmed soldiers were more numerous.” Such recruits were called “black jacket boys” or “black coats”.

Special field military commissariats were preoccupied with the equipment of “black jacket boys”. The draft applied to all men capable of holding weapons. Under the martial law the men under occupation were automatically stigmatized as traitors; thus, they had to prove their loyalty to the Motherland with their blood. No military training was given to the recruits; they were often marched into combat without even being given military uniform and weapons.

B. Sokolov, a Russian scholar, writes: “It was thought that “the black infantry” would only wear the Germans out and force them to spend their ammunition stock, enabling the new units to make the adversary retreat from the positions occupied.” (B.V. Sokolov. The Unknown Zhukov: an Unretouched Portrait in the Mirror of the Epoch. – Minsk: Rodiola-plus, 2000) .

Such an attitude towards compatriots, especially new recruits, was astonishing even to the Germans, who called soldiers like those “Beutesoldaten” (“trophy soldiers”).

From “The Diary” by O. Dovzhenko, entry for November 28, 1943: “Today V. Shklovs’kyi told me that a lot of liberated citizens conscripted in Ukraine were dying in combat. They are called black coats or something. They go to war in their home clothes, without any training, just like the soldiers from penal units. They are thought to be guilty. “A general was looking at them in battle and crying,” Victor told me.”

A similar story is told by Anatoliy Dimarov, an author: “When the village was liberated, all men aged between 16 and 60 – everyone with arms and legs, no matter if they were blind or deaf – got drafted. We were “armed”, that is, given half a brick each, and told to “go atone for your faults with your blood,” as we had been in the occupied territory. They must’ve meant we should’ve been throwing bricks, so that the Germans might think those were shells! 500 of us got sent on the ice of the impoundment… only 15 came out! And ten thousand of such unarmed guys got killed outside Izjum!”

Events like these took place throughout Ukraine.

3188,"&gt;You’ve created a strawman by twisting around the phrasing.

Well no not realy. What he is doing is a critic of the strawman interpretation this sub is making out of this poll.

The question is : ""married people having an affaire is moraly unacceptable"" and you need to answer yes or no.

Here you have numerous concept that shows that the interpretation of this poll by this sub : ""OMG the french cheat"" is wrong.

First, it's obvious that they're ask about a generality, other wise the question would say ""you"" or something similar and also the poll would state somewhere that the people aswering were married people.

Second, the question asks for a strong condemnation ""unacceptable"" on a ""moral"" basis. Two thing here :

- for any french person claiming something is unacceptable implies they will take action against it, which if you're talking about cheating on general matter no frenchman has the pretention nor to solve nor to deal with. 

- Moral is not conceived has a proper basis to judge if something is acceptable or not, on a general level.

So overall the proper interpretation of this poll is : 

That less than 50% of the french are willing to judge people severly on moral basis for adultery, whereas it's 2/3rd of the pop in general in other countries.",France,/r/europe/comments/n8g8z9/the_french_and_extramarital_affair_by_pew/gxisvp2/,EdHake,1620584549

Ironically, Stalin was absolutely right that the invasion was a very stupid idea for Germany.

3336,"This lawlessness occured not just in officially ""enemy territory"", this stealing occured also for example in Czech Republlic, where the Red Army was closely followed by SMERSH which took several thousand people to Gulag, mostly Russian emigrés from before ww2, and which also ended up murdering all ROA men they could come across (no matter they were prisoners of war and helped liberate Prague as the only militarily significant thing they ever did). And yes, there have been some Red Army rapes, although to my knowledge no historical research ever considered them systematically.

Also no I don't think the number of 1.4 million raped women in Germany would be over the top, widespread rape is something witness accounts recall particularly in Eastern Prussia, if you don't believe calculated statistics.

Well it started off with a joke, but you took offense at it and required explanations as to how are stolen watches even noteworthy.

But neither can we be forgetful that the Red Army as an institution, as a regime, and with the blessing of political leaders, tolerated or perpetrated many war crimes.

When England denied that, they said they are getting the Euro instead. All of that turned out to be false in the end and it is even less of a positive point now due to, well, drop in oil price. I don't remember many other points SNP made in support for independence, but maybe you do.

3676,"Russia is pretty fucked no matter what it does right now. Putin clearly isn't a great guy, but he did bring stability and stop the freefall of the economy. 

How was it pillaged? Go to Moscow or any other huge city in Russia, and every major road will have at least one American, German, French, etc. business on it. Most of the automotive industry was pillaged by the West, so even local brands are now typically French. 

Meanwhile, if you go to Berlin, Washington, or London, it is hard to find a Russian owned and HQed business anywhere in the city... Unless you look for one. You might find a Russian restaurant owned by a Russian citizen that lives in that country, but you won't find a large corporation from Russia there unless you REALLY try. I would be you could find Gazprom or some other office in Berlin, maybe in London you could find a Yandex office.. *\*googles\* apparently not.* So maybe there isn't anything there. 

I have never been to Russia, but I would bet there is a Microsoft office, over a dozen McDonald's and an office, huge number of other American chain restaurants (subways, Pizza Huts, etc.), Nestle, Daimler, Ford, VW, etc., IKEA, and all sorts of other brands. 

It is rare to find Russian products in the EU as well. I live on the boarder with Belarus, and we have stores that promote Russian products for the people that come here and buy them because of taxes and exchange rates, and they are still rare. Most of the time, these are cosmetics, and there is one major brand I can recognize: Babuszka Agafia. I am too lazy to look up whether it is owned by a Western brand now, but I'll just give it to you anyway. Given the large Belarusian population here, I am surprised there aren't more Russian and Belarusian products available. 

Foreign ""investment"" is just neocolonialism. Rich American, German, Spanish, British, etc. companies will buy up all the local businesses, and then you'll have a country that just works for foreign companies. It is all about profit for these companies, not about Russian rights. That is why the West hates Putin, not because he is a bad guy. The West is happy to work with Saudi Arabia, which has literally been committing genocide, or support a fascist opposition figure in Russia that literally called immigrants cockroaches and suggesting letting them starve, because Saudi Arabia and that figure plays by Western economic and geopolitical rules. All they care about is profiting from Russia, just as they are happy to coup any country in South America that dares try to elect a socialist.",,/r/europe/comments/n7yzl4/happy_eu_day_guys_stay_strong_and_united/gxh8btk/,Comrade_NB,1620548367

I think there were many, many positive aspects of the Novgorod Republic. It had control of lands rich in furs &amp; other resources that it traded with Northern Europe, generating much wealth. It had avoided destruction by the Mongols. Representatives from all social levels in the Republic participated in decision making for the country. All of this was destroyed by Ivan III &amp; IV.

&amp;#x200B;

I imagine had Novgorod won against Muscovy, and later expanded its control over Moscow &amp; Kyiv, a Russia would form that was more open to foreigners, placed great emphasis on trade over military conquest, was *at least* technologically equal to Western Europe, and had a strong tradition of republicanism.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine if American Revolutionaries cited a Russian Republic as their inspiration, with America's red, white, and gold flag flying above the White House. Or a world where the natural competition with England &amp; Spain over trade would lead the Russian Republic to colonize the New World in search of rare goods. Would there be a Mexico whose most famous dishes were chile'd borscht &amp; pelmini tortillas? Would the capitol of Canada be Novopskov? Would the European Union's founding members include the Russian Republic, with Riga, not Brussels, as its center? Would this Russian Republic be able to better withstand the wars of the 20th Century and avoid the deaths caused by the Russian Civil War and the famines &amp; repression brought after? Such a country would have a population hundreds of millions more than today's Russia.

&amp;#x200B;

A Novgorod Russia would have had an incredibly profound &amp; dramatic affect on history, spreading its influence earlier &amp; wider than the Russian Empire was able to.

If you add one more airplane to the carrier, you increase the chance of finding the enemy ship so it never gets in gun range.

4060,"&gt;If there wasn't autonomy people wouldn't be happier, they'd just be denied a means of pursuing an alternative.

How many MPs did the SNP return pre- and post-devolution?

&gt;What exactly is your objection here. 

There should be better reasons for wanting independence than dislike at the campaigning tactics used by one party.

&gt;Its pretty much irrefutable that the government have regularly weaponised dislike of the snp to get their way south of the border. Its generally not perceived well when people's elected representatives are ignored. 

They intimate that Labour would need the SNP to form a govt. The SNP then says they would be willing to discuss it with Labour. The relationship between the Tories and SNP is more symbiotic than most believe.

&gt;Contrary to popular belief, covering your eyes doesent make a problem disappear. 
 
This is not a popular belief

&gt;&gt;This is just a platitude. ""Engagement"" - you want more meetings, discussions. That's it?
&gt;No i want independence, but i cant say that if discussions obtained meaningful autonomy, real autonomy, that my view wouldnt change. 
&gt;However i dont believe in the slightest that such concessions will be given. Certainly not under the conservatives. The same party that screwed scotland over on devolution originally. 

You don't want engagement. You want concessions. Might as well as just write that the first time.

&gt;&gt;Sure, but one needn't just use the figure that makes the Tories look less popular
&gt;
&gt;Whichever way you want to cut it, they are massively less popular outside of England. Whether we go first past the post or proportional.

&gt;The National Shipbuilding Strategy (NSS), formerly the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy (NSPS), is a Government of Canada program operated by the Department of Public Works and Government Services. The NSS was developed under the Stephen Harper Government in an effort to renew the fleets of the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) and the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG).

The older generation usually still had parents/grandparents that spoke those languages, but haven't passed them onto their kids. So there's a good percentage of germans that have a passive understanding of those languages but don't speak them actively. Older southern germans that speak standard german would therefore most likely be able to understand the gist of what us Austrians are saying whereas older northern germans wouldn't be able to understand us at all. Because the southern german languages are more similar to our language they are to the northern german languages. Similarly northern german languages are more similar to dutch than they are to southern german languages. Or used to be at least since most of them are dead by now.

For the average german however what I'm speaking is quite unintelligible and i most of the time have to switch to standard german for a conversation.

As to why it's not recognised, i believe that's because of decades of propaganda in the past where rulers tried to unite all the different peoples that spoke languages from the german sub-branch. Their way to drive that home was by ""making"" everyone speak the same language, i.e. propaganda about how our languages are all the same language. 

And no, germans and austrians are not the same ethnic group. The germans are one ethnic group and us austrians are a separate group as well.",North Tyrol,/r/europe/comments/n6jmko/eurovision_need_to_go_back_to_restricting/gxfm3tf/,Oachlkaas,1620512073
4121,"&gt;Xenophobia is probably more accurate.

We're somehow xenophobic against people from Canada and Australia who've been more erstwhile allies than Ireland ever has to the British. 

&gt;That sloppy word salad could really do with some editing and a spell-check. As far as I can divine it's another of your 'Lol no its not' responses. Are you saying that the insurrection was ... convenient for England? Like the opposite of inconvenient? I'm trying to spot your route to victory here.

I've already won, this is just me trying to explain to you why despite your attempts to deflect from that. 

&gt;You know that non-lazy people can just look this stuff up?
""Britain finally joined the EEC in 1973. By then New Zealand’s exports to the ‘Mother Country’ had fallen to less than 30% of all exports, and within 20 years they would be below 10%. As well as our major export market, Britain had long been New Zealand’s main supplier of imports. When Britain entered the EEC all bilateral agreements between New Zealand and Britain had to be terminated ... From 43% of our total imports **in 1960,** imports from Britain had fallen to **14.5% by 1980.""**

You know non lazy people can actually *read?* as I provided in the previous link, NZ was already on a path to divergence and less reliance on the UK even before it joined the EEC over a 20 year period, that doesn't make it an economic disaster, you know why? Because it wasn't. 

&gt; No, the sea border was to satisfy the EU and US in the hope of getting trade agreements. I asked you to produce a government statement citing that they moved the border for fear of violence and you have still not produced one.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement#Brexit

Why would they have a sea border at all if they thought that having customs borders wouldn't be an issue due to violence, are you really this stupid? The sea border is there because they couldn't put customs infrastructure up on the border, why? Because paramilitary violence made it unviable as a solution, henceforth why there is a border in the Irish sea. 

&gt;You're going to be surprised by the scale of the response if you think travel restrictions and lack of access to goods are solely economic issues.

They are by virtue of them being goods. Barring Corona, there are no travel restrictions on people. 

&gt;That's a two-tier system right there and you won't be able to bullshit the Unionists.

Yeah, they get the better end of the deal by being able to be in the single market, imagine the horror. 

&gt;The internal markets bill already takes competencies away from Scotland and Wales.

Doesn't mean it's rolling back devolution because the body which existed before the IMB was Brussels doing the exact same job. 

&gt;They won't close the parliament, they'll just render it ineffective. 

No they won't because that would render Scotland and Wales ungovernable in the long term. 

&gt;Again that might sound plausible if you're English, but political British citizens will know they're being screwed as they sink further into poverty.

Yup, you're definitely not an Anglophobe. 

&gt;No, you've misread what I said, 'beyond reasonable doubt' is only a standard for criminal law. It's not part of whatever fantasy immigration law you've made up that checks people's DNA. It does not apply outside criminal law.

I never said it using that method was to justify any law, fantasy or otherwise, just that it's a good method of determining somebodys ethnic origin. 

&gt;In fact, it's not any kind of science-based evidence at all.

Except when it is. 

&gt;I've explained why an 'overlapping identity' is still discriminatory. A few times now.

And I've explained how it isn't, over and over again. 

&gt;There are two kinds of racists, ignorant bigots and supremacists but funnily enough both kinds will argue that they don't have a racist bone in their body.

That's interesting on the latter part, kind of like when someone does that, then in the same sentence, lists off the reasons as to why someone could be like that to justify it, weird eh?

&gt;You've already said that Ulster Unionists are not ethnically British. ""Irish people aren't ethnically British, they're ethnically Irish, even the ones in NI who are politically associated with Britain""

As I've stated, again, British identity is primarily based on the ethnicities of the island of Great Britain, and British identity has been extended as an umbrella term for other ethnicities who do not come from the island.

&gt;You've already said that and I've already disproved it; Finland supports naturalisation and does not discriminate between ethnic and naturalised citizens. Don't drone on about Jus Sanguinis again, it's pointlessly boring.

Nah, what's boring is me having to explain to repeatedly how Jus Sanguinis is based on historical association with the country and can be extended to people who have put down roots there but who are not indigenious but who are equal before the law. Just like Israel with its Arab population who live in Israel proper. 

&gt;The point is you don't know your history and it is deliberately kept from you.

I know my history quite well, I don't need an arrogant Irish Anglophobe pretending they're doing me a favour. 

&gt;That's why Britain is repeating all the mistakes it made before. There's not much time left to course-correct now.

4136,"&gt;  it just won't happen.

Not with that attitude. 

&gt; Other than the fact that the number of European countries able to provide for an escort to such a carrier can be counted on the fingers of a short-sighted woodworker, 

Your wood worker will still need to have all his fingers on at least 1 hand then. There's Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Greece. That's more than a handful.

&gt; many countries would try to reduce the scope and capabilities of a ""joint"" ship because they don't want to pay for the possibility to travel to the other side of the world where they don't have any territories or interests, and I doubt that France would have it that way.

I don't actually. The ship doesn't even need to have any fancy deployments. For France it can be considered a back-up ship (which is the primary goal of having a 2nd carrier anyway)

A French crew can train at sea, while its primary carrier is out on a mission. The carrier can be on a mission, while the other is in port for maintenance/upgrades. If battle damaged, France still has a carrier.

For the EU as a whole there's also clear advantages. There's plenty of opportunities for common missions, for example disaster relief, anti-piracy missions, protection of trade routes.

4144,"&gt; I had a Vietnamese-American buddy who was really into singing, and one thing I learned is that it's goddamn hard to write singable songs in Vietnamese because it's a tonal language. Like, in English or a number of other languages, your voice can rise and fall in tone to march the music and it doesn't alter the meaning of the lyrics. Not so for Vietnamese.

You are 100% correct.  On the other hand its very easy
to write poem in Vietnamese because Vietnamese is a 1
syllable language.  Even city like Saigon and Hanoi is actually
call Sai Gon and Ha Noi respectively in Vietnamese.  So
since the Vietnamese language is 1 syllable, writing poem is
extremely easy.  Which was why Vietnam was famous for
poetry before 1975.  I don't really know the origin of the
Vietnamese language or how it come about.  It so different
from other Asian languages within its region.  There are other
tonal languages out there but they aren't as easily

In the regions I lived in I am constantly exposed to anti refugee sentiments and the reasoning is mostly based on either misinformation about the negative impact of refugees on the region, arguing that basically no immigrant legitimately faces prosecution where they are from, the idea that immigrants are culturally incompatible with the regional culture or blatant racism. I wish we could talk about measures that are actually proportionate to the issue and more based on facts than fear mongering. And that we could keep in mind how important the right to asylum is in a democratic nation. Our focus should be on making smart strategic decisions combatting reasons for refugee movements, optimized integration of refugees, especially getting them a job opportunity quickly, finding ways to more effectively check immigration requests while not having people pile up in border countries with horrible living conditions and being more cooperative and especially helping out regions like Greece who have to carry a significantly larger burden.",,/r/europe/comments/n7uhtj/an_austrian_police_officer_guarding_the_european/gxfn7ni/,reddownzero,1620512645

&gt; Armenian Genocide, the massacres against the Kurds and every other crime you keep deny.

You are just a liar. I never said anything like this. A blatant lie of yours, trying to show me as a Turkish ultra-nationalist which I am not (I am not even Turkish).


&gt; Turkey shows it on its own without my help on a daily basis.

Unrelated to our topic. When you have no arguments you just start speaking about Turkey.


&gt; I speak for the vast majority of the population.

There was only one referendum on Enosis, in 1950. It was organized by a church, it wasn't even close to a trustful source of people's opinion, so no, majority maybe, but not a ""vast"" definetely


&gt; You tried to claim that Armenians along with the other minorities were against us.

Never did this. You just started putting this Armenian genocide question in a discussion about Cyprus conflict. They are not related and again you just try to take attention away from our topic


&gt; If the Turks were feeling threatened by Greece, instead of responding with demanding our ethnic cleansing from our island, they could have just returned to Turkey.

Well, Turks could say that Greeks, in the same way, could just go back to Greece from where their ancestors came. 


&gt; Turks occupied our homeland, oppressed us

You keep denying, that Ottomans brought more positive changes than negative


&gt; no Turk ever meant that when referring to partition.

So you know what EVERY Turk is thinking? I didn't know I am speaking with Professor X himself :))


&gt; But that is still segregation, which is also racist and unacceptable.

No, it is not racist. People's movement wouldn't change, just the most local municipalities would be elected by communities separately. What you find racist in that?


&gt; What happened to Crete is what happened to far more Greeks in Anatolia.

And it is all ok? Let's keep going like this?


&gt; The evidence show otherwise.

""The evidence"": a video of unclear origin


&gt; I am exposing the double standards of the Turks.

Yes. And you believe that for this you can just answer questions about Cyprus just by saying that Turkey did sth bad somewhere else? And that Greeks should do the same?


&gt; I never denied negative things done by the Greek or Greek Cypriot side

So you agree that Greeks did ethnic cleansing? You agree that National Guard was created to fight the Cypriot Turks and participated in civilian massacres and did it itself?


&gt; Turks don't know what democracy is

Your typical response on how Turks are pure demons of the deepest hell, to support the undemocratic actions of the Greeks


&gt; Falklands, Gibraltar and Scotland decided

Clearly, understanding on how these countries were created and functions is missing. They are all states of basically one nation. Republic of Cyprus was created as a compromise between Greece, Turkey, UK, Greek and Turkish Cypriots. It was a bi-communal state with unique and power-separating constitution.

True. But Google wasn't giving me the mean by region.

True. It'll probably keep happening, too. And happen to London and other parts of England. 

&gt;As it happens they don't even stand in n.Ireland, they didn't even make double figures in Scotland, and just over a third of the seats in wales.

Bet they'd win a few seats if they ever stood in NI. They got half the votes of the SNP but an eighth of the SNP's seats in Scotland. 

&gt;Unfortunately, they have the deciding vote. Unless there's two equal parties at play, the rest of the uk will never get a word in edge ways

Yes. They are not equal. England has more people. Scotland should either leave the UK or be a more attractive to people choosing where to live if the deciding votes in GEs matter so much. Of course then an independent Scottish GE would be dominated by population centres and some regions would have to leave to have the deciding votes etc

4333,"Sorry, I have had this tab open for 19 days and have felt like a jerk each day I never got around to it.

I use this recipe to make tagliatelle. You will need:

- 225 g thin dark green asparagus
- 350 g durum flour
- 2 large egg yolks

This will yield about 565 g and will supposedly serve 6 to 8 people. (yeah right)

1. Cut off the thougher white bottom 7.5 to 10 cm of the asparagus stalks and either get rid of them or use them for vegetable stock. (not needed for this recipe) Slice the asparagus into 6 mm pieces.
2. Bring 1 cup (235 ml) of salted water to a boil in a pot and add the asparagus. Bring it back to a boil over high heat and cook until the asparagus is crisp-tender and brightly coloured, about 2 minutes.
3. Drain. Shock the asparagus under cold water to set the colour, and drain well.
4. Place the asparagus and egg yolks into the work bowl of a food processor and process until the asparagus is in fine bits.
5. Do the whole ""volcano"" thing with flour in a bowl or work surface. (look it up on youtube or basically just make a volcano shape of flour or just don't even do that because I really don't think it matters) Put the eggs / asparagus into the centre.
6. Incorporate it all into pasta dough with your hands. (if you don't know how to do this, look up making pasta dough on youtube)
7. Knead, etc.
8. Cover and let rest for 30 mins before making it into the shape you want. I think tagliatelle works well.

If you don't have a machine, tagliatelle is very easy to make with a rolling pin and a knife. Just roll some out, use lots of flour, roll it up or fold it in half, and make a bunch of slices according to how wide you want it (or how wide Italians demand it). Then unroll and you've got your long piece of pasta. You can find this technique undoubtedly also on youtube.

You can add olive oil and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano on the finished (cooked) product. Goes well!

Sorry it took so long but at least the green asparagus is out now. Btw, this recipe comes from ""Making Fresh Pasta"" by Aliza Green.",Canadian / German,/r/europe/comments/mtwhkc/oc_european_countries_with_most_produced_fruits/gxeu8u0/,matttk,1620497967

4411,"&gt; First of all, I will need a source on a ''large'' impact on personality, behavior and emotions 

Contemporary biology and psychology might be a good place to look , especially the impact of hormones on personality behavior and emotions. This is not a contested issue .

&gt; Men in Latvia are different animals to what they are in Spain or Sweden  not because of inherent differences, but because how men are raised  here. The physiological differences simply cannot, in my opinion,  explain the huge differences between men of different nations and  cultures. 

Huge difference? You mean things like general behavior towards women and willingness to take part in caring for one's offspring, I guess? The hunter warrior and carer nurturer lines of behavior existed in tribes in the Americas without any contact with the rest of the world (it is still possible for men to be caring and nurturing as it is possible for women to be aggressive and violent, its just not the norm). Swedish men are not feeling more caring towards their offspring than Latvian men, the societal view is just that men should take part in child-rearing. If you look for example at violence and aggression you can probably see that there is very little difference between Latvian and Swedish men compared to females. Latvian men might be more violent than Swedish men which probably comes down to societal issues like violence being more accepted or Latvian men having less access to emotional support on a personal (partners, family ,friends)or societal(you better man up) level .

Men are just more prone to violence than women because testosterone is a hell of a drug. 

Most animal behavior along sexual gender lines are not considered to be learned behavior, why should we be completely or largely unaffected by our biology?

Pretending that our biology has no impact on our personalities, behaviors, emotions and therefore gender norms is nonsensical. 

I am not arguing that all gender norms are inherent or that we all are absolutely the same in a binary system because we aren't, Hormone levels vary among people who are viewed and identify themselves as male or female biologically as well as socially.",Carinthia (Austria),/r/europe/comments/n6wyje/poland_hungary_push_against_gender_equality_at_eu/gxeev6p/,Nihilinius,1620490463
4412,"No world will be doomed if we give up nuclear, at very least we need to keep using nuclear for foreseeable future.

https://www.factcheck.org/2019/11/what-does-science-say-about-the-need-for-nuclear/

""When scientists have modeled the ways the planet as a whole can avoid the worst effects of climate change — and limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels — nuclear power is almost always part of the solution. In the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 2018 special report, scientists described 85 pathways consistent with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, or overshooting that threshold and returning to 1.5 degrees or below by 2100. 

Shindell, who was one of the coordinating lead authors on the chapter, told us that it was a rare scenario that met or mostly met the 1.5 degrees limit and didn’t have nuclear power in the mix. “Very few, almost none in fact, can achieve 1.5 without nuclear,” he said. “It’s a very extreme scenario that can do that. And it requires enormous gains in all the zero-carbon sources.”

A large number of scenarios expanded nuclear power, Shindell said, to around double today’s level. He estimated that 90% of the scenarios included nuclear capacity above today’s level, and just one or two scenarios phased out nuclear entirely by 2100.

There are pathways, the report says, that “no longer see a role for nuclear fission by the end of the century.” But none include no nuclear as early as 2030 or 2050.""

here are two educational videos showing why investing in nuclear is actually GOOD idea, one talks about whatever we need nuclear and second how dangerous nuclear really is.

Listen to luce of elisa or quando due si lasciano of anna tatangelo, and then listen to every breath you take.

Social media is a great help and is how I'm exposing myself to more Gaeilge. I think it is something that could definitely happen, we need to de-anglicise our country if it is to happen(have no problem with British people or anything like that). Recently the EU courts heard it's first case as Gaeilge and it hopefully will become the norm. Successive Irish governments haven't put the effort into bringing back Gaeilge, in the manner we need, and they haven't put enough resources into helping people to revive it themselves. All in all, i think a Gaelic revival is very possible and i think the want for it is there amongst a good part of the population, north &amp; south.

I literally just explained that. It's a popular stepping stone for nazi apologism. Claiming that Germany was an innocent victim of a conspiracy in WW1 to then go on to justify their behaviour in WW2.

None of which matters, because it remains a filthy lie that the Lusitania was armed. It was carrying a small quantity of rifle cartridges and empty shrapnel shell casings in the hold, and that was all. If you have some evidence that the Lusitania was armed, you must report it immediately, because it is the most sensational discovery in world history.

It's only because of pressure from the West and Czechia that they moved their asses, in the barest of ways. The government and many people   have no problem with Russia being able to kill our citizens and shut down our businesses through violence.

Nor with Russia telling us Cyril and Methodius were Macedonian and   saying we were Nazis that occupied Macedonia as part of their wider campaign to enflame Macedonian nationalism against us.  

And all we did was expel a  Russian diplomat for  crap like that and still some people are mad  at Bulgaria and the US, in stead of the Russian assholes that deserved it and more...  

When has Russia ever respected us? Yeah it's obvious they can  offer us close to nothing economically like the West can, but can they at least be respectful? Nope they insult us more than just about any other country, even Turkey or Serbia. Their diplomats wouldn't be caught dead speaking our language in an official manner. Meanwhile   even the Americans (not to mention Europeans) honour  our language, congratulate us in it, fund projects for restoring schools and monuments. But does nothing like that, just complains when  some of their endless monuments to themselves get defaced. 

And then the US is somehow the bad guy to us? I'd understand if we were in the Middle East where they are ruining countries but we have nothing to complain about. It's the Orthodox brothers that are constantly hostile and harmful to us. What do you think would have even happened to Bulgaria if we remained in  their arms with like a hundred  more years of socialist rule? Look at the destruction of Belarusian and Ukrainian culture and language. Look up the changing demographics of Soviet Estonia, Lithuania, even Kazakhstan. Look up the way Imperial Russia treated Poland (they went as far as to forbid speaking Polish in Poland). Russia is a dangerous country with no love for Slavs or for us.

Young people cannot buy houses in premium locations unless they are rich.

This hasn't change a bit. It was the same back then. My parents worked nearly 30 years depriving themselves or luxuries the entire prime of their lives in order to buy a nice apartment around the same value in Paris.

The problem is back then this was see as normal. That's what people did to live. Now it's seen as an agression to people's lives. It's mostly perspective.

You can buy a house for way under 500k if you want to. It's just that you won't find those on crouded cities. The problem as I mentioned are internal migrations and immigration. You can't reduce prices in markets where demand is growing.

As an example, in France, people working in Paris are buying hundreds of miles away for way cheaper and they just commute my TGV (fast trains).

Bottom line is that premium locations are as inaccessible as they were in most places for the common people.

4681,"Scumbag Liechtenstein is definitely a poacher, he had an authorization to shoot a she-problem-bear, yet he shot magnificent Arthur. Now he's lying about having killed just the she-bear. His problem is: there is no trace of a killed she-bear, no documents, no carcass, no skin.  The only bear killed is Arthur, well-documented.

Of course, all that could happen only with the complicity of the Romanian Forest and Hunt Authorities. The prosecutors will find out how widespread the corruption network was in this case, whether only locally or also in the Ministry of the Environment.

The irony of the whole story: the trophy of Arthur (head and skin) is still in Romania to be prepared.(The tanner in Targu Secuiesc said to never having seen such a huge skin before). Since Arthur's trophy is an object to criminal investigation, there is a next to null chance for Shitbag von und zu Liechtenstein to ever see ""his"" trophy.

The physiological differences simply cannot, in my opinion, explain the huge differences between men of different nations and cultures.

&gt; Fashion is really not a good argument to make in the gender is just a social construct debate because it kind of shows that you have two sets separated by sex, the fact that men used to wear skirts is irrelevant. 

No, the argument is that even if we have genders that adhere to sex, the gendered expressions continuously change adhering to changing societal norms and expectations - i.e. gender expression being a social construct.

But hydro is also not too fast to be deployed, I think. Maybe small scale hydro power like the ones from [turbulent](https://www.turbulent.be/) could be deployed faster. Though, it would need many of those to replace the coal power.

&gt;we do not have enough sun for PV

[Why not](https://www.iene.eu/photovoltaic-power-plants-in-slovenia-p5077.html)?

There seems to be [plenty going on](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/solar-power-boom-in-slovenia-almost-2500-solar-plants-installed-in-2019/) in that [direction](https://www.total-slovenia-news.com/business/8230-work-on-slovenia-s-largest-solar-plant-to-start-soon-near-hrastnik). There also seems to be some activity with respect to [energy storage](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/slovenias-idrija-installing-battery-storage-to-become-smart-town/).

But that would need to be much more pushed to replace the coal power by 2024. Looks like solar provided nearly 2% of the electricity in 2020, so they'd need to expand it's deployment 10 fold to replace the coal.

I cannot comment on who was first to *violate property laws* but Europe was trying to block medical exports well before 2021 vaccine production and before the UK-AZ vaccine agreement of 05/2020. 

France and Germany were requisitioning local PPE production in 2020 when Italy needed it, and the EU sought to block export of medical equipment outside of the bloc in 03/2020.

Romani minorities have already been integrated in a lot of countries through both ways, and all the anti-tziganism in Europe is based on the groups that do not want to comply to the local laws and customs, further isolating themselves. The two main approaches run by the EU in the 2000s were the French one, that viewed it as a cultural issue, and the Spanish one, that viewed it as a poverty issue. The Spanish approach had way, way better results, and a better implementation, focusing on legal employment, labour professionalization and education.",,/r/europe/comments/n7dm79/eu_must_make_romani_equality_and_inclusion_a/gxcsny3/,Lord_Frederick,1620447601

5093,"&gt; In a landscape where limestone sits underneath the soil, water from rainfall collects in cracks in the stone. These cracks are called joints. Slowly, as the limestone dissolves and is carried away, the joints widen until the ground above them becomes unstable and collapses. The collapse often happens very suddenly and without very much warning. Water collects in these collapsed sections, forming sinkholes.

&gt;The guy isn't stateless, his mother was from Jamaica and Jamaica has a law stipulating a person is a Jamaican citizen even they're born abroad to one Jamaican parent.

Jesus wept, it's the third sentence in the link I gave to you; [""Though Mr Aristotles is viewed as a Jamaican national through descent, he does not have Jamaican citizenship, which is a separate status.""](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/ace-reule-home-office-deportation-b1841799.html)

&gt;You said constant state of civil war, which India and Pakistan are not in a constant state of. No hyperbole.

""constant inter-tribal, religious and ethnic conflicts"" is the definition of civil war. Pakistan is worse, but India alone has seen [10,000 Muslims massacred since partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_Muslims_in_India).

&gt;Ah yes, like Finland that hellhole with its law of Jus sanguinis. Genocide exists because of lack of governmental accountability.

You've confused birth citizenship with an ethno-national identity. You don't need Finnish heritage to be a Finn and they don't have a tiered concept of citizenship; if you're a Finn, you're a Finn.

&gt;What??? It's not a breach of human rights because a state doesn't implement Jus soli laws of citizenship in a way which mirrors the Americas.

Again accidentally or deliberately you have mixed birthright citizenship up with ethno-nationalism. Examples of the states which have tiered citizenship would include North Korea, Israel, pre-ANC South Africa, Jim Crow America, Rwanda and even Japan to an extent. 

&gt;Haha, which you omit that after 1814, the were unified for almost a century until 1905. Point I've made and which is a valid one, is that the term of Scandinavia isn't some meaningless term which you try to pretend it is.

Now that's an actual strawman; you've changed *'diluted'* to *'meaningless'* and then argued against that. Whereas my counter example to *'Scandinavian identity is rooted in the previous Union of Sweden and Norway'* you shifting the goalposts away from my Danish example) was to demonstrate that they had been at war with each other. That's certainly going to dilute the common identity, don't you think?

&gt;I didn't use that as an example of different categories of citizenship, I said that people can have identities based on particular regions even if they're not unified, just in a diluted form as opposed to a nation state.

So where are we going with these new goalposts? That I have to prove that it's ok to discriminate against British subjects with foreign heritage because the identity is a 'diluted' one? Not in Britain it isn't, you can be made stateless if you've got the wrong background.

&gt;*I certainly didn't mean to hurt your feelings, I don't dislike English people. My grandparents certainly hated Britain though, but then they had to live in a violently-oppressed British colony - much like Indian, Kenyans, South Africans or others of that generation.*  
&gt;  
&gt;There you go, the entire tone of that response with it's insincere apology followed by a reminder as to why people wouldn't like British people, and the way you've conducted yourself throughout the thread pretty much certifies your Anglophobic attitude, which is fine, but at least be honest about it with yourself.

So you don't have an example, you just don't like my insolent 'tone'. If you had actually read that quote properly you'll see it is referring to my grandparents hatred of Britain rather than England or English people. That would have arisen from their abuse at the hands of the British Irregulars during the occupation. I don't know if even they were Anglophobic though - I don't know if they even visited England.

&gt;Okay? But I wasn't contesting that, I was stipulating that the CTA abides by EU law on both sides but that Ireland shadows British legislation in terms of immigration law to ensure the integrity of the agreement.

You didn't read it properly. What I'm saying is that up until this year, Britain and Ireland have both followed EU directives, Ireland doesn't 'shadow' British legislation and no doubt they will diverge in future as Britain veers to the right.

&gt;In the scope of respecting the integrity of the CTA, so divergence wouldn't be an issue, shadowing UK immigration law doesn't mean Ireland copies UK immigration law in its entirety.

Again, they both take their direction from the EU. Ireland has not passed any laws to shadow Britain to my knowledge. You might be able to find evidence of that but you'd have to actually Google it yourself.",,/r/europe/comments/n4i38b/joseph_plunkett_married_grace_gifford_in/gxbq1kd/,defixiones,1620425936

&gt;Irish people, I'm firmly against Ireland having a CTA agreement with the UK but I'm aware that it can't be gotten rid of until NI is reunified with the ROI, but after that, you can get in line, or better yet, spread that latter part around as a discouragement.

So just anti-Irish racism. At least we can agree on the importance of dissolving the CTA, hopefully before those 300,000 British citizens become a burden on our health system like they did in Spain.

&gt;You said they were all at a time when England was distracted, it wasn't during the Fenian uprising, I've said this time and time again and you only changed your tune after the fact

What I said at the time is *""All the uprisings were at an inconvenient time for Britain, this one was more successful""*, you seem to have interpreted that as a challenge to find an uprising that was convenient for Britain. A ludicrous idea, possibly due to an initial reading comprehension failure. What would it even prove if you could find this 'convenient uprising'?

&gt;Uh huh  
&gt;  
&gt;The British government acknowledged that New Zealand was the most vulnerable of its Commonwealth trading partners. Because of this, New Zealand was given what was effectively a veto over British membership of the EEC if it found the terms negotiated unacceptable. Instead, it chose to focus on achieving a favourable outcome for its exports under the Luxembourg agreement of 1971, under which the UK joined the EEC in 1973.

What a smoking gun! How does that change *'Britain joined the EEC, that was both an economic and emigration disaster for New Zealand* '. I notice that Britain joined anyway, despite New Zealand's vulnerability, and New Zealand was plunged into a recession. Notebooks out, Northern Ireland!

&gt;The whole point of there being no border on the island of Ireland is to reduce nationalist tension, I don't need to make it up because if that wasn't the basis of the agreement there would be customs checkpoints in South Armagh right now, the GFA never explicitly states that there cannot be customs checkpoints, what the US and the EU disagreed on was Boris trying to circumvent the sea border arrangements put in place.

The buffoon tried to circumvent the sea border arrangements by switching back to a land border, that's when he got the tap on the shoulder. You may think 'reducing nationalist tension' is the reason for a sea border but the UK government were happy to push for a land border on behalf of the DUP, so they obviously weren't too worried about Nationalist violence.

&gt;Northern Ireland is part of the UK despite your hyperbolic statements to the contrary. The last thing Westminster wants is to bring back direct rule to NI. This is where your latent Anglophobia kicks in with this conspiratorial nonsense.

Why all the riots then? NI is clearly on a different tier of citizenship than Scotland, England and Wales, and they don't like it. I agree that they won't bring direct rule back - that's for Scotland and Wales. They want to be shot of Northern Ireland.

&gt;Again, for those hard of hearing in the back ""Based on beyond a reasonable doubt"" If you think the DNA doesn't help to narrow down a persons lineage to a particular area, then you're beyond reason.

First of all 'beyond reasonable doubt' sounds very clever but it's actually a legal term specific to only criminal law. Secondly, contrary to how you intend it, it is actually a relatively high burden of proof. 23&amp;Me stating that your heritage is *'is heavily present in the UK Ireland Denmark and Norway'* wouldn't be enough to prove you were from Britain.

&gt;Replying with a strawman when asking about a strawman, nice. As I've stated, again, British identity is primarily based on the ethnicities of the island of Great Britain, and British identity has been extended as an umbrella term for other ethnicities who do not come from the island.

It's strawmen all the way down! But seriously, you keep stating the same thing over and over again as if it gets less offensive the more you repeat it. Basing a modern national identity primarily on an ethnic basis is just wrong. I've provided evidence above.

&gt;The racism part? Me saying it's defined isn't stating that it's the sole characteristic, which is what you're trying to pretend I'm saying.

You have mentioned pluralism and ' no one ethnic group completely dominates' but you also say that British genetic ethnicity is 'foundational'. 

My argument is that once you centre ethnic identity, it leads eventually to an apartheid state. It held the Empire together for a while, but then you can see how it fell apart in all the examples we looked at.

My ultimate point is that failure to get to grips with British imperial history and solve this problem will lead to the break-up of the UK and economic penury.

5353,"Pharma is a specific case and complex case :

&gt;France also leads the antivaxxing charts 

The problem with those charts is that you're for or against. Only a Sith deal in absolute. to put a little of context :

* Pharma lobby in France is huge, like HUGE : Pharmaceutics represent more than 56 billions euro of revenue for the companies involved. It is one of the biggest lobbying activity toward the government.
* A lot of sanitary scandal involving those same Pharma company happened since 1950s. One of those scandal was the H1N1 vaccination scandal where the Ministor of health of the time, Roselyne Bachelot, was summoned to the justice, and was auditioned by the senate and the court of auditors for suspicion of collution with the Pharma lobby. Or the biggest recent one : [Mediator](https://www.euronews.com/2021/03/29/french-pharma-firm-guilty-of-aggravated-deception-over-deadly-mediator-drug).
* People have no trust towards those company, whatsoever. It is known some doctors are ""sponsored"" by some Pharma company so that the medication wrote on the prescription come from this laboratory and not another one. They are all unpopular and they never show any sign of being more ""ethical"".

People are untrustworthy and more wary of what Pharma do. So if you ask a french if he trust a specific vaccine, the default answer might be ""No"" if it's new because they just don't trust the Pharma companies that deliver it. If you ask them if they are against vaccination in general, they are mostly for it (even if, I will agree, we have one of the largest antivax community in the world). So that bring the situation where people don't trust the vaccine but they are still ready to get it because they still consider it safer than not being vaccinated. Those people are antivax on those charts.

&gt;however I was amazed by the amount of oscillococcinum in French pharmacies. 

That is true, and for me it is linked with the trust relationship with Pharma company that I talked before. Homeopathy has a HUGE strength compare to other medications (and I want to punch myself to call homeopathy ""medication""). It's just water and sugar. You won't have any bad side effect by consuming a pill of water and sugar. there is no health scandal with dead people because they consumed a pill of water and sugar. So when some people become very wary of true Pharma company and sought an alternative, they fell into that trap.  
And Boiron as a monopoly on homeopathy in France, and it has grown big, VERY big (around 550 millions euros of turnover in 2019). So now it is with all the other Pharma company doing lobbying with the government and the ""sponsoring"" of some doctors. It's not surprising to see doctor put homeopathy on a prescription. They have their grip on the system and it's hard to get rid of it now.

And most people tolerate it. It can still trigger the Placebo effect.",Pays de la Loire (France),/r/europe/comments/n72sov/share_of_the_public_that_think_each_covid19/gxbq4vv/,Nizla73,1620425982

5427,"&gt;The rebellion was against British rule, not each other. I notice you are avoiding the point that there were no Canadian MPs now.

The rebellion was against the legislative government, not British rule. Otherwise the [Patriote movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriote_movement) would have been a bigger issue. 

&gt;The French are still perfectly entitled to protest without being threatened by the British Navy. The people of Jersey were fine with the protest, but unfortunately their wishes came second to a byelection in Hartlepool. Sounds like Empire 2.0 to me.

Looks like you're also perfectly fine with the French government threatening to cut off Jerseys electricity supply and infringe upon its territorial integrity, but then again, I'm not surprised considering you're an Anglophobe. 

&gt;No you're still wrong, he was an EU negotiator with an Irish identity. Ireland doesn't do it's own trade deals. You're barking up the wrong tree.

Yes you're quite right, last time Ireland did its own trade deals, [you didn't fair so well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Irish_trade_war)

&gt;The high stakes/slow process is partly due to the time it takes to negotiate trade deals in general but is also due to Britain's deteriorating trade position. 

Wut? [This is the current situation of Britains trade agreements here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_agreements_of_the_United_Kingdom)

[Compared with the EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_free_trade_agreements)

Obviously the EU position is better by vitue of its size, but the UK isn't in a deteriorating position.

&gt;How so? GNP shows overall profits, GNI shows profits less the international component. GNP doesn't work in Ireland's case because most of the multinationals are foreign rather than domestic. You never looked into any of the figures or the dispute.

While the event that caused the artificial Irish GDP growth occurred in Q1 2015, the Irish CSO had to delay its GDP revision, and redact the release of its regular economic data in 2016–2017 to protect the source's identity, as required by Irish law.[11] Only in Q1 2018 could economists confirm Apple as the source [12][13][14] and that leprechaun economics was the largest ever base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) action,[15] as well as the largest hybrid–tax inversion of a U.S. corporation.[3][16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprechaun_economics)

&gt;You mean I've made you read some wikipedia pages. You tend to be more ignorant than wrong and you've picked up some talking points from the redtops. So far you've been wrong on Canadian citizenship, deportation, when British citizenship was invented, 'national' DNA and my Anglophobia.

You've not made me do anything, I've provided plenty of citations to refute your positions, which apparently your ego can't handle which forces you to act as if you pushed me into ""reading some wiki pages"" You're an arrogant, Anglophobic Irish person who has to resort to strawmanning and pivoting arguments towards the direction you want them to go, because you're not confident in refuting what's presented before you. 

&gt;You've put forward an idea of a foundational ethnic nation adding other nations with a kind of secondary citizenship, but it doesn't seem to work well in any of your examples.

I've explained multiple times that the concept of Britishness and British identity is primarily wrapped around the nations of England Scotland Wales and Cornwall, because they make up the United Kingdom of Great Britain, they're fundamental to the creation of what we have as British identity in the modern era, that isn't translated to what you have repeatedly failed to try and pivot the definition too, which is something based on racial superiority.",British Isles,/r/europe/comments/n4i38b/joseph_plunkett_married_grace_gifford_in/gxbapex/,DrPepperThanks,1620418586

5429,"No, [Pfizer sees it as threat to vaccine supply](https://www.pfizer.com/news/hot-topics/why_pfizer_opposes_the_trips_intellectual_property_waiver_for_covid_19_vaccines).

&gt; Currently, infrastructure is not the bottleneck for us manufacturing faster. The restriction is the scarcity of highly specialized raw materials needed to produce our vaccine. These 280 different materials or components are produced by many suppliers in 19 different countries. Many of them needed our substantial support (technical and financial) to ramp up their production. Right now, virtually every single gram of raw material produced is shipped immediately into our manufacturing facilities and is converted immediately and reliably to vaccines that are shipped immediately around the world (91 countries to date.) The proposed waiver for COVID-19 vaccines, threatens to disrupt the flow of raw materials. **It will unleash a scramble for the critical inputs we require in order to make a safe and effective vaccine.** Entities with little or no experience in manufacturing vaccines are likely to chase the very raw materials we require to scale our production, putting the safety and security of all at risk. 

And also as threat to innovation.

&gt; And I would like to make a final point. I worry that waiving of patent protection will disincentivize anyone else from taking a big risk. We deployed $2 billion before we knew whether we could successfully develop a vaccine because we understood what was at stake. Just recently, I authorized spending an additional $600 million on COVID-19 research and development that will bring our total spend for R&amp;D in 2021 to more than $10 billion .

5588,"&gt; I didnt know kids are not allowed to speak Mundart in schools nowadays? No one would ever want to go through this horror, lol.

I moved to Innsbruck a few years ago and school kids there speak a very watered down version of the local dialect, which i believe to be a combination of a few things, but not being allowed to speak and not hearing your own language for at least half of the day is probably a big part of it. 

&gt;Anyways, I also think that it should be more seen as an own language. Swiss German gets seen this way kind off sometimes.

I would like that too, but it's not gonna happen.

&gt;otherwise communication was impossible

I work in tourism, i know exactly what you're talking about lol

&gt;I always thought that it is weird, that if a lot of people have significant difficulties to understand a ""dialect"" to the point, where even the meaning of sentences cannot be figured out without explanation, that it is not considered ""more than just a funny dialect"" by standard German speaking Germans at least.

Decades of propaganda will do that.

&gt;I am not really into culture and tradition and stuff, but it would be very sad if this amazing sounding branch of German would die of someday.

I'm sorry, you've been suckered by charlatans into believing a lie. 

You know the wreck has been found, right? That divers and submarines have visited it many times, right? There were no weapons on board. 

Some articles in the 1980s filled with made up quotes and innuendo first put forward this idea, but it's absurd. Even their own outlandish claims, that the Lusitania had guns hidden in the deck that could be raised up and deployed in *just* half an hour (uhhh... totally useless against a surprise attack against a submarine) don't make any military sense. 

The ship was unarmoured, so putting weapons on it is just inviting disaster when naval warfare is a ranged slugfest. Any opponent ship could sink it immediately from a range at which its armour is impervious to the Lusitania's supposed gun calibre. Being such a huge ship the Lusitania had near zero manoeuvrability, meaning it would likely be hit in the first or second salvo and torn to pieces.

It was also travelling on a direct trans-Atlantic route, where its odds of encountering enemy shipping (especially with that enemy under blockade) were nil. So it wouldn't even work as a commerce raider. 

It was also one of the most well known and easily identifiable ships in the world, and would have been identified immediately as being nefariously armed, causing a scandal worldwide from the very first time such weapons being deployed. Even the 2,000 civilians on board would have blown the story of how the Lusitania was firing on other ships *with them onboard*, the newpapers around the world would have exploded, with instant condemnation from the US and everyone else.

5748,"Everyone makes a huge deal about the ammunition on board, as if this was a great gotcha for anyone hellbent on absolving Germany of this crime. The problems with this are:

* Sinking merchant shipping without warning and a civilian crew aboard, even carrying munitions, is also a crime. The fact that Germany continued to do so does not suddenly make this any less egregious. For centuries, when you caught an enemy merchant ship, you ordered them to evacuate the ship before sinking it. Many Submarine captains did exactly that, including Germans. 

* The Germans didn't know there were munitions onboard when they sank it, and so wasn't part of the decision they made. If you massacre a town and in the process destroy some hidden enemy ammunition you didn't know about, that doesn't suddenly justify the massacre.

* the ammunition on board was trivial. There was never any serious attempt to hide it (despite what conspiracy theorists claim). A single merchant ship carried many thousands of tonnes of munitions, you'd need to sink dozens of Lusitanias just to destroy one merchant ship's worth of munitions. The munitions on the Lusitania were added as an afterthought to fill all the hold space to ensure cost effectiveness. 

Passenger airliners still do this today, carrying freight up to their weight limit in the cargo hold in addition to passengers and their luggage. We're a little more careful with what freight they carry now, but the ammunition was stable and rated extremely safe to move. Missing Malaysia airlines flight MH370 supposedly had 100kgs of batteries in its freight leading to speculation they started a fire. 

Sometimes people of the time were right, and hindsight hasn't actually given us a better understanding of the situation.

5901,"&gt; Try asking all the educated Italian migrant workers, that have to leave Italy to stand any chance of employment, how ridiculous this statement is. 



Looking at the migration numbers for 2019, 4190 people left from the Netherlands to Italy and 8706 came here from Italy. 2018 is somewhat similar at 8144 / 3935.

Hardly a 'massive brain drain'. [1](https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/60032/table?fromstatweb)

&gt; Also interested to learn what metric you've found to say that Italy is ""richer"" - since it's not, by any reasonable one.

Just looking at wealth figures. The median wealth per capita in Italy is 300% of that of the Netherlands. [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult)

&gt; That's not going to do you much good if you can't get a decent job even if you spoke Italian, will have similar cost of living in areas that have some semblance of a job prospect (i.e. Po valley),

Looking at the average rent cost in the Po valley that seems to be around 11-12 € per m2 (2020). [3](https://www.statista.com/statistics/818778/average-monthly-price-for-properties-for-rent-by-region-in-italy/). 

In the Netherlands the average rent price per m2 is €16,8, but for example in Amsterdam (where the jobs are for migrants) it's €23,8 (2019). [4](https://images.prismic.io/pararius/1dbf561b-35c7-46a3-9431-0463cb523584_NL+AMS.svg?auto=compress,format&amp;rect=0,0,2082,799&amp;w=740&amp;h=284)

5939,"&gt; she’s an activist but the only activity she does it repeating the talking points of her supervisors.

This point of view is so non-sensical. You assume that because she's a kid and maybe when you were her age you had no opinions of your own then she surely is just repeating what someone else told her. You can't accept that maybe if you have a class discussion about climate change and you show teens the consensus on climate change and some of the scary stats they wouldn't develop an opinion on this on their own. Kids are not just information sponges. They can have some agency and critical thinking skills. 

&gt;Everyone knows her name. Go ask someone in the street if they know Boyan Slat

Sounds like tribalism to me. I like A team and everyone is cheering for B team. Why don't people cheer for A team as well? Well mr Slat has received plenty of recognition and fame as well. 

* In November 2014 Slat was awarded the Champions of the Earth award of the United Nations Environment Programme.

* HM King Harald of Norway awarded Slat the Young Entrepreneur Award in 2015.

* Forbes included Slat in their 2016 ""30 under 30"" list In 2016.[24]

* He was selected for a Thiel Fellowship, a program started in 2011 by venture capitalist and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel. It gives $100,000 to entrepreneurs 22 years old and younger who have left or postponed college to work on their start-up.

* In February 2017, Reader's Digest appointed Slat European of the Year,[25] and the Dutch magazine Elsevier awarded him Nederlander van het Jaar 2017 (Dutchman of the Year 2017).

* In 2018, Slat was awarded the Leonardo da Vinci International Art Award and Euronews award ""European Entrepreneur of the Year"".

So almost like you're again just projecting again. Also Greta was a kid in 2017-2018 and addressed a different demographic so then had a different media appeal. Also social media had a totally different scale in the last 3 years to propagate a viral message compared to around 2016.  She has a wider ranging message while Boyan is focused on the plastic problem. Which is important but climate change =/= plastic pollution. It's just another side of the man made destruction of the environment. 

There are plenty of objective reasons why you see Greta's name pop up more often than Boyan.But that wouldn't feed into your victimisation and weird fixation with a teenage girl rightfully saying she and fellow kids should be pissed that adults are acting the way they are and dragging their feet with something so important. 

&gt; And she has singled out the EU and America

No she hasn't. More projection. You feel personally attacked so you are defensive. It's natural. She addressed the goddamned General Assembly. China was there.
