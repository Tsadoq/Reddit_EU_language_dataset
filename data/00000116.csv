I was surprised by the reasoning ""germany was responsible for WWII, therefore we cant trust them in a unified army"". 

Now, a unified EU-army would neccessitate a de-facto EU-nation; otherwise it would beg the question which countries would use the unified army in order to advance their own agenda's. 

That being said, and what my original point was, i do think that it is correct, that the EU as a whole (all member states) need to increase their military spending, so that, should the time come, we would be able to defend ourselves and assist one another effectively. 

If the Trump presidency has proven one thing, then its that the times, where we thought we could always depend on the assitance and security of the US are over. 

We already have some of the mightiest militaries in the EU (France, Germany, Spain + UK, who albeit leaving, still is a big ally) so i dont think its a bad idea to even further increase our military capabilites.

First of all, you have to understand that legal age for consensual sex is 18, so if some guy 19 has consensual sex with a 17 year old girl, it is still counted as rape. Also in southeastern regions (majority Kurdish) child brides (under 18) is very common, if one of the parties are under 18, even if they both agree, this still counts as rape. The aim of the bill is to eliminate people being persecuted even when both parties consent, especially if they already agreed to marry beforehand. 

**THIS BILL DOES NOT FORCE WOMEN TO MARRY.** 

However, even if the aim is to eliminate unjust persecutions, I totally agree that this bill might cause unwanted effects, especially given that women don't have much power of saying no, so if there was a real rape and the families somehow made a deal, the girls might be forced to marry their real rapists just because the family got paid or something.",Swarje,/r/europe/comments/eshhen/marryyourrapist_bill_to_be_introduced_by/ffbrs24/,hakan_carrier,1579780230

&gt; 
&gt; *  Hungary plunges most in EU in Transparency corruption index
&gt; *  Prime Minister Orban‚Äôs power centralization seen fueling graft
&gt; 
&gt; Hungarian state bodies that should be defending the rule of law are by now ‚Äúmostly brain dead‚Äù as appointees loyal to Prime Minister Viktor Orban enable institutionalized corruption, Transparency International said.
&gt; 
&gt; That explains why Hungary plunged more than any other European Union nation in the graft watchdog‚Äôs annual index over the past eight years, the Hungarian chapter of the Berlin-based organization said on Thursday. Hungary ranked 70th in the 2019 Corruption Perceptions Index, tied with Romania in being seen as the second-most corrupt EU member after Bulgaria.

&gt; The extent of Orban‚Äôs centralization of power over the past decade is ‚Äúextremely unique‚Äù in the EU and has allowed the government to funnel public funds to a new, politically-connected elite largely with impunity, the watchdog said. The EU is currently investigating Hungary over suspected rule-of-law violations while the bloc‚Äôs biggest political group is considering expelling Orban‚Äôs party.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúNowhere in the EU does a government, a state and ultimately one man, the prime minister, have this much power,‚Äù Transparency International said. ‚ÄúThe erosion of the rule of law is at once a cause and a result of institutionalized corruption.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; The government has consistently rejected assessments suggesting graft is a bigger problem in Hungary than elsewhere. More recently, Orban has argued that the country‚Äôs strong economic growth and booming investments wouldn‚Äôt be possible if graft was so widespread.",Nino G is my homeboy,/r/europe/comments/ess4dr/hungarys_ruleoflaw_bodies_mostly_brain_dead/ffbsegn/,vernazza,1579780961

While unenforceable and considered primarily symbolic, the declared zones represent an attempt to stigmatize and exclude members of the LGBT community. As of September 2019, around 30 different LGBT-free zone declarations have been made in Poland, including four voivodeships in the south-east of the country: Lesser Poland, Podkarpackie, ≈öwietokrzyskie, and Lublin.
Project - LGBT-FREE ZONES in Poland is a response to resolutions of local city councils. City or province councils declare that they will defend the Christian values, schools and traditional family against the influence of LGBT ideology.

106,"As Pascal Lamy (former WTO Director-General and EU Commissioner for Trade) has said, repeated comparisons to the EU-Japan and the EU-Canada deal are egregiously misguided. People who raise these examples show themselves up as someone without a clue.

The starting point for the UK-EU negotiations is *completely* different. Instead of beginning from a position of no FTA and working to agree areas where existing barriers can be relaxed (as was the case for Japan and Canada), the UK discussions start from complete and total alignment on regulation and standards and with no barriers to trade, and then proceed to agree areas where barriers will be *introduced*. 

Anyone who thinks that trade discussions with the UK will take as long as previous trade deals done by the EU clearly doesn't understand the dynamic. 

Unlike deals with other 3rd countries, the future trading relationship with the UK can be managed in stages, in fact it makes far more sense to; this is what it means to manage things in an orderly way. 

No one, not even the UK government, believes that *everything* can be sorted out in the next 11 months, that is not the point. What can be accomplished in this period is the first phase of a broader series of agreements intended to eventually cover all aspects of the future relationship. 

This is precisely why the UK is insisting on the Dec deadline, to force the EU to approach the issue in a more pragmatic and sensible way. There is no reason why some sort of sector specific deal cannot be agreed by the end of the year, with other issues kicked down the road to be sorted out at a later date, with existing rules maintained for the foreseeable future. 

If the EU wants to continue to insist on an all or nothing strategy then the latter is what they'll get. Unlike much of the previous 3 years, if there is no deal by the end of the year then this will be solely down to the Commissions intransigence, they won't have Parliament to bail them out this time. However,  its unlikely that they'll be able to maintain this approach indefinitely as there are already cracks beginning to show on what various member states think is reasonable. The supposed unity shown by the EU27 in the first stage of this process is now considerably more vulnerable to competing interests and the clash between ideology and pragmatism.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/esh907/the_eu_is_planning_to_give_the_uk_a_much_worse/ffbmi03/,MyFavouriteAxe,1579772716

318,"&gt;have to be seriously on some far right Polish propaganda coolaid

For you to make this accusation after comparing the Kingdom of PL, which was known as one of the most tolerent states in Europe for its time, to Soviet and Chinese levels of persecution, is just bad mockery. I belive these atrocities happened, in your imagination. 

When did Poland deport a whole ethic group and repopulate it like the Crimean Tatars? 

Where were the concentration camps the Polish Kingdom supposedly sent the ""Ukranians"" for ""re-education"" like the Uighers? 

In what way were the ""Ukranians"" reduced to 3rd rate citizens? Explain the mechanism they used for this, Did they ban Ukrainian language? No. Where there [No Irish Need Apply](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-teen-who-exposed-a-professors-myth) signs for ""Ukranians"" like there were for Poles in Imperial Germany or Irish in America? No. 

&gt;quite literally enslaved (not only by them, though, gotta give them that). They weren't deported, but simply forced to become the lowest of the low by force and policies.

They were not ""forced to become the lowest of the low"" , some remained peasant serfs while others were made lords and nobles, and this was not some government policy aimed at suppressing a particular ethnic minority but just the standard social structure of Europe during the middle ages, maybe you never heard of this word but its called feudalism. And this applied to the Polish peasantry as well, yes, there were Polish serfs too. 

Somehow you think the existence of ""Ukrainian"" serfs makes Poland into some soviet oppressive yoke. When Ruthenian lands were incorporated into the Kingdom did you think every single ""Ukrainian"" would be knighted and made a lord? WTF is wrong with you. 

And the Cossack movement started before Polish influence, when the Rus state collapsed the People by the Dnieper had to defend themselves  from Tatar raids so they formed militias. Yes later Serfs were allowed to escape serfdom and join the Cossack militia because if they cant deliver their feudal lords quota at least they would be defending thier border from raids. Some Polish nobles even joined not because of feudalism but to fight Tatars.

I more for the intent than the means. Sure, Poles were no Soviets, but also the Soviet way of repressions was not yet possible at that time, so they simply went with... wait hold on, there's something interesting.

&gt;Where were the concentration camps the Polish Kingdom supposedly sent the ""Ukranians"" for ""re-education"" like the Uighers?

""Forced polonization"" sounds kinda like ""re-education"" to me, chief.

The only way to become *shlakhta* (sorry, dunno how to properly write it in Polish so I'll just go with Ukrainian) was to give up your religion and language and go ""full Pole"". 

Yes, there was no Polish NKVD storming inside your house if they hear a glimpse of Ukrainian. But you also weren't going very far speaking it either - you're going to the fields. And that's exactly who the ""third-rate"" citizens are (they're actually not even citizens) - peasantry.

474,"No 'they' ( It's not even the same officers after 26 years obviously, unless the implication is that Netanyahu is somehow giving this order from above, which he's not even authorized to do in relation to police affairs ) did not perform the 'same trick'. What happened with Chirac was that security personnel shoved aside various Palestinians, journalists and aides in what Netanyahu who was PM at the time too said was 'over-zealousness' to protect him shortly after the assassination of Israeli PM Yitzhak Rabin, and he also refused to enter church because Israeli soldiers were posted outside the church.

Back then, the soldiers who are just posted outside regularly also left when Chirac asked them to leave and Chirac said that he considered the incident closed after Netanyahu apologized to him and asked for his help in negotiating a peace agreement. This time around, Israeli police who obviously also consider East Jerusalem to be a dangerous area thought they should enter with Macron, which apparently caused Macron to think whatever he thought, but the cops simply stayed outside when he said he doesn't want them there, and much like Chirac, Macron said that everything ended pleasantly, and furthermore told the head officer in the video itself that they 'did a great job in the city' ( Securing his trip ), but must avoid going into the church itself.

In both cases I'm also still not sure which 'rule' they are referring to. I don't know of any actual law in France itself that would prevent an Israeli policeman in Jerusalem from entering the church, even if the claim ( Also not officially legalized as far as I understand ) that it's French territory is accepted. For example, tourists entering the church aren't expected to present their passports due to 'moving between Israel and France' or any other transitional checkup.

Therefore I don't find it necessarily surprising that there is confusion surrounding what is essentially a French *sentiment*, not a written law. After expressing the sentiment, Macron was instantly told that they'll stay outside at his request, and he confirmed that he later shook hands with them - which I don't think is just a diplomatic decision, because he says the same thing to the Israeli Security Service commander who's standing near him.",,/r/europe/comments/esgnas/emmanuel_macron_loses_temper_with_israeli_security/ffb9yo3/,Questiori,1579756745

Who can't meet their targets but just fiddle the figures instead.  Which then gets used by Beijing to work out the GDP.  Over the last five years or so the methods used by the statistics department to account for this has been reduced.  They used to monitor the brightness of cities and roads  at night from satellites.  The more light being given off the higher the GDP. 

NK is a complete farce.

The US like all Western governments does a best effort attempt to work out what its GDP is.  It is for instance extremely hard to work out the size of the black economy and some actions are only seen to boost the economy if they're paid fo but not if they're unpaid for e.g.  baby sitting and hair dressing.  If your parents babysit your child for free.  It doesn't effect GDP but if you paid a baby sitter $10 per hour it increases GDP.  If you go to a hair salon and pay $30 for a hair cut it increases GDP but not when a friend/neighbour/relative does it for free.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/esaly0/its_22_of_january_2020_and_it_means_that_ukraine/ffayutz/,Tony49UK,1579747670

You do understand the difference here?!

AoC means a &gt;16yo can CONSENT to have sex with anyone they want (the ""authority figure"" thing is a blanket statement that can apply to literally ANYONE older with adequate legal assistence).

But if there's accusation of RAPE (no consent), the perpetrator can't just go ""oh sorry, my bad, I guess I'll have to marry her then when she turns 18"".

Although that is regarding the bill from 2016, depends on whether they changed it so far. Giovanni here might be correct.

There's also the fact that in Turkey you can't marry under 15 (not legally at least), so this law could only be realistically applied to 15-18 year olds, so not that big difference to Europe where it's 16 for many countries (to get married)

So there is at least some truth to what Giovanni is saying.

-	Ukraine is a country known for being fertile and producing a lot of food. Their flag represents wheat fields with the skies above. I know there is a nationalist version of the ukranian flag which represents Ukraine at night: black at the top and red in the bottom.
-	Lots of superstitions, one of them is that you can‚Äôt accept a sharp object as a gift from someone otherwise you‚Äôll become enemies. You have to buy it, even if for a symbolic amount.
-	Chernobyl.
-	Lviv used to be part of Poland.
-	Odessa is really old and looks beautiful in pictures.
-	Euro 2016.
-	They‚Äôre at war with Russia.
-	Used to be part of the USSR.
-	Probably the most good looking women in the world.
-	Probably a culture that values good education? Always regarded them as generally smart. The stereotype for ukrainian immigrants here in Portugal would be of someone who used to be a doctor in Ukraine who now worked in construction or cleanings with a kid in school that outperformed everyone else.
-	Ukranian has letters that Russian doesn‚Äôt, like the ¬´–Ü¬ª whereas russian would have ¬´–Ω¬ª, I think?

Defaulting to the simplistic ""because Islam"" negates the possible effects of economic, social and not religion-based cultural factors. Stating that Muslims have higher birth rates across all regions doesn't say much when the regions you use as examples are as economically, socially and culturally heterogenous as ""Asia-Pacific"" - other factors are not controlled for. The Muslim world is not a monolith, and that average fertility of 2.9 is an arithmetic mean of countries that couldn't be more different, like Albania (fertility rate of 1.5) and Niger (fertility rate of 6.5).

858,"A guide on beating children has been released. ""It is an expression of obedience to God's commands"" Facebook / [Requajace.pl](https://Requajace.pl) \- Magdalena Komsta

""Tell your child how many slaps he will receive. **Remove things that can neutralize punishment (diaper, UNDERPANTS, etc.)**"" - is the excerpt from the book ""Shepherd of the child's heart"" published by *psychologist* Magdalena Komsta on the web. The author of the book also warns parents that ""**some are even ready to report to the police that you spank your children**."" The case shocked the Ombudsman for Children.

&amp;#x200B;

Magdalena Komsta, a psychologist and pedagogue as well as the author of the parenting blog [Requaturing.pl](https://Requaturing.pl), received from one of the readers a photo of the book **Tedd Tripp's ""Pasterz heart serce""** publishing house **""Word of** ***Truth*****"".** According to the expert, the guide is definitely harmful and promotes beating children and even infants as a punishment.

&amp;#x200B;

Tedd Tripp is a pastor, and as we read on the publisher's website, ""*a valued specialist in counseling, education and pastoral care.*"" Privately, he is a father of three children and a grandfather of seven grandchildren.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the fragments of his book reads:

**""Make sure the child understands what he has done wrong. It often takes some time. Often children will try to hide the truth at all costs, even going to lie. Conversation may then look like this:**

&amp;#x200B;

\- Daddy told you to pick up the toys, right?

\- Yes

\- You didn't do what I ordered.

\- Yes.

\- You know what Daddy has to do now. **I have to slap you. ""**

&amp;#x200B;

**""Thanks to this conversation, you can find out that the child knows why he gets spanked**,"" we read further in the book.

""Put the baby on your lap""

&amp;#x200B;

**The author also points out that ""punishment must be an expression of your obedience to God's commands and concern for the good of the child.""**

&amp;#x200B;

Further we read: ""tell the child how many slaps he will receive. (...) Remove things that can neutralize the punishment (diaper, **underpants** etc.). Immediately after the punishment, put the clothes back. It's best if you put the child on your lap instead of on the chair or bed. ""

&amp;#x200B;

The author of the book also wrote what to do when a child begins to object. ""Rebellion can be the baby's protests before changing the diaper, or stiffening when you want to put them on your lap. **The punishment procedures are always the same**."" Tedd Tripp also warns that ""**some are even ready to report to the police that you spank your children**.""

&amp;#x200B;

In the next passage, the author points out that when his oldest child was about eight months old, he and his wife ""**first encountered the need for confrontation**."" ""Certainly **it was big enough to be punished**,"" he says.

&amp;#x200B;

""Incites to crime""

Thousands of comments appeared under the Komsta entry. ""**Scandalous! Of course, we will take action in this matter**!"" - we'd call the Foundation We Give Children Strength.

""I am definitely FOR PUNISHMENT! **Punishment of mindless adults contributing to the dissemination of such content**, which is why, in my opinion, all these institutions (including the prosecutor's office, the Ombudsman for Children - ed.) Should be notified of this hideous"" work ""because **incites to crime** ""- said one of the Internet users.

The publishing house ""**Word of** ***Truth***"" also took the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

""In connection with the controversy around the book by Tedd Tripp"" Shepherd of the Heart of a Child "", a decision was made to *temporarily suspend* its sale. In the coming weeks, a decision will be made to re-sell or withdraw from the offer. The decision will be announced in a separate message"" - we read in the entry on Facebook.

&amp;#x200B;

[Polsatnews.pl](https://Polsatnews.pl) contacted the Ombudsman for Children for the book.

\- The Ombudsman saw this content. **He is shocked that this is true at all**. **The Ombudsman will deal with the matter as a matter of urgency. As soon as possible, he should have withdrawn this book from the market as soon as possible** \- we heard in the press office of the Office.

&amp;#x200B;

""Word of *Truth*"" belongs to the Baptist Church in Poland.

915,"&gt; The reason Russia is suspicious of NATO is because every military invasion they have been subjected to over the last 100 hundred years has come from Western Europe. And I think I don't have to remind you which countries specifically tried to invade.

I know.

&gt; Besides that I'm of the opinion that NATO is not a threat to Russia in and of itself. We have no intention of invading Russia, just to protect ourselves and other democratized nations that identify with the NATO member countries character. 

The notion of NATO being only about ""just protecting itself"" was thrown out of the window when NATO had a non-defensive military campaign in the Balkans. So why should Russia think that it could not happen to them?

Russia had also no intentions of invading Eastern Europe, yet Eastern Europe was afraid of that. Why could that be? And before you say ""but Russia did invade countries"", I'm talking about the moment they joined, because in a hypothetical future, which Russia wants to prevent, NATO could also invade Russia and then Russia could also say ""see, they did invade"".

&gt; Because that is what it's all about. Regular people want to feel safe and don't want war. But that does not mean that there aren't any bad actors out there who feel the same about a 'live and let live' mindset.

Yes, the same reason is why Russia is opposed to NATO.

You know what could have worked? Dissolving NATO or at least not expanding it with the understanding that Russia doesn't do stuff. Russia would have much more reason to play nice, simply because they would know that NATO or something very similar would arise again, which would only endanger their security, which is why they are against NATO in the first place. This way they would have had much more practical reason to play nice. It's basically more or less carrot and stick.

Now what is the situation now? When they were weak and did play nice, their security was ignored even though they were quite vocal about it and the relations were very warm. Our time line had basically only stick and stick at least in regards to Russia's national security, a thing most countries value the most. So why should a country care about acting nice, if they get the carrot anyway?

Acting nice would have prevented the creation of a big security threat for them, but in our timeline acting nice only increased the security threat for them. Now that they are not acting nice, the security threat actually stopped expanding. 

So what is the message of this for a country which values security the most (as do most countries btw)?",Germany,/r/europe/comments/eri65b/eu_to_expand_sanctions_on_turkey_over_east/ff9l3l1/,CDWEBI,1579715276

This armed conflict is part of the civil war. RSFSR with Lithuania and the Germans occupying it in 1918-1919.
But without even going into the details of this co-conflict. What does this have to do with the actions of Poland that occupied this territory and held it until 1939?

&gt;No, Suwa≈Çki agreement was a truce, that established demacration line between Polish and Lithuanian armies, Vilnius wasn't even mentioned

do not lie. The reunification act of the Vilnius Region, adopted by the Constituent Seimas in Warsaw on March 22, 1922, unilaterally became part of Poland. This is a historical fact.
The July 12 agreement did not say anything about the border between Lithuania and Poland - this item was stopped for negotiations between the two restored states themselves. On October 7, 1920, in Suwalki, the authorized delegations of Lithuania and Poland signed an armistice agreement, which was supposed to begin on October 10. The agreement stipulated a demarcation line between the two states along which Vilnius departed for Lithuania. But on the eve of the entry into force of the agreement, the Polish general Lucian Zheligovsky, staging a riot of Polish soldiers and residents of Vilnius region, took a sharp throw to Vilnius and created the state of Middle Lithuania here.
In 1922, Middle Lithuania was annexed to Poland.
Poles are the last nation on earth that has the right to speak of betrayal. Poland literally does not deserve any sympathy.
Hyena Europe

&gt;I aggree with you completely. Soviets treacherously broke all previous agreements, proving they are untrustworthy

I am glad that you agree with the fact that Poland deserved what it received in 1939. After Poland has occupied lands that it does not own, it is foolishly hoping that someone will forgive you for this.

&gt; Weird flex. Just admit you narrative is worth shit. USSR captured in 1939 not only territories of Polish state, but also undoubtely Polish ethnic lands.

I am glad that you agree with the fact that Poland deserved what it received in 1939. After Poland has occupied lands that it does not own, it is foolishly hoping that someone will forgive you for this. The USSR returned Polish ethnic lands after the Germans were expelled from Poland.
I touched only part of the eastern part of the conflict. But the Poles also captured Upper Silesia. And they tried to capture parts of Czechoslovakia.

1990: 380 km of highways

2005: 850 km of highways

2019: 4200 km of highways

I'm not sure if we can say those improvements itself would be enough to make the number of deaths decrease, but it seems totally certain that it is a necessary precondition so that the number of accidents didn't rise when the number of cars increased 3 times.

The driving culture improved a lot too, which is definitely a very big factor here. Also driving under alcohol's influence was still rather socially acceptable in 1990 and became totally socially unacceptable until 2005+ or so, which is a pretty rapid change. Additionally the number of motorways is not a plus solely because those roads allow higher safety, but also because, when, even as late as 2005, many people who wanted to drive from side of the country to the other needed to drive say 700 km of which 600 km was a single carriageway road through many built-up terrains with a need to constantly overtake lorries, it quite strongly incentivized people to drive over the top because they had no other way to make the route in a time which they found acceptable.

1054,"&gt;He was offered the chance to be the King of a constitutional monarchy

""Offered the chance"" is a very charitable way of saying ""held at gunpoint, kidnapped and forced to accept the demands of Paris.
Should he have used this opportunity to his advantage? Sure, but that's easy for us to say given that we know what would happen.

&gt;elected to call for foreign armies to invade his own country

If you're referring to his flight attempt, then yes, that's probably his biggest mistake. He had a poor sense of what was going on outside the capital, was indecisive and ultimately caved to the Queen's demands.
I'm not going to defend that disaster, though it is important to understand things from his perspective. If Louis knew what was really going on and wasn't so indecisive, I don't think he would have gone through with the flight attempt.

&gt;not to save his throne but to save his absolute power

France at this time was an 'absolute' monarchy in all but name. Hence why he had to call the Estates General, because neither the Clergy nor the nobles would cave to getting taxed.
If his power was absolute he could have just told them to go fuck themselves and start taxing them, but he couldn't.

&gt;He bankrupted the country to help the American insurgents just to get back at Great Britain

It wasn't ""just to get back at Great Britain"". He thought that the Americans would want to repay France for helping them gain independence. Eitther through reparations or the restoration of a few colonial posessions.

The Americans decided to leave France hanging, giving them very little for their major support.

&gt;He wanted to maintain an unfair fiscal model whereby the poorest paid taxes and the richest did not.

He literally did not. He didn't want to maintain it, he **had** to.
He realized that France's debt crisis could never be resolved if the other two estates didn't pay their fair share.

The main problem was that Louis was pretty weak-willed and indecisive. In hindsight he should have used the 3rd Estate to his advantage to coerce the other two estates to agree to taxes.
He certainly did not **want** the nobles to remain tax-free, he realized that was impossible. But navigating around the nobles would require Louis XIV levels of charisma, and Louis XVI just wasn't that kind of person.",Kingdom of France,/r/europe/comments/eryohh/on_this_day_in_1793_louis_xvi_of_france_was/ff9aizx/,Anthemius_Augustus,1579708568

It would be victim blaming, if I blamed Ukraine for wanting to join NATO. I blame NATO members for expanding or maintaining NATO. Quite the big difference.

Since when is not being part of NATO being a pet to Russia? Is Finland a pet to Russia? Finland wasn't part of NATO, even during USSR times. And one of the main reasons why Finland was not part of NATO is because it decreased tensions and problems.

So yes, I do blame NATO-members for doing stuff which in the end predictably created big tensions.

&gt;  
&gt;In July 1974, Turkish forces invaded and captured 3% of the island before a ceasefire was declared. The Greek military junta collapsed and was replaced by a democratic government. In August 1974 another Turkish invasion resulted in the capture of approximately 37% of the island. The ceasefire line from August 1974 became the [United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Buffer_Zone_in_Cyprus) and is commonly referred to as the Green Line.

So basically they invaded to protect Turkish cyprians, but they then used this to occupy the northern part of Cyprus illegally and declare it an independent state in 1983. All actions opposed by the UN.  For more background because it stems from friction between greek and turkish cypriots before 1974 and before the coup you can read this wiki :   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish\_invasion\_of\_Cyprus#First\_Turkish\_invasion,\_July\_1974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus#First_Turkish_invasion,_July_1974) 

Nevertheless they occupy it illegally and UN is sanctioning them accordingly, since the UN doesn't recognize the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.

Which will get onto peoples nerves to a degree that in the future you can bet people will refer to ""polish deathcamps"" simply because they know how much it triggers you guys. In fact, I already see it now. This is a battle that will and in fact already has backfired. 

This, btw, is not a judgement, but an observation. When people hate something, then it is constant wise asses especially in regards to a topic that appears to be purely about semantics. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The thing that rubs me the wrong way is this lack of acknowledgment. When an Ukrainian says ""it's Ukraine, not *the Ukraine*"" and explains that adding *the*  strips their country of sovereignty and paints it as a Russian  province, no-one bats an eye. When we say that calling the Nazi camps  Polish is hurtful, all hell breaks loose. 

I never heared about that Ukraine issue here ever before. And yeah, I can fully see that eventually leading to hurtful eye conditions for all the eye rolling as well. Same with the Netherlands who wants to push it is, in fact, the Netherlands and not Holland. Important for the people living there maybe, but nobody else really gives a fuck. 

&gt; It's kinda like ""why can't I call them *the blacks*"" or ""what's wrong with saying *the gays*"". Words matter. 

It does not matter when ""polish deathcamps"" are absolutely correct definitions.

When police officers start deciding that dealing with a specific crime might cause ""community tensions"", and then start ignoring it, they create the exact thing they are worried about, because in the north of england, you could get away with trafficking children if you were a muslim, *because* the police knew about it, and thought things might get complicated for them if they did anything. There was a void in policing, filled by victim after victim.

There are problems with police being racist, this didn't fix that, they still on the ground level tend to treat muslims worse, searching them more often etc. but instead of dealing with that on the ground, they reacted to their earned community reputation by flipping the opposite way at a higher level, giving actual known criminals of the worst kind impunity, and this kind of unequal treatment is only going to make racial tension worse.",,/r/europe/comments/es4xf2/the_grooming_gang_coverup_is_britains_real_racism/ff8zyi3/,eliminating_coasts,1579701292

1224,"&gt; So, slashing defense spending to concentrate on a welfare state, while letting the Americans pick up the bill, wasn't a ripoff? Huh. Weird.

When did that happen? Europe spends more on its military than China and Russia combined and has more soldiers than the US.

Most of the US bases at this point are still open because they have become transport hubs of the US for all the wars and military operations in Northern Africa and the Middle East.

https://theintercept.com/2015/04/17/ramstein/

&gt;Germany serves as the high-tech heart of Americas drone program. Ramstein is the site of a satellite relay station that enables drone operators in the American Southwest to communicate with their remote aircraft in Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan and other targeted countries.

&gt;[...]

&gt;Amid fierce European criticism of Americas targeted killing program, U.S. and German government officials have long downplayed Ramsteins role in lethal U.S. drone operations and have issued carefully phrased evasions when confronted with direct questions about the base. But the slides show that the facilities at Ramstein perform an essential function in lethal drone strikes conducted by the CIA and the U.S. military in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa.

&gt;[...]

&gt;The U.S. government maintains that its drone strikes against al Qaeda and its associated forces are legal, even outside of declared war zones. But German legal officials have suggested that such operations are only justifiable in actual war zones. Moreover, Germany has the right to prosecute criminal offenses against international law  even when the offense was committed abroad and bears no relation to Germany, according to Germanys Code of Crimes against International Law, which passed in 2002. Legal experts claimed that U.S. personnel could be charged as war criminals by German prosecutors.

&gt;[...]

&gt;In a 2010 budget request for the Ramstein satellite station, the U.S. Air Force asserted that without the Germany-based facility, the drone program could face significant degradation of operational capability that could have a serious impact on ongoing and future missions. Predator and Reaper drones, as well as Global Hawk aircraft, would use this site to conduct operations in Africa and the Middle East, according to the request. It stated bluntly that without the use of Ramstein, drone weapon strikes cannot be supported.

Why the fuck should Europe pay money for that? Lmao.

&gt;How about putting tariffs and non-tariff barriers to American products, while dumping everything you can make on the US market which is wide open? Not a ripoff. OK, moving on.

[The EU and US actually have almost the exactly same overall amount of tariffs on imports.](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/TM.TAX.MRCH.WM.AR.ZS?amp%3Bstart=2018&amp;amp;amp%3Bview=map&amp;amp;amp%3Byear=2017&amp;amp;amp%3Byear_high_desc=false&amp;amp;end=2018&amp;amp;most_recent_value_desc=false&amp;amp;view=map&amp;amp;year=2017) And [the US uses a lot more non-tariff barriers than the EU does.](https://i.imgur.com/pPUfNRt.png)

\&gt;Arseniko cheese, made for millennia on the island of Naxos, will soon be added to over 1,460 already protected food products from around the European Union. Its unique name¬†means ‚Äùmale‚Äù in Greek.

\&gt;This Naxos delicacy is a ripe, hard cheese traditionally made from unpasteurized goat‚Äôs milk.

\&gt;It stands out from other cheeses thanks to its intense, spicy and savory taste and it is produced and matured in various communities of Naxos as well as other small islets belonging to the Small Cyclades archipelago.

\&gt;The PGI distinction emphasizes the relationship between the specific geographic region and the name of the product, where a particular quality, reputation or other characteristic of a foodstuff is essentially attributable to its geographical origin.

\&gt;European consumers will now be able to see the characteristic red label on this cheese, and be completely sure that it is authentic ‚ÄùArseniko‚Äù cheese, produced on the island of¬†[Naxos,](https://greece.greekreporter.com/?s=Naxos) and not an imitation cheese made elsewhere.",,/r/europe/comments/esax1d/eu_adds_naxos_islands_arseniko_cheese_to/ff8sgt5/,Dygtig1,1579694334

Because it is Germany, the AfD is often compared to the Nazis and fascism, which is totally justified given some of their actions. Though, IMO UKIP displayed some of the same fascist populist tendencies but gets away with it easier without any Nazi comparisons.

As things stand today it's hard to judge. UKIP is basically gone but the Tories moved notably to the right.

Product: Gandalf‚Äôs Hat

Income 1 buya the product: 10/1000 = 1 % of monthly income

Income 2 buys the product 10/10000 = 0.1 % of monthly income

Most buyers of Gandalf‚Äôs Hat will belong to income 1, so this is a tax that will be financed by primarily income group 1, and the median tax rate will be closer to 1 % than 0.1 %.

1531,"Wow, Sinn Fein almost even with FG?

For those who don't follow Irish politics, here is my entirely partisan explanation of these parties:

Fine Gael: Right-wing Catholic party; sent a contingent to fight for Franco during the Spanish civil war; recently became socially liberal (brought us gay marriage and abortion) and is economically neoliberal and pro-business.

Fianna F√°il: Right-wing Catholic party; historically the only real difference between them and Fine Gael was that they were on opposite sides of the civil war, but in the 21st century they emerged as being more socially conservative and Catholic Church-friendly and economically centre than FG. Also unlike FG, they are synonymous with corruption and back-room deals. 

Sinn F√©in: Democratic Socialist and secularist, they're the only major party who officially are calling for separation of church and state. They also happen to be the former political front of the terrorist Irish Republican Army, but that's so long ago only the party elders were involved in all the murder and stuff so it's all dandy today...right?

Labour: A social-democratic party so moderate and out of touch with the workers they ostensibly represent that in the 1950's the CIA wasn't concerned about them being a threat. Their support collapsed when they joined a FG government and promptly abandoned all of their policies. 

Social Dems: Centre-left. Nordic style social democracy; new to the scene and unproven.

Solidarity-People Before Profit: An umbrella group of hard-to-far leftists, democratic socialists and pinkos, including some of our most colourful politicians.

Greens: Risen from the dead but in grave risk of all of their good policies being adopted by parties with actual bases they can mobilise - but if you're centre left, green and don't like Sinn Fein, they're a strong choice (they'd get my 4th preference vote for sure).",Ireland and USA,/r/europe/comments/ertdjf/ireland_election_pollffre_25_fgepp_23_6_sfleft_21/ff8cog0/,democritusparadise,1579673088

1589,"&gt; Oh yes, the Germans ""handed"" the independent capital of the Poles for Poland‚Äôs self-defense? Aren't you funny yourself? What the hell is Poland defending in the capital of Lithuania? I remind you that there was a war between Poland and Lithuania. According to the resolution of the Vilnius Seimas, formed by the elections of January 8, 1922, adopted on February 20, 1922, and the Act of Reunification of the Vilnius Region adopted by the Constituent Seimas in Warsaw on March 22, 1922, the Vilnius Territory unilaterally became part of Poland. (the real annexation)

Vilnius and Vilnius region was inhabited in majority by Polish people at that time. Lithuanians were in fact a tiny minority in the area. Their claims were based on historical rights, while Polish on the actual demographic of the country and the will of the people. Even Basanavicius, Lithuanian activists, said at Great Seimas in Vilnius that if the ceiling of the hall they were in collapse, all Lithuanians in Vilnius would die. Lithuanian army wasn't yet formed, especially in Vilnius, where simply wasn't enough volunteers to join their ranks, but Polish self-defence (since December 1918 formally part of Polish army) was well organised. In fear that Germans were going to hand over city to Bolsheviks Polish self-defence demanded from them control of the city, after some quarrels, Germans decided to do it and evacuated the city with the New Year of 1919. With them also most Lithuanians activists left the city.

But the real question is what the fuck were Russian Bolsheviks doing there? The fate of the city was the matter between Poles, Belarusian, Jews and Lithuanians living there, not Russians. As far as I know Russia starts around Smole≈Ñsk not in central Europe.

&gt; The same can be said about the Riga Treaty. It was a necessary measure

It was the official peace treaty signed by official government of Soviet Union. You cannot sign one thing and then break it after some time. It is not like they were forced to sign it, it wasn't in any way comparable to Brest-Litvosk, there was a truce already and signing peace wasn't required if they didn't accept the border. Poland wasn't able to push further. And you probably does not know that but Soviet Union was going to give away entire Belarus with Minsk to Poland, they were insisting on that, so it looks like they really didn't care much about this territories. 

Just face it. Soviet Union signed deliberately treaty with Poland, non-agression pact with Poland, Litvinov Protocol with Poland and after that broke all these agreements in 1939. This is called treachery. 

&gt; Dude, I don‚Äôt even know what to tell you. Open the map and see which country these territories are in. Is it Poland? 

Yes dude Bia≈Çystok, Podlasie and Mazovia are in fact in Poland, I would say even that closer to center than to eastern border. [Just look on the map](https://www.tysol.pl/zdj/zdjecie/7333) and see where Bia≈Çystok is. It is literally [capital of Podlaskie Voivodeship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bia%C5%82ystok) in today's Poland. That is big factual fallacy on your side.

Let me remind you that fights started earlier with Soviet offensive on the west in late 1918, Soviets attacked Polish troops in Vilnius in January 1919. And we didn't capture the city but it was handed over by retreating German troops to Polish self-defence. Also Brest was part of historical Belarus, not Ukraine and before the war was Polosh-Jewish town.

Peace of Riga was a failure of Pi≈Çsudski policy, although Polish counter offensive on Vistula and Nieman was successful, Bolshevik forces weren't crushed and Poland wasn't able to force them retreat from Ukraine and Belarus. We were also exhausted by constant fighting. 

Bolshevik Russia resigned from any claims to these lands thrice - in Brest Litvosk 1918, by recognizing partition treaties as illegal and in Riga 1921. Later confirmed several times inviolability of Polish-Soviet border: ie in non-aggresion pact, in Litvinov Protocol and so on. Soviet Union had no right to enter Polish territory.

Also it's not right that Soviet Union annexed only Belarusian and Ukrainian territories, because they annexed also Bialystok, Podlasie and eastern Mazovia, indisputable ethnic Polish lands.

‚ÄûResearch by Bloomberg Economics estimates that the economic cost of Brexit has already hit 130 billion pounds‚Äú

‚Äûwith a further 70 billion pounds set to be added by the end of this year‚Äú

‚ÄûThat‚Äôs based on the damage caused by the U.K. untethering from its Group of Seven peers over the past three years.‚Äú

‚ÄûThere is a strong historic correlation between the U.K. and G-7 countries. But they have been diverging since the vote to leave the EU, with the British economy now 3% smaller than it could have been had the relationship been maintained.‚Äú

‚Äû(...)the uncertainty since the 2016 referendum has taken a toll. Business investment in particular has been held back, and annualized economic growth has halved to 1% from 2%.‚Äú


‚ÄûDan Hanson, U.K. economist for Bloomberg Economics, puts the total cost of Brexit by the end of 2020 at 200 billion pounds as uncertainty continues to take a toll on companies and consumers.‚Äú

‚ÄûDespite this, none of the ground lost since 2016 is likely to be made up, according to Hanson.

‚ÄúLooking beyond 2020, we forecast the growth spurt in this year will be a one off -- the economy will get a shot in the arm, but the cyclical lift that provides won‚Äôt last,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAs the U.K. comes to terms with its new trading relationship with the EU and grapples with the productivity challenge that has hindered growth since the financial crisis, the annual cost of Brexit is likely to keep increasing.‚Äù‚Äú

1732,"While Prince Harry was making a speech on Sunday night, Himself was in a London cab. The driver was incensed by reports suggesting the Duke and Duchess were abdicating because Meghan had been the victim of racist media coverage. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even know she was black until I saw her mum at the wedding,‚Äù huffed the cabbie.

He spoke for millions of Britons who welcomed the beautiful American actress into our Royal family with open arms and had no concerns about her suitability. Well, not until she started writing cringeworthy mottos on bananas destined for sex workers, anyway.

On Question Time, when the actor Laurence Fox also dismissed the suggestion that Meghan had faced racism and said that, as countries go, we were really quite nice and non-racist, there was uproar in the ‚Äòwoke‚Äô echo chamber of social media. The rest of the country simply nodded and said: ‚ÄúToo right, mate.‚Äù

An audience member (naturally, she turned out to be an academic and regular BBC contributor) then accused Fox of ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù. That charge is supposed to intimidate its target into silence. Refreshingly, Fox refused to be cowed. He pointed out that nervousness surrounding the issue of racism meant that ‚Äúthings like the Manchester grooming scandal get ignored‚Äù.

How painfully true that was. In the very week that an excoriating 150-page report revealed that Greater Manchester Police (GMP) knew of grooming gangs sexually exploiting almost a hundred girls, some as young as 12, ‚Äúin plain sight‚Äù, Question Time did not feature a single question on the topic.

The BBC was keen to indulge the notion that a cossetted multi-millionairess had been a victim of racism, while completely ignoring girls like Victoria Agoglia, who died after having her 15-year-old veins filled with heroin so she could be raped by dozens of ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù (Pakistani-heritage) men.

I ask you, which case is of greater national significance? A duchess who leaves the Royal family after 20 months because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot working for me‚Äù, or the revelation that police officers turned a blind eye to scores of children being grotesquely violated because to arrest their tormentors might look like cultural insensitivity?


Not much ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù for poor Victoria Agoglia, whose grandmother begged in vain for police and social services to help her. Nor for the 11-year-old in Oxford whose buttock was branded with the initial of her British-Pakistani ‚Äúowner‚Äù. On the contrary. The girls being white, and their abusers being non-white, made it much less likely they would be protected.

At long last, we now have conclusive proof of that. After a five-year investigation, the Independent Office for Police Conduct has just upheld a complaint against a senior Rotherham officer who admitted that his force ignored the sexual abuse of girls by grooming gangs ‚Äúfor decades‚Äù because it was afraid of increasing ‚Äúracial tensions‚Äù.

The copper, who was unable to be identified, told a missing child‚Äôs distraught father that grooming was ‚ÄúP----s----ing‚Äù, and admitted that ‚Äúwhat with it being Asians, we can‚Äôt afford for this to be coming out‚Äù, because the town ‚Äúwould erupt‚Äù.

Keeping the lid on social unrest, not upsetting ‚Äúthe community‚Äù, that was the main thing. Young girls pimped, threatened, tortured? Why, they were just collateral damage in the greater project of multiculturalism.

After Victoria Agoglia died of an overdose administered by an older man in 2003, official denial became a lot harder ‚Äì although that didn‚Äôt stop the coroner at Victoria‚Äôs inquest doing his best. He ‚Äúrecognised the multiple concerns‚Äù, but pointed out that the girl had a ‚Äúpropensity to provide sexual favours‚Äù. Remember that insensitive man was talking about a child who was supposedly in the care of Manchester City Council when she was coerced, before puberty, into prostitution.


GMP set up Operation Augusta to tackle ‚Äúthe sexual exploitation of a significant number of children in the care system by predominantly Asian men‚Äù. Police identified at least 57 child victims and up to 97 suspects. But Augusta was abruptly closed down after just over a year when police turned to less ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù crimes. The report claims there was a lack of resources, but the amazing Maggie Oliver, the retired detective who blew the whistle, said that not only had GMP ‚Äúdeliberately‚Äù not investigated child rape, it had tried to get the official report suppressed.

You may have noticed that I find it extremely hard to write about the despicable behaviour ‚Äì both by the perpetrators and by the people who were supposed to protect their young prey ‚Äì without completely losing it. So, just to recap: 27 towns and cities so far where grooming gangs, made up of predominantly Pakistani-heritage males, have plied their foul trade.

Last year, the NSPCC identified 19,000 victims of gang abuse and admitted the true number is probably much higher. It is, without doubt, the biggest scandal this country has seen in my lifetime, yet still there is a terror on the part of officialdom of conducting the full public inquiry that is so clearly needed.

Back in December 2018, Sajid Javid, then home secretary, said that it was ‚Äúwrong to ignore‚Äù the ethnicity of abusers. Born in Rochdale to a British-Pakistani family, Javid was ideally placed to insist that he wanted officials researching the causes of gang-based exploitation to ‚Äúleave no stone unturned‚Äù.


Even Javid, after he spoke out, was asked by a Muslim writer if he worried that his comments ‚Äúmay have fuelled hate crimes‚Äù. Thus do perpetrators continue to evade justice because exposing the hateful things men from that background have done to young girls might cause, yes, ‚Äúhate crimes‚Äù. Damned if you do, damned if you don‚Äôt.

Consider the fate of that Home Office report into grooming gangs commissioned by Javid. Now complete, officials are refusing to make it public. Why? 

We are often told that this is a complex issue. I think it‚Äôs horribly simple, actually. As Shaista Gohir of the Muslim Women‚Äôs Network told Newsnight last week: ‚ÄúPakistan is one of the worst countries in the world to be a woman.‚Äù If you import Pakistan‚Äôs misogynistic attitudes into parts of the UK and they run straight into vulnerable young white girls who look, to a certain type of man, like easy meat, then you have a recipe for sexual abuse.

Furthermore, if your authorities are afraid to confront and condemn those misogynistic attitudes for fear of appearing racist, then that sexual abuse can flourish on an industrial scale.

I agree with Maggie Oliver. After the scathing report into GMP was published, she demanded that criminal prosecutions be brought against those at the top of the police. Let the guilty men be named and shamed for leaving so many terrified girls at the mercy of their abusers. Meanwhile, hundreds of victims are suing seven councils and South Yorkshire Police for their part in the Rotherham scandal. Good for them.


But a scandal of this magnitude calls for remedy at the highest level. Priti Patel has got off to a terrific start, fierce and focused, as Home Secretary. I hope she will call on her considerable reserves of political courage, publish the report into the grooming gangs and announce a public inquiry to put a stop to this toxic epidemic once and for all.

Even if we entertain the idea of it, we can see that it will never work in practice. Say EU puts 10% carbon tax on a certain good that it imports.

Congratulations inside EU the price of that good has risen by 10%. The country they were importing from will simply raise the price of the said good and EU consumers will end up paying the 10% EU imposed.

No other companies nor countries will adopt EU standards on emission from which the EU imports stuff, it would be suicide for them. And it will be still cheaper to import such things from poor countries who don't follow EU standards than to make it inside EU. 

Say EU introduces carbon tax on steel from country A. Country A will simply respond by increasing the price of steel by the amount of carbon tax EU chose to apply. Because it costs them nothing to do so while limiting emissions is too expensive for them.  You might say ""well EU would choose another country"". Yeah which one ? Country B, C, D, E, F, G, H... and the rest that produce steel also do not follow EU rules and regulations on carbon emissions.  And they won't start following it either because for them it's the same situation as for country A. Limiting emissions would be too expensive for them. And EU will continue buying from them with that increased price because even with 10% higher prices it's still cheaper than making it in the EU. The only one who would lose from this tax is EU citizens/companies themselves. 

This would only work in a world in which EU hold enough power to FORCE (it wouldn't work any other way, asking nicely won't get it done) their emission standards on other countries. And they don't.

1976,"Hey there!
Brexit essentially has a cost in leaving a trade union, that being the EU. No one as of right now knows what the cost will be, as no new trade deal had been agreed upon between the EU and GB. A trade deal might include fishing rights ( think between France and Britain, the English Channel), tariffs (taxes products coming into your country, the EU protects its agricultural goods greatly) and others things like how foreign companies can/may operate in the host country.

The picture here is an estimation, but it‚Äôs important to remember that‚Äôs it‚Äôs just an educated guess.
Brexit has larger implications to, being that GB is the first country (and a major one at that) to leave (and it will leave, as past voting shows).
What it seems to me, is that those supporting Brexit are concerned about Britain sovereignty, of over regulation from Brussels, the lack of clear representation in Brussels.
Those on the others side (pro Eu) point out the benefits of the Eu, freedom of movement (Schwengen), common currency, and a stronger presence on the world stage, between the US and China. They also point to xenophobia of Brexiters. In their defense this comes back to the sovereignty problem, as not all immigrants are equal in education, work ethic, and assimilation. A sleight of hand used is to used is to show the benefits of highly educated/skilled europeans who share (in general) the same values as British folk, and ignore other immigrants from africa/Middle East who may not share the same values of native Britain. creating tension in the community.
Not to mention the Scottish independence movement, and the N. Irish/ Irish tension that will come from the loss of schwengen. (Remember the IRA and Good Friday Agreement?)

All in all I can sympathize with the Europeans . Being an American my nation suffered from its own civil war. The focal point being slavery, with broader implications of ‚ÄúDo States have the right to leave the Union?‚Äù. The answer is no, and other questions were settled. I think people may forget that Britain has its own commonwealth, and cultural have closer ties with Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the US.

1992,"As I said, it's not that this isn't a problem. It is a problem. I was pointing out that the problem isn't specific to this government, it's systemic in Hungarian politics. Honestly, I know it was a long time ago but the previous government was corrupt as hell. Just like this one. If you can't recall anything major, just have a look at newspapers from back then. Preferably not those owned by lackies. 

The Hungarian public was in a state of apathy from 2006 and then the economic crisis hit us hard. Whatever could be moved was stolen. 'Sold at outrageously low prices' I mean. Valueless land traded 1:1 with high value parcels, same EU money thefts, government tenders sold to friends, blackmail and extortion from regional governors, drug scandals, blackmailing, mafia connections, it's hard to miss. And nobody ever resigned. Except for the PM who got better off this way. I know I didn't really care because I couldn't imagine it being any better. And I was super busy clinging to my minimum wage job I needed to finish university.

They move production to EEU because they automated what is there to automate in local factories, but the greater part of production that isn't as stable and needs frequent changes is still done by humans or human controlled machines. And that is cheaper to be done in EEU. They don't give a single flying fuck about their local society, they leave management there, and that's about it. In EEU now you have immigrants from better off counties, like Portugal, Spain, France, Italy even Germany sometimes, because it's easier to get a job here for them, and they still get decent quality of life.

Companies wouldn't pay you more for lowest paid jobs. They would move somewhere else. It's not a problem to move programing, development, design, engineering etc, all of the ""thinking"" jobs to other country.

2064,"&gt;I may be travelling ""wrong"", but regardless if I'm gone for more than a week I have checked luggage (I don't know about your hygiene standards (jk)), which is every time I go on vacation. Which is where I assume this debate is the most fruitful.

Go to r/onebag to check the efficient way of packing.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are in the air 1h30 min it means that's it's 1h50 of  scheduled flight time (10 min + 10 min taxing). Add 40 minutes for check-in luggage. So minimum is 2.5h. 

The rest depends on a particular trip and whether you live closer to the airport or closer to the train station. 

If you live in Germany it might be better to take a train to Paris  than fly to CDG as navigating the airport and getting from there takes forever. 

But if you go to Prague? To exit the airport takes literally 2 minutes and the drive to city center is 20-25 minutes.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/err85c/brusselsvienna_night_train_returns_as_europe_eyes/ff6wlo1/,Roqitt,1579636385

About nuclear in France, I think this article doesn't really teach us anything new. A law was passed in 2015 to reduce the share of nuclear in our electricity production so we will have to close some power plant. They just announced which ones will be closed. 

It's really dumb beceause thoses plant will close even if our nuclear agency (ASN) say they can still run without any issue

But I don't think that mean we will abandon nuclear electricity. Or at least I think the decision isn't made yet (the Government also asked EDF to make plans for 6 new EPR).

IMO it will comes down to 2 things :

Flexibility is a mean, not and end. Same way that medicine is a mean, not and end, or that telephones are a mean, not and end. This is a silly point.


Flexible systems are better because they allow people to switch jobs more easily and make the labor market more flexible.

My point isn't that it will never work. My point is that regular high speed rail will mostly accomplish exactly the same goals as Maglev while being a more mature technology. Ignoring high speed rail and investing in Maglev is like having cars, but underusing them and trying to make flying cars available.

[Here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297471032_An_Evaluation_of_Maglev_Technology_and_Its_Comparison_With_High_Speed_Rail) is a technical comparison of conventional high speed rail and Maglev if you want to read it.

This excpert is from their conclusions.

&gt;Most Maglev reports, in Germany and
USA, include only superficial comparisons
with high speed rail, and those comparisons
are largely deceptive: Maglev is compared
with existing or upgraded railroads, rather
than with new high speed rail systems which
would be the closest alternative to the pro-
posed Maglev. Further, most benefits listed in
support of the Maglev, such as the need for
high-capacity, high-speed systems, reduction
of highway congestion, environmental bene-
fits, and others, are actually those valid for
any high speed ground transportation: they
are technology-neutral. The fact that most of
these benefits could be achieved by high
speed rail also, is not mentioned.
While both the German and Japanese
Maglev system feasibility has been demon-
strated, neither superiority nor equivalence
of this technology with high speed rail has
been proven. Disadvantages of Maglev in

The UK is one of the most diverse parts of Europe and London one of the most diverse cities in the world. I'm not sure what you mean by gatekeeping people who may be less predisposed to be victims of racism, when the largest immigrant groups to the UK before 2000 were from India, Pakistan and  the Caribbean communities. 

The truth is people like to paint the UK as exceptionally xenophobic for a European country, primarily because immigration was a big part of Brexit. However, research of the type posted to r/Europe every so often consistently shows other parts of Europe to have more of an issue with people not of their race than the UK. Lets not pretend Turkey doesn't have problems either.  

I doubt there is any country where racism isn't a problem, but for other Europeans on this sub to constantly point the finger at the UK whilst ignoring, denying, or obfuscating their own issues is incredibly hypocritical.

Whilst statistics and research can be used to build a narrative, they are the best way of assessing a particular situation - certainly more so that opinions or anecdote.

it is one (1) example which you use to assert that renewables ""essentially useless and really expensive"".

&gt; you are just ignoring the fact that nuclear energy cost less than renewable energy

again, in this one specific case. i don't understand what there is to defend here, unless you can find more actual examples instead of articles on the same example it's not going to make for a convincing argument. that's like saying audis are 50x less safe than VWs because of several reports about the same mass crash that involved 50 audis and one VW

&gt; BTW even a german minister admitted that building renewbles will cost more than nuclear :

you don't have to add ""BTW"" to this since i've referenced this exact article already, and i'm starting to doubt that you've read it. the article is about how the buildup *would* cost 1000 billion euros and that they are putting a ""brake"" in place that will reduce the tariff on new plants from 1.8 billion to 1 billion or less per year. but none of this actually matters because of the fact that whatever germany pays in practice doesn't automatically say anything about how much it costs in general. this is what i've been trying to say this whole time and that's why i wouldn't regard your claims unless you can bring up more than this one example.",looks like ukraine but isn't,/r/europe/comments/eribi6/eu_invests_1_trillion_to_make_its_economy_more/ff5re2c/,HbmMods,1579607270

That's what it used to do -- it used to just coordinate the existing national ones.  But it's been moved from that limited coordination role, hence the ongoing and future scale-up.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Border_and_Coast_Guard_Agency

&gt; Frontex was established in 2004 as the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders and is primarily responsible for coordinating border control efforts. In response to the European migrant crisis of 2015‚Äì2016, the European Commission proposed on 15 December 2015 to extend Frontex's mandate and to transform it into a fully-fledged European Border and Coast Guard Agency.[6] On 18 December 2015, the European Council roundly supported the proposal,[7] and after a vote by the European Parliament, the European Border and Coast Guard was officially launched on 6 October 2016 at the Bulgarian external border with Turkey.[8]

As a 10,000-man agency, they won't be doing just coordinating work.

I mean, I don't expect any country to simply disband their border people in the immediate future, but unless the EU is going to just have a lot more border control capability than it has had, it's gotta displace the existing agencies to some degree.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ern848/thousands_apply_for_eu_border_guard_posts/ff5rn0i/,duisThias,1579607568

2522,"&gt; Dissolving the most successful alliance the West has ever had to placate your former enemy is nothing but appeasement. My choice of words is accurate.

Well, if you find that having stability is less important than having this alliance, feel free in doing so.

I think, it would have been better to do a ""new start"". NATO could have been developed again either way if Russia started doing things. And since developing a new NATO wouldn't have been in Russia's strategic interest, they wouldn't have done stuff and there would be a big incentive to play nice. In the past however, when Russia played nice, their geopolitical security was ignored.

&gt; ""If only we did X, Russia would hate us less.""

It's rather ""If only we did X, Russia would not regard that as such a security threat that they preferred the diplomatic sanctions over having bad security"".


&gt; That's bullshit, sorry. Russia is what it is mainly because the Russians want it like that. Not all, perhaps not even a majority, but enough of them to keep people like Putin in power.

The Poles made a choice to reform their economy and society according to Western models and integrate with Europe and succeeded spectacularly (perhaps too much for their own good). Russians chose to enact a series of half-assed economic reforms which changed the former Communist apparatchiks into oligarchs and instead of aligning with the West (they could easily have joined NATO if they chose the same path as the Poles), 

Not sure how that matters in in this topic. Poland grew faster, mainly because of the access to the EU market. 

Also, those half-assed reforms were made by Yeltsin, who was advised by the US. So yeah, the Western model didn't work out apparently.

&gt; Yet Germany and others still play with this idiotic appeasement notion that perhaps if we give Putin what he says he wants, he'll leave us alone. He won't. The more you kowtow to him, the more he'll ask for. So stop this nonsense.

Again, you fail to read. I'm not talking about not doing anything now. I'm talking what could have been done differently so that there wouldn't be such a situation.

B) Claims to sovereignty and their legality. As stipulated after Nuremberg, winning a war does not satisfy the conditions for annexation. 

To which body for which the population domestic to the lands of Israel / Palestine should take their grievances. Never is the issue of being denied representation both internally in the entity which lays claim to the lands, nor where externally such grievances would be adressed.

It is an indisputable fact that millions of palestinians inhabit the levant and that they are at every turn being denied the ability to represent their cause.

2725,"There is a persistent and pervasive cultural norm of tax evasion, favoritism, having 'backup' off-the-record money, knowing the right people in the state, and so on...

This probably stems from the time of the Ottomans or even earlier. And it developed because people had to lookout extra for themselves and their families, keep some 'backup', bribe some Ottoman officials, etc.

This mindset never faded, as we were pulled into modernity by western powers, instead of naturally evolving in it. We never had a Renaissance.

We are at a point now where it's like a prisoners dilemma in game theory. If no one plays, we all win. But people are individually highly incentivized to 'play' and thus it's very difficult to stop. 

To be honest I think the only way to truly change is to have a heavily controlling totalitarian state. But that would take us waay back economically anyway so it is pointless.

This is true for most Balkan countries, not just Greece, by the way.

We are talking about hypotheticals.

&gt; The 3 baltic countries were fully part of the USSR. There are still sizeable russian minorities in Estonia and Latvia, especially the latter. 

So? Their situation is still very different.


&gt; I also believe it is very likely that Russia might have tried something without NATO.

Why though? If we look at Russia's behavior it was only aggressive towards countries which wanted to join NATO. If what you wrote would be plausible, than Russia would have attacked a long time ago, since they aren't in NATO, even when the USSR was around.

&gt; Invading an unaligned Estonia or Latvia would also have been much easier than than the current Ukrainian operation.

What do you mean? Russia merely supports rebels in Ukraine, it's not an invasion.

Otherwise, one would hire into the EBCG and then need to lay people off at a national level and just lose their experience.

To choose a random large-country force, it looks like the [UK has 7500 people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Force) dealing with border/coast control, so I figure that the target in a few years of 10,000 is about on scale with that of one of the major EU members; that seems like a lot of redundancy if they're not gonna pull from the existing agencies.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ern848/thousands_apply_for_eu_border_guard_posts/ff4vd7v/,duisThias,1579573339

3165,"As a monopoly, this is a regulated market, which means that the government essentially sets the rates through a rate hike cap. Following the electricity breaks caused by the named storms Hannu and Tapani in 2011, the Katainen government decided that they'll legally require the network companies to dig the cables underground, so that they can't be knocked down by falling trees - even in sparsely populated areas. This refurbishment is hilariously expensive. Accordingly, network companies have been passing this cost down to their clients. The main reason for these particularly high rate hikes hasn't even been as much the cost, but the way too optimistic refurbishment schedule set by the government.

The Marin government is now backtracking and setting a lower rate hike cap and allowing for a longer period for the refurbishment. The target date will be pushed back to 2036 from the previous 2028, which is gives substantial relief. Also, the government will double the period for which network operators will be allowed to compensate the loss accrued over unprofitable years. This will allow them to lower prices to a more stable level as well. They don't have to hurriedly recoup losses in one unprofitable period by a really high price over the next profitable period.

3340,"&gt;BELGRADE -- In the last three years, research by Faktor Plus shows that support of Serbian citizens for joining EU has been declining, Blic reports.

&gt;It is explained that Brexit, French President Emmanuel Macron, who said he was not in favor of enlargement, along with the Kosovo issue, had contributed to the decrease of the support for EU membership.

&gt;The newspaper reports that in 2019, 38 per cent of respondents thought we should not enter the EU, only 35 per cent were in favor of it, and as many as 27 per cent did not have an opinion.

&gt;Political turbulences in Europe, a burning issue of Kosovo and Metohija or something else, nevertheless, the interest of Serbian citizens for EU accession has been declining for a decade, and for the last three years it has been at its lowest since the 1990s, Blic notes.

&gt;Faktor Plus Agency Director Vladimir Pejic says that the greatest interest in joining the European Union existed from 2000 to 2005, and that the first decline in confidence came from the secession of Montenegro and then in 2008 with the declaration of Kosovo's independence, which greatly affected the EU's worsening rating in our country.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/ergofa/worrying_data_but_for_whom_serbia_or_the_eu/ff3jxha/,lukalux3,1579542634

3426,"&gt;Having the biggest minority does not give you a mayority.

IT GIVES YOU THE BIGGEST MANDATE YOU CAN GET. OTHERS DON'T EVEN HAVE A MANDATE. GET IT THROUGH YOUR SCALP PLEASE.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No, that's how elective oligarchy works, where you chose the most popular oligarch, demo(people) cracy(rule) does not mean the minority rules, quite the opposite.

If other candidates won, they would be in an even SMALLER minority. So your argument is total bullshit, because it doesn't work in any other alternative reality.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Swiss model for one, it's right next door, no constant strikes or protests either.

Wow, so you think that Switzerland model would somehow miraculously solve the stalemate situation that France constantly finds itself in? Sorry to tell you but it wouldn't. Never. Because you can do whatever you want, there will always be a majority disapproving the minority in such situation as there are roughly 4 incompatible ideologies of around 25% support accross the whole country that disaprove each other. No matter what model you use, no matter how large and how many constituencies you divide the country into. If you want to remain a republic, federation or confederation, there will always have to be the highest ruling body above all, otherwise the system wouldn't work, under any circumstances.

You think Switzerland is somehow immune to such scenarios? You obviously don't understand the hierarchy of the Swiss political system then.

For example, in France the dispute currently concerns the reforms of pension system. It divides the country no matter who is in power, because there will always be a majority that disapproves the ruling ""minority"". The same situation can emerge in Switzerland in any time, considering that a federal-level issue is not resolved in a similar way that happens in France (e. g. foreign relations),

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Welcome to Belgium. Society does not collapse.

Who mentioned collapsing? It's stagnating and that's enough to damage everybody's interest.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If they truly were a minority they would not receive public support for so long, would they?

What does continuous support have to do with minority/majority? Wtf are you talking about? A minority of 1% can have neverending support... 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The people are the ones who give the mandate, not the politicians. 

Wow, that's news? And what are you trying to say by this? Macron has the biggest mandate from all candidates, so what can you furhter say about this? That Melenchon should win? And why? Would he have a more relevant mandate? Wtf is wrong with your logic?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Again. Switzerland. No protests, no blockage. 

Wow, there are like hundred other countries that have no protests and no blockages. Surprised pikachu? Maybe the reason is somewhere else?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Wich is not a candidate with 24% of the votes... 

Yeah? You don't say. And who is? The ones who got LESSER votes, right?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No, did I mention their system is broken? I'm very sure i did.

Blalablablabla broken system blablablablabla broken system blablablabla. That's exactly your excuse for people rioting and damaging others' property. That's again ridiculously stupid excuse. You think that in other countries systems are not ""broken""? And what exactly is that you don't like about the system that you consider it ""broken""?

Your reasoning is similar to a 10 years old spolied kid that doesn't stop crying until it gets what it wants, no matter the expense. You can't accept that your preference can't get even so many votes than ""the minority"".

3517,"&gt;It looks like shit, but nothing can be done about it.

Things can absolutely be done about it. It's not only the investors that are the problem, it's also inefficient city planning that doesn't allow inefficient buildings to be demolished due to NIMBYism.

The investors invest because they can build something more efficient on the lots. Say 5 home building can be turned into a 20 home building of similar size. The current buildings on the lots are actually worthless liabilities, even if they were in prime condition. 
Most investors will try rent out the apartments under the market rate during the time before demolishing, but it doesn't make economic sense for all properties since some need repairs to be made legal rentals.

However, NIMBYism can extend this process. and that's why some properties end up standing empty for long.

The Vancouver tax on empty investment properties works, but it does not solve the underlying problem. Releasing 5 unused homes on the market helps, but if the market prices rent as if the lot should have 20 homes, the rents stay high to renters and the investor still doesn't get a very good return on his investment.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/erc9yx/house_prices_and_rents_in_eu_between_2007_and/ff2xvle/,RassyM,1579528108

3532,"&gt;Second, I know France's social system fairly well. It was one of my topics (among others) in several of my research papers and my final thesis. So I certainly wouldn't say I have ""no idea"" how is it. I wouldn't call it ""broken"" because somebody doesn't like it. France's social system is undoubtedly very generous (compared to other social systems in Europe and world).
&gt;

A social system and political system is not the same thing. 

&gt;He said that he ""only won 24%"", implying he doesn't have a mandate to push for this policy. That's total bullshit, because he won the most votes, on the first and then the second round as well. **He has the only relevant mandat**e in France to introduce reforms.
&gt;

So 76% did NOT vote for him, he does NOT represent the mayority of the people. 

Before macron there was relative calm, few protests and few strikes. Now, with macron, there has been near constant protests and many strikes, most are demanding macron resigns. 

Keep in mind this is not just about retirement, it is about tax reductions for the wealthy on one side, and austerity and lower pensions on the other. This are not isolated events. 

Dispite people generally not liking strikes and protests, there is great support for them, even lawyers are resorting to protests and strikes, this is a clear Indication people do not want this system. 

&gt;He was mentioning democracy, so I am reminding him that this **is** democracy and this is how democracy works. Don't like it? Go cry somewhere else, but don't say it is undemocratic, because that's a total bullshit.
&gt;
&gt;BTW, if their system is really broken, it's certainly not Macron who broke it. The roots of the system are somewhere in the past when Macron wasn't even born. And whoever will try to fix it will be met with protests and strikes because there will be always a part of population that won't like it and every party has a quite different view on it.

When you use a broken system, you can't claim pushing your agenda is democratic. Even if you did not break the system yourself, you are still using the broken system, also note he does not attempt to fix the system either, he's quite happy to use a broken system to his advantage.

When a system is broken like this, and the people feel they are not represented, you get protests.

When those protests still do not result in representation, it escalates and you get violence.

When this violence does not result in representation, it escalates further..",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/eqx755/emmanuel_macron_rushed_out_of_paris_theatre_after/ff2y21t/,thenewsheogorath,1579528271

3593,"I love taking night trains and wish there were more, but I think at least in their current form they're really no alternative to flying. It's not even just the price. Depending on where you going, it might be actually be cheaper than a flight, for example Munich - Venice one way in a couchette is 70‚Ç¨ (and you have the accomodation for one night and one breakfast included), which is a very competetive price.

But I've taken 10 night trains so far and I've seriously never been on one that arrived on time. 20 minutes late was the earliest I've arrived, 30 min- 1h seems to be the norm and I've had 3 that were more than 3 hours late. (That said, most of those train rides were to Eastern/Southern Europe, where trains are less regular in general in my experience). It doesn't really bother me bc I use them for recreational travel, but it's not something I'd risk if I had an important appointment/business meeting. The washrooms often aren't great either, as a travelling student I don't mind getting ready there or at the public bathroom of the arrival train station, but if I had to look well-groomed and professional, I think it would be more compliated.

If your train is very late it also often doesn't go to its scheduled destination, but rather stops somewhere along the way and you have to go the rest of the way by regional train (they do change your ticket and tell you roughly where to go, but you're still pretty much on your own, it's hectic, it's often still quite early in the morning and generally a hassle).

Plus, passport controls can happen in the middle of the night, even within Schengen, for example at the German/Austrian border. This really depends on your route, but if you go through multiple countries it can very well happen that you're woken up multiple times to show your passport.

Night train travel also isn't for everyone - some people have trouble sleeping in moving trains, especially sharing a small mixed-sex compartment with total strangers as is the norm in couchettes, if you're very tall or have back problems the cots are not exactly comfortable, plus if you have mobility problems, you might have trouble getting into the upper cots. I also wouldn't advise to travel this way if you have small children as I imagine it's super stressful both for you and the other passengers. A lot of luggage is also not ideal, the compartments are very small.

So while I love train travel personally for my holidays, in most situation it's not in direct competition with flying.",,/r/europe/comments/er3ath/is_flightshaming_helping_resurrect_europes/ff2yo4h/,montanunion,1579528822

-

&gt;At the end of the day, however, when push comes to shove and a conflict is imminent, these rules will suddenly get a lot more flexible as member states will attempt to interpret them in their favor. The only real way to find out is to test it, but with any luck we never have to.

Sure, you won't shut down a nuclear plant like you do with a gas plant, but in a scenario where you go for nuclear + renewables, a NPP will typically operate at roughly 80% rated power, and load follow daily(not weeks in advance as you claim) by increasing or decreasing output depending on the renewable generation.",,/r/europe/comments/eo3goy/austrian_green_mep_gas_is_a_better_transition/ff2iunn/,dyyret,1579508079

3937,"&gt; Not sure what relevans this has to this particular post about North Rhine-westphalia and why its economy is bigger than that of Denmark. A quick Internet search revealed it was not larger pr capita.

The relevance was that you came across as complaining that the map as useless because it wasn't adjusted for population or any number of other factors. That combined with your mention of Denmark made it look that you were sore that your country wasn't above the threshold. GDP per capita is also an interesting thing to look at, don't get me wrong, but I take umbrage to the idea that GDP is meaningless. Quantity can often have a quality all its own.

&gt; Of course it is true that larger economies often excerts more power or influence than smaller economies, but again comparing for instance the soft power index listings of the 5 nordic nations with a total population action of less than 27 million, they influence a lot more than far more populous nations with higher gdp's. An example from this week being Sweden getting noticed by China and India asking Denmark for assistance.

Uh... how is getting noticed by China an instance of influence? Let alone considering that as more influential than larger countries? Influence to me is when one country plays a role in the decision-making of another or otherwise has some sort of leverage. Sweden doesn't really have that sort of power on China, it has had some of its citizens kidnapped and detained over there such as Gui Minhai. His daughter was campaigning for his release, then the Swedish diplomat Lindstedt tried to pull some shady business to negotiate that ended up trapping her in a hotel with a bunch of CPC goons trying to threaten her into shutting up, taking a visa and a job at the Chinese embassy. It didn't pan out and the whole deal got reported to the media, but that doesn't speak of influence to me.

&gt; Just ask yourself one simple question. How many famous Chinese authors can European kids name, and then ask Chinese kids if they can name a European one. Smaller developed nations influence how more poorer populous nations evolve. That we can agree on. But again. What in my comments so far made you argue differently?

See, you're not really doing like with like here. You're roping in an entire continent up against China and not, say, Denmark alone, which doesn't go to demonstrate how influential the one small country is. I really do suspect that Danish kids could probably rattle off at least Confucius, Mencius and Sun Tzu from being a conscious person with some schooling. If they enjoy anything related to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms then bam, Luo Guanzhong. Leave aside that several well-known Chinese leaders of the past century that anyone can name who have been authors (most infamously Mao and his little red book). Whereas with Denmark you get, what, Hans Christian Andersen and Kierkegaard before you have a steep decline into obscurity? I don't know what the penetration is of western fairytales and philosophy is among Chinese kids, if it's not great then maybe not even them. Let's not even venture into the exercise of naming Chinese vs. Danish companies which I would say is probably more impactful than recognizing foreign authors.",Mississippi,/r/europe/comments/eqzton/countries_with_a_smaller_gdp_than_north/ff2cui6/,sparkling_uranium,1579501042

3949,"The mainstream Western press has reported on Russia in a relatively uniform manner over the past four to five years or so. It generally follows the theme of referring to Putin as a ruthless dictator with his eyes set on the former Soviet territories and beyond, while his populace secretly hates him but is afraid to show it for fear of getting assassinated like his other political rivals. Now to me, this is laughable and not substantiated by any evidence. And with regards to geopolitics‚Äîother than Crimea‚Äîwhat other territories are referring to? 

I can understand Ukraine not being happy about Crimea, but Russia by no means just conquered that land. It's a historically Russian region in which the overwhelming majority of people speak Russia and consider themselves Russians. They held a referendum and voted to secede and join Russia. Many other countries have done this under much worse circumstances and with less historical claim to the land (e.g. Kosovo), yet they had support from the US &amp; UK. Crimea was only Ukrainian during Soviet times, and had Ukraine not decided to move toward NATO via a Western-backed coup d'√©tat‚Äîblocking Russia's access to a vital port in the process‚Äîthe whole situation would have been avoided. You don't find it strange that so many people now care about this little piece of land? Does the will of the Russian people living in Crimea not matter?

The rest of your examples are disputed and they only serve as propaganda at this point. Russia doesn't need to use chemical weapons to kill people in foreign countries. It offers no benefit to Russia and exposes them to political blowback. Why would anyone pragmatic put themselves into that situation? Or do you also think Assad gassed his own people while the virtuous white helmets were there to help? Try reading news from sources that cover competing geopolitical interests.

Don‚Äôt be fooled: these people aren‚Äôt publishing articles critical of Putin because they have genuine concern for the well-being of the Russian people. They‚Äôre merely trying to protect American geopolitical interests, and that includes ensuring Russia remain as weak as possible, the health of its citizens be damned (and that may be a feature, not a bug).

There is an illusion of democracy in the US that keeps everyday citizens entertained and largely content, while ignoring the fact that a handful of media conglomerates drive the entirety of public discourse and essentially dictate which candidates succeed.

Sure you do.  Treaties bind their members, not anyone else.  We were talking about customary international law precisely because Turkey's lack of membership to the UNCLOS meant that the only way that your claim has any basis would be if the EEZ definition and agreement to discard conflicting claim had been part of customary international law, which affects even non-members.

Turkey may well have no legitimate basis to be on Cyprus in the first place.  I don't have familiarity with the issues there.  But that's not the point that you were arguing.

No dispute.

&gt; Whether a particular outlet leans left or right is largely irrelevant.

The particular outlet most-certainly matters when we're talking about what the outlet is publishing.  You just made an unsupported assertion that there was a concerted smear campaign by media in the ""American sphere of influence"".  You didn't just say that it *existed*, but that one would have to be a *moron* not to see that it existed.

I don't think that *The Guardian* needs any kind of influence or coordination from anyone to criticize Russia.

Russia's intelligence agencies used chemical weapons to wack some guy on British soil.  That was after they wacked another guy on British soil with radiological weapons.  They are occupying parts of two European countries, and annexed part of one.  They shot down an airliner in the process and refused to pay compensation to those killed.  They ran an extensive disinformation campaign.  Shit, I'm not gonna try to list all this.

4066,"**Cologne**

*Along the banks of the river Rhine lies one of Germanias oldest and biggest cities. Founded by the Romans as Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium in 19bc, the city has seen a lot of growth, strife and struggle. The reliquary of the three Kings was moved from Milan to Cologne, boosting its importance in the christian world. To honour it, a massive cathedral began construction, though construction is currently on hold due to lack of funds. With its recent entry into the Hanseatic league, Cologne further solidified its economic importance. In Cologne rules the Elector Archbishop, also being the Arch-chancellor of Italy, appointed by his holiness the Pope, making it the second highest ranked Imperial Prince behind Mainz. 
The Archdiocese of Cologne nominally also ruled over Bishoprics such as M√ºnster and Li√®ge, however our influence is waning thus those are, de facto, independent. Overall much of its glory is beginning to fade among other more powerful states rising, and Cologne must remain vigilant to not fade into obscurity.*

*Chapter 1: The Schism*

Disillusioned with the Papacies' failure to excommunicate our breakaway states and rivals, the Archbishop Elector sought to change his denomination, seeking independence from the Holy See. Diplomats were sent out into eastern realms to look for a sponsor for a mass conversion, and the Emperor was contacted whether he would allow such a step, which he did.

After years of search, the Duchy of Lithuania was willing to sponsor our conversion and Cologne and its people converted to the Orthodox faith. Despite this, the Archbishoprics of Mainz and Trier were stil willing to enter into an alliance. Missionaries were sent into our remaining Westphalian possessions around Paderborn, but M√ºnster didn't like that. Not. One. Bit.

*Chapter 2: No peace in Westphalia*

Seeing as we had disagreements over the M√ºnsteran sovereignty anyway, the soldiers were readied and war was declared. We wanted to ambush them so their and their allies' armies could not merge, however the plan failed horribly and in 2 battles our entire army was wiped out. Panic took hold in Cologne which now only had the protection of its walls and garrison. Of course our old rivals in D√ºsseldorf let the enemy armies pass and the siege began. But druing the nights we snuck out envoys to search for help. After some weeks our prayers were heard: The newly crowned King of Bohemia, Jir√≠ z Podebrad agreed to help us, as he himself had some disagreements with the catholic church as well. The Bohemians and Silesians turned the tide, Hessen was vassalised and the city of M√ºnster taken and converted. Efforts to rebuild the army were slow though and the missionaries had only succesfully converted one of our Westphalian provinces yet, so the populace in the other saw their opportunity and rose up, instantly illing our fresh recruits. After seeking help from other rulers the most honourable King-elector of Bohemia again stepped in and put down our rebels, giving us time to finally rebuild an army. This had forever indebted us to them, however that wasn't the only debt we had.

*Chapter 3: Recovery*

Paying our missionaries to convert the land again put further strain on the treasury. At first the plan was to cut expenses everywhere possible, so the army pay was reduced and the fort mothballed. It still wasn't enough and to prevent going into a debt spiral, a risk was taken which turned out to be well worthwhile. 

D√ºsseldorf, who not only had let our enemies pass but also set up a river toll, stifling our trade, had to be put down and the loot should be used for some of our debt. The Hessian vassalstate was now loyal as well, having seen our perseverance, and so we took on the Clevian armies and their allies and emerged victorious after 2 years, plundering the coffers of all their alies and fully annexing the duchy of Cleves, finally connecting our possessions.

Then, the two free cities of Aachen and Frankfurt were targeted, as both had denounced us as rivals. We declared a humiliation war, where the rich city of Frankfurt had to pay us and we showed Aachen our strength. Now our debt was almost entirely repaid and [glory](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/543591586265563174/668623478987030538/SPOILER_20200120020911_1_-_Kopie.jpg) was restored to [Cologne](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/543591586265563174/668623486750818305/SPOILER_20200120020921_1.jpg), but the manpower reserves are fully depleted and we would have to wait another generation of recruits to comfortably wage war again.

Alas, there is no time for that as our neighbours hadn't been resting either, and there are still lands which are rightfully ours which are not under control, yet.

4089,"From the paper, about how they assessed whether someone is politically informed, uninformed or misinformed:
&gt;Independent variables and controls 

&gt;We use three political knowledge questions to operationalise our core
explanatory concepts, namely political information and misinformation, as two separate variables. These three items ask respondents (i) to visually recognise an EU-level politician, (ii) what ‚Äòbudget deficit‚Äô means, and (iii) who sets the interest rates in their country. Each item has five answer categories and respondents could answer correctly, incorrectly, or ‚Äòdon‚Äôt know‚Äô. Our political information indicator ranges from ‚Äònot correctly informed‚Äô (those who answered incorrectly and those who admitted they did not know) to ‚Äòcorrectly informed‚Äô (those who answered correctly).
Our political misinformation indicator ranges from ‚Äòno incorrect information‚Äô (those who answered correctly and those who admitted they did not know) to ‚Äòincorrect information‚Äô (those who answered incorrectly).
Hence, there is a clear difference between those who declare not to be correctly informed (i.e. uninformed), and those who provide wrong answers, and are thus misinformed. Uninformed individuals receive low values on both variables, as they are not correctly, but also not incorrectly, informed. Conversely, high levels of misinformation are associated with low values on the information variable, and high values on the misinformation variable.

So it is basically a kind of Dunning-Kruger test.
Someone who gives an incorrect answer but admits that they aren't sure about it is merely ""uninformed"".
Someone who gives an incorrect answer while at the same time being cocksure about it is ""misinformed"".

The actual test questions would be in the online appendix, which i can't access.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/er37vc/political_misinformation_found_to_be_related_to/ff2at9k/,frbnfr,1579499010

4092,"&gt; Again like Stalin, retirement is not a safe option for the ruthless ex-KGB spy who normalised assassination as a modern-day tool of state policy. To yield power would be to invite retribution, legal or physical.

So, that's actually been the most-common outcome since Tsar Nicholas II.  People typically haven't left power smoothly for a peaceful retirement.  I'd say that Putin actually has considerably-improved chances of doing so compared to most of his predecessors.

China's economy is expected to surpass the US's, but it won't do anything like become five times as large over the next century.

4286,"I know this is a Belgian court ruling and a mod looking at this may find that this isn't specifically about the entirety of Europe, but I think this is an interesting topic and does involve Europe due to the current listing the EU has put on the PKK. This ruling directly contradicts the EU's terror listing.

Although [in 2018 The European Union Court of Justice ruled that the Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party (PKK) was wrongly on the list of terrorist organisations](https://eldh.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Interwiew-with-Mahmut-%C5%9Eakar-Co-Chairman-of-MAF-DAD-e.V.-.pdf), however for some reason they're still included in the list. This is more likely due to political reasons and essentially keeping Turkey happy.

The Belgian court looks at this differently and argues it in context of what is happening.

&gt;The court judged that the PKK, including their armed branch that is known as the People‚Äôs Defense Forces (HPG), is to be considered a non-state actor involved in an intensive non-international conflict between the PKK and the Turkish state. 

The conflict has waged on for almost half a century and does not look to be ending as the Kurdish struggle in Turkey is reaching no where and improvements that occurred in the past all seem to be being reversed by the current Turkish regime.

Fundamentally the right to fight for your freedom should NOT make you a terrorist and I think this ruling is a great example of courts actually working properly. There is no easy way around this. The PKK is not out for Turkey to be destroyed or wants death on its people. Their fight simply exists due to the issues the Kurds face in Turkey and hence why they started in the first place.",,/r/europe/comments/er4nqf/belgian_court_pkk_not_a_terrorist_organization/ff1i9my/,Hipervan,1579479645

4307,"&gt; Cars are very useful. I would fully agree that we should get to having a lot less of them and get more transport into public transit systems.

Cars are very useful for a very limited amount of people. 

 &gt; But cars will still be needed for various reasons and those cars should then be EV instead of ICE.

I can see some companies keeping them but for personnal use but most of the use case could be removed thanks to proper public transportation. 

&gt; Please provide some information on that. It's the first time I hear about that and I'm curious what you mean.

Remember the whole Volkswagen scandal worlwide? Well, one of their justification was they can't compete against Toyota who had a massive investment in fuel efficient cars due to Japan's lack of petrol resources at first and later the fact that cars polluted too much later. 

[2006 in the timeline](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/business/volkswagen-diesel-emissions-timeline.html). 

&gt; Yes I can say that because there is really no alternative. At any given time we have to work with what's available and research better solutions to switch to eventually.

Oh my bad, I though we didn't have time already because the consequences of climate change are going stronger each day. 

&gt; Everything has issues. Everything has trade-offs. Li-Ion batteries are the best we have NOW. So it's what we have to use for now. Until we find better soluitions. What's the alternative in your opinion? Keep using fossiles? Not an option. Li-Ion batteries c an be done now and already are starting to becoming an effective alternative to ICE vehicles.

The best is public transport and bikes. Li-Ion maybe an option today but their lifetime is quite short and is absolutely horrible to mine and to recycle. 

I'm gonna stop here because all I see, is that you have a circlejerk about EV. It seems you only take EV as a solution to actually scrub CO¬≤ which is definitely not the case.

4437,"""A map of the world that does not contain the country Utopia does not deserve even a glance,"" said Oscar Wilde. 

This statement underlies the idea that we need the encouragement of arriving at this mysterious place so that, once reached, we embark again in search of a better one. That is what progress consists in, the commitment to the successive realization of utopias.

Until recently, at least since the enlightenment, this impulse to imagine more perfect societies was the engine of our civilization. Now we have deleted them from the map. Literally. The West sails today as an orphan of utopias, has ceased to believe in continuous and linear progress. All his efforts now consist in avoiding those other territories in which we can run aground, dystopia, the radical reverse of what would be a more desirable world. It is the moment in which hope - the emotion that sustains the utopian spirit - becomes fear, the fuel from which dystopia is nourished.

We don't know how to do what we think is necessary, and that produces the feeling of dancing without a net

I think it is not necessary to provide many arguments to support such a strong X signing.

It is enough to resort to the alarmism caused by climate change. But next to him is the concern for the future of democracy and the regrowth of self-rivalry; the new (anti) geopolitical order, which has rekindled the fear of nuclear war; deglobalization and its possible impact on economic growth - and also on the return to walled borders to repel migration; an uncontrolled hypertechnology, etc. 


Each of these elements, isolated or cascading, presents its own catastrophic scenarios, as we can see in biased specialized studies of hard and soft sciences.

However, where this syndrome that haunts us disaster finds its most graphic expression is in the current explosion of dystopian fiction. There is no series or film about the future - and they proliferate more and more, which does not take the form of dystopia, sometimes shocking. 

And for some years now there have also appeared some great novels that have raised the genre, such as Margaret Atwood's books on The Tale of the Maid, the feminist dystopia par excellence; or that of Nobel Kazuo Ishiguro Never abandon me, about the dangers of human cloning; or Submission, of Houellebecq, the crude portrait of the wreck of Western civilization.

 It will be said that, as a literary genre, more than its catastrophic content matters the narration of the attitudes and feelings of its characters, their reactions to borderline situations; that is, the creation of a counterfactual that allows us to approach the human condition.

 That, in short, they are only fictions that reveal the vulnerability and fragility that hangs over everything human and are, therefore, timeless issues. Definitely. But outside projections supported by scientific data, not always reliable, is it possible to say something about the future that does not take the form of ""fiction""?

Technocalipsis and Frankenstein's syndrome

A 1984 scene by Michael Radford, based on the most popular dystopia of all, by George Orwell.

On the other hand, dystopia is also a reflection of fears perfectly contextualize them, reactions and warnings against real dangers. They were, for example, 1984, by Orwell, the product of the experience of totalitarianism, or A happy world, by Aldous Huxley, which presents the consequences of the application of advances in the bio-technological control of the human being in order to create a supposed ideal society. 

What underlies these literary creations is not built, then, on mere literary imagination; build from data that is before our eyes. Basically, they are more a narrative about the present and the risks to which we are exposed than about the future itself; They have an obvious admonitory character: if we don't react, if we don't act, now! 

Responsibly, the catastrophe - climate, politics, nuclear ... - can be just around the corner.

That is why it is a properly modern genre, something that accompanied the man from his perception of the ambivalences associated with the promising impulse unleashed by the development of science and the consequences of industrialization. Note how the deployment of these same capacities is, paradoxically, the same that fed the utopian contents of the idea of progress. 

Utopia and dystopia are two sides of the same coin. One only looks at the part of light, the effective possibilities that open to human action - emancipation and control over nature, the possible planning of a world without the scourges of disease, scarcity and injustice. ; the other enters its shadow zones, as we find reflecting premonitory - in 1818! - in the Frankenstein of Mary Shelley, where the creature product of human ingenuity turns against its creator.

This same syndrome is also present throughout the subgenus of dystopia associated with technological development, which so well reflect series such as Black Mirror Years and Years, which has the virtue of presenting, one after another, all our current fears about our future. During the Cold War almost all the social imaginary was occupied by the fear of atomic confrontation. 

Then he went on to reflect on the risk society ""(from the sociologist Ulrich Beck), the warning about the unconscious dangers of an irresponsible technological society -Bhopal and Chernobyl were two important alarm signals. - Now he focuses on cyberspace, algorithms and artificial intelligence, associated with new, subtle and sibylline forms of surveillance and control that can lead to a light totalitarianism, closer to Huxley's model than Orwell's.

Rather than alarm us, dystopia distracts; more than calling for action, they favor that everything remains the same

As we said at the beginning, there are sufficient reasons to distrust the future. We no longer perceive this as the paradise of freedom, security and emancipation that enlightenment promised us. But we were fully aware of this after the two great wars and the experience of the Holocaust and the Gulag. 

Even so, we were able to recover, the hope and civilizational optimism returned. Perhaps because we managed to enter, with all the asymmetries we want, in fairer societies and in a considerable improvement of living conditions across the planet. Wars were limited and great evils were fought more effectively, such as miser and disease. 
So why this morbid delight in presenting final scenarios for humanity wars were limited and great evils were fought more effectively, such as misery and disease.

 So why this morbid delight in presenting final scenarios for humanity or ingenious science fiction fables in which our dreams turn into nightmares? 

One of the possible answers is that everything apocalyptic, so present in the collective unconscious of our civilization, sells better than sluggish accounts of reconciled and happy societies. We see it in the headlines, where catastrophism prevails, and in all dystopian fiction. In a way, ""consuming it"" allows us to sublimate our anxiety. It is not in vain that it is presented as ""fictional"" and somewhere in an uncertain future that we will never see, and they are part of the entertainment industry; rather than alarming us, they distract us; rather than calling us to action, they favor everything to remain the same.",,/r/europe/comments/er0yw6/we_need_to_fight_against_the_current_state_of/ff003yp/,Tavirio,1579463703

4502,"&gt;So the US is impossible?

The US has largely exogamous migrant communities. In fact, it is the perfect example of how integration is an organic process first and foremost. This in turn, is fueled by the lack of religious differences between US Americans and migrants. Almost all migrants from Latam, Africa and the Caribbean are Christian and, more rarely, secular. Even among the most religiously diverse group - Asian Americans - nearly 60% were either C[hristian or non-religious](http://www.asian-nation.org/religion.shtml#sthash.aZKLlvVx.dpbs) in 2008, and anyway the entire group is highly educated and thus widely exposed to US-dominated culture. It comes as no surprise that intermarriage rates, cultural behaviours, etc. rapidly converge in the second and third generation.

4504,"OK. You choose not to address a single thing from all these I mentioned.

Anyway, here is my answer to your post. I think you are wrong and here is why:

&gt;It should be obvious our current system is not working and results in crime and abuse. Choosing to keep the current policy is choosing to keep failing and uphold the crime and abuses.

Migrants suffer most of the abuse and particularly the most inhuman forms of abuse in the hands of their traffickers:[https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/equfhk/europe\_has\_an\_islamophobi%D0%B0\_problem\_whos\_going\_to/fezan5i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/equfhk/europe_has_an_islamophobi%D0%B0_problem_whos_going_to/fezan5i/)

Giving them legal status when they arrive to Europe won't offer them any protection from their traffickers and of course will not transform traffickers from cruel criminals to saints.

In the contrary, if we reach again the same number of arrivals as in 2015 obviously more people will get victimized by the smugglers.

I don't understand why if Europe is going to receive, lets say for example a total of 1.000.000 migrants, those arrivals can't be through legal channels without the use of traffickers. That's what can offer the maximum protection to them and also the best quality of life when they will reach Europe, because planned arrivals will be accompanied by sufficient resources for them.",,/r/europe/comments/equfhk/europe_has_an_islamophobi–∞_problem_whos_going_to/fezd30p/,TravellingAroundMan,1579456076

4566,"If the forest persists that is about as permanent as a capture can be. The forest as a whole will always have a certain amount of trees and altogether trap a certain amount of CO2. By your logic all carbon capture is temporary. Even a gas tank using direct capture will break at some point. According to you that means it¬¥s temporary. 

A forest captures CO2 just as a bog does. That some is released doesn¬¥t matter because once it has reached maturity the amount captured and released is overall equal. Overall a forest captures a certain amount of CO2 just as a bog does.

At best you are being pedantic. But as you used this point to counter the idea that forests capture CO2 (at least that is what you replied to with it) it appears to just be a completely nonsensical argument. 

&amp;#x200B;

Your education isn¬¥t a basis for your claim. Some sort of source or at least some reasoning would be. Otherwise yes you are using it to argue because I asked you to support your claims and that is literally all you replied. 

Your original claim was not that natural forests had a significantly higher biodiversity. It was that a monoculture of trees didn¬¥t provide much ecological support. So no the paper does not at all support your point. I mainly just linked it to show that yes while they obviously are much worse than actual forests they still support a number of species. Surely considerably more than a concrete wasteland would. I admit I could have found a much much better source for that but I frankly just didn¬¥t bother and picked the first paper that looked at biodiversity in artificial forests. 

Anyways someone in the comments linked to [assessment by tesla](https://www.uvp-verbund.de/documents/ingrid-group_ige-iplug-bb/94AFADF0-92F1-44EA-AA54-E1CD7C0FF6AD/UVP-Bericht%20Tesla%20Manufacturing%20Brandenburg%20SE_V1_20-12-202.pdf) about this specific forest. It¬¥s not even a monoculture. The article u/Kaoticos previously linked doesn¬¥t even say it¬¥s a production forest as u/rebootyourbrainstem claimed. It says that it is a former industrial zone that is now a forest. Now it does appear to be commercially used as probably all forests in Germany are but it is far from a simple tree farm. 

And in fact Teslas own assesment found a large number of species including various birds, lizards, bats and potentially wolves. So in conclusion the forest we are talking about is much closer to the fragmented forest the paper looked at which while still having lower biodiversity than natural forests was much better than the plantation. Evidently replacing this forest with a industrial zone would have a negative ecological impact. 

&amp;#x200B;

""We"" (as in the UN and various NGOs) are planting billions (the UN planning to plant one trillion) of trees with the expressed goal of carbon capture. So your claim that we don¬¥t plant trees to capture CO2 is not just irrelevant to the discussion but also flat out wrong. Of course providing/restoring habitats is also part of the plan. The nice thing about planting trees is that it serves many purposes.

4584,"The author makes some valid points, though her piece ingors some valid issues as well.

First of all, when Islamophobia means discrimination or violence against people from a Muslim background or practicing Muslims, it needs to be urgently addressed, as a key tenet of European values is non-discrimination of the individual. You should not need to live in fear because of who you are. Discrimination in employment should also be addressed as it has proven time and again to be a huge issue. There have been multiple studies proving that names and countries of birth drastically alter employment perspectives. It is absurd to welcome someone in your country only to deny him/her the chance to work when he/she tries to do so.

All of this does not mean that highly conservative Muslim communities should be given an easy time by society as a whole. One of the key elements of progress to modern European society has been pushing religion into the private sphere, with any elements of control over the individual being rolled back. This has, for example, enabled throwing the idea of victimless crimes to the dustbin of history (with a few exceptions). Any idea that you can shield your ideological beliefs from condemnation if they stifle individual freedom should be thrown out sans hesitation. And as a society we need to accept that attempts at communitarian control of individual behaviors are far more likely to occur in highly conservative communities, which are more common among migrants with a Muslim background. Muslim communities will need to go through the same process that made it OK to be, say, Catholic but supportive of the right to chose on abortion issues, marry someone of the same sex, etc. in parts of the Western world.",,/r/europe/comments/equfhk/europe_has_an_islamophobi–∞_problem_whos_going_to/fezi41e/,Robi_damian,1579457611

***Politics***

* Our Senate rejected the nomination of [Zakia Khattabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakia_Khattabi) (from the left-wing [Ecolo party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecolo)) as judge to our [Constitutional Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Court_(Belgium)) after a campaign by the right-wing party [N-VA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Flemish_Alliance). They deemed her to be unqualified (since she has no law degree), too activist, and also accused her of having prevented the expulsion of an illegal alien by plane in 2013 (even though a police report refutes this). Khattabi needed a two-thirds majority to be nominated, but only got 38 of the 60 senators to vote in her favour. All senators from right-wing parties N-VA and [Vlaams Belang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlaams_Belang) voted against her, as well as some of the liberal senators. [Related r/belgium thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/epyqiu/senate_rejects_candidacy_zakia_khattabi_ecolo_for/)
* We still don't have a new federal government, and negotiations are still ongoing almost 300 days after the elections. The King has extended the mission of the two *informateurs* (the Flemish christian-democrat [Joachim Coens](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Coens) and the francophone liberal [Georges-Louis Bouchez](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges-Louis_Bouchez)), who's mission is to try to find common ground between the parties to determine what coalitions are possible. The most likely scenarios are still ""purple-yellow"" (socialists, liberals and Flemish-nationalist party N-VA) and ""purple-green"" (socialists, liberals and greens).

***Crime and justice***

* The trial of three doctors started before the [court of assizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_assizes_(Belgium)) (court with the highest criminal jurisdiction in the Belgian legal system) in the city of [Ghent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghent). They are on trial for being involved in the [euthanasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_euthanasia#Belgium) of a 38-year old woman who sought to end her life over psychological suffering. Belgian law permits euthanasia for ""unbearable and incurable suffering"" of an either physical or psychological nature, but attaches a number of requirements. The doctors are accused of not having respected these requirements, and thus having committed ""murder"". The family of the woman claims her condition wasn't incurable, for example, and accuses the doctor who performed the euthanasia of having done so in an amateurish manner. Former friends of the women paint a different story however, and put the family in a negative light. During the jury selection for the trial, one of the doctor's attorneys caused some uproar when he announced he would reject any devout catholic as juror. If found guilty, the three doctors theoretically risk life imprisonment. The trial also risks becoming not only that of the doctors, but that of the euthanasia law itself, and may have a profound impact on the way the topic of euthanasia is handled in Belgium. Because of this, it is being referred to as the ""euthanasia trial"" in the media.

* A number of Syria fighters, who are currently in a refugee camp or Kurdish prison, have appealed a decision made in summary court proceedings. The decision required the federal government to provide the necessary paperwork and consular assistance to the children of these fighters, so they could return to Belgium. The government refused to over fears these children could also serve as the parents' ticket back to Belgium. Now the parents appealed the part of the decision that stated to government was not required to provide them with papers and assistance to allow them to return to Belgium.

* The police freed a 16-year old French girl from the claws of a prostitution gang, and arrested a number of the gang's members. The girl originally ran away from home with her ""boyfriend"", but that ""boyfriend"" sold her for 2,000 euro to the gang, who locked her up and forced her to prostitute herself. It also appears the gang made multiple victims aside from the 16-year old French girl.

4703,"&gt; Sure, it's better over time. But not because of e-Mobility, though, but because Germany is switching energy production.

No, untrue. Germany is switching electricity production. Hardly any change regarding Diesel or gasoline. And I don't think one can make the case that the change isn't due to e-mobility given that the only way transportation can benefit by the change of the electrical energy mix is by... moving to electric cars...

&gt;Just as an aside: ""100% green energy"" is just a PR gag. Unless those charging station operators are producing electricity on site or in a local grid, they'll get the exact same electricity mix as the rest of the grid.

Again, incorrect. What one receives as an end user of electricity is... electricity. It's physically the same everywhere and it does not matter at all how it is produced. You cannot measure where an electron in the grid comes from. So this is a non-argument, really. You don't receive the national energy mix at your socket. You receive whatever ends up in your local grid at that moment, usually from suppliers nearby. 

I mean, if you switch suppliers you might just as well argue that *actually*^tm you still get the electricity from your old supplier. But that's not the point.

The point of 100% green energy contracts is not to ensure that literally every electron coming to your socket was generated renewably. **The point is that exactly the same amount of electricity you consume is produced and added to the grid.** This is what it's about, and this is what matters - to the energy generating company it is irrelevant who, in the end, gets their electricity if they can sell their clean electricity. And the customer of clean electricity wants that his consumption is added to the grid on a renewable basis so as to reduce their own carbon footprint and steer the market, which is both achieved using the current model (certified green electricity can only be sold once and actually has to be added to the grid).",-6 points 9 minutes ago,/r/europe/comments/eqmrlk/youre_stealing_our_water_germans_protest_against/fey7501/,Bojarow,1579441628

4930,"&gt; I guess the truth is in between, but I do have doubts about that ""protected wildlife zone"".

You're right to be, there simply isn't any protected wildlife zone. Under German law, wildlife everywhere is protected in some way. Parts of the area belong to the outer parts of a groundwater reserve, and that's it. Because that's the case there are certain activities that are prohibited in the area. You can look them up [here](https://bravors.brandenburg.de/verordnungen/wsg_erkner) under the ¬ß¬ß 3 and 4. Basically it's about not breaking up the ground, not using substances posing a threat to the groundwater supply (especially not manure and fertilizer) and not conducting animal farming which should not be a problem in Teslas case. 

However, the Tesla factory will of course require backup Diesel generators, and of course handling of chemicals e.g. for car painting and so on. This will either be done outside of the mentioned areas or under a special exemption license according to ¬ß 52 WHG (1) sentence 2 which can only be granted if the general intent of the Groundwater protection law is adhered to and will require mitigation measures, for example the chemicals must be stored in a sealed tank which is designed to protect against leakage and so on.

In theory it's also forbidden to plan new industrial zones in such an area, however the exemption for that was already granted twenty years ago when Brandenburg wanted BMW to build its new factory there (that's why Tesla chose the area, it has long been intended as a car factory location).",-6 points 9 minutes ago,/r/europe/comments/eqmrlk/youre_stealing_our_water_germans_protest_against/fexab75/,Bojarow,1579427619

4996,"&gt; Depends a lot. There is a lot of potential in eletric cars. But for it to be really good you actually need to massivly improve electicity production. The production of the car in itself is also not exactly fantastic either.

Recent EU research on the total lifetime benefits of electric cars shows that a new electric car today, with today's energy mix, is already better for the environment than fossil fuel cars. And energy mix is improving every day.

There is a lot of lies and propaganda about this, but the numbers just don't show what you are worried about.

I kinda hate the Musk fanboyism, but mostly it's like the musk haters, not much information behind it, just grabbing whatever article or link they can find that supports their emotions. It's easily ignored and doesn't bother me much.

Europe as a whole is in a ton of trouble and has been for a while. Tesla is not the first nor the largest electric car company. The others are all in China. It will take a while, but they are coming over here, there is just too much money in it and they are improving steadily and learning the details of the western markets.

Tesla is, if anything, showing that there is still a chance for western companies to compete. I'm hopeful.

Certainly German companies are not like US companies, but they are a *lot* more like US companies than Chinese companies. If Tesla can do it, then German companies can as well. Maybe not the oldest ones though, but that's life. If a market changes too much, old companies fail to adapt and hopefully new ones come in their place. If a government tries to fight it all they will prevent is the new companies rising, the old ones cannot be saved by anyone but themselves.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/eqmrlk/youre_stealing_our_water_germans_protest_against/fewv1bn/,rebootyourbrainstem,1579419927

The thing is, he's been painted as a fraud and a hypocrite in the media, and I think that's exactly where they are wrong. He's sometimes kind of an asshole and sometimes misinformed or clueless, but that's not the same thing. 

The fact that he really, genuinely lives for his companies and believes they are for the good of humankind, and that a lot of people agree with that sentiment (highly educated engineers choose to work there, even though their wages aren't the highest and the pressure is insane), and that Tesla in particular has maybe done more for the climate than most left wing protest organizations (by proving that no-compromise top end electric cars are possible, thus jump-starting a real move to electric instead of all the market-segmenting bullshit) is very hard to accept.

For the left, it is not possible to have a CEO be interested in the good of humanity and trying to align his businesses with that. In fact, most people in the center would have trouble believing that. It sounds like blatant lies and hypocrisy.

#### RATHER FALSE. INDEED, THE WORDS OF MAREK JƒòDRASZEWSKI ARE CONTROVERSIAL AND THE WORDS OF JESUS CHRIST HAVE CAUSED CONTROVERSY. HOWEVER, THEY WERE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT KIND OF CONTROVERSY, AND THE COMPARISON OF THESE TWO CHARACTERS IS RIDICULOUS

OKO.press in one agrees Father Sitarz: things should be named by name.

&gt;**So, naming a matter by name, it must be said that there is a significant difference between the message of love that Jesus Christ preached according to the Gospel and the message of hatred in which Marek Jƒôdraszewski specialized.**

OKO.press does not usurp the excessive competence in theology and biblical studies, which is why we decided to check the differences between Jesus Christ and Marek Jƒôdraszewski in practice: by comparing specific statements of these two characters. We answer the possible charge of sacrilege: we did not come up with this risky idea for believers.

## About judgments about others

* Marek Jƒôdraszewski:

The so-called 'anti-violence' convention and the in vitro act, the 'gender reconciliation act' can be considered a betrayal of the moral values ‚Äã‚Äãfor which the Warsaw Uprising broke out. (...) Referring to the poem by J√≥zef Andrzej Szczepa≈Ñski titled ""The Red Plague"", which is one great accusation of Red Bolshevism, we must state unequivocally: now a leftist plague is coming to us. ""

*- August 2015, homily on the 71st anniversary of the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising*

* Jesus Christ:

""Do not judge and you will not be judged. For with the judgment you think and they will judge you; and the measure you measure will measure you. ""

*- Matthew's Gospel*

## About godlessness

* Marek Jƒôdraszewski:

""It is necessary to fully realize the fact that 'Halloween' goes back to the pagan celebration of the festival of ghosts and the Celtic god of death. It is therefore a fundamentally anti-Christian holiday. ""

*- Text in 'Sunday Guest', October 2013*

* Jesus Christ:

""Everyone who is angry with his brother is subject to judgment. (...) And whoever would say to him: ""Godless"", shall be punishable by the fire of hell. ""

*- Matthew's Gospel*

## On abuses of priests

* Marek Jƒôdraszewski:

""This formulation \[the principle of zero tolerance for pedophilia\], often used in the media, is somewhat totalitarian. (...) When Nazism fought against Jews, he applied ""zero tolerance"" to them, resulting in the Holocaust. When the Bolshevik system applied ""zero tolerance"" to the enemies of the people, there was another massacre on a scale of tens or even hundreds of millions of victims. ""

""The house is to be a house of prayer, **and you make it a cave of robbers**.""

*- Matthew's Gospel*

## About enemies

* Marek Jƒôdraszewski:

""The red plague is no longer happening in our land, which does not mean that there is no new one that wants to master our souls, hearts and minds. Not Marxist, Bolshevik, but born of the same spirit, Neo-Marxist. Not red, but rainbow. ""

## Vatican about the apostolate of love

OKO.press supports the diagnosis that the meaning of the words Jesus Christ controversied 2000 years ago is significantly different from the sense of Marek Jƒôdraszewski's statements in the second decade of the 21st century. However, the problem is not only about the easy to verify absurd comparison used by Fr. Miros≈Çaw Sitarz - it is much deeper. The Polish Church is more and more often using her authority to celebrate and under the pretext of sending a message of love to haters.

That was, among others on the occasion of another homophobic hatter, that is, ""Saint. Thomas of Ikea.

### Homophobe released from IKEA appointed a ""lay apostle."" The episcopate is plunging into an LGBT obsession

July 8, 2019

We would like to remind you that ""Mr. Tomasz"" (in fact, he has a different name) in response to IKEA's appeal for tolerance towards LGBT people and contributing to the ""integration culture"", he posted on the employee forum:

""Accepting and promoting homosexuality and other deviations is a scandal. The Holy Scriptures say: ""Woe to him through whom scandals come, it would be better for him to tie a millstone around his neck and plunge him into the depths of the sea."" And also: ¬ªWhoever makes body contact with a man commits disgust, just as he does with a woman.

&gt;**Both will be punished with death and their blood will fall on them. """"**

The company found that in this way it violated the ""internal regulations"" and ""principles of social coexistence"" (Article 100 ¬ß2 p. 6 of the Labor Code) and released him (a set of quotes and a description of the whole case - [here](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=pl&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://oko.press/wiceminister-romanowski-z-opus-dei-wypowiada-wojne-ikei-ziobrysci-biora-homofoba-na-sztandary/&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700256,15700259,15700262,15700265,15700271&amp;usg=ALkJrhiBHmk0Uo-TSayXYyq_PfNg2mfhMA) ). The Church was involved in the defense of the homophobe, and the Council of the Polish Episcopal Conference called him a ""lay apostle.""

&gt;**""Congratulations to Mr. Tomasz for courage in defending faith in everyday life.** **This is the apostolate of the laity postulated by the Second Vatican Council in the decree Apostolicam actuositatem. ""**

\- wrote on behalf of the KEP Council for the Apostolate of the Laity, Bishop Ignacy Dec. We then looked at the documents listed by the hierarchy.

""The Church was made to live by spreading the kingdom of Christ to the glory of the Father, to make all people participants in redemption and direct the whole world to Christ. Any activity to this end is called apostolate, ""concludes the conciliar decree.

Lay people can also ""carry out the apostolate through their work to spread the Gospel and sanctify people and to infuse with the evangelical spirit and to improve the order of worldly affairs,"" with ""the soul of all apostolate is love.""

&gt;**The decree repeatedly returns to the ""commandment of love, which is the Lord's greatest command.""**

The Council decree recommends defending the principles of faith, which, however, is to be expressed in a message other than proclaiming hateful condemnation: ""let the laity imbibe their lives with love and, if possible, give it expression in deeds.""

Also, the exhortation of John Paul II, in many matters categorical, especially when it comes to sexual ethics, and calling for the defense of the family against secularization, primarily encourages the creation of positive Christian family models and upbringing. This is far from the ""apostolate of contempt and exclusion"" performed by Tomasz of Ikea and archbishop Jƒôdraszewski's homily who condemn minority groups.

The message of the hate against LGBT people is also contrary to the teaching of Pope Francis, who in April 2019 stated: ""It is not good to attach more importance to the adjective"" homosexual ""than to the noun"" person "". We are all human and we have dignity. It doesn't matter who you are or how you live - you don't lose your dignity.

&gt;**There are people who prefer to choose or exclude people because of the adjective.** **They don't have a human heart ""(more about it** [**here**](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=pl&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://oko.press/wiceminister-romanowski-z-opus-dei-wypowiada-wojne-ikei-ziobrysci-biora-homofoba-na-sztandary/&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700256,15700259,15700262,15700265,15700271&amp;usg=ALkJrhiBHmk0Uo-TSayXYyq_PfNg2mfhMA) **).**

## Jƒôdraszewski's position is growing

It is also worth emphasizing that the bizarre juxtaposition of the Polish hierarch with the messiah did not fall from the lips of the first priest from the shore, but a respectable priest, professor of a large and respected Polish university.

&gt;This corresponds approximately to the water consumption required to produce one kilogram of beef.

I thought the number seemed insanely high, so I Googled it and it looks like it's legit. Apparently, it includes everything, even the water required to grow the grass the cows eat, and that's why the number is so high.  

&gt;In the article Professor Hoekstra actually wrote that producing one kilogram of boneless beef required about 155 litres of water, taking into account only the water used for drinking and servicing that animal.  
However, when you added in 1300kg of grain, 7200kg of roughages (pasture, dry hay, silage and other roughages), and the water required to grow those feed sources, he said the water footprint of 1 kg of beef would add up to 15,500 litres of water.

[Source](https://www.beefcentral.com/news/does-it-really-take-20000l-of-water-to-produce-1kg-of-beef/) is obviously biased, but the numbers supposedly come from the original author of the *15,000L per kilo of beef* claim (Professor Arjen Hoekstra wrote the original article which [IME](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/10/how-much-water-food-production-waste) used as a source later on).",Slovenia,/r/europe/comments/eqmrlk/youre_stealing_our_water_germans_protest_against/fewjbch/,ShEsHy,1579411752

&gt;Paltry rainfall has left valley farmers with less water than ever. Last year, they were hit with a staggering blow: all farmers who got their water from the federal Central Valley Project, which provides water to over three million acres of farmland, including six of the country‚Äôs seven most productive farming counties, would receive no water at all. This move forced the farmers to use water already in reserve or, if possible, to buy water from another source. Things didn‚Äôt get better this year. The farmers again didn‚Äôt receive any allocations from the Central Valley Project, and the group has little faith in any of Governor Brown‚Äôs plans to address the issue.

There's a long history.

&gt; The California water wars were a series of political conflicts between the city of Los Angeles and farmers and ranchers in the Owens Valley of Eastern California over water rights. 

-

&gt;By 1924, farmers and ranchers rebelled.[2] A series of provocations by Mulholland were, in turn, followed by corresponding threats from local farmers, and the destruction of Los Angeles property.[1]:93 Finally, a group of armed ranchers seized the Alabama Gates and dynamited part of the system, letting water return to the Owens River.[2]",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/eqmrlk/youre_stealing_our_water_germans_protest_against/fevxd3y/,duisThias,1579402690

Votes. Many people vote for politicians who preach against corporations.

Edit: So, why is it corruption to speak the way people want? Answer: because that's demagoguery,  it's populism, not democracy. 

Democracy depends on a well informed people. When a politician makes speeches against corporations, that's appealing to blind emotions, without informed facts. In this specific case, talking about ""300 cubic meters per hour"" is appealing to ignorant voters who assume that's a **HUGE** amount of water, when it's really a tiny amount.",,/r/europe/comments/eqmrlk/youre_stealing_our_water_germans_protest_against/fevyd7e/,MasterFubar,1579403111

5340,"""German Policy"", calling it a policy is not really that accurate. I think you comment is a bit....lets call it polemic? 

You comment make it sound like they existed a 1000 years old conspiracy and everyone from Otto I  to Hitler acted to it. 

""Slavic Lands"": Some of the areas were inhabited by some Germanic people, before the [Migration Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration_Period) when those people left the areas and began to migrate / raid into the imploding Roman Empire. If the Slavic People pushed them or the Slavs just moved into now less populated land is not really clear.  Despite that the Germanic people that lived there also replaced a Celtic culture before. The whole Period is still very vague and there are many sometimes contradicting hypothesis.  

The expansion of Germanic people further to the east for most of the time is  linked to factors like: 

1. Difference in population density and increase in population in German speaking areas. Linked to it is the founding years of permanent settlements on a broader scale, it all started just much earlier further west than east.

2. Migration encouragements by the ruler of the territories. They paid advertisers to go to German / Dutch / Belgian / Austrian towns to get people moving there.

3. Available tools and techniques, most new settlers had better access to it. One big impact was the adaption of the Three-Field System. The adaption of this crop rotation is responsible for an increase of population in Europe that lasted until the black death epidemic. On the Polish Wikipedia i found this...

&gt; W Polsce tr√≥jpol√≥wka pojawi≈Ça siƒô w II po≈Çowie XII wieku, zaczƒô≈Ça siƒô upowszechniaƒá w wiekach XIII i XIV w zwiƒÖzku z rozwojem lokacji na prawie niemieckim. 

I do not speak polish but my mediocre knowledge of Russian and  Google translate tells me enough to see that it confirms this point

Let me talk about the Teutonic Order...i believe it is one of the most misunderstood organizations. For German Neo-Nazis and other confused people they are Heroes, fighting for German culture, for some Slavs the Knights are the most evil thing after Hitler. I believe the Teutonic Order cared about two things: Religion and Money. Their goal was to start Raids to establish a presence to spread Christianity and get money to found more Raids. The spread of German culture was a byproduct of it never really the purpose. Bu if you look at a random YouTube video covering the topic you would think that the Battle of Grunwald is starting again in the form of YouTube comments.  

Generally i think the problem is that most research about this topic started in the19th century. A time period influenced by the emerging of nationalism, so the topic of the ""Ostsiedlung"" was researched and written about in a very biased way. German historians pictured the German settlers as heroic conquerors and saw the topic as a prove for the German supremacy. Polish intellectuals that were working in the underground calling for polish independence saw the settlers as invaders, the interested in events like the battle of Grunwald was extremely high at that time and many poles made connections to the situation they were living in right now. From there on, the two narratives were used whenever needed by various groups. The Nazis of course used it for justification of the annexation of Poland and their horrible war crimes committed on Slavic People in general. Their whole ideology of Slavic inferiority was linked with how they saw the ""Ostsiedlung"" . Also the Soviets made use of it, when they ordered the expulsion of German speaking People in Pomerania and Silesia. That the narratives are still stuck today, makes me honestly a bit sad. 

What many idiots completely fail to understand is: People in the medieval times were not family with the concept of nationality, which came much later. 

Also ethnicity as it is seen today was not really that important at that time. In some areas among the new settlers were also Slavs from a different area. In most cases the settlements happened by the respective nobility gave out incentives for settling a new village. Slavs could do it as well in theory, just as Germanic people. A lesser will to cooperate with the nobles and in many cases not speaking the same language reduced their numbers in reality. 

We are living in the 21st Century and they are some people using the mindsets and narratives of the 19th Century for talking about events that happened between the 10th and 15th century....

5351,"The Senate will adopt a law restoring the rule of law. We analyze what the opposition wrote in the repair project

\+ 894

The termination of the mandate of neo-KRS judge members and the election of new ones respecting the Constitution, liquidation of the Supreme Court Disciplinary Board and fewer powers for the Minister of Justice - these are some of the assumptions of the draft recovery act, which was submitted by opposition senators. The amendment is to end the legal chaos and adapt the provisions to the judgment of the CJEU of November 19, 2019

&amp;#x200B;

Work on the project was conducted by a working team under the patronage of Senate Marshal Tomasz Grodzki. Lasted from December 5, 2019. It was then that the Supreme Court Chamber of Labor based on the criteria of the EU Court of Justice ruled that the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court is not a court within the meaning of EU law. And the new National Council of the Judiciary is not an independent body.

&amp;#x200B;

""Given \[...\] the risk of dysfunctionality in the justice system, the draft contains only the most urgent and necessary changes for the correct implementation of the CJEU judgment""

&amp;#x200B;

\- the authors of the project explain in the justification.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, they emphasize that cleaning up after a ""good change"" in the judiciary will require further extensive legislative action - subsequent amendments to the Acts on the National Court Register and the Supreme Court.

NOVEMBER 19, 2019

&amp;#x200B;

The repair project implements the recommendations of the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe, which visited Warsaw on 9-10 January. KW reporters suggested to Polish parliamentarians, among others return to the old way of selecting KRS members.

&amp;#x200B;

By submitting the draft, the opposition shows that it has an idea how to overcome the crisis of the rule of law, which led to the ""reforms"" of PiS. When rejecting the so-called of the ""muzzle"" law on January 17, 2020, it also gave a clear sign that it did not intend to passively observe subsequent attacks on the independence of the judiciary.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, the future of the recovery law seems to be decided. Although the bill has a good chance of reaching the Seym, it is doubtful that the supporters of the United Right will support it. They have an absolute majority there.

&amp;#x200B;

New, better KRS

The project primarily assumes the withdrawal of PiS ""reform"" in the National Council of the Judiciary. As a result, 15 members-judges of the National Court Register in 2018 were elected by the Sejm, not the judicial community.

&amp;#x200B;

KO, Left and PSL senators want to depoliticise the Council and return to the old system. Judge members would be re-elected by the judges themselves:

&amp;#x200B;

Supreme Court - 1 judge of this Court;

appeal courts - 1 common court judge;

regional - 2 judges of common courts;

district - 8 judges of common courts;

military - 1 military court judge;

Supreme Administrative Court - 1 judge of this Court;

voivodship administrative courts - 1 judge of a voivodship administrative court.

In addition to judges, the Ombudsman, the Supreme Bar Council, the National Council of Legal Advisers, the National Council of Prosecutors at the Prosecutor General and a group of at least 2,000 citizens would have the right to nominate a member of the Council.

&amp;#x200B;

The authors of the project also want judges who are not working or within five years until announcement of recruitment to be delegated to the Ministry of Justice, the Chancellery of the President or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs not to be candidates for the National Court Register.

&amp;#x200B;

In this way, they exclude judges involved in current policy.

&amp;#x200B;

Elections to the National Court Register would be direct and secret.

&amp;#x200B;

X-ray the neo-KRS

The project is also to clean up the legal mess related to the activities of the neo-KRS.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, art. 7 talks about

&amp;#x200B;

the termination of the mandate of the Council members and the necessity to elect new members within three months of the Act coming into force. At the same time, all pending judicial appointment proceedings in the National Court Register would be discontinued.

&amp;#x200B;

Judges and assessors appointed at the request of a malformed Council would lose their positions. Within a month of the new law coming into force, they would have to submit a declaration of the office resignation. At the same time, they could report their intention to return to their previous position. And also have the right to reapply for the office of judge, this time in a procedure involving the healed KRS.

&amp;#x200B;

The authors of the project emphasize that the refusal to renounce the office will be interpreted as an obvious and blatant offense against the law ""for which the disciplinary court imposes the penalty of dismissal from the office.""

&amp;#x200B;

To avoid legal chaos, the senators also propose to uphold the judgments given by the panels of judges whose members were defective appointed judges. Within a year of the Act's entry into force, however, such judgments may be appealed or resumed.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the judgments in which the judges of the Supreme Court Disciplinary Board participated would lose their power.

&amp;#x200B;

""Both EU law and the Constitution do not provide for institutions dealing with the administration of justice that are outside the structure of an independent and independent judiciary, in fact constituting an exceptional court,"" emphasize senators.

&amp;#x200B;

Legal experts have repeatedly said that the Disciplinary Chamber fulfills all the features of an exceptional court - provided for by the Polish Constitution only during the war. And they emphasized that the only solution would be its liquidation and removal from the Supreme Court of the judges appointed to it.

&amp;#x200B;

""\[...\] The liquidation of the Disciplinary Chamber results in annulment of all decisions issued by it, as well as termination of service relationship of officials appointed to it. These officials do not have the right to retain the appropriate salary for retiring a judge, ""they emphasize in the explanatory memorandum.

Freedom from pressure

The authors of the project want to restore the courts' lost autonomy and independence from the executive branch.

&amp;#x200B;

And so the President will be able to determine the number of seats in the Supreme Court and the number of Presidents of Chambers only at the request of the General Assembly of Supreme Court Judges. It is the General Assembly, not the President, that will also decide on the content of SN Rules.

&amp;#x200B;

The authors also intend to reduce the competences of the Minister of Justice for the First President of the Supreme Court. The draft assumes, for example, that the first President will elect the disciplinary spokesman for common court judges and his deputies.

5382,"&gt; That's not what happened in Libya, though. We didn't step in there as white knights fighting gallantly against a murderous dictator to put the country at peace.


This is a straw man argument. The western intervention occurred when Qaddafi‚Äôs troops were about to enter Benghazi. The counter factual is not whether western forces put the country at peace or not. The country would have been at war anyway because it was already at war. 

&gt; We stepped in, supported one side against the other, smashed a few crucial things to pieces, turned a blind eye to the fact that some of the warlords we supported committed major atrocities up to the point of turning genocidal (if you don't know what I mean, ask some of the Touareg tribes living along the border regions - that's one of the main reasons why some of them turned brigand and went into the human trafficking business!), and then left without finishing the job, leaving the people hanging out to dry.


Which warlords supported by who committed what atrocities? 


&gt; Their blood is on our hands just as it was on Gaddafi's before. And yes, we're responsible for it, unless you want to overturn a basic principle of international law which has been around since the Nuremburg trials: That the crime of aggression puts the responsibility for everything that follows from it on the aggressor.


International law doesn‚Äôt exist. It never did. The Nuremberg trials hanged nazis because they wanted to hang the Nazis. The Japanese emperor stayed in power because it wasn‚Äôt politically convenient to depose him. The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must. It just so happens that the strong strong party were the mostly democratic  allied forces, while the Nazis were the weak.


You think Soviet Union was punished for invading Poland in 1939? That didn‚Äôt happen at the Nuremberg trials. You‚Äôre living in a fantasy land.

5399,"&gt; I think it was pretty clear from their comment that Musk sucking up to Erdogan means he probably wouldn't refrain from corporate lobbying in democracies either.

Off course he lobbies. He is a big businessman?

How do you go from ""he lobbies"" to ""he doesn't care about the environment?

I mean, you must know that some people that lobby do care about the environment?

Those two things do not exclude each other. It's like saying ""this guy writes emals, therefore he is not a vegan"".

&gt;The fact that he doesn't care about the environment is evidenced by the fact that he wants Republicans to remain in control of the US Congress. 

He is not American, so he cannot vote I guess?

He gave the Rep Pac some money. That doesn't mean he wants them to win. You need to stay friends with politicians if you are a big business guy, so you donate some money.

He doesn't say much about politics, but it is pretty obvious he'd be in favour of the Dems. Solar power is not really a Rep thing lol.

&gt;And by the fact that Musk is currently wasting 500,000 litres of jet fuel a year, flying on one of the most inefficient private jets in existence, a Gulfstream G650ER, which he bought specifically to replace his more ""environmentally-friendly"" Dassault Falcon 900 that was twice as fuel-efficient.

Oh not not this ... Individuals mean nothing in the big picture. It's the same as people saying Obama does not believe in global warming because he bought a beach house, and Al Gore takes planes and what not.

It matters not what individuals do for global warming. It matters what millions and hundreds of millions do.

5459,"dreams and dreams. I again urge you to watch that video to learn about Turkish perspective. Because there is only one uncivilized country here and it's the Greece. And their mentality that belongs to 1940's.

Also Turkey's economy is not and will not ""shrink"" I don't know where did you get that information but it seems like you lack LOTS of information about lots of things.

Turkey's economy is fine and will be fine. In fact going against US was a bald move for Turkey yet we lived with minimum damage. And that only proved one point, and it's; even if Turkey go against US again things will be fine in Turkey and investments in Turkey will be fine, which this gives lots of confidence to investors that invests or thinking to invest in Turkey.

And there is literally no chance of Greece ever reaching the Turkey's capabilities in terms of military. And Economy ? LMAO Turkey has like 8x of the Greek population it's 83.4 which we are about the overtake Germany which is 83.5. Turkish GDP is over 4x bigger than Greek one if Greece ever would reach such an economy with it's that small shrinking population she would be the by far the richest country on earth WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE. And so what I'am saying even if Turkish economy(which this has like 0% chance) would stagnate for like 50 years Greek GDP would never reach the Turkey's current GDP. I urge you to think realistic please. I've realized that asking this from Greeks kinda insane but PLEASE.

Also you might not have an idea but Greece has one of the worst war-time economies of this world with it's tourism based economy, means even in a slightest conflict when Turkey starts bombing Greek cities or even potential of thi  would shrink whole Greek economy, since you know tourists doesn't tend to go countries that are in middle of war/conflict. Meanwhile Turkey's economy is extremely divers and Turkey is an industrialized country, Also Turkish defence industry is; Well pretty competitive to say, while Greece almost doesn't have one.

5469,"&gt;Why would the moon belong to everyone?

I don't think it is moral for pieces of land to belong to anyone. Most people don't get a choice on where or when they're born, yet where and when they are born often determines where they can go. You have to ask for permission to go to places. And when you go to places, you have to follow rules and laws you didn't vote for or against, they are decisions that were completely made without any say from you. So I don't think it's fair for anyone to call dibs on the moon. It's not so much that it belongs to everyone as it's it shouldn't belong to anyone in particular. 

&gt;it seems extra strange to just assume that the moon shouldn't be owned

Well, to you. To me it's strange to assume that it should belong to anyone. 

Antarctica doesn't belong to anyone according to the Antarctic Treaty. Svalbard technically belongs to Norway but everyone's allowed to use it. 

And The Declaration of Legal Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Uses of Outer Space  adopted by the UN in 1963 said that:

&gt;All space exploration will be done with good intentions and is equally open to all States that comply with international law. No one nation may claim ownership of outer space or any celestial body.

&gt; After Nazi Germany's invasion of the Second Polish Republic in September 1939, many members of the German minority (around 25%[12]) joined the ethnic German paramilitary organisation Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz. When the German occupation of Poland began, the Selbstschutz took an active part in Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles. Due to their pre-war interactions with the Polish majority, they were able to prepare lists of Polish intellectuals and civil servants whom the Nazis selected for extermination. The organisation actively participated and was responsible for the deaths of about 50,000 Poles.[13]

&gt; During the German occupation of Poland during World War II (1939-1945), the Nazis forcibly resettled ethnic Germans from other areas of Central Europe (such as the Baltic states) in the pre-war territory of Poland.

Some German tourists decided to do the same thing at the Russian border. They later said that they knew it was a crime, but they didn't consider it very serious, because they were used to open borders.  

The Germans drove to a border-crossing place and walked past the warning signs into the restricted border zone. After walking a few kilometres they arrived to the borderline. They crossed the border into Russia, and stayed there for six minutes, taking selfies. Then they returned to Finland.

Court trial has started in case of murder of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancee. In testimonies, some of the accomplices mentioned several politicians as having close ties to the guy accused of ordering the murder. 

Next morning, former attorney general was arrested on charges of abuse of power - a video of him talking about blackmailing politicians was found during the murder investigation, in the safe box of the alleged mastermind behind the murder. Former attorney general was released from police custody the next day and there are speculations whether his arrest was orchestrated to divert attention from alleged murderers of Kuciak naming politicians in court.

For those interested in the Kuciak murder trial, here are links to a couple of summary articles in english:

5530,"&gt; The small farms will just die off or get sucked up by big multi nationals

Well, some will probably become industrial farms.  Some will probably just result in imports of food.

&gt; who then buy themselves with donations new subsidies

Well, if it turns out that some form of corruption shows up that produces a policy other than the one being proposed, then, sure, I can see that being problematic.  But one could say that about any policy.

&gt; Food security is national security after all it is more important than any aircraft carrier.

The UK is not self-sustaining in food even with the farm subsidies that exist today.  I don't know, maybe if she just grew the most land-efficient stuff (e.g. everyone in the UK went vegetarian or something) and she threw even more money than she has been at farms she could be, but realistically, the UK will import food from abroad.  So that's not really the question at hand -- subsidizing farms isn't going to produce a situation where this is at issue.

Further:

* She's a well-to-do country, so she has a great deal of ability to pull food from the global market.  A lot of the world will be starving before Britons start.

* I have a hard time seeing a world where the UK is blockaded (and actually, there that aircraft carrier *would* be handy).  Food is a commodity, and without a blockade -- that is, depriving a country of the ability to *transport* food in, *a la* World War II, it's hard to deprive a country of food, since food is fungible.

* The countries that *would* potentially have the kind of ability to cut into a food supply are also countries most-unlikely to do so in the UK's case.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_power

    &gt;In international politics, food power is the use of agriculture as a means of political control whereby one nation or group of nations offers or withholds commodities from another nation or group of nations in order to manipulate behavior. Its potential use as a weapon was recognised after OPEC‚Äôs earlier use of oil as a political weapon. Food has a major influence on political actions of a nation. In response to acts of food power, a nation usually acts in the interest of its citizens to provide food.
    &gt;
    &gt; Food power is an integral part of the politics of food. The idea of food power is used in embargoes, employment, and food politics. In order for a nation to utilize food power effectively, the nation must effectively apply and display scarcity, supply concentration, demand dispersion, and action independence. The four main nations that export enough agriculture to be able to exert food power are the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/eqlxdd/united_kingdom_to_embark_on_agricultural/feuenph/,duisThias,1579385813

It's also not like Netflix doesn't add more and more international content; series like *Dark* and *La Casa de Papel* have been very successful on their platform, and I'm sure they realise the potential that non-US content has, which is all the more important as competition in the sector increases. 

So, there is no reason to suspect that they won't add more of it, but finding or developing it takes time. The US simply has the largest ecosystem with a very deep pool of talent for producing content. The UK is probably a distant 2nd, while everyone else is even further behind. Try to find any actually good German series. Almost everything we make for TV is just incredibly mediocre shlock. Only in the last few years have we started to see premium productions like the aforementioned *Dark* (funded by Netflix) and *Babylon Berlin* (funded by the ARD and Sky) that have the necessary funding and creative freedom to make something that can actually compete with the quality of US productions.

&gt;**The prosecutor's office is completing the investigation into the brutal murder in Czarli≈Ñskiego Street in Torun. Before Tatiana W. died, she was tortured. The torturers cut off her fingers, ripped out her earrings, cut her throat, nose and ears.** Who do you have to be to torment the victim like that?
This is to be answered by the investigators after four weeks of judicial and psychiatric observation. - It's been submitted to all those who are associated with the crime. And these are: recidivists Arkadiusz K. and Dariusz P., whom we accuse of murder with special cruelty, and Magdalena K. who we accuse of obstructing the investigation by destroying evidence - says prosecutor Bartosz Wieczorek, deputy head of the District Prosecutor's Office of Torun Centre West.

&gt;It was a brutal murder - Tatiana's sister told the journalists. - **She had her mouth cut, her nose torn, her ears torn, her throat slit. She was robbed. Earrings were torn. unable to remove the rings, her fingers were cut off...**

The former was also found guilty of abusing another woman with whom he was associated and possessing amphetamine and illegal ammunition. **Both defendants were sentenced by the court to 25 years' imprisonment** with the reservation that **they will be able to apply for early release only after serving 20 years** - informs ""Gazeta Wyborcza"".

And your comment here doesn't even reply to what I said. You haven't even explained why the Republic wouldn't have gone through the marxist, revolutionary road had it won the war and established itself as a stable regime.

Europe was in a civil war between communists, anarchists and other leftists, and nationalists. Spain was another stage in that war.

1.-Marxism equals stalinism (the soviet union at the time of the spanish civil war).

2.-PSOE equals marxism which equals stalinism.

3.-PSOE (or the republican side) gained help from the Soviet Union because of their condition of stalinists.

This is not correct. 

You need to see, or at least consider, the help from the USSR as an attempt to gain spheres of influence and or combat training for the upcoming WWII (as well as money, since their ""help"" was not [cheap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_gold_(Spain)) at all), and the acceptance from the republican side as the only help they could get in a situation of a devastating war against the ""moorish side"" supported (with interests of course) by the nazis and fascist Italy.

That said the stalinist part of the republican side was always a minority, a minority that gained power through their ""We only have help from the Soviets"" card, up to a point they ended up influencing some govern decissions.

5817,"The Proclamation of the German Empire¬†(18 January 1871) is the title of several¬†historical paintings¬†by the German painter¬†Anton von Werner.
On 18 January 1871, Anton von Werner was present at the proclamation of the¬†German Empire¬†in¬†Versailles¬†in his capacity as a painter. In the following years, he produced several versions of the imperial proclamation at greater intervals, two of which were shown in prominent places in¬†Berlin. Only a third version was preserved to¬†Otto von Bismarck's last residence,¬†Friedrichsruh, and is now open to the public. It is the most reproduced picture of the¬†Imperial Proclamation.
Since the three paintings show strong differences, the images are of great documentary and historical dichotomy. Von Werner obviously adapted them to the wishes of his respective clients. The clothes worn by Bismarck in the first painting do not match with the other two paintings. Bismarck is wearing his white parade uniform in the second and third painting, which places him in the focus of the viewer. In fact, in Versailles, he was wearing a blue gun coat. In addition, he was holding the Order of¬†Pour le M√©rite¬†on his white uniform, which he received in 1884. Minister of War¬†Albrecht von Roon, who did not participate in the proclamation of Versailles, was also included in the third version. In the first, second, and third paintings, the¬†Grand Duke of Baden¬†summons the new emperor. The perspective makes it appear that the imperial proclamation was above all a work of the princes and of the military.
Von Werner began working on the picture as one of the most active and influential German artists.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/eqeil7/in_1871_the_german_states_were_unified_into_the/fesacx9/,Hematophagian,1579363199

The Second Spanish Republic happened in a time where Europe was in a civil war between fascism and communism. The SCW was not only a civil war, but a proxy war between European powers too.

OP said that the Republican side of the SCW was made up mostly by democrats. That's false. Even if both sides weren't homogeneous (neither were the nationalists, which were a mix of rightwing republicans, carlists, monarchists, falangists, etc.), the republican side, especially at the time of the SCW, was made up predominantly by both communists and anarchists. The PSOE, main leftist party during the Republic, was undeniably marxist, the Republican Constitution of 1931 called Spain a 'democracy of workers', etc.

5875,"&gt;Since 2013, reforms in Turkey have been backsliding. Particularly since the July 2016 military coup attempt, Turkey‚Äôs resort to a state of emergency and extensive suspensions, dismissals and detentions has undermined Turkey‚Äôs position vis-√†-vis the EU. These repressive post-coup measures, which the Turkish government defended as anti-terror measures, have affected the whole spectrum of Turkish society: Judiciary, police, gendarmerie, army, civil service, academia, teachers, lawyers, the media and the business community

5876,"facial recognition is neither good or bad. Banning it is bad because now if someone will use it he will not want to disclose it. If something is legal it is easier to control it and make sure there is no misuse.  

&gt;Exceptions to the ban could be made for security projects 

And with this cities could introduce this as ""security project"" and people who visit it will have no idea about it. Making that you have to make signs ""facial recognition in this area"" without exceptions would be much better and would make people more aware about it. 

On top of that it will be hard do develop it, hard to get a lot of data, hard to train AI and therefore get worse results and more false positives.

&gt;as well as research and development.

Good look making research when you cant properly test it. Some drugs are also banned you can get exempt for research but it is not easy. 

Just wait till in 5-years ban will be lifted, there will be no EU-homed technology and technology will be bought from US or China (with inherent risk of leaking data from these systems outside of EU). 

&gt;""a sound methodology for assessing the impacts of this technology and possible risk management measures could be identified and developed"".

imagine if this would be done for more technologies because there is change of misuse and abuse. 

&gt;photos of false matches are kept for weeks

this is just fear mongering. In my city monitoring records are kept for 30 days already. So now a police man will have to be paid and do it slowly. 

using AI for this is much better because AI can do it faster and AI will not laugh at someone photos or put them over internet.

You're just salty cause your land/islands don't give you more EEZ.

We all know what ""trying to find middle ground with Turkey means"". Greece would give away some of the EEZ that it's entitled to, Turkey would get more than it's entitled to and turkey would be happy. But why should Greece bargain with that? That's like you having a small house, your neighbor having a mansion and asking to bargain so you will find middle ground. Why should he agree?
