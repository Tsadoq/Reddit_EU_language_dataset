Nope. It's entirely for internal consumption. Refugees and migrants are one of Erdogan's greatest political liabilities. Even his most fierce supporters want them gone. And there is a potential new wave of refugees from Idlib, so in order to convince the Turks that at least some of the refugees are leaving he makes up those imaginary numbers. It might also be the number of refugees/immigrants in the no man's land. So he might just be counting every refugee who left the Turkish borders. But he presents them as refugees that entered Greece.

117,"Translation (Google translate):

University Hospital Brno faces cyber attack, computers do not work in it. The information was first brought by the server iDnes.cz, confirmed by Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (YES). He was informed about the situation by Jaroslav Šmíd, who now manages the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (NÚKIB). The attack also affected the Children's Hospital and Obstetrics Center in the Cereal Market. The second St. Anne's University Hospital in Brno, due to the attack on Bohunice University Hospital Brno, postponed all planned operations in order to take care of patients with acute problems. Municipal hospitals are also being prepared.

&amp;#x200B;

Problems seemed to have begun at night, and a spokesman for the hospital, Pavel Žára, said the situation was being resolved. Patients with current problems transport ambulances to other hospitals in Brno and the South Moravian Region. Computers with patient data do not work in the teaching hospital, the machine staff must not turn on the machine - and this also paralyzes the ambulance.

&amp;#x200B;

The hospital also analyzes samples taken from people suspected of being infected with a new type of coronavirus. According to Žára, he collects subscriptions from about 20 people a day. But they will not remain without results. ""We will send subscriptions to Ostrava,"" the spokesman explained.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the spokesperson for Žára does not have more information about the attack yet - and NÚKIB representatives will also buy them. “I can confirm that we have the information. We are in place and we are solving it. But we have nothing closer at the moment, ”said Robert Kahofer, Director of the NÚKIB Director's Cabinet.

&amp;#x200B;

Mayor of Brno Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said both municipal hospitals, the Trauma Hospital and the Hospital of the Merciful Brothers, are preparing to receive patients from the University Hospital if their transport is needed.

&amp;#x200B;

St. Anne's University Hospital is also ready to postpone the planned operations. ""We have also strengthened the services at selected departments and clinics until further notice,"" said the spokesperson of the St. Anne's Hospital, Dana Lipovská.

&amp;#x200B;

# Hackers have already attacked hospitals in Benesov and Genoa

This is not the first hacker attack on a domestic medical facility. In early December, the Russian computer virus Ryuk paralyzed the operation of the Benešov hospital when it attacked its computer system. Due to the attack could not start any device, including a computer network, the planned operations had to cancel the hospital. Operation resumed on 30 December.

&amp;#x200B;

In June two years ago, a hacker also attacked a computer network in a lung hospital in Genoa, Rokycany. He encrypted the data, the hospital couldn't access it for several days.

234,"Here’s a[timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_2019–20_coronavirus_pandemic_in_December_2019_–_January_2020) according to Wikipedia. And this just in: [first case was on November 17](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/first-covid-19-case-happened-in-november-china-government-records-show-report).

So for about a month doctors saw cases of an unexplained pneumonia. On December 12, Chinese state television first broadcast news about a new viral outbreak. On December 21st the first cluster of patients is investigated. On the 24th their genome is sequenced, and on the 26th it’s identified as a new corona virus. On the 31st it’s made public.

The dialogue by Dr Li that you’re mentioning, was on December 30th. He indeed spoke before it was public, and obviously the government did not like that. That’s not a great look indeed, but it’s not as if Li had been trying to out a government secret for months. He just wasn’t the one authorized to do so, and spoke before an organized response was given. 

In the West they wouldn’t like that either. They might not make you sign a confession and slap you around a bit, but it will hurt your career. 

Might it have gone more ‘perfect’? For sure. But hospitals see unexplained cases all the time, especially of pneumonia. Medicine is not a cut and dried field. They were alert enough, and capable enough, to detect this within a month. Politically, once the threat had been established, they acted swiftly and effectively.

Looking back, it’s easy to spot and judge what they did wrong. We now know the contagiousness of this virus - they did not. They thought it was SARS(-1), which would not have spread this fast. We now know it’s a novel virus - they did not. They thought they knew what they were dealing with. Medicine in the real world is messy.

Only once those facts became clear, was it possible to mount a targeted response. Hindsight is 20/20. And here we are.",European abroad,/r/europe/comments/fhk08p/corona_a_note_from_germany/fkdmm6k/,TheFluffiestOfCows,1584085043

I mean, I know from the EU ECB single-mandate/US Fed dual-mandate back-and-forth during the financial crisis that the ECB's real goal is keeping inflation within a target range.  And that's not really trying to keep bond yields the same across the Eurozone, at least directly.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank#Mandate_and_inflation_target

&gt; The primary objective of the European Central Bank, set out in Article 127(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, is to maintain price stability within the Eurozone.[56] The Governing Council in October 1998[57] defined price stability as inflation of under 2%, “a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%” and added that price stability ”was to be maintained over the medium term”. (Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices)[58] Unlike for example the United States Federal Reserve System, the ECB has only one primary objective—but this objective has never been defined in statutory law, and the HICP target can be termed ad hoc. 

But then:

&gt;Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the Treaty also states that ""the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Union with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Union"".[60]

Hmm.  Maybe this explains why Baptists, Lutherans, and Methodists were okay with individual cups of sacramental wine.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transubstantiation

&gt; The Eastern Catholic, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox Churches, along with the Assyrian Church of the East, agree that in a valid Divine Liturgy bread and wine truly and actually become the body and blood of Christ. In Orthodox confessions, the change is said to start during the Liturgy of Preparation and be completed during the Epiklesis.

-

&gt; Lutherans explicitly reject transubstantiation[84] believing that the bread and wine remain fully bread and fully wine while also being truly the body and blood of Jesus Christ.

-

&gt; Methodists believe in the real presence of Christ in the bread and wine (or grape juice) while, like Anglicans and Lutherans, rejecting transubstantiation.

http://www.ntbt.org/Believe.html

&gt; Baptists do not believe in the Roman Catholic view of “transubstantiation” which claims that the Catholic priests “transform” the bread and cup into the literal body and blood of Christ.
&gt;
&gt;Baptists do not believe in the Lutherans view of “consubstantiation” which claims the “real presence” of the Lord in a “special way.”

Just look at what happened in the US yesterday. The Fed decided to pump 1,5$ trillions into the market, and the only thing it accomplished was a bounce from the day lows, that was immediately touched again in less than an hour.

As for her declaration regarding the spread, she shouldn’t have mentioned it, because markets clearly reacted to what she said and that’s a problem for countries too indebted, but just because she shouldn’t have said it doesn’t mean that she’s wrong.

The bulk of the media, punditry, and podcasts have talked a lot about the following.

The week that Bernie became the front runner after Nevada he did three things that made him immediately fall on his face leading up to South Carolina.

1) When asked by mainstream media to clarify if he was a Democratic Socialist, he said absolutely.  If you want to win the election in the US the correct answer is ""FDR New Deal Democrat"" because that's what most independent think Democratic Socialism is.

2) He did the whole ""Mussolini made the trains run on time"" thing with Fidel Castro and Cuba.  Broad sections of the American population alive when JFK was in office during the Cuban Missile Crisis find this unacceptable.  It also guaranteed that he reverse his trends with Hispanic/Latino voters and lose Florida.

3) His healthcare plan eliminates private insurance (announced early in the primaries) and then once he became a front runner he announced a desire to ban fracking.  I'm biased and work in insurance, but I felt like you could take on one industry -- but not two.  There are simply too many communities with ties to both for that to work, and in particular it was going to lose him Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Lose Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida and there is no path through the electoral college to victory.  Winning 100% of the vote in California and New York doesn't matter.

I'm also not African American, but a lot of political scientist types describe that demographic as a community movement ""have you personally met people like me"" mindset.  A white dude living in Vermont is not the strongest platform when you have ""Obama's Vice President"" on the ballot.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/fh87jm/us_suspends_travel_to_europe_for_30_days/fkda0bu/,Kegheimer,1584072237
432,"We actually know the story. The pandemic is the result of the criminally incompetent and corrupt CCP, who found the time and resources to silence Chinese doctors trying to warn about this new strain, but not to close the Wuhan market early on and institute some basic measures to contain the virus.

For at least a couple of weeks, they allowed people to carry on as normal and travel wherever they wanted. They allowed more than 10,000 families to take part in a Lunar Year banquet in Wuhan, even though they knew that a flu-like illness was spreading and that allowing a public event of this size was massively irresponsible.

HIV is a red herring, I'm afraid. This virus was sequenced and classified almost immediately. It might be new, but it belongs to a known family and the basics were understood from the beginning, even though the finer details will take time to be fully understood. 

China has plenty of capable scientists and medical personnel, so the government should have listened to them and allowed them to consult with others across the world at an early stage. Containment strategies could have been implemented without panic because initially they would have involved only a relatively small area and number of people.

Now the same situation is playing out in the US. Why? Because both countries are ruled by authoritarian idiots who disregard the informed opinions of scientists and who are busy papering over the cracks because they know their political standing is fragile.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/fhk08p/corona_a_note_from_germany/fkda9gj/,Hangry_Squirrel,1584072431

In addition to this subways, buses and common gathering places are getting cleaned and disinfected regulary in big cities for 4 weeks now. I cannot talk for every city but AFAIK Istanbul and Ankara definitely does this.


These are all standard stuff, nothing special but they were still getting done. They probably made some difference. Also Turkey isn't really a big destination for Chinese tourists so that was another factor. Another important factor was Iranian spread for Turkey and they also responded quick enough to that it seems.


We probably had/have more cases than one. Even health minister himself stated that the virus is most definitely in the country. However there is no pandemic.

After following how the virus is spreading globally, and realizing that the information given by the government is not at all transparent, I contacted my university’s email designated for expressing concerns over the virus. This email Address was however not real, it did not receive a message and returned to me by the email provider (of Uni) 

Their main claim was “we are following the instructions of dutch authorities”, meaning the RIVM. They apparently have only tested 1 person per family at risk of infection, and only those that require extensive medical treatment are counted by this organization. For me this shows they have no idea how many people are infected and are manipulating the results to avoid people taking matters into their own hands.


This is however not a problem that only the “authorities” can deal with. It is everyone’s responsibility to act. Everyone had to take matters into their own hands. If you feel the risk is not worth it (what is more valuable than stopping a global health crisis) then stay at home. Yesterday the #staythefuckhome was a good message. 

It is not about if I will get sick or die. You probably will. It is about making sure the medical system is not overwhelmed and for everyone to take responsibility in limiting the epidemic.

So it’s useless).

And our government always, always says that wearing face mask is unnecessary, that only sick people have to wear one. Our chief executive (just like the prime minister of Hong kong) even said if she sees a civil servant wear a face mask, she would ask him to put it off.

But guess what? No one trusts the government at all! All of us (at least 99%) wear face mask when out. There was a severe shortage of face masks in the market ard a month ago. To combat the shortage, the CEO of an online shop and a famous chemistry tutor worked together to invent and manufacture a face mask that can be reused for multiple times.

The community voluntarily create posters and videos to educate people on sanitation, self-hygiene, eg proper way of washing hands and wearing/disposing of a face mask. They circulate these posters on Facebook and Instagram, and even (illegally) post them on the walls of shopping malls and housing estates (that used to be filled with protest information and bloody images of police brutality).

I think all of these acts and mentality can be attributed to the public’s complete distrust and disillusionment towards the government over the past nine months because of the series of protests triggered by the extradition law.

587,"&gt; I hope that this event will not lead to the EU, the world becoming more fragmented and hostile.

I think this event will trigger precisely the contrary. For example, if you listen to today's (13 Mars) Macron's speech you realize he said a few things that may matter and hint at some changes:
* He said that coronavirus is a global problem and for that reason it's not the time for creating division between countries (this was aimed at Trump and his policies I believe).
* He also said that this epidemic is showing that basic life things like food and healthcare mustn't be at the mercy of economic powers.

The last statement may hint at several things but in my opinion it means we need a more united and stronger Europe that is not dependent on foreign powers. This Epidemic has shown, for example, what happens when essential medical equipment is imported from overseas (China in this case). It's also showing that decisions on how to handle the epidemic made abroad (USA) are affecting Europe.

This epidemic is waking up people to the fact that the current neoliberal capitalism is a failed model.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/fhk08p/corona_a_note_from_germany/fkd19ls/,livinginahologram,1584065938

I hope the Spanish government learns something from the example, and from the Italian example in Lombardy, and the Chinese example in Wuhan and Hubei, and locksdown the Madrid Autonomous Comunity.

Wuhan was lockdown was anounced when there only 571 cases in China. Right now there are 1388 cases in Madrid. 56 deaths. And nothing has been done.

Yesterday there was an international football match between Atlético de Madrid and Liverpool and 3000 At. de Madrid supporters were allowed by both Spanish and British authorities to flight there and attend the match¹. I think this is irresponsible.

If the Chinese government would have allowed 3000 cititzens to flight to another country, from Wuhan, when there were 1388 cases in Wuhan, everbody around the world would have been attacking both them and the country accepting the visitors. Here in Europe nothing happens.

&gt;""This too shall pass"" (Persian: این نیز بگذرد‎, romanized: īn nīz bogzarad) is a Persian adage translated and used in multiple languages. It reflects on the temporary nature, or ephemerality, of the human condition. The general sentiment is often expressed in wisdom literature throughout history and across cultures, although the specific phrase seems to have originated in the writings of the medieval Persian Sufi poets such as Rumi. 

-

&gt; Attar records the fable of a powerful king who asks assembled wise men to create a ring that will make him happy when he is sad. After deliberation the sages hand him a simple ring with the Persian words ""This too shall pass"" etched on it, which has the desired effect to make him happy when he is sad. It also, however, became a curse for whenever he is happy.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/fhp165/get_ready_for_fortress_europe/fkcmzwo/,duisThias,1584056588

If the Chinese CDC determines that a contagion is present, then they inform the central government, which has the authority to issue quarantine orders. The Chinese CDC began its investigation on 29 December, and on 20 January, the investigation determined that human-to-human transmission was possible. The central government issued quarantine orders from 29 January.

In all of this, there was never an attempt to 'ignore' the contagion. There was public censorship, but it had little effect on the government response: the government responded because the Chinese CDC determined that human-to-human transmission was possible, not because of public backlash. Further, the public panic that may have come without censorship could have spread the disease further.

Perhaps the 21-day duration of the investigation can be criticized, but in order to do that, it would have to be shown that the Chinese CDC responded more slowly than others would have.

725,"&gt;I don’t see how a screen replacement can alter a payment in any way?

It does when the array of cameras that serve as authentication are integrated onto screen module because they'd occupy more space otherwise, and most people happily pay that cost (me included).

Various companies tried to make chunky, even modular, phones be a thing, and they all failed miserably.

&gt;Also, hardware is one thing but the software will eventually be the one that let the payment go trough or not.



If you trust random hardware you don't have physical security, period.

&gt;In no way by changing the hardware will alter with software decisions, otherwise it would’ve already been done.

Biometric authentication on iOS and MacOS is done in separated hardware, and doing firmware updates for that kind of thing is not nearly as easy as patching the user-space of the operative system.

_Ideally_, it should be impossible.

&gt;If I buy any kind of product, it’s my right to do with it what I want.

No, you don't buy iOS nor the T2 firmware, they're not selling it to you (and you certainly don't have enough money to buy them).

They're licensing them to you so you can use them, but it's their software, period.

751,"&gt; Yes, I get that. And even though an international travelban is heavily overrated as a preventative measure I have no doubt US state and federal officials will leave no stone unturned to get things back under control.


If it’s heavily overrated then why is every country doing it?


&gt; My point is that the US citizenry has historically been more sceptical of governmental intervention than the European mainland folks are. And during a time of crisis when health care officials need everyone's cooperation that can have problematic consequences.


I get that point, but it’s a cliched and not true point. It’s not like the country can quarantine itself without government intervention. By the logic you’re taking the US wouldn’t even have much police forces if the country was was wary about government intervention to control crime, and yet the US has very large and militarized police forces.


If a quarantine is going to happen then the government is the entity which imposes quarantines. That’s just common sense. Unless you think the US population at large doesn’t understand how quarantines work. To which is would say, if the US population were that stupid then the US would be a much poorer country than it is today.

836,"Personal space varies by country.  I read something on it a while back.  Finland and Scandinavia are towards the ""more space"" end of the scale.  Italians tend toward the ""less space"" end.

IIRC, Latin America tends to favor less space, and us in the US tend to be somewhat-more space than them, but not as much as Scandinavia.

It's sort of a problem, because people in ""less space"" countries feel that it's being cold, impersonal, and unfriendly to move away, and people in ""more space"" countries feel that it's uncomfortably-intimate, getting closer to sexual, to get up close and personal.

I remember an newly-immigrated Italian-American coworker that I had once, and it took a while for me to get used to all the close proximity and physical contact.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxemics

&gt;Personal space is highly variable, due to cultural differences and personal preferences. On average, preferences vary significantly between countries. A 2017 study[14] found that personal space preferences with respect to strangers ranged between more than 120 cm in Romania, Hungary and Saudi Arabia, and less than 90 cm in Argentina, Peru, Ukraine and Bulgaria. 
&gt;
&gt;The cultural practices of the United States show considerable similarities to those in northern and central European regions, such as Germany, Scandinavia, and the United Kingdom. Greeting rituals tend to be the same in Europe and in the United States, consisting of minimal body contact—often confined to a simple handshake. The main cultural difference in proxemics is that residents of the United States like to keep more open space between themselves and their conversation partners (roughly 4 feet (1.2 m) compared to 2 to 3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) in Europe).[15]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/fhkqhd/for_a_moment_i_felt_like_i_was_in_finland/fkbxd8g/,duisThias,1584041697

838,"You're probably right. I've tried finding objective sources outside of my bubble, but it is hard to get a clear picture.

I don't have a problem with Biden winning the nomination and I acknowledge that his political views have more support from the majority of democrats.  
It has taken me some time to understand that Sanders' proposed plans seem a good progressive step from a Western EU point of view, but the spirit and philosophy of the United States are different. What Sanders proposes is a radical leap leftward from the norm, and I would be as hesitant about a similarly large leap from my status quo.

But, respectfully, I disagree. You cannot convince me that the different pictures the mainstream media paint of Biden and Sanders are representative of the difference in their respective political views. I'm not saying Sanders would have won a fair fight: his ideas are further from the norm, after all.

864,"I don’t think anybody can expect ‘perfect’ here, not from China, nor from anyone else. 

We don’t know the story here of course, but at the very least you’d have to allow for the complexity of the issue. Identifying an unknown pathogen so soon after its first occurrence is not a mean feat. I’m not sure the West would have done a better job - in fact, I don’t think it would have. 

And of course, you can’t go around and announce to the world that there’s a new virus unless you have proof for that. And not just that, you need to proof that the virus you found is indeed what’s making your patients sick. Then you want to find out how dangerous it is, where it came from and how it works. You don’t want to spread panic for nothing, so you shut up until you’re absolutely sure. 

You can call that irresponsible, and maybe time will tell that it was. But I don’t see much evidence for that. 

To compare, HIV probably was around for at least a century before we diagnosed it as the pathogen to a new disease. Then it took years and years to understand the virus. Then many years more before some medication was found, and then a lot more years before we found treatments that made it chronic. Meanwhile, millions died. It’s still not curable. 

That was the 1980s and 1990s. We’ve come a long way since. But this is highly complex stuff, and it doesn’t lend itself well to armchair judgement, just to assign blame.",European abroad,/r/europe/comments/fhk08p/corona_a_note_from_germany/fkbxth9/,TheFluffiestOfCows,1584041942

“We see that those who try to lecture Turkey on human rights and democracy over the Armenian issue and fight against terror have a bloody history,” Erdoğan said, adding that Turkey’s rulers for centuries expanded its borders of influence by  “conquering hearts.”

“Those who today wear the mask of human rights and democracy apostles are responsible for the biggest massacres humanity has witnessed in recent centuries. Neither Turks nor the Muslims are responsible for the killing of four million people in the period of crusaders,” Erdoğan said.

The Turkish president criticised France for lecturing Turkey today, while having killed 800,000 people in Rwanda 25 years ago.

1210,"No, evidence suggests the contrary. I base this comment on:

1) Iranian authorities actively hid the outbreak in its early stages, as they did not want to call off the elections (which were held, predictably worsening the situation). While already half a dozen countries detected infected individuals coming from Iran, Iranian authorities claimed there were only a dozen cases in Qom.

2) Iran had more cases than Italy until a few days ago. Iran did not take containment action on the same level of severity as Italy, yet somehow they claim they have less cases now.

3) Multiple opposition and international news sources have been claiming that the death toll is higher than the on declared for quite some time. A journalist (Mohamad Ahwaze) has been arrested for filming and spreading a video depicting lots of body bags in an Iranian hospital.

4) Iran is an authoritarian country, not exactly known for transparency.

5) Their senior leadership is dropping like flies - they have already lost two MPs, two senior diplomats, a member of the ayatollah's advisory council, high-ranking Army officers - yet they declare less deaths than Italy.

6) They are refusing to provide a breakdown of deaths by province (unlike, for instance, Italy). Why? Because they are making the numbers up.",Norway,/r/europe/comments/fhc9hc/countries_most_affected_by_covid19_and_the_number/fkalkzu/,BallWrecking7,1584012660

A lot of people shit on the EU, because it's supposedly ''not doing anything'' but everyone conveniently forgets that we're not a federation.

If there were an actual institution tasked with screening and keeping a viral outbreak under control, it would've been grand. But sadly we're not there in terms of integration.

1318,"Makes sense, considering the required resources.    

A test takes about 6 hours in the lab and you need both equipment and trained manpower to do them, and then you only get a snapshot of that particular moment.      

A patient that is already infected (a few days ago) does not yet show the detectable virus in the throat sample and can be declared 'clean', while being a source of infection one week later.     

If, as example, you do 1 million tests 'precautionary' and you get 10% positives then you only have ""a number for a spreadsheet"". 
That info does not help in combating the virus or its spreading, but those 6 million hours do cause a big backlog in the lab (getting the results back after 9 days isn't useful).    

If you just wait 1 week (for those 10% to get a fever) then you only need 10% of the lab resources to find out if it is indeed Corona or if the fever has other causes.      
'Other causes' like pneumonia can be treated as usual, but in the case of corona even then the medics can't do anything (yet), ""social distancing"" (self quarantine) is something that everybody should be aware of by now so 80%-ish (the young and fit) can ride it out without hospitalization (time consuming 'testing' is still just another spreadsheet number), only testing the 20% (elderly etc) means very fast lab testing and organizing a hospital bed if needed, as this is the first opportunity where medical staff actually 'can' do something.",Flevoland,/r/europe/comments/fhd9bi/stockholm_region_will_stop_testing_for_corona/fkafdns/,mrCloggy,1584005530

1551,"I doubt any country is going to ""shut down"".  The best you're going to get is part of a country doing so.

In China, Wuhan became *very* restricted, but that was because the rest of the country could supply them with essentials.  I don't think that any country would hit that level at a national scope.

I could imagine seeing public entertainment/restaurants/etc shut down.  Maybe movement controls limiting people to specific areas.  Italy tells people just to go to work or to obtain vital supplies if you aren't at home, and have restricted people from leaving a certain area, but even they aren't ""shut down"".

I do not believe that any country will just tell everyone ""go home"", no matter how bad things get.

If the virus can't be contained -- then people will just get the disease.  Some will be sick, and a bunch of older people will die, with hospitals trying to keep as many as they can alive.  For the vast bulk of people who get it, covid-19 will not mean death.

Okay, maybe airlines can pull some fancy rerouting in a triangle to limit some of the losses, but you get the point -- it's gonna add cost to getting the planes back out of the Schengen Area.

My mothers side of the family has bad stories about what the Bulgarians did to our family etc. so this is probably a underlying theme in hate between cultures. Everything you wrote is just sad and not acceptable not something I condone. Religion does make people do stupid things kinda the reason why I'm not religious anymore.

Turkish people aren't the great we have many assholes just like many nations around there, but I don't think it's fair for someone to blame me or someone else that is Turkish for things that happened in the past (You can definitely disagree with this)

The things you say happened happened in an era where every human was and had been capable of horrible things.  But if it makes you feel any better average modern day Turks would never do or be proud of the things you say had been done if they had been done today (the majority wouldn't at least) I hope they wouldn't at least. My reasoning to continue writing was to kinda make you see that also.

But I'm glad we can kinda come to an understanding and I never heard of someone else story like this so thank you for sharing.

Regarding the parallels I mean yes, some parts I can see how they resemble the past. It's a thin line though where that parallel ends and I think its a dangerous game to not know where that line ends.

Beijing said it was willing to donate to our country one hundred thousand masks of the highest technology, twenty thousand protective suits, as well as fifty thousand swabs to carry out diagnostic tests. But that's not all. The Italian government is preparing to purchase a thousand lung ventilators needed for the intensive care units. These are ready-to-use machines, produced by Chinese companies and of which the Beijing executive - given the drop in infection due to a policy of strict containment - no longer has any need. A useful surplus, however, for our hospitals.

&amp;#x200B;

The operation took place under the direction of Luigi Di Maio, who now has a consolidated relationship with China: the Foreign Minister heard Tuesday morning from his Chinese counterpart and Beijing State Councillor, Wang Yi. A thirty-minute phone call to define the details and give the green light to the operation. From the Chinese side came the guarantee to Di Maio that the Italian orders will be prioritized in order to make up in the shortest possible time for an urgency that now affects several countries. The Chinese government has also invited companies to export two million ordinary medical masks to Italy. The signatures on the contracts should arrive in the next few hours. Di Maio, who also talked about the aid with Minister Roberto Speranza, comments to Corriere: ""Friendship and reciprocal solidarity are pagan"".

Let me expand on what I meant there.

The Balkans are a small area with a diverse range of ethnic groups that will always fight each other, they all claim land that overlaps each other and to a degree have groups that hate the other group in each country. Even when the Turks were there the Balkans were full of wars, if the Turks were not there it would still be full of wars. Yes you are correct most likely the Hungarians would expand in that region if the Ottoman Empire wasn't there. But still the region would be full of wars! Since the Ottoman Turks ruled over the area I only wrote Turks. But I'm sure it would apply for any empire you enter here : \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I'm not saying that Turks brought peace to the Balkans, I'm saying that who ever was in that region it would be a war torn backwards region, maybe the Turks made it worse or made it better I don't know that is arguable and open to interpretation.

_______________________________
So this is what happened recently in Romania.

We have the MAI (that's the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Romania) and we have one retired individual. This retired individual goes to the hospital saying his heart is hurting, the doctors investigate him, but his symptoms don't make much sense. They ask him if he travelled outside the country, he says he didn't.

A bit later he gets severe pneumonia, doctors decide to test him for Co-Vid, it is confirmed the dude is infected. After being questioned again he says he was in Israel, he didn't tell because he didn't want his family to get quarantined for no reason.

Fast forward a bit, his entire family is infected, his wife, his son, his daughter in law, who is pregnant and her 3 year-old girl all infected. The doctor who investigated him for heart problems ? Infected. An entire hospital in quarantine. But on 1st and 8th March we have Martisor and Woman's day, so he and his son gave Martisor or flowers to their female acquaintances and colleagues (usually many women respond with a kiss on the cheek to those they know). Today (11.03.2020) the number of cases in Romania almost doubled, the vast majority being people who had contact with him or his son.

Why did he lie tho ? Don't worry, a woman from the office of population evidence was found, she was with him in Israel and is infected too. It was his lover .... and that's why he didn't want to say he was outside the country, to hide his escapade.

So here you have it, one fuck which resulted in lying to the authorities and starting a pandemic in Bucharest, a criminal file which he received in shockingly fast time (considering where he worked and that his son works for the Romanian Secret Services (SRI), probably some rather high-up people who are now quarantined are quite pissed), an entire hospital quarantined, and doubling the cases of Co-Vid in Romania, countless people who wish he doesn't die from the virus to serve in prison, an endangered family (with 1 very young and 1 unborn child), and a possible divorce.

Does this pass for ""the costliest fuck of the year"" ? :)

Now this is my opinion but I'd love for you to read it and am open to your thoughts on it:

The Balkans is a small region with tons of ethnic groups and some of those ethnic groups are divided by religion also! There are the Greeks,Slavs,Romanians,Albanians and Hungarians. Now we can split the Slavs into three basically the Croats,the Serbs and depending on the era the Bosnians. If you want to go further you can even add the Montenegrin and the Macedonians and I'm sure there may be some groups that I don't even know of.

But let's say it's 7 different ethnic groups trying to get ahead of the other one constantly in the region. They all have overlapping claims on the area also so border clashes would be constant between them. Constant war is never good for a country. Now lets add to the situation of the nations around the Balkans that had/have their eyes on the Balkans. There is Italy to the west. Austrians and Poles to the north, Russians to the North-east and lets say Turks don't exist so in this scenario it'd be either Greeks,Persians,Arabs,Armenians or Kurds from the South-East. All of these nations would be much larger because they had other options to expand into before eyeing the Balkans. Don't get me wrong, the people of the Balkans are not weak at all the Turks were just able to expand east then attack the Balkans at their weakest to conquer it. So either way the Balkans would always have an Empire ready to just jump in.

The only nation I could see growing big enough to be a powerhouse in the Balkans are the Western Slavs (Croats,Bosnians,Serbs,Slovenes etc.) but then again here we are even if the Turks didn't convert Bosnians the great schism in Christianity would divide Western Slavs which it did and Turks and Islam just divided it even further.",Turkish-American,/r/europe/comments/fgxw0a/a_turkish_patrol_boat_deliberately_collided_with/fk9895r/,NanisYak,1583970752

They didn't want to hurt the CCP's feelings. They even claimed China's response was commendable despite the fact China's censoring has unquestionably caused increased infections, deaths, and spread. On top of this, China is insisting Taiwan be excluded from WHO planning, and the WHO capitulated. This also has increased the risk to Taiwanese people and helps ensure increased infections there. 

The WHO's pandering is pathetic and has put all of us at greater risk.

That's by choice, not because trains are Inherently more expensive.

First up, we can't tell them to make sacrifices we ourself don't make. 

Second up, China and India are the world's factories, without our consumption they would not operate at that scale, it is our choice to buy from cheaper sources like them, and thus a large part of that pollution is our choice, we cheap out and buy from there, can't blame that on them.

2098,"&gt;These trees would be much more beneficial for the planet than your wind farms.

Hmm... I wonder.

Apparently wind power has a median, life cycle output of 11 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour  if you are taking a conservative estimate in 2018.

Scotland has around 7800MW of installed onshore wind, but obviously that isn't generating all the time at a consistent level. However between January and July of 2019 we know that Scotland generated 9,831,320 megawatt hours of wind energy, about 90% of which was onshore generation.

So 90% of 9,831,320 mwh would be 8,848,188 mwh, or 8,848,188,000 kwh. Which means wind power generation in Scotland between those periods produced about 97,330,068,000g of carbon dioxide, or 97,330 tonnes of carbon dioxide.

However combined cycle gas generation produces around 490g of carbon dioxide per kwh. So if Scotland hadn't built that wind infrastructure and instead stuck with gas generation, we'd have instead seen 4,335,612 tonnes of carbon dioxide produced by energy generation.

That's 4,238,282 tonnes of carbon dioxide not dumped in the atmosphere because of the wind generation in place..

But how does that compare to what a tree can capture and sequester? Well that seems to depend on the type of tree, time of year, the age and who you listen to, but to take a reasonable figure, 25kg of carbon dioxide a year seems to be a decent average. But we are looking at 6 month generation figures, so lets go with 12.5kg of carbon dioxide per tree over that 6 month period.

14 million trees would then have offset 175,000,000 kg of carbon dioxide, or rather 175,000 tonnes. That is dwarfed by the amount of carbon dioxide not pumped into the atmosphere by wind generation over gas..

So it would seem from a cursory glance that Scottish wind generation has, at least in terms of carbon emissions, a much larger benefit than the trees that were cut down to enable it. In fact you'd have needed 339,062,560 to offset the same amount (24x the number cut down..).

2106,"This was mainly because Turkey was in a very bad shape due to what followed after the collapse of Ottoman Empire. Turkey won but with great losses in every department from population to army power to economical power. Which by the way, was a direct result of European greed using colonial forces.

Turkey sold to *both* axis and allies forces. Allies bought even if they did not need though - to lower what Germany is getting.

Turkey was neutral till they couldn't stay neutral (neighbor country allows free passage to Axis forces). Turkey's main cities were especially vulnerable to Axis forces much like Greece - that lost in the blink of an eye.

Maybe if Europe didn't greed the fuck out of this territory, if Bulgaria didn't give free passage so they can invade Greece and have forces all around Turkey, if Turkey had any type of power left, if Italy didn't ally with Germany, if Iraq was not an issue (thanks Britian) things could be different. I can add a lot more IFs here.

Almost as if WWII is not so black and white and the only thing that is funny here is how biased you are.

No, but they're actively lying to refugees and paying their bus ride to bring them to the border, and they physically attack them when they try to get back. They have even directly attacked Greek border police, which could be interpreted as an act of war.

Don't get me wrong: I'm also shocked by many of the comments in this sub on this issue. Many of them are racist and inhumane, and seem to have no respect for the human dignity of the refugees who are now trapped between the two countries.

2230,"To be frank, they... ughm... I guess it depends on the way one identifies itself.

From my own experience they often aren't perceived as Poles in Poland itself due to the linguistic pecularities of their often quite mixed speech (with some words being much closer to Belarusian or, sometimes, even to Lithuanian). I personally think that back in the old times this kind of mixed speech was a norm in these borderlands, not that it matters much today.
The surnames are clearly Belarusian/Polish though.

Again, it is the way one identifies that matters. If one wants to be a Pole — so be it. Same with self-identifying simply as ""locals"" —  first and foremost, it should be seen like an interesting local phenomena. That shouldn't be an obstacle for maintaining larger non-ethnic but civic and political Lithuanian identity. I don't really understand why some people still don't want it to be that way, sometimes even delving into that theory (surprisingly, taken straight out of  local Soviet history books) that these people are Slavicized Lithuanians in order to deny them their right to be whatever they want. Damn, even that attempt to paint a whole group of people who have lived here since God knows when, as an internal enemy, a fifth column — that is indeed pathethic. Something a Russian would do to their minorities like Crimean Tatars or people of North Caucasus. I know it's unpleasant to meet vatniks in real life but have some dignity.

2526,"No, this is a heavy loaded speculation with no truth value.

“Latinization” is rather a propaganda term invented by Hungarians, Russians, Austrians and Germans, that is, those powers who had/have an interest in delegitimizing Romania and the Romanian language.

It is also important to point up that no linguistic “purge” of whatever forms, words, expressions has ever taken place. This too is an invention.

In no possible way was this lexical modernization linked to whatever ideology of “latinization”, which actually didn't ever exist in Romania (except some academic debates in Transylvania).

Please read my comment below, about how lexical modernization worked.

When Traian conquered the land, the Romans established a very big military presence, mostly composed of commoners and the rather large for the time Dacic population who got Romanized really quickly.

Thus, the Romanian identity developed. Romans, but not quite. It's remarkable how only 150ish years of Roman rule shaped everything.

Basically it comes down to two factors, the Romans blitzkrieg-ed their newly conquered province with a lot of people and the existing Dacians were themselves in a way Romanized after decades of fighting the Romans and close contact with the Greek colonies of the Black Sea.",,/r/europe/comments/fgsgac/the_composition_of_the_romanian_language_core/fk6r90o/,giddycocks,1583912644

Another important factor was that despite being under ""foreign"" rule, the territory usually was a vassal territory paying tribute rather than full occupation, allowing it some cultural independence. So instead of the slavs taking over, they got assimilated by the Daco-Romans.

I've been involved with supporting a friend asking for a gender change here in France, and the process is an uphill battle.

2679,"I see the point you're trying to make, but this isn't a matter of personal opinion, really. Just because a language is an inherently organic and ever-evolving construct, doesn't make your personal alteration as legitimate as the established norm.

Language is a communication tool, and as such, it belongs first and foremost to the group. If you, as an individual, stray from the norm formally or informally agreed on by the group, you're on your own. It doesn't **inherently** make your altered spelling/pronounciation wrong (only different), but it makes it wrong for the group, which is all that matters when communication is involved.

While there are exceptions to the *a/h* rule, and while pronounciation can indeed vary, when written, ""*health*"" is always preceded by ""*a*"". That's a constant rule, regardless of your personal take on it. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;If everyone's brain were to freeze because they couldn't understand me, I would probably give it a thought or two about changing it, but if it's only you, it doesn't seem that relevant. 

Just because nobody else is pointing it out to you, doesn't mean it doesn't bother them aswell.

People may be lenient, acknowledge that you're not a native speaker, or simply unwilling to bother you/themselves with it. But you'd be seriously mistaken to interpret that lenience as some kind of enabling validation.

Personally, I wouldn't have said a thing, if this minor detail didn't devolve into a full-blown discussion. I usually don't correct spelling/grammatical mistakes, even in my own language. But as a matter of fact, it *does* bother me, too. And I'm not even a native English speaker (and prone to many mistakes myself). It certainly doesn't freeze my brain, but it's inherently annoying to read a text with orthographic or grammatical mistakes, because they impair and disrupt the flow of reading: you can't help but notice the mistake, when all you want is to focus on the essence of the text itself.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;In the end, I'll speak and write the way it better suits me. As long as I can convene my points, that's alright.

Which is, in my opinion, a staggeringly disrespectful take on communication, and a problem greater than the minor mistake you made.

Ultimately, any text, no matter how badly written, can be deciphered. But it's not the responsibility of your readers to read through your mistakes. That's **your** job to at least *try* to write in a sensible and legible way to begin with.

When people are pointing out that you're spelling a word wrong, **and** you keep doing it nevertheless because ""it suits you"", it's pretty much the equivalent of grossly neglecting your hygiene when you have to spend time with people: it's flat out disrespectful and selfish.

While this particular case may be ridiculously unimportant, the overall problem with that kind of self-centred behaviour is that, when taken further, it turns reading, which should be natural and seamless, into a chore.",France,/r/europe/comments/fgmk9p/british_health_minister_tests_positive_for/fk6rmnp/,Orravan_O,1583913132

2753,"Actually, you couldn't be more wrong.

I have been working tirelessly over the last couple of weeks to ensure that patients who are at risk, as well as those that aren't, don't have to attend one of the biggest hospitals in the UK where it isn't absolutely necessary. We are trying to ensure that patients who need to have a consultation can still do so, without actually coming to the hospital site.

I am absolutely aware that the idea being put in place by some governments is to limit public gatherings, but this doesn't mean that it isn't safe for life to carry on as normal, with a few sensible amendments, for the vast majority of people.

School closures will aid the fact that children can often be an easy way for viruses to spread, but there will also be knock on effects to such a measure. How many of the healthcare professionals will now need to have time off to look after their children? How many children who may have been exposed to the virus already, will now be given to their grandparents for supervision whilst their parents are at work?

You're free to have your opinions, call me selfish, call me names and berate me for still going ahead with a trip to your city. But don't ever accuse me of not caring about high-risk patients, because it's part of my job to ensure that they are cared for in the best possible way given current circumstances.",,/r/europe/comments/fgaztf/czech_republic_closing_schools_banning_events_to/fk6nrn4/,TheDuppyConnoisseur,1583908430

2768,"Thanks for detailed answer and giving me some more insight.

&gt; Judges studied and are paid for to make descisions.

And my concern is that judges are less and less likely to admit: This one is not (yet) covered by any law, so we can't decide on this, it's the task of the people to decide this for next cases (*through legislative branch*).

And that the decision itself is in line with current general opinion or that even opposition law experts are happy with law experts getting more power over government does not change my stance that in this case the judiciary is extending its power to the detriment of the legislative branch, I see no checks and balances able to stop this progress, and I find it very serious threat to democracy. That it is unopposed is of even greater concern. Half of the Europe is looking at Poland prepare to scream again once there is some another progress. But few are connecting the rise of anti-system parties in the west with fading trust in government and democracy which is fueled by such judicial activism.

I understand we come from very different backgrounds and can hardly agree on anything (for example in general I have no respect for people wasting human life, and it does not matter we are talking about their own life).

My point is neither to persuade you that Poland is perfect democracy, nor to persuade you that you should not believe in German democracy (and I know I have no chances here :-)). I think both are basically OK and very far from being authocratic regimes without freedom. 

But you should understand that in other lands there is much less trust in institutions, so people prefer the balance between the branches to give a bit less power to judiciary and a bit more power to government, which can be easily kicked out every four years.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/fgdvv7/germans_and_americans_worlds_apart_on_security/fk6o60q/,janjerz,1583908880

2844,"On really old maps for ships, I understand that the map was functionally something more like a subway map is today -- it's not so critical that the masses shown be exactly proportional to the land.  Instead, it needs to show approximately where land is, where to turn to go up rivers, and where towns are, especially along the coast.  That's what you care about if you're on a ship traveling along coastal waters.  In very old maps, as best I can tell, bays and river mouths tend to be exaggerated in size.  Here's a [1467 map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Ptolemy_Cosmographia_1467_-_world_map.jpg) that shows this more-flagrantly.

That looks to be the case here for Iceland.

I also know that when someone made a map, it wasn't that they personally went out and surveyed all of Europe -- they combined data from earlier maps.

So my layman's guess would be that this mapmaker potentially took data from Iceland for an older map, that there weren't a whole lot of people mapping Iceland back then.  Probably was something of a backwater, not a lot of call to send surveying teams out to get things perfect.

https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/iceland-population/

&gt; The first census of Iceland found a population of more than 50,000 in 1703, which declined to 40,000 after massive eruptions of the Laki volcano between 1783 and 1784.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_Iceland

&gt; Iceland had among the lowest GDP per capita in Western Europe at the start of the 20th century.

So if you figure that Icelanders were at the time probably neither incredibly numerous nor incredibly wealthy, there probably was a limited need to engage in trade with them and thus a limited market for having surveyors go tool around up there gathering better map data.

So it might be an older source of map data.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/fgkd4e/6997_5836_europe_in_1677/fk6fnq4/,duisThias,1583900847

I don't know if you've seen the videos of government workers welding apartment building doors shut for example?

2881,"I'm not familiar with wolfstreet.com, but I seem to vaguely remember them coming up with a lot of rather bearish articles, things that suggest to me that they tend to favor alarmist headlines.

Let's go back a couple years using archive.org to when the site was young.  The headlines on the front page include:

* “There’s no Reason to Panic” about German Miracle Economy: That these comparisons to January 2009 are suddenly cropping up is unnerving. Stocks are rolling over. 

* Credit Bubble Begins to Exact its Pound of Flesh: GT Advanced Tech Soars, Crashes, and Burns :	 Weighed down by soaring debt, it declares bankruptcy. Stock loses 92% in one day. From $20 to $0.80 in 3 months. A harbinger.  

* The US Dollar Is Going to Break Down: Parabolic moves are fun while they last. The problem is they never last. 

* This Chart Shows How Plunging German Factory Orders Sink the Economy: Germany, which is supposed to pull the Eurozone out of its funk, is sinking into a funk of its own. 

* IPO Mania Collapses in Germany: This shouldn’t have happened. Where is the euphoria? 

* Catalonia’s Choice: Chaotic Divorce or Loveless Marriage: In the worst case scenario, financial chaos would ensue, in Madrid and in Catalonia. 

* Kirchner Jumps Off Deep End, Takes Argentina with Her

* “But Analysts Say There’s No Reason to Panic”: After years of Fed-induced market mania, analysts lost the neurological ability to fathom that stocks can actually go down. 

*  Debt Serf Ireland Gets Paid To Borrow Even More: Bizzzaro world of maniacal central banking and crackpot financial engineering. 

* Is Canada Next? Housing Bubble Threatens ‘Financial Stability’: Bank of Canada: it’s so vast and weighed down with so much debt that a “sharp correction in house prices” could take down the financial system. 

* Junk Bond Bubble Cracks, Destroys Stocks One at a Time: Party turns into bloodbath. Happening right now beneath the surface of the S&amp;P 500. 

* Palace Revolt in Eurozone’s Largest Bank: Don Emilio Botín, undisputed Capo of Spanish banking, died. He’d transformed a regional bank into Grupo Santander, one of the world’s biggest baddest megabanks. Now the true owners are getting nervous. 

* Small Investors Flash Warning Sign: They buy near the top and sell near the bottom, getting fleeced at each market swoon. With broader consequences. 

* BofA Merrill Lynch: the Four “Canaries in the Coalmine” Died: They indicate “an inflection point,” as they did in 2008 and 2011. Even relentlessly exuberant VCs are warning.

* Last Time this Happened, the Housing Market Crashed: This chart shows how truly screwed up this housing market really is. 

* Listen to the Slowing US Economy, Hear Echoes of Japan: The consensus of economists never sees a recession until after it begins.

That is a *lot* of ""it's all on the brink of disaster"" articles, spanning quite a bit of the world.  But because we're going back in time, we can enjoy the benefit of reading the articles with foresight and see how well they stack up.  I'd say that the job the site did isn't very good, and it seems to pretty consistently be wrong on the negative side, with very alarmist headlines.

2911,"Does the Orthodox sacrament of Eucharist *mandate* use of a single common cup, or does it permit individual cups?

I've far-more-frequently seen it in individual cups in Lutheranism in the US.

*googles*

It sounds like this was a ritual reform that developed over here:

https://sharperiron.org/article/who-first-adopted-individual-cups-as-regular-communion-practice

&gt;On Sunday morning October 7, 1894, parishioners filled the Bedford Avenue Baptist Church of Brooklyn, New York, in anticipation of experiencing what The New York Times termed a “novelty in communion service” (October 8, 1894). Two newspapers had announced in late September that this church would implement individual cups. The September 28, 1894 issue of The Brooklyn Daily Eagle quoted Bedford’s pastor, J. H. Gunning, as saying that the cups would be used at the next communion service. However, attendees who arrived expecting the individual cups “were disappointed” to see the same old six silver goblets (The New York Times, October 8, 1894). After the service, Rev. Gunning called a business meeting during which he said he was anxious that his church be the first in Brooklyn to use individual communion cups. A majority voted, by standing, to purchase 200 three-inch tall silver cups lined with gold at a cost of thirty-five cents per communicant.
&gt;
&gt;Up until the 1890s, Protestant churches throughout the world used common communion chalices. Some used just one, while others were known to use several in order to administer the fruit of the vine in a time-saving manner. However, churches using multiple chalices still had tens or perhaps hundreds of people sipping from the same cup during a communion service. In the late-nineteenth century, when outbreaks of diphtheria and tuberculosis were common, American sanitarians agitated to reform this religious practice—though no disease contraction had been linked to the use of a common communion chalice.
&gt;
&gt;Reformers proposed several alternatives such as intinction, individual fistulas or siphons, scalloped-rim chalices, and disinfectant cloths. However, among all proposals, individual cups emerged as the most popular method. Enough pastors and laymen became convinced of the sanitary need to use individual cups that the idea took hold, then rapidly spread into the twentieth century. This reform changed what was believed to be an almost 1,900-year-old method.

It isn't your named fault but the fault of a society at large. 

The trauma against these gay people as I have described is about their ability to continue in society, not the literal paperwork someone fills out. How can a person have equal opportunity in businesses if they couldn't even begin at the lowest levels on an equal playing field. People get education in Poland but if someone is severely bullied in school with blind administrators, they couldn't get the same education opportunities as anyone else and so we should expect to see far more of them at an educational disadvantage. If people have no experience in jobs and have no people willing to work for a business owned by a gay person or will invest in such companies and no companies will hire them, they cannot compete in an equal marketplace even if the application form to be in business or acquire property or similar does not include the question of you being gay. Police raids have happened on these gay bars, being a person in the media as being seen like a criminal, that sticks with people and it was done for prejudice not for genuine harm to others. 

And you don't think anyone should have been in a position to stop Hitler in Poland just because it wasn't their problem perhaps? The Polish resistance was a crucial force to end Hitler and the Soviet presence in Poland, it wasn't necessarily their problem or that they were served with a deportation or extermination order. 

Talking to children about masturbation is fine. It's not unhealthy for them to do it and talking to them about it can prevent them from doing stupid things like putting things in their anuses. You might as well not talk to them about their own hair and styling it. And you can teach them to respect one another, not trying to involve other children who would be below the age of consent. And being gay isn't being degenerate, how many times do I have to explain this to you?

And yes, Menderes, Özal and Çiller were not Islamists. Menderes and Çiller are closer in that they were both centre-right PMs. The difference was Menderes trying to replace Kemalist elites so his politics were about a replacement of elitism in politics. Çiller was different in that she worked with everyone, literally everyone who had an ounce of power to gain power herself. But she wasn’t as savvy as a politician like Erdoğan so she didn’t get to fuck up the country like Erdoğan, her time was small and much weaker. Özal was completely different from both of those as well as Erdoğan. He too was centre right/centrist however Özal’s whole mojo was being the technocrat politician that brought the neoliberal project to Turkish politics and economy after the CIA aided 1980 coup laid the groundwork for that to happen. 

a) If you mean Gülenists, I think we just saw how weak their infiltration of military was in 2016 with such a weak coup attempt and that was years after they purged Kemalist and/or nationalist factions of the military with Ergenekon and Balyoz operations so they were definitely a lot weaker even back then.

*googles*

Ah, here we are.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_the_Air

&gt; School of the Air is a generic term for correspondence schools catering for the primary and early secondary education of children in remote and outback Australia where some or all classes were traditionally conducted by radio, although this is now being replaced by internet technology. In these areas, the school-age population is too small for a conventional school to be viable.

-

&gt; School classes were conducted via shortwave radio from 2003 until 2009,[9] after which most schools switched to wireless internet technologies to deliver lessons that include live one-way video feeds and clear two-way audio.[10][11][12][13][14]
&gt;
&gt;Each student has direct contact with a teacher in an inland town such as Broken Hill, Alice Springs or Meekatharra. Each student typically spends one hour per day receiving group or individual lessons from the teacher, and the rest of the day working through the assigned materials with a parent, older sibling or a hired home-stay tutor. 
&gt;
&gt;Traditionally, the students received their course materials and returned their written work and projects to their hub centre using either the Royal Flying Doctor Service or post office services. However the extension of Internet services into the outback now enables more rapid review of each child's homework.
&gt;
&gt;As the children are in isolated situations, the School of the Air is frequently their first chance of socialisation with children outside their immediate family. This is supplemented by 3 or 4 annual gatherings where the children travel to the school to spend one week with their teacher and classmates.

considering that at the time, courts were actually relatively independent and they could open up such legal cases (which is indeed what happened), yes. it was easy for lawmen to open up such cases, so they did. and thanks to islamist influence within the court, nothing happened to erdoğan.

&gt; Your entire comment is basically “secularist forces didn’t forcefully remove Erdoğan, so Turkey was run by Islamists” which is just grotesquely illogical. 

you are the one calling them ""radical"". if the radical forces were running the country, yes they would be removed. thats what being a radical is. 

this is pointless arguing with you. you clearly have no understanding of how turkish politics have evolved into the authocracy it is today. erdoğan is not a ""reactionary"" result of it, its the final stage. because for it to be ""reactionary"", those ""radicals"" you mentioned needed to control the government to the point of choking everybody else, which they absolutely did not. not even a bit. hell, all those coups that you mention as against the right wing wouldnt be possible without foreign intervention of the us.

2970,"**Crisis in Northern Italy ""Corona came over us like a tsunami“**

**In Lombardy alone, 76 people have died of coronavirus in the past 24 hours. The intensive care units are overcrowded, doctors and nurses work on a piecework basis.**


They are pictures like from an apocalyptic film, created in the regional hospital in Cremona in northern Italy: doctors in full-body protective suits with glasses and face masks can be seen taking care of patients lying half-naked and artificially ventilated on their beds. The doctors and nurses in the intensive care unit of the clinic are, as the coordinator Carla Maestrini tells La7, ""with the forces at the end, terribly tired, we have so many patients"".

Massimo Galli, chief physician for infectious diseases at Milan's Luigi Sacco Hospital, says that in his case the regular infectious diseases department and two sectors in surgery have been vacated just to accommodate the most acute cases of coronavirus disease. The staff work twelve to fourteen hours a day, he says, and there is a shortage of virologists, internists and lung specialists who are urgently needed in such a disaster situation. ""Anyone who thinks the coronavirus thing is overkill, please come to our department.""

Cremona is only 28 kilometres away from Codogno in Lombardy. It was there that the first disease was diagnosed and it is still the epicentre of the rapidly spreading viral disease. The latest figures from Tuesday signal a red alert for Lombardy: 1280 new infections and 76 more deaths within 24 hours. There are already 440 patients in intensive care in various hospitals in the region. ""Another two or three weeks of such a crazy increase in the number of people in the emergency rooms, and in the intensive care units, we would not be able to hold out any longer,"" warns Giulio Gallera, Lombardy's health commissioner.

Within two weeks, 223 additional places in intensive care units had been created, 150 more are planned. But the demand is growing inexorably - one third of all patients are now under 65 years of age. The option of accommodating additional beds in containers or in pavilions at the Milan exhibition centre is being seriously considered, says Gallera. He describes the psychological and physical strain on hospital staff in the words of a doctor who is on the front line: ""I will never forget the eyes of the patient I connected to the ventilator this morning.

**“Every doctor, every nurse is on the edge here""
Raffaele Bruno, chief physician at the San Matteo Hospital in Pavia**

""Corona came over us like a tsunami,"" complains Raffaele Bruno, chief physician for infectious diseases at the San Matteo Hospital in Pavia. This city is also in Lombardy, and it too is only about 30 kilometers from Cordogno. Here, the so-called ""patient number 1"" was treated in the intensive care unit, a 38-year-old manager. Bruno says that he and his staff have often worked 18 hours a day for the past few weeks. ""Every doctor, every nurse is on duty here."" At the moment there are still enough beds in intensive care, ""but nobody knows if the peak of the epidemic is ahead or behind us"".

In the social media, a photo uploaded by doctor Francesca Mangiatordi went viral. Mangiatordi works in the emergency room of the Maggiore hospital in Cremona; there she photographed the nurse Elena Pagliarini, who had fallen asleep on her desk, completely exhausted, wearing disposable gloves, hairnet and protective clothing. In an interview with the Italian online portal ""Nurse Times"", Mangiatordi said that savings had been made in the Italian health care system for years. Beds had been reduced and nurses paid poorly.

""And now we are facing this huge challenge. We don't know how to fill the shifts."" The staff runs from patient to patient, Mangiatordi says, ""We can't do justice to everyone."" Nurse Pagliarini said in an interview with ""La Repubblica"" about the photo of her: ""My shift wasn't over yet, but I was so exhausted.""

**""The situation is dramatic“**

""The situation is dramatic,"" says Guido Marinoni from the medical association in Bergamo, Lombardy. ""We still manage to admit the patients suffering most from respiratory problems, but even those with bilateral pneumonia have to be sent home. They have to be treated by their family doctor.

60 percent of seriously ill Italians live in Lombardy. Can other regions offer help? Only 15 patients have been transferred or flown out - to Tuscany, Lazio, Friuli. As long as the fear that the virus could also spread there suddenly and across the whole country is dispelled, there is little willingness to give up beds in the departments for infectious diseases. How should one react when one needs the beds oneself?

The little good news from Italy is almost drowned in the flood of alarming reports from Italian hospitals. But they do exist: The ""patient number 1"" has meanwhile been able to leave the intensive care unit at the San Matteo hospital in Pavia, he is breathing independently again. And the appeal for donations, which rapper Fedez and his wife launched in favour of Milan's San Raffaele Clinic, has already been answered after just one day by 165,000 Italians. The proceeds: 3.1 million euros.

Not only is there nowhere in the article with a claim of 40 billion just in 2019, it's ACTUAL number is 35 billion TOTAL, based on those ludicrous and often debunked numbers of sheepfucker Erdogan.

&gt;Erdogan has said in speeches that since the beginning of the civil war in Syria, Turkey has spent 40 billion euros on supporting and absorbing Syrian refugees. An investigation conducted by Turkish economist Mustafa Sonmez that was published on the Al-Monitor website in November 2019 shows that these numbers are highly exaggerated, and at the very least they have no convincing explanation behind them.

&gt;For example, Sonmez quotes a report issued by the Turkish President’s Office in 2017, which says Turkey spent about $7.2 billon on the refugees. According to Sonmez‘s calculations, he estimates that the country spent about $24 billion on aiding the refugees between 2013 and 2019, about $16 billion less than the amount Erdogan claimed. The expose also raises doubts about how the aid was used. According to official data only about 145,000 refugees out of roughly 3.7 million live in organized camps with proper accounting and management of the aid funds.

But where are you drawing the line?  So far, to my knowledge, this is an *unprecedented* worldwide response, involving the shutdown of entire countries... to stem the flow of something where thousands of cases are discovered every single day (and it takes 5 days for symptoms to appear).

Two weeks... three weeks... three months?  At which point do we call off the shutdown and return to normal life?  Do we do this for every strain, mutation, new virus?

Hospitals don't run on thin air... and if people are stuck at home for a month, even, the tax-hit on that extending into a second month can bring a country (e.g. Italy - already in the process of recovery from near-bankruptcy) to its knees.

3115,"&gt; If euroepan countries wanted to develop a new stealth fighter then they should have begun development 20 years ago like the f-35

Well, they have (that is Italy, Netherlands and Denmark). It is called the F-35. But the political zeitgeist was very different 30 years ago and relying on the US has turned out to be a terrible decision for political independence.

Regardless of our opinions of modern Turkish geopolitics, they did the same thing as the other European partners BUT they were smart enough to secure that some minor parts where exclusively produced by their companies. They were still cut out when they went awry with modern US foreign policy. Again, even if we consider them unjust and stupid in their scheming, that isn't what matters to the US, it is just ""ours vs theirs"" interests and they didn't coincide. They would do the same thing if the EU decided to fully trade with Iran rather than the ""system"" we currently have.

&gt; Well i don’t think Finland wants to wait until the mid 2040’s to purchase a new European plan that might not exist. If euroepan countries wanted to develop a new stealth fighter then they should have begun development 20 years ago like the f-35

But they might due to the political implications. The US military-industrial complex has been attempting to sabotage EU projects like the A400M, cancel any domestic contracts that are initially awarded to EU defense companies (KC-X) and manipulating test data of their own systems before selling them to customers (THAAD being an absolute dud that couldn't pass simple verification from any kind of foreign non-insider testing; Patriot system needing 20 years before becoming operational as initially designed - who would have guessed SAM system need to stay online for longer than 48h).",Europe,/r/europe/comments/ffgd2l/norways_new_f35_scrambled_for_first_time_to_meet/fk59bmf/,ivarokosbitch,1583875987

You have smaller and largers players. Ever shifting coalitions and power plays. Some day the mediterranian countries combining for certain rules, sometimes the northern europeans, the visegard group, it always changes. 

Germany is a founding member of the EU and the largest country in size and economy, it also provides the largest sums of money while also being interconnected with pretty much every other european country and beyond. Naturally this carries another weight as Estonia or Lichtenstein. But even Germany can't go alone or make descisions on it's own without a majority of other european countries behind it. 

So, not all states are equal. But at the same time, no state is powerless. That is what the EU is really about. To give smaller states a much greater chance to punch above their weight.

And yes, they're comparable. And much so. Why did Sweden, a country of supposed discipline and organisation, have about 370 symptoms, while we have 89?

The Socialdemokraterna are telling immigrants in the ghettos, the most vulnerable areas in Sweden regarding the virus, where most cases are found, that they shouldn't be afraid of going outside in the ""fear of being stigmatised and racism"".

At no point you are being asked whether you like having sex with men, women, sheep, or whatever. Form templates are available online if you'd like to confirm it yourself.

these can be usually acquired by sending a money transfer to the seller. Also, farming is almost guaranteed to keep you poor, at least in Poland, so if your goal is to stop being poor, you might want to avoid it.

&gt; Gay people are also not all leftist

never said they are. And yet it's leftist who aggressively try to shove gay propaganda down people's throats.

and why exactly should they? If it was me dying on the sidewalk, you’d walk right over me.

&gt; It is possible to convince Polish people through talk and have a reasonable chance at winning a future election.

talk, yes. Not gay parades, attempting to force schools to teach prepubescent kids about masturbation, and public shows of degeneracy.

&gt; it's because you have elections where the results are respected and they occur in a much more free environment and dissent is a fundamental right

oookay, that's a good one, not gonna lie. Why don't you sit down for a little lesson of history, huh?

In 1980 in Gdansk, a peon name Wałęsa, has been delivered by a MO(basically the police) motorboat to the back door of Stocznia Gdańska, with a mission to serve as a leader of a thought-to-be revolutionary workers' movement. He was the perfect man for the job. Looks-wise he was the most stereotypical Pole: overweight, with a 'stache, a wife, a 2-bedroom flat in one of Gdansk's prefabricated neighbourhoods. Brains-wise, he was a total hillbilly, and apparently one very close to illiteracy, bassically a total idiot. Except he wasn't exactly the messiah he was claimed by ""everyone"" to be, because a few years earlier, on December 21st, 1970, he signed up as an SB agent and collaborator, codename ""Bolek"", to spy on his friends under the guise of building a new political movement, the ""Solidarity"". The PZPR, Poland's communist party, used their propaganda machine to make him into some sort of godlike figure, a ""people's man"" who the nation was made to believe would save them from communism. This all happened, of course, because the treasuries in Moscow could no longer sustain the socialist economy. Thus the Solidarity rose to power, and after a few major events, the Chernobyl Disaster being one of them, the USSR was on the brink of collapse. Communists needed to think on how to not meet the operational end of a firing squad under treason charges as soon as Moscow's control over Poland disappears. 

So, what did they do? In 1989, when there was no way to save anything anymore, they've gathered some more important people in Magdalenka conference venue on the outskirts of Warsaw. Among the ones invited were:

 - Tadeusz Mazowiecki - prime minister, SB codename unknown due to sabotage - his SB documents were ""miraculously"" removed from the archives by Wałesa and destroyed
 - general Czeslaw Kiszczak - Minister of Internal Affairs, codename ""Fritz""
 - Aleksander Kwasniewski - president of Poland 1995-2005, codename ""Alek""
 - Wladyslaw Frasyniuk - future leader of Solidarity, then rebranded into Unia Wolności, which then again split up and rebranded as Platforma Obywatelska, codename: ""Grzyb""
 - Lech(codename: ""Ryszard"") and Jaroslaw(codename: ""Balbina"") Kaczynscy - future leaders of Porozumienie Centrum, which was later rebranded as Prawo i Sprawiedliwość

And what did they discuss? Officially, the talks were supposed to decide how will the control over country passed from the PZPR. In reality, what they've agreed on is political power in Poland were to be periodically exchanged between two parties, that would be periodically rebranded in order to keep the society doubting on who's who. As such, the talks were considered a success, Wałęsa became the first president since pre-war. Then the faux elections were held, with Mazowiecki becoming the first prime minister of new Republic of Poland. In his exposee, he declared that ""all past atrocities are to be cut off by a thick red line"". Basically, the government of former communists and traitors was created as ""first free government"". For comparison, the traitors in germany were executed.

And then came 1992. During the infamous ""night shift"" talks, in light of newly accepted bill that effectively demanded revealed communist traitors be stripped of power and charged with high treason, MP Janusz Korwin-Mikke(codename: none. Signed the political nonaggression deal with the PZPR, but did not work as an SB agent - the deal was of course void since the PZPR's dissolution in 1989) requested in Sejm for a list of former SB agents to be publicly revealed. The voting failed, of course, as it was voted on by the very traitors to be outed. Kaczynski, Wałesa, Donald Tusk(future leader of Platforma Obywatelska, codename: Oscar), they were all there.

And for the next 28 years so far, they indeed have been trading offices, rebranding their parties in the meantime. The ones who broke the chain were Platforma Obywatelska under Tusk's leadership, except after their second term, a move from, again, Janusz Korwin-Mikke, who used the new laws passed in 2015 that required public observers to be present during elections to create Ruch Kontroli Wyborów(Movement for Verification of Elections), was made, and it resulted in election victory for Prawo i Sprawiedliwosc. Unfortunately or Mikke, the propaganda from state-controlled media didn't leave him a chance to become politically relevant again, but in 2019 elections his party managed to get their highest result since 1989, allowing him to place 13 MPs in Sejm despite the hostile propaganda.

&gt;This also doesn't disqualify that patriarchal systems like ours are enforced by the inequality created through capitalism.

The inequality created by capitalism is wealth inequality. Capitalism wants to extract as much productivity as possible from people. The most capable people filling the most important positions is exactly what capitalism wants. This applies to all positions in society except for inherited positions at the very top, like in old money dynasties.  Of course the markets are very far from efficient, so in reality a lot of incompetent people are in positions they shouldn't hold, even though the people above them (as well as the people below them) don't want that.

&gt;And I do still believe social roles assigned to the genders in a patriarchal system like our own have an effect on this data.  [...] social norms have a big influence on people

Absolutely. And like I said, there definitely is sexism.  But: outcome disparities in and of themselves are not evidence of sexism. They are caused by many factors in combination.

how so? Like I said, homosexuals, if left by themselves, do not possess even a theoretical ability to reproduce. Or maybe we should grant the same benefits to incels? They are just as incapable of reproducing as homosexuals, after all.

&gt; There is nothing obscene of a gay person kissing in public just as there is nothing obscene of a hetero person doing so.

this is not for you to decide. In most societies, the majority decides what's good and what's bad.

&gt; Employing a 10 year old stripper in any context would be very illegal, and I have never heard of anyone doing so for a gay club. If you know of any I am not the guy to talk to but a detective.

never heard of ""Desmond the Amazing""?

&gt; Given that the poster would be a direct insult they could choose not to post the poster.

and exactly like that, Poland decides not to cater to homosexuals and neomarxists trying to force their beliefs upon polish people.

&gt; This is something you can blame on years of a conservative government unwilling to start the necessary reforms of an army that was much reduced in size after the cold war but kept all the unnecessary bureaucracy. The funding right now should be more than enough but so much is wasted on mismanagement.

But why is the government unwilling to start reforms and is apathetic to mismanagement and waste? Could it be that the politicians in charge just do not see much political value in aggressively pursuing such changes over other domestic concerns?  Because the public themselves do not feel it's important and thus do not put much political pressure to change?

Of course the language is always couched in ""anti-zionism"" to provide some cover, but the tropes are largely the same.  To me, it seems that a lot of Germans are not really fooling anyone by saying that they have no problems with Jews when they are so blindingly supportive of Palestine, a territory that has values almost diametrically opposed to normal European values.

Female nurses and teachers aren't paid any better or higher status because Ginni Rometty is CEO of IBM.

What I said was just about discussing ""men still have a higher chance of success in their chose profession"". The slight tilt I talked about is certainly not the most urgent inequality problem we have. Honestly, I won't lose my sleep over a well paid lawyer not ending up as an extremely well paid partner because of his gender, man or woman.

That said, if you look at those who drop out, it becomes an urgent inequality problem. Not necessarily the most urgent, but still an urgent one. The boy who might have learned a useful trade or earn a degree in a better suited educational system might end up as a NEET, or be tempted into crime.

3422,"&gt; Belgium currently can't form a government, so the idea is to split it up. Since Flanders is in favour and can probably function independently, 

The idea isn't splitting up, only our alt-right party is calling for this. The dominant party, NVA, is calling for a form of confederalism.

 [Polls say only 14% of the Belgians want independence,](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/11/04/er-is-geen-draagvlak-voor-de-splitsing-van-belgie/) and 26% want a unitary Belgium.

Currently, there are no plans to organize any form of referendum on Flemish independence because they know they'll lose that election harshly. For no democrat, Flemish independence is on the table. 

 [The alt-right party made great succes because of a well-funded internet campaign.](https://www.redactie24.be/news/26188/ondanks-verkiezingsuitslag-zelfs-n-va--en-vlaams-belang-kiezers-lopen-daar-niet-warm-voor) Both the Flemish separatists and the Flemish autonomists made any strong point on independence during the elections, they both focused on how anti-establishment they were. 22% of the voters of the so-called 'separatist' party actually want a unitary Flanders but most of them vote on the alt-right because of anti-establishment feelings.

In no party nor part of the country there are strong feelings of separatism, even parties who champion on that very same topic don't have a majority among their own voters to push through that decision.

The gay being evil would be a direct insult, which interestingly is also illegal in the penal code of Germany. And the Polish constitution requires human dignity, so that kind of poster would itself be unconstitutional although not really enforceable on it's own. 

In Poland, this kind of discrimination runs very deep, and in the places that have actually declared themselves LGTB+ free zones, even more so. Trying to find other places would be much harder. And why is it ethical to impose a burden on someone like this? And I was referencing current anti discrimination laws in business, not whether to have them in the first place for any reason.

Polls about shitting? Or maybe polls who we afraid most? These are likely to show Germany very high last few years because Germany seriously considered being entitled to enforce some migrants on us.

&gt; It's especially is true when including Poland and Hungary with their authocratic governments, propagandistic state media

Both Poland and Hungary are pretty much standard democracies. Maybe not ultimate ones, but most democracies have some flaws. There will be always controversies which parties should be allowed to run, how much gerrymandering is acceptable, whether electoral threshold is democratic, how much influence should the ruling party have over state media, how much is it acceptable to restrict foreign influence and so on.

But in the end the parties ruling in Hungary and Poland are ruling simply because they are popular. There is no real oppressing of oposition parties in neither of them (or even murders), there are no real restrictions on freedom of speech when it comes to political problems, there are opposition media freely criticising the government. The only problem is opposition is fractured, unable to win confidence of the public, and eager to die on the hill of questioning various conservative values not longer so much popular in the west but still popular there.

But even with that, the opposition will eventually win, because both lands have free elections and the current governing parties are making errors here and there, are somewhat corrupted by power and have some weaknesses in human resources department.

I agree that the British government also has a hand in this but to say that pro-EU and pro-mass immigration leftists don’t overlap is insane. This is why the EU and the principles it supports is thus associated with this faction of people.

Besides, do understand Britain was the second biggest contributor to the EU, and them leaving was a massive blow. This sub likes to hate on Hungary, Poland, the UK, or other countries with more nationalist governments but keep in mind they are the result of a lack of European nationalism. The EU is often seen as a globalist, not European nationalist, union, among the nationalist right. Its most likely due to the EU’s refugee and immigration policies and leanings which caused this. Its getting better, Turkey and Greece right now has showcased the EU’s ability to help unite Europe against foreign threats. However, its too little too late they already lost one of the three big powers of Europe(4 if you count Italy). 

Its going to be a tough road to winning them back and the current system of EU government, unelected leaders being the key point, will have to face massive reforms.

Also, I would argue that someone using your identity as a slur, is absolutely an LGBT issue. It might have started with feminism, sure! But feminism and LGBT have a very big overall in terms of what they wish to achieve and their values.   


Coming back to the identity slur thing. LGBT is about acceptance and tolerance of sexual/gender attractions and sexual/gender identities. If someone claims to be within the LGBT, and uses cis-gendered as an insult, it goes directly against the core values of the LGBT. This should be a big deal, yet never have I seen someone within LGBT ever denounce this kind of behavior.  


To turn the tables around, there are plenty of slurs against gays, lesbians and transgenders. I refuse to use those because of how disrespectful they are. But I think you yourself know that if I were to use these slurs, that people would be crying bloody murder.   


So please don't mistake me trying to be respectful in raising my arguments as me not believing in them. I am doing so to try and show people that I am not here with the intent to hurt them. I would even ask you, do you feel I've been trying to be respectful? I understand you might disagree with what I say and that is absolutely fine, but do you feel like I've tried to raise my concerns in a polite manner?

&gt; People also don't respect most men as leaders. A wannabe male leader is actually expected to find a way to get people to respect him. 

True again, men who display a lot of ""female characteristics"" are not respected either. Logic, strong, decisive men are leaders, Men with culturally accepted manly characteristics are the only true leaders

&gt; Meanwhile quite a few female leaders expect to be respected on the basis of their credentials alone, and if she doesn't get the respect handed to her it's unfair, sexist, etc blabla.

3752,"You're assuming that doing nothing about SARS-CoV-2 would cause the death of _""3% of the old and weak""_. That in itself is a very strong assumption. 

Nobody knows how much of the population would contract the virus if allowed to spread freely—it could be 10%, it could be 90%. Nobody knows for certain the overall case fatality rate (CFR), which is likely around 2-3% but has been estimated anywhere between 0.5% and 5%. Neither does nobody know for certain how much the CFR would increase in case hospitals and ICUs were overwhelmed, but there reports tend to agree that the percentage of patients needing hospital care are around 10% of the confirmed cases.

Given all these unknowns, even if your moral values allowed you to sacrifice 3% of the old and weak, doing nothing would still be an irrational bet.

But let's pretend your estimate is perfectly correct. For the sake of argument, let's assume that doing nothing would result in the death of 3% of the old and weak. Also, let's assume that the death of that 3% is not bad in itself (which I disagree with, but this is just a thought experiment).

So, what's the problem? The problem is first of all that we do not have enough hospital beds for even 3% of the old and weak in our society, let alone all those who would not die but would need to receive treatment in hospital. In the meantime, our medical professionals are (even more!) overwhelmed with their level of work, more likely to become infected and contagious, and more likely to become unavailable to work. 

The hospitals are now saturated. These are the results:

A 12 year-old kid who started having an extremely bad headache and could not bend his neck forward has been rushed by his parents to the ER room. Instead of being immediately being suspected of having bacterial meningitis, given emergency antibiotics, and a lumbar puncture to confirm, they have to wait for 3 hours before even seeing a doctor. The kid is now dead—instead of being alive and fine like my friend Oscar was when this happened to him in the 90s. 

A 25 year-old woman has swollen ganglia in her neck some days after spending a day in the countryside. She tries to see a doctor in ER, but it is overwhelmed, so she needs to get a GP appointment. Next appointment available is in 1 month. So, instead of getting antibiotics within days of first showing symptoms, she now develops full-blown tick-borne lymphadenopathy—instead of curing it early like my partner did in 2010s.

A 33 year-old man was recently hit by a car and left instantly unconscious. The ambulance that would have normally been available to rush him to hospital within &lt;15 minutes is busy moving patients between full hospitals. He is taken to hospital after 30 minutes. The CT scan machine with which they would have detected his epidural haematoma within an hour of the accident is busy scanning people's lungs. He is scanned 2 hours after the accident. He needs an emergency craniotomy to save his life, and he needs it fast. Instead of being operated on &lt;1.5 hours after the accident, he is now operated on &gt;5 hours after the accident, by stressed out and exhausted surgical staff. When he comes out of anaesthesia, he is now severely brain damaged. He will only be able to talk 
again after around 6 months, his personality is completely changed, and he will never be capable of living independently again, and can only just about walk—instead of being almost incredibly recovered now, like when this happened to me in October.

3759,"ROME - ""All of Italy will be a protected area"". All displacements are prohibited except for proven needs, throughout the country as had happened up to now in Lombardy and in the 14 provinces outbreak of the Coronavirus epidemic. This was announced by Prime Minister Conte at a press conference at Palazzo Chigi, confirming what was announced by the Minister for Relations with the Regions, Francesco Boccia, speaking of ""progressive homogenization of the rules throughout the national territory"".

The premier comes to the press room alone, for what is undoubtedly the most dramatic announcement of his government experience: ""We have adopted a new decision based on an assumption: there is no time"", he says. ""The numbers tell us that we are having an important growth of the infections, of the people hospitalized in intensive and sub-intensive care and alas also of the deceased people. Our habits therefore must be changed. They must be changed now. I decided to take even more stringent measures immediately, stronger. "" The measure is the one expected and now considered inevitable: ""I am about to sign a measure that we can summarize as 'stay at home'. There will no longer be a red area on the peninsula. Italy will be a protected area"", he adds.

**""Movements prohibited except for proven needs""**

As already today in Lombardy and in the 14 northern provinces, the movement of people is prohibited if not for proven reasons of health, necessity or work. ""I am fully aware of the seriousness and responsibility,"" explains Conte. ""We can't afford to let our guard down. It's time for responsibility and we all have it. You citizens all with me. The right decision today is to stay at home. Our future is in our hands,"" he adds.

""There is no limitation on public transport on the agenda, to ensure the continuity of the production system and allow people to go to work,"" says the premier. It will be possible to ""self-certify"" to justify the movements, ""but if there was an untruthful self-certification there would be a crime"", he specifies.

The new measures, which will be in the Official Gazette tonight and will become operational from tomorrow morning, and of which the premier informed the Quirinale and the oppositions, also concern schools and sporting events: throughout Italy the institutes will remain closed until April 3. The sporting events will not continue, so the Serie A championship will also stop. ""Let's also add the ban on gatherings outdoors and in places open to the public,"" said the Prime Minister. Throughout Italy, bars and restaurants will close at 6pm.

**Italy, today 1598 new infected**

The head of civil protection , Angelo Borrelli , starts from the healed , in his daily point on the coronavirus emergency in Italy: there are 724, 102 more than yesterday. Then the count of the dead: there are 463, 97 more than yesterday. With the division by age group: 1% from 50 to 59 years; 10% from 60 to 69; 31% from 70 to 79; 44% from 80 to 89; 14% over ninety. Finally, the sick, which are 7,985, an increase of 1,598 people compared to yesterday. The commissioner then said that around one million protective masks had been delivered across the country, one hundred thousand of which were supplied to prison facilities. ""From tomorrow we will distribute 100 thousand masks in penitentiary institutions, where 80 pre-triage tents have been installed"" for coronavirus screening.

**Boccia: ""All ski lifts closed""**

Shortly before the Minister for Regional Affairs and Autonomies Francesco Boccia, present at the press conference, announced: ""The government is working on a progressive homogenization of the rules throughout the country"". Boccia has specified that in addition to the rules, we are also working with the regions for homogeneous ""prescriptions and discipline"" throughout the national territory, an operation that will also be done through political confrontation. The minister also announced the closure of the ski resorts from Tuesday. The minister stressed that there is full agreement, on this decision, by all the presidents of the Regions and autonomous provinces, as well as Anci and Upi, who have formed a permanent table that meets every day - through video links - at the headquarters of the Civil Protection Department.

**Lombardy center of contagion, Rome observed special**

As for ICU patients, Borrelli specified, there are 733, 83 more than yesterday. Of these 440 are in Lombardy, which had an increase in 41 cases in one day. There are instead 4,316 patients with hospitalized symptoms and 2,936 those in home isolation. ""Today the connection with the regions continued for the necessary equipment, and we have started delivering 325 respiratory ventilators for intensive and subintensive therapy, the distribution starts with Lombardy"", added Borrelli. ""The average age of ICU patients, hospitalized in critical conditions, is very high in Italy"", observed the head of the infectious diseases department of the ISS, Gianni Rezza. There are 463 Italian victims of the coronavirus. ""If we stratify the lethality rates by age"" in Italy ""we see that they are lower than those of China. It is possible then that, since symptomatic people are being buffered - adds the expert - the denominator is reduced to people with symptoms or hospitalized, and therefore the lethality rate of the disease seems higher than it is "".

Asked about the situation in Rome, Rezza, who said that in the capital the ""virus is starting to circulate"", replied: ""On Rome mine was a pre-emptive alarm. We found ourselves with a completely unexpected situation in Codogno, dramatic, but then it was not known that the virus was circulating. If we now see even a small increase in a location far from the red zone, it is right to pay attention immediately so as not to find ourselves in difficulty afterwards.

3960,"&gt; Your point about males not being held back by societal pressure if they were to unionize and demand equal treatment.

Good thing I didn't make that point. I clearly implied that men contribute to those societal pressures just as much, if not more, since they're half of the society. Just like for example tons of women were contributing to the idea that they shouldn't have the right to vote in the past and were actively campaining against it.

&gt; People are demonizing men's rights activists that are fighting for divorce laws reform and, more importantly, for a change in the societal perception of male victims of rape. They got laughed at when they asked for shelters to harbor male victims because male victims aren't welcome in the shelters already in place, as those are meant for female victims.

MRAs are usually demonized for their misogyny, normal progressive men groups are usually cheered on, since they have literally the same goals as feminist groups, which they're often part of.

There's less male shelters, because there's less male victims coming forward seeking help, mostly due to toxic masculinity.

&gt; Prison rape is used as a punch line at the expense of men. Try joking about female rape, you'll get cancelled, doxxed and you'll get your life ruined in 2 seconds flat. If you joke about a man getting raped you probably work in show business.

Which gender do you think is more likely to joke about male rape? Be the writer/director of a show/movie that makes it into a joke? Which gender is usually the politician pushing for ""tough on crime"" policies that feed into the social mindset of treating prisoners like trash, including joking about their rape, instead of rehabilitating them? I'd argue it can be fairly easily traced to toxic masculinity of the men behind most of these things.",,/r/europe/comments/ffri0b/females_ages_3034_and_males_ages_3034_with_higher/fk36s1d/,TheDromes,1583819791

3997,"&gt;There's nothing wrong with loving one's self to a certain extent. However, when self-love goes beyond certain limits, i.e. into the realms of arrogance and exploiting of the well-being of other human beings, this is most contemptible.

There is no limit. It's impossible to pursue your own interests to any degree without hurting someone else's interests in turn. Just by living you consume resources, resources which could have been instead consumed by others. Competition is an inherent part of life, even plants starve each others of sunlight.

&gt;There is enough for everyone, especially back then. But, as you should know, there were people like you who wanted more at the expense of others. It's called greed.

There self-evidently isn't enough for everyone, since the number of people and the amount of stuff are independent from each other. This is true even if ""enough"" is just bare survival, and most people don't think that's enough, which is healthy aspiration. 

&gt;You also know what else has been going on since the dawn of life? Disparate peoples coming together.

4057,"You seem to be pretty uninformed about the United States of America, so I’ll try to help.

The USA is a constitutional republic consisting of a federation of 50 independent states and 16 territories.

It would be more similar to the EU than anything; where each state has its own laws that they enforce independently, with a different tax system in each, where they send political representatives to represent their interests in Washington DC, just like how Europe sends theirs to Brussels.

The US has nearly half the population of Europe, and we are catching up rapidly. The US is nearly the same size as Europe; 9,833,000 square kilometers and 10,180,000 square kilometers, respectively.

Europe wanted to be known as a consolidated political and economic entity. Some even want a combined EU military...

So you want the political, economic, and military influence of a combined bloc, but you don’t want to share the same criticisms with your neighbors. This is irrational...

Not only this, but then you speak out against generalizing, but yet you generalize the entire USA.

&gt; Blaming entire continents consisting of different countries for something is pretty absurd, it's like blaming all Europeans of the Nazi party or something. The question wasn't about slavery in North america, it was about slavery in the U. S. of A.

Did you know that some states did not have slaves, that some slaves were rescued from slavery with the “underground railroad”, and that a civil war between US states resulted primarily over the question of slavery?

4083,"It's not even a secret by now, doctors and hospital directors in Italy are publicly saying that the situation is very hard to manage, they lack beds and personnel etc to treat everybody, and we're still at the start of the epidemic, if it keeps spreading exponentially it will be a mess

I mean, we have 5000 ICU beds in the whole country, and Covid19 patients are already occupying 700 of those, and as I said we're just at the beginning, and also keep in mind that ICUs are used for other reasons as well, they're not empty waiting for an epidemic, so for every ICU used by a Covid patient it won't be available to people who may not have anything to do with it. That's not the only side effect, I've heard about chemotherapy treatments for cancer patients being delayed for example. Now they're buying new ventilators and stuff so there should be more ICU beds, but it won't be enough if the virus keeps spreading exponentially

From what I read other first world countries have a number of ICU beds in the order of the thousands/tens of thousands, the USA has like 100k. You can understand that it this virus infects millions of people in a country with a significant portion of them requiring ICU treatment no country will be able to handle it, that's why it's important to ""dilute"" infects over time

That's why when I read people who are still saying that this is just a flu I roll my eyes. Don't get me wrong, for most people there are just some light symptoms, but the flu never caused such an emergency situation in hospitals

Communication on this virus has been a mess everywhere so far, it seems like people either panic hysterically or downplay stuff, it's hard to find balanced positions. On the one hand the media keeps talking about it, so people overreact and say that this virus is just a media hoax or some bullshit, which just helps the spread, then the virus hits your country and while you realize that it's not the black plague you understand why China reacted in such a way, and you hear the same stuff you were hearing in leaked chinese calls in your own country, and you start being worried about your grandparents, potentially even your parents, whether they'll be able to be treated if they ever get the virus, and so on

I hope not but I think that other european countries may be in a similar situation in the next weeks, unless they do something and manage to slow down the spread significantly. In Germany and France there are already over 1000 infects but just a few deaths compared to Italy so my guess is that they're at an earlier stage and deaths will start in 1-2 weeks, what will happen is hard to tell at this point 

Overall no panic, but still saying that this is just a flu is just doing the virus a favour at this point. What most people don't realise is what an exponential spread really means, I still see people talking about how x infects are nothing compared to the total population, not realizing that if you don't slow down the spread the amount of infects can rise pretty fast, until it's too late",,/r/europe/comments/fg1hso/italy_closes_down_all_the_nation_in_quarantine/fk30yha/,Junkererer,1583814283

&gt;While parades are a popular way for the Irish to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day now, the St. Patrick’s Day parade did not originate in Ireland.

&gt;
&gt;It was not until 1995 that Ireland held its own first St. Patrick’s Day parade, which was done to help boost tourism to the island. Gradually, the parade became the St. Patrick’s Festival, which is a five-day event each year featuring not only the parade, but plays, concerts, art shows, carnival rides, street vendors selling food, and more festivities.

4136,"I'm replying late because I must have missed the notification and only now saw this comment.

&gt; The polish law is not ""shall issue"" its per voivodeship police head to decide whether you get it or not. 

Dude, I live here, that's not true. There were some problems in the past, most notably with the Silesian voivodeship police doing everything in their power to deny people permits (and being very creative at that, too), but they lost in courts and now even there people can get guns. Nowadays most nonsense that we have with gun regulations comes from MSWiA (ministry of interior and administration, they're mostly a hassle to firearm dealers) and KGP (HQ of Police for the country) but most of the time things sort themselves out (at least for now). This is how things have been since 2011, before 2011 it was as you're saying. Even former criminals become gun owners, for most convictions a couple years is enough for them to get expunged. We can also buy and own suppressors without any paperwork; OTOH full auto is very difficult/almost impossible for people who don't have interest in running a firearm-related business. 

The only flexibility KWPs still retain is how many guns they allow a given person to register without applying for an extension, usually it's 15-30 guns, very few people get near the limit, but even then it's not a huge issue, as all they want is to schedule an appointment where a cop will be sent to see if the guns are in a safe (they can be loaded), sometimes they won't even bother with that.

&gt; In terms of ability to defend yourself - thats another big no; The polish courts from what i've read does not allow for self-defense, or required defense . They have put many people in jail or fined for defending themselves, and their loved ones. (even though law should allow them to do so.)

While some lower courts cause problems if the case isn't clear cut, higher courts are almost universally sane. It's not as great as I'd like it to be, but with a lot of high profile convictions if you read into the details the person who hurt or killed the other person was partly at blame too, e.g. one guy stabbed 2 people to death when they came to his house and started beating some of his family members, turns out he stole drugs from them and he stabbed them in the back as they were running away (bodies were found 50 meters outside his house) - he got 10 years for that. Another one got a suspended sentence after he shot a thief who was running away in the back (the thief survived but is paralyzed now).

https://www.militaria.pl/porady/samoobrona/zakres-obrony-koniecznej.xml

&gt; The ""sports"" firearm license does not give you ability to carry. For that you need additional permit which again you may or most likely may not get at all - as you need to prove there's immediate danger to your life. The whole idea of ""sports"" license is a big no - in ideological term. It should be called firearm license, not sports.

Again, I don't know where you're getting your knowledge about Polish firearm laws from, but it's out of date. Since 2014 the sports permit/license allows for carrying of loaded firearms:

There's more to this than just a slightly older population. It has to be something cultural that's allowing it to spread so easily.

4291,"&gt;I do not understand how they're claiming that bias is not at play, when they acknowledge that the disparity grows between male and female students, when the share of female teachers are higher. How would they disprove the presence of bias using performance data from ~~this~~ [these 69] swedish school[s]? 

They acknowledge that the disparity between male and female students is larger in those subjects where the share of female teachers is higher. They try and investigate whether bias is at play by comparing this disparity in the case that a particular subject (with a particular share of female teachers teaching it) was taught by a female teacher and the case that it was taught by a male teacher. They find that the disparity is approximately equally large most of the time. They conclude from this that the bias is not so much due to the gender of the teacher but rather the subject matter and propose that women may tend to become teachers in those subjects were girls excel particularly.

&gt;They also ""estimate"" that a same-sex teacher wouldn't have a significant impact. How would you ""estimate"" something like that reliably?

They estimate it by comparing the results of students with same-sex teachers and without as explained above. By ""estimate"" it is not meant that they assume this a priori and start analysing from there. This estimation is their finding.

I do not doubt the OECD study and the other study's findings that girls are given better marks by teachers (unfairly). But this does not necessarily mean that this unfair treatment is due to the prevalence of female teachers. In fact this assumption is not raised in either study as far as I could tell by a quick skim.",,/r/europe/comments/ffri0b/females_ages_3034_and_males_ages_3034_with_higher/fk2c0yy/,Proxima55,1583797663

4294,""" I disagree. Self-love is love.""

There's nothing wrong with loving one's self to a certain extent. However, when self-love goes beyond certain limits, i.e. into the realms of arrogance and exploiting of the well-being of other human beings, this is most contemptible.

"" The European colonists wanted a better life for themselves, and this  simply was not possible without the spoliation of the natives. There was  only so much land and it couldn't sustain both European farmers and  Native hunters. So, war. Some lost, some won. And it was nothing new,  the same had been going on since the dawn of life itself. ""

That you even defend the atrocities of the colonial era is abominable. You really can't be so naive, can you? There is enough for everyone, especially back then. But, as you should know, there were people like you who wanted more at the expense of others. It's called greed.

You also know what else has been going on since the dawn of life? Disparate peoples coming together. People learning to live in harmony, compassion, and love with others who are different from them. People learning to live without exploiting the well-being of other humans. Yeah, guess what? These things have happened. Just because they aren't as common doesn't mean they don't exist and people don't do them even now.

""Nobody is capable of a logically impossible feat.""

Agape love is not ""logically impossible."" In fact, I've known people who've demonstrated it. Indeed, many demonstrate it on a daily basis.

Again, just because you aren't of love, and evidently, don't know any who are, doesn't mean they don't exist. Open your eyes. Soften your heart. There's hope for your orcish lot yet.

The black plague was in the 1300. Medicine wasn’t really a thing back then was it. You keep coming up with these massive breakouts when in reality we’ve had multiple flu breakouts way more similair to the current one. No flu breakout has killed over 3 million people since the Spanish flu. Which you would know if you read the article I send in my previous comment. 

I never said anything about the fatality of age. I don’t care wheter a 20 year old dies or an 80 year old dies but we know that younger people up to 40 are safer to the virus then older people.

You keep bringing up these fucking dumb examples that I never even mention. Now you’re starting about age when I never fucking said anything about age. 

The Spanish flu again was a breakout over 100 years ago, the most deadly virus outbreak in recent times and they didn’t even identify it as a virus untill 1933. 

Ill say it again you’re a fucking idiot, you’re mixing facts with experiences and don’t seem to want to be calmed down but rather be so worked up about it that you will blindly ignore that in the west the fatality rate is lower then the 3.6% given. I literally gave you a website that collects all data on the virus but you link me a fucking video that has nothing to do with what we’re currently talking about.

You are one of the biggest problems with this virus, the panic that causes people to buy all the soap in stores and mouth caps. You’re a real dumbass to only expect the worst and have no faith in the health systems.

In my little town and surroundings everything looks like A Quiet Place. No cars or just a few every now and then (mostly public transportation). Every shop closed. No libraries, no bars, cinemas, museum. Hotels are closing too. And thus we're now left with basic places still open, like supermarkets, bank and post office, where you still cannot go if there are already too many people.

I also live in the mountains so there's not a great internet connection, which prevents me from staying in contact with university teachers. I just have to Skype them with audio only most of the time.

Our local hospital is CROWDED and I'm really sorry for the doctors with their nonstop shifts. When my grandma felt sick we followed the procedure and got contacted by ASL (local health service).

We can say that women that apply to an university tend to pass more than men, but the low percentage of women in STEM universities is simply a case of women not being interested, not about women not being capable.

4359,"&gt;Serfdom ran rampant in every part of Russian Empire. Estonia wasn't a special case. That's how Russian politics worked back then but it's way too distant past to be relevant. And fact stays there, serfdom in Estonia was abolished earlier than in other parts of Russian Empire.

Again this arrogance with generalizing things, while you clearly lack the knowledge about our regional case. 

In Russia there were both Russian nobility and Russian serfs, in Estonia/Latvia there were Baltic German nobility and Estonian/Latvian serfs. And this occurred throughout its existence under a completely separate system from the [later rest of the] Russian Empire. So what is there similar again?

&gt;serfdom in Estonia was abolished earlier than in other parts of Russian Empire. 

Yes, but serfdom was followed by corvee labour which often if not generally is considered to have been worse than the serfdom we had.

&gt;No, I told you how USSR worked so that you can realize everyone suffered and Estonia wasn't a special case.

Why would Estonia need to be a special case to be unlucky?

And yet it was a specil case, considering that it was an illegally occupied state and definitely not all places saw such Russification attempts.

&gt;Stalin wasn't even Russian and he was the one who destroyed most cultural heritage. He was Georgian ethnically, but he didn't spare Georgians either nor consider himself to be one and destroyed many churches and cathedrals in there as well. He was Soviet, not Russian, not Georgian. He was a communist. Do you think the Russian priests were begging Stalin to destroy the churches? Ok even if we say it was ""our own country destroying things"", even then USSR still destroyed things in every republic. Estonia is still not the special case. Caucasus was occupied by Red Army too, they didn't join willingly either. Same for Ukraine and rest of the Soviet republics and even Russia was taken over by force. Forgot entire White Movement? 

The Soviet Union was a Russian empire, its core communist power came from Russia and it used Russification as one of uts main political tools. It doesn't matter that there were other Russians favouring another type of Russian empire...

&gt;Yeah but you did restore your independence and it didn't happen for a decade more. That's what being lucky means.

Yes, such a lucky nation compared to others - somehow managed to avoid being destroyed for good...

&gt;But for similar development level, we can use Georgia instead.

It does happen that.  
But to give such an example, I'd argue that the entire culture of removing gendered words from language because it is considered offensive is kind of weird, considering that in the LGBT sphere the term 'mansplaining' often gets used.

As societies become more equal opportunity wise, the sex differences in certain behaviors becomes magnified and by extension this is also true for what kind of jobs people chose. 

When society is good enough that people can chose what they're passionate about, that's when you see some of the largest disparities. 

IT is a good example. In many developing countries with strong gender roles and discrimination the ratio between women and men in IT is more equal than in Scandinavia for example. 

As the country develops and people no longer have to chose a job based on what pays the best or what their family chooses for them, you see mostly men in IT and women in psychology or teaching.

You tell me what being a LGBT free zone means. Because I sure as hell wouldn't support an e.g. ""Jew free"" zone either. And being that one is a choice. It isn't yet outlawed but come on, how dense do you have to pretend to be to not see what is meant to happen in the future if they manage to get away with it (hint: look at Russia...).

&gt; Are you not paying attention? **I'm not talking about my own country!!** I am talking about foreigners wanting to enact societal changes for in other countries and whether or that is a good thing. 

Bold words, we are talking about if this is a subjective thing or something infringing human rights, which by your own admission in the other comment makes outside intervention necessary. I just tried to make it easier for you to understand WHY it is the second one. So no, I know exactly what we are talking about here.

&gt; A better comparison would be if foreign activists in Saudi Arabia protested for better treatment of Islamic terrorists in Norway, or harsher treatment for drug users or criminalizing homosexuality here. 

Nope, one (being a terrorist or a drug user) is a choice, at least at the beginning. You don't choose to be gay. Also: they are free to do exactly that and in fact they are doing exactly that. surprise: nobody cares what those cultist are saying.

&gt; **Foreigners should not get involved in the affairs of my country.** Get it? Should domestic policies and cultural change not be left up to the people actually belonging to said society?

Mostly yes, but there are limits. We are more and more an interconnected global society. Even today we are already influencing the domestic policies of other countries.

The Kremlin decree  “On the Basics of State Policy of the Russian Federation in the Arctic  for the Period Until 2035”, signed by President Vladimir Putin, set out  its policy plans paving the way for massive industrialization of the  energy-rich region.

In recent time, the Arctic’s Northern Sea Route has seen explosive  growth in traffic as the sea corridor between China and Europe cuts the  travel by 40% compared to sailing via the Suez Canal.

Arctic nations are building new, more powerful icebreakers able to open year-round shipping lanes.

Moscow approved a number of decrees on 30 January which were the  economic foundation for newly introduced Russian Arctic strategy. They  divided the tasks of developing the Northern Sea Route, Russia’s remote  Arctic sea artery, among the country’s state oil and gas monopolies.

By 2035, Russia intends to build at least 40 Arctic vessels, upgrade  four regional airports, construct railways and seaports and facilitate  massive exploitation of Arctic natural resources.",,/r/europe/comments/fg09ki/russia_significantly_steps_up_arctic_engagement/fk1lwdy/,FDGirl22,1583782312

4509,"At least six prisoners have died in Italy during riots measures aimed at restricting the spread of coronavirus. 

Inmates have protested against a ban on normal family meetings as Covid-19 brings parts of northern Italy to a standstill. 

A spokesperson for the Italian Ministry of Justice told The Independent that rioting prisoners in Modena “raided the pharmacy” and consumed drugs, including methadone.


It is thought that two inmates died inside the prison from drugs, while another suffocated to death after protesters started fires, according to the spokesperson. 

They said three more inmates died after being moved from the prison, with autopsy reports to come for all. 

Multiple others were hospitalised after the Modena prison riot, according to Italian newspaper La Repubblica. 

It was initially unclear how these prisoners from the nothern Italian jail died, with Donato Capece from Sappe, a union for penitentiary police, saying all six had died from a methadone overdose. 

Riots erupted after anti-coronavirus measures suspended normal family visits in prisons. 

In some cases, relatives gathered outside prisons to show their anger against the policy, passed by an emergency decree on Sunday.

Until 22 March, prisoners will only be allowed to contact their visitors by phone or other remote methods. 

OSAPP, another union for penitentiary police, said there had been “chaos” in Italian prisons, with at least thirty riots taking place in jails across the country after the restrictions were announced. 

The head of Italy’s prison administration, Francesco Basentini, said three inmates died at the jail in Modena, and three others died after being moved elsewhere. 

He told local radio that there had been a “wave” of protests in prisons across the country. 

Some inmates have managed to escape during a riot in Foggia, according to local media. 

Sappe, the union, said two guards had been taken hostage in the northern city of Pavia and were released after a police raid.

Riots have taken place in Naples, Vercelli in Peidmont and Frosinone in Lazio, according to OSAPP. 

On Monday, inmates climbed onto the roof of the San Vittore prison in Milan and held up a painted sheet reading “Indulto”, Italian for pardon.

The measures are aimed at tackling the spread of Covid-19, which has infected over 5,800 people in Italy to date. 

Over 16m people have been placed in quarantine as the northern region of Lombardy – which includes Milan – was put on lockdown.

Over 360 people infected with Covid-19 – a flu-lke virus that can develop into pneumonia – have died in Italy to date.",,/r/europe/comments/ffyaca/italy_prison_riots_six_die_amid_protests_over/fk19cp7/,bataneyelid,1583775052

So your average girl might prefer a doll more than a boy, but society/peer pressure pushes the average, so those that stand out get ostracised/pushed into the status quo. I think this is biggest in boys, with anything associated with ‘femininity’ being mocked/bullied on. While fitting into a role has been relevant for our ancestors, I’d say today we’re in a world where we can allow for liberty in choice of expression and play. Dolls, for example, probably help prepare girls for motherhood. As a species we are advanced enough to now choose _whether_ to have kids, and there’s no need to push a girl that doesn’t want to play with dolls to do so. She may never need that experience in mothering. On the other side, fathers now play a bigger and bigger role in childcare, and perhaps a little boy who plays with dolls will be a fantastic parent when they grow up.",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/ffri0b/females_ages_3034_and_males_ages_3034_with_higher/fk19job/,ViolaPurpurea,1583775165

4557,"&gt; in my country 

I sometimes forget that living in Finland is sometimes like living in the future. This is an exception in Europe and commonly if there is a difference, it is not significant. And on top of it: this was your proof? Not only is it but a detail on pension law, a very specific thing, it is also using system that exceptionally makes different laws. The question was not really ""do those systems exists at all"" but more about what is ethical and what is more commonly used in the justices around the world, and specifically in Europe. If Russia has weird and archaic laws, that really has no any relevance about the differences in boys and girls in European high education.

&gt;  I don't know about even a single law which gives more to men instead of women. I know really a lot of laws which are better for women.

And.. are you going to anything about knowing this? It is quite literally the other half of the equation, not that any differences should exist but if you are going to argue about differences between two things..

So, to correct, YOUR laws support women but it is not related to the topic, it is just a curiosity.

Note: very, VERY often the correct policies to reach equality is to boost one demographic more. We do give some benefits even here to women. Those have been found to work very well; giving women better opportunity creates a new culture, one where seeing women as the boss is not at all exceptional.. They are not meant to last forever but gradually be removed. There is no such things as perfectly fair and we can not always wait until things settle ""naturally"".

Girls just... Don't apply to engineering fields? I have no idea why. Maybe we have more unnoticed gender norms set in school than we realise? Or the fields aren't just seen as an attractive option?

That said, I just changed careers to learn to become a machinist (from service profession, mid level management), and my experience on the school when I was 16, and now 20 years later are like a night and day. When I wanted to go to tech school back then, neither the school, nor the student counceling wanted me there. ""Not a job for small girls."" 

This time round tho, it's been awesome, nobody gives a shit of my gender (as it should be), and they were just happy to get more motivated students. So far, doesn't seem too hard to get training jobs either.

Look at this picture of Gdansk (Danzig) from Wiki: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gdańsk#/media/File:Calle\_Dlugie\_Pobrzeze,\_Gdansk,\_Polonia,\_2013-05-20,\_DD\_06.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gdańsk#/media/File:Calle_Dlugie_Pobrzeze,_Gdansk,_Polonia,_2013-05-20,_DD_06.jpg)

Compare the gable of the building with the green windows roughly in the middle of the photo of Gdansk with the yellow/orange building just beyond the outstretched hand of the Nazi in the cartoon. That's simply not a design you see much in the UK but is common in parts of Europe. 

I think u/die_liebe is correct, it's either Gdansk or a generic city somewhere in Europe.",,/r/europe/comments/fff109/ww2_british_propaganda_poster/fk0wyc7/,WhiteSatanicMills,1583767972

4631,"I have seen that, one thing I notice is that study obviously uses a different method of classification, as it gives Norway and Finland very similar levels of both gender equality and women in science and engineering, in contrast, the eurostat information gives Norway and Finland very different quantities of women scientists, on opposite sides of the record.

But that isn't too hard to explain; one obvious difference is that numbers of engineers in society in general, and number of women *currently taking* engineering qualifications, are very different quantities to measure, according to most intentional statistics, women still are vastly outnumbered as actual engineers, researchers and scientists in many of these countries.

Though there are exceptions; in algeria, for example, women form under 20% of the labour force, but [47% of research staff](http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/fs55-women-in-science-2019-en.pdf) (see page 4). In that situation, you can see why a woman wanting a job might head towards science. That's science, not stem as a whole, but you get the idea.

If you have a country where only say 30-40% of women are going to get jobs, and your way to get one of those is to take a science qualification, it's pretty easy to see why women would particularly go for it, even if many train up, gain those qualifications only to end up staying home looking after kids and not having full participation in civil and economic life.

Another question you could ask would be why norway and finland, despite having very similar levels of graduates, have such a difference in the number of women employed. Is it due to non-degree paths for entry to engineering in norway? For example in the oil industry? A legacy of higher graduation rates in previous years?

4671,"I know my comment here will probably get downvoted into oblivion, but I honestly do kind of understand why some people dislike the LGBT movement.  
In that way, I don't interpret this as Poles being against lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people, but rather against the political sphere that comes with it. Because yes, that political sphere does push very extreme views, for instance, when it comes down to the language we use.  


I've never had a problem with lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people. I wish them all the best and I do recognize that there was a time when there was heavy discrimination against these people within Europe. I'm also not saying that there isn't any discrimination against these people in Europe anymore. Yes, there will be some Poles that genuinely do dislike people because they divert from straight. Bad people can be found in literally any group. From my experience with Polish people, they generally have no issue with gay, lesbian, transgender or bisexual. Rather they've a problem with the movement, which I can fully understand.  


To put it bluntly, I feel the LGBT movement within the Western world, has strayed from their core values of tolerance and acceptance, and have started to point out inequalities where there either aren't any or the inequality stems not from hate or intolerance but rather from more natural reasons. Considering how media often shows the extremes, I can see how generally the LGBT movement has gather a very negative image in the eyes of many because of this. So organizing a big protest in a different country, with provocative statements like ""Piss on pis"" isn't going to make people change their minds.

I appreciate that you are being precise.

It comes up after France. So Brexit has even managed to knock the UK off a meaningless coolness index made by a UK company.

Soft power is an attractive concept to politicos in aging, weakening post-colonist nations. It has absolutely no intrinsic meaning. I'm not even sure why the softpower30 exists. How does it help anyone besides people like you? Do companies use it to decide where to place their headquarters?

Has the UK convinced other countries to switch to its style of government? No one else is worshiping the queen. I haven't seen many new monarchies taking form. Sure, you took the Falklands back from Argentina without repercussions, but otherwise what exactly has the UK been doing with all this soft power?

""People speak English and 0 degrees longitude runs through England"" --- you might be thinking something like this. Well, those are some cool historical artifacts.

&gt; Biggest selling musician, Adele.

Do you know how people listen to music now? They almost never purchase it. Check this out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-streamed_artists_on_Spotify. It's kind of similar to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa_xDn2yL-o. You've got Ed Sheeran. But it's not like the UK is punching above its weight in this list. It's almost all American (both north and south) artists. That's a natural result of the melting pot of world cultures found in the Americas, which gave rise to virtually all modern popular music. If the UK wants to be important in the *future*, it should aim to foster this kind of open, world society. Its musical contribution in the 20th century had a lot more to do with importing American styles into Europe than some kind of unique contribution to world music.

Obviously these are just opinions, but the list of most popular musicians on spotify and youtube should say something to you.

I heard once, and looking around, kind of believe it's true, that (for suits) the English always want to dress like the Italians, and the Italians always like the English. So the two styles cycle around each other.

""sandwich"" is an English word. But many other cultures put ingredients between slices of bread / into pieces of bread, and have done so for a long, long time. That's how people in much of the world (where there's bread) still eat their food, pre-utensil style.

Just for example, here in the US divorces are disproportionately favorable to women, with men's arguments often being cast to the side, even if valid. If kids are involved it gets even worse, as the likelyhood that the father will get custody of the child is essentially 0. Nobody brings this up, or enjoy ignoring it when it is brought up.

You can't artificially just force women into fields of study either. Yes, there's not many women in STEM, but this isn't indicative of purposeful inequality on the part of the STEM field, it's a cultural bias which can't be fixed by just lowering the bar for entry if you happen to be a minority in the field. If you want to stimulate female enrollment into those fields, then there needs to be a societal push to encourage STEM irrespective of gender, otherwise it's not going to change. This can also be expanded out to education and the workplace as a whole.

4778,"Im Greece higher education,  which follows high school high school,  had two official categories.
 1. AEI,  which translates to Highest Education Institutions, and includes Law,  Medical,  Polytechnic etc,  the quintisensial University.
2. TEI,  translating to Technological Education Institutions, and includes a variety of staff,  like Computer Engineering, Food Technologies, Wine making, Fisheries production and cultivation etc. This is the category I am referring to as technical schools. Some time ago they were renamed to ATEI,  meaning Highest Technological Educational Institutions.

Its a somewhat weird distinction, the second category covering a grand variety of subjects, and sometimes  even similar to the first category. For exanple,  Computer Engineering is also a subject in Polytechnic Schools,  offering a Computer Engineers degree. The difference lies mostly in that the second category is designed to be a bit more focused on practice rather than theory. But they do offer degrees for what they do as well,  which can thwn lead to postgrad,  doctorates etc,  so they can be considered higher education.

yes, in Germany judges are directly appointed by the government, and don't get a lifetime tenure, which means that dissent is effectively impossible.

&gt; Poland has to follow the ECJ's rulings because it agreed to do so in the EU treaties. They don't do that, they have no business in the Union.

EU nations are required to protect the Union's borders against any illegal immigration, they've agreed to do so in the EU treaties. They don't do that, they have no business in the Union. And no, before we get to leftist newspeak, islamic illegals are not ""refugees"" - no islamic country currently in state of war has borders with EU, which means migrants from there are not eligible for a refugee status. Poland, on the other hand, accepted over 2M Ukrainian refugees since the start od Donbas war.

That is old way of thinking though. I give you that some decades ago CEO positions were filled with so called professional managers. However, since like startup era started picking up heavily in the 90s, the early financiers of businesses noticed a trend that it is better to teach a visionary how to lead rather than put them on the sidelines and let professional manager take their place. Professional managers are good and can run a company like well oiled machine, however, they lack a vision and thus will only lead to stagnation on the long term.

4850,"Just my guess, but i will throw it in anyway. 

Women are get mentally mature a lot earlier than men, which make them more likley to think long term and make good life choices at say 18-22 when most people start higher education. Other than that it is impossible to know how much is genetic and how much is cultural.

One explenation might be genetic. Throughout most of history, women have generally had to be genealists and do A LOT of mental work. Those who werent able to master that didn’t get as many surviving offspring. Men could to a greater extent provide for the family by only mastering one skill. 

Think about it. Women have always been doing mentally demanding tasks, for most, if not all, their waking hours. Imagine having to make all clothes and fabrics, preserve all food, make containers from straw/clay, make soap, know about basic medicine, know about all the social relations in the villeage, know how to raise and emotionally support childre. e.g). So genetics might be one explenation.

Most jobs and educations today need generalists that are able to remember, process and combine lots of different information, and also master social skills very well. Specialists, like a phd-candidate may to a greater extent manage with only one set of skills and poorer social skills. That might explain why women sucseed more in education over all, while most prominent specialistsand leaders are men. 

The other one is cultural. For instance girls are to a greater extent expected to sit still and do quietly as they are told, while young boys to a greater extend have their behaviour excuses when they don’t concentrate or do as they please. This might come back to bite them when they are 18 and haven’t payed attention in school. This explenation would not explain why men are still overrepresented among the «best» within most fields, but see my disgussion of the mental factors above.",,/r/europe/comments/ffri0b/females_ages_3034_and_males_ages_3034_with_higher/fk0e37i/,MinorSpider,1583753862

4856,"I mean, it shouldn't be a surprise that the population of the country that was ultimately most destroyed and literally separated after WW2 takes a softer stance to the plight of refugees. While the historical narrative in most other countries from primary school onwards concentrated on 'Germany bad' (not without reason of course) within Germany the focus has been on 'look at all this suffering'. A different mentality has taken hold.

There's also something to dislike about the narrative in every thread on /r/Europe when it comes to refugees. It was already stated somewhere that the majority or so of the people stuck in Turkey are Afghans. Not exactly fair to consider these people mere economic migrants after war ravaged their country almost non-stop since 1979. There also seems to be a complete lack of perspective or foresight when it comes to economic migration. Throughout all of human history people have flocked to live along trade routes and areas with strong industrial development because there's more opportunity there. It is likely that people from war-torn areas and especially places with no natural resources, sparse populations and no industry will try and come to places like Europe. Especially in our globalised, ever-smaller world.

It's not all bad either. In my direct social circle I know of a surgeon and pharmacist who's parents fled here as poor immigrants from Vietnam and Afghanistan in the late 1970s respectively. Both now on the top-end of net contributors to our society.

&gt;  
&gt;Although the dual education system seems promising at partnering future employees with potential jobs in their industry, it does not mean every country can simply create a dual education system within their borders. The system is successful in Germany because VET (the model for dual education) is regulated and strongly funded by both the federal government and German states and works closely with the German industry for maximum success.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_education_system#cite_note-wenr.wes.org-13) The model is unlikely to easily be adapted in other countries for a variety of reasons. Firstly, the high degree of success can be attributed to Germany's long-historical culture of apprenticeships. This system was grown in Germany over a period of time under very specific conditions and cannot easily be adapted in other modernized countries.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_education_system#cite_note-14) One important degree of the dual education system is the high standard of education provided by the German government in Germany. This allows apprentices to not only specialize early on but maintain the basic education needed to react flexibly in the future. Another important aspect is that in other developed or developing countries, large social problems exist which prevent the creation or minimize the effectiveness of a potential dual education system. High-college costs and economic inequality mean that the local government must provide even more for certain individuals to succeed for the system to work.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_education_system#cite_note-handelsblatt.com-15) Finally, the long culture of apprenticeship makes sense in Germany but produces social stigmas in other foreign nations as it seen as inferior as opposed to the traditional educational pathway.

*'It's like war surgery. You only try to save the lives of those who can do it.' Christian Salaroli, anaesthetist at the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, in an interview with Corriere della sera explains that the Coronavirus emergency in Lombard hospitals is now putting many doctors in front of dramatic choices about who to save: 'It is decided by age, and by health conditions. As in all war situations'.*


'It's decided by age, and health conditions. As in all war situations.' This is how Christian Salaroli, an anaesthetist and resuscitator of the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, summarizes the situation. In an interview with the ""Corriere della sera"" the medical director, 48 years old, explains that the health system in Lombardy, because of the Coronavirus emergency, has already reached a point where doctors are forced to assess who could respond better to treatment: 'Since unfortunately there is a disproportion between hospital resources, beds in intensive care and the critically ill, not all are intubated. The choice is made in an emergency room used for mass events, where only patients with the Covid-19 are allowed in. 


The dramatic choice, also made on the basis of the intensivist doctor, is made on the basis of age, the general picture and the ""ability of the patient to recover from a resuscitation operation"": 'If a person between 80 and 95 years of age has a serious respiratory insufficiency - says the doctor to the Corsera - it is likely that you will not proceed. If he has a multi-organic insufficiency of more than three vital organs, it means that he has a mortality rate of one hundred percent. Now he's gone"".


**The doctor: Stay at home, you have no idea what's going on in here**

Words that dramatically sum up the consequences of an emergency that someone, like those who go out and behave as if the virus is not in circulating, probably continues to ignore. To all of them, the doctor reiterater constantly an advice that has now also become an obligation for residents in Lombardy and in the other 14 provinces that have become ""areas of reinforced containment"" since yesterday, even if according to the doctor with ""at least a week's delay"": 'Stay at home - says Salaroli - I see too many people on the street. The best answer to this virus is not to go around. You have no idea what happens in here'.

**The death is caused by the virus, not by anything else**

What happens inside the Papa Giovanni Hospital, as well as in the other structures that have been fighting with Coronavirus for three weeks now, is that unfortunately people are dying of Coronavirus: 366 victims as of yesterday, 113 more in one day in Lombardy alone. ,They die of Covid-19 - the doctor then states in response to the doubts of those who claim that the virus is only one of the causes of the deaths - because in its critical form, interstitial pneumonia affects previous respiratory problems, and the patient can no longer withstand this situation. 

Death is caused by the virus, not by anything else'. Choosing who can be saved and who can't is a decision that discourages even the most experienced doctors: 'I tell myself that it's like war surgery - bitterly concludes Salaroli - You try to save the skin only to those who can do it"".",Italy,/r/europe/comments/ffs5ng/coronavirus_doctor_in_bergamo_its_like_a_war_we/fk087sk/,Gherol,1583746587

“The two citizens with COVID-19, father and son, 54 and 28 years old have stayed for a few days in Florence and have travelled to Tirana via land, through Hani Hotit customs point with a personal car. Immediately after showing the clinical signs and notifying the national emergency hotline, 127, samples were taken which were confirmed positive for COVID this evening from the virology lab of the Institute of Public Health. 

The two confirmed cases are in stable condition and are being treated in the infective hospital. Meanwhile, public health structures are conducting an epidemiologic investigation and taking samples of their contacts. 

Min. of Healthcare urges the citizens to remain calm and follow hygiene rules rigorously, as per our instructions this whole time.

We also urge the citizens to refer only to official sources of information. Min. of Healthcare and Social Protection with offer up to date information on the situation and taken measures.”

I don't think more unwanted children would reduce depression.

5006,"You realize that the CDC has refused to allow for automated Corona virus testing?  And that they have been turning away people likely infected by the virus from testing if they do not meet specific conditions?   And the government has refused to pay for all tests- which means that people without health insurance have not been getting tested.  Why would the government do that?  To try and downplay and hide the problem.

And yes, I am unhappy with the handling of that cruise ship where infected passengers were returned to the US, improperly quarantined, and the staff that brought them back was also not provided proper protective equipment and also not properly quarantined.  

What do I like about the EU response?  They are testing everyone, they are quarantining entire towns and regions as necessary, and they are openly admitting that there are problems, whereas the US federal gov and the Chinese have been trying to lie and hide everything.  Finally, 15+ companies working on a virus is great, but has nothing to do with the government's initial response to the problem- particularly since it will take a year or so to develop a solution.

As for why I blame Trump, it's because he's the president and thus responsible for everything his administration does or fails to do.  And so far, he is failing to lead and actively seek to find a solution to this problem.  I would be happy if he managed to actually step up and do something, but lying about it is not a solution.

German-Dutch Military cooperation are a perfect example how cooperation and savings can be done already.

&gt;If EU doesn't have unified foreign policy than what will stop France, Germany or other appeasing countries from ""giving strategic chance"" to Russia, after Russia invades Baltic states or Poland?

That's peak bullshit and coming from the Ukraine is understanding, but there is no reasonable argument for your scenario. 

Poland is economical and Security wise essential for Germany and even the Baltic are essential for EU cohesion. A reason nearly every EU Member increased spending after 2014. 

Ukraine is a different topic due being split political especially before 2014 and not  being in NATO or the EU.

In the first case, the F35 is at a reduced advantage, in the second it may well be at a disadvantage to the Grippen; this goes double if the F35 is using external hardpoints. Stealth had a good run, but things are beginning to even out again. 

The F35 is an impressive craft but JOTAMON is still in many ways a negative quality in combat aircraft. Having a few of them around for attacking said air-defenses and the later to use as mini-AWACSes, is almost certainly worth it.

5300,"Bombings were going on throughout the war, though naturally Germany got bombed more as their own air power began to weaken over the course of the war and left them moreso on the defensive while Allied production kept increasing and they began to be able to push farther and farther on.

The purpose of the bombings were not to scare people into submission for the most part, it was to tie up resources. A factory that gets bombed out has to be rebuilt before it can churn anything out again, men and anti-aircraft guns posted to defend cities are men and resources tied up in the guns that can’t be put to use on the front, bombed out railroads can’t support troop movement or supplies delivery and cost time and men and resources to fix. Accuracy being what it was with the time’s technology (terrible), you could really only be sure you’d hit something by dropping a heck of a lot of bombs in the general area.

It makes no sense to lighten up as the Allies are winning. The Axis powers fought well beyond the point where it was obvious that they were losing and each day the war dragged on meant more dead soldiers, more murdered civilians, more destruction. It would have been irresponsible &amp; wasteful for the United Nations to shrink back from bombing as a means to shorten the war.",Mississippi,/r/europe/comments/fff109/ww2_british_propaganda_poster/fjzduir/,sparkling_uranium,1583717403

5303,"&gt;I'm referring to unintentional bombing of residential areas near to the Port of London. It was allegedly the RAF who first intentionally targetted residential areas from the 11th May onwards.

The RAF didn't intentionally target residential areas until operation Abigail Rachel, the bombing of Mannheim, in mid December 1940. Prior to that all RAF attacks were against specified military/industrial targets. The raids on the 11th May were against road and rail targets in the immediate rear of the German advance.

The Luftwaffe ordered their first attacks on London on 15th August. A raid that was supposed to attack Kenley airfield instead hit Croydon airport, and a soap factory outside the airport was hit, killing more than 60 civilians. The following day a raid on an electricity substation in Wimbledon killed 15 civilians. There were repeated minor attacks almost every night from the 20th August on. The RAF first attacked targets in and around Berlin on the 25th August with Templehof airfield and the aircraft factories around it as a the main targets, with rail and a power station also supposed to be attacked. Most of the aircraft couldn't find their targets due to bad weather and so followed orders that they had to return with their bombs or jettison them at sea (the RAF weren't allowed to attack targets of opportunity until mid September, a week after the Blitz on London started).

When exactly the Germans began targeting residential areas in Britain isn't known (a lot of German records were destroyed). But prior to the start of the Blitz German aircrew notes indicated they were allowed to jettison bombs over London because ""something of value would be hit"" (Overy, The Battle). By the time of the Coventry attack orders were specific that destroying housing would hinder the resumption of manufacturing.

&gt;was withdrawn on the 30th August, with the Blitz commencing a week later.

It wasn't withdrawn. The Germans didn't consider the Blitz a terror attack, it was merely an extension of strategic bombing to targets that had already been planned. The Luftwaffe had been having an internal debate between the faction that wanted to attack London from the start of the BoB and the faction that wanted to achieve air superiority by attacking airfields first. The Luftwaffe's failure in August, with tremendous losses, brought the Luftwaffe consensus round to attacking London because they felt the RAF would have to fully commit to defending it.",,/r/europe/comments/fff109/ww2_british_propaganda_poster/fjze7yq/,WhiteSatanicMills,1583717657

An EU army is...well, it isn't. Currently what there is is defence co-operation. If there comes to be an EU army, it will basically be that but up a gear - taking EU member state military co-operation past procurement and training and on to combat, which *might* happen if countries are happy to make joint forces, and could (and does) happen without the EU.

None of these things make the EU a federal power. As I said, it's a co-operation framework, but I should perhaps have added that the real point is that it's a permanent one. While it exists only to enable co-operation that could, and can, happen without it by way of multilateral treaties, the basis for its existence and permanency is that if you're going to do a lot of such co-operation, it's much more efficient to standardise the framework and make it permanent.

It's easy to assume that there must be a historical parallel to the EU, look at the superficial features of the EU like the flag, the embassies, etc, and assume that it's something that has already happened that has those features.

* In tv, the dude in blue talked about how the Greeks took his clothes and phone, yet that only filmed his top body. The pics shows his lower body with jeans, phone in pocket and clothes tied around his waist. 
* Also notice that there are no people in Greek uniforms in the pictures. Why would the reporters not take pictures of them as they're doing these crimes?
* And why would the Greek security burn their clothes and gather them so close to the fire? It makes no sense.
* Lastly, if you're doing these highly illegal crimes, why do it right out there in the open in front of journalists.

Politicians know jack shit, and are just there to waste time, but sometimes, rarely, you get a guy that understands the problem and not just the symptom. But those politicians are 1/ 1000. 

Fortunately, they do have experts and, from time to time, you get a lobbyist eaten alive by a politician, using simple basic questions about the problem and pointing at the problem, and not the symptom, and proving without a shadow of a doubt that the counterlobbiists were there to witness of how to show that you're in the interest of fairness, not pro x or pro y, but fair and impartial.

5428,"Hitler actually set out the plans for the air campaign against Britain in November 1939. From directive 9:

&gt;Should the Army succeed in defeating the Anglofrench Armies in the field and in seizing and holding a sector of the coast of the Continent opposite England, the task of the Navy and Air Force to carry the war to English industry becomes paramount. Efforts will be made to secure the cooperation of the Sabotage Column and Fifth Column organisations.  
&gt;  
&gt;  4. The Navy and Air Force will then carry out the following tasks, given in the order of importance:  
&gt;  
&gt;(a) Attacks on the principal English ports by mining and blocking the sea lanes leading to them, and by the destruction of important port installations and locks.  
&gt;  
&gt; In this connection aircraft are extremely valuable in mine laying, particularly outside English west coast ports, in narrow waterways, and in river estuaries.  
&gt;  
&gt;(b) Attacks on English merchant shipping and on enemy warships protecting it.  
&gt;  
&gt;(c) Destruction of English depots, oil storage plants, food in cold storage, and grain stores.  
&gt;  
&gt;(d) Interruption of the transport of English troops and supplies to the French mainland.  
&gt;  
&gt;(e) The destruction of industrial plant whose loss would be of decisive significance for the military conduct of the war, in particular key points of the aircraft industry. and factories producing heavy artillery, antiaircraft guns, munitions, and explosives.  
&gt;  
&gt;5. The most important English ports, which handle 95 percent of foreign trade and which could not be adequately replaced by other harbours, are:  
&gt;  
&gt;London, Liverpool Manchester.  
&gt;  
&gt;These three ports, accounting as they do in peacetime for 58 percent of total imports, are of decisive importance.

The basic plan for the Battle of Britain followed on from that. First destroy the RAF, then bomb the ports and food stores. London was both the largest port and had the largest food stores in the world. 

The only thing that actually changed from that plan during the BoB was that the attack on London was brought forward because the Luftwaffe was suffering too many losses trying to defeat the RAF. They no longer had enough fighters to escort small groups of bombers to attack airfield targets, and instead decided to try to force the RAF in to a battle of attrition over London.

It had nothing to do with the ""accidental"" bombing of London (which happened repeatedly from 15th August on).",,/r/europe/comments/fff109/ww2_british_propaganda_poster/fjz3xau/,WhiteSatanicMills,1583710807

5483,"Very different mentality when comparing it to the Netherlands. This country is economy first. Cases rose 40% yesterday, and cases are spread out throughout the country. They don't know the source of the virus for 40 (15%) of infected people. They still aren't testing people with no close link to someone infected, public gatherings are still going on as much as two weeks ago. Nothing is banned, people who get the disease are simply told to stay home, the information from the government is incoherent at times.  I think the Netherlands will be the next Italy. That's where the 'economy first' mentality is getting us. Even my boyfriend (with COPD, asthma and chronic bronchitis, though only 22 years old) is still showing up for work, university and parties, while he lives in the province that so far does have the most cases.

We're a connected country, people work in one side of the country, stand in crammed public transport places on their way. I do the same, I live in Rotterdam, study in Amsterdam and my boyfriend lives in the south of the country. If they had been willing to simply spend more money on healthcare (testing kits in particular), we would be in a much better situation right now. I think somewhere next week, people are going to panic in the way I am starting to right now. Just to compare: 80 new cases in a day in the Netherlands is comparable to 1600 new cases in China. By tomorrow, the number of people infected will be bigger than in Shanghai province, even though the latter has a bigger population, and even though we've only really had two weeks of the disease spreading here (compared to two months in Shanghai).

&amp;#x200B;

So I applaud Bulgaria's government in this. Tough measures that hit the economy and possibly cause unemployment and bankruptcy will have to be taken to contain the spread and prevent even worse economic damage (for those who don't care about old people dying, because they think old people only cost money anyways).

Which also sounds like bullshit. 

My bet is that one of these is true:

* Someone lived in a small house and wanted to build a big house on the same site while living in the small house, so he built around the small house with the intent to knock it down and finish the big house. But then he died or ran out of money.
* The big house existed in a half-finished condition (wrecked or never finished) until someone came along, bought the place, built a temporary little house in the middle, and... as above. Died or went bankrupt.

Ireland's role as a hub for US businesses selling in Europe does mean the stats are distorted, when compared to the low population, but the hysteria about it is unwarranted. If Ireland has a problem, it's a lack of population due to emigration. Fortunately, business investment can (and does) hire staff from throughout the EU, so the population size doesn't deter investment.

Bottom line, the Irish economy is just 2% of EU GDP. The companies have real operations employing 10% of the workforce (250,000 people), and since tax reforms kicked in, their payments of corporate tax have tripled. Companies like Apple and Google have been in Ireland for most of their existence, and their massive growth has lifted Ireland with them. Where were these complaints when Apple was bankrupt in the 1990s (still with thousands of staff in Cork)?
