&gt;After thousands of people rallied to protest government corruption and demand a transitional government and resignation of Prime Minister Milo Đukanović, who has held prime ministerial or presidential positions for most of the time since 1990, the police intervened tear-gassing the demonstrators on 24 October.

In this case, the guy and his friend were driving through the town on the evening of the protests and, according to the police, failed to stop when waved down. The driver said that he didn't notice anybody stopping him.

About 20 special (not ordinary riot) police converged on him, dragged him out of the car, smashed the car and beat him up really badly.

The police refused to reveal who was involved (20 out of a total of 55 members of the special unit apparently were). The commander of the unit was there but ""couldn't recognise"" his own men. He was sentenced to five months for contempt but spent only 20 days in jail. Two members of the unit admitted to participating in the beating and were sentenced to a year and a half each.",Montenegro,/r/europe/comments/96dejt/romanian_riot_police_beating_an_innocent_antigov/e41hi0i/,Glideer,1534042606

Instability due to, again... francoists. But the reasons against the republic referendum are neither the economic crisis nor ETA.

Keep in mind that during those same years there were already 2 referendums to transition to democracy:

* [Spanish constitutional referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_constitutional_referendum,_1978) (1978)

The good thing tho, if we vote we can easily put an end to PSD ruling over our government. We won't push them away, but we sure can give a good lead for the others and right now we have 2 parties that are not corrupt and have the best interest for Romania. Both are gaining traction, even more in the light of the recent events and USR(one of the two parties) is actively trying and currently they have a project for a referendum, but one of the requirements for this project is that in 6 months they have to get 500.000 people sign and in almost 5 months they couldn't get more than 300.000 or so. In the last month they got 400.000+ signatures and growing rapidly every day.

1.  It takes a bad lender to enable a bad debtor.  The reason why Greece was paying 12% interest before the Euro is because they were a bad debtor.  Once they joined the Euro, the western banks took a very cynical approach to lending Greece money - they knew if they got in trouble, they'd be bailed out (vis-a-vis Greece).  Greece didn't miraculously become a reliable debtor because it joined the Euro.  No entity, never mind country, in the history of the planet goes from being forced to offer a 12% interest rate to only offering 4% overnight.

People in this thread who are complaining about the UK turning into some communist hellscape have no idea what life is like here and I can only imagine they have pieced together their ludicrous view of the UK from right wing publications, such as the Telegraph.

This is both racist and sexist unless it's okay to do the same for female professors. Assign a white male to female professors to teach them about how men suffer by not getting enough positive feedback. Or give black professors a white mentor to teach them about how white people don't feel appreciated enough for everything they did for the world.

There was a finn here somewhere posting one from 2004 that also cleaned a large area of forest in Finland. 

Today another landspout (I guess?) in another part of the country snapped a few trees, damaged some cars and houses and threw around some stuff (like a trampoline and a kids playhouse, lol). So no real damage, but still not harmless. 

But I got a good explanation from someone else here. ""True"" tornadoes only form when a thunderstorm forms a mesocyclone.

363,"As a kid I didn't find it disturbing, tbh. In retrospect, as adults, we may think of it as disturbing because we know how much this is like in real life, but in general that whole arc was really well told for a kid's show.

What it did right was not underestimating the intelligence of its young viewers. It refused to fall back on the same old cardboard cutouts and it showed a fantastic boiled down version of dirty politics. It was genuinely one of the best, if not the best, shows I watched as a kid.

For those who are not familiar with this particular story arc:

The antagonist, Dolf, comes back from a foreign trip to his home country of Great Waterland. He hears that the King isn't very popular and unemployment is through the roof. He sees this as his opportunity to create his own political system in place of the monarchy. He goes to the show's protagonist, Alfred, with the promise that if Alfred lends Dolf money to support his campaign, he will double the investment. Then, when he's in power, he will not tolerate any opposition so he can spend the national budget as he sees fit - including giving Alfred the return on his investment.

Alfred refuses and Dolf storms off in a huff, [clicking his heels and saluting as he leaves: ""Dolf is just!""](https://i.imgur.com/Spl93ad.png).

Soon after enough Dolf comes into good money and uses it to start his campaign, including speaking to full stadiums with cheering crowds about how everyone can only be happy if only the privileged upper class is eliminated and that people don't need a King or Church. [""Instead, all power should go to the National Crows Party!""](https://i.imgur.com/ngmjLyu.jpg) 

It doesn't take long for his coup to kick into full gear. The King's cabinet and confidants are arrested in the middle of the night on false charges of treason. [Dolf meets the Archbishop](https://i.imgur.com/oxCctyx.jpg) in the night to promise him a bribe for the Church's support. However, the Royal Family has historically been giving generous financial contributions to the Church, so the attempt - for now - fails.

Meanwhile, Alfred and his friends get in touch with the local resistance and he flees with the King to a neighbouring country. They start making plans to take Great Waterland back from Dolf, who has declared an edict that those who are not members of the National Crow Party will have to give 50% of their possessions to the government.

With Dolf firmly in power, the Archbishop now decides to accept Dolf's bribe. Dolf himself starts spreading his message of racial purity. ""For example, us crows are all black, which is why we are so beautiful! [There should be no white or spotted crows!](https://i.imgur.com/6i1qCRc.jpg)""

Later, during dinner, a mouse manages to sneak in and throw a piece of soft cheese at Dolf's face. As Dolf is wiping the cheese off his face, his inner circle [sees a spot of yellow on his beak](https://i.imgur.com/TsKzmFJ.jpg). You see, Dolf's closely guarded secret is that he is not a crow at all. He just diligently paints his beak with shoe polish to hide his blackbird ancestry.

From there things come tumbling down. The inner circle loses faith. The resistance manages to steal the money that was meant for the Church. Discontent with Dolf's reign is at an all time high. Now that there is no more money, it doesn't take long for Dolf's own soldiers to turn against him and so the National Crow's Party comes to an end.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/96iohx/most_popular_cartoon_character_from_each_country/e415yic/,TheFlyingBastard,1534029444

390,"&gt;Yes it is when all these economists work with big business who's only interest is propping up neo-liberalism at all costs.

Stop saying this. Neo-liberalism is not some word you can use that is defined by being perfectly aligned with the interests of business. If you're going to just keep repeating it without any evidence then what's the point?

Also you seem to ignore the real economists who do real macroeconomic work for non corporate entities e.g. Central Banks, think tanks (the neutral ones at least) etc. who do support the 'yuppy' phenomenon. 

&gt; They have no regard for the average person if they did they would be calling for a new capitalist system that's fairer and doesn't abuse labour, allow such vast amounts of wealth without giving back to the communities they abuse for cheap disposable labour (amazon).

You've gone on a weird anti 'neoliberalism' tangent, but i'll follow. Whilst very idealistic, it's not feasible to burden industry with such a high level of wealth distribution, and assume that everybody will be better off. It's very likely that most people will be worse off; the literature is there if you want to read it. Of course you probably know this argument.

However, it turns out that the guy is also registered to be blind. On further inspection they find out that 50% of the island is registered blind. So they go there and find out that there are no blind people. They simply applied for it to get the benefits.

SYRIZANEL's first international trip was trying to ""sell"" Greece to Russia (as in find alternative capital to EU one). I am not a SYRZA fan, btw. We have had more than excellent relationships in all diplomatic fora and in every opportunity since. We were also conspicuously silent on the whole UK poisoning issue, one of the very few EU countries to do so. So yep. 

Russia's man in Russia is Savvidis. You know it, I know it, everybody knows it. I doubt he's ever tried to hide it: hell, he's promoted himself like that. ANEL's political agenda has been the weird mix of right wing populism-cum-conspiracy theory that Putin has promoted for a long time now.

If you think that the Greek government would go against Russia for internal consumption like that, the Easter Bunny is not a huge leap. As for mount Athos, Russia has been in fact trying to gain influence as much as possible, especially since Putin has been using the orthodox Church to support his vision. It is nothing new.

If there is just a single paragraph that adequately summons up the problem and gives the solutions then I wonder how Greece could not grasp such a single concept and reform. 

Economics is complicated. Denmark is right now performing sort of okay (better than a lot of others), but at the same time the PM running the whole political show is financially bankrupt due to bad housing investments over a decade ago.

There is no easy way. Read it all and understand some, or do not read and do not understand anything. The choice is yours. I can not give you the answers, but I can tell you the oil crisis of 1973 was only a tiny part of the structural problem of the Danish economy. 

I linked to two papers and here is another http://www.nber.org/papers/w3372 The lesson to learn, for those that bother to read, is that there is many ways to manage economic problems on a national level. Greece failed, because it refused/failed to recognize it had a problem and when the whole shitty political circus show was forced to take responsibility it started a blame game (saying it was the fault of the Euro or Germany and they had to fix it), but that of course still did not even begin to attack the real underlying problem and fix their damn funding of the public expenditures.

The European Quarter is completely different and looks a lot like the Berlin Mitte district. All very modern but a bit soulless and no coherence in architecture.

Having a common language is absolutely essential to communicating ideas, so for now let's use simple well defined words.

&gt; Small-L liberals won't do anything in politics until they're acted on by farther-left or farther-right actors.

There's a degree of ambiguity here; do you mean farther than themselves or some sort of pre-stage to extremism? In case of the former, that would apply to any situation. People tend to not oppose opinions until they disagree past some threshold. It's in part because if we did we would constantly go off on tangents in a discussion, and in part because we have some sort of understanding that the person we are speaking to might have knowledge which we do not yet have and we might benefit from hearing them out and consider their views instead of immediately countering them.

&gt; As for joining hands, I can be friends with and join hands with someone who disagrees with me about, say, municipal building-height restrictions, but I can't be friends with someone who disagrees with me about who qualifies as a person or with someone who doesn't believe children deserve an unambigious commitment to comprehensive healthcare.

That's ridiculous. I'm not asking for you to be friends with everyone, I'm saying we need to work together on solving problems that affect all of us regardless of their political views. Do you think I care what political opinions the chef of a restaurant holds? No, as long as he makes tasty and healthy food, I don't care where in the political spectrum he or she is.

&gt; The resurgent right-wing in the US is openly arguing for genocide. The left wing is arguing for social welfare.

No, the right is trying to find a long term solution to the healthcare issue because they realize both the old and the really old solution had some major oversights. The left wants to reinstate the old solution because it seemed like a better idea than the really old one. Both sides valid notable points but unfortunately they're drowned out by the majority calling the other side names.

&gt; Fascism (and yeah, they're textbook fascists) has to be destroyed, not bargained with.

Let's see... many democrats want to overthrow the current government (a significant portion with violence as a tool) which is deemed illegitimate by emotions, are in favor of banning arms and mentally put themselves above republicans. Seems pretty fascist or at the very least authoritarian, don't you think?

&gt; I wake up every morning to reckon with the fact that literal Nazis are getting together in the streets,

No they're not. Literal Nazis would speak German and shoot anyone who isn't white on sight. If that actually happened the video footage would be all over the place. By calling them Nazis you are crying wolf. Moreover, those who are getting called Nazis will sooner or later think that since they are getting called Nazis either way, they might as well become Nazis. This might actually be what brings the US onto its knees in a war between the liberals and the pseudo-Nazis.

&gt; that our government has a fucking gestapo that's rounding people up with no warrants and locking their children in cages, while those people they picked up are put in front of illegitimate courts with no lawyers before they're deported.

Gestapo served to enforce the Nazi agenda by monitoring everyone. People were thrown in jail for protecting those deemed unfit to carry on the human evolution, most of them being German since those who were not were pretty much always executed on the spot. They were also thrown in jail or executed for questioning the actions of the government. Gestapo was a genuinely terrifying government apparatus to police ideas and opinions in favor of the Führer and the Reich. Not even the collective mistakes of the NSA, CIA, FBI, DOJ, DOD, ATF and HS come anywhere close to Gestapo. In fact, if your government had and equivalent to Gestapo you'd either be in dead or in a torture cell for suggesting the similarity.

What you're talking about is the immigration police enforcing the border by catching illegal immigrants. The children are separated to protect them from criminals using them as cover to avoid punishment. This procedure was introduced because smugglers started kidnapping children and as a consequence would perhaps never see their actual parents ever again. Also the policy predates the Trump administration, so you can't pin it on him either way.

&gt; Did you know that our police forces were originally formed (yes, literally created) to catch escaped slaves? They didn't exist before that. And people wonder why our police are racist.

Which by extension makes you a British servant of her majesty. So you should be at perpetual war with the French and attempt to colonize every island in sight.

It doesn't matter why the US police force was instated anymore, their original purpose is not applicable since there are no legal slaves in the US and the other laws are very different now. If you want to cling on to the past with the intent of reviving debate on obsolete subjects, then please don't do so under the banner of the left-right political spectrum. I'm in favor of leaving slavery to the history books.

&gt; I wake up to reckon with the fact that in the last 80 years, liberal Democrats have accomplished _nothing for the American people and have let the Republicans simply walk over them and us.

Well for one, Democrats (under Obama) unleashed one of the most potent worms in history (Stuxnet) to derail nuclear research in a foreign country. Not to mention letting the NSA get away with a slap on the wrist after Edward Snowden revealed their were spying on US citizens. That's got to count for *someting*, right?

Warning, long and ranting ending monologue below.

Seriously, you're so out of touch with the rest of the world that you literally can't see what we're seeing even if you tried. We have a distant enough perspective that we can put ourselves in the shoes of either side in the US and see how both sides are no longer interested in maintaining ""the American dream"", you are only interested in showing that the other end of the political spectrum is wrong. We used to see the US as a healthy country where ideas could grow, people were treated with respect, the justice system was fair and everyone had a somewhat equal opportunity of becoming relatively rich. That illusion came to an end when you started comparing yourselves to Nazi Germany at every corner. You see, Europeans know full well how bad they *actually* were and we still get the occasional *actual* Nazis who are literally loyal to the Hitler agenda.

Get off your high horses and start acting like adults. Maybe read a German history book or two, you may not believe it now but there are a few sides to that story as well (if it wasn't obvious, Wikipedia doesn't count as a book).",,/r/europe/comments/95l4w9/i_am_stefan_soesanto_working_on_cyber_defence/e40rjud/,Djhg2000,1534013913

&gt; The Panorama programme Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate examined the racist and anti-Semitic behaviour of some football fans in Poland and Ukraine ahead of the Euro 2012 championships and in light of UEFA's publicly stated policy of zero tolerance of racism. It was not, as Mr Ornstein suggests, an examination of race or inter-faith relations among the wider populations of both host nations. 
&gt;
&gt; The context of the programme was made clear to Mr Ornstein both before and during the interview which he kindly agreed to do with the programme makers. Panorama disagrees in the strongest terms that his interview was misrepresented. 
&gt;
&gt; The programme made it clear in commentary that, ""Jonathan Ornstein has lived in Poland for over ten years. He believes most Poles happily accept other faiths, but that football hooligans are yet to catch up with wider Polish society.""
&gt;
&gt; The programme used the following sections of Mr Ornstein's interview in the programme, all were clearly placed in the context of football related racism and anti-Semitism.
&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt; Mr Ornstein contacted the programme makers two days after it was broadcast in the UK on May 28th and immediately thereafter running on Youtube. He made none of the comments featured in his statement of Wednesday 6th June. We note that his statement was made following the programme's broadcast on Tuesday 5th June on Polish TV.

Classes with weapons, obstacle course according to NATO standard - these are some of the attractions that await the children of the patriotic-military camp near Kiev. The war with Russia, which has been going on since 2014, has left its mark even on the holiday rest of children in Ukraine.

The popularity of summer specialist children's camps is growing year by year in Ukraine. Parents are looking not only for a rest by the sea or in the mountains, but also for holidays to be an opportunity to gain additional knowledge and skills. Hence the popularity of summer language schools or IT camps where children learn to program. But the patriotic-military camps are also becoming more and more attractive.

This is not new, as camps of this type have been organized since the 1990s by both flatfish (Ukrainian scouts) and nationalist organizations. However, after the outbreak of war, military training takes much more space in such camps.
How to raise ""young idealists

One of the most popular is the Azowiec camp near Kiev. It was established in 2015 on the initiative of the first commander of Regiment Azov, the leader of the nationalist party National Corps and a member of the Ukrainian Parliament, Andrii Bilecki.


""Azowiec is a place where a new generation of Ukrainian people is brought up, hundreds of young idealists for whom honour, fidelity, family, brotherhood and homeland are not just words, but the meaning of life,"" Biłecki writes on the Azowiec website.

The camp is intended for boys and girls aged from 9 to 17 years. A 12-day stay costs little - 3.9 thousand hryvnias (approx. 530 PLN), even under Ukrainian conditions. A 50% discount is available for the children of war veterans in Donbass.

    A guide to the rules of the camp was created for parents. Drinks and curses, as well as all kinds of gadgets such as smartphones, tablets and GPS receivers are forbidden.

The children are mown on bunk beds. They can only talk to their parents on the phone for 20 minutes a day.

The participants stay with the wooden atracks of the vending machines all day long. They have drill classes and tactical exercises with the use of weapons atrap, they also practice removing and folding Kalashnikovs and first aid in the conditions of the battlefield. Plus sports activities.

Lessons on history, including the idea of the Ukrainian nationalist movement, and a presentation of the leaders of Ukrainian nationalism occupy an important part.


However, as the educators emphasize, hatred for others is not taught there, but love for one's homeland. Besides, among the parents sending their children to camps of this kind, there are many people who are hard to call nationalists.

    The important thing for them is that children are at least for a while away from the Internet, and the certainty that they have no contact with drugs.

From summer camps to the political movement

Camp Azowiec is only an element of wider structures. In 2016, using the experience of the camp, the Junatski Corps was established. On the Corps website you can read that it is ""a national-patriotic organization which introduces and successfully implements a new system of national-patriotic upbringing throughout Ukraine"". Who is a member of the Junta Corps? ""Junker is not a name but a way of life. They are children who grew up during the war. These are the children who will one day build a great Ukraine. Children for whom fidelity to their homeland is not an empty phrase,"" the organisation reads on its website.
Yulia Tymoshenko, photo taken in October 2017.


The Junacki Corps runs summer children's camps in Kiev, Kharkiv, Dnieper, Zaporozhye, Cherkasy and Kharkiv regions.


The Junacki Corps is the ""youngest"" structure in the so-called Azov movement. This one originates from the voluntary battalion of Azov (later the Regiment), which, under the command of Biłecki on 16 May 2014, carried out a successful operation of rebounding Mariupol from the hands of pro-Russian fighters.

Autumn 2014 Biłecki passed into politics by becoming a member of parliament, and Colonel Azov was incorporated into the National Guard. In 2015, the Civil Corps of Azov was established, which brought together veterans of Regiment Azov and nationalists. September 2016 Biłecki announced the establishment of the National Corps party, which in its programme promotes, among others, the idea of Międzymorze - a regional alliance with the Baltic States or Poland.

    The leaders of the National Teams and the Junacek Corps emphasize that they are not directly connected with the Biłecki party. Uniform",,/r/europe/comments/96i488/holidays_with_kalashnikov_in_hand_ukrainians_send/e40l5me/,sektabox,1534007410

Men and money are a renewable resource, and Persia had plenty of both even at the end of the war, and the victories of the Delian League were in the larger scheme of things minor, specifically Asia Minor. Persia simply needed to change tactics to make better use of their resources.

After the war, Artaxerxes and his successor proceeded to use divide and conquer tactics by supporting Greek Autonomists. This was incredibly successfull and ended with Sparta becoming ""Warden of the Peninsula"", enforcing anti-federalist and autonomist forces which were also, as it happened, pro-Laconic and dictatorial, with Persian money and support while Persia locked down Asia minor and undid previous Greek victories. Confederacies were attacked, the  Argos and Corinth Sympoliteia was disolved, and cities like Mantineia scattered.  Since then mainland Greece knew humiliation after humilitation, first under the Persian hegemony, then under the Macedonian hegemony, and finally under Roman hegemony, humilitation which we historically re-paint as ""cultural victories"" by bluring the lines, but ultimately was the dissolution of Greek political heritage under different empires, continuing with the Ottomans and only ending in the 20th century, if continuity can even be claimed this far.

In January 2013, the Sejm voted to reject five proposed bills that would have introduced civil partnerships for both opposite-sex and same-sex couples.[10] The High Court later issued an opinion stating that the bills proposed by the Democratic Left Alliance, Your Movement and Civic Platform were all unconstitutional, as Article 18 of the Constitution protects marriage.[11]

In December 2014, the Sejm refused to deal with a civil partnership bill proposed by Your Movement, with 235 MPs voting against debating the bill, and 185 MPs voting for.[12]

In May 2015, the Sejm again refused to deal with the topic, with 215 MPs voting against and only 146 for. Prime Minister Ewa Kopaczsaid that civil partnerships were an issue for the next Parliament to deal with

\&gt;Why not?

because it doesn't, copyright exemptions are pretty strictly defined unlike american fair use. You can look them up if you want. Basically anything in a classroom, or during school hours is fine. school probably just learned something new and doesn't care half as much as you do

\&gt; I doubt the school was monetizing it.

how many times do you need to be told that that doesn't matter, copyright doesn't work that way.

This does not help much. Academia can broadly be divided into ""two cultures"": the sciences and the humanities. Gender Studies is strongly rooted in the latter ones. In my experience most people with a background in the natural sciences and rather quantitative social sciences are not able to read an academic text in the humanities or qualitative social sciences properly (and vica versa).

And then you write you are a student. Why do you think that as a student you are able to judge Master theses, particularly those from a subject area you did not study?

That said, the paragraph from the conclusion that you have quoted does not belong into any bachelor or master thesis. If the rest of the thesis is like this, then it probably is a crap thesis.

That said, I will have a look at the thesis in the next days when I have time. If you provide a more accessible link to the thesis, I may be able to do so earlier. 

But let's be clear about this: One crap thesis from a potentially crap university does not say much about an entire academic subject area.

At some point the Spartans formed a circle to protect the dead King’s body. They fought so fiercely that the Persians were so scared that they stopped the direct attacks and were shooting arrows for hours against the Spartans till a pile of dead bodies and arrows was formed. Even now 2500 years later, if you visit the site you’ll find Persian arrow spikes. Both survivors were treated as a pariahs by their compatriots.

The movie is highly biased against the Persians and presents Spartans almost as super humans.

800,"&gt;Glyphosate (G) is the largest selling herbicide worldwide; the most common formulations (Roundup, R) contain polyoxyethyleneamine as main surfactant. Recent findings indicate that G exposure may cause DNA damage and cancer in humans. Aim of this investigation was to study the cytotoxic and genotoxic properties of G and R (UltraMax) in a buccal epithelial cell line (TR146), as workers are exposed via inhalation to the herbicide. R induced acute cytotoxic effects at concentrations &gt;40 mg/l after 20 min, which were due to membrane damage and impairment of mitochondrial functions. With G, increased release of extracellular lactate dehydrogenase indicative for membrane damage was observed at doses &gt;80 mg/l. Both G and R induced DNA migration in single-cell gel electrophoresis assays at doses &gt;20 mg/l. Furthermore, an increase of nuclear aberrations that reflect DNA damage was observed. The frequencies of micronuclei and nuclear buds were elevated after 20-min exposure to 10–20 mg/l, while nucleoplasmatic bridges were only enhanced by R at the highest dose (20 mg/l). R was under all conditions more active than its active principle (G). Comparisons with results of earlier studies with lymphocytes and cells from internal organs indicate that epithelial cells are more susceptible to the cytotoxic and DNA-damaging properties of the herbicide and its formulation. **Since we found genotoxic effects after short exposure to concentrations that correspond to a 450-fold dilution of spraying used in agriculture, our findings indicate that inhalation may cause DNA damage in exposed individuals.**

859,"Thanks to you for your post, I find our discussion very interesting.

&gt;Can you offer some insight as to why are you scared of it, or why someone else might be? 

I can try. Religions aren't questionable, they never were, I don't think they would ever be. If X's religion's god says the sky is green, and I say the sky is blue, then I'm probably missing something. If your rituals (which, by the way, sounds like old native american stuff) gets you to the point where you're sure the sky is green, will you accept my view of the sky as blue even though I don't have this ""higher state of mind"" that you have ? Maybe you would, but others ? Probably not. That's why I hate all religions, because no matter what they say or do, they always come with this definition of something bigger, something higher, something above the physical world and our limited view. But that's not all, because, when you have this unquestionable higher thing, suddenly you have a very good tool to control people. I mean, even Mesopotamian mythology had its version of ""the humans did bad, gods decides to wipe them all"" and it's the oldest mythology I know.

When you take out that ""highest being"", when you make it all questionable, it becomes just a set of moral ideas, a framework to understand the world and a definition of how you should live : an ideology. You could say that I think spirituality is a necessity in the sense that we need a reason to live and that falls in this category, but I do not believe that we need anything out of the physical world to find said reasons. We lived for a king, then for a god, then for the market, we've just been trading one higher being for an other, we've never tried to live for ourselves, we've never put ourselves, our community as ""the higher being that we should live for"", but worse, each time, we were really working for another human who was ""the chosen one"". That's why I fear religions : they're very efficient manipulation tool, and all of them, since the birth of mythologies, has been used to support the people in power. All of the current religions share the same problems, the same cost, but none of them were bad since day one. Can you prove that your religion would stay good for an unlimited amount of time ? I don't think so, and if it isn't the case, we'll be trading a master for an other, exchanging status, the dominated becoming the dominating and vice versa, waiting for the balance to go back the other way around : not a real progress.

Democracy is the right to question everything all the time. A true direct democracy therefore can't have an unquestionable religion because a true direct democracy can't have an unquestionable set of ideas, even democracy itself cannot be sacred, as the only people in power are the citizens themselves and if the citizens can't debate then there's something else that has power and actually takes priority over the citizens. That's true for capitalism, communism, socialism, anarchism, and every other ideology, it's also true for every religion. A questionable religion that accept the superior legitimacy of the humans' laws (even the non-believers) would be a paradox, you can't have ideas so strong that they define your view of the universe and at the same time accept that there's other ideas that are superior. That's why to me, the French view of religions is the good one : people should have the right to believe, we should do as much as we can to help people believe in whatever they want to believe in, but religion should be excluded from all the institutions as they would end up interfering with the democratic process at one point of another.

&gt; Isn't that the case for any new system in general? No dynasty has been  eternal and all species have gone extinct several times over. Just  because shortly all will be dust, doesn't mean it's not worth doing. 

This instability must be taken into account, but we shouldn't just accept it. Since the end of the 18th century, only two political systems lasted more than 40 years in France, every change came with a lot of blood. I don't think setting up a system knowing it will crash is a good idea, our goal shouldn't be to set up the next civil war.

&gt; But when the automation really kicks in, and life (hopefully) stops for  real being about ensuring our own survival and we jump up a step in  freedom, a question arises: ""What do we do now?"" We can't answer that  question unless we all come together and decide what it means to be  human.  

First of all, in the current world, automation won't stop the struggle for survival we still have, or at least, the only way it could do it is if it we got to the point where lack of buying power had a bigger impact on finance that solving poverty would and we're still quite a way away from that.   


Second of all, this is a valid question, and I think it's a question we should ask ourselves, but I think it's a question that we can answer with politics and economics, as we always did. Political systems and religions have defined life for thousand of years, and for a good reason : most people define what they are by what they do. The goal of life was to follow the good book and apply its principles because what people were doing every day was following the good book and applying its principles. Today, there's the idea that life is about work, because work is what people do for a living. It's so important because it goes farther than you'll ever do : the afterlife for believers, heritage for capitalists. But there's a catch : artists don't say that their goal in life is to work, retired people don't say that, people who stay at home to take care of children don't say that, because that's not the life they're living. To go even further : a lot of people in my family work in social institutions, they don't say life is about work either, because they don't feel like they're working, they feel like they're helping, like they're useful : that's their reason to live, their goal in life, to be useful, because that's how they live. 

People who feel like they're useful to the community, like they're doing something that goes farther than just ""someone told me to do that so I do"" don't tend to define life via the capitalist ""you need to win your life"" philosophy. The only people that do use this are living a life based on this philosophy, on either side of the hammer (the ones who are rich because of capitalism or the workers that actually produce wealth). I believe that if you change how people live you're going to change the way people see life, just like if you change how they see life, you'll change how they live. In other words : change the system and you will change how people in this system behave, change the way people behave and they'll want to change the system.

Therefore : answering the question of what people do will end up answering the question of what people are. That's why I believe that the change of the system is necessary but there's no need for a religion. If you take people who believe they are tools in the system, who believe they need to work to be good people, who believe that their social role is to be part of a big factory to help economic growth, and suddenly you give them enough to live without this, you give them access to food, water and a home without this, and you tell them that now they can just be useful to the community and there's no reason to give their life for the market anymore, you're effectively destroying their framework, their ideology, their way of life. The ""destruction and reconstruction"" already happens, without at any point effectively attacking them directly. Changing the system is about changing a few lines here and there, changing people is so much harder, so much more painful for them. Socio-cultural determinism, social pressure, these can and will make sure that the change will happen. These tools may be more passive and slower, but I do believe they're also way more efficient.   


People who today are saying that the 1% are taking way too much of the wealth are already on the path towards communism and are already pretty far from liberal capitalism, they've just yet to realize it. That's why revolutions take centuries, people will get closer and closer until we reach that tipping point, that moment where there won't be enough support for the current system and too much support for an other one and at that point, the change on what people think they are will have already happen.",Aquitaine (France),/r/europe/comments/95l48m/do_you_support_the_legalisation_of_marijuana_for/e407uqs/,Thelk641,1533992750

865,"&gt; I think that the most efficient way to build our dreams is to rearrange  the world in to a healthier system with the sciences and politics and  rearrange our heads with the tools and methods of spirit to align  ourselves with the inevitabilities of the world and its laws, and allow  the mind and matter to meet eachother halfway. 

That is the most important difference between your point of view and mine : I don't believe that there's a thing that we could call ""the mind"". I believe that we (as individuals) are the consequences of the systems we live in and the experience we've been through, plus the obvious biological determinism, and that's it. I think that ""rearranging our head"" shouldn't be a thing we do as it would be just fighting against the wave. It will happen, passively, but I think our limited energy is way better spent by redirecting the river and, by doing so, changing the way the wave go, rather than trying to do both at once.

870,"&gt;I'll never understand why politicians hate technocrats so much. Wait, I do, they fear competence and meritocracy because they can only offer smoke and lies.

They do? Where? You are painting a very lopsided image. I'm not quite sure if the author or the entire magazine are without heavy biases, but believing the best-suited person for all ministerial positions is one with the utmost expertise of one area of it is naive. For some of it, that could be true, less so for others. 

Day-to-day politics, away from the ideological issues, is all about managerial work. Between a 70-year old university professor who spent all his working years in a research lab, and a 40-year old manager who studied public administration and worked at insurance companies while simultaneously ascending in a party hierarchy, the latter is more suited to head the Ministry of Health. 

But to be honest, [looking at the Italian cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conte_Cabinet#Ministers_2), I don't really see the pronounced favoring of technocrats this article speaks of, not for the positions that really matter. And for appointments of lesser (political) importance, like the Minister for the Environment or Minister for Culture, it's the default practice to put experts in place. 

I suppose they might point to Tria and Savona as the technocrats, but there are many more career politicians on the list. ",He does it for free,/r/europe/comments/96fwxr/italy_the_rise_of_the_technopopulists/e407x0v/,vernazza,1533992836

And touches enough topics in his life? Is that a justification for waste of taxpayer money? Or the lie that is being pushed to 18 years old kids who think that this major will secure them something? Even if it wont?

Niche fields should remain niche. There is no reason to celebrate higher percentage of people with tertiary education unless that education is put to use.

&gt;Documents released Tuesday in a lawsuit against Monsanto raised new questions about the company’s efforts to influence the news media and scientific research and revealed internal debate over the safety of its highest-profile product, the weed killer Roundup.  
&gt;  
&gt;(…)   
&gt;  
&gt;The documents underscore the lengths to which the agrochemical company goes to protect its image. Documents show that Henry I. Miller, an academic and a vocal proponent of genetically modified crops, asked Monsanto to draft an article for him that largely mirrored one that appeared under his name on Forbes's website in 2015. Mr. Miller could not be reached for comment.  
&gt;  
&gt;A similar issue appeared in academic research. An academic involved in writing research funded by Monsanto, John Acquavella, a former Monsanto employee, appeared to express discomfort with the process, writing in a 2015 email to a Monsanto executive, ""I can't be part of deceptive authorship on a presentation or publication."" He also said of the way the company was trying to present the authorship: ""We call that ghost writing and it is unethical.""

&gt;""Monsanto has specifically gone out of its way to bully … and to fight independent researchers,"" said the attorney Brent Wisner, who presented internal Monsanto emails that he said showed how the agrochemical company rejected critical research and expert warnings over the years while pursuing and helping to write favorable analyses of their products. ""They fought science.""

Monarchy is essentially a dictatorship and before the gradual democratization and eventual unification of Germany there was war after war. It seems quaint now, but that's mainly because people find it hard to empathize with people who were raped and murdered 50 years ago, let alone 500. Germany isn't quite 30 years old and this is the only Germany worth celebrating. The one thing to celebrate about monarchy is its end and I find it regressive and dangerous that modern people get so excited about kings and queens. It's worrying.

There are just so many videos with them even saying that it's the government's (PSD!) or parliament's (in which PSD has majority) fault that our country is in this situation. Let's not forget all the litter they left behind after the protest. This didn't happen after the February protests, which were bigger. Now, who's more educated?

Maybe there are PSD supporters who are smart and civil, just how there may be supporters of the opposition who were violent. Even so, most of the violent ones behaved just like ultras and hooligans, so most likely they didn't even care about the message of the protest.

And the gendarmerie just behaved horribly. They should've singled out the violent hooligans and let the peaceful people do their thing. But no, they had to show off, they used a lot of unnecessary teargas and water and shields. They attacked people who had their arms raised and did nothing wrong. Why was it necessary to empty the square at 23.00? How can you say that all the people did was to fight the gendarms when there where protesters who protected with their own bodies the two gendarms who were being beaten by hooligans? What about the 16-years-old daughter of a USR senator who fainted because of all the teargas? Or does she not matter because her father is from the opposition?

And right now many non-natural fields are becoming much more relevant because they have started to adopt methods of natural science. Political scientists equipped with mathematics can now predict the outcome of elections in a very reliable way. Economists could predict very well the impact of a decision.

1262,"*Aesthetics, also spelled esthetics, the philosophical study of beauty and taste. It is closely related to the philosophy of art, which is concerned with the nature of art and the concepts in terms of which individual works of art are interpreted and evaluated.*

The study of aesthetics goes back to Ancient Greece at least and is one of the basic factors by which western art, architecture, etc are evaluated. To say there is no objective measure by which humans generally judge things to be beautiful is both counter-intuitive and anti-scientific. There are qualities in visible things which appeal to our innate sense of beauty stemming from our collective natural history. For example in nature certain ratios or shapes may inspire different feelings or urges in us for biological reasons, such as the desire to protect/nurture in the ratios associated with an infants face, or arousal/desire in the ideal ratios of our sexual partners. These among countless other factors are compiled and studied and art (including architecture) exploits from them to create man-made beauty. Artists utilize these techniques, patterns, and themes to create great art. Not to mention standards of originality, craftsmanship, durability, historical context, and countless other criteria by which art is evaluated.  To deny that somethings are beautiful, and others not is insanity, why else would the great majority of people naturally be inclined to say that this: https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/close-eye-paris-old-city-block-11006327.jpg  
Is more beautiful than this:

The problem is that in Romania, the majority of the population are either pensioners or people benefiting from welfare in some way, so it’s in their direct interest that there are higher taxes. Furthermore, it seems the more uneducated a person is, the more likely they are to vote. Of the few people who actually work their asses off and get sucked dry by the state, even fewer actually vote. 

This is why I think that as long as we have universal democracy, things will hardly change in the near future. The lazies, uneducated and pensioners will always support the corrupt parties like PSD which promise them higher pensions and freebies and as long as parties like the PSD will be in power education won’t improve because it’s not in their interest (as more educated people wouldn’t bite their bullshit propaganda).

We will sell software that does what we want it to do, and forget all about compliances and standards and that people use it. Then when they complain, discover the fraud, we just hide the reporting capabilities, close and collect next years license fee.

&gt;Similar policies were tested again in the UK in 2016 when a temporary receptionist, Nicola Thorp, was sent home unpaid after she refused to follow the dress code at the office of accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers. Outsourcing firm Portico stated that Thorp ""had signed the appearance guidelines"" but after Thorp launched an online petition—""Make it illegal for a company to require women to wear high heels at work""—the firm changed their policy. The new guideline states that all female employees ""can wear plain flat shoes or plain court shoes as they prefer.""[19] The petition gained widespread support from public figures such as Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and MPs Caroline Dinenage, Margot James and Tulip Siddiq.[20][21] Two parliamentary committees in January 2017 decided that Portico had broken the law; the company had already changed its terms of employment.[20][22] The petition gained over 130,000 signatures, sufficient for a debate in the British parliament.[23] This took place on 6 March 2017, when MPs decided the UK government should change the law to prevent the demand being made by employers.[24][22] However, this was rejected by the government in April 2017 as they stated that existing legislation was ""adequate"".

1541,"Fitch on Friday upgraded Greece’s long-term foreign currency rating by two notches to BB- from B with a stable outlook, citing improving public finances and relations with European creditors.

Analysts noted that with the final review of the Greece’s European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme completed, the path has been cleared for a successful exit from the ESM programme later this month.

“The accompanying debt measures improve general government debt sustainability,” Fitch said, adding: “Fitch believes that debt sustainability is also underpinned by a record of general government primary surpluses, our expectation of sustained GDP growth; additional fiscal measures legislated to take effect through 2020 and somewhat reduced political risks.”

The rating agency pointed to improvements in the nation’s public finances, noting they had projected a primary surplus of 1.9 per cent of GDP last year, which Greece topped with a surplus of 4 per cent of GDP.

Fitch added:

The domestic political backdrop has become somewhat more stable and the working relationship between Greece and European creditors has substantially improved, lowering the risk of a future government sharply reversing policy measures adopted under the ESM programme.

Friday’s upgrade leaves Greece three notches away from attaining investment grade status.

Your ""new religion"" isn't something I hope for, it's more something that scares me. I come from a very anti-religious culture, I'm way more happy to see religious ideas going away than I would be if a new one popped up and started to catch wind.   


I agree on the idea that the revolution can't stop just at the economical system and that there's something way more general, way more important outside of the technically of ""how do we organise our lives"", but I think that this change, to be of any real use, can't be from one box to an other. We can't swap religions and call it progress, because on the grand scheme of things, we would be repeating the same mistakes, creating a pseudo-stable system for now knowing that it will fall down in a close-future. Just wait for people to be against the new religion and voilà you're back to square one with an unstable system and a crash waiting to happen.

We're kind of an experts on addressing demographics. I kid, I kid. 

&gt;And it's not like after it gets it Kosovars would just sit there peacefully. Terrorist attacks would become a daily occurrence and the Serbian state might go full authoritarian under the premise of restoring order.

Maybe, maybe not. I'm fairly certain that the terrorists got to work when they were promised a win. There was always some tension and violence, but it was manageable before '98.

&gt;That's why I speak of a miraculous scenario where Serbia somehow gets Kosovo peacefully. In such a case Western relations would be better and Serbia would probably pursue EU membership, something that it can devote more attention now that Kosovo has been solved. To the dismay of Russia.

These ""edge cases"" are the exact situation where their reporting is crucial. It isn't crucial when they are talking about favourite names in Britain.

The BBC is a far cry from the .rt, but it still is a ""government-owned"" organisation that can be bent to their will. It also caters to a western audience due to the western values of its personnel.

From your world view, because you are a ""Westerner"" in terms of culture, you see their approach to things as the cultural norm. Most Saudis will not. Most Russians will not.

1809,"&gt; That's a pretty big If. 

Doesn't seem like a big if to me to assume Russia cares more about Serbia's EU accession than rejoining it with Kosovo and that it would act on it.    

&gt;Not to us, to us Russia has been the most straightforward,    

You have a lot of Russian presence in your media and the discussions that it spurs. I don't think the info that comes from there is straightforward or honest. The beliefs that Russia is helping Serbia a lot or the scaremongering about the West that Russian encourages also isn't honest. As a whole the path that Russia would have Serbia take isn't in Serbia's interest and Russia knows it but tries to make it look otherwise.     

It's not very honest that they block some of your exports or charge you so much for gas either while claiming to be partners.   

&gt;So? 

So at the time Yugoslavia was collapsing and everyone wanted their own nation. Kosovo was a likely candidate for that. If anything Montenegro had the weakest arguments. Anyway this topic isn't very relevant to our discussion and it likely wouldn't go anywhere.   

&gt;And we didn't, you did.   

What? Are you talking about our president? I'll have you know he doesn't do much besides having tea with foreign leaders and even if I consider him a Russian doormat he's still much more Western aligned and less Russophilic than Vucic so it's weird to say that we did and you didn't. And even if that were so that doesn't change my argument which is that from Russia's point of view you *could*.   

&gt;and that our politicians would have a spine to go anti-EU as the most recently joined candidate in that hypothethical.    

Serbian politicians seems to be spiny in regards to the West maybe because they prioritise the nationalistic reactions they would get from their base over the relational consequences.    

And while your logic seems true in Eastern EU it's the states that get the most financial assistance like Poland or Hungary that are the most antagonistic. ",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/967hcn/russia_to_ban_imports_of_fruit_from_serbia/e3yjzrn/,ZmeiOtPirin,1533920340

2038,"The Turkish and EU economies are strongly linked. Turkey is the EU's 4th largest export and 5th largest import partner. Suffice to say that the EU is *by far* Turkey's largest economic partner. In addition, Turkish immigrants are one of the largest immigrant groups if not the largest in many EU countries.

Beside that, stability in Turkey is of great interest to the EU because of geopolitics. Turkey is adjacent to the EU as well as Syria, Iraq and Iran, bridging a fairly extreme gap in both wealth and culture. If Turkey were to become unstable, it could easily trigger a crisis against which the Syrian conflict would look like child's play. We're not close to that, but it's been getting worse and the current situation doesn't exactly inspire optimism.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/965swu/lira_collapses_as_erdogan_tells_turks_they_have/e3y3o0q/,banana_liver,1533906040

2040,"""[State TV (Staatsfernsehen)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_media) is a specific term used to describe state propaganda outlets like they exist in China, North Korea or Iran. Those are 100% controlled by the government.

[Public broadcasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting) works different, at least in countries like the UK, Germany or Austria. The programms are paid for by TV licenses coming directly from the people and not the government. The government has no direct say over what they report. Austria has the ORF, which is the same thing. 

I am not as big a fan of the BBC as some other people but calling them state TV is just wrong. And the example I brought up was just there to show that any news outlet has a bias one way or another. A British news organization is going to report differently about some topics than one from Japan. Humans are working there making the news, with their own backrounds and biases.

2079,"I totally agree with that criticism and fully acknowledge that there are a lot of bad and pretentious ""cyber analysts"" out there that take short cuts, don't do the necessary research, and promote their crappy solutions to a huge audience. This is true for so called ""though leaders"" - particularly former politicians - as well as those think tankers and journalists that merely cover cyber on the side.

At the same time, me and others that are trying to sensibly bridge the gap between the infosec community and policymakers have a very hard time to get our recommendations heard by the media, the public, and even by policymakers themselves, because people prefer easy rather than complex solutions to complex problems.

Overall, there are very few of us - and it's extremely difficult to operate in this environment, because we get constant push back from all sides and have to continuously fight against the animosity and hostility that exist in the cyber policy realm due to so many incorrect narratives, the prevailing tech-illiteracy, and sprawling bad policy ideas.

One of the reasons why I wanted to have this AMA, was to make a positive impact and to let this community know that there are analysts out there that really do the research and are trying their best to push for and create sensible cyber-related policies. You will rarely hear about the things that we do, because we don't strive for those 5 minutes of fame or a New York Times article that might be read by millions but is riddle with inaccuracies and provides merely a hollow one-liner solution.

I fully understand why many of you are criticising me and the cyber policy community at large. And I am not even angry that you do. I would actually wish that more people were calling out pretentious thought leaders and cyber analyst/reporters on their crappy ideas. What does not seem fair to me, is voicing criticism solely based on the absence of technical knowledge.

I am a policy wonk first, and I am really trying hard every day to understand and learn how we can solve a certain cyber-related problem. Believe it or not, the technical part is just one element - although a critical one - that comes into play. Meaning, I do sit down and for example dove into padding oracle attacks, collision resistance, or discrete logarithm problems before I wrote [my paper on encryption](https://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/no_middle_ground_moving_on_from_the_crypto_wars) (I even took an online course on cryptography at Stanford to help me get started). Most of the time none of that knowledge ends up in a report, because it is not helpful in the policy context.

In the end, cyber policy is a teamwork process and the work I do is part of the necessary equation.I wish that more infosec people would go into policy and more policy folks into infosec, but there are immense cultural and knowledge barriers to do so.",AMA,/r/europe/comments/95l4w9/i_am_stefan_soesanto_working_on_cyber_defence/e3y3wdi/,iiyoNicalite,1533906297

In fact, I'm surprised (not really) that it's not embraced by Western media outlets and politicians; after all, they love diversity, and surely a different point of view would enrich the discussion...

(Yeah, right.)

Anyhow, it seems to me, that Hungarians are no less or no more xenophobic than anyone else; in fact, in the UK there were 15X more antisemitic incidents in 2016 than in Hungary, despite Hungary having proportionally more Jews; and unlike in the UK, there were no actual physical incidents.

Same with the Roma. There are known issues with integration, and yet, anti-Roma violence is very rare. (There were four assholes on a killing spree in mid-2000s, though.) 


I think it's really misguided and stupid from people in Western Europe to expect Central and Eastern Europeans to accept their norms and belief systems out of the blue. Central and Eastern Europe are in a very different situation, and are a very different part of their social evolution. Things *are* changing, but people by large are more conservative, and I do think it should be respected.


As for what they think of Western Europe - I think the word ""multiculturalism"" became something of a bad thing lately, unfortunately. It's because of the scorn and condemnation that has been pouring from the West, especially since 2015, when the situation was dire. Instead of constructive help, Hungary got hammered. At least nobody blames the Greek while they are struggling with their issues of immigration. There was a lot of hypocrisy and double standards flying around back then; no wonder Orban was jizzing in his pants. He actually has a point about ""Brussels"". (Not that it excuses him milking the issue for his political agenda.)


People's attitudes, I think, is that nobody wants to see a huge number of people come from a different culture. It's a small, isolated country in the middle of Europe, and people do not have a lot of exposure to Muslims; and based on what has been happening in Western Europe, they are not eager to have similar enclaves. (The Fidesz media also fuels these sentiments, it must be mentioned. But they do have a point. Integration IS a problem in Western Europe.) 

As I said the newcomers who are in (mostly) Budapest are fine; nobody bothers them, and they are accepted. You can see black security guards, women in headscarfs, East Asian children talking trash in Hungarian... it's actually nice, and a big change from 20 years ago.

It's because of the scorn and condemnation that has been pouring from the West, especially since 2015, when the situation was dire. Instead of constructive help, Hungary got hammered. At least nobody blames the Greek while they are struggling with their issues of immigration. There was a lot of hypocrisy and double standards flying around back then; no wonder Orban was jizzing in his pants. He actually has a point about ""Brussels"". (Not that it excuses him milking the issue for his political agenda.)


People's attitudes, I think, is that nobody wants to see a huge number of people come from a different culture. It's a small, isolated country in the middle of Europe, and people do not have a lot of exposure to Muslims; and based on what has been happening in Western Europe, they are not eager to have similar enclaves. (The Fidesz media also fuels these sentiments, it must be mentioned. But they do have a point. Integration IS a problem in Western Europe.) 

As I said the newcomers who are in (mostly) Budapest are fine; nobody bothers them, and they are accepted. You can see black security guards, women in headscarfs, East Asian children talking trash in Hungarian... it's actually nice, and a big change from 20 years ago. But nobody wants to see fundamental changes.",,/r/europe/comments/95y0cb/a_feeling_of_apartheid_in_holland_a_south_african/e3xqzfa/,rambo77,1533884601

*Broadly speaking, apartheid was delineated into petty apartheid, which entailed the segregation of public facilities and social events, and grand apartheid, which dictated housing and employment opportunities by race. Prior to the 1940s, some aspects of apartheid had already emerged in the form of minority rule by White South Africans and the socially enforced separation of Black South Africans from other races, which later extended to pass laws and land apportionment.*

2478,"USAF once accidentally dropped a nuke to South Carolina. At least it wasn't fully armed.

&gt;As the plane was cruising over South Carolina, the pilots noticed  that a fault light in the cockpit was indicating a problem with the  locking pin on the bomb harnesses in the cargo bay. You see, back then,  the plane was required to carry nuclear weapons at all times *just in case*  a war broke out with the Soviet Union. The nuclear bomb in question was  as 26-kiloton Mark 6, even more powerful than the Fat Man bomb dropped  on Nagasaki. Great idea, right?  
&gt;  
&gt;Air Force Captain Bruce Kulka was acting as the navigator on the  flight and decided to go back and check out the problem. While pulling  himself up from the plane floor, he reached around the bomb to steady  himself, **but ended up grabbing the the bomb’s emergency release pin instead**.  Whoops. Kulka could only look on in horror as the bomb dropped to the  floor, pushed open the bomb bay doors, and fell 15,000 feet toward rural  South Carolina.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fortunately for the entire East Coast, the bomb’s fission core was  stored in a separate part of the plane, meaning that it wasn’t  technically armed. Unfortunately for Walter Gregg, it was still loaded  with about 7,600 pounds of traditional explosives. The resulting  explosion leveled his house, flattened a good section of the forest, and  created a mushroom cloud that could be seen for miles. When the dust  had settled, the bomb had caused a 25-foot-deep crater that measured 75  feet wide, and while it had injured a number of Gregg’s family members,  miraculously, not a single person was killed.

2494,"# Nordic and Baltic farmers urgently need EU support 

Agriculture is the single largest budget item in the European Union. Within a budget of more than €380bn, it is reasonable to expect a European ability to cope with crises and extraordinary events.

We hope that the Union will come forward with more initiatives to support farmers affected by this year's drought in northern Europe.

The ongoing heatwave in northern Europe has set several meteorological records. In many areas, we are experiencing the worst drought for decades. Many farmers have long passed the point where rain would make much difference – the damages to crops and grass for silage has already been done.

In many places, farmers face losses of half their harvest or more.

The effects are already evident.

Hay prices have soared. Cattle farmers are preparing to slaughter cows in anticipation of a fodder shortage in the autumn and the winter. The situation is also severe for pig farmers.

In addition to increased grain prices, there is a poor supply of enrichment materials. Thousands of families face economic difficulties when their annual income is dramatically reduced, but their costs remain.

Of course, agriculture, like other industries, must manage annual variations, and farmers should be expected to maintain a financial margin to manage such variations. However, the impact from the current heat and drought wave has exceeded dramatically any good farmer's reasonable expectations of preparedness.

The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has provided both security of supply and acceptable economic conditions for farmers. But the CAP must evolve as conditions change.

Probably, European farmers will see more extreme weather events, such as prolonged drought, freezing conditions, torrential rains. We must discuss how the CAP is complemented by mechanisms to manage such events, to avoid farmers being driven into bankruptcy.

Today's regulations in the EU are not adapted to situations such as extreme drought over a long period of time. Farmers are squeezed because of a regulatory framework that they cannot cope with on these occasions.

In addition, it takes a long time to get compensation, for example, due to the requirement of extensive documentation.

We welcome different initiatives by the commission, such as early payments and relaxed harvesting rules. However, it must be stated that these are not enough.

Early payments are vital to secure a farmer's liquidity, but they do not solve the fundamental problem of extreme loss of income. Early harvesting and the harvesting of ecological focus areas will contribute to an improved fodder situation, but cattle and pig farmers must still buy more fodder at increasing prices following the shortage.

We also welcome relaxed regulations on government subsidies, giving national governments the opportunity to intervene, but this must be considered an anomaly in a policy completely managed at the European level.

The Union has intervened with a flexible use of regulations before. Last year, for example, additional support measures for certain agricultural sectors, such as fruit, vegetables and dairy, were financed from the existing budget.

## Special focus on natural catastrophes 

While the difficulties from these sectors were common across the Union, caused by market conditions, we think that regional cross-border natural catastrophes should also be eligible for special consideration by the Union.

We thus urge the commission to continue to assess different measures to alleviate the situation for farmers in the affected countries.

The commission must start drawing conclusions from the ongoing event. This is not the last major regional crises for European farmers. The CAP must encompass mechanisms to deal with these situations systematically, rather than trying to get by through ad hoc decisions every time.

Agricultural organisations in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden have drawn attention to this crisis.

EU commissioner Phil Hogan, responsible for agricultural issues, has already reacted and signalled a continued willingness to find solutions.

This is very appreciated. We hope that further action will enable farmers to take the necessary farming decisions without being restricted by EU rules, which are based on farming in an average year.

This year has proven to be everything but an ""average year"". Instead, it has been an exceptional year. That calls for exceptional decisions.",Polihs grasshooper citizen,/r/europe/comments/9645b7/nordic_and_baltic_farmers_urgently_need_eu_support/e3xnakf/,SlyScorpion,1533878759

2521,"&gt;  Studies by our national sociological institute never show the republic debate as a main preoccupation for the Spaniards

It's funny you mention the Spanish sociological institute (administered by the Spanish government). In their studies they literally ask about everything you can imagine, except one thing: the preference for a republic/monarchy. They have never asked about it, because it's a vetoed issue. That's why that question needs to be done in studies carried by independent companies, like the one that OP has shared.

The only thing related with the Monarchy that the Spanish sociological institute used to ask was the [valuation of the Spanish monarchy](http://electomania.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/EP_Monarquia5CIS.png) (0-10). But as you can see they stopped asking about it in 2015. Right after important scandals in the Spanish royal family that made them fall into the valuation. Since then, they haven't asked about it again. This is how it works in Spain.

&gt;  But the republic issue is not in the top 10 by any chance, only 0.4% of citizens cite it as a main problem of Spain (you can check by checking for ""la monarquía"" in the link I provided).

The link you have shared is from question in which the respondents have to choose the ""three main problems currently affecting Spain"", from a list that has more than 50 options to choose from (racism, drought, infrastructure, Ebola, etc.). Only 0.5% of citizens cite ""international terrorism"" as a main problem of Spain. Only 0.2% of citizens cite ""the refugees"" as a main problem of Spain. Yet both are current main issues being discussed right now in Spain. More surprising, literally 0% of citizens cited ""mortgages"" as a main problem, yet it's clearly a problem for many people. 

As you see, the argument you've used doesn't make sense and it looks like you were trying to manipulate... It's obvious that when asked, most give the generic answers, like ""economy"", ""politics"", which are the ones that gather the highest percentages. This doesn't mean that everything else is not a major problem. People annoyed with the monarchy can perfectly cite politics as a problem, understanding that it is subsumed in that category as a problem that politicians must solve.

&gt; Now, there are four main political parties in Spain

[Preference between monarchy and republic by political parties](http://electomania.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/EP_Monarquia34partidos.png). As you can see, the 4 main political parties in Spain follow:

* 2 Spanish nationalist parties (PP and Cs): pro-monarchy

* PSOE and Podemos: pro-republic

&gt; But there is simply not the mood, it is not a priority for anyone (except maybe a couple of people), when we have faaaaaar bigger problems to deal with.

[64% of Spaniards](http://electomania.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/EP_Referendum3partidos.png) are in favor of a referendum to decide between monarchy or republic. 34% are against it.

2588,"Well said mate. There are a number of historians who have looked into this thoroughly, for example Eugenia Kiesling in ""Arming Against Hitler: France and the Limits of Military Planning.""

Basically her conclusion is as follows: The entire reason for an offensive by Mobilisation plus 14 days (Sep 17) was to take pressure off the Poles, who were expected to hold out well into the winter. Unfortunately, by Sep 6th the Polish front was effectively in ruins and by Sep 17th Poland was already soundly defeated.

France, facing a shaky economy, weak industry (undermined further by mobilising too many specialists in early September), falling currency, continued political instability and a demographic disadvantage of 2:1 in males of military age quite rightly cancelled the offensive. Any offensive in late Sep would have simply led to casualties amongst an army that was already ill-prepared for war. The regular army's 20 Active divisions were a screen for the northwestern industrial, resource and manpower centres of France and on mobilisation many had to give up one at least one regiment to help mobilise a reserve division, absorbing ill-trained reservists in their place. French Category A and B divisions were in bad need of training and many (if not most) reservists were being introduced to modern weapons for the first time since their brief period of compulsory training any numbers of years in the past. Some reservists even had their roles changed upon mobilisation to fill gaps in divisions. The decisions in the late 20's and early 30's to reduce the length of national service from 3 years to 1 year really came home to roost in 1940. 

French doctrine also needs to be taken into account. 'Methodical Battle' would have taken 25 mile bites out of the German front in a successive series of advances before suspending the attack and redeploying the guns and tanks to support the next bound forward. What exactly the French would have done with any ground won is another good question. The ground taken would then need to be defended against counterattack and the salient would impose losses the army simply could not afford.

On the German side, the of the line in early Sep the usual excuse of old men and boys is simply wrong. Amongst the German defenders and reserves, stationed right in the path of a French advance into the Saar, were 11 first rate divisions. Even before Poland surrendered the Germans began shipping more troops west and the relative French superiority (less than 2-1 in late Sep) was eroded quickly. By Sep 17th any offensive simply lost any meaning or worthwhile objective other than to shed blood for a political sop.",,/r/europe/comments/95ses3/attitudes_to_the_united_states_among_european/e3xkc0y/,Niwun,1533874868

&gt;
&gt;Heh, no. PP is scapegoating the country issues into what is an astounding minority. 

&gt;This country, and any other one, would have the same exact issues with or without these tens of thousands of people —and for many it's actually better to have them, so they can blame them instead of the lack of a proper project for the country, or even the EU.

I said, they are right on this issue. I didn't talked about their ""project for the country.""

Yes, the second part is probably true. You let those thousands of people roam and make it the problem of those rich welfare states in the east and north of the continent. It's easy to take the moral high ground if you make it the problem of others.

&gt;I know this sub has a big stance and agenda saying otherwise, but this is essentially racism and xenophobia at play. If these people were white, they'd be welcome, but they're not. End of the story.

No, this is not true. Why are bringing that up? Because it fits your agenda? Well there is the same issue with migrants from Chechnya, that are as white as it gets. 

&gt;
&gt;And yes, yes they're refugees. The people from this ship said they'd rather die than return to Lybia.

No, they are not. They are the poor, unemployed masses of Africa. They and their families have invested a lot of money to reach Europe. Of course they don't want to be send back. That does not make them refugees.


&gt;If you're a racist, though, you'll see them as liars, of course.

I am not naive. You have to question background and motives. It's not reprehensible on their behalf to search for a better life, it's negligence on Spain's side to open the doors to all the poor and expect the rest of Europe to pay for it. Sell your own house and give it to the poor, if you want to do good but don't force others to do so.  

&gt;&gt;Why should Europe pay for that imprudent negligence?
&gt;
&gt;Because doing the opposite is being shit.

Your new government undermined the efforts of Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary, Libya, Macedonia etc to stop illegal migration.

The tl;dr on that period was the no side could penetrate the Franco-German border and that any kind of offensive would have to go through the Low Countries. Belgium and the Netherlands were neutral until May 1940. That is, no side could conduct a viable major offensive without first invading the Low Countries. That was taken as absolute truth by all military commanders due to their experiences from the WW1.

...


Far into the future there was some talk about how the Nazis over-stationed forces into Poland and that the Franco-German divisions could have attempted to breakthrough the Siegfried line, but that sounds like something military intelligence could not confirm and something that would bog down too many divisions that in the end would most likely need to be sent North anyway to defend the Belgian border. Same thing for the air forces. All aerial offensive actions early in the war between the UK/France and Germany ended with the aggressors suffering over 50% losses. 

In comparison to the ground situation, the naval situation already was in full swing with the British losing an aircraft carrier and a battleship really early into the war and the Graf Spee  being damaged enough to be scuttled in December.

The ""Western Betrayal"" has little to do with France, but everything to do with the US and UK relinquishing their influence over Eastern Europe to the Soviet Union post 1944. As we can see on the ground, neither factor is too relevant in terms of current political expectations. France being seen as an inferior and less trustworthy partner than the US has to do a lot with modern military planning and geopolitics, but very little with interpreting history. Poland can see that France is too occupied and overextended with dealing with Françafrique and France has far more to get from them and than they can from Poland in terms of long term investments.",,/r/europe/comments/95ses3/attitudes_to_the_united_states_among_european/e3x0lzx/,ivarokosbitch,1533855526

2727,"I think it's great that you do other things to contribute. You're already doing more than most, so you're not really worth of criticism.

My criticism is aimed at those who believe they're entitled to waste everything, at those that don't give a single shit about this because they won't be there to witness the consequences of it —or will they?—, and that's the majority of the world population, unfortunately.

I'm just saying to limit that traveling to something that feels reasonable. And what's reasonable is not dictated by prices, as the truth is that if prices weren't cheaper than taking a train to make a few hundred kms, people wouldn't only travel less, but they would desire less to travel, too.

You mention the other things there are to do, the 'front we attack', but are you familiar of how much air travelling contributes? Planes are *incredibly* polluting. As in, whatever changes you do in your lifestyle, like idk, having an electric car, can easily become effortless by you catching a few planes a year (see [this graph](https://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/life-after-oil/how-far-can-we-get-without-flying-20160211/copy_of_kalmus02.jpg/image), from [this article](https://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/life-after-oil/how-far-can-we-get-without-flying-20160211)).

That's what I'm criticising, people believing that catching hundreds of planes in their lifetime does no harm, and that them switching to leds compensates. No it doesn't. And because people are naturally selfish, all this needs urgent massive regulation.

&gt;We live short lifes, and you're telling me I cannot even meet people from distant cultures and explore countries completely different from mine? 

You can do whatever you want mate.

It's up to everyone to ponder how much they want to contribute to that or not. And most people can live with that, of course; they won't be there to see it —but, will their children or grandchildren?

Personally, I would like my children, grandchildren, or grand-grandchildren, to know that their grandparent wasn't one of these selfish people —seeing it from their historically perspective— that contributed, carelessly and in every way possible, to the world they found themselves in, believeing the world was of theirs to waste. That's me though.

Please note I'm not trying to convince you to think or feel like me.

2759,"In their capacity as ministers, no. They organize and run their executive department (the police, the health service, the tax service, the military, etc) and write and propose laws that concern their department (well, typically the people that work for them do that under their overall instruction).

Though it does get a bit more complicated in practice. 

For one, in some systems, like the British one, the ministers are specifically chosen from among the people in the legislature, the MPs - and remain MPs even after they become ministers. So they do get to vote on laws (inlcluding ones their own department proposes). But they do it in their position as MPs, not as ministers, they basically have two jobs.

Secondly, in the case of the EU. EU law is proposed by the European Commission (the EU executive), and then debated and voted on by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU (the two parts of the EU legislative). The European Parliament is directly elected by the citizens of the EU and is meant to represent them directly as s whole. The Council of the EU on the other hands, represents the EU member states as separate units - each EU state has a seat on this Council. 

However, a state obviously can't vote itself, it's not a human being, so someone has to represent the state. In most federal systems, this would be someone elected by the local people or the local legislature specifically for the job of being a part of the federal-level legislatre (think of the US Senate). However, the EU evolved from a classic international diplomatic organization (like the UN), where countries are represented by their executives (remember how I said diplomacy is also one of the jobs of an executive). Also, the EU still very much depends on the cooperation of these member state executives, and those executives want a direct say on how the EU runs. So EU member states are represented on the Council of the EU by their executives, who send the minister most closely connected to the kind of law being discussed and voted on, to cast the vote for the state (according to the instructions of the PM or the whole Cabinet). So the minister again has two jobs, except here they are on two different ""levels"" of government. On the national level they are a minister that does executive things. But they also represent their country on the Council and there do legislative things.

Meanwhile, the EU has its' own ""ministers"" who do executive stuff on the EU-level. These are the Commissioners that make up the European Commission (remember, I said the Commission is the EU executive) and there run the EU's administration and propose laws to the Parliament and Council.

2801,"* The continual downplaying of our abilities has to be one of the worst thing about Scotland
* The people, the Universities
* Biggest difference would probably be our attitude towards foreginers we are more open to other cultures that some people in rUK
* The average Scot will be one of two people, either young well educated and open to other nationalities. Or they will be closed off, indulging in the old binge drinking steryotypes that used to be the norm here
* Generally yes, throughout our history we have had good relations with the French, Irish and pretty much anyone who had disliked the English/ British Empire
* Lots of good Whiskies and beers but its not a requirement to only drink them. Ciders are probably more common than whisky in social situations.
* Take out food varies from area to area, but you can generally find anything you would want to eat somewhere on a main road it generally consists of Fish and Chips, Kebabs, pizza or Curry shops
* Rugby is fairly popular but no where near as all encompasing as Football
* Obesity is a very big problem here but in recent years it has started to slow
* Gyms are very common, but the number of people working for the perfect body is limited due by the general weather here, very few people will see your efforts so few people bother
* I'd like to say that we are a community orientated country but there are lots of people who only look out for themselves
* Curry is easily my favourite form of food, and it is insanely popular here 
* Anime is a thing here however there are very few conventions specifically for it
* We like the Frenchies for one, but generally English and Scots are fairly similar
* Currently our country is split 50/50 for indendence so its about even, however the main thing is that people arent ""anti English/british"" its ""anti Westminster"" or pro Union
* I feel that Scotland invented/ discovered more of the things we take for granted than people realise. Looking towards the future we have a number of world class universities and are building a polar orbit launch site over the next few years to compliment the suprisingly large microsat industry in Glasgow
* Nope unless someone points is out, then I will either accentuate it further. I dont mind when people try to imitate my accent its almost endearing. However if someone mocks my accent I won't be happy
* Scottish educations is 7 years of primary school education, followed by 6 of Secondary 3 years of broad general education which covers English, Maths, Sciences Chem, Bio, Physics, Social studies Geography, History and Moderns Studies, Comp science, Art, Physical education, home ec [cooking mainly], and depending on the school Wood or Metalworking and Graphic coms) in 4th year you specialise into 6 of these then take exams at Nat 5 level, 5th and 6th year you take them further or do other subjects between Nat 5 Higher and Advanced higher.
* Sexual education is a mess here, some schools teach a full course on it while I didnt get a single class on it, it is faily taboo due to older people dictating culture here.
* ^
* Scotland is one of the places where the sufferagtte movement started so it is fairly well known to Scotland, in addition to this 2 of the largest political parties in Scoltand are lead by women but they aren't ""out of control"" 
* most are uncut, it never really became a thing here and there are movement here to outlaw it
* LGBT rights here are the very strong and generally you are safe to be gay, however there are issue with certain communities and lgbt safetly, its something we are working towards
* Lots of forms of music are popular here, but personally I like rock
* ^
* Race relations are generally ok however more impovershed communities sometimes target the polish migrants here as scapegoats, but generally we are accepting of foriengners and their cultures
* ^
* The police are generally pretty good but there have been a few scandals with them in recent years
* Scottish Unis are some of the best in the world
* The School system is pretty good but lacking in some areas
* the NHS (national health service) is very good with how little care its given by the Scottish Gov, note the difference between the state of the NHS in rUK as opposed to ours
* TV is alright some crappy shows that get far too many views, a few good ones
* Shortbread is amazing, dont personally like Haggis, Irn Bru is good, Whisky is alright but we still fry far too much food (deep fried mars bars come to mind)
* Curry, because its so varied and full of flavours
* Ireland yes, England no Westminster gov has repeatedly treated us like second class citzens since ww2, which lead to Glasgow having the highest knife crime rates in Europe for an extended period of time.
* Scotland is 96% white so mixed race families are less common but they are still Scots and are treated as such.",Dirty Scot Civic Nat.,/r/europe/comments/95cy2k/what_do_you_know_about_scotland/e3wsh9e/,spidd124,1533848264

2842,"&gt; So even if those estimates are correct, which they probably are, is it requirement for a country to have fully transitioned to its end-goal tax system in order to be considered independent?

I suppose it depends on how you define independence. It's hard to see how Scotland could become a member of the EU whilst the UK, outside the EU, was still running it's tax system. How would EU membership work if HMRC was implementing a VAT system that wasn't compliant with the EU, or if DWP was running a benefits system in Scotland that didn't comply with EU rules?

I'd say Scotland could become independent a couple of years after a referendum, but it would take more like a decade for it to be ""fully"" independent.

And of course:

&gt; [France] is wiling to provide [its allies] mutual military help in case of a conflict where they would be on thee same side. [...] [France] thinks it's in its best interest to modify the form of the Alliance without altering its substance.^^[[1]](https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2008/04/VIDAL/15800)

In one word: self-reliance. Whether you believe this was the best way to do it, that it was hypocrite after WW2 and the Marshall plan, or simply that it worked are not relevant to the actual aim of France's foreign policy in the second half of the XX^th century.

PS ^\(and ^edit) : France never left NATO and did participate in many NATO operations during its time outside the integrated command^^[[2]](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/defence-security/france-and-nato/)

2925,"Sure, Swedish society has a very strong consensus that we need to combat climate change, and everyone is willing to change small stuff in their lives to some extent, which is shown in measurements like this. But we will never be able to reach an actual acceptable level because people are not willing to seriously gamble with their quality of life, and politicians are forever bound to keep the economy growing. We might do well compared to the rest of Europe for now, but the attitude of people here will not allow us to actually solve this problem. If our emissions are at some point lowered to acceptable levels it's because some very unexpected scientific breakthroughs happens, or because it happened by accident. Not because we as a society made it happen, we have decided that it's not worth it. 

I completely understand why people act this way.

2948,"You're blinded by ideology and full of prejudice towards EE.

&gt;  Or did you forget the massive inflation that happened after the fall of communism and how your oligarch leaders filled their pockets while the population starved?

Poland has no oligarchs. Changes made at the time were painful but ultimately good for the economy and for the majority of the population. More should've been done afterwards, undoubtedly but the reform itself was good (execution was maybe slightly too radical but I don't see why anyone sane would criticize the idea itself).

&gt; Your concept of beneficial or not beneficial of the euro stems form the lack of ability to influence the currency at will like you're used to. But that is a very poor way to influence the economy, the worst I'd say, and it's very damaging to the population

It's a very very useful option to have. Our manouvers around it saved lots of people from consequences of the recent crisis and potentially will save from other global meltdowns that will follow. And again, it's not only the Eastern Europe that is happy to have this option available for itself. You're acting like the whole planet adapted to Euro but EE failed to. Not the case.

&gt; The reason to refrain from joining euro is because the piggy bank would be owned by the EU as a whole instead of the oligarch leaders, and you can't steal from it at will anymore.

Instead of the country that can use it's national currency as an advantage. Competitive advantage. Literally the most capitalist thing you can do.

You're truly delusional about the countries abilities to adjust, just like that. I've given you examples of countries outside of EE (and they're not the only ones) that struggle deeply within the eurozone. Your logic is that it's all their fault, cause they couldn't adjust. Sure, it is. My opinion is that countries should join the eurozone when they're already adjusted culturally and economically to participate in the project. Otherwise it's pointless for anyone involded. Good chance that forcing the introduction of the currency would result in another huge burden for eurozone countries.

[German army approves maternity uniform for pregnant troops](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/04/03/german-army-approves-maternity-uniform-for-pregnant-troops.html)

And I recall something a while back about her taking issue with an APC or tank or something not being designed with room for pregnant women.

I'm pretty sure that she (women's doctor, seven kids herself, history of working on family policy on Germany) was brought in as a troubleshooter to fix Germany's fertility problem.  Obviously, it didn't work, at least to the degree that people had hoped for, and she stated promoting immigration more-recently.

But I think that there are worse things than her continuing her efforts to find a mechanism to get Germans to have more children.  In some ways, the military might even be an admirable test laboratory — the state has considerable control over the lives of those enlisted and their families, so it's easiest to try out policy there.

I wouldn't mock someone trying to fight what I'd call Germany's greatest threat — its ongoing population collapse.  I suspect that some people think of her as a bit comical, because they think of her as not knowing what she's doing when it comes to warfighting, and thus the idea of her imposing her inept policies on the German military is laughable.

But if you think of her as a parent who raised seven children, an expert on public policy on fertility, and the troops she's inspecting there as Germans that she's trying to mold into shape to follow her example…*shrug*  Not something to laugh at.  There, she does know what she's doing, as well as anyone in Germany does, I suppose.

&gt; For boys, growing up in a household with married parents has a strong connection with employment and earnings in adulthood. Chetty doesn’t try to address whether family structure causes these different outcomes, or whether both are caused by another factor. But the correlation is clear: **Across the parental income spectrum, boys raised in households with married parents are more likely to work at age 30 than those with unmarried parents.**

&gt; But this is not the case for girls. Women from households with unmarried parents in the bottom half of the income distribution are more likely to be working by age 30 than those who grow up in households with married parents, and it’s not until parental income hits the 75th percentile that women are consistently more likely to be working when they come from households with married parents.",,/r/europe/comments/95tngm/43_of_births_in_the_eu_are_now_outside_marriage/e3wb3ml/,BacchusAurelius,1533834084

Now, I understand that's there's a cost. And we must do something. But who decides which front we attack? Should we all become vegans (as afaik the meat industry is quite an important part of the pollution we create)? I would certainly prefer that and continue travelling. Should we restrict cars and start enforcing public transportation or something? I wouldn't care anyway, I don't even have a car, I walk or take the metro. 


Some people value meat so much they would never go vegan and prefer changing other habits. Some people value the freedom of driving a car so much they would prefer to change other habits. Some people value travelling around the world so much they would rather change other habits. Maybe we could find a compromise, and everyone changed or dropped habits that don't deem so important compared to others.

Indeed. That is very well put - hatred is from the primitive part of the brain, which prioritises hate over facts. It gives dopamine rewards - i.e. immediate satisfaction - when engaging in tribalism against people whose only crime is looking different. The rational part of the brain (which studies have shown is larger in liberal-minded people than right-wingers) is the one that looks for facts.

In short, fascists are emotion-driven animals with no rationality, and I wouldn't expect them to apologise, since they will be busy trying to get their next dopamine fix from finding another way to hate on migrants.",Paneurope,/r/europe/comments/95vinf/millions_of_dollars_donated_by_american_and/e3wby55/,Methmo,1533834755

This appeared to show that the register was so out of date that **even in an area where major support for a ""yes"" vote might be expected, achievement of 40% of the electorate was virtually unattainable**.

3118,"The problem with Russia today is the lack of predictability, in my opinion. They're not hostile and not expansionist, but they do want buffers and ""openings"" (ice free harbors, access to the Atlantic and Mediterranean, dominance in the Arctic). I'll get to Crimea below.

Historically, they have not had territorial ambitions in Norway, but they did see the need for a buffer against Sweden (see Finland and Baltics). That was a real need, as Sweden's Empire was a real threat.

Where you see an aggressive Russia, I see understandable concerns, historical backgrounds and strategic interests. Crimea was vital to Russia's interests, not because they wanted some more land. Norway is interesting to Russia in some ways, due our location, but it's far from the Crimea scenario.

Today, they see themselves as ""surrounded"" by NATO, rightly or wrongly, but that's what they feel. NATO does have member countries and bases around Russia's key regions. It's not illogical to see that as contrary to Russia's interests. It's clearly competing spheres of influence, if not exactly a threat.

Regardless of NATO or the EU's existence, Russia is a pretty big country with lots of influence (soft power) in Europe. Today, that military power is countered by NATO, the soft power is not effectively outweighed by the EU yet. In my opinion the EU is not strong enough to oppose Russia politically and culturally in the areas where the fight is on-going (see Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, etc). If the EU was more federalized it would certainly have more power and pull than Russia by a mile. Militarily, European NATO members outspend Russia many times, so there's no doubt about that power balance. However NATO is not evenly distributed across Europe and the forces are in various states of readiness (see NATO's new 30-30-30 plan).

If NATO stopped existing, I believe Russia wouldn't be invading Norway any time soon. They might take the Baltic states though.",Norway,/r/europe/comments/95mdf4/military_spending_per_capita_in_europe/e3w22o8/,nod23c,1533826828

European import regulations don't really care wether the toxic waste of the factory in which the product was produced was properly disposed of or dumped in the nearest river

In a simple trade scenario the UK is free to allow its companies to dump their waste into the river. In a single market in goods scenario EU law still applies and they can't allow their companies to dump waste into the river.

Nearly all regulations that mandate something in the production process but don't change the end product apply in the single market scenario, but don't apply in a trade scenario

And as for product specifications themselves:

In a simple trade scenario only products destined for the EU have to follow EU regulations.

In a single market scenario all products have to follow EU regulations.

For most goods, companies would follow EU regulations for their entire production even in the simple trade scenario because it's cheaper than having an EU product and a non-EU product.

3237,"&gt; People actually do care about the facts and they are interested to look at them because it makes them feel good about themselves, like they are ""active participants"" because they spent 20 minutes on verifying the facts. They just want someone to show those sources to them on a silver plate, but they do care.

I understand that very well. Western society is much more transparent for me that Ukrainian for you - because of language and cultural influence. And such attitude makes them easy victims for propaganda. They consume the easily available information and don't gig deeper, don't check the facts - just because this topic is far less important than local things. RT and other official media is just the top of the iceberg. Social networks, Russian and fake ""Ukrainian"" bots on all the popular sites, including Reddit, paid professional journalists - this all makes it possible to implant any idea and then supply this with fake facts.

&gt; Which ""good old flag"" or ""anthem"" was introduced into the popular usage by people directly (not indirectly) responsible for this?

First of all, ""Glory to Ukraine"" wasn't introduced by UPA. It was used before and after, so your question is incorrect. You already was told about that. If you like to associate it with that period - it's your personal opinion, which was created by Russian propaganda. That's what I'm trying to tell you and you're ignoring.

But if you want an example - take Union Jack - the symbol of colonialism, widely used in popular culture. It was adopted in 19th century, when UK was the largest colonial empire. Take the flag of Belgium, which was adopted right before the genocide in Kongo. The whole modern Europe was built during that period and all the symbols and cultural features are still there.

&gt; It's pain and blood of Poland, Israel and Hungary - of those bloody Westerners who dare to care about the memory of their victims.

Wow! Did you just equalized the neutral and historical ""Glory to Ukraine"" to Volyn and Hitler? It's beyond any reasons. 

But if you want to switch to the topic of UPA, I will briefly describe my point here. They considered controversial in Ukraine. Not positive, not negative. They acted on occupied lands - occupied by USSR, Germany and Poland. They did terrible things, but they also fought for our land when it was almost hopeless. Many people here think that it's overweights everything bad. And now, when Russia occupied our land again, this topic became much more important. Personally I would prefer having history, not myths. Not a myth about holy UPA and not a myth about all bad nazi UPA. So I will never agree with anyone who is trying to promote one myth or another.
I will repeat again - you can't re-write our history. You can't cut out everything which doesn't correspond to your black and white picture. You told that this is a pain and blood of Poles. OK. I can agree with that. Still no one asks Poles to stop glorifying Pilsudsky. No one talks about centuries of oppression of Ukrainians under Polish rule, Pacification and Vistula operation. Why such selective attitude? Your agenda about UPA and ""Glory to Ukraine"" is artificially created by Russian propaganda, which you're trying to deny.

&gt; But the reality is exactly the opposite - people on the West get only strapes of Russian propaganda.

But it's obvious that you're wrong. You don't even realize it, but you're talking in context of Russian propaganda. Things started to improve only 1-1.5 years ago. And still people talk about neo-nazis ruling Ukraine, civil war, nazi greeting ""Glory to Ukraine"" and other bullshit! This whole post and topic is about it! The only difference between Russian propaganda in Western Counties and Ukraine is that they invest more into West and their approach is much more delicate. There's enough information about that, including interviews with people who does that for living.

&gt; And you know what? I have never met a single person (I mean face to face, internet trolls don't count) who believed the Russian version of MH-17 shotdown.

That's because this story was too obvious and because Western official are much more tough when it comes to their interests. If it was a Ukrainian or Russian plane, no one would give a fuck and Russian version would work. So all those fakes were created for the internal usage in Russia and most of the Russians believed them first couple of years, despite the fact that those versions were obviously fake and controversial to each other.",Kyiv (Ukraine),/r/europe/comments/95osd3/glory_to_ukraine_to_become_official_military/e3vuher/,lskd3,1533819848

One state legalizes it, thus it can be produced and retailed in that state as per their domestic laws (and maybe EU regulations if need be for a single marijuana market); other states do not allow its production nor its retail, but allow their inhabitants to go to Member States who have legalized it, and keep it (except, of course, in any flights, to have no risk of drug exchanges in airport terminals).",LusoFrench citizen living in the Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/95mtx4/kialo_debate_should_the_eu_legalize_cannabis/e3vurxf/,RafaRealness,1533820159

Yes, there has been a fairly solid trickle of information as various agencies and authorities have investigated the issue. There is a detailed timeline now and so on. 

I understand that the Crown Prosecution Service is likely to issue (may already have issued) an extradition request for a pair of Russian nationals too, which no doubt would help put all the various bits of evidence in context. Although obviously Russia has been hesitant in the past to allow the people it sends overseas to kill others to be extradited. After all Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun, the pair involved in the killing of Alexander Litvinenko were never released to the UK either.

3340,"&gt;Such is life for the oppressed in an empire. The Slovenes could say the same thing though. This isn't even counting the fact that they have over a thousand years of history to back up that fear, unlike the Austrians.

When did the Austrians oppress Slovenians? And back up what fear? I recommend you read ""Legitimation von Imperien"" or ""Legimitation of Empires"" by Herfried Münkler. Empires aren't as much of a ""prison of nations"" as you like to believe.

&gt;Also the Austrians didn't fight off the Yugoslavs, they lost and were occupied.

I am not talking about WW1 specifically. I am talking about the ""Kärtner Abwehrkampf"" or the ""Carinthian Resistance"", where Austrian militia fought against ceasefire breaking yugoslav forces, which ended in a referendum on the matter, which Austria won. If there hadn't been any resistance the area would have been annexed.

&gt;What I don't understand is why they didn't just take the land after WW2, given what the Austrians just did it would have been a fair price.

Austria was the first victim of Nazi Germany according to the conference of Yalta so penalising the country did not make sense. Also fuck off with your Austria hate.

Then also maybe the numerous genocide's he had gotten the habit of...

Then there was also that time he burned Kuwait to the ground, destroyed their water sources and committed one of if not the worst environmental atrocities in human history. I grew up breathing the soot from the fires half way across the planet... so did you.

Maybe its worth mentioning the times he waged wars for vengeance, regardless of who's support he had at the time.

I don't know man... A million people and a remnant mercenary group seems like a devastating result... But then we don't really know the alternative. ISIL is a bunch of puppies and kittens compared to that man and Saddam's deathtoll was well over a million.

Then there's also the fact that natural resources are a good reason for war, maybe not from a Kantian perspective, thankfully we aren't all that naive. Billions of barrels of oil burned and spilled is a global disaster of epic proportions. Billions of barrels of oil is enough to lift nations out of poverty, enough to save millions from starvation... enough to keep oil prices stable.

3367,"To think that a French offensive into the Saarland would have changed the outcome of the Polish campaign is grasping at staws. French divisions did, in fact, launch an attack into Germany, and were stopped at the Siegfried line in turn. The Germans would have won in Poland long before the French could have broken through, especially with the Soviet attack in full swing. The decision of French commanders to follow a defensive doctrine was tactically and politically sound, should they hope to win the war eventually.

If anything, the United States screwed over Poland by establishing the new European Order based on the principle of self-determination, and then retreating from the scene without enforcing it. This in effect, left the duty of protecting the weaker Eastern European nations from revisionist countries on France, a country scarred by a cataclysmic war and with shrinking demographics relative to Germany. Entrusting the persevation of the European balance on a country unwilling and unable to do so was a major flaw of the Versailles system, and doomed Poland long before the war started.",Fryslan boppe,/r/europe/comments/95ses3/attitudes_to_the_united_states_among_european/e3vp7e0/,Arumer97,1533813089

3428,"But here's the problem: you **should** consider Russian propaganda, not ""while living our lives"" but while making your political choices.

Nobody has yet won in diplomacy by taking the stance ""I am right, they are lying, so I'll wait here and do nothing against their propaganda and I'm sure I will won because I am right"". **All of us would want the world to work like this, but that's not how the politics is.**

Because people in the West who have less negative history with Russia are buying into large parts the Russian propaganda, ale the strongest reason why this is happening is because there are able to use a lot of true statements there. There are other parts which they are not buying, because there are not sources (apart from Russian ones) based on which the Russian trolls could try to show them their statements are true.

If it was like you say, everything
&gt; they'll just invent it

then it would be very easy to counter it. With situations like here, when you consciously give them true statements or statements that have much truth to them, to use in their propaganda, it's easy to see e.g. in many political questions on Quora like Russian users (paid, likely) are very smoothly able to convince the Westerners that Russian propaganda is not lying, exactly because they have many enough statements like in case of UPA when they can say ""here's the respectable source by USA historians or French historians, see - they indeed confirm what was said by what have been you calling &gt;&gt;false Russian propaganda&lt;&lt;. Do you now see how brainwashed you have been, if USA historians or newspapers confirm our statements?"" 

&gt; Would you protest against the usage of flags or anthems or any other symbols of the bloody and shameful age of colonialism and slavery? No, you won't

I won't only for one single reason - because those countries give no other reason to believe that using those anthems is part of a larger effort glorifying of slavery. Same would be with ""Слава Украине"" if there were no reasons to connect it a the part of the larger history whitewashing effort.

In the political contexts when many Ukainian politicians from the whole lot of heroic people in Ukrainian history choose the most deplorable muss murderers of civilians in their whole history like Klyachkivsky or Shukhevych (I consciously do not include Bandera in this list) and try to pass them as national heroes, I *do* think it is reasonable to assume introducing ""Слава Украине"" might be part of the same whitewashing effort. While there would be absolutely zero reason to believe that someone using their national anthem is part of an effort to whitewash the colonialism, I think you should see the difference.

Or even if as a person from Ukraine you see that in fact after all this is not part of the history revisionism policy (in the end probably I do not have a reason doubt if you claim so, since you're the one being insider there), this is something where many / majority of the people in the West will believe Russian propaganda - when they'll state those are parts of the same revisionism politics by the Ukrainian government. And whether is Russian propaganda against  is Ukraine is **all the claims are completely unbelievable** or **30% of the claims are true and the rest is rubbish but the first 30% can be used to convince everyone that the other 70% is probably true as well** is something you - not as a person living everyday life, but as a citizen choosing politicians who might be in love Shukhevych or who despise Shukhevych - should really care about.",,/r/europe/comments/95osd3/glory_to_ukraine_to_become_official_military/e3vkzvm/,kirt93,1533805323

2. In this case, a big chunk of the US population is indeed to blame (because they voted for Trump), but this does not imply that you are absolved of all responsibility for the stereotypes you hold. It is your responsibility to use your brain properly. 

3. Moreover, in this case the point was not even about stereotypes of the US, but about the fact that your idea of the US does not correspond with the empirical reality, which makes you draw grossly wrong conclusions.

Also, parking perpendicular would pretty much end up guaranted with the bike squeezed between two cars, making it impossible to remove the U-lock.

Beside, motorcycles are motorized vehicles and are allowed to park in a regular parking spot in pretty much all of europe.

The idea that leftists are necessarily authoritarians is ridiculous. Are you aware of anarcho-communists? But, even so, what exactly is ""non-authoritarian"" about copyleft? It mandates particular terms of participation and utilizes the *authority of the state to enforce those terms*. That's, by definition, authoritarian. But that's not what makes it left-wing. What makes it left-wing is that it attacks a particular kind of hierarchical privileged relationship between software producer and consumer by establishing particular *rights* of *freedom to modify and redistribute the software*. The fundamental aspect of leftism is *anti-hierarchy*. Free Software is anti-hierarchy, as it removes much of the power imbalance that comes out of the privilege of the software developer in traditional licensing relationships. It is a left-wing idea.

* **radical** \- (especially of change or action) relating to or affecting the fundamental nature of something; far-reaching or thorough.

So if anything we have fewer problems with Serbians than with the others from that region, simply because we have way fewer of them.

The thing people complain about here in regards to immigration isn't about which European country people happen to come from, it's the fact that EU rules makes it too easy to exploit welfare systems etc. People shouldn't be able to move from Serbia (or anywhere else, doesn't matter if it's Germany or Zimbabwe) and claim benefits in Denmark, for example.

3826,"Hey mate, fellow Brit here: 

Do you think the benefits that come with leaving outweigh the issues? 

One such thing would be the effect of EU laws on us and how it gives back power to the government to fuck us over. A lot of our internet privacy and regulation laws are governed by the EU, for example. All of that could disappear similar to American Net Neutrality and Internet spying could become far worse than it already is. 

Another such example is consumer rights to digital and physical content. The American system for digital goods is a mess and the lack of rights they've got for things such as refunds is absurd. This is, once again, something that the UK could follow closely with after leaving the EU because of the fact that those laws and policies would no longer hold any weight here. The US population relies heavily on EU law to slap American companies on the wrist so they benefit. This was seen with GDPR and people like Microsoft or Google who aren't competing fairly or working in favour of their user base. Without directly benefiting from these EU laws we'd be stuck in a similar position to the US where we just have to stickup with companies fucking us over until the EU say ""stop"" and it hopefully effects us. 

At the time of the vote I was firmly on the leave side. It was only after the entire thing cleared up that I strongly stood on ""remain"". Fortunately I was too young to vote so didn't regret anything but I definitely found it useful to see both sides of the argument. I'm curious about your position on these sorts of things and why you stick with ""leave"".

3909,"In Italy we had about 100-200k per year since 2011 primarily shipped by NGOs based in Germany Spain and France, sometimes using Dutch flags sold by the Netherlands, with many Swedes and other North Europeans.

The last gov began working with Libyan militias to slow it down, then the international left got mad and posted the slave trade video, which made me wonder why they were getting invited to slave auctions if they have no contact with human traffickers. 

Italy also began working with the UN recognised Libyan parliament, and France was outraged so they reached out to a general they want to make into the next Ghadaffi. They are quite desperate to force us to take migrants.

It was going down because the French and Austrians shut our northern borders because the migrants they invited were coming through out of the country they decided to extort into becoming the world’s largest open air refugee camp. 

They’re going to Spain now, and just like last time the world will ignore them during the 5 years of benevolence, and forget all about it once the citizens lose their patience.

People count migrant crisis to 2016, in 2013 Italy paid out of pocket for all the migrant rescues because we had humanitarian leftists, nobody gave a fuck, then the Germans walk to their Munich train stations to greet the migrants their NGOs dumped in Greece.

3912,"You're mistaking migration of early humans with origins of Slavic ethno-linguistic group; one has roots in another but it's not ""just the same thing"".

&gt; What made the people in the area you mentioned Slavs

Language mostly; as a Pole, without any book knowledge I'm able to understand to the certain degree Czechs and Slovaks, as those languages evolved together in Western Slavic language group. Eastern Slavic group of languages (Ukrainian, Belrussian, Ruthenian and Russian) while sounds similar, evolved in its own way - not mention most distinguishable feature of that group which is Cyrillic script adopted from Greek. Then there are East Slavic languages like Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian or Macedonian divided in own way; again, some are using Cyrillic script as well, while other moved even quite recently to Latin script. Altogether, Slavic languages share their roots in Proto-Slavic language and [you can see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_vocabulary) how much similar these languages are. That Proto-Slavic has evolved on mentioned areas and shaped people, their culture.

Moreover, the group name, Slavs - Słowianie, is kinda *meta* because as one proposal explaining the origins of the name says, it means ""*those who are speaking* (as in: who are understandable, who use understandable words)"". In the contrast, Slavs interacting with people who they couldn't understand, were describing as *němci*, niemi, those who weren't understandable, who were using incomprehensible language, who mumble - thus, that's how the most prominent example - Germans, are named in Slavic languages - Niemcy, Němec, Nemec (in Polish, Czech and Slovak).",Poland,/r/europe/comments/95mnc4/comic_map_of_europe_2018/e3us14e/,cylonapplepie,1533769187

3931,"Knocking out the electricity grid is currently not what we are worried about. Some countries might be more vulnerable than others, but in general this is an overhyped threat.

Cyber terrorism is also not anywhere on our list, given that producing kinetic effects in cyberspace is extremely difficult. Thus terrorists, that are already resource and talent constrained, will not chose this difficult route, when a suicide belt is the easier solution.

I think the most serious threat in relation to cyberspace is the spread of insecurity, the loss of trust in government institutions, and the increased fragmentation of society.

In terms of megatrends: Climate change is pretty much the number one threat - but it is mostly tackled in the context of industrial policy rather than a threat to national security.
In terms of countermeasures: I am not really specialized on the issue - but I would posit that geo-engineering will have to be part of the solution.

On whether digital evidence can be shown to the general public:
That might work, but I am not really hopeful that we can scale such an educational effort to create a meaningful impact. Policymakers already have extreme difficulties to understand what is shown to them, so we have to talk them through every single point.

That's something you can't do with any certainty in an electronic vote and the potential for manipulation is way easier in the digital world.  

I'm all for public votes even though that opens ways to the buying of votes but it seems every democracy has an excuse not to implement them.

I understand that it facilitates buying votes but it already happens today even though nobody can't really prove they voted for a specific candidates, see the Dassault vote buying for example (just give cash to poor families, most of them will vote for you rather than abstain, if only in the hope corruption will go on). That's why the Roman republic voted overtly.

I know that's an old problem but going digital is only going to make things worse in that regard  in my opinion.

PS: printing a receipt from a digital vote has the same problem but it's worse than full paper ballots as you can't authenticate them if the computer printing them has been hacked, you can only invalidate all the votes from that machines afterwards and in a big election the winning party would not allow that, secrecy of vote is the real problem.",,/r/europe/comments/95l4w9/i_am_stefan_soesanto_working_on_cyber_defence/e3usywy/,m8r-1975wk,1533770071

urbs, killed a very great number of people, and then returned home in triumph('cum triumpho').""

The article is complete horse-shit. The title is complete non sequitur. 

Russia does not seize any new territory. Nowhere in the article does it even hint at that... And there is a [24/7 EU monitoring mission](https://eumm.eu) there which makes sure of that.

The article is about **borderization**.  After Georgia made their idiotic attempt to retake the de-facto independent states of South Ossetia and Abkhasia those states declare their full independence and Russia backed that independence. Ever since that disastrous for Georgia war, those states started to build proper border infrastructure - border fences, checkpoints, border controls. This is what ""borderization"" is. This is what previously were ""administrative borders"" and now actual borders.

Why is anyone surprised that those 2 countries which won 2 independence wars against Georgia (in 1992 and in 2008) would build actual borders with Georgia is beyond me.  Does anyone complains about Ukraine or Baltics strengthening their borders with Russia?

4081,"Well first of all sex trafficking has only been this ‘visible’ and known the last few years. When she was captured most people, at least in the ‘richer’ countries did not really know how big the issue was and that it was happening basically right by their door. Anna actually helped pass a law in Northern Ireland against human trafficking and exploitation, which raised awareness about it. 

When the girls were arrested the pimps had already fled the flat and brought with them most of the cash and laptops/cellphones. The three girls with Anna were basically brainwashed by the pimps and did not speak english well so they were at no help to the police. The police told her that the flat was rented in her name (the pimps had her passport etc.) so they just assumed that she and the three other girls were running a brothel, and there were no evidence to suggest the big operation going on since the pimps brought most of the stuff with them.

Also, the arrest happened during the ‘Galway Race’, one of the policemen said ‘It’s not a big deal. Girls and pimps often get arrested at the time of the Galway Races’ so I’m guessing they were just used and maybe sick of arresting prostitutes and just wanted them to pay their fine and get out of there.

Sorry, but your ""opinion"" does not equate that of actual chinese historians. Wu Zetian was officially Empress over one of China during one of its heights, and actually expanded its borders signficiantly.

Servillia was some noble in rome that had some arguable influence on Caesar.

The idea that the actual Empress of China during one of its heights would be of less power than some random noble chick because she gave Caesar a few tips, is patently ridiculous.

Why this happened in the first place is not entirely clear to be honest, there is even a [Wikipedia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_in_Spain#Causes)page about the high Spanish unemployment rate. 

The discussion on the causes tend to be affected by the personal politics of the person doing the analysis. More conservative/economically liberal writers will point to the usual suspects: rigidity of the labor market, unemployment benefits that make people wait longer until getting a job, labor unions, and the larger influx of migrants.

“The [border](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway%E2%80%93Russia_border) was defined as a march in a treaty in 1326 and separated which parts of the Sami could be taxed by Norway and Russia. The border line was defined by a treaty in 1826 and essentially remains the same border today. In 1920 Petsamo was ceded to Finland and the border became part of the Finland–Norway border. Petsamo was ceded to the Soviet Union in 1944 and the Norway–Soviet Union border was established. During the Cold War, the border was one of two between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Soviet Union, the other being the Soviet Union–Turkey border. From 1991 to 1999 it was the only border between Russia and NATO. It is Norway's youngest unchanged border. Since the 1960s there has been disagreement as to the border between the two countries' EEZs, but this was resolved by a delimitation agreement in 2010.”

So, compared to some of the borders in Europe, relatively stable.

4335,"I've worked with sex trafficking victims. In my opinion, it is insanely easy for most people to turn a blind eye. For instance, I saw them in Korea, and I talked to military guys that would go for the ""Russian"" prostitutes. These were young girls, not more than 25, ever. Do you think a Russian girl is going to buy a ticket to S Korea to fulfill her lifelong dream of being a prostitute? No, but when a guy wants to pay for sex and sees someone hot and young, they don't ask questions.

Generally speaking, if you go to an area where women are on the streets selling, there WILL BE a lot of obviously underage girls. Does it occur to anyone to call the cops to rescue these obviously unwilling child prostitutes? Nope, I guess if you don't see the process of them getting drugged and brainwashed and beaten by their pimps, they're just another dirty whore.

We think SO LITTLE and SO POORLY of prostitutes, that once we've got that frame of reference on a girl, it blinds us to her humanity. She looks young to be here. She looks foreign-- how did she get here? These questions don't occur because the only worth these people have to johns and pimps and the police, the people who regularly encounter them, is to be there to fuck or to be there to make money or to be there to put away and make you feel like you're doing your job.

I think the first step to stopping forced prostitution is un-fucking our heads when it comes to the toxic mire that is our conventions around sex and sexuality. If we didn't demonize wanting sex, we might be able to talk about how you seek it without doing damage to those you are seeking it from. If we'd  stop demonizing women for every aspect of sexuality that touches them, we might not be so quick to dismiss their humanity the second they are in some way sexual. We might stop seeing them as broken when they've lost their virginity, or been raped, or gone through the hell of sex trafficking.

Because even when you're out you're never out. The girls I worked with, you never would have guessed they were trafficked. They were funny, obsessed with fashion and singing and music, they were resilient and should have had a future. But I was teaching them English because they had no future in their country. No one would marry them after what they'd been through. It's not just getting them out, it's treating them like valuable human beings once they're out. It happens in America, too. We throw them at foster care or juvie as if they're the one's who did something wrong. We don't bother giving them justice, we don't think they're entitled to any money that was seized by the police. We don't even give them therapy in the States, FFS. And then we're surprised they end up right back in crime and drugs, because in America you pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

Police officers don't need to be bribed to ignore people the entirety of society has decided is worthless.",,/r/europe/comments/95j8ps/i_was_kidnapped_in_london_and_trafficked_for_sex/e3ttc7s/,Behemothwasagoodshot,1533740576

4390,"&gt; There is considerable debate concerning the legal effect of the protocol. One view, shared by Jan Jirásek,[17] is that the protocol is an opt-out that excludes the application of the Charter to Poland and the United Kingdom. Another, shared by Ingolf Pernice, is that the protocol is only an interpretative protocol which will either have limited or no legal consequence.[18] Craig and de Burcá argue that the protocol is merely declaratory. It says that the ""Charter does not extend the ability"" of the ECJ or other court to overturn UK or Polish law, but the ECJ already had the power to do this in any case. Accordingly, the Protocol is ""unlikely that it will have any significant effect in practice"".[19]

&gt; In NS v Home Secretary, the European Court of Justice ruled that Article 1(1) of Protocol ""explains Article 51 of the Charter with regard to the scope thereof and does not intend to exempt the Republic of Poland or the United Kingdom from the obligation to comply with the provisions of the Charter or to prevent a court of one of those Member States from ensuring compliance with those provisions"".[20]

4597,"My 2 cents.... no one apart from Albanians know how to speak or spell Albanian. I can only comment for Slovenia but Siptar was or is not being used recently or since the Kosovo war, not in a derogatory way at least,... my grandparents said it's the main term which was used for Albanians as it's the way they call themselves. Saying someone is Albanian meant to them, they had a Albanian passport which in our insane lands is different. English isn't my native language obviously so let me explain further... Any Bosnian or Serb or Croat living in Slovenia and even having a passport will unfortunately always be a  Bosnian, Serb or Croat (I fall under that group  of non Slovenes as well ). Derogatory Slovenians would call all from those 3 republics Cefur.  Now if you called them Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, that would not be meant in a bad way. Macedonians and Albanians were never part of that actually (dont know why, maybe someone else has the reasons/history).  Now maybe because Slovenes are hillbillies but saying someone was Siptar meant either Kosovar or Albanian, but derogaroty term still used today is Sipac. We honestly believed and I thought so too, that Siptar is a normal term... After meeting and befriending several Kosovars it was explained like this:

African americans can call themselves whatever then want, even nigger, and that's ok. But no white person should ever do it as it means something else. That's how Siptar works... Albanians can use it, but they will feel offended if an outsider uses it as well. 

What i'm trying to say is that )i believe) 90% of balkan hillbillies honestly  don't know Siptar is bad - and cant tell the damn difference in pronunciation or spelling, and think that they're doing the right thing. 

For anyone  that may say - your grand parents were racist... there's a difference between saying i've met a really nice Jewish person today, and \[insert curse work\] Jewish!

How so? because you say it? I see no evidence in your post about it.

&gt; You take the local optimum by trying to optimise the current car. This is at the cost of all other cars.

No, it's not. The algorithm doesn't optimize for one car, it simply splits the traffic load into equal chunks. It's an optimization for all cars.

&gt; Your problem is likely an NP problem.

No it's not. It's a very simple addition/counting algorithm: you have a set of N routes, you have M cars, you assign M cars to N routes.

Cambridge dictionary:
&gt; public speech that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or group based on something such as race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation (= the fact of being gay, etc.):

&gt;Forty-one percent of the sex buyers had themselves used a woman in prostitution who was controlled by a pimp.

Study : Melissa Farley, Emily Schuckman, Jacqueline M. Golding, Kristen Houser, Laura Jarrett, Peter Qualliotine, Michele Decker (2011),  *Comparing Sex Buyers with Men Who Don't Buy Sex: ""You can have a good time with the servitude"" vs. ""You're supporting a system of degradation"",* Paper presented at Psychologists for Social Responsibility Annual Meeting July 15, 2011, Boston, MA. San Francisco: Prostitution Research &amp; Education, **page 22**

&gt;Two thirds of both the sex buyers (66%) and the non-sex buyers (66)% observed that a majority of women are lured, tricked or trafficked into prostitution.

Same study, **page 23**

&gt;Fifty per cent of interviewees said that they had used a woman in prostitution who they knew was under the control of a pimp.  
&gt;  
&gt;Forty-eight per cent of 103 London men said they believed that most women in prostitution are victims of pimps, reflecting a reality that converges with what is known from observation and research studies (Boyer, 2008; DiPaolo, 1999; Giobbe, 1993; Herman, 2003; Ling et al., 2007; Raphael and Shapiro, 2002; Silbert and Pines, 1982; Vanwesenbeeck et al, 1995; West et al., 2000).

Study : Melissa Farley, Julie Bindel and Jacqueline M. Golding, December 2009, *Men who buy sex, Who they buy and what they know*, Eaves, London Prostitution Research &amp; Education, San Francisco, **page 15**

Keeping in mind that here, it's safe to assume in my opinion that men would be reluctant to admit they knew that the woman they bought sex from was coerced into it.

If your logic is that, currently, the most attractive gay guy is an older scruffier man, then everyone is going to want him, even the younger gays. So there will be some older guys with younger guys. Thus the image that the older guy went after the younger guy. Also I’ve meet a number of gay men who look a lot younger than they are, with all the shaving, plucking and make up, they were all in Essex though. 

However I think the real problem with people is that they don’t understand what make a pedophile want to do what they do. I certainly don’t understand it. I mean if we could say that it was a mental illness or a chemical imbalance or a something. So people go searching fo something to make it make sense. Sadly these narrow minded people also feel the same way about gay men. “How could a guy possible love another guy”. So they conflate these two, to them, unimaginable ideas together and come up with a very misguided and harmful idea.

Of course, there's a difference between forcing vaccinations and what is in essence having highly recommended and freely available vaccinations (for example).

""Populist"" typically refers to ""the People is Right"" attitudes combined with antielitism. I'd say Liga Nord, especially the old school members, are more nationalist, but in Europe the anti-EU stance can be considered a form of populism.

4761,"Your opinion is more valid than mine so don't be so humble. When sending my kids to school here there were a number of choices for second level.

All 3 kids went on to 3rd level and 1 is going back to change their area of study and a 2nd is considering it. I am not saying that type of choice is available throughout Ireland as i know it isn't. 

Back to the point though, in Ireland we tend to follow a lot of what the UK does. I would be very supportive of us looking further afield and seeing what is the most successful for society not only in teaching methods but also in the goals and orientation of the school programs.

4888,"Let's go through your list:

Jainism is a small religion, even compared to the others on your list. They are an outlier, sure.

Christian terrorism exists in past decades and is widespread. US, Ireland, Indonesia, Australia, China, multiple African states (Uganda for example). How is that not as global as islamic terrorism?

Judaism is also a relatively small religion in comparison. Yet how does the Palestinian situation not count as state sanctioned terrorism?

Buddhism is relatively peaceful, yes.  However, there's been buddhist terror attacks all across Asia as long as history goes back - even in recent decades. Japan's sarine gas attacks are a particularly famous example. And that Myanmar genocide thing going on.

Hinduism is a bit harder to define because it's so concentrated on India. The rape epidemic is part of it. Also hindu nationalism has been very much on the rise and with each Pakistani overreach, there's usually an Indian one to go with it.

Islam might be an outlier but not as big as you think. It's not like we have a suitable amount of big religions to compare (insert n&gt;30 meme).

4918,"It was East Germany as the representative of entire Germany.  The un-recognition was mutual. West Germany recognized Czechoslovakia after the Soviet invasion during its Ost Politic. The issues were numerous, ranging from Munich agreement, to 1945 borders vs 1938 vs 1939 Protectorate legacy, and the question of Germans expelled from Czechoslovakia after the war. West Germany for a while refused to recognize all countries that were under Soviet control. In the case of war between NATO and Warsaw Pact, West Germans POWs would be handed over to East German authorities.

The lack of recognition between Czechoslovakia and West Germany in 1945-1970 severally crippled the Czechoslovak economy. For example, one point Czechoslovak airlines were forbidden to fly over West German airspace and could not purchase fuel there. The flights had to be diverted via East Germany-Denmark to get to Canada and Cuba. Train connections were limited to two border crossing and so on. In 1970, there recognition forced the Czechoslovak government to drop demands for a war reparations (something similar happened to Poland), while West Germans will not seek damages from Czechoslovakia for the expulsion of Sudeten Germans. It was a zero sum game.  Because the Soviets were stationed in Czechoslovakia after 1968 (there were no Soviet troops in the country between 1945-1968), they controlled much of the foreign policy, and Brezhnev wanted to normalize and harmonized foreign policy among is vassals without the burden of the past.

4925,"&gt;But why?  
&gt;  
&gt;IIRC scientists have speculated that the reason homosexuality is found in humans and other species is as a measure to prevent overpopulation of a particular family (poorly worded but bear with me)

&gt;The hypothesis goes that the more sons a woman has the higher the chance of the sons being gay, the reason being that having an extra pair of hand to help is useful, but one doesn't want to many people of the same bloodline diminishing the gene pool...  
&gt;  
&gt;Regardless of that (as for the life of me i can't remember what that hypothesis was called)

Definitely an interresting Idea but for something like that there needs to be a study first.

[ncbi.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/9923159/) 
Studies done using obituaries and pre 1994 sex surveys suggested that the median age of death for homosexuals is less than 50. Two random sexual surveys one in the US and one in Britain yielded consistent results that median age of death of homosexuals is less than 50 years.  The median age of anyone ever married in Denmark, Norway, Sweden was 50 while the median age of those ever homosexually partnered was 40 years. The married people were 5 times more apt to be old and 4 times less likely to be widowed young. Drug abusers who use injections and homosexuals taking HIV tests in Colorado had almost identical age distributions.

Worth noting that homosexuality is found in many, *many* animals, and that it has been argued that, for social animals, having homosexual family members is genetically favorable. Even if homosexual people typically do not reproduce, they do share genetic information with their siblings, whom they usually help survive and care for their young.

4967,"First, this is over a 12 year period which would make the figures smaller if you do yearly and then compare to GDP. Then you have to consider spending per capita and consider that these economies are in general much richer than Poland. Lastly, in the end, this money spent fighting terrorism goes to EU law enforcement officers who get a job and pay from this, which cycles back to the EU economy. While, terrorism is a huge problem, it's actually not as big a problem *monetarily* as the 12 year figure makes it out to be.

On the topic of Polish immigration policy, as far as immigrants go the only relevant policy is the same as any other Eastern European country: they are shitholes. There's richer countries in the Middle East and at least you would have a similar culture, so why would they go to Poland?

So if the immigration policy you have come up with in Poland is being a shitty and poor country, then that's not really a viable solution. It would be analogous to solving rape crime by forcing women to smear shit on their face. No thanks, Poland.

1. While very young children cannot become pregnant, older children can. There are, unfortunately, multiple pregnancies (and births) cited for children who were 8, 9, 10 years old. There have also been reports of even younger children being pregnant, with the youngest being a girl in Peru who gave birth when she was 5 years old. While atypical, it does not detract from the fact that it happened.
2. Heterosexual people are attracted to people who are ""not eligible for reproduction"" all the time.

The only issue was the West Germany as it did not recognize Czechoslovakia until 1970, so the visa regime was ambiguous. However, travel to France, Austria, Italy, Sweden, Yugoslavia, Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands was possible under Novotny and Dubcek without much restriction. This is the reason why 200,000 deflected in a matter of 2 years during the Prague Spring and subsequent occupation of the country.

5089,"[https://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/arthritis-lyme-disease](https://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/arthritis-lyme-disease)

&gt;What is Lyme disease?  
&gt;  
&gt;Lyme disease is caused by bacteria, *Borrelia burgdorferi* that  are transmitted to humans through a bite from an infected black-legged  or deer tick. Symptoms can occur anywhere from 3 to 30 days after the  bite and can be wide-ranging, depending on the stage of the infection.  In some cases, symptoms can appear months after the bite.  
&gt;  
&gt;The chances you might get Lyme disease from a tick bite  depend on the kind of tick, where you were when the bite occurred, and  how long the tick was attached to you, the CDC says. Black-legged [ticks](https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/ticks-treatment) must be attached to you for 36 to 48 hours to transmit Lyme disease. If you remove the tick or [ticks](https://pets.webmd.com/ss/slideshow-flea-and-tick-overview) within 48 hours, you aren’t likely to get infected, says Cleveland Clinic infectious disease specialist Alan Taege, MD.  
&gt;  
&gt;What are the symptoms of Lyme disease?  
&gt;  
&gt;Early signs and symptoms include [fever](https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/fevers-causes-symptoms-treatments), chills, [headache](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/default.htm), [fatigue](https://www.webmd.com/women/guide/why-so-tired-10-causes-fatigue), muscle and [joint pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/guide/joint-pain), and [swollen lymph nodes](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/rm-knowledge-about-lymph-nodes-quiz) \-- all common in [the flu](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/default.htm). In up to 80% of Lyme infections, a [rash](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/guide/common-rashes) is one of the first symptoms, Aucott says.  
&gt;  
&gt;Without treatment, symptoms can progress. They might include:  
&gt;  
&gt;Severe [headache](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/ss/slideshow-migraine-overview) or neck stiffness  
&gt;  
&gt;Rashes on other areas of the body  
&gt;  
&gt;[Arthritis](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/default.htm) with severe joint pain and swelling, particularly in the knees  
&gt;  
&gt;Loss of muscle tone or “drooping” on one or both sides of the face.  
&gt;  
&gt;[Heart palpitation](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/guide/what-causes-heart-palpitations) or an [irregular heartbeat](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/atrial-fibrillation/ss/slideshow-heart-palpitations-causes)  
&gt;  
&gt;Inflammation of the [brain](https://www.webmd.com/brain/picture-of-the-brain) and spinal cord  
&gt;  
&gt;Shooting pains, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet

In the case of the person who previously owned my home, she was basically confined to bed at almost all times.  She cannot not work, cannot not have much of a social life since she was always tired, and her life is full of pain, especially from movement.  Most people aren't that bad thankfully.

All they need to do is see the other group as a threat to their image and ""dream"" for the country, nationalist or not. Plenty of countries who were very nationalist had civil wars. All you need is one group to think the other is a enough of a threat to your country for them to take action. As for reverence of the Army, Armies typical split during a civil war. Mix this with Kurdish separatism, I think it can happen 

I don't see it happening right now, but if the situation gets out of hand I think it is more than possible.

5212,"You have put it in context of the [Winter of Discontent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_of_Discontent). The British economy was crippled by an endless series of strikes, sympathetic strikes, high unemployment, and high inflation. The Labour party had built itself on support for the trade unions and was elected to deal with these problems. But even the pro-union Labour couldn't come to terms with the unions, or worse they could come to terms with the union leadership but the membership wouldn't go along. Case after case of brinkmanship negotiations to get people back to work and get the economy going again really took a toll and pissed people off. It got so bad that the government asked the IMF for a loan (a huge humiliation for a great power) and seriously considered activating the army to keep essential services running. The attitude was that if pro-union Labour couldn't come to terms then no one would. So a pissed off electorate voted for Thatcher, not to seek compromise, but to break the unions hold over the country.

So it wasn't so much that they thought they could yank the jobs away without consequences. They knew there would be consequences but the situation had soured to the point that they were willing to crush those industries to keep the rest of the country going.

“Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”

5342,"&gt; No. The need is that USB is meant to be universal. 

Because it has universal in its name? It's named that way because its aim was to replace PS2 for your mouse, the parallel port of your printer, the serial port interface you use to flash firmware on your TV and the Midi port you used to record from your keyboard. 

It replaced different type of connectors with a single one. That's why it's called universal. Not because you can turn the cable around. 

&gt; Well, I think you would lose that bet. 

Want to exchange addresses and we set up a 1000€ bet? The four high speed lanes will eventually no longer meet bandwidth needs. 

&gt; It seems you don't quite have a grasp what USB C is

I've written my own USB stack for an embedded device in the past. I know plenty about USB. 

USB-C is an evolutionary step in the existing lineup, and unlike previous connectors it is now on both host and device side. I have a 10 year old harddrive adapter from China that uses USB-A connectors on both sides. You would probably call it truly universal. 

&gt;  It seems you don't quite have a grasp what USB C is – its not a specific replacement for Micro USB, it replaces USB A as well. 

Because they found a way to make sure that two host devices connected together (like I could have done with my China cable) don't fry each other.    
Which is really great because you no longer need special cables for device-to-device connections. But it's nothing revolutionary from a technological viewpoint. There's plenty of connectors that support that since decades. As one can see today, not having that feature could not stop USB from getting widely adapted. 

&gt; USB C also replaces DisplayPort, VGA and HDMI as video connectors. USB C covers a far bigger range of usages than the older USB standards.

After everyone and their mother abused the USB connection for example for outputting analog audio, they made such thigns officially supported. Great step, no question. 

But eventually someone comes up with something that needs higher bandwidth than is physically possible via the 4 lanes of USB-C. You might be able to stretch the bounds a bit by making the cables active and short (Thunderbolt over USB-C supports 40GBit/s, but the cables must not be longer than 0.5m). But eventually you'll hit a hard wall again. 

And that's when the new 8 lane connector (or maybe something with optics) will shine. DisplayPort and ThunderBolt will happily switch connectors again. 

&gt; I would guess that USB C is likely the last USB standard. The next step to move beyond USB C will probably be wireless.

For smartphones that will happen within the next couple years. (Apple will be the first and they'll get criticized heavily). My external SSD won't go wireless anytime soon. ",Germany,/r/europe/comments/95bb2e/eu_may_force_iphone_to_switch_from_lightning_to/e3s2hly/,fluchtpunkt,1533668685
5343,"Our dispute is a wee bit bigger, though. 

And has dragged on too long for any side to simply give in.

Croatia can't ratify the arbitration because it's like going back to a cheating husband. We want to sit at the table and agree to exactly the same things that arbitration decided, but bilaterally.

Slovenia can't give up on arbitration because it would admit cheating. 

Since the arbitration decided on a compromise, that is, both sides win some, lose some, as it usually goes with compromises both sides think they lost. And that is what the opposition and media of each countr will say and why no government wants to back down and ratify it. 

Basically, to settle the dispute one government needs to admit mistake and defeat in front of the voters and definitely lose elections. I don't see that happening. Something needs to happen to change the stakes and allow the government which backs down to save face.

&gt;Apparently you value it around a thousand euros [...]

What phone are you comparing the iPhone X to that has a similar performance, software support and services but costs zero euros?

The profit margin on the iPhone X is the same as it is on the Samsung flagships. And yet, Samsung doesn't include &gt;5 years of software updates and an extensive services catalogue.

&gt;Spend a million euros to buy Apple slippers if it makes you feel great.

Valuing my privacy by buying from a company that actually doesn't vacuum my private data means I want to buy slipper from them? Are you even listening to yourself?

&gt;Let's not kid ourselves, connectors change every now and then. The USB-C connector or something similar would still have existed without the lightning cable.

Citation needed.

The Lightning connector was released 10 months before the USB-C connector. One would assume Apple, as they so often do, inspired innovation-copying among others. A proposal to force everyone to adopt one standard will only stifle innovation. No more evolution of technology, where the best solution wins grounds.

&gt;If Apple goes bankrupt tomorrow the world won't end and the USB port will be replaced in a few years.

Citation needed.

Do you know how old the previous USB-port is? 18 years. And that's how slow USB develops *without* a law forcing everyone to adopt one standard. Now imagine how slow USB will develop when a law is telling everyone they can't switch to the new standard, therefore removing incentives to hasten development and adoption of superior but more expensive alternatives.",Swedish Empire,/r/europe/comments/95bb2e/eu_may_force_iphone_to_switch_from_lightning_to/e3s2ofc/,CarlXVIGustav,1533668837

If apple would have put the resources it put into lightning, into an common alternative, that alternative would have been just as good / better right?  
Thus then there would be no need to lightning.  

&gt; Just because a company can do something doesn't mean they will do that.  

But they are still incentivized to improve, as they want to sell new phone with more features, if these features are improved / require a better cable then they will ofc try and make the common cable better.

5377,"&gt;The soldiers were not professional and had to go back their duties (well maybe Sparta was different), hence protracted wars were rare

Protracted fielding of armies was rare, not so wars themselves.

&gt; Most battles were more or less pitched, however while hoplite clashes were violent, battles were short and the loss of life surprisingly low - most often around 10% on the losing side and often less.

This is more due to the fact that the Greeks did not have efficient cavalry which meant they couldn't run down retreating soldiers, anyone who read Greek primary sources can tell you how fond Greeks were of killing the other side. When Greek forces fought in situations they couldn't or for some reason wouldn't run away there were massive casualties.

&gt; In dark ages the motives for war were somewhat different and in quite a number of cases losing side lost 100% of their forces

Mainly due to better cavalry and sieges if this is even true, I'd like to see some support for this as it seems highly unlikely.

&gt; Even the most high ranking men were given no quarter, as is clear from very high number of kings who ended up killed on the field

Just flat out wrong, most kings were killed during the battles, not after or while surrendering, a king could be pretty sure of being held for ransom if captured and not executed. Greeks were somewhat more happy to take common prisoners, I guess, but mainly as slaves which was very likely to result in eventual death.

Here's an example of Greek treatment of defeated enemies:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian\_Expedition#Final\_Syracusan\_victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Expedition#Final_Syracusan_victory)

&gt; Greeks had some rules of war while dark age warriors had none.

I don't even know what you're talking about. The Chivalric code contains rules of war (while technically exactly after the dark ages one presumes the dark ages had a precursor), I'm not aware the Greeks had any concept of rules of war in such a relatively organized manner (though I assume they had accepted and unaccepted behaviors).

&gt; However, if we look at some ancient battles (I have in mind Cannae) it's practically 100% too with very high number of casualties that no dark ages battle can come even close.

The moment Apple puts a USB-C to Lightning cable in the box you can do that too. They'll probably start doing that this year, their laptops are USB-C only already. 

&gt; Makers of iPhone chargers have to pay a licensing fee to Apple for each charger, that stifles innovation and limits consumer choice.

No one makes chargers with hard connected cables anymore. You buy a USB-A charger like everyone else. 

So the manufacturers makes a highly innovative cable. And as I've said the price difference between a Lightning cable and a USB-C cable from AmazonBasics is 2.50€. It costs 7.50€, the USB-C is 5.00€.

Sharia in itself is not a system of laws, but a collection of various normatives on religious customary practice determined by its scholars. It evolved out of a need to unify the tribal customs of Arabia and grew to serve as a ground law across various Muslim lands in Medieval times. The inertia to return to this classical sharia came from the rise of the movement of political Islam in the 1980s, driven mainly by fundamentalists. But there are Muslims who outright reject sharia, and there are secular traditions as well. Sharia law is as religiously binding as Biblical law.

5442,"&gt; People were asked to Leave or Remain. Leave won, so we're leaving. The concept is immaterial.

Yeah but there is 1 way of remaining since everything stays the same and literally dozens of ways in which one can leave the EU. Hell, the UK could literally just join the EEA and retain an almost identical membership except they would no longer be technically part of the EU and no longer have a vote in the relevant governing bodies. That however would probably piss of most leave voters since they imagine something entirely different. 

You cannot claim to represent the will of the people when the said will of the people branches out into a dozen different ways. For example only very few pro brexiters would be content with a no deal brexit. Hence, if the government now carries such a brexit (and the odds have risen a lot by now) you not only fail to represent the will of the 48% remainers but also of a majority of the 52% leavers. 

&gt; If we leave with no deal then so be it, as long as we leave.

5516,"While in general it's not the case, in Ireland there are times you should not drink the tap water. The worst was contaminated water in Galway for a time, but I understand that has now been fixed. A major issue is water in Ireland is seen as a free resource despite the fact it costs quite a lot to purify and distribute. 

The government tried to bring in water charges a few years ago. The campaign was not well handled, they set up a private company, Irish water, to do it, they said it was not a second tax it was just a change, but of course it was a second tax and they should have been honest, but regardless it was an utter disaster.

After a huge public backlash where people mobilised like never before, Irish water led in no small part to the collapse of the government and the scheme was recently abandoned after millions of investment. It was somewhat embarrassing that people were so animated about this relatively small issue but were totally fine with skyrocketing house and rent prices, government corruption, austerity and axing of services.

Personally I believe those who use more water should pay more for it. Even if it rains a lot in Ireland, it's still a limited and costly resource.

5517,"&gt; Free movement of the people is one of the fundamental ideas of the EU and it's a problem the UK has with the EU. 

When did we agree on that? When the UK joined it wasn't a thing. It was made a thing by politicians since that time when people voted to join the club. Do you not see why that's a problem? Personally, I like free movement, I even use it myself, but I can totally understand why many Europeans don't feel like they chose it. You are telling me that it's fundamental, yet we never voted, and it wasn't fundamental when we joined, so who decided it was fundamental and when did it become so? 

&gt;If you want to be part of the Union and enjoy the benefits then you have to accept the obligations as well.

Obligations that have been tacked on through the consensus of 28 national governments compromising without once giving people a chance to decide or even bothering to get the majority on board, or test this democratically. 

&gt;The UK can seemingly not accept that they'll have to give up certain things in order to receive others considering they still haven't come to terms with the fact that any EU citizen will be able to move to the UK should they choose to stay or choose to get a deal like Switzerland or Norway.

Reciprocation, great, but it's clearly a shit deal from the UK's perspective. It's not like British citizens are benefiting from their new rights on the whole. But letting millions of people from much poorer countries enjoy our very red-tape free job market certainly benefits other countries with terrible unemployment levels. 

&gt;And that dream vision I supposedly have is very real. I've lived and worked in various EU countries, have crossed three borders without any checks last weekend, enjoy not having to pay for roaming, have enjoyed being able to go to other EU country's embassies in countries where mine didn't have one. It's wonderful.

Great, I live in continental Europe and do the same all the time. I voted to remain. But if you can't see why all this shit you're claiming is ""integral"" was never decided by the actual people of the Union and has been slowly thrust upon EU citizens with no democratic process then you're a fool. 

Honestly, I think long term the EU is fucked. It's not a robust system that relies on the will of its populace, it just goes around it.

5569,"&gt;War between the city states was constant

Not as devastating though. The soldiers were not professional and had to go back their duties (well maybe Sparta was different),  hence protracted wars were rare. Segies were rare for the same reason. Most battles were more or less pitched, however while hoplite clashes were violent, battles were  short and the loss of life surprisingly low - most often around  10% on the losing side and often less. 

In dark ages the motives for war were somewhat different and in quite a number of cases losing side lost 100% of their forces. Even the most high ranking men were given no quarter, as is clear from very high number of kings who ended up killed on the field. Greeks had some rules of war while dark age warriors had none. However, if we look at some ancient battles (I have in mind Cannae) it's practically 100% too with very high number of casualties that no dark ages battle can come even close.

After popularisation of linen cloth instead of wool clothing, people would instead wash their clothing regularly and keep them clean and neat, presenting themselves as groomed this way. However they would take baths rarely, once or twice a year perhaps and only clean themselves with a damp linen cloth to get rid of sweat and grime. Mainly hands and face was washed with cold water on a regular basis.

In 18th century such practises were abandoned as miasma theory itself was abandoned, and bathing and public baths became common once more. So it's not true that medieval people in Europe didn't take baths, however it's true that early modern europeans abadoned practise of bathing as water was seen as something that faciliates disease for various reasons.

5620,"The policy was not specifically deliberate starvation; the policy, as was well documented at the time and which is not at all disputed, was ""meh, whatever"". 

Given the state of play in Ireland at the time, ""meh, whatever"" was tantamount to cheering on the blight and simply waiting around to sweep up the bodies. Gray himself says as much, and makes note of the prohibitive cost of your much-lauded food imports:  


  


&gt; Relief was (as before) to be
funded from locally-set and levied rates on landed property (equally divided in the
first instance between owner and occupier), making, in the popular political adage of
the time, ‘Irish property pay for Irish poverty’. While some small public or quasipublic
charitable funds were available to transfer top-up resources from the centre to
the peripheral, famine-devastated, poor-law unions in the west (officially designated
as ‘distressed’), these were used to compel compliance in self-assessment by the local
boards, and were mostly exhausted by mid 1848. No further transfers were
forthcoming until the Irish ‘rate-in-aid’ was approved in spring 1849 and a small
government advance made in lieu of its revenues. The consequence, especially in the
winter of 1848-9, was extremely high crisis mortality in the west and south-west of
Ireland (at a time of relatively low market prices following a massive influx of
imported foodstuffs), and the collapse of many unions into bankruptcy and the
suspension of their uncooperative boards in preference to appointed vice-guardians.
Not surprisingly, many historians have considered the British government more fault
for mass mortality in this rather than the earlier famine phase (1846-7) of countrywide
failure of the subsistence potato crop, international food shortages and extremely
high prices. 

Your perspective remains very much ""the English (and here we really are talking about England and not the UK as a whole) did nothing wrong and we sent food to Ireland"" and you're steadfastly sticking to your guns in spite of the evidence, and the commonsense argument, that *that food did not reach the starving Irish poor*. This was a matter of both policy (reflected in the pricing) and of attitude, reflected not only in the sneering disdain of men like Trevelyan but also in the malthusian approach which was in vogue at the time. Furthermore, punishment for stealing food was frequently deportation. The English like to joke about Australia being a nation of Irish convicts, but most of those convictions were for not doing their duty to god, king and country by having the decency to die on cue.

A new survey suggests many young people in Sweden are skeptical about the traditional format of democratic governance, and think the country being ruled by experts rather than politicians would be a good idea.

The survey, carried out by analysis firm Kairos Future, was sent out to 6,000 Swedes. A majority of those aged 16-25 who responded said that ""letting experts and not the Riksdag and government decide what is best for the country"" is a very good, or quite good proposal.

IN DEPTH: Why Sweden's democracy isn't as robust as you may think

That 54 percent was comprised of a broad group from across Sweden and of different political backgrounds, reports Swedish newspaper ETC, who were first to write about the survey.

""I think young people have a feeling that politicians are incapable of solving the problems we face, whether it's the climate or migration. It's easy to think that politicians just sit in their sandbox and fight with each other, and that we therefore need experts to take over,"" Åsa Knaggård, who researches the relationship between science and politics at Lund University, told ETC.

""With the climate issue for example it's easy to think that it's urgent and experts should go in and curb the trend. But the problem then is, which experts get to decide?""

Some young people also favour a knowledge-based right to vote, according to the survey. A majority (51 percent) in the same 16-25 age group agreed that voting in a general election should not be a considered a right for those who ""don't know anything about politics"".

The Good Friday Agreement requires the exact same economic circumstances on both sides of the Irish border.


If one side is in the Customs Union and the other side is not, that means the economic circumstances are not exactly the same on both sides of the Irish border and thus the Good Friday Agreement is violated.


Add to that the fact that Irish houses are half in ROI and half in NI, how would that work. A Borderpost in the living room?


The only possible solution to that in case of a hard Irish border is to remove those people and demolish those buildings.


I do not want this of course but that is the only way to have a hard border.

The EU's purpose is to ensure the prosperity and safety of its members and thus the EU cannot accept a hard Irish border.

In terms of schedules these are deals whereby you can import stuff without tariffs.

Say New Zealand wants to export Lamb into the EU and it has a tariff of 10%. There's a schedule by which they can export 1000 Lambs with 0% tariff and every lamb after that carries the 10% tariff.

But some of those Lambs go to the UK and some go to the EU, so we're splitting the schedules so that the (let's say 2000) lambs that go to the UK are tariff free, then charged thereafter, and the 8000 lambs that go to the EU are tariff free then charged thereafter.

For instance imagine 40 picking Remain as their first choice, EEA as their second and no-deal as their third, 35% picking EEA as their first, no-deal as their second and remain as their third, and 25% taking no-deal as their first, EEA as their second and remain as their third.

It seems as remain has won because the leave side is split up, but they have not.

Calculating all first choices we get:

Remain: 40%
EEA: 35%
No-deal: 25%

Since no-deal lost, we use its people's second choice. We get :

Remain: 40%
EEA: 60%

Sure, it would be nice to have no additional costs at all. But to be honest €385 is quite a minor amount of money and most of the time it’s way less. If it were in the thousands I’d have a much less cavalier attitude about it, though.

I can understand how you don’t notice the payment if it is deducted from your salary, but you do pay more even if there are no extra costs afterwards. I’d still vastly prefer your system over that in the US. 

But it’s a cultural thing to that is hard to understand from my (our?) perspective.

To be fair, that's true for Christianity and Judaism, too. When was the last time you stoned a man who laid with another man?

And let's not forget what happened in the Middle East after WWI, the constant support of the West of the fundamentalist movements post WWII, and all the failed secular attempts which failed because of Western interventions (Iran, Nasser and the rest...). The reason why the Arab (and Persian) world (because we are talking mostly about Arab Muslims here) is in crisis can be attributed to large parts of -surprise, surprise- Britain, France, and the US of A.

Pakistan has its own political issues, Afghanistan, well check out how it was in the 60s, and North Africa, is well, North Africa. Not the most stable of places with its heavy burder of post colonial politics.
