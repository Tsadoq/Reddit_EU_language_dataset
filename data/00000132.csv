1: a terrorist Organisation may get control of them. We have lost more then 16 nuclear weapons with twice the destructive power of Hiroshima since the 60s, so if your looking for a reason to sleep badly tonight just think about that.
2: any involved party might feel compelled to use these in a standoff like situation. Both Russia and China have leaders that can't afford loosing face, if China gets further surpressed in their economic development or Russia gets pushed out of Crimea, chances of one of those nations going ""Give me what I want or ill nuke you"" are ever rising, since these people have a pretty good chance of dying if they loose they wont have to care much about that anyway.

&gt; 
&gt; 

US operates in 51 states, which high degree of independence from federal government. US system has always been set up with decentralization of powers to States, including the economical ones. Its not a good argument as US states differ massively when it comes to their economical landscape, point I'm making again.

&gt;Exactly, no control of individual monetary rules is a good reason to not have one central bank setting generic rules for every member country

The ""one"" central bank is composed of Board of directors, nominated by each member state. It doesn't impose its rules, it follows a consensus of economical heads of member states, despite the fact that politicians like to weasel out of their choices by blaming it on EU / Commission / ECB / take a pick.

&gt;Opinions as ever. He's by no means the only person to disagree with the Euro. Nobel laureate Milton Friedman wrote about the potential problems back in 1997

Friedman died before the recession, he didn't have opinions on how euro performed or didn't during it as he wasn't alive. Given Friedman stances during Thatcher and Reagan its also extremely unlikely that he would be in favor of transfer union as proposed by Varoufakis, for example, despite the fact that such would be solution as proposed in the Guardian article you linked.

Frieman ""cultural"" comments are also legacy these days, as even far-right of all switched to talking about European solutions (eg migrant crisis, but not just). European identity and language of Europan solutions is already, especially following the crisis, well established.

Chechens kill Chechens regularly in Europe &amp; even in Germany, preferrebly women who dishonor the family (by talking to a man they're not married with in public on the streets - I wish I was kidding).

It's easy, and not particulalrly far fetched, to consider Russia being a possible culprit behind this, but until you have sufficient evidence, it remains speculation. Our legal system was ***not*** built around ""It's Russia's fault until proven otherwise."" - surprising, I know!

So far it's *a* theory, but the investigatiosn are still ongoing &amp; so is the collection &amp; processing of evidence, until a sufficient amount has been collected.

**""BREAKING: German criminal authorities wait for evidence to be found in ongoing investigations before declaring culprit!""** should not be a news headline. But here we are.

This is nothing unusual from CNN: Why let the facts get in the way when you have an opportunity to bash Russia *and* also Germany. Can't let that one slip by unused, just because of some nasty facts.

How loosely you want to use the label ""far right"" is your own choice. For me I find it hard. I wouldn't put Vox in quite the same ""box"" as the previously mentioned but the one beside them. Vox finds friends and ideological brethren in parties like Afd (Germany), Sweden Democrats (Sweden) or PVV (Netherlands). In each of those respective countries you can also find a further right party, usually hanging out between 0.1% and 1% of the vote.

662,"European fighter industries are semi-cottage industries in comparison to American ones. Technologically, they lag in key areas (most prominently stealth capabilities and sensor fusion), but that's not the biggest thing holding them back. 

It's the rate of production that holds them back. European fighters are produced in tiny lots compared to American fighters, Chinese fighters, and many Russian fighters. This leads to production being stretched out over multiple years to keep the industries involved going, and results in high per-unit costs for the fighters that are built. 

Expensive, and slow to deliver. No wonder American aircraft are preferred (specifically, the F-16 and F-35, both of which have very large production orders and per-unit costs cheaper than comparable or inferior European aircraft). 

Europe needs to choose, for the good of Europe. Do you want an independent military industrial complex? *Buy* *more* *domestic* *stuff*. Expand your air forces, your navies, your armies, and source local. Develop large customer bases in your countries, to sustain your military industries, and then use export orders as an addition to that. Otherwise, European products will always be uncompetitive compared to cheaper American models, *much* cheaper (and politically neutral) Russian models, or even the new Chinese models coming online in the future. 

And it's a shame, because the Rafale is a capable, cutting-edge aircraft in many ways. The Gripen is an easy-to-maintain, reliable aircraft that betters the F-16 in many ways. Even the Eurofighter, flawed as it is, has some advantages. But expense, and slow deliveries, will always bedevil European exports until you start expanding your militaries - and that means hard choices about what you spend on.",,/r/europe/comments/dr201x/european_countries_buying_more_and_more_american/f6gnknh/,JeuneEcole,1572828179

Yes, that is the most stupid way of wasting money and resources a nation can do. If others can produce cheaper, then let them.

Eh, doesn't mean much, it was large, sure, but in terms of population, etc ? 

Not so much, and when you factor in actual control, even less. The feudalism that made it so big/governable was also a problem, because the different lords wished for their own thing. So, as long as it was about expanding, no problem, but ruling ? A bit harder, and the split shows that well.

Correct. NATO designated them to be a terrorist organisation.

Did you actually read the entire article you've linked? Because its point is precisely to explain, in details, what led France to become an actual absolute monarchy under Louis XIII and XIV. It's a well written article, by the way.

Absolutism has its roots in the middle ages, and obviously Fran√ßois 1er contributed to its emergence. But the actual foundations of what was to be called *absolute monarchy* in France were mostly born out of the struggle of the French wars of religion in the second half of the 16th century, and gradually refined in the 17th century as a mean to restore the order, unity and peace of the kingdom, by building obstacles between particular interests of feudal lords and parliaments on one hand, and the common good and stability of the entire realm on the other. 

French absolutism was essentially the culmination of the protracted centralization of power initiated in the 12th century, made possible by very specific events. The Thirty Years War in particular, by abolishing or restructuring previous paradigms regarding the nature of sovereign states and the prerogatives of their monarchs, contributed to the preeminence of the State as the central and exclusive actor both internally and externally. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;So the king decides what laws he wants to pass not the parliament.

And has been so since the coronation of Clovis I. The king has always been the ultimate source of law, both in practice and formally.

But just because it's not a purely parliamentary monarchy doesn't mean it's an absolute monarchy, and *vice versa*. There is a wide field between those two extremes.

Incidentally, under Fran√ßois 1er, parliaments (plural, because France didn't have a single parliament like England) still had the authority to reject royal edicts and refuse to enforce them if they were deemed a breach of the fundamental laws and customs of the kingdom of France. They only lost that preemptive authority in 1641, precisely because they had become an recurrent obstacle to royal legislation.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;So the king decides on the govt. 

And has been so, again, since the 6th century, and even during the heights of feudalism. It has nothing to do with France being an absolute monarchy or not. For over a thousand years, the French ""government"" was essentially the king and his personal council. But being the ultimate source of law doesn't mean he could do whatever he wanted. He was partially and diversely restrained.

Absolute monarchy is precisely about the king being almost entirely unrestrained legally and institutionally in his decisions. This didn't happen until the 17th century, and the reign of Louis XIII (but really, Richelieu) and Louis XIV. 

And just like modern dictatorships, it's such an extreme, unstable and fragile form of government, because in the absence of a fair and natural balance of power its efficiency and success are tied to the personality of the monarch rather than the institutional structures themselves, that it didn't survive the reigns of Louis XV and XVI, who were mediocre/average kings.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;So the king obtains the right to name archbishops, bishops, abots. 

The Concordat of Bologna re-acknowledged the right of the king of France to personally nominate bishops. Those nominations were nonetheless subject to confirmation by the Pope to be enforced. In the 16th century, French kings were *absolutely not* free to independently install whoever they wanted as bishops.

Even the Declaration of the Clergy of France of 1681 didn't gave the king complete freedom to independently manage the Church of France. It only happened with the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, in 1790, and it was short-lived.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;So he has total powers in 3 main areas. 

He has ***partial*** powers in 3 main areas. 

Fran√ßois 1er was absolutely not an absolute monarch. He merely contributed to the movement toward absolutism, and the French legal and political institutions under his reign were still largely rooted in the medieval and feudal legacy.

&amp;nbsp;

1095,"This really bothers me. In Sweden we have a nationalist anti-immigrant party that's rising strongly in the polls. Frighteningly so. It's on par with the historically largest socialist party in the country. But they've never held power, and in the municipalities where they do they haven't exactly been exemplary. A fair few seem to just take money and barely show up for anything but immigration related items ont he agenda. Others are just shit at their jobs (not that they're unique in that regard). I honestly wonder if they'd ever want to actually hold a government position, since then they'd suddenly have to compromise and take responsibility. As any party that doesn't rule with majority has to do in a democracy. And Sweden hasn't had a majority government since the 70's, disregarding the majority centre-right coalition from about a decade ago.

But voters seem oblivious, choosing to believe that quashing immigration (which has issues, mind you. I won't argue that it doesn't) will solve EVERYTHING. It'll make the welfare decline reverse, it'll make school result shoot through the roof, create employment beyond your wildest imagination and lower taxes. Wine will run from the tap and shit will cease to smell.

Ok I might have uh... exaggerated there for a bit. But holy hell the delusions some people harbor about democracy and economics. And even more frighteningly, the reverence which they harbor for their party. It's kind of normal to be able to talk shit about the party you support when they're being shitty.

Again, mountains and valleys play no role. Open google maps and take a look at Switzerland. The part where like 80% of the Swiss population lives is completely open to Germany as well as France, and there's also no physical borders between the different lingual regions. 

&gt; there was no serious attempts by any ethnic group to dominate or even enslave/destroy other ethnic groups

Because nobody here ever spoke about ""ethnic groups"". This whole bullshit talk about ethnicity only came up in the last two centuries, and was used by certain foreign powers and foreign political parties to create division. Unlike the population of Bohemia the Swiss population didn't fall for it (German, French as well as Italian nationalists also tried to influence the Swiss with their bullshit theories). 

And on a side note: Language doesn't define an ethnicity. Genetically a German speaking Swiss is closer to a French speak Swiss than to someone from for example Northern Germany.

If we just look at the building, we can see how similar it is in terms of material and the building style as Khrushchyovka.

Even up to the fall of Communism, many of these countries had housing issues due to booming populations and underperforming economic systems.

1194,"(1) In no way did I mean to suggest that the military were na√Øve. It's everything but. They knew about these things since the late 1970s, just as ExxonMobil (and others in the industry) did. Yet while they were secretly assessing the situation and looking for ways to address it, they didn't say a word to the public; even worse, they  labelled anyone talking about it a loony. 

So much as to what the military is all about. It's not security, and it most certainly isn't their mission to ""keep us safe"". Arguably, it's the exact opposite. 

(2) I'm quite familiar with the work of Schellnhuber *et al*. I don't disagree with their findings at all, but I do think the solutions they propose are misguided at best and illusory at worst. Or do you really think that humanity will manage to turn everything it held dear for the last few thousand years upside down and do a 180 within the span of two or three generations? That's hubris. 

Hubris that is compounded by people like you who lead your fellow humans to look for answers where there are none: Nation states. There is absolutely no way on earth that a ramshackle collection of nation states who occasionally work together on some or another puny project whilst being at each other's throats for the rest of the time are up to *that* challenge. 

What we should be doing instead is to ""go for the moon"". Literally! Let's get a moon base up and running. Let's learn how do to this. And afterwards, let's head to Mars and take it from there.

1206,"Actually ""Britannia"", the Roman province, referred only to Britain below Hadrian's wall, ie England and Wales. Ptolemy refers to ""Pretanic Isles"", and distinguishes ""Albion"" (Britain) from ""Iwerna"" Ireland, which is the imputed historical source for ""British Isles"". 

The term is basically not in use then from the withdrawal of the Romans from Britain in the 5th century until the reign of Elizabeth the first (ie over a millenium), when it's resurrected basically to lend legitimacy to her colonisation (""plantation"" in the lingo of the day) of Ireland, which by this point is de facto politically independent from the English crown everywhere outside Dublin. The term has been explicitly political for several centuries. 

Further, we could look at, say, the Iberian peninsula. Clearly as much of a natural geographic unit as Ireland and Britain, but we don't call it ""greater Spain"", despite the fact that the Roman province of Hispania *did* actually cover the entire peninsula. The reason for this is political: Portugal, unlike Ireland, was powerful enough to withstand subjugation by its two larger, merging neighbours (Castile and Aragon for Portugal, England and Scotland for Ireland).

Look at a pair of islands like Corsica and Sardinia: no collective ""neutral"" geographic term there, because there's been no political impetus for it. Look at the Caribbean: the island of Cuba is by far the largest, but we don't call all the others ""the Cuban islands"".

My point is that the name ""British Isles"" has never just been a matter of geographic convenience, and has always carried an implicit political assertion of dominance too.

He literally brought them back to Spain in chains which the Church forbade and condemed him for.


&gt;He speaks against the slavery of young girls and punished those who committed these acts with mutilation and death.


He literally says that for slave girls you need to provide a lot of money, lol.


&gt;Yet, they were complaining about the mutilation of there fellow colonists. The natives were also mutilated for various crimes but they didn't care about them, the tyranny they were talking about was his treatment of his fellow Spaniards.

He mutilated his own men because they stole corn and other foods, he mutilated the natives for le≈° than that.


&gt;Considering that future governors were the ones responsible for the elimination of the natives im going to say no. 42 years of governors after Columbus brought the native population down from 200,000 to 201 (of course around 90% of these people would have died from disease but that still leaves 20,000).

In 1517 decade after Colombus died, and majority of them died from epidemic diseases that didn't exist at times if Colombus arrival.


During his second voyage.

&gt;Wherever the marauding, diseased, and heavily armed Spanish forces went out on patrol, accompanied by ferocious armored dogs that had been trained to kill and disembowel, they preyed on the local communities - already plagued-enfeebled - forcing them to supply food and women and slaves, and whatever else the soldiers might desire. At virtually every previous landing on this trip Columbus's troops had gone ashore and killed indiscriminately, as though for sport, whatever animals and birds and natives they encountered, ""looting and destroying all they found,"" as the Admiral's son Fernando blithely put it . . . More than 50,000 natives were reported dead from these encounters by the time the Admiral had recovered from his sickness. And when at last his health and strength had been restored, Columbus's response to his men's unorganized depredations was to organize them. In March of 1495 he massed together several hundred armored troops, cavalry, and a score or more of trained attack dogs. They set forth across the countryside, tearing into assembled masses of sick and unarmed native people, slaughtering them by the thousands"" (p. 70).

absolutely not.

Many countries have a part of taxes paid from gross wage (employee part) and a part paid on top of gross wage (employer part), for each employee. Gross wage is just a number, somewhere in between. What really matters is total wage (gross wage + employer taxes), thats the cost for employer, and net wage (gross wage - employee taxes), what each worker takes home. And the rest are obviously taxes (employers taxes + employee taxes). 

What really matters, when it comes to work taxes, is total taxes, taxes out of total wage. [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rates_in_Europe) is such a list.

In the wiki page you also have [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Payroll_and_income_tax_by_country.png) image. You're ignoring the light blue part when you do gross wage.

Exactly, so why did you think France would give two shits about this country's name change? The agreement was all about preventing the *Greeks* from saying no to the accession talks, it didn't do shit for the other countries who might have objections to newcomers in the EU. 

&gt; Its not like what he did to Albania was any better, given the fact that Council two years back specifically outlines the requirements for approving accession, Albania met them and then the same happened.

I cannot find anywhere France's role in this, or an official position on France's part about Albania's accession talks. What I can find predates Macron's arrival to the French presidency and I don't see why Macron should be bound by the previous presidents' non-bindind wishes.

He married his sweetheart with whom he has a grown up daughter just last year, after more than two decades being with his paramour.

1495,"No you don't have to register. Once you share the same home you have certain protections under the law as a *Sambo*-relationship, which are similar to a marriage and a registered partnership. It is very common that people introduce each other as someone's *sambo* instead of husband and wife, or partner.

The big difference between a *sambo*-relationship and a marriage is when one *sambo* dies. Without a written testament the still living *sambo* inherits nothing.

*Sam*-prefix means that something is together, and *bo* means living. There are word plays for other types of living situations, most common is probably *s√§rbo* where the *s√§r*-prefix means that something is apart. So when two adults are in a relationship but choose to live by themselves, they call their relationship a *s√§rbo*-relationship.

1544,"[The Armistice of Villa Giusti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_of_Villa_Giusti).

After the decisive [Battle of Vittorio Veneto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vittorio_Veneto), Austro-Hungarian and Italian generals met in Padua to negotiate a truce.

The armistice was signed on the 3rd of November 1918, at 3:20 PM. This ended the hostilities on the [Alpine Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_campaign_\(World_War_I\)), a bloody trench warfare that saw more than 400,000 Austro-Hungarian and 561,000 Italian soldiers killed in action, plus more than 2,000,000 wounded. 

Every 4th of November (the day when the armistice took effect), Italy commemorates ""National Unity and Armed Forces"" with a national holiday. After signing the armistice, General Diaz, Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, sent an address to his troop, known as [Bollettino della Vittoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollettino_della_Vittoria#English):

*""The war against Austria-Hungary, which the Italian Army, inferior in number and equipment, began on 24 May 1915 under the leadership of His Majesty and supreme leader the King and conducted with unwavering faith and tenacious bravery without rest for 41 months, is won.*

*The gigantic battle, which opened on the 24th of last October and in which fifty-one Italian divisions, three British, two French, one Czechoslovak and a US regiment joined against seventy-three Austrian divisions, is over.*

*The Austro-Hungarian Army is vanquished: it suffered terrible losses in the dogged resistance of the early days, and during the pursuit it lost an enormous quantity of materials of every kind as well as almost all its stockpiles and supply depots. The Austro-Hungarian Army has so far left about 300,000 prisoners of war in our hands along with multiple entire officer corps and at least 5,000 pieces of artillery.*

*The remnants of what was one of the world's most powerful armies are returning in hopelessness and chaos up the valleys from which they had descended with boastful confidence.""*

I meant that the brexit people do just that.
Elections can be held again, snap election can be called, and it's all democratic, because the will of the people (shockingly) can change when presented with new information. 
A non-binding referendum that excluded a group of voters that is very vulnerar to the result cannot be repeated, because that'd be ""undemocratic"".
Why have elections every few years then? Or snap elections when the government isn't functional or can't be formed due to lack of majorities and coalitions?
Why have the first referendum at all? The UK voted to enter the EU back then, so surely repeating that referendum is undemocratic?
The point is that the Brexiteers don't give a fuck about democracy when they fear the results could go against their will.
Look at Bojo. He disbanded parliament to push through his agenda. He literally put democracy on hold to get his way. Very democratic.

Or to use another example: you tell someone a bunch a lies about how fantastic you are and pretend to be the best, nicest person out there, just so they'll have sex with you. They agree. Then, you show that you vastly over exaggerated everything about yourself, and told some blatant lies. They change their mind. So should you just go ahead and rape them?

There are growing concerns in Brussels that, under Orban‚Äôs leadership, Hungary is following a Russian model; indeed the European Parliament voted last year to trigger the EU‚Äôs most serious disciplinary procedure, asserting that Hungary‚Äôs government posed a ‚Äúsystematic threat‚Äù to democracy and the rule of law.

Yet, they're still in the EU, because, OH DEAR LORD, we can't lose another member state.

That will lead to WW3!!!!#$$@!!!

Unlike actually accepting this autocratic bullshit in our own EU...

&gt;Authoritarian anti-liberalism has grown across much of Eastern and Central Europe while liberalism has been tarnished in the West by the 2008-09 financial crash, Brexit, and the election of Donald Trump.

Dems are weak. Trump will probably win in 2020. But sometimes I wonder what'll happen if he doesn't. Or if he gets impeached. That *will* have an effect on all the mini-Trumps in Europe.

A man can dream.

A dream about Orban being kicked out of the EU cause he defies everything the EU stands for. On a daily basis.

1693,"British refers to any identity from Great Britain, the largest island of the British isles. It also includes the identity of Northern Irish Unionists who are descended from Scottish and English settlers in Northern Ireland from the 1600s. However, British is also the identity which is most chosen by people from Ethnic minorities because it seems more neutral and civic and less ethnic than ""English"". Modern British identity starts with the Union of 1707 and really takes off in the Napoleonic Wars, drawing on old Roman imagery like the Goddess Britannia who represents the isles with the trident and stuff. 

English refers to the people of England, and England alone. There is also a class divide in a way, because British identity is ""Winston Churchill, Empire, tea, the Queen, cheerio!"" and English is more ""football, beer, shakespeare's Henry V speech, hooliganism"" etc, at least in the public eye. English identity starts with the Anglo-Saxons coming to England and evolves when the Normans and subsequent French dynasties take over, and then when those French nobles start speaking English themselves. 

Of course there are things that unite English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish people in terms of culture and stuff (like Dr.Who or the 90s UK Rave scene) and these can be called ""British"". 

To people from other countries ""English"" and ""British"" are interchangeable, which Scottish Unionists (think Rangers fans) and Northern Irish Unionists tend to hate. And to be honest, some English people tend not to identify strongly as British and much moreso as English and don't like being called British because they don't believe in the Union (of England, Scotland, Wales and NI) or just don't identify as such because it isn't a very strong identity - it feels *too* neutral and polished, or maybe they don't like the imperial connotations.

In other words, its really really really complex. The UK has some very weird and hate-filled conflicts of identity within its borders. Its a bit like the Balkans of Northern Europe, except the genocidal conflicts were hundreds of years ago not in the 90s - although obviously the Troubles in Northern Ireland  only ended on paper in 1997 with the Good Friday Agreement.",I DEMAND A MERCIA FLAIR,/r/europe/comments/dqth93/national_identity_across_the_uk_2011/f6anze9/,MercianSupremacy,1572759733

1700,"&gt; Firstly read this, we find that there was a directive based on the convention, its not the conventionthat is being implimented. 

Ok I get it more. So you had the ability to refuse a convention. Because that's what article 23 of the convention of Vienna is saying. But your country didn't use it and there's a reason for that.  

&gt; Secondly reading this we find the article and the name of the convention.

Finally you give a proper answer. So there's indeed rules about that. But it doesn't forbid your country to have a flashing green light. You can see in Wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_Road_Signs_and_Signals) the different traffic light that have a meaning that can't be changed if you're part of the convention (if you want the original one instead of Wikipedia because you don't trut it, you can find it [here](http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/conventn/signalse.pdf). Green means go (if you can), red means you can't go. Seems fair enough. It doesn't say at all you can't have a flashing green.

1802,"All of the infrastructure for chattel slavery was already in place in Africa by the Arabs. The Arabs had been enslaving Africans for thousands of years (and they still do). Arab slave traders took them and put them on ships out of East and Central Africa to the Middle East and India where they‚Äôd be enslaved. The Europeans saw this and simply copied them using the existing infrastructure. 

The only difference is the Europeans (and Americans) eventually outlawed slavery and freed everyone (though there are still ramifications, clearly). 

The Arab nations didn‚Äôt outlaw slavery until like the 1970s, but they still take them in illegal ways. Who do you think is buying all the Africans in the slave markets TODAY in Libya and other poor African nations? It certainly isn‚Äôt the Europeans or Americans. We just don‚Äôt hear about it bc they aren‚Äôt considered ‚Äúthe free world‚Äù and all the atrocities that go on there are silenced and squashed. 

I am by no means excusing the Europeans for enslaving Africans in the Americas and the horrors that it caused that are felt to this day. It‚Äôs the notion that Europeans are *solely* to blame is what bugs me the most. They aren‚Äôt. The whole world has been raping and pillaging Africa at one point or another.

Likewise, Gypsies and other minorities always had higher birth rates than Serbs, as they live in more rural areas.

1861,"The claim that Columbus thought he was in India isn't accurate. Columbus wrote,  ""I have come to believe that this is a mighty continent which was hitherto unknown. I am greatly supported in this view by reason of this great river, and by this sea which is fresh."" He knew that he was somewhere new. No cosmographer was aware that in the Pacific Ocean, there was a continent between Europe and Asia, so it's really unfair to attack a mere sailor like Columbus without a scholarly background for not knowing before his first voyage that an entire continent was between Europe and Asia.

The Vikings sailed from Greenland to Vinland, which is only 1000 kilometers. But the distance from Spain to Cuba is 7000 kilometers, which makes Columbus' feats far more impressive than what the Vikings did. The only reason why the Vikings reached Newfoundland was because a storm took them there by accident. Erikson did know where he was and probably thought he was still somewhere in the Arctic or Europe. The Vikings had zero cultural impact on North and South America and they quickly left Vinland. 400 million people in the Americas speak Columbus' language and 500 million people in Latin America belong to Columbus' church, but no one in the Americas speaks Leif Erikson's language and Viking paganism is extinct

In Hispaniola, which Columbus founded, the first church in the Americas was built. The first Catholic mass was held. The first courthouse and first stone house was built. The first hospital, first sugar mill, first university in the Americas were built by the Spanish, and the first book written in the Americas was written by a Spaniard. Columbus was accompanied by 80+ Spaniards on his first voyage and 1200+ men on his second voyage, and was able to establish political and military supremacy in an island that contained 500,000 Indians - this is an amazing, brilliant military accomplishment exceeded only by Cortes' landing in Mexico and Pizarro's march in South America, as the Incas and Aztecs numbered in the millions and were far more developed and culturally advanced than the Tainos. Columbus' military accomplishments were more impressive than those of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar.

The accusation that Columbus committed genocide shows a misunderstanding of how genocide is defined and misrepresents the historical record during Columbus' time in the New World.  There were tribes in Hispaniola that welcomed and considered alliance with Columbus and the Spanish. Most famous was Guacanagari's tribe, who formed an alliance with Columbus during his 1st voyage and never stopped trying to get the Spanish to attack his enemy tribes like those led by Caonabo and Behechio. Many tribes saw the arrival of the Spanish as an opportunity to defend themselves against other, more threatening tribes. Three thousand Indians backed Bartolome Colombus against the Ciguayos and Guarionex.  While Columbus was away at sea or in Europe in 1493, Fort Navidad was attacked by the chieftain Caonabo, and 39 Spanish were slaughtered, and this was the primary reason why relations between Columbus and some of the tribes broke down. Columbus and his men exercised self-defense while fighting armed combatants, and ended up defeating the enemy tribes. The Spanish monarchs pursued and implemented policies by which Indians would be protected, introduced to Christianity, and incorporated into the Spanish kingdom with the same rights as Spaniards. Spanish laws in the 16th century were remarkably humane and compassionate towards Indians, and were completely opposite to genocide.",,/r/europe/comments/dqii4f/bruh/f69cycx/,ConsciousBook,1572740265

1930,"&gt; Switzerland is geographically separated from the rest of Europe by Alps

What? That's just plain wrong. More than 80% of the Swiss population live in the Swiss lowlands. Especially the [Swiss Plateau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Plateau) is very populated and it's easy accessible from Germany as well as from France (not to mention that Ticino is completely open to Italy). 

&gt; there is safety and wealth to share

Switzerland was one of the poorest European countries for most of its existence. 

&gt; there is geographical division between German, French and Italian parts

What do you mean by geographical division? For most of Switzerland there's no natural borders (like mountains or rivers) separating the different lingual groups from each other. There's even bilingual cities. 

And neither are there political borders, in fact there's several cantons with more than just one language.

&gt; All these cultures were strong themselves and a part of larger European Christian culture for centuries. 

And so was the Bohemian culture. In fact Behomia was much stronger and longer integrated in ""larger cultures"" than Switzerland. From the HRE to the Habsburg empire. 

Historically Switzerland's cohesion has a lot to do with local identity (and self determination). The average Swiss has first and foremost identified himself with his region and his canton, and not with his language or his confession (albeit the religious differences did play a certain role, leading to several internal wars in Switzerland; but a basic solution has already been found 100 years before the 30 years war, tho the resulting political division between traditional Catholic cantons and regions, who would be more conservative and against a central state, and the traditional Protestant cantons and regions, who were more liberal and in favor of a central state, would continue till mid 19th century; not to mention the struggle of the cantons that consistet of regions with different confessions). In fact the difference in language has never really been reason for a conflict, not even a single time in over 800 years. Especially the cantons have and still play a very important role in Switzerland. 

The Bohemians (and Moravians) should have put a lot emphasis on their common Bohemian idenitity and their shared values. But unfortunatelly people (both, Czech as well as German speaking people) started to focus on lingual differences and became prone to all that crap talk about ethnicity that came up in the last two centuries. 

I guess sometimes local patriotism can actually become a good thing, at least it stops people from hating and slaughtering their own neighbors (given that that patriotism is really centred around the actual location and not language or ""ethnicity""). All that shit about ethnicity and lingual identity has resulted in nothing but bloodshed in the last century. It caused so much terrible things after the Ottoman as well as the Habsburg Empire collapsed. Edit: Not to mention that it lead to the genocide of the Jewish people who were an integral part of most European societies for the longest of times.",Switzerland,/r/europe/comments/dqj6om/expelled_prague_german_waiting_for_their/f68xc1s/,thebiggreengun,1572732671

However, only one of the campaigns is still notorious for driving around a bus with an actual lie on it. Not a slight adjustment of the truth, not an unbalanced perspective, an actual lie. One side also kept claiming they could keep ""the good parts"" of being in the EU and pick and choose what they like, which was also never correct. One side kept claiming that they were going to make the EU bend to their will and propose great deals, and guess what, the EU actually said that right after the referendum: no way. Actually not possible at all. One side also claimed that there would be no economic issues whatsoever, when even back then it was clear (and now, everyone agrees) that a hard Brexit would plunge the UK economy into disaster. 

As for ""the choice was made"": no, it was not. First and foremost, one key group was explicitly exempt from participating: British citizens living in other EU countries. The group that would be most affected among all British citizens. Hardly very democratic to exclude the people whose lives you're going to turn inside out. The referendum was also non-binding. It was an opinion poll. Leave, of course, presented it very much differently (another lie, by the way). 

What's more important, though, is that the question ""leave or remain"" is silly and the issue is much, much too complicated to only have those two options. Many people like to present it as ""people said leave, that means hard Brexit"" when that's not what the people were asked. It wasn't ""remain or leave, come what will, barring no challenge, issues, hardship"". 

Curiously, the people who cry ""the referendum was held, respect democracy"" are also fundamentally against having a second democratic referendum. One that, for example, has three options: remain, leave with no deal, leave with whatever deal the UK and EU managed to agree upon. Of course, they say, ""you can't overturn a decision just like that!""

But the UK has had a change of leadership to someone unelected in 2016. And snap elections in 2017. And no Brexiteer cried ""but the people chose their parliament already! It's democracy!"" Because that's not how democracy works. 

And then there was another election in 2019.

Of course, they'll say that ""we haven't had a chance to let Brexit happen and see how it goes! 

And now there will be yet another  snap election. And arguably, the government has achieved absolutely nothing since the last election earlier this same year. 

So pick and choose what you think is democracy.

1976,"&gt;In poor health, Columbus returned to Hispaniola on 19 August, only to find that many of the Spanish settlers of the new colony were in rebellion against his rule, claiming that Columbus had misled them about the supposedly bountiful riches of the New World. A number of returning settlers and sailors lobbied against Columbus at the Spanish court, accusing him and his brothers of gross mismanagement. Columbus had some of his crew hanged for disobedience. **He had an economic interest in the enslavement of the Hispaniola natives and for that reason was not eager to baptize them, which attracted criticism from some churchmen**\*.\* An entry in his journal from September 1498 reads: ""From here one might send, in the name of the Holy Trinity, as many slaves as could be sold¬†...""

I'm not saying enslaving pagans is any better than enslaving people based on their ethnicity but even by 15th century standards the guy was a fucking dick. It's interesting to see how slavery shifted from religion based to race based slavery. And they overlap as well (eg. [slavery of the Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_indentured_servants), and I know people say the slavery of Irish is a myth... it definitely wasn't as bad as the slavery of black people but it sounds A LOT like slavery to me... and it doesn't soften the harshness and cruelty that black people suffered in the US which is an argument some white nationalists try to use...)",Finland,/r/europe/comments/dqii4f/bruh/f68yk5i/,incognitomus,1572733050

1981,"&gt; Nobody is saying that the work towards improvement of the situation ends in the migrant quota system. That's just part of it, in terms of actually giving countries like Greece, Italy etc the opportunity to do as much damage control as possible and not living them out to dry. 

Quota system was the main focus in 2015-2016 and it seems to be coming back again.

&gt;With relocation you are simply shouldering the issue while **at the same time** as a union hopefully working towards fixing the issue for good.

They couldnt get their main program to work, resolving this migration problem in a good way is so much more complicated, I have no trust that they are able to do it. Again, it seems their main focus is just to keep taking in migrants and redistribute them all over Europe.

&gt; But such things will take time and at it's current rate Greece can only hold but so many people. 

Time? Its been almost 5 years, what exactly has been done? What has improved? If they couldnt have done it in 5 years, what makes you think they will be able to do it in another 5 or !0 or 20?

&gt;Greece , Italy , Spain, Malta aren't ok with simply being Europe's refuge dump either tho. The rest of Europe ""really not being ok with the quota system"" isn't anything that concerns us.

Meetteri√§ or metteri√§ or metri√§ are all more natural to me (and which is most natural would likely vary by dialect), but those would then correspond to stems/nominative forms of meetteri, metteri, and metri respectively. So using just ""meter"" even as an alternative doesn't really work in Finnish IMO.

I'm assuming when it was loaned and/or eventually formalized into standard Finnish, they figured the Romance *metre* was closer to the original etymology and also easier to adapt to Finnish, and then it acquired a quite typical -i ending.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/dqgd5d/fify/f683vre/,ohitsasnaake,1572725304

That sort of metric is bound to be highly subjective, and also quite possibly wrong, since generally even most comments in English are so well written you probably couldn't tell the nationality or native language(s) of the writers if it weren't for what subs they subscribe, and some subs like this one enabling and even encouraging flairs that (generally) reveal that knowledge. So... as long as everyone writes good English and doesn't write e.g. 123.456,789, you'll probably just assume they're anglophones, but you don't *know* if they don't do some mistake that might reveal their non-native status.

To put it a bit more succinctly, if the common mistake you see is 123.456,789, all that tells you is that the ones who make mistakes with their English are probably from countries which use that standard.

2165,"&gt; Most countries had protective tariffs to help their industries develop, even today.

Exactly. Because contrary to ""free markets, free enterprises"" evangelists, that's how the developed world developed to begin with: By throwing public money at it, either directly (through subsidies) or indirectly (by putting up tariffs and non-tariff barriers).

Slave labour is quite inefficient once it faces mechanised competition. That's why it vanished after all, because it became impractical and economically inviable due to the large efficiency and productivity gap. But it's quite capable of driving down costs and helps to eek out a comparative advantage in the early stages of industrialisation, because industrialisation requires capital expenditures to get it up and running, and those expenditures don't fall out of the sky. Instead, they come out of the pre-industrial capital stock. 

Europe didn't use slaves like the US. Because they had serfs and indentured labour to do the same job.

And it doesn't matter one bit if an export economy is built around selling cotton, selling oil or selling financial derivatives. In all of those cases, those industries will crowd out everything else if you subsidise them enough, and in all of those cases, an economy may contract and suffer through the Dutch disease.",Charlemagnia - personally vouching for /u/-ah,/r/europe/comments/dqc2tf/should_germany_spend_more_to_revive_its_economy/f67dtul/,ColourFox,1572718734

&gt; Yeah no.

page 378

&gt;""A hundred castellanos are as easily obtained for a woman as for a farm, and it is very general, and there are plenty of dealers who go about looking for girls; those from nine to ten are now in demand, and for all ages a good price must be paid.""

&gt;""I assert that the violence of the calamity of turbulent persons has injured me more than my services have profited me; which is a bad example for the future. 

&gt;I take it my oath that a number of men have gone to the Indies who did not deserve water in the sight of God and of all the world; and now they are returning thither, and leave is granted them.''

He speaks against the slavery of young girls and punished those who committed these acts with mutilation and death.

&gt; Bobadilla was immediately met with complaints about all three Columbus brothers: Christopher, Bartolomeo, and Diego. Bobadilla reported to Spain that Columbus regularly used torture and mutilation to govern Hispaniola. 

Yet, they were complaining about the mutilation of there fellow colonists. The natives were also mutilated for various crimes but they didn't care about them, the tyranny they were talking about was his treatment of his fellow Spaniards. 

&gt;He was never governor after they relates him, because he was too brutal, but he was still a great sea navigator.

Considering that future governors were the ones responsible for the elimination of the natives im going to say no. 42 years of governors after Columbus brought the native population down from 200,000 to 201 (of course around 90% of these people would have died from disease but that still leaves 20,000).

&gt;No one celebrates Caesar

People love Caesar, he is viewed as a hero of the people (which is somewhat true). And the point is no one criticizes him while still approving of his achievements.

People always give him shit over initially thinking he was in India (btw when he says India he means the indies, so he thought was in Indonesia or somewhere near it), it was a perfectly reasonable conclusion to make given the circumstances and he did eventually realize he was in a new land (though he thought it southeast-ish of Asia).

2398,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus#Accusations_of_tyranny_and_brutality

&gt;By this time, accusations of tyranny and incompetence on the part of Columbus had also reached the Court. Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand responded by removing Columbus from power him with Francisco de Bobadilla, a member of the Order of Calatrava.

&gt;Arriving in Santo Domingo while Columbus was away during the explorations of his third voyage, Bobadilla was immediately met with complaints about all three Columbus brothers: Christopher, Bartolomeo, and Diego. Bobadilla reported to Spain that Columbus regularly used torture and mutilation to govern Hispaniola. The 48-page report, found in 2006 in the national archive in the Spanish city of Simancas, contains testimonies from 23 people, including both enemies and supporters of Columbus, about the treatment of colonial subjects by Columbus and his brothers during his seven-year rule.

&gt;According to the report, Columbus once punished a man found guilty of stealing corn by having his ears and nose cut off and then selling him into slavery. Testimony recorded in the report stated that Columbus congratulated his brother Bartolomeo on ""defending the family"" when the latter ordered a woman paraded naked through the streets and then had her tongue cut out for suggesting that Columbus was of lowly birth. The document also describes how Columbus put down native unrest and revolt: he first ordered a brutal crackdown in which many natives were killed, and then paraded their dismembered bodies through the streets in an attempt to discourage further rebellion.

&gt;""Columbus's government was characterised by a form of tyranny,"" Consuelo Varela, a Spanish historian who has seen the document, told journalists. ""Even those who loved him had to admit the atrocities that had taken place.""

&gt;Because of their gross misgovernance, Columbus and his brothers were arrested and imprisoned upon their return to Spain from the third voyage.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/dqii4f/bruh/f65revp/,Canal_Volphied,1572704620

""Prior to the Dersim Massacres, the *Surb Garabed Vank* (or St. Garabed Monastery) served the village‚Äôs Armenian inhabitants for centuries. The 9th century church was the only Christian place of faith in Dersim that was not destroyed during the Armenian Genocide. Sadly, this fortuitous fate was short lived, as bombings in 1937-8 completely destroyed the once-proud structure, and its last monk was exiled; most of the Armenian and Alevi communities of Dersim were either killed or uprooted. There were, however, instances of Armenians surviving‚Äîmostly by acquiring a new identity as a Kurd or Turk.

I've spent half my life trading/investing, I assure you I am perfectly aware of what's going on in the world. The reason why the rich keep getting richer is largely because of central bank policy. They are trying to inflate away a structural problem (or trying to accomodate structural changes). 

The reality is, no matter how much liquidity you create, it will not trickle down to the common worker anymore. Simply because the labor market is global now and no matter what you do, a Chinese or Vietnamese person will always be cheaper then a Frenchman. Add automation to the mix and here we are.

So what do the ones with capital do? There is no point in investing in the lower skilled people locally, so you dump that extra liquidity into stocks, real estate etc..Wherever you can, causing asset inflation. The search for yield is so desperate, that they even eat up things like Bitcoin.

2608,"Very briefly, the Franks were indeed an invading germanic tribe that happened to control varying and movable portions of the territory that would eventualy become modern France.

This lasted between the collapse of the Roman empire (~ 500 CE) to the moment when Philip II ""Augustus"" decided he was king of *France* rather than king *of the Franks*. (~1200 CE).

Roughly, that's about 7 centuries or 30 generations.

(Similar but quite different stories unfolded in the eastern parts of what would eventually be retconned as [the Frankish empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francia) by modern historians.)

During this timespan of economic and political dominance by a genetic minority, some DNA mixture undoubtedly happened. It would be quite a stretch to imagine that this was enough to melt and fuse all the preexisting populations into one unique genetic pool.

Keep in mind too that during all these centuries, and most of those thereafter, the fastest mean of transportation was to ride a horse, and that only a rarefied elite could aford to own and feed such a large animal just for the sake of moving around.

&gt; Subsequent investigations found that the parents did not suffer from any serious disability. A court even ruled in their favour. But it took more than a year for the case to move from the County Committee to higher courts, and by then Barnevernet had another reason to keep the baby in foster care.

I 100% agree!

Unfortunately, the UK disagrees about those issues itself. Leaving will not resolve the British left-right divide, nor the difficulty around some issues.

And for the refugees and people affected, these aren't 'unimportant issues,' in many cases they're life and death.

Other than that, you're broadly right: having a common monetary policy is more important than a common currency (except in social terms), forming superpower is a damn great idea, etc.

Most of your analysis works well. I just don't see how it supports Brexit. It's the step from EU flawed to leave EU that I don't get. Because the UK is arguably much more flawed.

Trump has contributed more than any other member and Trump has kept or more than kept every obligation that he made and has pushed other members to maintain their capability.  That means that Trump is increasing trust and credibility.

Underspending is an example of making it certain that you will not meet obligations even if you later change your mind and decide that you want to.  

As an example when Trump made it clear that unlike Obama he would enforce Obama's red line on Assad using WMD Merkel voiced support.  However, she did not have any aircraft to spare to actually hit back at Assad.  I remember her having to take a commercial aircraft to some meeting because she could not find any of her aircraft capable of flying.  I am not impressed.

Obviously, if Tusk with his long time pro German stance and ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù was powerless, if there was nothing to gain here then we had to accept harsh reality that our fantasies about EU solidarity and possible friendship with Germany were a folly.

*googles*

Ah, dude was apparently caught smuggling stuff in from West Germany and they used that to lean on him.

http://www.gregmitchellauthor.com/blog/gay-busted-in-east-berlin-joins-stasi

&gt;One of the most memorable characters in The Tunnels (perhaps in all of recent non-fiction, if I may be so bold) is a young West German named Siegfried Uhse. He had left the East with his mother in the late-1950s, and became a barber/hairdresser. He was also gay, which was against the law then in both West and East Germany. On his frequent visits to the East (even after the Wall arrived some West Germans could do that) he caught the attention of the Stasi secret police, who started following him. Here is an excerpt from early in my book from March 1962. Uhse, just twenty-one, would go on to be a key informer whose actions led to the arrest of dozens and the shooting of at least one tunneler, possibly more.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Uhse had served as a paid informer for the Stasi since the previous fall after he was arrested trying to smuggle 112 cigarettes to the West at the Friedrich Strasse checkpoint. An official report claimed that Uhse planned to deliver them for a weekly ‚Äúhomosexual and lesbian orgy.‚Äù The Stasi had been tailing him, probably aware that he had been arrested and sentenced to probation across the border in Baden-Baden on suspicion of being homosexual, which was against the law even in West Germany. They also discovered that he had plied an East Berlin woman with cigarettes and wine from the West so that she would let him spend evenings in a room she rented to one of his male lovers. (Black market cigarettes from the West were practically hard currency at the time.)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The young man, who had once hoped to work as a librarian, was not much interested in politics.  He now lived in a well-furnished apartment and spent nights at lounges and jazz clubs with names like the Dandy Club, Eden Saloon (favored by American tourists) and Big Apple, where he drank liberally and cultivated friends from a higher social class. He spent money beyond his means, often offering to pick up the check to impress others.

When the crime rate is relatively low like in Germany they're causing a rise in crime and in countries with relatively few immigrants they're also bad because they're running away.

3189,"&gt;Stalin expected that to happen in 1945 or later. That's why there were no defences when germans struck in 1941.

What are you talking? Stalin himself was planning to attack before 1943. The Soviet command expected there to be a war but not in -41 but in -42 or -43. And the front sure as hell wasn't undefended. 

And what the hell does 'no defences' mean? Soviets had a fully manned defensive line ready on the front and +2 million soldiers in the western front when it started.

&gt;And Germany had a plan to annex Sweden and Norway if Soviet Union took Finland, not to attack the Soviet Union. 

Good thing Germany never did any of that then. Could you imagine Germans somehow taking Norway. Hah, would never work. 

&gt;They didn't want to risk a bigger war with France/UK for something that wasn't their goal in the first place. Not that France and UK would have intervened anywhere, but Stalin was paranoid. Brits would have let Finland hang, just like they did everyone else who expected British assistance.

France was going to send troops to Finland and while these obviously would not have made a difference it would have harmed their relations with a potential state of war between the two factions. And while Stalin may have been paranoid he wasn't wrong on that one.

&gt;The goal was to secure Leningrad, not just from Germany, but from anybody who'd attack it ... And they secured it. 

Yes, no one would ever attack Leningrad as the Finnish front was now secured. And no, they specifically tried to secure it against German attack. And I would once again say that it was a pointless fear since no attack ever came from Finnish Karelia into Leningrad.

&gt; Pour faire admettre son autorit√© de souverain sur l'ensemble du royaume, Fran√ßois Ierest un roi l√©gislateur qui multiplie les actes (√©dits, ordonnances...),  innove en mati√®re d'institutions et lance de nombreuses r√©formes.

So the king decides what laws he wants to pass not the parliament. 

&gt; Le fonctionnement du gouvernement est bas√© sur l'existence d'un Conseil √©troit, r√©uni presque quotidiennement autour du roi, compos√© de membres de la haute noblesse et capable de s'adapter aux nombreux d√©placements du souverain.

So the king decides on the govt. 

&gt; L'accord conclu entre Fran√ßois Ier et le pape L√©on X, par le concordat de Bologne de 1516, va devenir un instrument d√©terminant du renforcement de l'autorit√© royale. Le monarque obtient le droit de nomination de toutes les charges eccl√©siastiques du royaume : archev√™ch√©s, √©v√™ch√©s, abbayes et prieur√©s.

So the king obtains the right to name archbishops, bishops, abots.

3233,"&gt; And the front sure as hell wasn't undefended.

It wasn't

&gt;And what the hell does 'no defences' mean? Soviets had a fully manned defensive line ready on the front and +2 million soldiers in the western front when it started.

No they didn't. Stalin has forbidden both training and establishing proper defensive fortifications in the newly conquered territories so germany doesn't see it as threatening. 

He even forbade the officers from repeating or formulating plans or training for a german attack.

Germans would have never been successful if Soviet Union was ready. The whole reason it wasn't, was Stalin. They had no ways of communication, they had no standing plans for german invasion, their standing orders never accounted for that possibility, everybody basically did whatever they wanted, most of them couldn't even communicate with their superiors or their actions. 

&gt;Serious question, do you know anything about WW2 history. Thinking that Stalin didn't think the war would start until -45 and thinking that the eastern front was undefended.

Do you ? Because you show a gross lack of knowledge thinking soviets had proper defences set up. Stalin forbade preparing for a german attack.

&gt;What are you talking? Stalin himself was planning to attack before 1943. The Soviet command expected there to be a war but not in -41 but in -42 or -43. And the front sure as hell wasn't undefended.

There was no date set for anything. Especially Stalin's attack. It might have bee 43, might have been 45, might have been 50. Depends all on how things would progress in Soviet Union and the world.

There's no point in talking to someone who believe that eastern front was defended and had a ""manned defensive line ready"", something all historians agree is wrong.

All four brand produce pretty much the same cars but focussed on different audiences, Audi is the most expensive luxury and performance brand, VW is in the middle and seat and Skoda are a bit cheaper. 
Seat kinda focusses on being sporty and semi good looking, whilst skoda is branding itself as a reliable family car. I think their similair models are just built ont he same platforms, and often stuff like buttons etc is just completely the same. For example, the audi a4?, vW Passat and Skoda octavia are the exact same car.

This is also why i feel skoda drivers are often (note the downvotes of skoda drivers raining in), middle aged family men who are disappointed with their job, wife, life, and car, because they wanted an audi, and thus drive way to agressive and annoying.

The UK should honestly leave the EU or atleast renegotiate so that the single market and United Foreign policy is the ONLY stuff they are a part of.

Policies like the Social Charter only turn EU membership into a left-right issue and further enflames the economic divides between member states.

Another fatal duck boat water accident occurred July 7, 2010, when an empty sludge barge that was being towed alongside a tugboat collided with a duck boat in the Delaware River.

Yes. This is exactly based on that. And according to the linguists bulgarian and macedonian share a lower level of mutual intelligibility than czech and slovak. Which are two different languages.

Bulgarians however are never ones to be defeated by facts.

https://i.imgur.com/Yxcq6Q4.gif

Here's a 1994 lexicostatistical research from a fairly independant authors which is pretty clear when looking at the languages that czech and slovak are 92% similar. AND THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT ACCEPTED LANGUAGES (caps lock since its important). Bulgarian and Macedonian are only 86%, and yet you claim it's bulgarian they're speaking. It's bullshit.

That generation **LITERALLY** had everything handed to them. 

And they gave us trickle-down-economics, a gutted social system, massive student debts, climate revisionism and insecure employment.

3743,"You gain refugee status when there is a risk of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion in his or her country  of origin.

Subsidiary status is given to people in risk of suffering serious harm if they returned to the country of origin. Serious harm means any of the following of:

* death penalty or execution
* torture or inhuman or degrading  treatment or punishment of an applicant in the country of origin
* serious and individual threat to a civilian's life or person by reasons  of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict.

&amp;#x200B;

These are the official definitions which pretty much cover every situation a person is in substantial danger. A denial giving refugee status or subsidiary protection to a person is actually a denial that the person's safety is in danger.

I don't know if this actually means their are other situations than economic migration left outside the definitions above, but anyway migrants openly say they are migrating for economic reasons. Watch Al Jazeera's interviews with African migrants here for example:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOYUZJWkilk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOYUZJWkilk) 

They openly say they immigrate due to poverty. There is actually a man saying that he can't return back to his country because he has said he will go to Europe and if he fails his friends are going to laugh at him, so he is determined to try as many times as needed in order to cross the Mediterranean.

Syntactically, both sentences are a question.

If the questions are rhetoric then the implied answer is ""There are terrorists etc. among migrants"", which is the statement I proved using the 2 different methods above, so I can't understand your disagreement.

In fact the first time I had dealt with it as a statement.

We are just making circles. If that was a statement, again his statement is the same with the one I proved,  so I can't understand what are you saying.

3943,"Not one of the downvoters, but here's my reply.

First, Russia's military spending is the highest in Europe, about $5bn above what the UK, the second highest spender in Europe, spends. This is also aided by significantly lower labour costs, conscription and relatively cheap internal manufacturing. But, it's peanuts compared to what the EU collectively spends on defense and the tech Russia uses is generally behind what NATO countries use. Tanks are Russia's strong point and thus this map makes them look a lot stronger than some other metrics might. In addition, Large majority of Russia's tanks are old Soviet tanks in inactive reserves of dubious value. Russia's military has significantly shrunk in size compared to the start of the century in general.

That said Russia is a fairly poor country spending a large part of it's wealth on it's military. It's clearly prepared to wage large scale war and it's been acting aggressively with it's European neighbors.

4027,"You're absolutely correct in that they are both older, far less glitz-central and had progressive views and policies. 

The difference would be in their backgrounds. Corbyn has been very one track - political demonstration/trade unionist/politician born into a labour family lived labour. 

Attlee went a very different path, an upper middle class conservative minded lawyer who, upon working in London's slums as a volunteer completely flipped to being a (very quietly spoken) radical. In the process of being a radical he worked for the treasury and gained such insight that he lectured at LSE. Then when WW1 kicked in he held the rank of captain and by most measures was quite a decent one at that. 

So by the time he started to look into politics he was expierenced in several facets of life and had the credentials people sought in their leaders. 

Add to this his willingness to dive into a coilition in the war with the man who ordered the campaign that killed so many of his friends and nearly him, his loyalty to that man then his return to his beliefs by immediately using the post war aftermath to enact as many of his radical policies as he could, changing the nation forever so much for the better. 

Corbyn has the policies, it's undeniable. But he just hasn't got the 'it' factor people seek in a leader. He is very closely linked to B.Sanders in that he is socialist (Corbyn more so) but a great deal of people don't trust older career politicians. Especially one that was a cantankerous thorn in the side of his own party for so many years, let alone of anyone else. 

So in short, policies are great, his core love him more so than we ever see in the UK, but sadly 18-35 years olds, old socialists and Islington North doesn't win general elections, sadly. 

And yes, the press are not helping a damn thing but billionaires gonna billionaire. 

I think, as I long have, he should have stepped aside to let a younger, more popular acolyte of his run on his platform and let the policies speak for themselves, free of the cloud over his rapsheet in many people's eyes.",,/r/europe/comments/dpmks2/voting_intention_of_british_adults_by_age_group/f5zsa3d/,ElTel88,1572585494
4028,"Hi, really enjoyed your examples and points of view.

But lets see on the other side. Raising the MW is not only happening to one person, your employee. It's a nation wide measure.

This will in part, on the mid-term (we can't think this changes happen in short term), create a need to raise every body. A 10‚Ç¨/h worker and is team leader on 15‚Ç¨/h can't all of a sudden be paid exactly the same, because of MW increase, without creating disparaties and demands on raise too for the team leader.
So, in the end everyone needs to be updated on their income.

So, since in the end the total amount of disposable income is higher to everyone, it doesn't mean you will always sell your lattes at 1,5‚Ç¨.
Appart from the fact that everyone buying a latte knows you/your employee costsore now, the now 2‚Ç¨latte (0,5 is a big increase just for example purposes) went from 6% (1 1,5‚Ç¨ latte for almost every workday, make it 20 days, is 30‚Ç¨, for a 500‚Ç¨ income) of the disposable income to be only ~5% (some number of lattes for an income of 750), so maybe the customer will even buy more, and you will have people that didn't buy in the past coming in as new customers. And other things stay the same price even, specially products that have minimal to low human interaction, since the cost of production barely moves. 
Again, mid-term
If your business is barely floating and scraping every month, this will be hard

4124,"""  A court in Barcelona has acquitted five men accused of gang-raping a 14 year old girl of the charge of sexual assault.

The men were convicted and jailed for the lesser crime of sexual abuse.

Under Spanish law, an offence can only be considered rape or sexual assault if physical force or intimidation is used.

The court ruled they had not committed rape because the victim was in an ""unconscious state"" and they did not need to use violence.

The decision comes despite Spain's Supreme Court reversing a similar ruling earlier this year.

Six defendants were initially charged. The five who were convicted were sentenced to between 10 and 12 years in prison.

A more serious conviction of sexual assault would have carried prison sentences of between 15 and 20 years.

Women's rights groups have reacted to the ruling with anger and dismay.

Warning: Some readers may find details of this story disturbing

The men were found guilty of abusing the girl during a drinking session known in Spanish as a botell√≥n at a disused factory in Manresa, a town in the north-eastern region of Catalonia, in October 2016.

The case became known as the ""Manada de Manresa"" - Manresa Wolf Pack - for its similarities to another 2016 gang attack on a teenager which prompted widespread protests and an ongoing review of Spain's rape laws.

What happened in this case?

Prosecutors told the court the men took turns to attack the girl, who was under the influence of alcohol and drugs.

One of the defendants, named only as Bryan Andr√©s M, was said to have told each of them: ""It's your turn. Fifteen minutes each and no delay.""

At a previous court hearing, the girl said she remembered very little of what happened but that one of the men had been brandishing a gun.

All the defendants denied the allegations, although the DNA of one of them was found on the girl's underwear.

The court ruled that the victim did ""not know what she was and wasn't doing, and consequently, did not have the ability to agree to or oppose the sexual relations most of the defendants had with her"", El Pais reported.

It added that the defendants ""were able to commit sexual acts without using any type of violence or intimidation"".

The court awarded the victim ‚Ç¨12,000 (¬£10,300) damages for an attack it described as ""extremely severe and especially denigrating"".
What happened in original 'wolf pack' case?

A court in Navarra jailed five men for sexual abuse for a gang attack in Pamplona on an 18-year-old woman who was dragged into the hallway of a residential building.

As she appeared ""passive or neutral"", according to a police report, the court decided no intimidation or violence had taken place.
Media captionActivists say rage over Spain's ""wolfpack"" case has ignited a feminist revolution

In June, the Spanish Supreme Court overturned that ruling, deciding it was sexual assault and that the men were rapists. The five saw their sentences of nine years increased to 15.

Spain's prime minister last year appointed a panel to review the rape laws. """,,/r/europe/comments/dpyr7h/men_cleared_of_raping_unconscious_state_teenager/f5zjh79/,Puffin_fan,1572578432

Poland is still a major issue, politically, the newcomers aren't embracing the core member's agenda, they are setting up their own which can be summed up by ""give us money, don't ask us anything else in return besides market access"". 

It's a bit like Brexit. Until we know and agree on what we ALL want for the EU, we shouldn't make hasty decisions and put ourselves in danger to lose everything. If we want more integration until federalization, what do we do with those who do not want that? When we didn't prepare and have no means to boot them up?

Before any more enlargement, we need to make sure that any commitment done by anyone can be legally enforced. To avoid the UK's refusal to pay its debt to ever happen again. We should also make sure that proper sanctions that can lead to proper expulsion exists, so we don't have to deal with Hungary or Poland BS ever again. You don't play by the rules? Goodbye.

4237,"&gt;How should a prosecution be carried out  
&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately, it seems clear that the International Criminal Court, the ICC, will not be able to address crimes committed by IS, due to the expected vetoes that would be brought up in the Security Council from Russia and China. Even if that were not the case, ICC's resources would probably not suffice for the thousands of cases in question.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is important to find solutions that are both politically and legally possible.  We assert that responsible states, in close cooperation with international legal expertise, should request from the Iraqi government that it allows the establishment of special court within the autonomous Kurdish region of Iraq.   To only pass judgments on acts carried out by IS. In a manner that of course, respects Iraq's integrity. The offenses of the Syrian regime and other actors may be prosecuted in other ways and at different times. It is quite unlikely that the Syrian regime would allow such a court on Syrian soil.  
&gt;  
&gt;Secretary-General and Security Council that the international community should ensure that members of IS / Daesh are held accountable for their crimes in Iraq, including those that constitute crimes against humanity. The Security Council unanimously passed a resolution demanding responsibility for IS / Daesh mass abuse. International teams work on the task of collecting and preserving evidence in both Iraq and Syria.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Iraqi government however demanded in august of 2017, addressing the UN Secretary-General and Security Council that the international community ensure that members of IS / Daesh are held accountable for their crimes in Iraq, including those that constitute crimes against humanity. The Security Council unanimously passed a resolution demanding responsibility for IS / Daesh mass abuse. International teams work actively the task of collecting and preserving evidence in both Iraq and Syria.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sweden, at Iraq's request, has made available a military force to participate within the training effort carried out by the global coalition against IS / Daesh. Some kurdish forces have by Sweden been trained to fight IS.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Swedish government body for societal protection and preparation, shortened to MSB, has through a collective project given support to Iraqi Kurdistan to help a large number of refugees, refugees created by IS.  
&gt;  
&gt;We assume that the local Kurdish government will welcome an international tribunal within the Iraqi Kurdish zone. This would be a natural continuation of the Swedish and the global communities broad support to Iraq. And now that IS is losing ground in Irak and Syria - we also assume that Iraq's government will accept an independent and specialized tribunal.  
&gt;  
&gt;If this takes place, action from the global security council would not be needed. With the N√ºrnbergtribunal as a role model, a guiding document for the legal procedure could be created which specifies that the act of voluntary joining IS is a crime. The death penalty should not be allowed, regardless of the level of cruelty that the individual has carried out. Kompetent judges and other legal experts can be appointed through international collaboration. Our demand is that the current camp in Rojava is also fixed so as to live up to the UN:s criteria for human imprisonment. That fair investigations are carried out and that those who are prosecuted are eventually transferred to face trial in Iraq. This system should be amended with prisons over the globe preparing to, under human conditions and with programs oriented towards rehabilitation and reconciliation in mind, house IS-members.  
&gt;

And you did so by only bringing up education-related infrastructure.

&gt; And about research? How should that fight the imbalance? Does she think that the German citizens are willing to fund non-German research projects?

Investing in research within Germany provides long-run positive returns, boosts aggregate demand, reduces the current account surplus and creates spillover demand in the eurozone. Investing in a space program would do the same but probably to a lesser degree.

&gt; Germany is at an 3.1% unemployment rate. I always say that there is a hard number of people who are basically unemployable, we are at that point.

Full employment does not mean that the construction industry is at maximum productivity in the medium- or long-term or that infrastructure investment is wasted. In those circumstances investments in infrastructure will result in higher wages, more private investments in capital and consequentially higher aggregate demand and higher productivity. It would also result in price increases, but the extent to which those would negate the benefits depends on the specific target and circumstances of the investment.",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/dpismb/lagarde_hits_out_at_germany_and_netherlands_on/f5yp2s1/,blunderbolt,1572559633

4342,"&gt; Manufacturing is the single biggest economic sector in Estonia.

You just said that it was services. Stop confusing your self.

&gt;That was fall of an empire, something that happened to most of Europe. Could've happened without any civil war just as well.

It was a civil war, whatever the causes of it.  No one calls it anything but ""Russian civil war"". You asked me to name one, I did. You on the other hand still didn't name a single one without foreign troop participation.

&gt;But didn't you hint something else before? You said countries pick USA over Russia and we are ""doing US bidding"". Isn't Germany among them?

It is, and hence sanctions on Germany for supporting NS2.

&gt; Germany and France are totally okay, even if they are in NATO, but pitiful irrelevancies like Baltics are certainly US puppets when they do exactly the same.

No, as stated above they are not ok, but they do have more means to resist. 

&gt;And I provided you with three, one of which had data for a longer period. 

You do realize that December 2013 is before January 2014?

&gt;Yet Ukraine's government has long been legitimized now with democratic elections. Also, I don't get how mess in Ukraine gives any neighbouring countries rights to invade it...

Sure, but it doesn't make the coup any less illegal.  So if Russia would to democratically elect a new leader, would it entitle it to retake all old territories of Russian empire? No. The same way, Ukraine is not entitled to retake the territories it lost due to an illegal coup. 

&gt;. This is incorporating a territory of one country into another, this is not stuff you do like ""ahh, most support it anyway, no need to follow any legal procedures"".

But it did follow legal procedure. UN ruled that unilateral declarations of independence are not illegal. And after Crimea declared its independence it held referendum withing their local laws to join Russia. And it did. 

&gt;  ultimately, they failed, as their representation in the government remained weak.

Of course they failed, Right Sector, Svoboda, Azov... are just stupid neo-nazis, they were used and discarded. I don't disagree with you there. 

&gt;Okay, can you get me news on:

4435,"&gt; First of all, infrastructure/construction is not the only thing a government can spend its budget on(as Lagarde explicitly stated). 

I noted education (her 2nd example) in my reply. 

And about research? How should that fight the imbalance? Does she think that the German citizens are willing to fund non-German research projects? If anything it would increase the intellectual property advantage for Germany in the future.

Heck, if burning the money really is the goal, then i would rather nuke it on a European Space and Mars program. At least this would inspire the people that working together can achieve great things.

&gt; and your first hand experience is not evidence to the contrary. 

Actually it is evidence. It's only a singular small point, but it is evidence.

Evidence to the contrary, that there is no shortage, however has not been delivered.

I could even substantiate my first hand experience more, because the costs we now have to pay for construction have basically doubled within 5 years. All our estimates on costs, that used to be very accurate are way below the actual offers we get. 

And while it used to be the case that we could advertise our projects and get a 90%+ reply rate with offers, now we get 25-50%. The contractors themselves say, when we ask them for an offer, that they can't make one because they are booked out.

Heck, go ask any manual-laborer in Germany, like car mechanics, they will complain about worker shortages. You can't repair a car with IT guys like me, and neither can i help with building a street. Though that's not entirely true, because no car mechanic had the time, i had to reproduce my hand-brake cable for my 39 year old Datsun 280zx myself.

I think your missing a few key details here when people fear about this. First and foremost, our number 1 trading partner is the EU, most of our goods go through there, we just pissed them off, in addition leaving means we will be paying more by default. UK economy has been uneasy for a while, we got hit hard by 2008 and are bouncing back and fourth since leaving the EU is a sudden and shocking blow.

Theres no reason to assume China and USA aren't gonna swoop in here. Keep in mind the Trump administration has a very childish mindset when it comes to trade deals, to them its a win or loss game, theres no reason to assume they wont exploit our weakened state. Same goes for China. 

When Canada and Australia became free from the empire, they did so on very good terms with Britain and in a very different era in human history. Us becoming free from the EU, well theres still so much we haven't got sorted yet and safe to say will not get sorted. In short, yes we are fucked.

And yet you only single out GMOs. 

&gt;Do you have any witty one-liners for one who ignores the evidence presented to him such as yourself?

You have presented zero evidence. 

&gt;The one you linked urges for ""GMO ‚Äòrethink‚Äô"" not a blanket approval for all of them.

Who said anything about blanket approval?

The EFSA has said that GMOs pose no new or novel risks compared to other breeding methods. You're asserting that they do. 

&gt;Again, I'm all for this.

But you aren't. That's the point. You're not taking the evidence into account. You're not relying on the experts. You're using your gut and what you feel is common sense. 

&gt;I'd rather have to deal with critics like yourself instead of dealing with long lasting negative consequences.

The problem with your position is that you don't see the long lasting negative consequences of ignoring the science in favor of unwarranted delays. 

How about you deal with the Africans who suffer from malnutrition when your line of thinking outweighs the experts? Do you not care about them?

(I know, I used ESS data for my master's thesis :-) )
From the website:

""The first edition of European Social Survey (ESS) Round 9 data - collected in 19 countries during late 2018 and early 2019 - has been published today (31 October 2019).

This initial Round 9 dataset is available to download in SAS, SPSS and STATA formats from our website or can be viewed or downloaded via our Online Analysis Tool.

Data included in this release was collected in: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czechia, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Serbia, Slovenia, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

The release also includes data for 18 of the 19 countries collected in a questionnaire of interviewers and test data (multitrait-multimethod).

In Round 9 of our survey, questions were fielded on the timing of life events (repeated from Round 3, 2006/07) and justice and fairness, in the context of respondents‚Äô income.

The Timing of Life questions aim to understand the views of respondents about the organisation of their lifetime and strategies to plan their own lives.

It provides data on what people think should be youngest age and oldest age of key events in life, such as marriage, having children and planning for retirement.

Justice and Fairness provides survey data for the first time on how people feel that they are coping with increasing economic and educational inequalities.

It also included questions about building widely accepted political and societal institutions, integrating migrants into society and ensuring ecological and social sustainability.

The main questionnaire includes over 150 survey items, including a question on how people would vote in a referendum on EU membership that was included in Round 8 for the first time and has now been repeated.

It also includes regular ESS questions on: media and social trust, politics, subjective well-being, social exclusion, religion, national and ethnic identity, the human values scale and a wide range of socio-demographic measures.

It is the highest number of countries that have been included in one of our first releases since the first set of Round 6 (2012/13) data was published in October 2013.

Please note that post stratification weights will only be made available alongside the second data release.""",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/dpnirf/first_data_from_the_european_social_survey_round/f5xb8dk/,Thanalas,1572538202

I've already stated I'm not against GMOs. I'm pro long term testing before wide scale approval which is the current general stance of the EU and that of the pharmaceutical industry worldwide.

&gt; How about you deal with the Africans who suffer from malnutrition when your line of thinking outweighs the experts? Do you not care about them?

&gt; And you can't just pass this off as having nothing to do with you. The reason many African nations refuse to adopt GM crops is directly related to the nonsense coming from modern nations who also reject the science.

Playing the emotional card isn't scientific evidence.

Even so, what's stopping Monsanto from giving away free GMO corn that isn't banned in Africa to people in Africa so that they don't starve? Unless you're assuming that ALL GMOs are banned in ALL Africa, there's no reason for them not to end starvation there.

That's the whole problem. We have guys like him over here as well.

But they get 20% support, *max*. In reality, it's even less. In Parliament, they have about 15% of the votes.

40% of Americans support that Trump, so I guess it's safe to say the US *is* kinda shit these days. I wouldn't wanna live there.

Space is kind of an issue in the Netherlands. Sure there's room, farmland converted to solar parks but you can only do that so much before you affect nature itself.

Nuclear power is a thing that IPCC, NASA ect all say is a must have to reduce emissions fast enough in the energy sector. Sure solar may be cheaper, wind may be cheaper but they can be supplemental and are two vastly different ways to close coal power plants. Sad thing is, green parties are against it because of the waste (which is totally manageable just not economically viable to use a breeder reactor but probably will be in the future, beat coal any day though). Greenpeace for instance is pushing really hard to stop nuclear power plants. Germany doesn't even touch the subject with a 10 feet pole and that sentiment is affecting surrounding countries as well.

It's not breaking the EU up into seperate countries when the EU is already made up of seperate countries and many of those countries are already under the influence of China and Russia to various degrees.

Well, you're a Czech, yes?  Would you say, on a scale of challenges to deal with, things are more-difficult or less-difficult for a Czech than they were in 1938?  1948?  1968?

I'm thinking things probably looked pretty tough at those dates.  *Probably*, I'm thinking, a good deal more-difficult than they did now.  But Czechs then didn't sit down and say ""it all seems so difficult to do anything -- surely nothing can be done"".  They moved things from where they were then to where they are now.

The EU didn't take some sort of smooth and unbroken path to get from where it kicked off to where it is today.  My country didn't, your country didn't, no country did.

There are a set of issues to be dealt with.  They are not unaddressable.  Some of them are serious, and my layman's take is also that not everyone is doing the best job of pulling together to address them.

[De Volkskrant](https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/kabinet-wil-staatsschuld-fors-verhogen-voor-extra-investeringen~b016843c/): Dutch government wants to raise national debt for extra investments

&gt; **The government is considering borrowing tens of billions of extra euros to pay for future investments in infrastructure, education and innovation.** This investment fund is intended to make the Dutch economy future-proof as the economic outlook deteriorates again. This is confirmed by sources in The Hague following reports in De Telegraaf.

&gt; The plan for the new billions fund comes from Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra. He wants to make maximum use of the fact that the Dutch government can borrow money for free on the financial markets. In fact, borrowing now provides the government with money. Since the beginning of this month, the returns on all Dutch government bonds have been negative, even on government bonds with a term of 30 years. This means that investors in the Netherlands are so keen to borrow money that they are prepared to pay for it.


&gt;This is an unprecedented, bizarre situation that comes down to 'the upside down world'. After all, a borrower normally has to pay interest, not the lender. Economists do not agree on the reasons for this strange interest rate situation, but the European Central Bank's 'ultra-low interest rate policy', the fear of a new crisis and the ageing of the population in Western economies are many of the possible causes mentioned. Germany, too, can borrow for free at the moment. Both the Netherlands and Germany are known in the world of investors as financially reliable governments that are good for their money. This reputation has been rewarded for decades with favourable borrowing conditions and now even negative interest rates. The investors who want to pay for Dutch government bonds assume that the interest rate will fall even further, so that they can still sell these bonds at a profit on the stock exchange later on.

&gt; Minister Hoekstra wants to make a profit out of this for the treasury very profitable, but perhaps short term situation. By increasing the national debt by tens of billions in the short term, the government can put those billions away for profit in a fund for bad times. The plan was discussed during the first meeting of the coalition summit after the summer recess on Monday and during the pile-driving session in Oisterwijk with the rest of the cabinet on Tuesday. Most ministers would have welcomed the proposal enthusiastically.

&gt; **Opportunistically crushing billions**
&gt; The government now wants to have a study carried out into how the fund should be structured and the risks associated with the plan. As treasurer, Hoekstra will probably want to prevent the billions borrowed from being surprised by opportunistic goals that do not structurally strengthen the Dutch economy, but that do allow politicians to make themselves popular with the voters. Measures such as the increase in the state pension or teacher's salaries, for example, cannot be paid for them, because these are structural expenditure increases. From a budgetary point of view, these cannot be financed with a one-off extra loan.

&gt; In the next Budget Memorandum it will probably be announced that the government will have a study carried out into the establishment of such an investment fund. How much the government wants to borrow extra and for what purpose will only become clear later, but before the end of the year. It seems certain that this will amount to more than 10 billion euros, because otherwise such an investment fund will be too ineffective. Suitable uses for the money could be: the urgently needed expansion of the railway network, extra investments in technological research and education and subsidies that could serve as a lubricant for the climate transition.

&gt; The Dutch national debt currently amounts to approximately EUR 400 billion. That is approximately 49% of gross domestic product (GDP), well below the European budget norm of 60%. According to the latest estimate by the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, the government will be left with money for the fourth year in a row in 2019. Hoekstra is heading for a budget surplus of around 10 billion euros. If the Netherlands were to borrow an additional 20 to 50 billion euros for its investment fund, the national debt would rise to 51% to 54% of GDP. This is still well below the euro zone standard.

&gt; On Budget Day, the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis will also devote a - probably critical - paragraph to the question of whether the Netherlands should borrow extra money now that it is able to do so interest-free. The CPB tends to be cautious, because a higher national debt can quickly become a problem if the economy turns into a recession or if interest rates start to rise again.",Amsterdam,/r/europe/comments/dpismb/lagarde_hits_out_at_germany_and_netherlands_on/f5w0rrs/,LucoBuck,1572510125

European Union ambassadors backed a former anti-corruption crusader from Romania to become the European Union‚Äôs [first chief prosecutor], defying objections from her own government and other leaders‚Äô endorsement of a rival candidate.

Booted from her job at home after leading a drive that put scores of top-level officials behind bars, Laura Codruta Kovesi won support from the bloc‚Äôs representatives to establish an office that investigates and prosecutes crimes including fraud against the bloc‚Äôs 140 billion-euro ($155 billion) budget.

‚ÄúI hope today‚Äôs vote and this appointment, once finalized, will encourage all the prosecutors and judges to continue the fight against corruption despite all the pressure they face,‚Äù Kovesi said in a phone interview. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clearly a victory of the entire judiciary system.‚Äù

Despite winning support from EU lawmakers in February, her candidacy was challenged when the bloc‚Äôs governments endorsed French rival Jean-Francois Bohnert. It took months of political wrangling to reach an agreement.

‚ÄúThis victory has two ingredients: Kovesi‚Äôs impressive reputation and trust among member states and citizens, and the second is the political negotiation that took place in which we all used all our efforts to support this candidacy,‚Äù Siegfried Muresan, vice president of the [European People‚Äôs Party] group in the European Parliament, said by phone on Thursday.

Future Conflict

The approval, expected to receive final ratification by EU government leaders, may set the stage for future conflict with some member states, including in the bloc‚Äôs former communist east like Poland and Hungary, which have clashed with Brussels over the rule of law.

It‚Äôs also a blow against Romania‚Äôs ruling Socialist party, which has repeatedly tried to throw up barriers to an unprecedented fight against corruption spearheaded by the 46-year-old lawyer.

The Socialist-led government has tried to force through changes to judicial legislation, bringing hundreds of thousands of Romanians into the streets in protests.

The party defied international objections and fired her as chief prosecutor last year after efforts led to the imprisonment of top officials, including former Socialist leader and Prime Minister Liviu Dragnea.

Prime Minister Viorica Dancila said on Thursday that her government doesn‚Äôt endorse Kovesi for the top EU prosecutor post. Despite recent promises from Dancila to refrain from more judiciary law changes, the Council of Europe [warned] Romania again in July over its lack of progress in fighting corruption.",,/r/europe/comments/dpjoi6/antigraft_crusader_wins_uphill_battle_for_top_eu/f5vwt1m/,bumsrind,1572503890

5201,"Christine Lagarde has called on Germany and the Netherlands to use their budget surpluses to fund investments that would help stimulate the economy, in a sharp rebuke that comes only days before she becomes European Central Bank president.
The former head of the IMF said there ‚Äúisn‚Äôt enough solidarity‚Äù in the single currency area, adding: ‚ÄúWe share a currency, but we don‚Äôt share much budgetary policy for now.‚Äù
‚ÄúThose that have the room for manoeuvre, those that have a budget surplus, that‚Äôs to say Germany, the Netherlands, why not use that budget surplus and invest in infrastructure? Why not invest in education? Why not invest in innovation, to allow for a better rebalancing?‚Äù asked Ms Lagarde. 
Normally ECB officials avoid naming individual countries in public statements, because their mandate is to act in the interests of the eurozone as a whole. But Ms Lagarde has not yet officially taken over at the Frankfurt-based institution ‚Äî she succeeds Mario Draghi on Friday.
The German and Dutch governments, which last year had budget surpluses of 2 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively, ‚Äúhave not really made the necessary efforts‚Äù, she added.
She also defended the negative interest rates introduced by her predecessor Mr Draghi, arguing that people should be ‚Äúhappier‚Äù to have a job than a higher savings rate.
Speaking to RTL radio in France on Wednesday, Ms Lagarde added her voice to Mr Draghi‚Äôs earlier calls for the creation of a common eurozone budget. 
The comments by the former French finance minister confirm market expectations that she is likely to pursue similar monetary policy strategy to Mr Draghi. He flooded the financial system with cheap money to fight slowing growth and inflation while calling on governments to do more through fiscal policy to take the burden off the central bank.
Economists believe the ECB‚Äôs toolbox is almost empty as concern grows about the corrosive side-effects of negative rates on financial institutions and its bond-buying programme nears self-imposed limits on how much of each country‚Äôs debt it can own. 
When asked about the impact of negative rates on savers, Ms Lagarde said on Thursday that they should think about how much worse the situation would be if the ECB had not cut rates as much as it had. 
‚ÄúWould we not be in a situation today with much higher unemployment and a far lower growth rate, and isn‚Äôt it true that ultimately we have done the right thing to act in favour of jobs and of growth rather than the protection of savers?‚Äù she asked.
The unemployment rate in the 19-country eurozone has fallen from 12 per cent in 2013 to 8.2 per cent last year. GDP growth in the single currency zone was 1.8 per cent last year and the ECB expects it to slow to 1.1 per cent this year.
‚ÄúWe should be happier to have a job than to have our savings protected,‚Äù said Ms Lagarde. ‚ÄúI think that it is in this spirit that monetary policy has been decided by my predecessors and I think they made quite a beneficial choice.‚Äù
Last month the ECB reacted to slowing growth and inflation by cutting its key deposit rate to minus 0.5 per cent and announcing open-ended plans to start buying ‚Ç¨20bn of bonds from next month.",Lake Bled connoisseur,/r/europe/comments/dpismb/lagarde_hits_out_at_germany_and_netherlands_on/f5vrvvc/,MelodicBerries,1572497700

Lithuanians greatest victory during this time against Russia was Orsha and even then more then half the soldiers (espedcialy the heavy armored knights) were crown soldiers. 

While Poland and the TO 

After Tannenberg , Poles won Koronovo battle after Lithuanians went home 

Hunger war (1414) Poland won, they used scorch earth tactics and starved Teutonic Knights 

13 years war (1454 - 66) Poland annexed part of Prussia, Lithuania did not help.

War of the Priests (1479) TO refused to swear feulty to Poland so Poland invaded and occupied TO castles. 

War of 1519- 21 Poland kicked out the TO and made Prussia fief.

&gt;Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, despite the fact that eastern European states have became wealthier, the poor in these states have become poorer and the rich richer. In the 1980s, the total earnings of the poorer half of east Europeans was equivalent to 25-35% of national income. Since the end of communism, this figure has dropped to 17% in some countries. The most unequal country in the region is Russia, where the richest 1% now earns 27% of national income ‚Äì a dramatic increase from 3.5% before the fall of the iron curtain.

The author and people like her know perfectly well that it misleads the reader to use stuff like this, as the reader understands ""poor"" to be an absolute measurement of living conditions, not a measurement of how equal income is.

5329,"The tax-to-GDP ratio indicates what portion of the economic activity is going to taxes.

So if one-quarter of all economic activity goes to taxation, that's 25 percentage points.  The higher this number is, the larger the role of the government in the economy (that is, it's using the money on things like education subsidies or military spending or whatever).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_to_GDP_ratio

A few numbers to get a baseline:

|Country|Ratio (%)|
|-|-:|
|France|47.9|
|Germany|44.5|
|Estonia|33.8|
|Canada|31.7|
|United States|27.1|
|Mexico|23.7|
|China|20.1|
|Russia|19.5|
|Taiwan|13.0|

The bar is showing how many percentage points this number has changed from 2017.  If it's to the right, the government is taking in a larger portion of the economy as taxes.

My layman's guess is that on a year-to-year basis, this is probably kinda volatile -- that is, I would guess that it doesn't say as much about whether a country is going more ""big government"" or ""small government"" so much as it does show up things like tax rule changes, wars/economic crises, and so forth.

5423,"&gt; Arrested for not giving up his passwords?

Note that this was apparently at the border.

The UK *does* have a police power -- RIPA -- that permits them to demand passwords anywhere.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_Investigatory_Powers_Act_2000

&gt;Especially contentious was Part III of the Act, which requires persons to (allegedly) self-incriminate by disclosing a password to government representatives. Failure to do so is a criminal offence, with a penalty of two years in jail or five years in cases involving national security or child indecency.[14] Using the mechanism of secondary legislation, some parts of the Act required activation by a ministerial order before attaining legal force. Such orders have been made in respect of the relevant sections of Part I and Part II of the RIP Act and Part III. The latter became active in October 2007.[15] The first case where the powers were used was against animal rights activists in November 2007.[16] 

The police power was a source of a great deal of controversy when it was passed.

In the US, such a law is disallowed by the Fifth Amendment (not, somewhat counterintuitively, the Fourth).

However, while it is not permissable to *criminalize* it, border control agents in the US *do* have the ability to turn away someone who is not a US citizen at the border if they have a password-protected device and refuse to turn over the password.

https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017

&gt;If you are a U.S. citizen, border agents cannot stop you from entering the country, even if you refuse to unlock your device, provide your device password, or disclose your social media information. However, agents may escalate the encounter if you refuse. For example, agents may seize your devices, ask you intrusive questions, search your bags more intensively, or increase by many hours the length of detention. If you are a lawful permanent resident, agents may raise complicated questions about your continued status as a resident. If you are a foreign visitor, agents may deny you entry.

My guess is that many countries probably have more leverage than would normally be the case at the border, since guarding the border is also considered important...",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/dp9k59/britain_first_investigated_by_counterterror/f5uzxrz/,duisThias,1572481735

It's bullshit that the Albanians didn't have educational rights and what not. Also, what do you think about the current state of rights the Serbs have in their own land? No freedom of movement, constant oppression, no freedom of speech, etc. What do you have to say to that?

About ethnic cleansing, you could find videos of NATO forces dragging Serbian bodies from graveyards to the Raƒçak village and the rest. Some even say you could see Orthodox crosses on the coffins. I admit, there were massacres and the rest committed, but it was by both sides. It's just, one side got judged for it and the other did not. The UCK was considered a terrorist organisation by the US up until the war. What do you think about the 2004 ethnic cleansing of the Serbs from Kosovo? When the KFOR forces were removed from the area to make it easier for the Serbs to leave! Shouldn't KFOR protect the both people? That explains why I don't thrust anything western.

5624,"&gt; I live in a neighbouring country of Russia. This ""USA is evil"" doesn't sell well here. 

I know, you are US allies and you do their bidding. That's why you don't have problems with them. But have a look at Turkey, it tried to be friendly with Russia and buy some stuff from them? What did US did? Did they allow them to do so? No, it's straight sanctions. right away (and this happened before Turkish incursion into Syria). Same with Germany, Germany wanted to improve their ability to buy Russian gas. What did US do? Sanctions! That's what it means to be the US ally. It mean you do everything you are told to, if US wants you to break an international law and ground a plane of foreign president, then you do it! (The Snowden incident)  

So the reason why USA is evil doesn't sell well there, is because over there you are dutiful lap dogs who do what master commands. And the master is very grateful and gives you pats on the back. But you really don't want to be on the other side of your master's patience.

&gt;USA did not tell Ukraine to hate Russia

Of course not, it just gave a lot of grants to nationalistic NGOs to promote ""patriotism"" and western values. If you don't think that those kind of grants work then why do you think US keeps spending money on them?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War

According to the casualties section, 25,000-70,000 Americans died in the war compared to ~7,000 French. A total of ~200,000 American army men, and militiamen, served during the course of the war, compared to ~63,000 French and Spanish, who were primarily in Gibraltar, not in the United States itself. So this evidence would indicate that American men were doing the meat of the fighting for their homeland.

Now, where the French did contribute much, was in their Navy. The American Navy was fairly poor and ill-equipped, therefore the French had to step in with 146 ships-of-the-line to help battle the formidable British Navy, and form supply blockades. This was an instrumental help, no doubt, and *we are taught this in school.*

But at the end of the day American men lost by far the most lives here in the US, and did the lion's share of the fighting for independence.

No.  First, how would Coalition forces know that there are civilian hostages mixed in with Iraqi army? The ground war campaign was over extremely quickly (~4 days) so it's not like there was tons of time to develop a lot of intelligence as to the makeup of the retreating force.

Second, there is nothing criminal about attacking retreating troops.  Attacking troops that have already surrendered is bad, but if they haven't surrendered and are just trying to evade capture, that doesn't entitle them to protection.  Troops that retreat are completely free to redeploy elsewhere and fight another day.

5752,"&gt;It was a based on historical wrong done by Croatians, Bosniaks and Albanians against Serbs.

I'd disagree with that one. Shit started when (after the fall of the UdSSR) Croatia and Slovenia democratically elected parties that wanted to secede from Yugoslavia, followed by successful referenda - and then Serbian forces intervened against the secessionists. Not exactly democratic for me, quite the opposite.

The biggest problem IMO is that the Croatian forces driving the secession based upon Nazi/Ustasa ideology, and that this ideology remains at the top in Croatia to this day.

&gt;and the 90's wars will just feed into the next atrocities and wars against Serbs if no truth and reconciliation is done.

I don't believe there will be open wars again between Croatia, Slovenia and Serbia again, not in the near future. The border conflicts there are settled and no one, no matter the rhetoric, wants to start yet another bloodshed. The future pain points will be Bosnia with the split between Bosnians, Serbs and Croatians - and, more on a non-violent basis, that Serbia aligns more and more towards China (there are Chinese police officers [patrolling in Belgrad](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/serbien-warum-chinas-polizisten-in-belgrad-streife-gehen-a-1293088.html), WTF is this shit?!) instead of the EU.

For what it's worth I would prefer if both the HDZ and the SNS get dissolved. Both are not doing anything positive towards healing the wounds of the wars and the hateful rhetoric towards the others is, frankly, fucked up.

The American Revolution wasn't a tax revolt that ended up having some ideological attachments. It's causes are myriad, one of the key one's is taxation. But a call for a more 'enlightened' government is also key. In popular* involvement, which was vital to its success and in maintaining the momentum of the movement. But most importantly in creating a world in which this is possible. The particular tax circumstances led to the revolution, sure, but they never would have done in a world without the writing of, say, John Locke.

The priest was set up by a youtube personality, whose shtick is arranging sting operations against suspected paedophiles. The youtuber believed the priest was searching Polish forums to find a wheelchair bound (appears to be the priest's fetish) underage boy for sex. He tipped off the police, but after the priest's arrest it turned out that the young man who agreed to meet the priest was 18 years old and the priest was aware that the young man is not underage. The police released the priest and dropped all charges saying that they don't know why the informant (the youtuber) assumed the priest was seeking an underage boy.

[Wikipedia: anti-Canadianism: ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Canadianism)

&gt;In the United States, Canada is often a target of conservative and right-wing commentators who hold the nation up as an example of what a government and society that are too liberal would look like.
&gt;
&gt;""Soviet Canuckistan"" (full name being The People's Republic of Soviet Canuckistan) is an epithet for Canada, used by Pat Buchanan on October 31, 2002, on his television show on MSNBC in which he denounced Canadians as anti-American and the country as a haven for terrorists. He was reacting to Canadian criticisms of US security measures regarding Arab Canadians.[4]
&gt;
&gt;Buchanan has a history of unflattering references to Canada, having said in 1990 that if Canada were to break apart due to the failure of the Meech Lake Accord, ""America would pick up the pieces.""[5] He said two years after that ""for most Americans, Canada is sort of like a case of latent arthritis. We really don't think about it, unless it acts up.""[6]
&gt;
&gt;In the wake of Canada's refusal to participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, as well as its turning down of the Missile Defense Plan (CMDP), conservative commentators Ann Coulter and Tucker Carlson have become prominent American critics of Canadian policies. Coulter has during interviews proposed extreme solutions to Canadian dissent, even military invasion, and has said that Canada should be grateful that the US ""allows"" it to exist on the same continent,[7] while Carlson has mocked that ""without the US, Canada is essentially Honduras, only less interesting"".[8]
&gt;
&gt;In 2006, right-wing American strategist Paul Weyrich said Canadians are ""so liberal and hedonistic"" that they have a philosophy of ""cultural Marxism.""[9]
&gt;
&gt;In 2009, a panel of commentators on the Fox News Channel talk show Red Eye with Greg Gutfeld satirically mocked the Canadian military for avoiding war, sparking outrage in Canada, which had troops on active combat duty in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2011 and has since transitioned to a training role. The host of the show later apologized for his remarks.[10]
&gt;
&gt;""Canuckistan"" has since been adopted by some Canadians and others as a non-insulting nickname for Canada.[11]",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/dp39vi/a_hedgehogstel_instead_of_importing_halloween_try/f5t7sdy/,duisThias,1572452333

No, diplomats job is to talk with other governments, not to interfere in domestic processes.

no, they decided to opt for Russia, then there was an illegal, foreign sponsored coup that overthrew the democratically elected government.

5952,"Not entirely true.

Tito was instrumental in keeping the individual nations happy and part of Yugoslavia. Following his death, there was uncertainty and a power vacuum. Serbia decided to take advantage of that and claim the power. 

All other states refused out of concern Serbia would only serve Serbia and decided to go their own way. Serbia did not like this, and started claiming these areas inherently being to Serbia. This is around the time that nationalism took off in Serbia and the Cetniks, who the Serbian government have a platform to.

Talks of making a Greater Serbia started happening. This is very different than Yugoslavia where the individual nations that made up Yugoslavia had a degree of sovereignty. It was against the original agreement.

As the nations pushed for complete Independence from Greater Serbia, Serbia attacked them. First Slovenia, who successfully fought back. Then Croatia, where the first signs of war crimes committed by Serbs happened. Croatia ultimately succeeded in fighting back. By the time the Bosnian war happened, Serbia learned their lessons and that's where the worst war crimes and genocide happened. Other nations were forced to intervene and try to negotiate a peace that still plagues Bosnia to this day. Later, Serbia attacked Albania, claiming Kosovo belonged to them, committed war crimes and more genocide and finally they were bombed and they stopped.

I'm tired of the white washing of these events and the claims of ""well everyone did bad things,"" or ""everyone had nationalism."" People don't like to point the finger because war sucks in general for everyone, but there was a very clear aggressor in these conflicts, and only one nation whose intent was to ethnically cleanse so they can take the land. I don't mind pointing the finger in that case because that's what happened. 

Lessons and books can be written on how the Serbian government succeeded in using religion and nationalism to radicalize their citizens to commit war crimes on literally their neighbors in some cases. It's frightening how easy and how quickly they did it. And those assholes got to evade the law for years, being treated as heros, while even their own population had to learn to live on.
