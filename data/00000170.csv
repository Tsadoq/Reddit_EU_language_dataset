OBJECTIVE 17: Eliminate all forms of discrimination and promote evidence-based public discourse to shape perceptions of migration  33.  We commit to eliminate all forms of discrimination, condemn and counter expressions, acts and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, violence, xenophobia and related intolerance against all migrants in conformity with international human rights law. We further commit to promote an open and evidence-based public discourse on migration and migrants in partnership with all parts of society, that generates a more realistic, humane and constructive perception in this regard. We also commit to protect freedom of expression in accordance with international law, recognizing that an open and free debate contributes to a comprehensive understanding of all aspects of migration.  To realize this commitment, we will draw from the following actions:  a)  Enact, implement or maintain legislation that penalizes hate crimes and aggravated hate crimes targeting migrants, and train law enforcement and other public officials to identify, prevent and respond to such crimes and other acts of violence that target migrants, as well as to provide medical, legal and psychosocial assistance for victims b)  Empower  migrants  and  communities  to  denounce  any  acts  of  incitement  to  violence directed towards migrants by informing them of available mechanisms for redress, and ensure that those who actively participate in the commission of a hate crime targeting migrants are held accountable, in accordance with national legislation, while upholding international human rights law, in particular the right to freedom of expression c)  Promote independent, objective and quality reporting of media outlets, including internet-based  information,  including  by  sensitizing  and  educating  media  professionals  on migration-related  issues  and  terminology,  investing  in  ethical  reporting  standards  and advertising, and stopping allocation of public funding or material support to media outlets that  systematically  promote  intolerance,  xenophobia,  racism  and  other  forms  of discrimination towards migrants, in full respect for the freedom of the media 
25 d)  Establish mechanisms to prevent, detect and respond to racial, ethnic and religious profiling of  migrants  by  public  authorities,  as  well  as  systematic  instances  of  intolerance, xenophobia,  racism  and  all  other  multiple  and  intersecting  forms  of  discrimination  in partnership with National Human Rights Institutions, including by tracking and publishing trends analyses, and ensuring access to effective complaint and redress mechanisms e)  Provide  migrants,  especially  migrant  women,  with  access  to  national  and  regional complaint and redress mechanisms with a view to promoting accountability and addressing governmental actions related to discriminatory acts and manifestations carried out against migrants and their families f)   Promote  awareness-raising  campaigns  targeted  at  communities  of  origin,  transit  and destination in order to inform public perceptions regarding the positive contributions of safe, orderly and regular migration, based on evidence and facts, and to end racism, xenophobia and stigmatization against all migrants g)  Engage migrants, political, religious and community leaders, as well as educators and service providers to detect and prevent incidences of intolerance, racism, xenophobia, and other forms of discrimination against migrants and diasporas and support activities in local communities to promote mutual respect, including in the context of electoral campaigns

330 casualties if you look as far back as 1985.

And 3354 since the first civil nuclear plants were connected to the network of developped countries (1956).

Vs how many deaths in developped countries from nuclear plant incidents?

And for how many Terra-watts produced?

I mean, just compare the death toll of nuclear vs hydro since 1956 in France, Japan or the US.

The only country that had massive casualties from nuclear is USSR, and they also have more casualties from dam failures than from Cernobyl. Granted, the main incident is linked to a dam that was not used to produce electricity, but it still shows that these technologies do convey their own risks.

&gt; It's less ""dams are risky/deadly"" and more ""low safety/construction standards, bribery, shit maintenance, government not evacuating when they could/should have"".

Not saying hydro is bad. Hydro is good.

239,"I would say quite nice. Some tips if you do end up visiting:

Try to avoid the peak season (July- August mainly) if you plan to move around. It just gets crazy. 

Santorini has a pretty interesting history and some monuments thousands of years old. Read a bit about it on the trip and a visit to the excavation site would be on my to-do list. 

Santorinians have also been making wine for a very long time. Wine tours are quite nice, but if you do not want to spend the time visiting a winery on your own should be good. I would go to Santos winery only if the view is a must for you. Also if you do not take a tour of the winery (most wineries offer this as well) ask the staff for some info. The climate in Santorini is harsh and unforgiving and the locals devised ingenious ways to combat that. When tasting try to get some vinsanto as well. It is a desert wine, which most people are not fond of, but also quite unique and it is just a tasting.   

Food is pretty good on the island, i would ask the hotel reception-concierge for some recommendations. Make sure to mention that view does not matter to you (if you are staying somewhere with a view at least). Restaurants with a view tend to charge more as is expected. 

I would definitely avoid Fira, it tends to be crowded most of the time and most places are of lesser quality than the rest of the island. 

The same goes for ATVs and buggies. Rent an ATV through your reception as they will usually work with some more reputable companies. Its fun but has no AC, safety is minimal and you do not even get the perks of a bike. Bikes cost a ton less and allow you to avoid traffic and park almost anywhere. Cars offer AC and plenty of space for shopping, beach towels etc. Buggies are atrociously expensive and are the worst of all worlds. (Avoid driving anywhere during July and August). 

Make reservations on the same day of your arrival. Most hotel staff will be happy to help with that and it will allow for some peace of mind for the rest of your trip. 

Taxis and transfer services work based on fixed rates based on areas. Ask the hotel what the price for a taxi should be prior to reserving any transportation (which you should). Drivers ask more for people on the spot. MANY tourists are looking for taxis and there are only that many available. 

This last one goes for all of Greece but try Gyros (or souvlaki). It is the local street food and it is fulfilling cheap and by most accounts healthy.

I have had the luck to visit and work there and it is indeed an amazing place, vibrant and so unique and awe inspiring. 

PS. I know for most people it is a long trip so i would try to combine it with Meteora in Greece. Another place with natural beauty and interesting morphology. Of course Italy is right next door so for a longer vacation it is ideal. Positano is very similar, Florence is my favorite and i do not think i have to mention anything other than Venice's name. If you have already visited/ do not want to spend as much money/ do not like Italy(how can you NOT like Italy ?) then i would definitely recommend Croatia. It is an absolutely stunning place with extremely friendly people. Sadly i have not been there enough yet and cannot offer much advice on places there, but i would go out of my way to visit Plitvice lakes. It is further away than most areas of interest but it is just jaw dropping - ly beautiful. 

Sry for the long post, TL;DR: Its quite nice, has good food and wine and thousand of years worth of history. Combine it with Italy or Croatia for an extended vacation and have an amazing time.",,/r/europe/comments/bieive/beautiful_picture_taken_over_santorini_greece/em0pv7a/,thecreatorst,1556495493

245,"&gt; What are the main things you are expecting from Sanchez? Is him not straying too far from the center enough?

Basically. I didn't like the 22% increase in minimum wage. That's a recipe for hampering job creation, and Spain's biggest problem has always been high unemployment.

But again, my main reason for voting for him right now is the Catalan issue. I basically wanted to avoid a right-wing coalition that would have taken over the Catalan government and all but assured a fatal confrontation with Catalonia.

Ideally, I'd like PSOE and Podemos to make take a firm stand and say the following: the current state is unsustainable, we're willing to support reforming the Constitution to make Spain a true federal state. All regions (states) are equal, just like in Germany. All pay the same taxes, according to their population (individual income taxes and corporate taxes would still ensure that money from Catalonia flows in at a sustainable pace). BUT, we will only do this if the Catalan parties refuse to seek independence. We will not vote for this unless that happens. Put the separatists in a tough spot, show them you're for real and have a real offer, while still being committed to preserving Spain's unity.

&gt; Is your preffered coalition C's+PSOE?

Ideally, yes. But not with the current C's.

&gt; And finally, if C's goes back to the center, and moves away from Vox, would you consider voting for them?

Yes, if they go back from wanting to take over the Catalan government on day 1, which is not only counterproductive but also unjustified.",,/r/europe/comments/biamn4/spanish_election_megathread/em0q33m/,Booby_McTitties,1556495670

332,"&gt; No historical artefact has a higher value than the value of a human life. For example, should Prague be destroyed like Warsaw was, it would break my heart given the historical value the city has for our nation, but if I had to choose between losing Prague architecture and losing the elites of our nation, then bye bye Prague castle and Charles bridge. And I am sure the vast majority of Poles would see it the same way. No returned arts can ever compensate the human loss that Nazi Germany (and also Soviet Union) created in Poland. Apart from the Jews and Roma of course, you went directly after the Polish intelligence.

Agreed. 

&gt; Of course you can't bring those people back with money, but money obviously does play a huge role in rebuilding and creating the conditions for educating new elites of the nation.

Agreed. 

&gt; Of course by now it's too late. But it was a relevant problem for at least 3-4 decades after the war.

Agreed, but that was also the time where it was crucial not to burden Germany with those payments. It's also the time where the countries on the east of Germany had no chance to successfully claim anything from the federal republic due to the cold war divide.

&gt; And you are right that opening it now would likely mean opening a pandora box. So yes, better keep it close. That being said, don't pretend like you have the moral high ground in this issue. Your rejection of these claims is motivated entirely by self-interest, no matter how much Germans will love to grandstand how they actually have an outstanding record in taking responsibility.

Where did I even suggest having the moral highground here? I merely stated that there are moral arguments in favour of the current generation not paying, I never claimed any kind of highground (apart from the legal highground of course). 

&gt; You know if the German generations that actually were responsible paid the reparations to countries they destroyed back when it was a relevant issue, we would not have to have this conversation, where the biggest argument for not paying basically is 'well, it happened a long time ago'.

We would not have the discussion, but it is uncertain whether we would see a prosperous, peaceful europe like we do today. 

&gt; Basically what you are saying is that your ancestors successfuly avoided doing what was right, so that's why you should not have to pay.

""Avoided"" is the wrong word as them not paying was negotiated and agreed upon by the international community of affected nations. 

&gt; On the top of that you are actually the good guys here, because you said sorry?

Never claimed that either. I simply consider our approach of dealing with history superior to the approach of countries trying to white-wash their history. 

&gt; Honesty would simply be much better - just saying - no, we don't want to pay, because it would be a huge financial burden on us and yes, our ancestors also did not have to pay remotely as much as would be appropriate to what they did and that sucks, but this is just what the world is like, it's not a fair place.

Once more, even paying a couple of millions would not be tolerable because of the pandoras-box-argument above. The amount isn't the main relevant factor, it's just on top of that. Additionally: What would this stance actually change? I do not see anyone going ""Oh, you are not paying because its too much money. Gotcha, nevermind then!"". We have also been quite clear, everytime Germany has rejected these claims, we did not claim some kind of moral highground, we simply referred to it being legally settled. 

&gt; 
What dou you mean for example? Every single person has no choice in where they get born. A baby born in Niger did not choose to be born in some poor Sahel village. The baby is not responsible for the shitty economic situation that the country is in. You complain you do not want face the consequences that your ancestors created, because it's not fair. But millions of people have the face the consequences of their ancestors failing to create good living conditions for them. Happens all the time.

348,"&gt; To be fair nuclear energy is, despite its shortcomings, the lesser evil of electricity production.

Probably is, and definitely is in terms of climate change, but that's beside the point. Germany and France have been heading in pretty different trajectories concerning nuclear power since the 80s. France should keep their nuclear plants for now and replace them with renewables step by step, while Germany needs to get out of coal quickly, strongly extend renewables, and supplement them with gas as much as necessary, ideally with an increasing share of it being sourced through power-to-gas on windy and sunny days.

&gt; The problem is : electricity production is on the margin of our issues. The amount of energy we use outside of electricity is a much bigger, much less easily solvable problem.

508,"The map shows how many people moved in or out of a given Italian province in 2017 (the most recent year available). International immigration or emigration are excluded. 

Other than the usual expected north-south difference, a few trends are notable:

\- after the recession in 2007, the German-speaking province of Bolzano became a top destination for internal migrants, while immigration towards this province was previously relatively low, or even negative in some years.

\- the central regions of Abruzzo, Umbria and Marche are now losing inhabitants to the rest of Italy, while before the net migration was strongly positive (especially in Umbria/Marche)

\- the migratory balance in the large norther cities (Milan and Turin) has been positive for the past 6-7 years, which is surprising for Milan especially, since as recently as 2007 it was losing as many inhabitants as Naples(relative to its population).

\- nothing much changed for the other big cities - net migration to Rome continues to be positive as ever, and Naples still has a deeply negative balance.

\- three Lombard provinces saw large falls in net migration - Lodi, Pavia and Cremona went from strong net migration ten years ago to barely positive now. 

\- overall, people are no more likely to move to other places in Italy than they were before the recession. We might have expected people to be more mobile as unemployment increases, but save a few regions (such as Molise) - this isn't really the case. Either they stay where they are, or they move abroad, but there's no great surge of people moving to northern cities to find work.

609,"Ach Berlin. Was ist Berlin? Berlin ist die Stadt für die man sich als Deutscher auf internationaler Bühne schämen muss. Wenn man Berlin mit anderen europäischen Hauptstädten wie London, Paris, Madrid und Amsterdam vergleicht, treibt es jedem anständigen Menschen die Schamesröte ins Gesicht. Selbst kleine Länder wie Österreich, Belgien oder die Schweiz haben mit Wien, Brüssel und Zürich international vorzeigbare Städte mit hoher Lebensqualität. Deutschland ist gestraft mit Berlin, der Hauptstadt der Versager. Berlin beheimatet mit Abstand am meisten Arschlöcher in der gesamten Republik. Deutsche Bahn, Bundestag, Air Berlin und der Axel Springer Verlag sind nur einige Beispiele für den unfähigen Abschaum der hier beherbergt wird. Glorreiche Zeit sind schon längst vorbei, diese Stadt liegt am Boden. Der Berliner an sich ist durch und durch ein fauler Lump. Charaktereigenschaften die in jedem zivilisierten Kulturkreis als pure Faulheit, Unfreundlichkeit, Unfähigkeit, dissoziale Persönlichkeitsstörung und Dummheit gelten, erklärt der Berliner kurzerhand zur Berliner Wesensart. Ein weiteres zentrales Merkmal ist der alles beherrschende Minderwertigkeitskomplex. Deswegen projiziert der Berliner auf jeden der in irgendeiner Weise besser ist als er, massive Hassgefühle. Besonders die ihm in allen Belangen haushoch überlegenen Süddeutschen sind ihm ein Dorn im Auge. Er neidet ihnen den Erfolg und München steht ganz oben auf seiner Hassliste. Diese Stadt ist alles und hat alles was der Berliner gerne wäre und hätte. Das München dem Berliner sein Lotterleben finanziert, interessiert den Berliner nicht, er glaubt sogar insgeheim er hätte es verdient. Anstatt sich aus seiner aus Neid und Missgunst entstehenden Lethargie zu befreien und seine Stadt umzukrempeln, ergeht er sich in asozialen Schmarotzertum und hält noch große Stücke auf seine vermeintliche Weltstadt. Kulturell ist Berliner eher schwach veranlagt, große Werke liegen lang zurück. Auch gilt hier bereits das Aussprechen des Buchstaben ""g"" als ""j"" als große Kulturleistung. Fortgeschrittene beherrschen sogar das Anhängen eines ""wa?"" an den Ende eines jeden Satzes. Das Leistungsniveau in der Küche bewegt sich auf überschaubarem Niveau. Eine Wurst aus gemahlenem Seperatorenfleisch mit Ketchup und Currygewürz wird hier als Currywurst und als kulinarischer Geniestreich verkauft. Jeder vernünftig denkende Mensch hält eine Wurst mit Ketchup wohl kaum für den heiligen Gral der Küchenkunst und wahrscheinlich noch nicht einmal für ein Rezept. Großzügig lässt der Rest der Republik den Berliner in diesem Glauben um seine Minderwertigkeitskomplexe nicht überhand nehmen zu lassen. Wirtschaftlich ist Berlin ein einziges Desaster, selbst die späte DDR stand solider da. Ansonsten fußt die Berliner Wirtschaft auf alternativen Blogs, irgendwas mit Medien und Genderstudies wenn man den Universitäten glauben darf. Ungeachtet des wirtschaftlichen Bankrottes leistet sich der Berliner trotzdem Prestigeprojekte wie das Stadtschloss und einen Flughafen der mangels Funktionstüchtigkeit als Kunstprojekt gelten soll. Ebenso beherbergt diese Stadt sämtliche Zentralen der Volksparteien, die aus Marketinggründen auf das ""Verräter"" im Namen verzichten. Bürgermeister dieser Stadt war lange der lustige Wowibär der mit seiner Prestige&amp;Prosecco Politik alles in den Abgrund riss, was noch halbwegs präsentabel war. Kurzum: Berlin ist der Fliesentisch Deutschlands. Es ist das für Deutschland, was Griechenland für die Europäische Union ist und hätte Berlin eine offene Kloake, wäre es das Rumänien Deutschlands. Berlin ist ein Schandfleck, der Pickel am Arsche Deutschlands. Berlin ist der Typ der ohne Einladung auf deine Party kommt, noch nicht mal Alkohol mitbringt und auch nicht versteht dass er nicht erwünscht ist wenn man ihm ein paar Zähne aus dem Gesicht klopft und die Treppe runterwirft. Berlin ist das Detroit Deutschlands und gehört für 200 рубль an Russland verkauft.",Lithuania,/r/europe/comments/bi8zox/russiasponsored_breakaways_from_eastern_european/elzkly6/,fjellhus,1556466078

Then you add eggs and sugar, vanilla sugar, and then more sugar and flour. You mix this into a batter/dough.  You then fold in candied fruits that have been soaked in alcohol, usually coniac, and finally room temperature butter. You then put it in the oven on a very low heat (30-40°C) with a bowl of water to allow it to rise for between an hour and three hours. 

You then take out the bowl of water, increase the temperature to 180°C and bake for 45 minutes. 

You then let it completely cool and then ice the cakes with a mix of icing sugar and egg whites, and whisk until creamy, but not until it starts to stiffen as this will turn into Meringue. You then spread this on top and decorate and leave for a further 4 hours for the icing to harden!

788,"Like you said it is keeping the 100% tariffs on Serbia and considering both the US and the EU have lobbied for the opposite this is no small feat. Even more so because the EU is leveraging the carrot of EU membership to get Kosovo to back down and still Kosovo refuses. Otherwise there have not been many situations in which to observe whether Kosovo does what it's told because it's interests usually coincide with whatever Europe and the US prefer in the region.    

Still I can't imagine that if Kosovo decided to turn towards Russia the West would forcibly stop it. It doesn't do so with Russia sympathetic EU nations let alone the more unaligned  Kosovo. Neither did it punish Turkey when it bought Russian weapons and for generally being anti-Western in recent times.   

Contrast that to Russia who demands its neighbours cut off close ties to the West and invaded Ukraine for so much as daring to turn its nose to the West. Moldova suffered too as their EU association agreement was met with strict Russian sanctions on Moldovan agriculture. That hurts them a lot as agriculture is a lot more important in Moldova than is typical.    

Surely if this is  the treatment the actually independent Russian neighbours get, then South Ossetia, Transnistria, etc. are kept on a much tighter leash.    

Another indicator of their subservience to Russia is that they're all using the Russian ruble. You could retort that Kosovo is using the euro, but I think that's not as damning. Firstly because if anyone is pulling Kosovo's strings it would be the US, not the EU and the US uses dollars. Secondly because with the dollar and the euro being the world's biggest currencies it makes some sense to adopt them. Zimbabwe and Montenegro do for example and they are unquestionably sovereign. The ruble is not only much less relevant but it's also a volatile currency so adopting it would make it more difficult to trade with the part of the world that's not Russia. The constant inflation can't be nice either.      

Another point is that unlike Kosovo these regions receive massive state aid from Moscow, as if they're part of Russia. We've all heard of Crimea, [in this article](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2018/10/10/the-independent-republic-where-everything-depends-on-moscow) I found the sum for South Ossetia. $88.4 million which may sound small but considering SO's tiny population it's actually times higher than  what Bulgaria receives as an EU state, which is itself  much higher than what Kosovo receives. We should also take into account that the West is much richer than Russia so it could still be natural if it matched Russia's contributions. But it doesn't even though it has much more dough to throw around and engages in more charity as a  share of GDP.   That suggests that  these regions are more intimately linked to Russia than Kosovo is to the West.

Lastly the article mentions another curiosity about South Ossetia's elections:  

&gt;In 2011, voters unexpectedly rejected the presidential candidate supported by Moscow and elected the opposition politician Alla Dzhioyeva. The ruling Unity Party complained of violations and took the matter to South Ossetia’s Supreme Court, which promptly invalidated the election results. Later, Leonid Tibilov became president, a position he held until 2017, when he was replaced by Anatoly Bibilov — the same pro-Kremlin candidate who lost to Dzhioyeva six years earlier.   

I'm sure there's much more to be said about this whole topic. Even this small part though points to Kosovo being much more independent from the West than these territories are from Russia.  

&gt;They're certainly not as independent as a proper independent country should be.

A Soviet street is still a European one. You can find shitty streets in every country.

&gt;How can country without human rights in 21 century can be European?

Simple, because human rights don't define Europe. Europe is mainly a geographic and historical unit, and Russia fully fits into it. Even culturally, Russians are still Slavs and their culture is Slavic, which is European.

&gt;Yes, and 3% of Turkey is in Europe. Let it be European!

For Russia it's a lot more than 3%. Also, the wast majority of the population is in Europe. As is the capital. And, most importantly, Russia originate in Europe. I mean, they're Slavs. They didn't move from Siberia into Europe but from Europe into Siberia. And speaking of Siberia, it's a colony, a remnant of the empire that was never lost. If Russia today is Asian on the basis of most of it's land being in Asia than Spain was for a long time a South American country. France an African one, the UK a North American one and latter possibly African one (not sure if their African holdings came to exceed Canada's size at some point).

980,"&gt; Lenin turned around in the issue of ""workerism"" quite early during the NEP, admitting they need to rely on the old Tsarist intelligentsia to run things smoothly because many Russian workers couldn't even read. However, after the massive literacy campaigns (Eastern European countries almost always score close to 100% in terms of literacy) this was obviously no longer the case. They produced nobel-price winning scientists and went to space, so obviously that's another crude misrepresentation.



They killed most of the intelligentzia, all the ruling parties were full of peasants who didn't know what to do. There was some education but it was mainly around the capitals the rest was shit



&gt;Another lie. The USSR regularly criticized the US and other Western countries for engaging in protectionist trading policies. There is a book called Bad Samaritans from the South Korean economist Ha-Joon Chang that analyses that. The USSR had also encouraged Honecker in East Germany to set up production facilities for Western companies like Ikea.


Absolute truth, USSR also barred Easterners traveling to the West in fear of mass immigration towards functioning countries



&gt;Only Romania was because they took out IMF loans, but they dislodged themselves from the USSR politically before. East Germany had trouble paying loan rates back but they weren't bankrupt.


Every country was bankrupt, that's why all were so miserable after 1989 when Russians stopped giving money to the rest of the satellites.


&gt;How is growth ""not real""? That they traded oil and gas, correct, so does the USA, does that make the growth of countries that buy fossil fuels from the US ""not real""? Clearly the growth was designed to be intrinsic, they built streets, industry, schools, hospitals, houses, etc.


Because it's a spiral to the bottom, USA sells oil but also has a working economy


&gt;That's not why the USSR dissolved. Here is a good video that talks about the dissolution of the USSR:


That's exactly why it was dissolved


&gt;Bullshit. Payment was measured in-kind depending on your output. This is actually more meritocratic than the model of being paid a guaranteed monthly wage. David Graeber's book Bullshit Jobs portrays this quite well.

True. How many representatives does each country get, and how are they chosen? 

&gt;Brexit is a good thing for Britain.

""Lie"" is not a sufficient rebuttal.  It's an opinion, and as such can't be true or false. Whether or not you agree is obviously going to be dictated by whether or not you think the EU project is a success, and you obviously do. I think all the countries other than Germany, and even then, many Germans, would disagree. 

&gt;it's going to result in a hard brexit

Here you seemed to realize that opinions and predictions can't be true or false. I guess you were learning as you were going. 

&gt;The EU is collapsing.

Haha. You seem to think the EU is doing great so you would think this is false. 

&gt;It's not sustainable

Self evidently true. Ask Greece. Or Macron. Or Spain. Or one of the more eastern countries. It's going so, so well for them. 

&gt;Hopefully never comes to pass, but if it does it will be because of the right, so 50% lie

BECAUSE OF THE RIGHT HAHAHAHAHA

So unbelievably unaware. Which 'side,' generally, are driving power out of member governments and into the EU government? Which side lied repeatedly about plans to build an EU army and are acting now like they never commented on it?

Who will decide where money paid to the EU will go, and how much of that will be spent on an army that could tacitly threaten states who, in the future, decide to leave?

He said CitizenGo would not channel money to Vox itself but “you could give to any foundation that doesn’t mind to give, to forward the money, to Vox... that would be a good option”.  
“This is something we haven’t made public”, Arsuaga continued, “but, in Spain, we’re going to launch a campaign before the general elections... where we are going to show bad things that have been said” by the leaders of parties that Vox is running against, for example “in favour of abortion or in favour of LGBT laws” – describing since-released posters and adverts against candidates from other parties.",,/r/europe/comments/bhtj1y/a_trumplinked_super_pac_is_trying_to_push_europes/elyw5nh/,PauperGoldGiver,1556438620

1100,"&gt;A monarch on the other hand provides continuity. His or her interests are inherently connected to the country's, and it would be in their interest to command respect and represent the country the best they can without embarrassing themselves and us.

I assume you don't know about the King of Thailand or the King of Spain and their scandals, or the media blackout regarding the royal family in the UK after the queen Diana's death climaxed a series of sex scandals. This is fantasy land you're describing.

  
\&gt; Furthermore, if we could adopt the UK  model they could also be apolitical instead of being a party puppet and  trained from childhood in the skills of diplomacy, etiquette and general  behaviour that commands respect. If we had a good monarch then even  with Orbán we wouldn't have the shit PR we have abroad.

&amp;#x200B;

The UK where the Black Spider Memos scandal came from?  Do you also think that Kings magically cures measels as well as bad PR? Do you really think the rest of the world is so stupid to be distracted by some extra poshery in an authoritarian regime? Maybe they can also guess lotery numbers and make bad dreams go away?  


\&gt; Finally, a marginal benefit is that a monarch can generate positive media attention and tourism which can bring in extra income.  


Monarchs don't generate extra tourism. The two countries with the most tourism income in Europe violently overthrew their monarchs, and their residences became open to the public and those actually generate extra tourism. Do you think there's American's lining up to catch a glimpse of the King of Sweden over his security guard over visiting an actual open palace that doesn't require a security clearence to enter?

As a result, the UK publics views the EU transactionally ""how much do we pay and how much money do we get in return"", very few people are invested in the principles, political models and values that form the basis of the EU. Therein the problem.

This particular moment in history is extremely bad for Brexit, because EU members are facing strong imperial wishes to break up the EU into smaller chunks and rule them. This is what Britain has done historical e.g. to India and we are faced with America 1st, China 1st, Russia 1st which all have similar agendas, albeit with a very different approach. The EU just cannot afford, at this stage of the game, to deal with a divided society like the UK looking for purely transactional benefits. A strategic approach is needed, not a transactional approach. The EU needs to strengthen its core, possibly even shed the periphery if its members are not to become parts of a Russian empire, US vassal states or Chinese economic colonies.

A Britain that sees the EU as a strategic necessity is this age is more than welcome in the EU.

Due to the Iranian Revolution, local Saudi extremists became emboldened and were hoping to achieve a similar revolution in Saudi Arabia, so they took over the Masjid Al Haram, the holiest mosque there. They wanted the removal of the Saud regime and replacing it with full Islamic Sharia rule.

Fearing that the extremists will get more political powers and public approval now that people have seen the ""success"" of the revolution in Iran, the Sauds made a deal with the extremist so that instead of letting them go 100 they met then half way at 50. They implemented some of the demands from the extremists, so the Sauds were seen as more aligned with Islam and the extremists lost some political capital from the people who were willing go with this half-way measures. This way, the Sauds ensured their remaining in power and protected their political and economical interests.

That's just the way KGB lawyers think, and Putin is a prime example of a KGB lawyer.

As to fascism, if you read the Wikipedia description, it fits Putin's regime very closely:

*Fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete and regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties. Such a state is led by a strong leader—such as a dictator and a martial government composed of the members of the governing fascist party—to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society. Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature and views political violence, war, and imperialism as means that can achieve national rejuvenation. Fascists advocate a mixed economy, with the principal goal of achieving autarky (national economic self-sufficiency) through protectionist and interventionist economic policies.*

Typical for fascism is the strong leader, healing national wounds by attacking neighbours and no reluctance to engage in violence. All these are present in Putin's Russia, that is why it is a fascist regime.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bhymno/putin_says_russia_may_offer_fasttracked_passports/elyq5qu/,trisul-108,1556429916

Russia doesn't want to deal with the consequences of fully annexing Ukraine and doesn't get them all that much, but keeping a war going and intentionally making the annexation of Crimea illegitimate (a negotiated referendum probably would have had the same result) keeps Ukraine in a precarious position and prevents them from getting too close to the EU and, more importantly, NATO. The EU has shown it will accept countries with territorial disputes (Cyprus) but would still be a lot more hesitant to accept an active warzone and NATO wouldn't touch it because of what Russia did.

1380,"I may have overreacted; it really did sound like you were essentially condemning the man for going into a community and helping out ""on the front lines"", presumably an area where the government has neglected to support the youth.

Your expanded explanation of your intent makes me withdraw my harsh condemnation of your person and want to apologize, though I will still disagree on the assessment of the waste of potential you are seeing here:

Yeah, computers or even smartphones may become cheaper all the time, but that still doesn't make them affordable for everyone, not to mention the monthly cost of internet access. Electronic communication *has* almost become a fundamental right of the modern citizen, but I still think all of us are privileged that we can waste hours arguing on social media.

I'm not a citizen there, so a native should correct me if I'm wrong, but Portugal in particular seems to have a significant gap between the rich and the poor, with a lot of families living in cramped shacks and half-decayed houses, with many kids being sent to work or beg on streets.

But even assuming for a moment that these kids may scrounge up the cash to buy a computer, or get one gifted by better-off relatives, you actually raise a good point when you mention lack of interest. Even if you put a video on YouTube, what good does it do if people don't actually go there to watch it? If you were a teenager from some impoverished neighborhood and someone gave you a PC with internet access, would you really start looking up mathematics videos all by yourself? I think it needs someone to get them engaged, get them started. Someone who actively goes around to talk to the parents and gets them to send their kids to these free classes, where *maybe* he can get some of them interested and perhaps even inspired.

A decade or so ago I would've said he should get a TV show like Bill Nye, but nowadays I don't think even that would be a successful model for engaging the kids. Young people today just don't grow up perusing media the same way we did when we were kids. Today, *if* you are online, you've got the entire world at your fingertips -- so what could make someone seek out a video on mathematics, not even knowing it's gonna be fun?",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bhtqbi/died_a_hero/elyfs83/,akashisenpai,1556419423

In Germany, they banned planning permission for homes more than 500 meters outside of urban areas because they overstretch infrastructure as it's very expensive to provide services to one-off housing. The Germans had the foresight to realise this, but stupid, old Paddyland didn't and now 500,000 homes can't get high-speed broadband. 

Broadband speeds over copper lines deteriorate with distance - the longer your lines, the slower your speeds. It's very expensive to bring high-speed broadband to one-off houses and that's why we're lagging behind Germany. Broadband in most parts of urban Ireland is very good, I'm only on 50Mb, but my brother has 1000Mb and my sister can get 500Mb - we all live in the same town.

If Fianna Fail didn't allow people to build a ridiculous number of one-off houses since the 1970s, there wouldn't any issues, but now the government is planning on taking €3 billion of Dublin's tax money and using it to rollout fibre optic broadband to people who built cheap homes in the countryside.

And this is exactly what happened here. The polls were right as to the overall popular vote (Clinton won some three million more votes in total), but they were comically wrong because of cascade of ""margins of errors"" in Trumps favour (""propagation of error"").",Charlemagnia,/r/europe/comments/bi3bze/public_thinks_eu_referendum_was_bad_idea_says/ely3hb9/,ColourFox,1556408915

1624,"&gt; the rights of heterosexual couples who them explicitly in the aims of building families

Only some legal benefits to marriage are concerned with procreation, and frankly they should be just available to any couple raising children, because the children are the ones who these laws are supposed to benefit and protect in the first place.

The most controversial part is probably adoption rights. I haven't heard of any research that gives solid foundations to claim that children raised by homosexual couples or individuals are negatively affected in their development because of their parents' sexuality. But that's just me. I also think that people living alone should have at least a chance to adopt a kid. Single parents aren't a rarity, and while having two parents is obviously better, having only one is still better than living in an orphanage.

The rest is very convenient, sometimes even essential to any couple living together. Restricting these benefits to heterosexual couples doesn't make any sense. A non-normative couple is just as valid and good of a family as a family of a man and a woman.

&gt;If we don't use Cold War era terms, why should we use 19th century terms then? Central Europe nowadays as a term makes no sense. 

Central Europe is not a 19th century term, you’re thinking of Mitteleuropa. Central European countries today are those that were part of Mitteleuropa in the 19th century and prior and the grouping makes plenty of sense, you’re just basing everything off on semantics rather than actual arguments. Being under communism for half a century does not undo 1000+ years of common history . 


&gt;Poland has more in common with Bulgaria economically, politically and socially speaking nowadays than it does with Germany

That is absolutely and objectively false. Poland barely has any ties with Bulgaria, the only similarities they share is speaking a Slavic language. Other than that their faiths are different, their political systems are different, their mentalities are different, etc. Poles definitely share more in common with Germany than with Bulgaria, for example Western Christian faith and Magdeberg Rights are just a few examples.

&gt;Religion doesn't play any role in 2019, let's be honest with ourselves. 

Except it does? Poland is still very pious, unlike countries in Western Europe who have became secular or countries in Eastern Europe who have became secular due to communism. Poland still kept its faith and traditions, like Hungary.

&gt;You are mad people still use a terminology that was based on the outcome of WW2, but you suggest we keep using another one that is coined depending on religious affiliation that stopped playing a vital role in Europe like 2 centuries ago.

Again, 45 years of communism does not undo 1000+ years of history. Poland was always considered either Central European, or Western European. Eastern European as a grouping for Poland (and Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary) only came about after these countries became communist due to the Soviet Union.",,/r/europe/comments/bhv9pa/0542_in_warsaw/elxavqx/,Tecnoteri,1556387289

But the central government eventually gets fed up trying to figure out what to do with the new town, and just redirects the entire road, so the town is suddenly stranded in the middle of nowhere with no road connection, and so they're cut off from the rest of society, and are all much happier in their little traffic-free town.","Norwegian, living in UK",/r/europe/comments/bhxgix/getting_your_boat_into_the_amsterdam_canals_on/elxb2to/,rubygeek,1556387439

There is no solution to tax harmonisation that does not negatively impact the periphery.

&amp;#x200B;

This can be in terms of agriculture (for instance France and Poland benefit far far more than the UK or Germany from CAP due to the state of agriculture in those countries), medical care (countries with larger and older populations require more medical services) and natural resources (like Scotland and Norway benefit much more from investment in shale and oil extraction than Ireland does).

I’m not denying they do not have anything in common, but to deny that Poles do not share anything with Germans is false and ridiculous since the two nations have been bordering each other for well over a thousand years and it’s only natural that they have and share things in common.

Poland has no ties with Bulgaria nowadays? Hm I think a Pole and a Bulgarian might find they face similar struggles, while a German might not share the same opinion. The truth is communism left a much more important mark on both countries than whatever happened in the 15th century did.

1878,"&gt;Insane things can happen when you incorporate any religious doctrine into a state's law.

Yes. Usually tyranny, misery and death. 

I grew up in a Marxist country. It works even if there is no""god"".  Religious mindset is a framework of cognition that circumvents critical thinking and dissent.

&gt;any religious ideology including Christianity can be said to have an inextricable political dimension.

Not necessarily. But there were attempts to create a theocracy based on literal interpretations of the Bible. Protestants and their stake burnings were a good example.

Catholicism never got that far because it was already locked into a battle between spiritual and civic authority and it was never resolved. In many ways you can argue that it led to the creation of modern western civilization because there was always some space for dissent - since you could choose to support either the pope or the emperor.

&gt;Would you call the Pope a necessary part of Christian faith? Plenty of Christians would tell you that the political machinery that evolved from the religion, in this case the Catholic Church, is entirely separable from Christianity as a spiritual doctrine. This is what Protestantism was based on. So can the same not be said for Islam - that a Muslim can practice their faith without endorsing politics done in the name of their religion?

No. Pope is not necessary at all. Having an universal church has its advantages. Most protestants never truly reformed anything. Plenty of protestants turned into literal fundamentalists which was *worse* than catholics. Very few protestants actually improved on the christian mainstream and mostly by abandoning the Bible that was **catholic** to begin with.

It's a funny thing that protestants thought that literal intepretation of the book that was manufactured by catholics as the basis of their doctrine would help them....

This is why I say that Protestantism wasn't a religious revolution but a political one. Very few protestants actually focused on religion. Once you see the conflict between Catholicism and Protestantism in terms of the current culture war (Conservatives vs Progressives) it will make more sense. In the end the true ""protestants"" are the people who stay away from it.

The problem with Islam is that if you read the Koran - and I am assuming you havent - it says right in the text that it's the ultimate source of truth and that political structure enforcing Islamic supremacy is necessary.

You won't find it in the Bible even though the Bible as we know it was created  after Christianity became the official state religion.

So there... this is why Islam sucks more than Christianity and why anyone who says otherwise is a hateful anti-Christian moron and not a rational thinker.",,/r/europe/comments/bhplua/official_german_report_acknowledges_islamist/elx1o03/,vzenov,1556380482

&gt;After a series of serious Austrian defeats in 1849, the Austrian Empire came close to the brink of collapse. Thus, the new young emperor Franz Joseph I had to call for Russian help in the name of the Holy Alliance.[3] Tsar Nicholas I answered, and sent a 200,000 strong army with 80,000 auxiliary forces. Finally, the joint army of Russian and Austrian forces defeated the Hungarian forces.

&gt; Poland has struck a €380m deal with Italian defence group Leonardo for the delivery of four AW101 helicopters, in the latest indication of Warsaw’s determination to bolster its military capabilities.

&gt; Poland, the linchpin of Nato’s eastern flank, is one of only five of the bloc’s members that meet its target of spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence, and its efforts to ramp up its military capabilities have taken on added urgency since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.

&gt; The helicopters, which can be used for anti-submarine warfare and combat search and rescue missions, are expected to be ready by 2022. Leonardo said that the aircraft would be delivered by its Polish unit PZL-Swidzik, located just outside  Lublin in the east of the country.

&gt; Speaking at a ceremony in Swidnik, Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, hailed the deal and said that the helicopters would “significantly increase our defensive capabilities”.

&gt; “These are helicopters that will form a very important part of our security architecture, helicopters that have been tested by the navies of many countries, including the UK,” he said. “I would also like to express my pleasure that some of the production will take place here [in Poland].”

&gt; Leonardo said that alongside the deal, which also includes training and logistics components, it would set up a new legal entity headquartered in Warsaw. Chief executive Alessandro Profumo said that the deal was a “key step” in Leonardo’s relationship with the Polish Ministry of Defence and that the group was “committed to further growth and collaborations in Poland”.",South Macedonia,/r/europe/comments/bhz63m/poland_signs_380m_defence_deal_with_italys/elwsbin/,miauracjusz,1556372585

1924,"Don't put words in my mouth, especially when you don't know the backstory. Ireland endured 20 years of multiple governments dithering on legislating for [the X case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_v._X), and it only happened in 2013 due to the combined pressure of an ECHR ruling and public outrage after the death of Savita Halappanavar. 20 years of our government and our parliament refusing to bring our laws in line with our constitution. And that was the bare minimum of what was needed, only legislating to allow terminations when the woman's life was at risk. *20 fucking years*.

Pressure had built up over those two decades for further reform, and in the run up to the 2016 election the two main parties came under pressure to declare their position on abortion reform. The citizens assembly was proposed by FG, and it was widely seen by the public, by pundits, and by other politicians as a can kicking exercise, a way for that party to avoid having to define their own position on abortion for that election campaign. That is why I was cynical about the assembly, not because I didn't want the public to have their say. Quite the contrary, I was itching to hold the referendum as soon as possible, and the assembly appeared to be yet another attempt by government to delay reform of our abortion laws.

I still think that's all the assembly was supposed to be. The government were expecting it to come back with some moderate proposal to allow abortion in cases of rape and fatal foetal abnormalities, then they could dither some more and maybe put off the issue until after the next election when someone else might be in power. When the assembly voted in favour of abortion on request, a much more liberal position than the government were expecting, it completely blew up their strategy. The evidence presented at the assembly and subsequent parliamentary committee created a pressure that forced the government to hold a referendum.

So I see now the value of the assembly and believe they should be a permanent fixture of our democracy. But I'm still cynical about why FG chose to set one up, and that they might not have done so if they had known in advance how successful it was going to be.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/bhnehh/belgiums_germanspeaking_government_will_hand_some/elwsjxp/,TheGodBen,1556372798

- The 20-odd year old testing out their speed machine they've been tinkering on for months and are now driving a ludicrous speeds. (Bonus points if it's a superbike without any lights that sounds like the planet is ripping apart - that's me). They're probably on their way towards the Nürnburgring or they're just bouncing off the revlimiter in top gear for the sake of it.

- The balding yuppie father of 2 and his bitching wife in his lease car (preferably an Audi or Volvo estate with a coffin on the roof) who vary their speeds between ludicrous and caravan-mode based on their heart's contempt. This guy doesn't use his blinkers and road markings are for peasants, or so he says. Oh and this guy tailgates. A LOT. 

- Some young Dutch students in their shitbox car they bought for less than 600 euros and are now nursing through some cheap cross-continental trip.

2063,"&gt;First has been a thing because Bulgaria demanded border to be opened. Last happened since Turkey let them in via opening the border. Although, Turkey allowed Bulgarian Muslims in, if they came via other ways, meaning illegally crossing the border.

In every case Turkey demanded the border be opened as well.

&gt;Turkey having an influence in Bulgaria during the Cold War was pretty much a Bulgarian paranoia. Turkey didn't want to see Bulgarian Muslims (not just Bulgarian Turks) to be reduced of course, but also haven't had resources to take them in either.

You mean that Turkey, a cold war opponent of Bulgaria, would not use the Turkish minority to influence their neighbor? I have little love for the Turkish government, but I don't think I've ever insulted them as much as your claim of their utter incompetence insults them. In reality Turkish influence operations inside Bulgaria were ample and well documented, including recruiting of spies, incitement of the Turks against the Bulgarian minority and of course manipulating them with frequent changes to their policy of allowing or disallowing immigration.

As for not wanting Turkish immigration, this is also false. Turkey almost always either needed immigrants to fill up land from various expelled minorities or at least as loyal settlers to control those minorities better. Many of the 1989 immigrants were sent to Northern Cyprus and there were also attempts to settle them in the Kurdish regions.

&gt;During and **after the the wars**.

Not really. There weren't even reprisals against the Muslims of Western Thrace who had been complicit in massacres against Bulgarians.

&gt;That sounds like some urban myth to me. Ottoman Empire called Muslims into the empire in order to resettle them in certain regions including Balkans, but no-one called them all, but Ottomans preferred Balkan Muslims to stay where they are. 

The Ottoman religious authorities decreed that Muslims should be living in Muslim lands. And at the time the Ottomans needed more Muslims to secure their remaining holdings.

&gt;Nope. You even said it yourself in the beginning of your comment mate. Turkey didn't want Bulgarian Muslims to leave, and allowed them in masses when it opened its borders, due to the requests of then Bulgarian regime. Turkey even announced it can't take such large numbers for several times and closed its borders...

When the border was closed by the Bulgarian authorities (as it was for nearly all Bulgarian citizens, by the way) Turkey always demanded that the border be opened and that all Bulgarian Turks could find a home in Turkey. When it was actually opened, Turkey always closed the border sooner or later, for reasons I explained already.

&gt;And they wanted to decrease the numbers of Pomaks and Bulgarian Turks via that. How generous of them. They openly said they're afraid of their numbers and something should be done, meant first forced assimilation, and after that letting them leave/flee in mass once again. 

Still not the same as wanting to expel them. And even when the border was opened in 1989, the Bulgarian government didn't want an exodus on the scale that happened. The Bulgarian government was in fact calling on those who left to return.

&gt;Turks and Pomaks had been. Now in many of those areas, they're not.

This is not the point. You were claiming that the very fact of Muslims being the majority in some regions was alarming to the Bulgarian government when that clearly wasn't the case.

&gt;Aside from times it had been encouraged you mean? 

Except for during the wars and for a short time in 1950 and 1989, I can't really think of any such occasion. 

&gt;Funny how their numbers haven't increased as they should. Maybe it has to do with hundreds of thousands of them has been fleeing to Turkey every decade until the '90s. And no, their numbers have decrease through time so that isn't correct. Although then Bulgarian authorities in '80s were saying they can be a million given a period of time, so their numbers should be decreased for not allowing this dangerous outcome. 

There were about 930 thousand Muslims in 1946 and about 1.11 million in 1992 (so after about 200 thousand emigrated). It's fairly likely that despite the emigration wave in the 1950s, they exceeded a million by the 1960s at the latest. Seems quite a good population growth for the Bulgarian government being supposedly so eager to get rid of them.
Anyway, it was the Turks, not the Bulgarian Muslims who were supposedly almost a million by the 1980s.


&gt;They were around half a million in 2011. Not sure what their numbers are now, but that was the last census.

The last census greatly underestimates the number of all religious group since a very large number of people refused to answer the question on religion.

&gt;Their percentages also always decreased, which is the main issue here. Of course, even with them fleeing in mass, at least hundreds of thousands of them managed to be present in then growing Bulgaria. 

The Muslim population was 13.3% of the population in 1946 and 13.1% in 1992. Not nearly as significant as you're claiming.

&gt;True, at some point, Bulgaria chosen to assimilate Turks and Pomaks by force, rather than policies varying between oppression and denial, aside from times they've been literally cleansed. Great for her...

The tensions and loss of confidence that will inevitably result from losing the UK (and its international influence and budget contributions) will further complicate the EU's other problems (border control, non-mutually beneficial EU-wide economic and monetary policies, diverging foreign policies, low economic growth), which threaten to make EU membership less beneficial to member states, ultimately making other exits more likely in the next 15 - 20 years. 

Because remainers and others have fear-mongered and exaggerated about Brexit so much, when Brexit does *not* lead to a food-crisis, mass unemployment, a recession and international isolation, no matter what else actually happens, Brexit will ultimately be presented as a success in years to come and used to advocate EU exit by others in Europe.",East of England,/r/europe/comments/bhwjlg/heres_why_brexit_wasnt_followed_by_frexit_swexit/elwdiqm/,Occidentarian,1556351656

2235,"I was interested in this book, so I read through the review given above to see why you discard it so. The review is by [Prof. Jim Smith](http://www2.port.ac.uk/school-of-earth-and-environmental-sciences/staff/jim-smith.html) a researcher in the field of environmental impacts of radiation. His track record lends credence to the observations in the manuscript.

An overview of the review, given by the author is that:

&gt; My review, based on nearly thirty years of research on Chernobyl and dozens of visits to the contaminated areas of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, argues that ""Manual for Survival"" ignores the thousands of scientific studies on Chernobyl which are available in the international scientific literature. In doing so, it presents a biased and misleading account of the health and environmental effects of the accident. I believe that this book only perpetuates the many myths about the accident effects and has very little basis in sound science. [cite](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331714767_Review_of_Manual_for_Survival_by_Kate_Brown)

The review states that he book contains a number of flaws and omissions, and is, in the author's own words ""[...] a polemic, not a history book and much less a science book."". Specifically:
* **Dosimetry and Dose Reconstruction
** - Ignoring post-Chernobyl dosimetry studies, and only using partial data from early studies to attempt to discredit the treatment of raditation dose and dose estimation (pg.2-5).
* **Effects on wildlife** - When discussing the effects of low doses of radiation on wildlife,   controversal researchers are cited, and both local Chernobyl wildlife experts, and Belarussian sciences are ignored. There is a biasing to overstate that the effects of low-dose radiation, whereas in the literature it as been shown to not be as significant as generally reported. (While the reviewer doesn't go into too much detail here what the preceived vs actual affects are, I'm under the impression that he is discussing about sensationalist reports of mutations, which is common when discussing Chernobyl.) (pg 5-7)
* **Health effects and Chronic Radiation Sickness** - Large misunderstands of raditaion health effects. The reviewer states that in an interview with the book author ""[...] she very clearly did not know that non-radiation related cancer was very common across the world."". This is followed up with incorrect statements in the book, that describe that radiation is the only known cause of myeloid leukemia (which is isn't). Incorrect claims on the affect of low-dose radiation with regards to Chronic Radiation Sickness. (pg 7-14)
* ...

The list continues, and I won't try to summerize anymore of it here. If you're interested in understanding further, the review is a very good read. 

While I have a large interest in the effects of Chernobyl (I'm cur), reading this review has made me want to avoid this book entirely. While it is a difficult subject (I would recommend reading [Svetlana Alexievich's: Chernobyl Prayer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29675406-chernobyl-prayer) to understand the effect on ordinary people), miscontruding science, even to promote awareness of the issues faced by people still suffer from the effects, is a massive red-flag which should not be accepted.",,/r/europe/comments/bhjinr/its_33_years_since_chernobyl_disaster_here_is_a/elwdqz8/,lurking_around_here,1556352029

2402,"That author really needs to take a look in the mirror if they want to complain about dark money. Open Society Foundation, the international network of NGO and political activist organizations with nearly a billion in expenditures annually, provides funding for the website that wrote this article, Open Democracy. Open Society's work has toppled governments, been banned in several countries, meddled in just about every aspect of politics in nearly every country, and disguises its work by hiding the funding.    
    
[Here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardminiter/2011/09/09/should-george-soros-be-allowed-to-buy-u-s-foreign-policy/#e89fa0816238) is an article from 2001 detailing some of the diabolical political uprisings they've orchestrated and the adverse effects their foreign meddling has had on US foreign policy.     
    
Before anyone claims criticism of Soros is a right-wing attack, the right-wing used to love him:    
    
&gt;In the 1980s and 1990s, when Soros was seen as an anti-communist due to his support of the Polish Solidarity movement to the tune of $3 million per year, the Right defended him as a principled philanthropist.  Conversely, the Left saw conspiracies starring Soros as a CIA asset or a catspaw of American empire.

&gt;The political polarities reversed when Soros spent a fortune trying to defeat President George W. Bush in 2004. Soros donated some $3 million to the Center for American Progress, founded by former Clinton Administration officials, another $2.5 million to MoveOn.org for its anti-GOP efforts and poured $20 million into America Coming Together, a front-group for the Democratic party. 
   
I highly suggest reading this article, it's old and doesn't include the past two decades of political activism and interference in foreign countries.    
    

I find it absurd that a Open Society funded website is publishing an article feigning outrage of 'dark money' because ""In 2016, the Open Society-funded organization Transparify found that Open Society Foundations was the least transparent non-profit among those in the United States which it reviewed. Open Society Foundations earned a global transparency rating of zero stars for non-transparency of the organization’s funding. They were the only group in the United States Transparify reviewed in 2016 to receive such a low grade.[32]

Similarly, the website NGO Monitor wrote that Open Society Foundations’ “Funding of NGOs is entirely non-transparent” as their “annual reports do not provide names of NGO grantees or amounts transferred to individual groups.”    
    
Open Society Foundations was “among the very first foundations” to take advantage of new tax rules that allowed for the rise of political lobbying denounced by liberals—including OSF grantees, as “dark money”—by affiliating the Open Society Policy Center 501(c)(4) with Open Society Foundations.  [59] Stone also touts the fact that Open Society Foundations has a similar operation in Brussels that engages with the European Union.
    
    
More [info](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/open-society-foundations/) can be found here.

*$2.9 billion to defend human rights, especially the rights of women; ethnic, racial, and religious minorities; drug users; sex workers; and LGBTQ communities;
*$2.1 billion for education;
*$1.6 billion on developing democracy in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union;
*$1.5 billion in the United States to promote reform in criminal justice, drug policy, palliative care, education, immigration, equal rights, and democratic governance;
*$737 million for public health issues such as HIV and AIDS, TB, palliative care, harm reduction, and patients' rights;
*$214 million to advance the rights of Roma communities in Europe.

It looks like it's trying to improve health, education, reproductive rights, minority rights, and democratic engagement. What exactly is wrong with that?

2456,"I mean, while I understand your point of Islam being far more conservative in their beliefs than other modern world religions I find it a bit extreme to say that there is no islamism at all. While its debatable how large the portion is, you shouldnt act like there are no Muslims at all that arent islamist. Because we can have the same religion and vastly different political views. The idea that I as a christian am no different than some of those american evangelicals who go around preaching against abortion or gay rights is absurd. When I went to the mosque in the neighbourhood last time, I had a very interesting conversation with one of the young women there. Curious about the conservative views in islam, I asked her about her headscarf and found out to my surprise that she is not even wearing it outside or at home, just when going to prayer. That girl and the people I met there I would definetly not call islamist because they didnt try to force anything on anyone. I am still sceptical about some of the rules and beliefs and will only be convinced if the muslims who are accepting of democracy and freedom of expression actually stand up to the islamists amongst and around them but it seems wrong to ignore that they even exist.

There recently was a voting in the parliament about it. And Erdogan's party, their coalition party (ultranationalist party), and the Kurdish party voted against it. While the secular party and another party voted in favor of it. Erdogan's definition of nationalism is kinda weird.

It really isn't any different than the  [Pledge of Allegiance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge_of_Allegiance) by the way. Which is also ""forced by the American government"". If we would apply your words to it. I don't understand why you get so worked up about it.

&gt;That's because Jewishness is an ethno-religious identity. It's both a religion and an ethnic identity with connection to cultural and traditional elements and experiences of that group. 

This claim is very wrong. Jews are ethnically and culturally very diverse. It's their religion and Israel that connects them. Even the first prime minister of Israel (David Ben-Gurion) was irreligious/an atheist. But I doubt that there are any Israelis out there who don't consider him less of a Jew. In modern-day Israel, the words Israeli and Jew basically mean the same thing. That is why Israel is also called the ""Jewish state"".

And just like the Turks who converted later to Islam, there were Middle Eastern tribes that only later converted to Judaism. And often eventually to Christianity and Islam. Even the Khazar, a Turkic tribe which used to live in modern-day West Russia, only later converted to Judaism.

2522,"&gt; He started to change—every day I met a brand-new person. The burns started to come to the surface. In his mouth, on his tongue, his cheeks—at first there were little lesions, and then they grew. It came off in layers—as white film . . . the color of his face . . . his body . . . blue . . . red . . . gray-brown. And it’s all so very mine! It’s impossible to describe! It’s impossible to write down! And even to get over. The only thing that saved me was it happened so fast; there wasn’t any time to think, there wasn’t any time to cry.

&gt; I loved him! I had no idea how much! We’d just gotten married. We’re walking down the street—he’d grab my hands and whirl me around. And kiss me, kiss me. People are walking by and smiling.

&gt; It was a hospital for people with serious radiation poisoning. Fourteen days. In fourteen days a person dies.

[...]

&gt; I go back to the hospital and there’s an orange on the bedside table. A big one, and pink. He’s smiling: “I got a gift. Take it.” Meanwhile the nurse is gesturing through the film that I can’t eat it. It’s been near him a while, so not only can you not eat it, you shouldn’t even touch it. “Come on, eat it,” he says. “You like oranges.” I take the orange in my hand. Meanwhile he shuts his eyes and goes to sleep. They were always giving him shots to put him to sleep. The nurse is looking at me in horror. And me? I’m ready to do whatever it takes so that he doesn’t think about death. And about the fact that his death is horrible, that I’m afraid of him. There’s a fragment of some conversation, I’m remembering it. Someone is saying: “You have to understand: this is not your husband anymore, not a beloved person, but a radioactive object with a strong density of poisoning. You’re not suicidal. Get ahold of yourself.” And I’m like someone who’s lost her mind: “But I love him! I love him!” He’s sleeping, and I’m whispering: “I love you!” Walking in the hospital courtyard, “I love you.” Carrying his sanitary tray, “I love you.” I remembered how we used to live at home. He only fell asleep at night after he’d taken my hand. That was a habit of his—to hold my hand while he slept. All night. So in the hospital I take his hand and don’t let go.

[...]

&gt; I’m sitting on my little chair next to him at night. At eight I say: “Vasenka, I’m going to go for a little walk.” He opens his eyes and closes them, lets me go. I just walk to the dorm, go up to my room, lie down on the floor, I couldn’t lie on the bed, everything hurt too much, when already the cleaning lady is knocking on the door. “Go! Run to him! He’s calling for you like mad!” That morning Tanya Kibenok pleaded with me: “Come to the cemetery, I can’t go there alone.” They were burying Vitya Kibenok and Volodya Pravik. They were friends of my Vasya. Our families were friends. There’s a photo of us all in the building the day before the explosion. Our husbands are so handsome! And happy! It was the last day of that life. We were all so happy!

&gt; I came back from the cemetery and called the nurse’s post right away. “How is he?” “He died fifteen minutes ago.” What? I was there all night. I was gone for three hours! I came up to the window and started shouting: “Why? Why?” I looked up at the sky and yelled. The whole building could hear me. They were afraid to come up to me. Then I came to: I’ll see him one more time! Once more! I run down the stairs. He was still in his bio-chamber, they hadn’t taken him away yet. His last words were “Lyusya! Lyusenka!” “She’s just stepped away for a bit, she’ll be right back,” the nurse told him. He sighed and went quiet. I didn’t leave him anymore after that. I escorted him all the way to the grave site. Although the thing I remember isn’t the grave, it’s the plastic bag. That bag.

2526,"&gt; It's a typical American sentiment just like when Bush stated to the world: ""You are either with us or against us."" India chose to not give in to the blatant American bully attempt, and chose to cooperate with Soviet Union on their defense.

At the time the Soviet Union was a superpower and wanted to expand their empire if not through warfare through political and social assimilation. Right after WW2, there were one million american soldiers in Europe and they saw what the soviets did to populations they controlled. WW2 on the eastern front was not only the bloodiest but had the most disregard for causing human casualties that Americans have ever seen. 

Such a disregard for human life by the soviets towards their own really freaked out Americans at the time so they had european leaders meet them in new england and America said "" You can have complete access to our huge market, but in exchange you have to help us against stop the soviets from expanding"" and European leaders being very grateful for american leaders not imposing imperialistic measures after such a Pyrrhic victory for many European countries readily agreed. If you look at what the american leaders at the time perceived you can understand why they made sure that there were consequences for helping the soviets economically in any way. They did not want the soviets to get any bigger. In hindsight, we can see that was the best result for all. America had no hard feelihngs towards India because we know that India likes to play all sides for their own benefit. That is understandable and they would not have suffered as much consequence  as Europe or US if the soviet union grew larger.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/bhleyh/eus_best_western_ally_is_now_in_the_east/elvuz0u/,PurpleCheesyTaco,1556330825

And since uneducated white males have been the most pampered and protected group of humans on the planet for quite some time, they now elect all those parties and movements who pretend to better their lives by putting ""the others"" back in their place.

I just did a site search on the party's website and turned up two references to Franco:

&gt; 
&gt; Yariv Lerner added, “We are very happy that the studios will expand their activities in Greece by constructing a film studio in Thermi.

Some people underestimate the amount of Muslim/Turkish flow (I say Turkish because Muslim and Turk was pretty much synonymous in the region for a long time, for example even if one person spoke no Turkish, they were to be considered Turkish because of their religion or vice versa) from Balkans to Turkey.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/bhmyl5/number_of_albanians_in_europe/eluwx92/,ardaofantioch,1556307758

2803,"No, I am saying the term western did not exist in antiquity. Western as a terminology really didn't become a thing till the Renaissance, the Mongol invasions of eastern and central Europe, and the final vestiges of pagan heritage were stamped out in the north of continental Europe, it took 100s of years to become a thing.

 Ancient Greeks saw themselves as part of the civilized world along with those from Persia to India. They saw the rest of Europe as barbarians and would not want to be lumped in with those pants wearing peoples :). That was actually one of the ways ancient Greek text made fun of them, for wearing pants instead of free flowing garbs.  

The Ancient Greeks didn't look down on people from the east, they more thought of them as strange in behavior ,but, still part of civilized humanity. This can be seen in works such as  Dionysiaca by Nonnus, Histories by Herodotus,Cyropaedia by  Xenophon, and of course the work of Ctesias, who wrote Indica.  

Our best evidence of this however, comes from the political marriages of Greek and Indian kings after the conquest of Alexander. Such as the marrying of Seleucus I daughter to king Chandragupta.

Right now, the EU does have laws in place that let it use refugee policy to intake people.  If it wants to do skilled immigration, it has to pass those laws.  Which, I suspect, will be unpopular as well and have a hard time going through.

From a bit later in the video, there are a girl and a boy who had helped the Vietnamese, interviewed after the police evacuated them: https://youtu.be/PjiOJvBa6CA?t=906

Roughly translated:

&gt; Girl: It burned.

&gt; Girl: And nobody was there.

&gt; Girl: And we just tried to save the Vietnamese or to help.

&gt; Girl: And there are still Vietnamese in the house.

&gt; Boy: We just barely managed to get the doors off

&gt; Boy: The Nazis were already on the eighth floor and rioted there.

&gt; Boy: We barely managed to open the roof door.

&gt; Boy: And then we moved on the roof and had much trouble to break open the next door. It really was in last second.

&gt; Girl: We are Germans who don't hate foreigners. We just tried to help. To help.

&gt; Girl: And the cops, they just went away and left us alone. They almost let us burn.

[...]

&gt; Girl: We were six Germans and the Foreigner -

&gt; Boy: No, a few more were there.

&gt; Girl: - and the foreigner representative. And the rest was 200 Vietnamese. With children, with toddlers.

&gt; Girl: And they only watched. They only watched. No police, no firefighters. Nothing We have called. We had a radio system and a radiotelephone. We called everything. There was no help, nothing. They all just watched and cheered and clapped. They clapped that people burn or what do I know. They clapped.

And to be fair to the police, this is something the girl who just survived this shit live couldn't know, some of the police forces were massively exhausted because they were on a 25-hour shift. The riots began on the 22nd of August and this was the 24th of August. It also continued the day after at which point the rioters actively attacked the police, in retaliation that they stopped the burning.

It was an absolute shit show all around. The left was dissatisfied with the police response that almost had 200 people burn and the far right was angry that the police interfered with the progrom, and the centrists were just generally shocked about the violence.

The politicians were also criticized afterwards, because the Germans that lived there were compensated, while the Vietnamese were not only not compensated for the violence and their shit burning, most of them were deported - after being put for three days into a random sports hall without food.

2947,"I recall reading that, statistically, most xenophobia paradoxically originates in areas with little to no exposure to immigration. There are some valid concerns, but the real problem is how much of the current cultural backlash is based on simple fear of change, and contemporary media culture that amplifies negative news (or in the case of social media and a certain non-EU country's state television even makes them up).

The biggest mistake that people can make is to see ""the immigrants"" like one big insect-like hive that can be judged collectively, when in reality it's countless individuals all with their own backgrounds, own faults and virtues, and often hopes and dreams not dissimilar from our own. And to judge people for what they do or how they talk, not how they look like, that should be part of our European identity.

One important thing to keep in mind is history, as we have a lot to learn from it. The reaction and politicization we see now is very reminiscent of the US' ""Yellow Scare"". How much did California really suffer from at one point in time having 10% Chinese immigrants? Migration has always been a thing, no culture exists in isolation.

&gt; ""if you are seeking asylum or for whatever other reason you wish to stay here, we'll allow it and you can become citizen but you will live by our rules [...]""

This I think is sensible. ""Embracing our culture"" I'd consider optional, for why should we care what sort of food they are to eat or what sort of sports they are to play? Those parts of our culture that *have* be universally accepted (EU Charter of Universal Rights) are to be protected by our laws, anyways, so that part is covered by the first half of your sentence.

2975,"&gt; Then maybe you do not really know that much about your own country do you ? The best is to listen to what the vietnamese themselves have to say.

And you think I have never spoken to a Czech-Vietnamese before or what? I grew up in a small Czech town that has Vietnamese people too, so I went to school with Czech-Vietnamese kids all the way through elementary and high school. When I moved out to Brno for Uni, I mostly lost touch with them, but even here I have several Vietnamese in my larger social circle, although I can't say they are my close friends. In most ways, they are as Czech as me. They consider themselves a part of the society and even though of course they all experienced a few racist incidents, the vast majority of their interactions with Czechs are completely normal. And yes, of course there are some bad apples among them, they are some drug producers, but there are criminals in every ethnic group.

&gt; Also there were quite a few articles about foreigners having issues finding accommodation. The landlords just preferred cz/sk people, white europeans ( greeks, spaniards ) and refused to rent to muslims and asians ( because their cuisine smells!!!)

Yes, this is indeed a problem, I won't deny that. Even white Europeans who aren't Slovaks can have a problem as many landlords will not want to bother communication in English. And many do have especially strong prejudices towards some specific groups (as you say, muslims, or other brownish-looking Asians).

3109,"Google, meanwhile, aroused the ire of regulators in other countries last year by failing to obtain consent before sharing data among its fast-growing line of networks and products — from YouTube to Google Photos to Gmail and more. Irish regulators declined to open a probe against Google, which had consolidated most of its operations for Europe, Middle East and Africa in Ireland, arguing that the company had not yet finished the paperwork that would give Irish regulators “lead supervisory authority.” The paperwork was finished in January, but Ireland has yet to announce an investigation.

Critics, including German authorities, insist that the Irish Data Protection Commission had the authority to launch a probe without Google’s consent, and should have done so. Meanwhile, France stepped in to issue its first-ever fine under GDPR against the company for €50 million.

The head of the Irish Data Protection Commission, Helen Dixon, declined requests for interviews. Her spokesman, Graham Doyle, wrote in an emailed response to POLITICO’s questions that the commission takes its regulatory responsibilities seriously and has 16 investigations underway, probing complaints against networks including Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Apple, along with seven probes involving Facebook.

The Irish Data Protection Commission is “one of the most strongly resourced data protection authorities in Europe” and stands ready to impose “fines and firm remedies when appropriate,” he wrote.

Doyle said the commission, which earlier this decade was so obscure it was headquartered in a small office above a convenience store in the tiny village of Portarlington, is recruiting state-of-the-industry experts to join its staff of approximately 140 people currently working out of temporary offices in Dublin, with a goal of eventually employing 180 people.

He noted the agency’s tough new enforcement powers include fines of up to 4 percent of a company’s annual worldwide revenues and cited the agency’s willingness to enforce privacy rules by pointing to a pre-GDPR case in which Irish regulators ordered LinkedIn to delete data on nonmembers.

He rejected any suggestion that the agency is being overly deferential to companies under its purview, but added: “Those with an interest in data protection don’t always agree on every point, and we respect that.”

Nonetheless, regulators in other EU countries, particularly Germany, remain skeptical, maintaining that Ireland is letting major complaints slide and creating the risk of a regulatory safe zone in Europe. So, too, are independent experts who are familiar with the actions of the Irish Data Protection Commission.

“It’s the appearance of an investigation rather than the substance of one,” said the independent Dublin-based data management consultant Daragh O’Brien, referring to the Ireland's data enforcement culture, which he scrutinizes closely.

Max Schrems, an Austrian privacy advocate behind some of the most successful legal challenges against major technology companies, said he believes Ireland’s approach to regulation is more or less unchanged since 2012.

“They’ve basically gotten smarter about not doing things,” said Schrems, whose initial complaint about transatlantic sharing of data was thrown out by the Irish regulator in 2013, only to succeed in European courts, bringing down the transatlantic data flow known as Safe Harbor.

Ireland continues to take a more corporate-friendly approach to regulation than many of its EU counterparts, openly favoring negotiation over sanctions and lists of questions over on-site inspections.
 
For example, as of last October, the Data Protection Commission had yet to dispatch any regulatory agents to Facebook’s Dublin headquarters, despite its multiple investigations, according to a person close to the matter who spoke under the condition of anonymity. Rather than seek answers more aggressively, the regulator has been satisfied by “updates” from Facebook’s headquarters that often reveal little more than what’s been said in public statements. Both Facebook and the DPC declined to say whether any on-site visits had taken place since 2011.

Around the same time, France posted its own regulatory officers inside Facebook’s offices to monitor the network’s efforts to police hate speech and terrorist content, a core concern in many countries where terrorists have connected via social media and hate speech encouraged racist or sectarian violence. But France has no authority to enforce standards beyond its borders.

Privacy watchdogs also voice concerns about the 2014 appointment of Dixon, an Irish civil servant with no prior experience in regulatory enforcement, to replace Billy Hawkes, the regulator who initially presided over the finding of Facebook’s over-sharing of data with researchers and developers of third-party apps.

If Ireland were serious about cracking down on privacy violations, some legal professionals said, it would have followed the lead of the United Kingdom and appointed an outside specialist with a history in law enforcement or regulatory investigation. Moreover, they said, Dixon’s budget is overseen by the Irish Justice Ministry, while other data regulators, like the U.K.’s, are financed through fees on the companies they oversee. That could make her, or any future chief regulator, more susceptible to interference by government officials, who have long cultivated close relationships with tech executives.

In 2014, Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, personally lobbied Enda Kenny, then Ireland’s prime minister, over the selection of a data protection chief, according to emails revealed by the Irish Independent.

Now, just as some of its investigations should be wrapping up — with Dixon telling Bloomberg News in January that her office would announce decisions by midyear — the Data Protection Commission is launching an “international consultation on regulation strategy” that some critics fear will be an invitation for corporations to critique its practices.

Doyle said the agency will reach out to a broad range of as yet unnamed parties to weigh in on how Ireland should apply regulation. Doyle declined to say whether those consultants would come from the tech industry, only specifying that the panel would be “international.”

The call for advice is symptomatic of what Dixon’s critics among privacy advocates, lawyers and other EU data protection authorities argue is a preference for resolving issues amicably over public enforcement actions, which Dixon, in speeches, has suggested might expose the regulator to extremely costly legal battles. It’s a reasonable fear in a place where the tech companies’ resources far outstrip the government’s. Google’s market capitalization, by itself, is twice the size of Ireland’s gross domestic product. Facebook’s is larger by about a third.

“Regulation is a particularly fraught area for a country like Ireland because they have less leverage [over companies] than a bigger country,” said Josephine Wolff, a professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology. “If Facebook announced tomorrow, ‘We’ve had it with Ireland, we are closing down our office,’ that would be a huge deal with political and economic consequences for the whole country.”",France,/r/europe/comments/bhmcoh/how_one_country_ireland_blocks_the_world_on_data/eltvqo3/,Ayasta,1556286121

3115,"**Bringing Silicon Valley to Europe**

The story of how a country known for poetry and dark ale ended up in the unlikely role of global tech policeman stretches back to the aftermath of World War II.

As a neutral power, Ireland had emerged physically undamaged from the war but with a sputtering economy and bleak prospects. It had limited access to U.S. reconstruction funds from the European Recovery Program, or Marshall Plan, due to its neutral position, and no industrial base to speak of, thanks largely to Britain's long-held interest in keeping Roman Catholic southern Ireland in a firmly agrarian state. (Ireland won independence from Britain in 1919.) There was little chance of jump-starting domestic manufacturing 250 years after the rest of Europe, so Irish leaders turned to the next best thing: nurturing ties with countries that had flourishing industries of their own.

Spurred on by an economist and central banker named Thomas Kenneth Whitaker, Ireland’s leaders oversaw an economic transformation starting in the late 1950s — away from protectionism, toward free trade and encouraging foreign investment. The most obvious partner was the United States, to which generations of Irish people had emigrated and whose Irish-origin population already far surpassed the population at home.

So began Ireland’s epic and enduring courtship of U.S. corporations. Via the Irish Development Agency, a powerful entity that acts as a sales office for the country, the Emerald Isle established missions across the United States, dispatching dozens of agents to start preaching the good word about Ireland to U.S. companies from New York to San Francisco.

One of these investment missionaries was Larry Mone, a former accountant who joined the IDA in the late 1970s because he was, in his own words, “really bad at” accounting.

After a brief stint in Chicago, Mone was sent out to join the IDA’s office in what was already known as Silicon Valley. In an office that overlooked a golf course, Mone and his colleagues spent their days trying to coax emerging digital giants — Microsoft chief among them — over to Ireland. Working from an alphabetical list of the important companies in the region, they spent their days cold-calling executives in an atmosphere he describes as “boiler room-like.”


“We had an almost messianic zeal to bring jobs to Ireland,” Mone, who’s now retired and lives in Palo Alto, said in a telephone conversation.

Mone’s section of the list covered companies with names from the letter G to the letter O and included giants like Microsoft and Intel, which would both go on to establish major footholds in Ireland. Apple set up its first manufacturing plant in Cork in 1980, setting off a wave of tech companies coming to the country.

The pitch, as Mone recalled, was “very simple.” Any product exported from Ireland would be totally exempt from taxation. That was later updated, under EU pressure, to a 10-percent flat rate that could be offset in other ways. When added to the promise of cheap labor, cheap land and an English-speaking workforce, this amounted to an almost unbeatable argument for locating sales operations in Ireland, because it would allow U.S. firms to reach hundreds of millions of European consumers without facing the heavy corporate taxes in France, Germany or even the Netherlands.

The IDA’s approach had other refinements, like inviting top tech executives over to Ireland for country tours during which they would be entertained, fed whiskey and “sent home punch-drunk, in love with the country,” according to Mone. It didn’t hurt that Ireland shares a common-law legal system with the United States.

But the basic argument — which remains Ireland’s unique selling point today, despite intensifying scrutiny of its tax practices by the European Commission — never varied: not having to hand over a significant portion of income to the Irish taxman.

“At the end of the day, these are profit-drive companies, and they go where the offer is the most profitable,” Mone said.

Data regulation wasn’t an issue at the time when most of the companies were recruited, but Ireland did everything in its power to create an industry-friendly landscape.

“Back in those days there really was not much thought given to regulation of the technology industry, more what could be done to foster its development and bring it on shore,” he said.

The pitch was so seductive that, over the next 30 years, Ireland morphed into what Mone calls “the 51st state of the United States.”

Google and Facebook both landed in Ireland during the first decade of the new century. While the highly advantageous tax arrangements they enjoyed came under pressure from the European Commission (Apple was forced to pay the Irish government $13 billion in back taxes that Ireland had neglected to collect), regulation was just starting to become a concern.
 
Ireland's 1995 Data Protection Act lacked significant enforcement mechanisms — so much so that Billy Hawkes, then the head of the Irish Data Protection Commission, had no legal power to apply any sanctions or penalties against the companies he was regulating in the years leading up to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. His successor, Dixon, herself acknowledged the lax culture in 2015, one year into her job, mentioning the problem of “forum-shopping” and perceptions that companies locate where “soft, incompetent or under-resourced regulators are.”

In the event that any regulatory issue should arise, as it did in the 2011 audit involving Facebook’s sharing of data with app developers, U.S. companies had a powerful insurance policy: access to top Irish politicians via direct contacts or through the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland in Dublin, which continues to play an outsize role in shaping the direction of Irish policy. Top tech executives had Hawkes’ cellphone number and could access him directly whenever they had a need, according to two people with knowledge of such calls.

This welcoming atmosphere explains why Facebook, in particular, kept doubling down on its Irish presence throughout the 2000s, according to Sandy Parakilas, former operations manager for Facebook who left the company in 2012.

“It was simply the country with the least regulatory scrutiny,” he explained in a phone conversation from Los Angeles, where he is now senior product marketing manager, privacy, for Apple.

That statement was put to the test during Ireland’s 2011 audit of the company. Prompted by a groundswell of complaints against Facebook, Hawkes’ deputy, Gary Davis, undertook what is likely to have been the most in-depth review of Facebook’s privacy practices ever. In his capacity as lead regulator not just for Europeans but Facebook users worldwide, Davis’ staff spent three months scouring the company’s machinery, including sending officers to its Dublin headquarters to investigate first hand.

His first report, published in December 2011, called for dozens of changes and upgrades to Facebook’s privacy practices, including its practices for screening third-party apps.

“We do not consider that reliance on developer adherence to best practice or stated policy in certain cases is sufficient to ensure security of user data,” the report stated. “This is not considered sufficient by this Office to assure users of the security of their data once they have third party apps enabled. We expect FB-I [Facebook Ireland] to take additional steps to prevent applications from accessing user information other than where the user has granted an appropriate permission.”

Parakilas, who was Facebook's “point person” on privacy matters at the time, said the criticism did not rile the company. Facebook responded to the audit in a “professional manner” but did not feel pressure to make fundamental changes, he said. When Parakilas tried to escalate concerns about the key critical findings in the original audit report, he was brushed off by senior executives.

At the time, Facebook expressed its concern about the audit to Irish officials, according to later testimony by Dixon before a government committee. Afterward, the Data Protection Commission appeared to go out of its way to give Facebook a clean bill of health.

In a 74-page follow-up report published in 2012, the commission declared that “most of the recommendations [had] been fully implemented to our full satisfaction.” On its call to improve screening of third-party apps, where major problems later emerged, the report stated: “Satisfactory response from FB-I.” A year later, Davis left the commission to join Apple as its chief privacy officer.

""They didn't go anywhere near as far as you would have hoped,"" Parakilas said, referring to the Irish commission. Parakilas, who left Facebook in 2012, added that he doubts Ireland’s approach to regulation has changed substantially.

3128,"Asked whether Ireland had done enough to stop the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Doyle said the commission had gone as far as it could, within its legal limitations, in simply flagging the problem with app developers and seeking changes to Facebook’s privacy practices. He pointed to comments Davis had made outside the report saying there were “still a number of items on which progress has not been as ‘fully forward’ as hoped,” although the issues flagged did not have to do with third-party apps. In 2017, Helen Dixon told the Irish parliamentary committee that Facebook “did not agree with the recommendation” for significant changes to its privacy rules in 2011, and that the changes were made only through an “iterative process” 18 months later.

Facebook disputes that account.

In comments to POLITICO, a spokesperson said that the company had “complied fully” with all requested changes, and claimed that the Irish regulator had never requested any changes that would have prevented the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

Hawkes, who at the time was the top Irish regulator, declined to comment on the matter, according to a spokeswoman at the International Association of Privacy Professionals, a nonprofit association that brings together people working on data protection. Gary Davis did not respond to repeated requests for comment and a spokesperson for Apple, where Davis now works, did not respond.

**Facebook flexes its muscles**

The years that followed Davis’ audit brought Facebook’s relationship with Ireland to new levels of closeness.

In 2013, the commission dismissed Schrems’ claim against the company over data transfers to the United States, calling the suit frivolous. The company then won an award of funds from Ireland’s national asset management agency — the so-called “bad bank” that took over assets on troubled lenders during the financial crisis — to build its Frank Gehry-designed headquarters in Dublin.

When the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke in 2018, the U.K. launched an investigation and fined the company, while Ireland merely issued recommendations. A few months after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared before the U.S. Congress and European Parliament to answer questions from lawmakers, the company announced the construction of a new 14-acre campus in Dublin and the opening of several new data centers in County Meath, north of Dublin.

As far back as 2014, the question of how Ireland would handle the new privacy rules under the GDPR was on the minds of Facebook’s leaders. As it happened, Ireland was in the process of choosing a new chief data regulator to replace Hawkes. Sandberg took it on herself to investigate the matter, lobbying then Irish Prime Minister Kenny on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos and also at her offices in Menlo Park, Calif.

According to emails obtained by the Irish Independent via Freedom of Information requests, Sandberg wanted to know that Hawkes’ successor would be “as strong as” he had been in the role. But if the wrong choice was made, Sandberg suggested, there would be consequences for Ireland’s attractiveness as a destination for tech investment.

“The risk is that companies will revisit their investment strategies for the EU market,” she wrote in a June, 2014, email to Kenny, adding that Ireland’s regulator should be a person who would “establish a strong collaborative working relationship with companies like ours.”

The choice of Dixon, a former Irish civil servant with a law degree but no background in law enforcement or regulatory investigation, was in line with Sandberg’s wishes. Before she became one of the most important privacy regulators in the world, Dixon had spent four years working for U.S. software company Citrix, followed by a stint at the business-friendly Irish Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.

While the regulator’s statutes called for the appointment of three co-equal directors in order to properly separate the agency’s enforcement and adjudication roles, the other two were never named.

TJ McIntyre, a law professor at University College Dublin who sued the government over the process under which Dixon was chosen, complained that she’s “not coming from that investigatory and enforcement perspective.”

Instead, he said, Dixon was chosen to supervise the DPC’s development into a more substantial regulator than the one housed above a convenience store in Portarlington, building a bureaucratic structure rather than targeting specific issues.

In speeches and interviews, Dixon has emphasized the need to engage with tech companies to help them understand the law, rather than cultivate adversarial relationships.

“We are very committed to this approach of engaging with the multinationals,” she told the Irish Times in 2016. “We do firmly believe the way in which we work with them produces much better safeguards for data subjects.”

That approach yields good results in terms of compliance, said Bojana Bellamy, who runs the Centre for Information Policy Leadership, an industry-backed privacy think tank whose members include Facebook and Apple.

“I do believe that constructive engagement is incredibly important to build that trust,” she said. “Sticks and enforcement — that doesn’t create the best behavior in the marketplace.”

Ireland’s more conciliatory approach is now fueling tension with other EU regulators. After France’s data watchdog fined Google €50 million in January for failing to comply with GDPR, Germany’s prominent Hamburg data regulator told the regulatory-analysis publication MLex that Ireland should be investigating the company. In a separate statement to POLITICO, the German watchdog underscored “differences” in the way Irish and German authorities interpreted and enforced EU rules, singling out “face recognition techniques by Facebook” and the “exchange of data between WhatsApp and Facebook.”

“Unfortunately, it has not yet been possible to set up the data protection we have enforced in national court proceedings against Facebook at the EU level,” wrote professor Johannes Caspar, head of the Hamburg regulator. “After the transmission of user data between WhatsApp and Facebook was stopped, they [Facebook] took the entry into force of the GDPR as an opportunity to return to their former practice.”

Zuckerberg’s announcement of plans to merge WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram messaging were also “reason for concern,” added Caspar, echoing the German Justice Ministry’s warning that such a merger would create a “monopoly” and call for enforcement of European antitrust rules.

While the Irish regulator said it would examine the implications of such a merger, France echoed the German concerns.

“In general, in relation to Facebook, you have a pattern where other regulatory authorities have been much more active and found themselves thwarted by the fact that Facebook was headquartered in Ireland,” said McIntyre, adding that “enforcement has been lax.”

Jimmy Stewart, an adjunct professor of finance at Trinity Business School at Trinity College Dublin, said less rigorous regulation is part of Ireland’s strategy.

Google, Facebook, Twitter and other companies like them make their money by harvesting vast amounts of data on users that is used to target them more precisely with advertising. Thanks to the data collected on Facebook, an advertiser can pinpoint categories of users down to hyper-minute criteria including their age, sexual orientation, health issues or political beliefs. This technology has allowed tech platforms to corner the global market for online advertising, turning them into juggernauts worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

But those dollars could disappear if regulators interfere with the tech giants’ ability to collect and hold that information.

“Regulatory arbitrage is an important part of the country’s arsenal” to attract tech companies “along with tax incentives,” Stewart said.",France,/r/europe/comments/bhmcoh/how_one_country_ireland_blocks_the_world_on_data/eltvvj6/,Ayasta,1556286214

3226,"&gt; I spoke of Berlin in particular. It wasn't missed on me that the former Prussian capital has nothing Prussian left

Berlin is covered with Prussian shit and if the monuments and architecture aren't enough for you then Berlin, like most of Germany, is lousy with historical museums, monuments, and memorials. Again, stop talking about something you know nothing about.

&gt;But before I say more, I wonder what your opinion on Prussia or, let's say, German Sonderweg are?

For those that don't know, the German Sonderweg is a myth that states the German nation has undergone a course from aristocracy to democracy unlike any other, and that the culminating events of German history made the rise of Naziism inevitable.

The first tenet is bullshit ""my yard is special because it's mine"" thinking. To say that the German path was unique is to say that there is a ""normal"" path to take towards democracy and Germans didn't take it, when in fact, every nation has transitioned from aristocracy to democracy in a unique way based on their circumstances. If there is a German Sonderweg then there must also be a French Sonderweg, a Polish Sonderweg, an American Sonderweg, an Argentinian Sonderweg etc.

The second holds some weight if you look at German history in the 19th and 20th century especially, but I think it runs the risk of coming far too close to excusing people if Naziism were to be seen as inevitable and therefor no one is to blame.

Funny. France has closed its borders with Italy and is refusing people there. They are illegally sending people back to Spain. And whenever a request is made from Italy to other EU countries to take in a new boat that has arrived, France is quiet despite also being on the Mediterranean coast.

3253,"Excuse me, not to appeal to authority or anything, but are you really telling a native Greek speaker about how to pronounce something in Greek? You're thinking of Ancient Greek. There have been massive shifts in the pronunciation of Greek in the past 2-3 millennia.

It's now ""always"" pronounced that way. In Greek, the eta the same as the iota (a short ""ee"" sound, occasionally a glide similar to ""y"" in ""yes"") since at least the 4th century AD. The same exact thing happened with the ""ει"" diphthong: it shifted to be pronounced like a simple iota. This phenomenon in which multiple vowels in Greek shifted to an ""ee"" sound is called [iotacism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iotacism).

The other thing is that at some point, although I'm not informed enough to say when exactly, ""n"" sounds that are followed by a ""p"" sound started shifting to ""m"", and the ""p"" started shifting to ""b"". So the ν-π combination (τη**ν Π**όλιν) becomes ""mb"". In the past century, and largely in continental Greece, this has shifted further to be simply ""b"", but in medieval Greek, since at least the 10th century, it was pronounced ""mb"".

Taking all of the above into consideration, we can say with large certainty that Turks this is what the Turks encountered when they came into contact with Greeks and the Greek language: ""is-timbolin"".

Also if you check the exact same source you linked (the Wiktionary article) for the words [εἰς](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B5%E1%BC%B0%CF%82#Ancient_Greek) and [ἡ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%A1#Ancient_Greek) (the latter being the nominative of τὴν) Wiktionary clearly shows how the pronunciation of the words/letters shifted throughout the centuries under the ""Pronunciation"" section.

It is important to note that many scholarly descriptions of Greek pronunciation, such as the one of ""εις την Πόλιν"" that is given in the entry you linked, use the classical Attic pronunciation, even if the context means that that pronunciation is wildly outdated. Not sure if this is done erroneously or if there's a reason scholars prefer to use the Attic pronunciation even if outdated in a specific context.",,/r/europe/comments/bfz4tt/the_actual_chain_used_by_the_eastern_roman_empire/eltolpk/,drinkwatergang,1556279545

Also:

&gt;The public is often led to believe that the Chernobyl exclusion zone, a depopulated 20-mile circle around the blown plant, safely contains Chernobyl radioactivity. Tourists and journalists exploring the zone rarely realise there is a second Chernobyl zone in southern Belarus. In it, people lived for 15 years in levels of contamination as high as areas within the official zone until the area was finally abandoned, in 1999.

[...]

&gt;England, for example, enjoyed clear weather for several days after the Chernobyl accident, but rain started on 2 May, 1986 and fell heavily on the Cumbrian fells – 20mm in 24 hours. On the uneven, upland terrain, radioactive fallout pooled in rivulets and puddles. The needles on radiation detectors at the Sellafield (formerly Windscale) nuclear processing plant went upwards alarmingly, 200 times higher than natural background radiation. From 5 becquerels a square metre, radiation levels in topsoil spiked to 4,000 bq/m2. Kenneth Baker, the then environment secretary, issued assurances that the radioactive isotopes would soon be washed away by rain.

Two months later, however, levels rose yet higher to 10,000 bq/m2 in Cumbria and 20,000 bq/m2 in south-western Scotland, 4,000 times higher than normal. Scientists tested sheep and found their levels of caesium-137 were 1,000 becquerels per kilogram – too high for consumption. In the midst of general anxiety, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fish and Food (MAFF) issued temporary restrictions on the sale of meat for 7,000 farms.

3365,"&gt; Er, falsely? I've heard enough horror stories. (I hope it wasn't a personal ""you"", BTW).

My friend, we all have heard horror stories, and you do not have to tell me - a socially liberal cosmopolitan Riga inhabittant - that our country has a huge buttload of people that are insanely regressive, racist and also outright hateful towards Russians. I will also point out that these people hate me just as much as they hate you. They loathe my social progressiveness, and if they might see you as an ''occupant'', they see me as an enabler of pedophilia and the destruction of Latvia. However horror stories are horror stories, these are anecdotes - bad experiences that colour our lives and lead to biases. As an example - I have a fear of dogs, because of my horror experience, but that does not mean that statistically and rationally dogs are dangerous to human beings. 

You are right that we face issues with xenophobic attitudes in Latvia towards Russians, but you cannot state that this is a majority Latvian view, for example: '' Tikai 24% respondentu uzskata etnisko piederību par nozīmīgu faktoru saskarsmē ar citiem cilvēkiem. Tomēr ģimenes partnera etniskā piederība ir nozīmīga 45% respondentu.'' [study in 2012](http://cilvektiesibas.org.lv/media/record/docs/2012/09/27/kid_LAT.pdf) (Note, the 24% is likely a bit misleading due to the rate of encountered ethnic discrimination which was over 50%)


&gt; You literally ask me to believe some studies over my own eyes.

Because this is how science works. Go back to my example about dogs - our own personal experiences are not indicative of the wider reality. And when it comes to policy - we need to base policy on fact based evidence, and I hope you agree with me here. You, personally, might have had a bad experience with your children receiving worse results in chemistry, but the bigger picture reveals that the reform has **helped Latvian Russian children get better job and education opportunities**. This is what matters - that Russian Latvians are not impeded by the sins and failures of both their predecessors, the state or our historical reality. And it's clear that the way how we can help Russian Latvians is by helping them learn Latvian as much as possible, and - yes - the current support in my eyes is not enough, and we need to put in more financing on language lessons for younger children, especially from poor families, integrated kindergartens and so on. 

It's just clear that the ''two-stream'' policy of having Russian and Latvian speaking schools has led to e.g. linguistic segregation, and this is horrible in my eyes. We're all Latvians.

&gt; They will need some other language, probably English.

If you want your children to be proper chemists or physicists, first I'd recommend not letting them get an education in Latvia at all, since our education and science sphere is woefully underfunded as it is - if they are top performers they won't have an issue getting in a good uni abroad. 

&gt; And that's if they will be able to pass entrance exams... after losing out ""a bit on their ability to master high school chemistry and physics"".

As I said in one of the first posts - this is an issue I completely understand and am aware of, and can be attributed to a rushed implementation of a policy without recognizing the core issue of low Latvian knowledge levels in younger children. I say again - I am genuinely sorry your experience was horrible, but recognise for most Russian Latvian children the reform has improved their chances to succeed in life - also as chemists and physicists.

&gt; It's not me who's restricting their ability to communicate in Latvian.

If people seriously think democracy means ""well majority wants it, so lets fucking roll with it regardless of anything"", then our democracy is shit.

In a lot of ways Athenian Democracy was more democratic than today because even though the vote was restricted to maybe around 30 % of the adult population, citizens were actively involved in the democratic process, certain officies were distributed by lottery and their state was small enough for a human to grasp, thus everyone should get confronted with problems sooner or later and it was reasonable to know the politicians personally (and in vis a vis conversations people are more likely to show empathy for differing positions).

3386,"&gt; Drink, coffee, candy, but also clock, pictures, flowers or expensive pens and clothes - be sure to buy your doctor as a thank you. Now you will need to add one more item to these thoughts - how to fit it and not to exceed the sum of 462 euros. And that's so by law.
&gt; 
&gt; Although this sounds to my likes as if it were true or not, it is true that Serbia recently literally legalized the giving of gifts to doctors.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the Law on Health Care, which was adopted at the beginning of April, and says that the individual gift should not exceed the value of 2.726 dinars, and the total net average salary in Serbia, which currently amounts to 54.521 dinars. 
&gt; 
&gt; **A gift of gratitude was shared by the citizens**
&gt; 
&gt; The details do not indicate whether it is a gift before or after an intervention or examination, but since the provision itself is called a ""thank you"", it is assumed that it is a post-doctoral work period. 
&gt; 
&gt; These new provisions of the Law have been significantly shared by the public, and now one comments that it is legalizing corruption, while others consider that corruption is reduced to certain frameworks.
&gt; 
&gt; The most controversial member is Article 234 of the Law entitled ""Conflict of Interest"" and in which we quote: ""It sets a ban for healthcare workers and associates, members of the public health care institution, as well as members of their immediate families, to seek or receive money, gift, service or any other benefit "", which seems to have now become a unique sum.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, the Law states that they may not seek or receive gifts if they ""can affect impartiality or professional performance of duties"", that is, if they ""can be considered as a prize in connection with the performance of duties and the performance of healthcare activity"". 
&gt; 
&gt; The fact is that giving a doctor a gift is something more than a frequent practice in the Serbs and that rarely anyone has met with this in his life.
&gt; 
&gt; The social networking polls went so far that two surveys were posted to which Twitter users were responding if the doctor had ever been openly or covertly asked for money or some gift to provide some necessary health care. 31 percent of respondents answered yes to this poll, while 69 percent answered ""no"". The number of people who voted is almost 4,000.
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, the situation is different when the second question is: Have you ever given a cash or non-cash gift to a doctor on your own initiative? In that case, 59 percent answered affirmatively, and 41 percent negative, on a sample of 1,405 votes. 
&gt; 
&gt; If the Law was controversial in this way, the Transparency Serbia organization, which sent its letter to the Anti-Corruption Agency and the relevant ministries, also assessed. It mentions, first of all, that the provision of ""gifts of gratitude"" for health workers is poorly formulated.
&gt; 
&gt; Although this law strictly prohibits the gift of a doctor from being cash, what Transparency Serbia sees as a problem is the definition of a ""gift of gratitude"" in general. 
&gt; 
&gt; - There is no doubt that the gifts of grateful patients and members of their families are widespread practice and that this practice should be regulated, but in such a way that it does not create a sense of obligation for the patient to give a gift, and in the case of health workers expectation of such a gift or temptation to act unequally at future encounters with the one who gave the gift - states Transparency's letter.
&gt; 
&gt; **Better the institution than the individual**
&gt; 
&gt; They add that the entire law should go towards education of the public in order to reduce the number of situations in which patients will consider giving gratitude gifts necessary, and in the opinion of Transparency Serbia, it is more useful to pay attention to the work of the institution, not an individual. 
&gt; 
&gt; - The lawmakers voted that these gifts ""are not considered corruption, conflict of interest"". This norm is contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code. It is not possible to exclude in advance the possibility that someone would act biased and provide a patient with a service that does not belong to him or gave him priority in the next intervention and because of such a small gift - explain in Transparency.
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, the Medical Chamber does not see it as a controversial provision.
&gt; 
&gt; **""We come to a bad voice""**
&gt; 
&gt; - The Medical Chamber of Serbia does not consider that the aforementioned provision of the Law on Health Protection legalizes corruption, nor does it openly indicate to patients that such gifts are desirable. This provision is also harmonized with a similar provision from the Law on Public Servants and is in line with EU legislation, which also regulates the field of gifts for public officials, and therefore healthcare workers - says Dr. Milan Dinić, director of the Medical Chamber of Serbia. 
&gt; 
&gt; He explained that doctors in their work were obliged by Hippocratic oath, and the ethical code of the Medical Chamber of Serbia itself states that ""apart from the regular reward for the work of a doctor in the form of salaries, fees or other personal benefits, as well as the satisfaction that he helped the patient, obtaining other material benefits from work of doctors is not in accordance with ethical standards "".
&gt; 
&gt; -Therefore, we consider that the editing of this area was necessary, because as long as the custom of expressing gratitude to gifts does not start to emerge in our society, doctors, like many other civil servants, will continue to come to a bad voice in public precisely because of the gifts that citizens , as a rule, on their own initiative. Therefore, we believe that the introduction of transparency in this relationship is beneficial for both doctors and patients - says Dinic.
&gt; 
&gt; However, in the law none of the members defines whether doctors will be obliged to apply gratitude gifts, to whom they report them at all and how the whole ""procedure"" will look.

Generally speaking it's not a liberal-minded country (progressive yes, but not liberal in the sense of tolerating civil disobedience). People concern themselves with the business to a greater extent than most countries I've lived in. 

This isn't necessarily sinister, but compared to France and the UK, if there are a bunch of foreigners hanging out on the street the Germans tend to notice and be concerned.

It's also quite a morally judgemental country, perhaps owing to its history, Germans seem to feel the need to check behaviour in their communities and take issue with behaviour that doesn't meet the expected societal standards. 

Add to this that it's significantly more white European than the ex-colonial nations in Europe. It has a lot of foreigners, but a lot of these are Southern and Eastern Europeans which don't stand out in the same way as people from more divergent cultures of different ethnicity.

The hypocrisy I'm talking about it are people who, when asked, will always claim to be positive about foreigners and migration from all over the world signalling strongly a ""I'm not racist"" position. However, the moment their everyday social cohesion is ever so slightly disrupted by the presence of foreigners they have a strongly negative reaction. 

What many actually think is, ""I very much like foreigners (*provided they assimilate and integrate to the very unique and comprehensive expectations of German society, cause no changes to the character of my neighbourhood, speak our difficult language at a very high level and generally don't do anything that might cause me offence)"".

The problem is, and I say this coming from one of those no-go zones that Trump liked to single out, that this is a fantasy. Immigrant populations bring inevitable social change, even the so-called ""good immigrants"" that do make large efforts to integrate.  

There's a somewhat patronising belief amongst some that they can take foreigners in large numbers and completely integrate them with German ""Leitkultur"" (leading culture); a notion that rings hollow to anyone from a country with a higher level of non-European immigrants. 

Britain and France both had the legacy of imperialism meaning they, to some degree, had to acknowledge that their immigrants were ""their problem"" and part of their culture, such that it was British and French culture that had to adapt and change to accommodate them to some degree. 

This sentiment isn't as prevalent in Germany, so while they will take the foreigners in line with their prevailing moral sentiment, I would question how prepared for the social changes that will inevitably follow.

3427,"It does actually. Cities were largely deserted and society more or less collapsed. In some places rural landowners offered protection to people in return for labour, in the beginnings of feudalism. In many places people moved to or started small wooden villages, no more concrete pillars and Roman architecture. The knowledge of all that was lost, with barbarians happily burning down libraries. Europe became unsafe to travel in and currency more or less disappeared over time. As a result trade collapsed as well. No trade routes, no cities, a lot of lost knowledge, and Europeans trying to claw their way back up.

The one thing that kept society together somewhat is the Church. The Church offered support, hope and stability. Despite the collapse of the entire Roman civilization, people weren't stupid. They made do with what they had and invented water mills for example. They didn't know about yeast, but they knew how to use it. They made bread and cider (after all water was undrinkable). The ruins of past structures like aqueducts are a reminder of the past and there's no one with the knowledge to maintain or rebuild them, and especially no central government that could start such massive projects.

It was slow progress, but by the 1300s we were due for a Renaissance, if it weren't for the black death. It would've been different for sure, this was the time of Gothic architecture and there wasn't as much fascination (and available knowledge of antiquity), but currencies had made a comeback, Europe was safer to travel, merchants sailed across the Mediterranean and Baltic seas and traveled by land from Florence to Flanders.

3455,"It's really not a lot of waste, because it is so damn efficient....

And in contrast to other plants with fuel, they actually store the thrash instead of putting it in the environment. You just need a few buildings to store it in. 

Wind energy and solar energy cannot solve our problems on their own, and every solution to the climate problem proposed by the IPCC includes nuclear for this reason.

Meanwhile, everytime we close a nuclear plant we condemn people to death, because they get replaced by dirtier fossil-fuel plants. The reduction in pollution of nuclear plants literally saves lives. Why do you want to people to die because you are too afraid to finally store our waste for once? All our other waste gets burned, thrown into oceans and pumped into the atmosphere.

Did you know coal plants actually pump actual radio-active waste *into* the atmosphere? That's right. And no one is closing those down for that reason. 

Lastly, the effects of low doses of radiations are vastly overblown, and more people die because of the fear of radiation than radiation effects alone. Look at Fukushima. Only 1 person *may* have died because of the radiation effects, meanwhile many more died due to needless evacuations, due to epidemics and poor healthcare (especially for elderly). So, it's not even better to be ""safe than sorry"", because these fearful decisions kill people.

For more information about our needless fear of information, you could read this: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13752-016-0244-4 

This article lays out that the harmful effects of low doses of radiation have *never* been or measured with any significant effect(with low doses I mean those doses that are in the order of the standards set by goverments and medical community). Yet, the hypothesis that is harmful has been accepted as true by the scientific and medical community, probably because ""it is better to be safe than sorry"". The eye-opener in this article that *really* drives this point home is this: Your body is constantly damaging itself and its own DNA just by metabolic processes. Your body burns the fuel it consumes, and it damages itself all the time. **The amount of spontaneous DNA mutations due to normal metabolism is *2.5 million times larger* than those you could expect from 3mSv of radiation exposure per year.** Let this sink in. Just consider how little damage radiation actually does, compared to how much damage your body does yourself. The article also explains why this is not a problem, as it lays out that it has already been established that the body has several mechanisms to deal with DNA damage. Sadly, it's not a perfect mechanism, and people die of cancer anyway, but it is clear that the radiation standards set these days are not even close to the constant barrage of self-mutilation your body does to itself.

Radiation can still kill, and it has obviously been proven to kill at high doses, but guess what... that's how everything works in life. There's always a lethal dose, and what we protect ourselves against now is not even close to the lethal dose.",,/r/europe/comments/bhc4bh/german_town_tries_to_fight_the_erection_of_a_wind/eltecsk/,_________-__,1556265273

That is your problem that you believe some conspiracy that social scientists who are generally left-leaning (i.e. against ethnonationalism) want to support the official position that is generally influenced by centre-right and nationalistic political forces.

&gt; Yep, which is encompassed by an even broader problem of ethnic discrimination. 

In which way? 

&gt; Sorry, what? Is it my job? What the hell am I paying my taxes for? I'm not qualified to teach even English, which I know better. 

Studies of expats in Sweden have shown that parents who teach their children their native language first, and the language of the majority of the society they live in, second, have shown that the children learning their native language first have slower development, as they struggle with their ''basic programming'' being in one language, and their environment - in another. You can ''teach'' Latvian by giving them a Latvian environment, speaking to them in Latvian, or sending them to Latvian kindergartens. You do not need to be a teacher.

And, yes, you are paying your taxes and your children, due to the reform, will know Latvian better than they would have if they had studied in a Russian-only school. And this **will help them in life.**

&gt; No, it is not. It is an entirely artificial problem. Not as in ""nonexistent"", bu as in ""man-made"". Made by incompetents and/or politicians. 

What are you talking about? You think shitty Latvian skills of Russian Latvians is not a problem? Are you insane? We have huge swathes of the Latvian population unable to properly work and study because they talk pidgeon Latvian or can only grunt out pleasantries. This is a **huge** problem for someone who wants an integrated society. 

&gt;  Is common sense not enough? Students who went though Russian language school are more or less fluent in three languages - Latvian, Russian and English. Latvian speakers are mostly fluent in two, with the second being usually English. So, who are in better position in the job market *in a counrty where a quarter of population speaks Russian*? 

Excuse me? The reform **enhanced** Latvian skills in students, thereby making Latvian Russians even more competitive in the education and job marketplace. You asserted that this was done to make Latvian Russians less able to compete - but the result was completely otherwise. I ask you a source, first of all, that this was done to make Russian Latvians less competitive, and then - show me proof that this actually happened.",Damn dirty sexy Balts..,/r/europe/comments/bh6r0t/ukraine_tightens_language_law_in_standoff_with/eltelc6/,LatvianLion,1556265616

In EU law, there is a set of crimes for which EU member states are bound to extradite without any need for the accused to meet the bar for double criminality.

*Googles*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Arrest_Warrant#Double_criminality

&gt;Double criminality
&gt;
&gt;Double criminality is a feature of international extradition law by which states may refuse to extradite fugitives if the conduct which is alleged to have constituted a criminal offence in the state requesting extradition would not have resulted in the commission of a criminal offence in the state being asked to effect the extradition.
&gt;
&gt;Under the EAW Framework Decision, the requirement for double criminality is removed for a wide range of categories of crimes, and made a discretionary rather than a compulsory ground for a refusal to extradite for offences not falling within those categories.
&gt;
&gt;The categories within which are as follows:
&gt;
&gt;* Arson,
&gt;* Computer-related crime,
&gt;* Corruption,
&gt;* Counterfeiting currency,
&gt;* Counterfeiting and piracy of products,
&gt;* Crimes within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court,
&gt;* Environmental crime, including illicit trafficking in endangered animal species and in endangered plant species and varieties,
&gt;* Facilitation of unauthorised entry and residence,
&gt;* Forgery of means of payment,
&gt;* Forgery of administrative documents and trafficking therein,
&gt;* Fraud, including fraud affecting the financial interests of the European Union,
&gt;* Illicit trade in human organs and tissue,
&gt;* Illicit trafficking in cultural goods, including antiques and works of art,
&gt;* Illicit trafficking in hormonal substances and other growth promoters,
&gt;* Illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances,
&gt;* Illicit trafficking in nuclear or radioactive materials,
&gt;* Illicit trafficking in weapons, munitions and explosives,
&gt;* Kidnapping, illegal restraint and hostage-taking,
&gt;* Laundering of the proceeds of crime,
&gt;* Murder, grievous bodily injury,
&gt;* Organised or armed robbery,
&gt;* Participation in a criminal organisation,
&gt;* Racism and xenophobia,
&gt;* Rape,
&gt;* Racketeering and extortion,

3628,"&gt; This absolutely dumbfounds me that this is possible,

US states have mandatory extradition (the legal term being ""interstate rendition"") for *all* crimes between each other.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition_Clause

&gt; A person charged in any state with treason, felony, or other crime, who shall flee from justice, and be found in another state, shall on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime.

My guess is that, ultimately, the EU will probably wind up doing something like that.

&gt; in Poland it’s unconstitutional for the country to extradite its citizens for something which isn’t illegal there,

I dunno what the story is, whether there's an exemption for conflicting constitutions or not.  It's also entirely possible that a conflict between EU law and the Polish constitution exists, but hasn't actually become an issue — Poland's constitution apparently doesn't automatically grant EU law primacy the way some EU member constitutions do.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primacy_of_European_Union_law#Poland

&gt; The Constitutional Tribunal of Poland ruled that while EU law may override national statutes, it does not override the Constitution. In cases of a conflict between EU law and the Constitution, Poland can make a sovereign decision as to how this conflict should be resolved (i.e. by changing the Constitution, leaving the EU or seeking to change the EU law).",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/bgq4es/man_who_was_arrested_via_a_eu_arrest_warrant_for/elt4228/,vokegaf,1556252992

Here I see risks of course, but at the same time, I do not think that without the EU, Germany would necessarily immediately resort to heavy-handed practices. It could but also could not.

But no, of course I do not believe that a German army or whatever other tool of German foreign policy will pursue anything else than German foreign policy. But as I said, I also believe that this is the case already, even with the EU. The EU has very little power in the area of foreign policy and it's unrealistic to think that the member countries would give up this authority.

Ionians originated from Western Anatolia and migrated to Greek mainland around 1,000 BC and they were responsible for Golden Age of Athens and all the great philosphers  of Athens.

3956,"&gt; And you are saying they wanted to become Muslim like it's some sort of spiritual accession.

There are many reasons to become muslim. For example, some people probably thought that compared to Christianity Islam makes much more sense . Frankly even though i'm not a muslim myself, i can see the consistency of Islam. 

And some people converted for economic benefits. Like not paying jizya or inheriting all your family's stuff and leaving nothing to your siblings. Or having a prestigious job like Qadi, etc

Some converted for love. It is not uncommon. It also exists in some Turkish poems. 

Some converted to join the military maybe. Not really uncommon.

3974,"&gt; However, if you're faced with a tough situation, like say a heart transplant, do you want to force the obese person to get on a treadmill or fix the patient? The treadmill does not help at the time. No matter what you do, it's going to suck, but ideally you handle it in the responsible way right?

Sure. But the way I see it, there is no surefire way to 'heal Greece'. It's not a problem you can point to and say 'this is why, let's fix this'. It's a system that has been present since practically forever. If this is Greece's actual natural state (and I'm not saying it is), then we cannot artificially prop it up to a standard its people would deem acceptable. It'd be unfair.

&gt; Greece is stuck in a trap where their income is too high relative to their productivity and their debt repayments/total debt is too high relative to their income. Austerity is cutting their spending, but unfortunately that's someone elses incomes and their incomes are dropping quicker than their ability to repay their debt on the current track. It's not working. This isn't theoretical anymore. The austerity has been going on for 10 years.

But isn't austerity just living within your means? Because you cannot borrow loans, you cannot overspend. And even then, were Greece to borrow loans and repeal austerity, where is the growth? What will earn the state the money back? You can't prop up exporters, because there are none large enough to make a difference. Greece is unfortunately on the edge of Europe, unlike CEE, so it cannot benefit there - so what are the prospects? What has historically Greece done that was a successful moneymaker? I'm not saying there was nothing, but nothing comes to my mind, at least. 

It is the popular thing to overstaff and overpay government employees because that's a guaranteed vote, but you cannot cut taxes (or outright not collect them), raise goverment salaries, borrow money to pay for it all and expect all this not to eventually catch up to you. That time is now.

&gt; In my opinion, Greece is straight up bankrupt and it'd be wise to just accept that and try to put them on a sustainable path. That doesn't mean give them carte blanche to do what they want. It's a spectrum.

Hypothetically, let's accept they are bankrupt. But what can change? They won't leave the Euro, frankly they don't even want to because they know what kind of disaster that would be. They can't borrow more money because nobody's insane enough to lend them any and then what's the difference here? If we cut their debts, at best we let them keep their interest payments (which are already low as is), but the confidence is already gone and the stigma remains. 

&gt; If that's the case, there needs to be a mechanism to get their income to debt repayments ratio in line. Otherwise this will never end, and yes, there will be more debt bailouts. Or the Euro will end. However, if you never solve that problem in the 1st place, then yea, you can blame the bad handling of the debt by the EU for never solving the problem. Their negotiators like Dijsselbloem are quite frankly unreasonable. Smart people like Larry Summers agree with me so it's not just the Greeks being greedy.

Once again. I don't know, it may be that forgiving Greece's debt in entirety will bring about a golden age where a Greek government sponsored scientist discovers nuclear fission and a random Greek diplomat brokers eternal peace in the middle east, but the issue is a political hot potato. And which German or Polish or Czech politician would risk his career so that the Greeks can be better off? Ultimately, you need the council to agree, and that's where the proposal is guaranteed to fail.

&gt; Ideally Greece could have a balance of debt write offs, wealth transfers from rich Greeks, austerity, and money printing by the ECB. Generally countries that have balanced inflationary and deflationary forces like that have deleveraged less painfully and more effectively than the pure austerity route.

The wealth transfer from rich Greeks is as likely as Theresa May remaining PM post Brexit. A nice idea, but a fantasy all the same. And I'm not sure if the ECB isn't too autonomous to simply do what it's told. Not to mention that it would hurt the Euro, and therefore the Eurozone disproportionately to other EU members. Which is another difficult topic that just wouldn't fly in my opinion.

&gt; The productivity to income ratio is a harder problem to solve, but at a minimum, if there's no Fiscal Transfers to alleviate the issue, Northern Countries are going to have to be more diligent about giving out debt and export less to them too. Generally both sides take on the risk when debt is given out after all. I agree that may mean the Greeks need to consume less too, but you can't address that issue while the larger looming issue of the unpayable debt is still on the table.

I reiterate my earlier point. Suppose we cross off the Greek debt, then what? How will Greece get back on its feet? Another round of loans? Do you see a light at the end of this tunnel, because I really don't. If the Greek economy has perspective for high growth, then it's currently enjoying a very favourable long term low interest loan from the EU. It should be performing far better than it has thus far. And if it needs more borrowed money to function, then where's the guarantee that we won't be back at the same place 20 years down the road from now?

It's a bullshit comparison because it gives you, and other equally shallow individuals, the impression that you have a base when in fact your focus should be somewhere else.

Or maybe they were blatantly false, or ""fake news"", or ""project fear"". I used to push these apocaliptic predictions everywhere I had the chance and frankly reality was the biggest eye opener. I was very surprised when things were much better that I myself was saying.

	An upmarket Sofia neighbourhood has become the focus of anti-corruption campaigners who are probing how a group of prominent Bulgarian politicians and state officials were able to purchase luxury apartments at knockdown prices.

The scandal, dubbed “apartmentgate”, has infuriated ordinary Bulgarians who normally shrug off corruption as an inevitable part of life in the EU’s poorest member state.

“If we’d revealed price-fixing in a public procurement project such as a highway, people wouldn’t have taken much notice,” says Nikolay Staykov, a co-founder of the Anti-Corruption Fund. “But middle-class Bulgarians struggling to pay a mortgage on a small city apartment are deeply resentful that politicians were able to buy luxury homes so cheaply.”

The US-backed group was the first to expose details of properties acquired at a fraction of the market price by senior members of the ruling GERB (Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria) party of Prime Minister Boyko Borisov.

The fund’s discoveries were published on its website last month and quickly went viral on social media.

Tsetska Tsacheva, the justice minister, stepped down while GERB’s powerful deputy chairman Tsvetan Tsvetanov resigned his parliamentary seat, plunging the party into turmoil. Two deputy ministers also stepped down. All four had bought luxury apartments in the Iztok neighbourhood at cheap prices.

The head of the state anti-corruption commission, Plamen Georgiev, who acquired an apartment in another wealthy Sofia neighbourhood, allegedly under-reported the size of his apartment to the tax authorities. He was told by the premier to take indefinite leave while his case was investigated. The four politicians and Mr Georgiev have all denied wrongdoing.

Several senior officials including judges and a prosecutor and former ministers in GERB’s right-of-centre government were revealed by Bivol, another investigative group, and BTV, a private television channel, to have bought apartments below the market price.

Bulgaria’s prosecutor-general has launched an official investigation into the purchases. All those involved in these allegations have also denied wrongdoing",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bhcxv9/bulgarias_apartmentgate_infuriates_struggling/elrsqq7/,trimamukanti,1556221546

	The scandal threatens to scupper GERB’s chances of winning an outright victory in next month’s European parliamentary elections. Mr Borisov has distanced himself, saying he was “furious” over the property purchases. But his approval rating has fallen to 28 per cent according to Alfa, a Sofia pollster.

The sheer number of GERB politicians involved and the luxury of their apartments have shocked the public. Property prices are a hot topic among Bulgaria’s new middle class as Sofia experiences a residential building boom driven by strong population growth and a strengthening economy.

Moving out of their bleak Soviet-era apartment blocks that ring the city centre is a priority for many families.

“From what we saw of these buildings on television, they were suitable for rich Middle Easterners . . . way beyond anything a Bulgarian professional could dream of,” said Dimitar, a software engineer.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bhcxv9/bulgarias_apartmentgate_infuriates_struggling/elrsteb/,trimamukanti,1556221593

	“Apartmentgate” has also undermined Mr Borisov’s hopes of persuading his EU peers to remove a special monitoring mechanism aimed at reducing corruption in Bulgaria and Romania, which was imposed when the neighbours joined the union in 2007.

Lack of progress in combating graft prevents both Bulgaria and Romania from joining the EU’s Schengen programme for visa-free travel in the union. In Transparency International’s annual corruption perceptions index Bulgaria, Romania and Greece rank lowest among the EU’s 27 members.

“GERB’s image in Europe will suffer even though the government is likely to weather this crisis,” said Mois Faion of the Centre for the Study of Democracy, a Sofia think-tank. “But this [scandal] will not easily be forgotten — it touches every Bulgarian. People can compare their financial capacity directly with that of the top leaders and realise how enormous the gap is.”

Anti-corruption groups are investigating reports by local media alleging that politicians from the Bulgarian Socialist party also acquired cut-price apartments in upmarket neighbourhoods while they were in office.

Stefan, a computer specialist who returned from the US to set up his own company in Sofia, expressed the frustration felt by many Bulgarians. “Something’s wrong with our political system if ministers and judges get access to luxury accommodation without paying the going price. It seems to be a benefit that comes with the job,” he said.

Mr Staykov’s team of investigators uncovered the controversy when they compared figures reported in the annual declarations of personal wealth made by MPs and high state officials with the official register of property purchases in Sofia, and property sales in the Iztok district.

In particular they scrutinised sales made by Arteks Engineering, a high-end Sofia construction company.

“At the very least, accepting the discount was unethical behaviour by the politicians,” said Mr Staykov. “It also makes them vulnerable to accusations of capture by special interests. And if the value of the purchase was under-declared, this raises questions about fraud and possible tax evasion.”

The sales took place last year after the government pushed through a law extending building permits that had already expired. These included Arteks’ licence to build a luxury tower block in Iztok, which expired in 2016. After the scandal broke, the Sofia authorities this month halted construction of the 34-floor building, claiming building regulations were violated.

Arteks denied wrongdoing. A company statement said: “We are perfectionists in planning and carrying out construction work . . . This is why we never needed a push from politicians to help execute our business . . . The political allegiance of our clients is not a priority for us.”",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bhcxv9/bulgarias_apartmentgate_infuriates_struggling/elrsuzh/,trimamukanti,1556221620

Then yes, there should be some austerity, but it should be spread out in an intelligent way. You cut down the debts so their incomes are sufficient to start paying down the debt in a sustainable way. You can stretch it out, lower interest, or lower the amount, whatever.

Then you dont give them as many new loans in the future so this doesn't happen again. If they want to consume more, it will have to manifest itself through productivity growth.

How is that not a reasonable compromise?

&gt;Byzantium took on the name of *Kōnstantinoupolis* (""city of Constantine"", *Constantinople*) after its refoundation under Roman emperor [Constantine I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_I), who transferred the capital of the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire) to Byzantium in 330 and designated his new capital officially as [*Nova Roma*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Rome)(Νέα Ῥώμη) 'New Rome'. During this time, the city was also called 'Second Rome', 'Eastern Rome', and *Roma Constantinopolitana*.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople#cite_note-21) As the city became the sole remaining capital of the Roman Empire after the fall of the West, and its wealth, population, and influence grew, the city also came to have a multitude of nicknames.  
&gt;  
&gt;**As the largest and wealthiest city in Europe during the 4th–13th centuries and a centre of culture and education of the Mediterranean basin, Constantinople came to be known by prestigious titles such as** *Basileuousa* (Queen of Cities) and *Megalopolis* (the Great City) and was, in colloquial speech, commonly referred to as **just** ***Polis*** **(ἡ Πόλις) 'the City'** by Constantinopolitans and provincial Byzantines alike.  
&gt;  
&gt;Modern names of the city\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constantinople&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4)\]  
&gt;  
&gt;**The modern Turkish name for the city,** [***İstanbul***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0stanbul)**, derives from the** [**Greek**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language) **phrase** ***eis tin polin*** **(εἰς τὴν πόλιν), meaning ""(in)to the city"".**[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople#cite_note-23) This name was used in [Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language) alongside *Kostantiniyye*, the more formal adaptation of the original *Constantinople*, during the period of [Ottoman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire)rule, while western languages mostly continued to refer to the city as Constantinople until the early 20th century. In 1928, [the Turkish alphabet was changed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Language_Commission) from Arabic script to Latin script. After that, as part of the 1920s [Turkification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkification) movement, Turkey started to urge other countries to use [Turkish names for Turkish cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_name_changes_in_Turkey), instead of other transliterations to Latin script that had been used in Ottoman times.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople#cite_note-shawn-24)[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople#cite_note-25)[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople#cite_note-26)[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople#cite_note-27) In time the city came to be known as Istanbul and its variations in most world languages.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The name ""Constantinople"" is still used by members of the** [**Eastern Orthodox Church**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church) **in the title of one of their most important leaders, the Orthodox** [**patriarch**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenical_Patriarch_of_Constantinople) **based in the city, referred to as ""His Most Divine All-Holiness the Archbishop of Constantinople New Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch.""

You might now now it but Mehmed the 2 had a vision to create a new nation called Ottoman. So, Istanbul was rebuilt, and people from different ethnicity have settled in Istanbul. Churches are preserved, new ones has been built. If you visit Istanbul, you'd see many churches side by side with Mosques. I don't even need to talk about Synagogues. There was an official letter from Cretan people to Ottoman King, they were asking to rebuilt their Church after an earthquake.   


About Izmir, Izmir is also very multi-ethnic, multi-cultural city. As you've mentioned population of Greeks went down, but as you might already know it's due to war between Greece and Ottoman Empire. Independence of Greece begin in 1821. It was a small portion the peninsula at the time, however after some years they were able to control big portion of southern peninsula and some islands. Crete, it's a big island in Med. sea,  was not part of Greece till late 19 century. Maybe you don't know but Greek Revolution/Revolt caused the death of whole Turkish community. You can simply check this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacres_during_the_Greek_War_of_Independence) to get basic information.

&amp;#x200B;

Still huge part of northern Greece was part of Ottoman Empire until Balkan Wars. There was a huge Turkish settlement in Thessaloniki and other cities, however they also faced with same destiny. Comparing to past small percentage of Turks have left in Thrace, however their problems didn't end there. They have faced with cultural assimilation and genocide. They faced racism, they didn't have right to have education in their native language.   


You'd ask me as if Greeks had right to have education in Greek during Ottoman Era. According to this [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcRSa-vH_R0&amp;t=3768s), yes they had the right. And yeah at least Turks still exist in Greece, because there is almost no Turks left in Crete, they also tried to the same in Cyprus.   


Don't get me wrong, I don't hate Greeks and I don't have any problems with them. However on internet some people don't know these things and they spread anti-Turkish hatred.

You are very wrong about this. The problem is that some of you euro fanatics think of the EU as a strictly social-democratic project. Many view that the EU can function like any normal democracy, that it's in constant flux. Right now the left is winning, soon maybe the right is winning. EU can be changed, EU values can change (not that's really a thing). The fundamental value is to function as a block against larger powers.

PiS has been one of the two biggest parties since 2005, when the left collapsed due to Rywingate and as such it's not like Vox or NVA, which grew as alternatives to run-of-the-mill conservative parties and the establishment overall.

&gt; Simply laughing off regressive stuff like this, rather than explaining your reasoning and engaging people, only fuels this feeling of ""the smug liberal ideologue telling you how to live"".

I would say it's the exact opposite - by being outraged, other people feel like we're telling them how to live due to that outrage. This is why PiS officials put out these remarks from time to time - to lead to outrage, which strengthens their base and makes liberals look like morality police all the time.

This is why laughter is the only option. By making fun of what officials say (not of the people themselves, mind you), we can break down the narrative that ""liberals tell you how to live"", people who are not decided politically can laugh with us and hence feel closer to our views and we can pinpoint the ridiculousness of what they say without focusing on us and how we feel. Just take a look at what I did in my first post: instead of being outraged at how the government is insulting towards gay people and pushing young people towards suicide or something like that, I took the literal statement they made (homosexuality threatens survival of the nation) and put it to a logical extreme (buttsex is so powerful it can destroy Poland), therefore making it look silly. And that's the goal: instead of giving it the weight it doesn't deserve, make fun of it.",Warsaw,/r/europe/comments/bh6avv/the_chairman_of_polands_conservative_ruling_party/elriavd/,uelkamewrybady,1556215129

if her native language was basque or galician her accent might have been a bit different than people expected. What languages was she speaking? also keep in mind people can have a difficult time identifying accents if they are not very familiar with X national speaking Y. Recently a twitter ""glamour model"" was accusing a portuguese football player of leaving voice mail dubious messages and published those. And english speakers bought it, I think some media published it even, but everybody portuguese could hear it and it was absolutely not a portuguese person speaking english, not possible. But people from other nationalities would not be able to spot it.

try to figure out what french lettering type means. French use a special ruled notebook when learning to handwrite, wide spaced lines and then lines at 1/4 height, like this https://www.redpandapublishing.com/how-to-use-a-seyes-ruled-book-to-improve-your-handwriting/ and you are supposed to bring some letters to precise heights. Her handwriting could be like that - but that was surely not exclusive of France, I learnt how to write in Portugal in the early 80s using something similar.

Or if she used diacritics, or or an hint of something to do a cedilla, that might be consistent with Spain as well.

and I checked wikipedia, which obviously is not conclusive

Well by WW2-type of situation, I also didn't mean that concentration camps 2.0 would necessarily appear. I meant that Germany would try to control its neighbours through military means (either by using military or threatening to use it) in order to become a hegemon in Europe. Which is btw. not something that you would automatically think if you are a conservative.

Even conservative schools of political sciences/international relations do not necessarily say that offensive strive to a hegemonial position is something states always go for when they can. Specially not if there are other actors in the system who are stronger than you who can punish you for it (the US) or actors of a similar size that can ally against you (other big European countries or groups of smaller countries together).

It just does not make much sense that Germany would want to risk any of this given that it already has an experience that it went badly the last time.

Then there is the risk that 10 years in the future we are doing really badly. The big problem is not that we are doing badly, but how we change it to do better.

4310,"&gt; I would consider Donald Tusk, that toothless idiot Verhofstadt and that drunk Juncker as good examples of shady Eurocrats, aswell as other EU politicians like them that push for further expansion of EU powers and authority.

So Eurocrats is basically not an argument but just an insult for a EU politician.

&gt; Because of Brussels slowly tightening the noose with its ever increasing power and authority causing Swedish sovereignty to be slowly eroded and delegated away until the point of no return has been reached. 

&gt; Or because the EU using member state funds to push for more pro-EU propaganda (especially Swedish money since we're the greatest net payer in the union). It's like subsidizing one's own demise.

&gt; Or because we have some fifth columnists inside the country, mostly the liberals, who in their hubris think that it is a good idea to abolish Swedish independence by being integrated into a European superstate.

Those are just conspiracy theories, sorry. You talk like you're a time traveler from the 1930s. ""tightening the noose"", ""subsidizing one's own demise"", ""fifth columnists want to abolish Sweden"". Your worldview is weird and I cannot understand it because the way you see reality is very different to how I see it. 

The way you use sovereignty or independence is devoid of meaning, as if everyone should just know what it means - the same way it's meaningless when Brexiters use those words. It's just a *feeling*.

Aaand, as I assumed you did in fact make the argument that just because not every Armenian was killed by the genocide it doesn't make it a genocide, nice one. I guess the millions of Armenians who were genocided were just randomly killed for no reason then?

Sure, makes you look bad in that place too, also if you truly believe that European Christian countries don't like Turkey because of what happened centuries ago, then you're delusional.

&gt;I'm done responding to your useless comments because its clear you only think its a genocide because others are saying so.

Yeah, never mind the ethnically targeted Armenians who were slaughtered in the milllions thus being by definition a genocide, I totally believe this not because it's fact but because it's just what everybody else is saying.

Second, you know that doesn't relate to what I was saying. I was saying that your arguement could have been applied to the Armenian genocide as well as the the occupation of Ireland.

And most importantly third. They're might be a minority that justifies it but the majority of the UK population knows it was wrong. Hell we're even taught about all of the wrong in it in history classes.

And fourth let's also not forget that it all started because of king James the 2nd decided to remainin Catholic and fleeing to Ireland to fight against he deposition, where the Catholics were still a majority after the purgings throughout the islands. And he lost that war and the protestants, who were put in power by the winning Dutch protestants, decided to fuck over the Catholics who had been fucking them over for the last few centuries.

I ain't saying any of that was right, but the similarities between these two genocides (potato famine and Armenian) were that of religious, ethnic and score settling nature and inherently wrong.

4543,"Im gonna prefix by saying that I know very little about the Armenian genocide, so I cant really argue about how the facts line up with the requirements set up by international law, but I can offer my two cents in on the law.

Sinply and quickly put: the main issue is whether or not the *intent* of the mass deaths of Armenians was to kill Armenians because they were Armenians. 
Like I said, I dont know a lot about the incident but from what you wrote above, an Ottoman viewpoint could have been ”these Armenians are troublemakers (thanks to foreign interlopers), get rid of them”. 

Its important to note the difference between intent and motivation here. The motivations of the genocide in of themselves, i.e. get rid of these pesky rebels to bring stability and order to the galaxy, is not really relevant as the definition of genocide is:

*”...genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group....” * - Art 2 UN Genocide Convention

With three of the acts refered to being:

*”(a) Killing members of the group;

(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;

(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;”*

It doesnt really matter what the Armenians did to motivate the Ottoman actions or how other groups suffered during the same time. If the Armenians were targeted because they were Armenians and the intent was to destroy (even partially) them, its textbook genocide.

4610,"I'm gonna give you two examples, and one of them will help you see the view of populists voters. You can ignore the other.

1)The rich have multiple avenues to avoid taxes, get punished less for fraud, are more likely to get acquitted in court, and basically have a better life in just about any aspect. That is the status-quo that is currently there. The left-wing populist comes along and tells you that they'll tax the rich to pay for social services, that they'll eliminate fraud completely, etc. Is it such a strange notion to vote for the left-wing populist over the status quo centrist politicians in this case?

2)Companies minimize their costs. This is a fact, and inherent to our capitalist society. Mostly it's a good thing as well, but it does have some drawbacks. One of the ways companies can minimize costs is by outsourcing to countries with lower wage costs. And they do that, and the status-quo politicians basically do everything to put free trade agreements in place, facilitating the outsourcing.

As for why the 80s is most remembered, the fact that the generation that grew up during it would go on to face in the war in their 20s, with many fighting in it, no doubt plays it's part as the nice times before it would stick out more for them, and they tend to be most vocal in the ""remember the old times"" crowd.

The question whether this was a genocide or not also does not hinge on the number of dead or starving Turks or the behavior of the Armenians.

4941,"&gt;Why? is there a need that makes, for example, 5 F-35s better than 7 F-16s? do you have a case analysis?

Your getting more for less. The F-35 absolutely dominates other 4th generation fighters at red flag. With kill ratios of 20:1. It's not a need it's a fact.

&gt;Not everything is the same. For some countries, F-35s may be better.

Countries that are buying the F-16, either aren't allowed to by the U.S or way poorer than even turkey. There is no other answer,  you want the F-35 if you're a NATO partner or a close ally. The only real obstruction, would be if a country just wants pure numbers and doesn't care about quality.

https://www.google.com/search?q=romania+f-35&amp;oq=romania+f-35&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.6083j0j4&amp;client=ms-android-mpcs-us-revc&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8


&gt;Is there a particular use case in Greece that justifies the purchase of F-35s? I am no analyst, but from what I know so far, there is no need for such advanced weaponry.

Today, remember that the battlefield changes and countries want a platform that can also adapt to future demands. Buying planes just for today's battle space is foolish. We can't predict the future, but an advanced weapon gives you more coverage than the alternative.

&gt;The probability of an important enough war with an enemy that is at the position to fight with Greece in such a way that F-35s would give Greece a victory and F-16s will not is extremely small.

The chance of Greece going up against any is small. So why have an air Force at all? We have armed forces because we assume a worst case scenario. You'd get the F-35 because you also assume a worst case scenario. Let's not forget that Greece might be called upon helping another NATO ally, which does have a higher chance of being attacked. Greece would have a better chance defending an ally with the F-35. In such a scenario the F-35 can communicate more fluently with other F-35 to strike back against a foe.

The Children ward that has already had children dying due to value engineering that was authorised under the SNP? So are the majority of the hospitals in Scotland, surely retrofitting and bringing all hospitals in Scotland up to date is better than spunking millions of future taxpayers money of a 'super hospital' that has completely failed? Surely instead of using future taxpayers money to build poorly designed, poor spec, inadequate hospital that was designed in a way that value engineering was placed above the public (IN A HOSPITAL OF ALL PLACES) that has already caused the death of numerous children.

Labour was right, the SNP closed the Paisley childrens ward and told them to go to the Glasgow childrens ward and a year later children are dying in the ""brand new"" childrens hospital due to the SNP incompetence.

Not just getting rid of courses, a whole budget cut on an already failling education sector under the SNP's watch, I genuinely didn't think I could see a government fail as bad as the Tories when tackling education but the SNP have somehow managed to surpass the tories on ruining the education in Scotland and the UK.

Politicians should finally wake up and smell the roses. No one gives a shit about what Guardian writes about you. No one cares if your champagne friends think that you are an asshole. On contrary, it seems that situation actually brings you votes, instead of you loosing them - see Salvini. There needs to be a system, with one singular and simple rule - if you arrive illegaly, you dont get to stay. The only exception should be countries which border EU and **are** in the war and those people have nowhere to flee but EU border. But there is no such right now.

And that doesnt mean that we should not support countries who are sheltering refugees currently. After all, we already do that with fuckton of money that could be spent on people living in poverty in EU. Not that EU gets any thanks for that. Neither does it mean that we shouldnt take refugees at all, we can and do take them directly from refugee camps where UNHCR registers them and national authorities vet them prior to arrival and when approved give them tickets for plane, place to stay, tutors to teach them language, social worker to help them with settling and getting job and everything in organized manner.

But current system is once again homunculus of yes-but-no approach where no one has guts to go before European population and tell that either A, our borders cannot be crossed without our approval or B, we have open borders, everyone can come and if you dont like it vote me out of office.

5128,"&gt;It's not backtracking, it's literally my statement, and it's a fact: not all voters in Scotland are Scots.
The logic applies to both Leave and Remain voters.

Could of said this in your first post, but you didn't, ergo, backtracking.

&gt;No, I simply realised that you possibly misread my statement. Because it didn't make any sense for you to claim that Scottish expatriates were allowed to vote in the Scottish independence referendum. Because they weren't.
So I decided to clear it out and give you the chance to realise you misread my statement.

No, I, being a Brit, already knew that Scots outside of Scotland were able to vote in the referendum of the EU, and were not in the Independence vote, but you were trying to tie both of those situations together, when you suddenly realised how much of a stupid own goal that was, you edited to make sure you were not called out on it. Just own it man.

&gt;Because that's what made me realise there were such details regarding who got to vote on what in the UK. Which is the reason I corrected you on the Scots/residents distinction to begin with.
My original statement is literally the explanation.

You edited your response because you realised you made a false equivalence of the vote in 2016 to the one in 2014 that I was calling you out on. You being someone who claims to be focused on the details made a glaring omission. 

It's also telling you've ignored me calling out your bullshit when I already told you the centre of the no vote was in Aberdeenshire.

&gt;I think I'm being quite patient in clearing things out, but you seem to become increasingly batshit crazy over nothing, and I'm not really interested in wasting more of my time with that, really.
How hard can it be to acknowledge that you misinterpreted my post? It happens to everybody, including myself.

5277,"The Royal Government has received the communication of the Imperial and Royal Government of the 23rd inst. and is convinced that its reply will dissipate any misunderstanding which threatens to destroy the friendly and neighbourly relations between the Austrian monarchy and the kingdom of Serbia.

The Royal Government is conscious that nowhere there have been renewed protests against the great neighbourly monarchy like those which at one time were expressed in the Skuptschina, as well as in the declaration and actions of the responsible representatives of the state at that time, and which were terminated by the Serbian declaration of March 31st, 1909; furthermore that since that time neither the different corporations of the kingdom, nor the officials have made an attempt to alter the political and judicial condition created in Bosnia and the Heregovina. The Royal Government states that the I. and R. [Imperial and Royal] Government has made no protestation in this sense excepting in the case of a textbook, in regard to which the I. and R. Government has received an entirely satisfactory explanation. Serbia has given during the time of the Balkan crisis in numerous cases evidence of her pacific and moderate policy, and it is only owing to Serbia and the sacrifices which she has brought in the interest of the peace of Europe that this peace has been preserved.

The Royal Government cannot be made responsible for expressions of a private character, as for instance newspaper articles and the peaceable work of societies, expressions which are of very common appearance in other countries, and which ordinarily are not under the control of the state. This, all the less, as the Royal Government has shown great courtesy in the solution of a whole series of questions which have arisen between Serbia and Austria-Hungary, whereby it has succeeded to solve the greater number thereof, in favour of the progress of both countries. 

The Royal Government was therefore painfully surprised by the assertions that citizens of Serbia had participated in the preparations of the outrage in Sarajevo. The Government expected to be invited to cooperate in the investigation of the crime, and it was ready, in order to prove its complete correctness, to proceed against all persons in regard to whom it would receive information. 

According to the wishes of the I. and R. Government, the Royal Government is prepared to surrender to the court, without regard to position and rank, every Serbian citizen for whose participation in the crime of Sarajevo it should have received proof. It binds itself particularly on the first page of the official organ of the 26th of July to publish the following enunciation:

The Royal Serbian Government condemns every propaganda which should be directed against Austria-Hungary, i.e., the entirety of such activities as aim towards the separation of certain territories from the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, and it regrets sincerely the lamentable consequences of these criminal

machinations....

The Royal Government regrets that according to a communication of the I. and R. Government certain Serbian officers and functionaries have participated in the propaganda just referred to, and that these have there fore endangered the amicable relations for the observation of which the Royal Government had solemnly obliged itself through the declaration of March 31st, 1909.... 

The Royal Government binds itself further: 

1. During the next regular meeting of the Skuptschina to embody in the press laws a clause, to wit, that the incitement to hatred of, and contempt for, the Monarchy is to be most severely punished, as well as every publication whose general tendency is directed against the territorial integrity of Austria-Hungary. 

It binds itself in view of the coming revision of the constitution to embody an amendment into Art. 22 of the constitutional law which permits the confiscation of such publications as is at present impossible according to the clear definition of Art. 12 of the constitution. 

2. The Government possesses no proofs and the note of the I. and R. Government does not submit them that the society _Narodna_ _Odbrana_ and other similar societies have committed, up to the present, any criminal actions of this manner through any one of their members. Notwithstanding this, the Royal Government will accept the demand of the I. and R. Government and dissolve the society _Narodna_ _Odbrana_, as well as every society which should set against Austria-Hungary.

3. The Royal Serbian Government binds itself without delay to eliminate from the public instruction in Serbia anything which might further the propaganda directed against Austria-Hungary provided the I. and R. Government furnishes actual proofs of this propaganda.

4. The Royal Government is also ready to dismiss those officers and officials from the military and civil services in regard to whom it has been proved by judicial investigation that they have been guilty of actions against the territorial integrity of the Monarchy; it expects that the I. and R. Government communicate to it for the purpose of starting the investigation the names of these officers and officials, and the facts with which they have been charged. 

5. The Royal Government confesses that it is not clear about the sense and the scope of that demand of the I. and R. Government which concerns the obligation on the part of the Royal Serbian Government to permit the cooperation of officials of the I. and R. Government on Serbian territory, but it declares that it is willing to accept every cooperation which does not run counter to international law and criminal law, as well as to the friendly and neighbourly relations.

6. The Royal Government considers it its duty as a matter of course to begin an investigation against all those persons who have participated in the outrage of June 28th and who are in its territory. As far as the cooperation in this investigation of specially delegated officials of the I. and R. Government is concerned, this cannot be accepted, as this is a violation of the constitution and of criminal procedure. Yet in some cases the result of the investigation might be communicated to the Austro-Hungarian officials. 

7. The Royal Government has ordered on the evening of the day on which the note was received the arrest of Major Voislar Tankosic. However, as far as Milan Ciganovitch is concerned, who is a citizen of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and who has been employed till June 28th with the Railroad Department, it has as yet been impossible to locate him, wherefore a warrant has been issued against him. 

The I. and R. Government is asked to make known, as soon as possible for the purpose of conducting the investigation, the existing grounds for suspicion and the proofs of guilt, obtained in the investigation at Sarajevo. 

8. The Serbian Government will amplify and render more severe the existing measures against the suppression of smuggling of arms and explosives. 

It is a matter of course that it will proceed at once against, and punish severely, those officials of the frontier service on the line Shabatz-Loznica who violated their duty and who have permitted the perpetrators of the crime to cross the frontier.

9. The Royal Government is ready to give explanations about the expressions which its officials in Serbia and abroad have made in interviews after the outrage and which, according to the assertion of the I. and R. Government, were hostile to the Monarchy. As soon as the I. and R. Government points out in detail where those expressions were made and succeeds in proving that those expressions have actually been made by the functionaries concerned, the Royal Government itself will take care that the necessary evidences and proofs are collected. 

10. The Royal Government will notify the I. and R. Government, so far as this has not been already done by the present note, of the execution of the measures in question as soon as one of those measures has been ordered and put into execution. 

The Royal Serbian Government believes it to be to the common interest not to rush the solution of this affair and it is therefore, in case the I. and R. Government should not consider itself satisfied with this answer, ready, as ever, to accept a peaceable solution, be it by referring the decision of this question to the International Court at The Hague or by leaving it to the decision of the Great Powers who have participated in the working out of the declaration given by the Serbian Government on March 18/31st, 1909.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/bgwwjv/the_serbian_response_to_the_austrohungarian/elo9thd/,Prinz_von_Preussen,1556127787

5291,"&gt;The only region of Ukraine officially recognized as occupied by the country itself is Crimea IIRC.

The only reason why Donbass is not considered an occupied region is simple - Russia hasn't yet officially claimed its theirs. Yet in every aspect of everyday life it is the definition of an occupied region - it is controlled by Russian army and its leaders (especially military) are sent directly from Russia. 
&gt;Providing a civilian service in an occupied area was an act of decency rather than war last time I checked. Occupation is an act of war.

I have a feeling, you have no idea what ""civil service"" means. Dishing out your passports is not civil service. It's trying to assert control over the region. It's life saying Deash in Syria simple tried to provide ""civil service"" in regions they once held. 

&gt;This is a change in Russian domestic policy, in the rules that apply within the country. Is a country not at liberty to change its own stance on immigration?
Because this decision directly correlates with foreign policy and is purely motivated by one desire - trying to strengthen a claim on other country's territory.

It takes naïvety and ignorance to fall for their lies, especially to fall for them *repeatedly*. If there was a party with a plan to solve these problems, I would not be complaining, but there isn't, and the populists are perhaps the worst suited of all to do so. They have only made everything worse. To fall for them once is forgivable, but to continuously support them indicates either denial, extreme ignorance of politics and the world around onself or a criminal lack of patriotism, to the point of wishing the ruin of one's own nation.

Naturally the best way to take away their niche is by making sure all is well, but populists hinder constructive parties in making progress towards any sort of improvement. Indeed that's what they should be doing, because what they care about is power, and fixing their core issues would remove their raison d'etre, along with any power they might have.

So then we arrive at the best option of all, the prevent any and all crises before they even happen. Ensure that society is always utopian. I'm sure you can see that this is quite impossible. There will always be ups and downs. Sometimes an entire state, particularly if it's on the smaller side, cannot do anything, because global trends are often large and practically unstoppable.

It's not mere stubbornness as you try to present it. It's a question of paramount importance to all Armenians. In no world will we agree to open borders with 2 openly hostile countries in exchange for Artsakh. That's madness. 

I live in Armenia and I'm doing perfectly fine. Things will get even better as time goes by. 

&gt; A solution would be in the interest of all the neighboring countries.

Of course. A solution can be reached if both sides try to actually negotiate. That's not happening now.

&gt; Also Azerbaijan is buying weapons left and right with their oil money. I would say it does not look good for any upcoming conflict.

Local military arsenal has also been significantly updates over the past 2 years. Slightly superior weaponry decides next to nothing in all-out open warfare.

&gt; What is far more so is that such leaders have been emerging in well-established democracies.

&gt; Some are longstanding democracies; others, again, are not.

Then he claims Russia, Turkey, India, Brazil, Venezuela, Philippines, Italy are all some sort of stable democracies that are now faltering. Russia has never been a democracy before 1991 and since then has had only three presidents, if I'm not mistaken, one of which (Medvedev) was a puppet. Turkey's democracy was started by a military dictator that forcefully secularized a thoroughly Islamic country and at gunpoint got the Turks to renounce the Islamism and left the military of all the institutions as guardians of that secularism. And so on. 

While it is true that Trump is unstable and unfit to be the president, if anything his elections should be a sigh of relief for anyone worried about American institutions as defenders of democracy. His entire presidency has been him thinking he can do whatever he wants now that he's president and him getting slapped down by the institutions, really, other than the questionable electoral college, his presidency is a grand affirmation of the American institutions. He also, for all the fear mongering, hasn't actually followed nazi or fascist playbook at all, hasn't really attempted to mess up the American democracy any more than it already is on the account of the two party system. 

&gt; If such a leader wishes to subvert democracy, it is, alas, not that hard to do,

As proven by the fact that Trump now has unlimited mandates, unlimited judicial, legislative and executive power concentrated in his person, his wall built, Muslims banned, citizenship law changed and all the illegal immigrants kicked out. Oh wait...

	The answer has two parts. One is the strength of the fear and anger. This is partly due to longstanding economic failures, partly to the financial crisis and partly to cultural changes. The other answer is the willingness of parts of the elite to exploit such emotions, to achieve huge tax cuts and eliminate regulation. I have called this approach “pluto-populism”. It can also be seen as the strategy of racial division used by the old elites of the US South, but modernised and applied to nation as a whole.

This is a lot of words to say nothing. Here's a fun fact: economic policy of the mainstream Democratic and Republic party from circa 1980 to circa 2016 did not differ one bit, they were both neo liberals that wanted free trade, to outsource everything and mass immigration to get the workers needed. Main difference is Republicans didn't want to give immigrants much rights and Democrats wanted to give immigrants all the rights but otherwise they both agreed immigrants were good and needed. Republican party has had a strong nativist wing since the 80s so they paid lip service to the idea of closing the borders or kicking the illegals out but they want the immigrants as much as Democrats do, that is the mainstream Republicans did. The idea that Republicans are the only party of large corporations is nonsense, find me once corporation that is against mass immigration and, in the last decade or so, most of the largest and most influential giant corporations are largely progressive as well, because the dirty secret is identity politics sell well. Google, Amazon, Nike with the sports hijab, basically the entire tech and banking industries. Republicans are a party of few specific industries that are failing or unpopular, like coal or oil, that need government support and protection, but Democrats are the technocrats representing most of the wealthiest corporations.",,/r/europe/comments/bgszr8/the_age_of_the_elected_despot_is_here_people_want/elny8dh/,nrrp,1556120871

5432,"Bulgarian European Commissioner Mariya Gabriel’s brother, Boris Nedelchev, has managed to acquire a big apartment in Sofia. He has made a very profitable deal with the company “Bigla 3”, which is close to the country’s rulers. The deal has generated a big profit for Nedelchev in just three years. In fact, his apartment turned out free. At the time of these property deals, Gabriel had been using cheap municipal housing for BGN 400 per month, which in seven years had saved her nearly BGN 80,000 that she did not declare to the European Parliament.

“The housing development “Dianabath Residence” is located on “Pimen Zografski” Str. in the “Dianabath” district, in a quiet, safe, serene and yet accessible location, with built infrastructure, close to a school, a day care, a subway station and surrounded by many parks,” this is how the owner of the construction company “Bigla 3” advertises one of its many projects in the elite “Iztok” district of Sofia. The prices there are on average about EUR 1,000 per square meter.

For a common citizen to buy a decent home in such a development, they have to have a minimum of EUR 50,000. “Bigla 3” sells its finished apartments at similar market rates. Boris Nedelchev, however, did not buy in 2014 a finished unit, but a “right to build” for an apartment of 82 square meters. The declared price is BGN 39,000 or EUR 237 per square meter. In the following 2015, Nedelchev exchanged the apartment for a larger one – 96.94 square meters, for which he paid “Bigla 3” BGN 32,000. On September 19, 2016, the exchange was entered in a notary deed, in which additional material interest was not declared. Thus, according to documents, the apartment cost Nedelchev the almost symbolical amount of BGN 71,000.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bgvq44/company_gives_free_apartment_to_bulgarian/elnye8m/,trimamukanti,1556120970

5434,"**Politicians call one-child policy proposal hypocritical and totalitarian**

Danish scientists propose a model in line with the chinese, where from 1979 to 2015 it was only allowed to have one one child.

There is no political backing for the danish scientists' wish that a string of countries around the world introduce a one-child policy to help fight climate change.

""The problem is huge. Therefore you should, in the countries where there are a lot of young people, introduce a one-child policy like in China. It can help prevent, that it becomes unfixable (literally, he says ""that it goes completely wrong"")."" professor Jørgen E. Olesen from Aarhus University commented to Jyllands-Posten.

He has received support from two other danish scientists, climateprofessor Eigil Kaas from Copenhagen University and Kaj Sand-Jensen who is a professor of fresh water ecology at Copenhagen University.

""It is simply the most hypocritical thing I have ever heard"" says Søren Espersen, the foreign affairs spokesperson from Dansk Folkeparti.

**Tweet:** ""These climate researchers must have eaten nails. Never in life will free western peoples bend to the sick ideas, that have been gotten from Communist-China. I propose instead: Have a lot of children! I have 5 myself, and would very much like to have had more!""

Liberal Alliance's Joachim B. Olsen is not excited about the idea either.

""It is a symptom of (literally, he says it is ""an expression of"" but not sure if that translates well), that in this climate debate, there is an undercurrent of something totalitarian. It comes from people thinking, that we stand on the edge of humanity's extinction, but of course we don't. We face a climate-related challenge, and it can be handled. The idea that we have use totalitarian methods methods to solve it, is simply hogwash."" says Joachim B. Olsen to Berlingske.

The left is not excited about the idea either - but Søren Egge Rasmussen, climate spokesperson for Enhedslisten, is not entirely dismissive.

""Shall we then have a one-child policeforce, that travels around and ensures that the law is upheld? If you have more than one child, then what do we do? How will you enforce it? Will you forcefully sterilise men? I think, that there is a lot of ethics in this dilemma, that you have to work out before it can be implemented."" he said to Berlingske.

**""There is a lot that isn't realistic""**

But according to Jørgen E. Olesen it is important to discuss the proposal, even though it isn't immediately realistic, he says in an interview with Ritzau.

""There is a lot that isn't realistic. This is not realistic, because we have unfathomably poor governmental leadership and among others things religion, which also obstructs it. (literally, he used a metaphor of somebody stretching out their leg to trip others up) It is probably only realistic in countries and states with a very strong government. China has this, so maybe it can only happen there.


""It is really hard in democracies and in countries where religion plays a large role, because it is often against the nature of religion, because it has a strong focus ethical questions and the rights of the individual, which also exists in democracries. What can/might be realistic, is that you start discussing it, so that governments, states and religions at the least doesn't support having large amounts of children (literally, he says ""doesn't support a large child flock."")

*One-child policies go against the right to form a family and have children. What weighs the heaviest - consideration for the community or the individual?*

""It is a hard ethical dilemma between individual and communal consideration. I think, that with the crises we face, that the community must weight very heavily here.""",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/bgtk6s/some_danish_climate_researches_have_just/elnyfig/,Varnarok,1556120992
5435,"One more year passed, and at the end of 2016, the new homeowners, Boris Nedelchev and his wife, sold the same apartment for BGN 180,000 – bingo! The family came out of the fast real estate deals with over BGN 100,000 in net profit.

Several months earlier, they bought an apartment of 100 square meters in another neighborhood for BGN 100,318. Simple math shows that the profits from the “Dianabath” apartment have completely covered this purchase.
We must point out here that the builder “Bigla 3” has given the right to build in this building only to the brother of Mariya Gabriel and no one else. All other apartments have been sold finished, at prices that match the market ones. In addition, there are no mortgage entries in the Property Register in the name of the brother and sister-in-law of the European Commissioner. They have paid cash for the right to build, and then for the profitable exchange.
It is hard to find a logical explanation why “Bigla 3” had extended such a huge financial gesture to this family. However, there is one very interesting fact in “Bigla’s” real estate entries that attracted our attention.

A trick once again with Sofiiski Imoti (Sofia Properties)…

The “Bigla 3” company has also been involved with the Sofia Municipality, which, as we know, in the last 12 years has been permanently run by Gabriel’s party, Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) and has provided to her a cheap municipal apartment.

In 2013, “Bigla 3” and Boyan Boyanov bought from the Sofia Municipality attributable parts of land plots with a total area of 514 square meters. The municipal plots have apparently been listed as salable after a change in the regulation plan and have shaped the “Dianabath” terrains where “Bigla 3” has built an entire neighborhood, including Nedelchev’s apartment building.

There is no information on the sale price, but considering the registration fee of BGN 332 (which is 0.1% of the material interest) it should be EUR 165,000. This is nearly three times cheaper than the average price for such properties at that time, while in 2013 similar plots had been selling at the head-spinning prices of more than EUR 1 million, according to the statistics by the site imot.bg.

We searched for information on the company, one of the largest in the industry. We asked who could tell us about the particular deal with Nedelchev in 2014 and the secretary gave us the phone number of the marketing director Ivan Angelov. We contacted Mr. Angelov and asked him if he remembered this special client Boris Nedelchev and the right to build. Angelov could not remember but said that if he would decide to provide this information to us, he would get in touch. We sent him the details of the deal via text message, but we did not receive any reply. We could not find Mariya Gabriel’s brother, nor his wife for comment.

What is “Bigla 3”?

Krassimir Shalev, who is also behind the investment company “Shalev Investment Group”, is the owner of “Bigla 3”. The company is one of the largest in the industry and in 2016 it won the “Building of the Year” award.

Shalev is a partner in “Iris Estates” and “Iris Trade” with Hristo Angelkov, the husband of current GERB Minister of Tourism, Nikolina Angelkova.

A consortium with the participation of “Bigla 3” won in 2011 the tender for the major overhaul of the National Museum of Bulgarian Fine Arts (the former Prince’s Palace). The amount is BGN 2.4 million. However, according to an audit of the Ministry of Culture, published by Bivol, the assigned works had been poorly executed and the contractor and the designer had inflicted damages to the State with poor repair activities that the construction supervision had, nevertheless, approved.

On its own or in various consortia, “Bigla 3” has won public procurement for over BGN 13 million, shows a reference to the Public Procurement Register. As is well known, one of the distinctive features of GERB’s rule is that it distributes public procurement exclusively to companies close to the party’s leadership.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bgvq44/company_gives_free_apartment_to_bulgarian/elnyfm0/,trimamukanti,1556120994

Because no other country needs to do so. 

&gt; Russia doesn't, the UK doesn't, the US doesn't, Spain doesn't, the many other countries with atrocities and genocides in their past don't do this when commemorations and monuments, change of holiday names, bringing down statues of yesteryear heroes to erect those of victim groups, you name it...

Because there are no such stuff for their genocides, aside from some weak and irrelevant ones no one cares.

It's like saying there is acrocities against Buddhists in a region without Buddhists or maybe with dozens of them.

&gt; You viewing the Turkish case as the norm is seriously warped and is not inline with the reality of how the rest of the world works.

Rest of the world wouldn't work differently than Turkey as we can see from Japan. Russia wasn't that different when it came to the little fuss around Sochi Olympics.

&gt; Wrong analogy. Can you point to a case where a group of Ukrainian diaspora tried to raise such a commemorative memorial in Armenia and that it was institutionally disallowed with or without external pressure? Never mind that there is no Ukrainian diaspora in Armenia. So unless and until you can find such an example let's not speculate, specially since Armenia is a democracy right now and its *internal* affairs are its own.

My exact point: there are no such cases where genocide commemoration statues being erected. Oh there is something near to that with Japan and we know how these end up.

&gt; Definitely not in the Armenian case. Well, you better start getting an understanding of the nature of the Armenian Genocide worldwide denial which was in effect until very recently, because sincerely I feel you are not aware of what has been happening. Armenians *were silenced* and it wasn't actually until some went overboard with terrorist acts where the issue was brought back to light.

If you're not referring to USSR silencing them, they weren't silenced but ignored and not backed and opposed since Turkey was important by then.

&gt; Armenians tried and tried and they were blocked and blocked, everywhere, even in Armenia SSR.

Not surprising considering Kremlin did those to any group and about any genocide including rewriting the history.

The idea that journalists operate in some perfectly neutral paradigm is a fantasy. You can just observe the world around you and confirm this truth for yourself.

5623,"&gt; In any way, it's more about Turkey not being as powerful and as relevant as Russia for other countries to not even dare to think about recognising its genocides.

That's exactly how it has been until the fall of the Soviet Union. The liberal west backed Turkey to the point of silencing the Armenian Genocide. The Soviet Union itself also did the same. It was a politically silenced genocide to the point where even academia was encouraged to silence it. The first recognitions in the west really started in the 1990s - I believe only two were before that, Cyprus and Uruguay. Academia of course has already set the record straight.

It is worth reiterating that these recognitions are political in their nature and they exist because of the massive denial which has also always been *rooted in politics*, spearheaded by Turkey but also backed by the US, UK and others.

5686,"first of, there is a slight difference between muslim and turk, and secondly, not that i am the most educated person to history, but even though a lot of muslims died in balkans from liberation wars, there were never millions of deaths, monst people just fled, and the crime was not organized as ottomans and turkish governments actively and completely conciously did. finally, peoples exchange is not ethnic cleansing by the meaning hundrets of thousands of people diying and getting forgotten aka genocide.

for example, during the greek liberation war, supposedly, after the siege of tripolitsa, a city that housed thousands of muslims, they all 'vanished', now, i am not sure that there can be actual and objectice historic concencuses about their numbers, nonetheless, thousands of muslims died there, thats a crime closer to genocide, though i am not sure what 'makes' a genocide. things are triky because its a law term, not just an everyday word. but also, some hundret thousands of muslims left greece during population exchange in the 20s, thats not a genocide or anything close to it, its unfair but it wa an agreement between governments.

also, after the siege of tripolitsa, there was no greek goverment and there was not an organized plan to cleanse every square km of land of muslims by any official government, thats hugely different that the organized plan of the ottoman and turkish governments themselfs.",,/r/europe/comments/bglt40/today_24_april_is_the_armenian_genocide/eln6u2u/,cupid91,1556098960

5693,"How does he do good job? 

His first critique: Ana never mentions the name 'Young Turks' as being responsible for the genocide. According to him because their network is named the same. According to him it's the same as talking about the Holocaust and not mentioning the Nazis. How is that relevant? Why does that even matter? She (Ana) also explains how the name of TYT Network has nothing to do with the group that was behind the genocide as a 'Young Turk' is something else entirely, namely 'a young person eager for radical change to the established order.'. So again, what would his point be there? 

His second point: he takes parts of a video from 2013 and makes the claim that Ana does not want to argue with Cenk about it because he still denies it. There is no evidence of that in that video. I've seen the full clip, not this highly edited version of 'Nuancebro'. I will agree that Cenk is a bit on a high horse in that video, but nowhere does he still deny it. For someone called 'Nuancebro' he sure is not being nuanced at all and is taking small snippets of video taken out of their context to prove his 'points'. 

His third point is about Cenk rescinding his statements from the past and stating that he 'is not a scholar of history' and that he is 'going to refrain from commenting on the Armenian Genocide, which I clearly do not know enough about'. He says he does not call it an Armenian Genocide , when Cenk CALLS IT THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE IN THE BLOGPOST THAT HE, Nuancebro, QUOTES. I put that in caps just to make it extra clear. Another bs point. 

His fourth point is that in a clip Cenk says the Armenians were 'being sent out of their country' instead of being killed and that somehow he is therefore renaming genocide to fit his (Cenk) narrative. How? Armenians were sent out of their country, into the desert in death marches. That is something that they mention in that video themselves as well. Within the context of the original video that Ana is showing in her video is makes complete sense. 

His final point is also again a critique on their name. I understand how people might find the name inappropriate, but I've already shown how the meaning behind 'Young Turks' is not just a reference to the political party, but to a person that wants change. Nuancebro also goes try and make a point that TYT Network reappropriated the term Young Turks. Untrue. How would he even know? Also, as you can see [here](https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/young-turk.html), the term Young Turk(s) has been used a lot in the past way before Cenk was even born, let alone before he founded TYT.

I wasn't going to, but I actually took the time to watch that video and honestly it does not do a good job at all. What do people want from Cenk at this point? How him to shout it off the rooftops that he believes in the Armenian Genocide? People would still criticize him and hate him because of the bias that they have against him. He is not a perfect person and I disagree with his views on plenty of occasions, but this is such a ridiculous issue in an attempt to slander Uygur. There is plenty to actually criticize him on, but at this point the Armenian Genocide thing is not one of them.",,/r/europe/comments/bglt40/today_24_april_is_the_armenian_genocide/eln6vww/,Direksone,1556099030

5751,"The flipside of this coin is that lobbying/legal bribery is also easier on a national level because the amounts of money involved are smaller. So the piece of legislation that you/the people want reversed on a national level can easily be replaced by a piece of legislation written by lobbyists/big corporations. The previous right-wing government here nearly managed to pass a health care reform bill that was in large parts written to serve the interests of large private hospital/clinic-chains from elsewhere in Europe. In fact they would have passed it but it was found unconstitutional because the entirely law-package was a mess, thank gods.

The real problem goes very deep though, and is not uniquely European. Lobbying and lobbyists/'think-tanks' guiding or outright writing legislation is an even bigger problem in the US, and here's the worrying thing: according to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/257337/total-lobbying-spending-in-the-us/), the total amount of money spent on lobbying last year in the US is 3,45 billion dollars. That may seem like a lot, but compared to the size of the US economy and different industries, that's in fact almost nothing. That highlights the big underlining problem: politicians tend to make waaaay less money than wealthy corporations. They're not poor obviously, but compared to big business guys politicians make almost nothing. This also means that from a corporate point of view they're cheap to buy and influence: Facebook spent something like 15-20 million on lobbying the year before, and that's so little for them that it's basically a rounding error. Yet it's still very effective.

Although one has to also account for the fact that the lobbying figures don't contain campaign donations by different groups, which is essentially just another form of lobbying. But the base point remains: people on average are pretty greedy, and politicians are so poor when compared to massive corporations that they're insanely cheap to buy.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/bgrkzn/opinion_next_juncker_must_fix_eus_corporate_power/eln7fq0/,ZenOfPerkele,1556099831

5832,"&gt;Tbf nuclear waste disposal is a genuine issue

Nuclear waste is a solution, not an issue. It's such a non-issue, it can just stay at the plant right next to where it was made. It such a non-issue and so safe, it's not worth the time and money to move it away somewhere else.

Problem: producing energy causes our atmosphere to be polluted, causing millions of people to be sick and live shorter, less healthy lives. Ecosystems, animals and food are polluted too. Capturing this pollution is impossible. We have developed extremely expensive carbon traps and they suck ass at being efficient and will so far don't remove pollutants in high quantities from the atmosphere.

Solution: produce energy in a way that all the pollution is concentrated into a few blocks that occupy less than a football field, instead of being spread ALL OVER EARTH. Material which may kill someone if years from now people *somehow* are unaware of what radiation is, but even then, after one or two people die, they will understand that they need to get the fuck out of this one tiny place. Oh, and does it even make sense to worry for what would happen if some people approached radioactive material storages should the entire society have collapse that people don't even recognize radiation sign which you learn in mandatory schooling? Or perhaps if the scenario already proposes that billions of people have died, it's not really relevant if a few more die? Yeah.
