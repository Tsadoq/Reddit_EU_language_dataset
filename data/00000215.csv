&gt;In the American Mafia, a made man is a fully initiated member of the Mafia…Traditionally, in the Italian-American Mafia, to become a true made man, the inductee had to be a male of full Italian descent…Today, it is believed that the Italian-American Mafia has loosened this requirement so that males of half-Italian descent through their father's line can also be inducted.

And the entire EU and free world for that matter should be in this together. And so whenever the Russians want to sell gas or create pipelines the answer must be a firm no. Poland wants to completely end reliance on Russian oil in the coming years as do the Baltic states. That is progress.

Every week a few were picked up from his friends' circle never to return, and as early as 1941 he writes it was generally known that if you went to these camps, you died.      
      
Klemperer himself was a jew who fell between the cracks of subsequent waves of arrests. He a) was married to a German woman, b) had converted to Protestantism before WWI, c) had served in the German army during WWI and most importantly d) they had no children, so hadn't ""produced mixed offspring"" (families with mixed children were prioritized for the camps). Hitler himself had signed laws giving a special pension to WWI veterans, so Klemperer created a head scratcher for nazi bureaucrats who didn't know how to deal with it, so they always let him go after questioning.

No one complains about freedom, except liberals because freedom of ideas is offensive to them. Which is why the term snowflake is used exclusively for liberals, like you.

 THE 'OLD GENTLEMAN' OF RAAHE -the oldest surviving diving suit in the world.

The best-known item in Raahe Museum is ""the Old Gentleman"", a diving suit from the early 18th century. This rarity was donated to the museum by Captain Leufstadius in 1860s.

The maker of the suit has mastered the latest achievements of the diving technology that made huge progress in the 18th century. The Old Gentleman is therefore regarded as a unique crossover form made from leather in the transition from the diving bell to the actual heavy diving suit.
Made of calf leather

The Old Gentleman is mostly made of cow leather. The seams are sewn with a waxed thread and sealed with pitch. The diving suit was made waterproof by sealing it with a mixture of pork fat, tar and pitch. The hood-shaped head is reinforced from the inside with a wooden framework. In the upper part of the hood is an opening for a wooden air pipe.
Using the suit

The diver wriggled himself into the diving suit through an opening in front of the body, which is closed by pressing the pitched mouth part together. This ""sack mouth"" was rolled on the belt and was attached to the diver's waist. The air was pumped to the diver through wooden pipes that were mutually connected with leather, either using a piston pump or bellows. The air was discharged through a shorter pipe on the backside.

Diving lasted for a short time, since the suit was not completely watertight and could not withstand high pressure. However, the diving suit did offer its user the opportunity of checking the condition of hulls without having to tilt the vessels or to bring them into dry dock.
Made in Finland

The diving suit is presumably of Finnish origin, since the top parts of the boots remind one of the traditional short-shanked boots with laces, while the gloves are similar to those typical of Finnish foresters. A drawing from 1727, discovered in the Admiralty’s material held in the Swedish National Archive, depicts a diving suit that is similar to the Old Gentleman. This drawing has helped to date the time at which the Old Gentleman was manufactured.
Origin of the name

The Old Gentleman visited exhibitions around the world, the last time being at the 1998 World Exposition in Lisbon. Its longest trip was to Philadelphia, in the United States. In connection with the Sea Finland exhibition that was held in London in 1985, the diving suit was playfully nicknamed the venerable Old Gentleman of Raahe, a name by which this gem of the people of Raahe is still known around the world.",,/r/europe/comments/9g7i7t/the_oldest_surviving_diving_suit_in_the_world/e621dwz/,Boozfin,1537067905

https://www.dawn.com/news/1261633

&gt;ISTANBUL: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that family planning and contraception were not for Muslim families, in his latest comments promoting population growth that angered women's activists.
&gt;
&gt;Erdogan said it was the responsibility of mothers to ensure the continued growth of Turkey's population, which has expanded at a rate of around 1.3 per cent in the last few years.
&gt;
&gt;“I will say it clearly... We need to increase the number of our descendants,” he said in a speech in Istanbul.
&gt;
&gt;“People talk about birth control, about family planning. No Muslim family can understand and accept that! As God and as the great prophet said, we will go this way. And in this respect the first duty belongs to mothers.”

https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/world/europe/turkish-premier-calls-for-more-abortion-restrictions.html

&gt;Mr. Erdogan, who wants every married couple to have at least three children, dismissed criticism of his position, saying Friday that abortion “has no place in our values” and on Saturday that “our only goal is to elevate this country above the levels of developed civilizations, for which we need a young and dynamic population.”

I don't much like Erdogan, and I'm sure that simple domestic politics is some of what drives this, but I also believe that he does not want Turkey's fertility to fall through the floor either.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9g4cal/italys_matteo_salvini_provokes_vulgar_outburst/e622aeq/,vokegaf,1537068970

Such as ?

IE, The Russian patriarch is selected by secret voting, same as the Pope

The Patriarch of Romania, also selected by voting.

The Patriarch of Serbia, also selected by voting from members of Holy assembly of Bishops.

The Patriarch of Bulgaria also selected by voting.

Patriarch of Constantinople surprise, surprise, selected by voting.

So tell me where are these plenty of ways ?

Or are you talking about stuff like if patriarch is temporarily incapacitated someone else temporarily takes over ? Because that's absolutely normal.

True enough I can't speak for all orthodox churches and don't know how every single one chooses it's leaders (like the patriarch of Antioch ) but majority of them are by voting.

Saying that the catholic church is ""more democratic"" than orthodox is insane considering that the whole point of the split was mainly papal supremacy. Pope grabbing power.

And saying ""especially orthodox"" is dead wrong also.

455,"&gt; but nothing like the tensions which grew during Obama's second term once Putin returned.

Libya happened. Medvdev going against Putin supported the UN resolution to impose a No Fly Zone in Libya. 

https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/12/09/the-russian-reset-that-never-was-putin-obama-medvedev-libya-mikhail-zygar-all-the-kremlin-men/

&gt; For Putin, Medvedev’s decision not to veto the U.N.’s anti-Libyan resolution was an act of capitulation to Russia’s competitors in the West and thus an act of war against the Russian state. In the aftermath, Putin received a string of reports from the Foreign Ministry and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) about the diplomatic clout Russia stood to lose by betraying Qaddafi. Until then, no one in Putin’s entourage had dared to make any accusations against Medvedev, but now the taboo was lifted.
&gt; 
&gt; Over time, Putin became increasingly irate. When it came to Libya, he began to ignore that foreign policy was the prerogative of the president. “They [NATO] talked about a no-fly zone, so why are Gaddafi’s palaces being bombed every night? They say they don’t want to kill him, so why are they bombing him? What are they trying to do? Scare the mice?” he said on television.
&gt; 
&gt; When Qaddafi was finally killed in October 2011, Putin was apoplectic. Above all, he resented the perfidy of the West. Qaddafi’s problems only began, Putin believes, when he made concessions, confessed his sins, and paid compensation to the relatives of the victims of the Lockerbie bombing. Sanctions were lifted, and he even attended the G-8 summit in 2009 at L’Aquila in Italy (as chairman of the African Union), where he shook hands with Obama. However, his obedience and tractability were soon to be punished. At the very moment when Qaddafi came in from the cold and put his trust in the West, he was stabbed in the back. When he was a pariah, no one had touched him. But as soon as he opened up, he was not only overthrown but also killed in the street like a mangy old cur.
&gt; 
&gt; Putin laid part of the blame for Qaddafi’s murder on Medvedev. The Russian president had been promised by his Western partners that they would simply establish a no-fly zone over Libya to prevent the dictator from bombing rebel positions. And he had gullibly believed them. ",Europe,/r/europe/comments/9g3ewu/putin_and_merkel/e61g7jz/,CoolPrice,1537045013

&gt; Ah, here we go.

You quoted the absolute least important part of my post about a Turkish flyover during an ISIL attack and seized upon one citation needed tag. To say that you're grasping at straws now would be an understatement.

&gt;Firing a few rounds over the border is hardly ""Fighting in Syria"" but perhaps out general definitions are widely different on what constitutes fighting in a country.

I have no information regarding the ferocity of the attack and neither do you. Regardless, no matter how you want to move the goal posts, it still makes your original argument untrue. The YPG **was in fact** an enemy of Turkey, which Turkey engaged with militarily, in 2015 when this British medic was a member. End of story. 

You then lied about the contents of the timeline, falsely claiming it referred to events in Iraq, and when that didn't work you now want to renegotiate the meaning of the word ""fighting."" Twist that and squirm around the wording all you want. You tried to be a condescending dick about something and you were wrong about it. Get over it.

&gt;Turkey fought against the YPG in Syria in 2015? *Interesting.* /s

Yes. Yes they did. This has now been demonstrated to you. Not that what country the fighting took place in even matters.

572,"Wow, this is a great debate to be had, but I don’t think this subreddit can handle it without people being triggered. 

This is my perspective, feel free to debate, but don’t mistake this for some personal attack. I’ve noticed that people talk about how “integration” is more difficult in european states vs the US, but I don’t think that’s true. Our definitions of “integration” are different. For a long time, American society had accepted that entire immigrant communities may be either isolated or culturally distinct from the rest of their city/state, which allows people to feel comfortable in their community, and it places less of an emphasis on total cultural assimilation, but this model can lead to other tension down the road. Especially if social spending and resources are not allocated equally, and institutions of justice aren’t working the same way. 

Being “integrated” in the American way of life, to us, is very basic. Follow the laws, vote, and live an active life. The racial and cultural tension in the US, don’t come from diversity directly, but from our political history which allowed distinctions to evolve within our institutions, which are different according to each community. Police brutality, education funding, housing, and job markets aren’t equally applied or available. We’ve had fierce debates recently, and it may look like a total mess, but it’s getting better. Many police jurisdictions are changing their policy on hiring, and investigations into brutality (ie not using the same DA that handles other cases). Reworking the school system is state by state, and very political, but solutions exist. It’s just going to take time, no generation will completely solve all of our problems, it just slowly gets better over time.

In Europe, I get the sense that this tension is something to be avoided at all costs. And so the idea of “integration” is more of “total cultural assimilation” or else you shouldn’t expect life to be easy. That’s an easy philosophy to have, but it’s an impossible standard for immigrants to reach. Diversity will lead to tension, but with proper planning, civil democratic debate, reflection, and honesty; you can definitely make progress.

Edit: One of the guys in the video brought up the concept of “whiteness,” which always gets ridiculed on this thread for some reason. In America, it’s a pretty nuanced idea. It’s not so much even about skin color, it’s more about the way society sees different ethnicities, through profiling, history, anecdotes and media stereotypes. There’s a Supreme Court case about Harvard’s admission policies which factor in ethnic background to get a more thorough understanding of applicants, the plaintiffs are Asian Americans, who argue that they are being most negatively impacted by this affirmative action. This has sparked discussion about the “whitening of American Asians,” which is basically how modern perception has grouped this ethnic group into the “white” category. I know many of you are rolling your eyes. Understand that this is social science, and there are infinite complexities to this. So when he says in the video that this debate on whiteness hasn’t begun in Germany, maybe you should try to understand American social tensions. You may discover some applicable phenomena.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9g23vb/lets_talk_about_integration_in_germany/e619azd/,sloanj1400,1537038223

* Rule of law: The EU is based on the rule of law. Everything the EU does is founded on treaties, voluntarily and democratically agreed by its EU countries. Law and justice are upheld by an independent judiciary. The EU countries gave final jurisdiction to the European Court of Justice which judgements have to be respected by all.
* Human rights: Human rights are protected by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. These cover the right to be free from discrimination on the basis of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, the right to the protection of your personal data, and or the right to get access to justice.

&gt;STRASBOURG (Reuters) - European Union lawmakers voted on Wednesday to force Google, Facebook &lt;FB.O &gt; and other technology firms to share more revenues with European media, publishers and other content creators in a shake-up of copyright rules.

&gt;“We have seen so far that many large tech companies have been exploiting works of artists and creators without properly paying them. Therefore we need to establish a fair balance between European right-holders and the online platforms,” he said.

&gt;“It is beyond comprehension that time and again EU policy makers refuse to bring copyright law into the 21st century. Consumers nowadays express themselves by sampling, creating and mixing music, videos and pictures, then sharing their creations online,” 

isn't this problem solved already? if you make a new work combining other works, it could be seen as a completely new work

Generating them is already automated. One of the defences to them is to automatically generate adversarial examples and to include them in your training set for your model. Even with this they still produce much higher error rates than normal, especially when you re-run the adversarial example generator against the new model.

It's not the case that a model-designer can look at how you're generating adversarial inputs and change their model to stop performing badly on them, forcing you to find a new method of generating them, in a sort of algorithmic arms race. The method for finding them is general across models - and adversarial examples that break one model also tend to make another perform badly.

Perceptual hashing should give you a hash were similar inputs give you similar outputs, that's useful when you want to detect similarities.

Cryptographic hashing gives you hashes give you a hash where it ought to be impossible for others to give another input that results in the same hash, or at least where that is impossible faster than just trying random inputs (given that a hash has a fixed size, but for cryptographic hashes the input isn't limited in size it is always possible to find inputs that have the same output, the question is just: how fast, and under what circumstances).

The arch has a rise of 52 metres (171 ft), and the maximum clearance above river level is 70 metres (230 ft) above the Douro.

804,"Croatia’s possible entry into the eurozone has become the subject of much talk among economic and political leaders over the past two years, as well as everyday citizens. EURACTIV Croatia reports.

Croatians are afraid that prices might rise so much that a number of tangible advantages of having the euro are being ignored in popular discussions.

But in essence, citizens of the Balkan nation, which joined the EU in 2013, have already adopted the euro ‒ they have long decided to keep most of their savings in the single currency.

The euro is also the most popular currency for purchases of large-ticket items like cars and apartments.

Most citizens still remember hyperinflation and trust the euro more than the domestic kuna currency, yet they fear a decline in living standards will be inevitable once Croatia adopts the single currency.

Which is why citizens demand answers to legitimate questions, such as: ‘are our fears justified?’, ‘What will the introduction of the euro mean for everyday life in Croatia?’ and ‘How well are we progressing in the matter of the euro introduction?’

Croatia accelerates plans for joining the eurozone

Croatia’s government began to think in earnest about joining the eurozone on Thursday (10 May) when it adopted a new strategy that targets switching to the single currency within five to seven years. But opposition forces claim that it is not in Croatia’s best interests.

Fear of rising prices

Perhaps the best example of the effect of introducing the euro is the 2007 case of neighbouring Slovenia. The average annual price increase was 3.8% ‒ not very much above the average price increase in Croatia in the same year, which was 2.9%. The following year, prices in Croatia grew more than those in Slovenia.

By category of goods, a somewhat higher price rise was recorded in restaurants and pubs.

This does not necessarily have to be the case in Croatia, where the booming tourism industry in coastal towns and major cities has already pushed prices largely to eurozone levels.

According to a European Commission assessment, the total effect of Slovenia’s eurozone entry was less than 0.5%. At the same time, salary levels grew by 7% on average in 2007-08.

Monetary sovereignty

Numerous opponents of the euro like to use the argument of monetary sovereignty, i.e. the possibility of manipulating the kuna exchange rate in times of recession.

Realistically, however, the option of weakening the kuna has been extremely limited due to the high level of indebtedness in foreign currency.

The Croatian central bank (HNB) has the option of weakening the kuna versus the euro to help domestic exporters. But this also increases the burden of foreign currency loan repayment for citizens and businesses, which could further complicate the servicing of loans during weaker economic cycles, when unemployment rises and salaries decrease.

The total cost of introducing the euro also includes one-off costs incurred immediately before and in the short period afterwards, relating to the obtaining and making of banknotes, their distribution and withdrawal of kuna banknotes and coins.

However, it is estimated that the sum of such costs does not exceed 0.5%  of the GDP.

PM says Croatia wants to adopt euro within 7-8 years

The European Union’s latest member Croatia aims to adopt the euro within the next seven to eight years, Prime Minister Andrej Plenković said on Monday (30 October).

Benefits of introducing the euro

At the same time, there are a number of benefits behind the introduction of the euro that will be felt for a longer period of time.

The elimination of the foreign exchange risk associated with the kuna against the euro is certainly the main benefit of joining the eurozone.

This measure will present a particularly big problem for all those whose liabilities are denominated in foreign currency and grow as a result of the depreciation of the euro, while there is significant volatility at the seasonal level.

This measure could also be the reason why foreign investors refrain from investing in certain domestic assets, given that there is fear of losing part of the value on the basis of exchange rate differences.

In this context, the introduction of the euro, with its reduction of foreign exchange uncertainty and other informal barriers to investment, could help attract foreign investment.

The common currency will also have a beneficial effect on the risk assessment of the country, which will lower the cost of financing.

Furthermore, with the introduction of the euro, Croatian interest rates will approach the levels of those in the eurozone, which will mean lower loan interest rates for citizens and the business community.

The costs of the currency exchange transactions between the kuna and the euro, currently estimated at around 0.3% of GDP, will also disappear. This will mean lost revenue for banks and exchange offices, of course.

In its report released in May, the Commission concluded that Croatia has fulfilled almost all the criteria for entering the eurozone.

The only challenge yet to be met is spending two years in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II) without significant exchange rate oscillations, i.e. deviations from the agreed-upon exchange rate.

Although the date of Croatia’s entry into the eurozone has not been determined yet, it is realistic to expect it within four years,  because the exchange rate movement is already in line with the usual ERM II limits.

But the accession date depends on a number of factors including Zagreb actually submitting a membership application to ERM II, as well as the time Croatia will spend under the mechanism.

Additionally, the political will and the support of other member states for the expansion of the euro area are also important factors that will largely depend on the economic and political developments in the eurozone at the given moment.

872,"So in those countries judicary is a seperate caste ?

lets look how indepedant are judges in some other countries:

Germany

The five most important judicial institutions in Germany are the Federal Court of Justice, the Federal Labour Court, the Federal Social Court, the Federal Fiscal Court, and the Federal Administrative Court. They are roughly equivalent to Poland’s Supreme Court and Supreme Administrative Court. Under the German constitution, candidates for judges on these courts are named by the federal minister of justice (equivalent to Poland’s Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro) and by a 32-member recruitment commission (of which 16 members are selected by the parliament and the other 16 by the justice ministers of the country’s individual states).

The same commission selects judges for the five courts. The appointments are subject to approval by the German federal government. Once such approval is granted, the country’s president formally appoints a judge.

All this goes to show that judges in Germany are selected by politicians.

What’s the situation like at the other end of Europe?

Spain

In Spain, judges are selected by the General Council of the Judiciary, roughly the counterpart of Poland’s KRS. The council is headed by the president of the country’s Supreme Court, and its remaining 20 members are selected by the parliament by a three-fifths majority from among candidates recommended by the Electoral Commission operating out of the Supreme Court.

The Spanish system is close to the model urged by Poland’s ruling conservatives.

France

What about France, a country whose presidents, both the current one and his predecessor, have been known to rebuke Polish politicians over rule-of-law issues? It turns out that in that country too, politicians have a significant influence on the selection of judges.

Judicial appointments in France are determined by the country’s High Council of the Judiciary. This is composed of 12 members, but given the specific features of the French system of government, the nation’s president has the majority of votes in the council. How so?

The president of France is himself part of the High Council of the Judiciary, and he also appoints three of its members. The other members are: the heads of the National Assembly and the Senate (both usually come from political parties allied with the head of state); the justice minister (usually politically close to the president); a prosecutor; a representative of the country’s constitutional court; and five judges. This inevitably means that the president -- a politician -- has the majority of votes in the High Council of the Judiciary.

Netherlands

The European Commission’s Timmermans, a Dutchman, has often hit out at Poland, suggesting it disrespected European standards. He has also lambasted the government in Warsaw over judicial reforms.

In Timmermans’ native Netherlands, judges are appointed by royal decree. This takes place at the request of the justice minister. Candidates are named by the country’s Council for the Judiciary, which is half composed of judges selected by members of the judicial community. If there are two candidates for one spot, the justice minister makes the final choice.

This brief overview shows the extent to which democratically elected politicians have a say in the process of selecting judges. Their influence varies from one EU member state to another.",,/r/europe/comments/9fzwkl/the_eureport_on_hungary_reads_like_an_ideological/e60nlsz/,Culaio,1537016079
873,"It's not like they have years of experimental evidence with Youtube for example...

Provisions like Article 11 have [failed in the past](https://www.politico.eu/article/plan-to-make-google-pay-for-news-hits-rocks-copyright-reform-european-commission/) and are a goldmine for [copyright trolls.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_troll)

Filters like these have been in use by Youtube for years and they are far from perfect given that false positives abound (fair use being a prominent example) and, of course, bad actors are constantly trying new tactics to bypass the filtering algorithms altogether. Even if the Youtube system worked perfectly, it would still be bad in principle as it works on the presupposition of guilt: you are found guilty until proven innocent. If a user gets unjustly hit by the filters, it's up to them to prove their innocence against giant corporations and automated Youtube responses, the proverbial fight against windmills. Since there is no punishment for bad actors, this system has been used for petty reasons [such as censoring negative reviews](http://theweek.com/articles/608700/copyright-laws-are-breaking-youtube-heres-how-fix-problem) and eventually escalated into the so-called ""ad-pocalypse"" that [disproportionately affected new media,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRyuI6yYGcE) which just happens to have strong opinions against the establishment.

Another problematic aspect of Article 11 is that [publishers cannot waive the link tax even if they want to,](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/04/european-copyright-law-isnt-great-it-could-soon-get-lot-worse)  which would basically invalidate licences such as Creative Commons, [used by Wikipedia for example.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2018/05/08/eu-moves-closer-to-introducing-link-tax-no-exceptions-allowed/#2f8a3c3513c9) Furthermore, [the cost of Wikipedia implementing a filtering system should not be ignored, the new Directive could render Wikipedia's citations as infringements and the potential for copyright trolls abusing the free encyclopedia's content is huge](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/06/eus-copyright-proposal-extremely-bad-news-everyone-even-especially-wikipedia).

In science, there's a handful of big publishers that hold the keys to serious peer-reviewed publications. In recent times, many European institutions decided enough was enough given that access to published papers [was becoming too expensive](https://blogs.plos.org/absolutely-maybe/2018/07/30/europe-expanded-the-no-elsevier-deal-zone-this-could-change-everything/). Furthermore, a more global push for open access science has also been gaining traction (because why should publicly-funded science end up behind paywalls?), which of course prompted [these big publishers](https://www.enago.com/academy/move-boycott-elsevier-journals-deal-near-dead/) [to take action](https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2018/jun/29/elsevier-are-corrupting-open-science-in-europe). Instead of helping, the new copyright laws could [add even more paywalls and more expenses to science repositories and institutions](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03837-7).

The United Nations has also criticised the Directive from a human rights standpoint. David Kaye, United Nations special rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression, [published a letter](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Opinion/Legislation/OL-OTH-41-2018.pdf) stating that the vague letter of the new legislation violates the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, among other issues.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/9fzsrf/how_the_eu_thinks_upload_filters_will_work_vs/e60nlxy/,Tychoxii,1537016085

I doubt they will force every social network to implement them, because there are plenty, pheraps they'll force Facebook, Twitter, maybe Reddit, but considering also that these are present in not-EU countries I don't think this will be a solution.

Same thing for browsers. There are plenty of browsers and if I'm not wrong, if you have an old version of a browser (which could be the actual version of Chrome/Firefox/Opera/etc... you are using now, since in the future this version will be considered old) they can't actually apply the filters.

I think the best they can do is to force search engines like Google, Yahoo and others to remove from their results these links.

Install the filters on the PC? Mh, it sounds very distopic to have an EU system on every PC that checks what you do.

Also, I can't imagine how much the work will be difficult to develop.

Checking all the information, images, media in general uploaded and checking if they violate copyright laws.

Do you know how many movies, music, etc... have been produced?

I think Youtube had been able to do a similar thing with music because music is uploaded in databases since years, for example you just have to ask to Apple, Spotify or Google itself to send you their music database and you'll find probably tons of music people actually listen to, so they had been able to do it.

But saving all the movies produced since now in a database? Considering also that a movie is way more heavy than a music file.

They should start an article 7 procedure against us as well, we're in violation of too many core principles. 

Our judiciary is not independent, judges are picked by the head of state, the head state while being the head of government, is also the chairman of the supreme court. Judges are fired on their first day of retirment.

There's ample cases of corruption and conflicts of interests, see the gas vs collapsing houses as a recent example, or D66 party leader recieving an apartment as a gift while not declaring it, or Rutte's agreement with Unilever to cancel dividend taxes in exchange for their HQ, of course being generally one of the biggest tax evasion loophole on the planet should count too. The christian democrats also got a gift from a financial advisory company, contrary to law they didn't declare it either, like D66. 

There's no privacy or data protection, dragnet surveillance is everywhere, authorities have the right to hack your home network, your information is shared with countries around the world, even whitewashed by having others acquire your data in cases the state itself is not allowed to

There's no academic freedom, only accredited courses recieve funding, students following non accredited courses do not have access to scholarships

There's no freedom of association, motor clubs have been banned from several regions for example.

1029,"He started by owning an inn. During the Romanian Wild West (immediately after the fall of the communist regime) a lot of shady things happened and a lot of individuals became rich in a very short amount of time. That was the time where the cunning would profit and build relations with other like minded individuals. He's one of them.

Dragnea got more and more influent in his county (which is also one of the poorest in the entire country) , until he became a regional leader ( politically and unofficially as well). He latter became the leader of the Social Democratic Party after the last leader resigned after the Collective Incident ( a fire at a rock concert where a lot of people died and it was later found out that some people didn't do their job and that the institutions wheren't prepared for such an event.) A total shit show.

Slowly, he replaced every competent individual with his puppets. The reason why the other social democratic leaders with power  and influence in the party didn't get rid of him is because they need him. He's leading the vanguard against the justice system and is slowly replacing people in those institutions with his own. They want to modify the penal code so that a lot of politicians with problems (including Dragnea) will stop risking prosecution, jail and even get some of their offences washed away.

 If things go their way, they get what they want, even if that means that robbers, interlops, drug dealers, pimps, criminals and rapists get away (that's the extent of what they want to do; they just want to get away, regardless of the large scale implications). If things go south, he'll be the sacrificial lamb. 

Currently there are some internal conflicts in the party (among other problems) and now he's using this referendum to distract the attention from them. He also awaits the sentencing in a process, and if he's found guilty, he'll go to jail. The clock is ticking and he wants to pass the laws he needs to escape prison as fast as possible. He keeps trying to pass an Goverment Urgency Ordonance for about an year because, if that Ordonance is valid even for one second, he and other politicians will be free. 

He also has the help of the Constitutional Court, where the majority is made out of people with interests that Dragnea exploits. Also, the Lawyer of the People got his salary and future pension raised to a point where he mostly turns a blind eye to everything the parliament is doing. He's the only one that can block such an Ordinance

Why they got in power?
Even in current times, mayors are seen as gods by some older people because they are used to the communist ways, where the ones that knew the adequate people would be relatively ok. This cinical mentality was inherited by their children, our parents. It's a very tribalistic mentality.

The ones born after those times or to young to remember them not as much, at least compared to them. We are the ""rebels"" so to speak...at least those of us that don't fall in the nihilistic mentality trap that nothing is going to change and that is better to leave Romania for other countries. That's why we have such a huge diaspora. Because since infancy we're told to leave our country.

This mentalities are very beneficial for the current political elite because we defeat ourselves.

Also, do to this mentality, people don't go to vote because they think that nothing is going to change. Despite this, the most loyal and constant voting demographic is the one represent by elderly people who are nostalgic for the communist regime and other people that are dependent on state money, so they vote the democratic socialists (who are socialist only by name). These people are so desperate and vote for them for what are basically scraps and empty promises.  They don't have the basic education to understand some more complex things like for example inflation or what each state institution has to do. They are uneducated on this matters and that's how the political class wants them to remain. They are stuck with the mentality thay the president decides everything, just like in the time of the communist regime. They don't held the mayor accountable for what happens in their village.

Only 39% voted in the last parliamental election, mostly the social democratic loyal demographic. They currently almost make up the majority by themselves in the parliament ( note: they are the only party since 89 that held power in the parliament by themselves and they are the party that was most in power since 89, either by themselves or in coalitions).

 Add to that that the social democrats had a very efficient tactic. They promised salary and pension rises and other things that people want, but are not feasible on such a short amount of time, screwed up the economy, leaved a total mess and left about an year before the 2016 parliamentary elections, leaving a technocratic government in their place. Those guys did what they could while the social democrats, then in the opposition, screamed that those guys were undoing everything they worked to give to the people and that they were hiding money from the people.

ERE is destroyed like so many other empires, as well as Ottoman Empire itself. This is the zeitgeist, times are a changin'. Turks get into muslim world due to factor of they first met them on their migration to west and adopted them, keep aside at that timeframe being muslim was almost equivelent of being European member state regarding richness and civilization level of that time muslim world, meanwhile Europe was in dark ages. (now it is competely vica versa)

As I said, it is not a choice, it is history. Noone would know that there is another continent west of Europe, or a way to go to India by passing a newly discovered Cape. Noone would know that European nations will have access to enormous goods of new world, noone would know that one day Europeans will colonize and bring riches of India by means of maritime. 

History is good because of that. Really think about it, what if there were no Americas at the west of Europe but instead a vast, not easily passable pacific ocean at that time? What would happen if antiarctica was connected by land to africa and had no strait of Hope?

1185,"Im going to copy paste a comment from another redditor thatvis pretty indicative of the relevance of this scholar:

I think his account of his travels is pretty fascinating.

On Palermo:

It is the metropolis of these islands, combining the benefits of wealth and splendour, and having all that you could wish of beauty, real or apparent, and all the needs of subsistence, mature and fresh. It is an ancient and elegant city, magnificent and gracious, and seductive to look upon. Proudly set between its open spaces and plains filled with gardens, with broad roads and avenues, it dazzles the eyes with its perfection. It is a wonderful place, built in the Cordova style, entirely from cut stone known as kadhan [a soft limestone]. A river splits the town, and four springs gush in its suburbs... The King roams through the gardens and courts for amusement and pleasure... The Christian women of this city follow the fashion of Muslim women, are fluent of speech, wrap their cloaks about them, and are veiled.

Apparently one of his more famous quotes, this time on Muslims living under the Christian Kingdom of Jerusalem following the first crusade:

We moved from Tibnin - may God destroy it - at daybreak on Monday. Our way lay through continuous farms and ordered settlements, whose inhabitants were all Muslims, living comfortably within the Franks... They surrender half their crops to the Franks at harvest time, and pay as well a poll-tax of one dinar and five qirat for each person. Other than that they are not interfered with, save for a light tax on the fruit of their trees. The houses and all their effects are left to their full possession. All the coastal cities occupied by the Franks are managed in this fashion, their rural districts, the villages and farms, belong to the Muslims. But their hearts have been seduced, for they observe how unlike them in ease and comfort are their brethren in the Muslim regions under their (Muslim) governors. This is one of the misfortunes afflicting the Muslims. The Muslim community bewails the injustice of the landlord of its own faith, and applauds the conduct of its opponent and enemy, the Frankish landlord, and is accustomed to justice from him.

Ibn Battuta's travels are also really interesting, he travelled all across the known Islamic world and even reached as far as China.

1289,"From my favourite blog on transit, breaking down the often inaccurate perceptions of the true differences between trams and buses.

&gt; Mixed-flow vs exclusive-lane operation.  Transit speed and reliability are mostly a result of how much you stop and what can get in the way.  Rail is more often run in exclusive rights of way, but some streetcars run in mixed traffic and some buses run in exclusive lanes.

1290,"&gt; Please learn to distinguish between criticism and bias. If I criticize a movie, it doesn't mean I am biased against it. However, I do have strongly negative feelings about homophobes, xenophobes and populists.

That's fair, but I think it's unfair to associate EE with those things intrinsically. I can't speak so much for other countries, but I don't think Romanians are very xenophobic. 

Quite the contrary, foreigners are often seen as ""better"". I grew up learning that everything Romanian is shitty and good things can only come from ""outside"", as it would be called. 

Now obviously this didn't turn out to be quite as true as I thought, but it is/was a common mentality. 

Sure, if you're not white, you *may* get some strange looks, but I think as someone from a multi ethnic society it might not be easy for you to understand quite how rare other races are here. 

I live in Bucharest. As in most other places you can expect to find the most educated/open/liberal people in the capital. But Bucharest itself is 96.6% ethnic Romanian. That's huge. Never mind that out of the remaining 4.4% most of them are probably other Caucasians too. To give you an idea, Tokyo is about 98.5% Japanese. 

That means that your average person *rarely even sees someone of another race*, forget about having any to interact with. I've never spoken to one! Not because I avoid them or don't like them, but because I've just never been in a social context with them. I've seen some. *Rarely*. 

So yes, if you're Black, Asian.. you might get gawked at a bit, but that's not so different from being a big tall blonde dude in Tokyo and having people take pictures of you. I really don't think most people are outright hostile to foreigners, even those who don't look like them. 

But if you go to a Western European capital, let's say Paris cos I've been there, it's completely different. You have so many people of different races living together, everyone's just used to each other and it's been that way for awhile so one might forget what it's like to be in a mono ethnic society. 

About the democracy deficit: Oh yes. That's true. But remember that places like the UK, France and the Netherlands have had hundreds of years to refine their democratic culture. Germany for all it's 20th century troubles has a long tradition of free thinking, Switzerland could be considered democratic to a fault, etc.  

I think most EE  countries are doing well given their circumstances. Consider simply the fact that unlike Russia, journalists and political opponents are not routinely murdered, at least some of the press is free even if it goes ignored and elections are not wholesale stolen, just the population is often manipulated or apathetic. 

And you know why EE countries were let in: They were good markets for Western countries, and it curbed Russian influence. It was a geopolitical issue and I think Bruxelles did get what it wanted even if the situation isn't perfect.

1447,"&gt; Not an argument.

No argument to be made when you stick your head in the sand and refuse to hear or accept anything because you view Turks in such negative light and as untrustworthy.

You should visit the Kurdish provinces in eastern Anatolia, and see how conservative and **Muslim** they are. Oh, but you will claim that you would never visit Turkey, and you will claim that I am lying. No argument to be made because you live in your own bubble. Kurds are only fighters against Islamist ideology according to you, while every single Turk has embraced Islamist ideology.

All Kurds are left wing Marxists who fight side by side with some female Peshmerga, are vegan feminists who radically oppose Islamism and fight against all Muslims. Biji Kurdistan.

&gt;Subtitle B gives the SEC further powers of enforcement, including a ""whistleblower bounty program""[133] which is partially based upon the successful ""qui tam"" provisions of the 1986 Amendments to the False Claims Act as well as an IRS whistleblower reward program Congress created in 2006. The SEC program rewards individuals providing information resulting in an SEC enforcement action in which more than $1 million in sanctions is ordered.[77] **Whistleblower rewards range from 10-30% of the recovery**. The law also provides job protections for SEC whistleblowers and promises confidentiality for them.[134]

I'm a professional economist myself, and I did work in development economics. Chang's main thesis is wrong. To imply the ever-present interventionist policies were responsible for certain countries' ascension is ridiculous. The only common factor in all succeeding countries is the relative lack of these.

Anyway, you need roads, and traffic lights, and other stuff, of course. You also need suppliers, a workforce, raw materials, etc. You pay for those, naturally.

\#1 - Looked Scandinavian at first glance. Eventually I found two buses at a stop by the harbor. I couldn't read the destinations but one had a '-ping' suffix so I looked along the coast in the Linkoping/Norrkoping/Nykoping area. Found a sign nearby saying 'Trosa' and spotted that city on the map. Then it was easy enough to find the bridge.

\#2 - Immediately found the street signs for Salerno and Cosenza. Crossed a bridge and found a sign for Potenza and Auletta (3 km). Searched for an Auletta between those three cities and then for a nearby bridge. Easiest one.

\#3 is what tripped me up. I went right across the pedestrian bridge and saw all sorts of signage for Nantes, Loire, St. Nazaire, Vannes...also a Jules Verne museum, but that didn't help me because I didn't know what city he was from. Thought it was Nantes based on the size of the city and it being on the Loire River, but couldn't find the 'Schoelcher pedestrian bridge' because the line size for pedestrian bridge was so small I completely missed it. I was looking through Angers when time was expiring so I zoomed out and clicked Nantes as fast as I could.

\#4 - Got lost in the dead end suburbs for a while but found my way onto the main road and toward a city. Realized the general area when I saw a 'Clermont-Ferrand' directional sign. It was next to a 'Riom' sign. Eventually found a municipal sign with 'Riom' on it and realized I was on the ring road around Riom. Retraced my steps.

\#5 - The language looked Finno-Ugric. I worked my way up to arterial streets and found downtown. There was a box truck with 'Lahti' on the side. Checked the street names, found myself in the middle of downtown Lahti and retraced my steps.",USA,/r/europe/comments/9ft8wj/reurope_geoguessr_challenge_week_4/e5zrhob/,waifive,1536965852

1595,"&gt; but yeah politicians don't care enough to destroy the relationship with the US over something that happened in Afghanistan.

If your argument is that our politicians would roll over to preserve the relationship with the US, you're severely misjudging the situation.

First. It's not really up to the politicians. Like I pointed out, the ICC is a world court. Not a Dutch court, or a European court. Our politicians can't just come in and say ""you know what, it isn't convenient for us if you guys prosecute these criminals, so we're just going to set them free"".

Secondly; at least in the case of the Netherlands; our constitution actually *mandates* that we act in the interest of international law and order. Stepping in and messing up ICC business to preserve our relationship with the US would result in a constitutional crisis. Our current government *might* try to work behind the scenes to prevent things getting to the point where this becomes an issue in the first place, but once it does and it's a matter of public record that Americans are being prosecuted by the court, I *really* can't see any Dutch government making the decision to intervene. It would be political suicide.

And then there's the fact that it is the US itself that is destroying the atlantic relationship and that as a result it's fairly self-evident that it's not in our interest to try and preserve what's left of that relationship, no matter the cost. Some things are more important than being buddies with the country that used to be cool but has long since turned into an asshole with anger management issues. Prosecuting war criminals is certainly one of those things.

And finally... I would have to flip that around...

But there was a stage in our history when the UK condescendingly used ‘Eire’, despite our insistence that the country’s name is Ireland.

While many people would like to unify with the North, we see ourselves as a full country, on equal standing with anyone else. 

Now, the British government consistently calls Ireland by its constitutional name. It only uses “Republic of Ireland” when there is a real need to differentiate between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

&gt; **RESULTS:**  
We evaluated **36 studies** (1978-2011; **13,673 women**).  
  
&gt; Of the COC users (n = 8,422), 85% reported an increase (n = 1,826) or no change (n = 5,358) in libido and 15% reported a decrease (n = 1,238).  
  
&gt; We found no significant difference in sexual desire in the case of COCs with 20-35 μg ethinylestradiol; libido decreased only with pills containing 15 μg ethinylestradiol.
&gt;  
&gt; **CONCLUSIONS:**  
The majority of COC users report no significant change in libido although in most studies a decline in plasma levels of free testosterone and an increase in those of sex hormone binding globulin were observed.

No.  It means that MNCs spin off companies for jurisdictions that have incompatible requirements.  For many services, like Google Search, this can probably be transparent to the user.

&gt;Not only that, but such rules could clearly violate the US First Amendment.

No, it won't.  Not clearly or at all.  The First Amendment applies to governments in the US.  It does not require that companies not delete content.

&gt;But, it also means that we're likely moving to a more fragmented internet -- in which the very nature of the global communications network is less and less global, because to allow that to happen means allowing the most aggressive censor and the most sensitive dictator to make the rules concerning which content is allowed.

German Investment Banks, especially Deutsche also used to be more conservative, used to be mostly about helping businesses with their finances giving them advice on investments lending them money at good rates, Deutsche used to have its hand in like every German business before they changed course for a more US style approach in the 90's. Linke argues that the current situation of Deutsche and Banking in general is due to this switch, the unregulated financial markets being too lucrative and endorsing bad behaviour, with making Banks public (like the third biggest one, which didn't do a switch like this and is still extremely stable and very intertwined with German economy) they want to force a change back to a model of Banking that is more concerned with ""real value"".

1861,"Some insight from Turkey:

+ As a regular follower of Turkish news, I have seen this first on Reddit, not in mainstream Turkish media. Don't get the idea that there is a serious heated discussion here about converting Hagia Sophia. Main topics are economic crisis and Syria.

+ There has always been demands from conservative Islamists to reconvert Hagia Sophia as a symbol of ""the victory of Islam against infidels"" but firstly, most of us are aware this demand is kind of pathetic. They can discover cold fusion or something if they really want to declare their superiority, not to live off a victory 500 years old. Secondly, museum brings more money than prayers.

+ When Erdogan was asked by his supporter few years ago, he retorted: ""you should first fill up Blue Mosque""

+ Since Erdogan was disappointed by his Islamist allies (Suudis supporting YPG, Syrian Islamists screwed up in civil war and his long-time Islamist ally Gulenist turned on against him), Erdogan follows much more nationalistic/statist policy. His party AKP and its followers are much more careful about opposing the foundations of secular republic and Ataturk. (The relation is that Ataturk was the one who made Hagia Sopia as museum to show that Turkey was now secular country. Reconverting it back to mosque would be understood as an attack of Islamists on secular foundation of the republic and wide range of political spectrum would protest the attempt. Of course it would have been better if the common sense, that we should cherish and protect cultural heritage, not the cult of Ataturk; kept the Hagia Sophia as museum but Turkey is far from that point.)

+Erdogan's regime has already been criticized much for lenience towards ISIS and Islamic fundamentalism, they cannot risk that further. Erdogan is much more pragmatic than told by Western media, especially during hard times.",,/r/europe/comments/9fr0by/turkish_court_rejects_bid_to_convert_hagia_sophia/e5z3yp1/,redditrasalghul,1536944185

The hypothethical scenario would be American soldiers (most likely former rather than active) being arrested *somewhere* in the world, then transported to prison in the Hague to await trial. 

There is little the US can do against that. It can try to coerce the Dutch government; but the Dutch government will take the position that the court is acting in accordance with International law, that the Dutch government has no jurisdiction to intervene other than to protect the court's integrity, and that even if it did the Dutch Constitution prohibits the government from acting in a manner inconsistent with International Law.

America COULD throw a hissy fit the way that Bolton threathens... but that wouldn't actually get those Americans out of prison and will only further cement America's pariah status.

America could also try to use actual military force to remove them...

No clue. If we had an able opposition party the obvious answer would be for Hungary's future to get behind them but we simply don't have them. Our opposition seems to be very comfortable with being opposition, always bitching about everything and not achieving anything while still getting insane salaries. Those politicians who were more idealist and driven didn't last long.

So in that case do you think every single war is a genocide? Like, a skirmish between Germany and France that results in 20 deaths on the French side is a French genocide? The Algerians committed a genocide when they killed French people in Algeria? Think man, or at least try to.

&gt; I did some more research about your claim stating that the Algerian government put the death toll at 1.5 million as a propaganda stunt. Now obviously you were wrong, ALGERIAN historians put the death toll at I 1.5 million, Krim Belkacem states that there were 300,000 deaths DURING the investigation of the atrocities committed by the French, and that investigation did not take into account the killings by the OAS.

2008,"&gt; This is disinformation disseminated by supporters of the directive. The ""nonprofit online encyclopedia"" is only part of the things that Wikimedia does. There are other community projects under the overall umbrella that are not exempt and that can have potentially larger impact than the encyclopedia such as Wikimedia Commons. Additionally, Wikipedia (the encyclopedia) is not exempt from the Article 11.

I'm really unfamiliar with the workings of the Wikimedia. If you would have said Wikimedia instead of Wikipedia in your previous post I wouldn't comment on it so I'll stop now.

&gt; Oh, this is a nice argument. ""If they did right thing they would not have been caught"". This is circular logic assuming that the legislation is just and right so running afoul of it is wrong. I can argue that the legislature is unjust and that opposing it is actually a civic duty. Actually I fully expect this to be the thing. Many people will embrace true piracy as justifiable thing to do in such an environment. 

My reasoning isn't circular, if you think it is please show where and how so that I can show you that it isn't. I certainly don't see how could you possibly summarize what I wrote as ""If they did right thing they would not have been caught"".

&gt; Oh, I will gladly oblige. Transformative work ranges from somebody doing movie rewies, parody or even a reaction video/article citing the original piece for critique. This is even now regularly caught in content filters and causes a lot of problems. 

And yet there is no free speech campaigns against the companies that use those technologies, maybe because that is not a huge problem? In fact this directive improves on this situation by requiring those companies to have a sensible complaint and redress mechanism. Besides there is nothing in the directive about upload filters or any other technologies to be used to accomplish the goals of the directive so I have no idea how you could blame something that is already happening on this directive.

&gt; What if you take a picture and there in the picture is a billboard with picture from the movie? What if you make a cooking video and neighbour plays some music on his radio that causes your video to be infringing on the copyright?

Well, if it infringes on somebodies copyrights it should be removed. If it doesn't it shouldn't be removed. This directive doesn't change the copyright laws.

&gt; For content filters there is no difference between this type of content and outright piracy - especially if potential legal costs are going up.

There is nothing about content filters in the directive.

&gt; It is not about somebody else stepping in. It is about arranging incentive so that community content production is harder. Being unable to identify that the copyright issue is not black and white but that it has various shades of grey is what is misunderstood here. For instance speeding is bad thing. But not many people would want to have an automatic ""speeding system"" in place that blows up every car that is speeding because car producers are liable for every speeding ticket. Possibly arguing that ""ambulances are exempt"" so everything is rosy. 

I'm guessing that this is still related to content filters. There is no word of contents filters in the directive nor anything about how the goals of the directive should be achieved. That is up to the stakeholders to decide. If stakeholders choose content filters how is it the directives fault, especially as they are already being used?

&gt; The main argument is that this legislature shifts the power towards large copyright holders.

How, what new powers are these large copyright holders granted by this directive?

&gt; And it is not that they are out there to get some average joe making spider-man fan movie. It is that they are willing to throw all those people under the bus just so that they can get a few more dollars of profit. The cost of Walt Disney being able to block one pirate is worth if hundred fan made movies never get published because they are blocked. This is the true cost of the legislature.

This directive has nothing to do with that. This directive is created to ensure that the work of some isn't used by others for profit. Do you think that is wrong, why? Do you think that that is not the goal of the directive? Then pleas explain what the goal of the directive is and how it achieves it.",,/r/europe/comments/9fpt0r/how_i_feel_after_article_13_was_approved_by_the_ep/e5ynk19/,Bek,1536929314

I've read Moscovici's statements, and apparently he didn't address Italy directly, instead he was talking on a general basis about how things in Europe are getting dark. The best quote I've found is:

And now I'm supposed to buy the Russia-Russia-Russia story for 3 years , when Robert Muller can't provide direct evidence of actual collusion for almost 2 years .




You don't understand ""Trumpism"" because you have not been betrayed by the people who have the lisence to tell the truth -- the actual truth , not the ""Trump is guilty until proven innocent"" kind of truth .




McCain's death was a good reminder .  See, the same media that you trust told us that he was basically Hitler when he ran against Obama for President .  But now, now he's a hero . A mavrick . According to the same media .




So yeah , CNN , NYT , RT , Fox News  ?  The exact same garbage .  And more than a few of us are done being manipulated .  And Trump's results are louder than his silly words .

&gt;Unchained At Last, a nonprofit I founded to help women resist or escape forced marriage in the United States, spent the past year collecting marriage license data from 2000 to 2010, the most recent year for which most states were able to provide information. We learned that in 38 states, more than 167,000 children — almost all of them girls, some as young 12 — were married during that period, mostly to men 18 or older. Twelve states and the District of Columbia were unable to provide information on how many children had married there in that decade. Based on the correlation we identified between state population and child marriage, we estimated that the total number of children wed in America between 2000 and 2010 was nearly 248,000.

The minority is large enough to noticeably change entire countries' crime statistics, to noticeably make it more dangerous to be out alone at night etc. and at the same time it's not like the non-criminal majority are doing well either. The only positive is that they don't beat up people, rape people etc. Plenty of those people don't work either, don't integrate either, don't take part in the culture or society etc. so it's not like they aren't a problem as well, they're just not criminals.

Dis gon be good.

White is  a race, black is a race. Black Americans, like white Americans come from several countries. Most come from western Africa. You seem to consider English marrying German as intermarrying. By that definition, black people are the most intermarried, as you can't even pinpoint anyone to a single country anymore due to indiscriminate intermarrying. I am at a loss at how someone could be so off on something like this.  As for race, black Americans marry outside of their race more than white people.

Which brings me to what does this have to do with assimilation? Let's not even bring up the point that white people actually and actively stopped black people form integrating with them through segregation, anti interracial marriage laws, etc.

Likewise a normal person can propose a law with enough support. The government can then vote on it and accept it. Or it also goes to public vote.

For example, silicon tetrachloride is treated with water giving harmless silica and hydrochloric acid (after dilution, and if concentrated or gaseous is a commodity chemical)

Attempts at recycling nuclear waste are environmental abortions, for example Mayak, Russia reprocesses spent fuel into new fuel and is the most environmetally contaminated place on the planet.

The South African government, with full support from the western media. Where the hell have you been?

&gt;You didnt answer either about what status youd give 2nd, 3rd generation immigrants.

Actually I did, quite clearly. To repeat: 

*""You talked about ""Congolese, Morrocans, etc"" who are second or third generation. So what? Let me ask you something: How many generations would I, as a white person, have to live in America before I'm considered Native American?""*

If you can't suss out the answer from that, this conversation is obviously over your head. The status of non-Europeans who have been living in Europe for more than one generation? The same as the status of non-Europeans who have been living there for less than 1 generation. NON-EUROPEAN. What do you think, that after some arbitrary amount of time the soil will magically turn them into Europeans? Good lord. 

&gt;Also 1/2%? Nice way of making up stats

It's called a hypothetical. You're really reaching. 

&gt;Now tell me about Turks? Tell me about Gypsies? Tell me about jews? Ashkenazim¿ What about Sefardi?

They're not European. Which part of this is confusing to you? It's like if we were discussing Japan and you were sitting there saying: ""Now tell me about Irish? Tell me about Indians? Tell me about Jews?"" Here's what I'd tell you: they're not Japanese... as though that wasn't obvious given how you refer to them.

&gt;If you make ARBITRARY decisions as to what a colour is and isnt, its ok, no suffering will result out of that.

There is nothing arbitrary about it. Arbitrary means at random and without reasoning. I explained the reasoning quite clearly, and it is the same reasoning which applies everywhere on earth outside the Marxist madhouse of the modern west: if you are not of the native stock of Europe, you cannot be European. Ask the Jews about ""the right of return."" A people is a shared ancestry, as much as a shared geography. 

&gt;Now, the kind of separations you guys seem to propose can and will have a very serious impact on the lifes of millions of people, what do you make out of that?

I think it's tragic. But life generally is. You don't get to avoid suffering. You must merely choose to reduce it where possible. And the only thing worse than impacting the lives of millions of non-European people living in Europe, is to do nothing, let the division and conflict increase, and create far, far more suffering in the future. Ultimately, Europe belongs to the Europeans. Which means they must come first. While it is sad to tell me that if I feed my children someone else's will starve, the only thing worse would be for me to feed someone else's children and let my own starve.

Regarding equal treatment of women: the report cited a report by a UN Working Group, observations by the UN Human Rights Committee and a statement from the European Commission. Their primary concern was that Hungarian law does not adequately protect women against discrimination.

This is a very big if. Even in France you see the banlieues mostly populated by ethnic minorities while the city centers are mostly white. One of the biggest contentions people have with immigration policies is that migrants, refugees, and immigrants are forming separate communities and aren't integrating well all across Europe. Geographical segregation leads to divergent culture as children are raised in different environments. No European nation has a post racial society.

I'm black. Most black people in the US grow up in mostly black areas. Most white people in the US grow up in mostly white areas. There is no such thing as a common American culture. Many of my current classmates still come from the same areas with the same demographics and the same cultures in which antagonism of my own background is common and therefore makes it hard for me to relate or befriend people. Oftentimes I feel ostracized because i've never golfed, I don't live in a gated community, I can't trace my heritage, I don't speak ""proper"", I don't know much about Pink Floyd or the Beatles, and I can't relate with a toooonnnnn of things that my white peers have. 

It's like being an immigrant in a completely foreign land. There's going to be very few people I could be able to turn to and almost immediately know what i'm going through and being able to understand culturally motivated/influenced goals, desires, and aspirations. There's not going to be very many people who I can relate to.

2706,"&gt; This is less about the internet, and more about Tech monopolies and their failure to stop profiting off of the works of artists they don't even compensate properly.

No. It is *purported* to be about fair remuneration of publishers and artists. And that is a very valid goal to have. That's just not what made it into the text. The text assigns *new rights* to publishers, licensing for publishers and removes the safe harbor provisions we had previously, making everyone (who isn't an individual) with a comment section or anything user generated liable for what the users share. Not Google, FB or anyone specific - everyone. Google doesn't care, they have the de facto state of the art tech to deal with it (which doesn't really work, but EP didn't care about that).

&gt; Do you disagree that artists should have final word or be able to negotiate a contract with Google, FB, etc.?

Yes. I absolutely do. What exactly do you think artist means? When people in this debate mention artists negotiation for their own remuneration, I get the distinct feeling that they have this vision of Metallica or Madonna striding into Google HQ and sitting down at a table. What about the millions of **other** people producing stuff, are they going to line up behind them? The only way that vision is going to work is with automated filters, registration processes and claims-counter-claims. We already know how that works, and the ""struggling"" artists aren't the ones coming out on top there. And that's not to mention the thousands of other platforms that do not have the resources or expertise to handle this.

Record and movie industries post record earnings year after year, and I have a hard time seeing why there would be starving artists anywhere, if they were actually paid their fair share. Publishers don't give a shit about artists, we have 100s of years worth of data to back that statement up.

Fair remuneration isn't going to come from Google or FB or whatever, it's going to come from artists actually waking the fuck up.

&gt; It irks the hell out of me that all this ""death of the internet"" spam is being created by a few American tech oligarchs that monopolise the entire web, and use their lobbying power to interfere in the political process of a foreign government for their own financial gain under the guise of a political cause that ignorant people gobble up

I can agree with you on that. Hyperbole never did anyone any favors. Lobbying hurts everyone except the few people in the room at the time. This time the techbros out of Silicon Valley actually failed in their attempt. I would much rather have a process where lobbying wasn't allowed at all, and members of the EP were required to show at least a passing knowledge of the subjects they vote on. This decision was backed by the big publishers and voted through by ignorant or lazy MEPs.

&gt; Tech oligarchs failed (or more likely, deliberately intended not to) to keep up with copyright laws, and now it's those who want creative control over their works' fault? Your desire for free content doesn't overshadow the rights of those who created the content

Where do you think this ""fair remuneration"" and ""license"" agreement funds are going to come from? There aren't anyone around to pay for all this beside you and me. Google doesn't have a money press. They take their funds from their advertisers, who in turn take it from their clients, who get it all from you and me. That's not going to change. All this decision does is funnel some of that money to legacy media, because they failed to keep up with the times and got overtaken by products that people actually want more.

So no, they didn't break the Internet, that has always been a stupid sentiment. They just made it a lot harder to be a small to medium sized provider of anything, and they are probably also going to make the experience in general worse for the consumers.

2725,"[imcream](https://www.reddit.com/user/imcream) ;  [wildeastmofo](https://www.reddit.com/user/wildeastmofo)  : Ok , where should i start because both of you are spreading some opinions based on misconceptions and ignorance.

'' how dominant the russian macho culture still is in the east. ''

Maybe in some eastern countries true, but in the country at hand Russian culture barely had any influence. Forty years in communism did influence some parts of the current generation but the ''russification'' process failed pretty badly in Romania

'' culturally they're lagging behind''

For someone as open minded as you two seem to be (or at least claim) this statement in discriminatory if not racist. Culturally speaking Romania and the other eastern countries advanced at the same pace as the rest of Europe. We also have values and traditions that we cherish, rotted in long histories as every other country on this continent or on Earth. Maybe you judge us as old-fashioned or obsolete but i should remind you that in the ''modern'' cultures of the western world you have : school shootings, terrorist attacks,  mass surveillance. etc. Things that are unheard of here. Or should i start mentioning how recent segregation was a thing in the ''greatest country in the world''  ? I'm not saying we are perfect, but neither is the western world, so you might wanna tone down that superiority complex.

The word you are looking for is ''SOCIETY'' not culture. Yes the society might be a little old-fashioned, but thats what 40 of communism do to you. Things get better and better as generations change. It's a gradual process.

Now, to explain what is going on in Romania on this subject. The best and most simple way I can put it is in these two words . Nobody cares. This is just a charade to divert people's attention from other problems, and nobody is buying it. The referendum needs 30% of voters to show up. Considering that  at the important elections barely 39% showed up .......yeah , gay people can relax, nothing is going to happen. The vast majority of the society here doesn't care about what you do in your bedroom. Sure, some may not like it, but they won't do anything against you. THIS HAPPENS ALL OVER THE WORLD. The people who ''care'' about this referendum some politicians and some over religious followers of the orthodox church of Romania who still has a important role in the society of the rural parts. But no, the villagers won't go in the streets with pitch forks to protest against same sex marriage. Nobody cares.

'' these corrupt bigots need to get on with the times ''

Yes, they need to go, but they are ''with the times''. They are smarter than they look and underestimating them is what keeps them getting away with sh\*t like this.

'' I gotta tell them that it's all true - the bigotry, the rampant racism, the divisiveness, the general air of hostility ''

Well you are either living in a very bad neighbourhood or are lying to those who are asking. Bigotry is present all over the world, rampant racism is not a huge thing here like in the west as i mentioned before. Divisiveness is again, present all over the world, that doesn't mean i can't sit at the same table with someone and have a good time with them just because they voted differently. The general air of hostility .....''sweety'' just because people don't say hello and smile on every corner doesn't mean that they are hostile. I hear this ''argument'' in general from teens who travel to other countries for the first time and i ask them ''what does this mean?'' and they can't answer. It means nothing. People are as welcoming as in every other parts of the world. I heard this thing from people traveling to Switzerland. So no ... maybe there aren't fun parties at every corner, but that doesn't mean it's a hostile country. Tourists say quite the opposite ...but i digress.

''  LOVE! We need to fight them with more love and inclusiveness. ''

No, you need to stop aggravating them and concentrate at making yourself a better person. Not everybody needs to have the same mentality as you. And as people gradually evolve into better persons, society will improve. There is no such thing as a ''mass-culture'' change. These things happen over generations, and on the homosexual subject for example  it gets better and better with each year.

'' I hope these old hateful vermin will just die already so we can finally have our era of love. ''

Awfully extremist of you...... need i say more ?

'' Oh and to all those nazis who are gonna downvote me: you don't own the definition of LOVE, sweety! ''

Great .....now opinions are illegal and you are a nazi for having one. The people might downvote you for your over  pompous attitude or the fact that you are commenting on a subject that you are unqualified for with ''arguments'' based on you own feelings and not in reality.

I'm annoyed by his corruption and erosion of democratic rights, but when these democratic rights are eroded from the left, the leftist EU establishment doesn't say a word. When people in UK get arrested and tried for breaching political correctness, the EU doesn't say a word. When surveillance state destroys privacy and people need to surrender their devices for copying at the border, the EU doesn't say a word. When a small town in Germany has to house a migrant center with population 10 times higher than the entire town and are victims of violence, EU doesn't say a word. And this reveals criticism of Orban to be largely politically motivated rather than a genuine frustration with erosion of human rights in EU.

2784,"Could you please reference an official definition? Nobody has classified the casualties of the Greek War of Independence as a genocide as far as I know so you must understand why I'm being a bit sceptical about this. I'm afraid your word is not enough. The high percentage of Muslims in Greece makes me think that we were not that good at ""systematically cleansing and massacring Ottoman Muslims"".

People get killed during wars unfortunately. The Greek revolutionaries were mostly focused on the Ottoman army since their main objective was to overthrow the Ottoman rule, but unfortunately thousands of civilians were also killed, like in the case of Tripolitsa (the Greek population of the city was massacred a few months before the siege according to Wikipedia. That I didn't know.).

However, as you can see [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacres_during_the_Greek_War_of_Independence) massacres were committed by both sides and not just Greeks. The Ottomans massacred the Greek populations of [Constantinople]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople_massacre_of_1821), [Chios](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chios_massacre),[Psara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_Psara),[Missolonghi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Siege_of_Missolonghi) and Wikipedia mentions that massacres also occured in Crete, Cyprus, Ionia, Peloponnese and Macedonia. When it comes to massacres done by Greeks, Wikipedia mentions only [Tripolitsa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tripolitsa),[Navarino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navarino_massacre) and some massacres in Peloponnese, Central Greece and the Aegean Islands.

After reading these articles, I think it's safe to say there were way more Greek casualties. Makes sense since the revolution only succeeded in a small area while the Ottomans naturally had the upper hand in most cases (it was their vast empire after all). That being said, I wouldn't be surprised if massacres of Muslims were less likely to be reported by European philhellenes. But let's just say that the massacres were about the same for both sides. By your definition of genocide, does that mean that there was another Greek genocide before the one in the 20th century? And if so why did you fail to mention that before? You made it seem like the Greeks were the only ones that massacred, but that's not what happened. Ottomans systematically cleansed and massacred too.

My opinion on the matter is that since the atrocities committed by both sides haven't been classified as ""genocide"", it's not genocide. They were horrible massacres (but again that's how war is unfortunately), but it wasn't genocide on either side. However, if it has been classified as such by a reputable neutral party, I'll gladly admit I am wrong.",,/r/europe/comments/9e7bxy/yörük_from_greece_with_his_firstborn_19th_century/e5xn8tr/,spiros_epta,1536879908

Or the fact that Polish soldiers were allowed to cross to Romania (and eventually UK) via Hungary? Both of those would be totally idiotic and pointless moves if Horthy did not care about Hungarian relations with the Poles.

And talking about hindsight, how would have Horthy been able to know in advance in September of 1939 that Hitler wouldn't only take the Danzig corridor and some border territories, while making Poland a puppet (rump) state or protectorate, much like they did with Slovakia after invading Czechoslovakia?

It's only with hindsight that we know that Hitler was actually planning to kill or remove all the Poles to Siberia. What's more, when the German-Polish war started and ended, it was still not even clear to Hitler himself that a world war had actually started and that there would be no peace with the Allies. Nor was it clear that Germany would (temporarily) win that war in continental Western Europe by successfully conquering France (considered the strongest military in the world at the time) in weeks.

The problem European copyright is having is that it is so much heritage law that we are somehow trying to implement in the world of 21st century and in order to do that we are imposing surveillance and censorship on a scale we have never seen before. That's the problem. The internet has changed the world and Copyright needs to adapt to that change. Not the other way around. The current copyright system doesn't offer flexibility compared to the tech we have, hence this discussion. 

The EU can go too far. I am a staunch believer in the EU but following this process has made me more cynical. I try to tell myself that it is a matter of generations, pee and post internet. But it is also matter of understanding and perception.

2959,"&gt;There were still thousands of Jews in Germany after the Holocaust.

Well that can be a bit misleading. Even if there were two thousands Jews left, it would still make your statement correct but without giving the whole picture. What are your sources? According to this [Wikipedia article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Jewish_population_comparisons) in 1900 there were 586,948 Jews in Germany while in 1970 there were only 30.000 Jews, which makes me think that the numbers were even lower after the Holocaust.

Greece of course has a much smaller population than Germany. In 1920 Greece had about five million people, half a million of which were Muslims. That's a pretty big percentage which is why I'm saying that there was no genocide during the Greek revolution. 

If we had killed thousands upon thousands of Muslims and there was indeed a genocide, there wouldn't be so many during the time of the population exchange. If a genocide had happened, it would probably look more like the population of the Jews after the Holocaust in Germany. And by the way if you ask me, a drop of about 550.000 thousand people is pretty close to extinction.

But let's just say I'm completely wrong. What is the definition of genocide according to you? Did the Greeks commit genocide?

According to the U.N. genocide is:
&gt;""acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group"".

Which doesn't seem to be the case because as I think I've mentioned there were half a million of Muslims in Greece.",,/r/europe/comments/9e7bxy/yörük_from_greece_with_his_firstborn_19th_century/e5x60ln/,spiros_epta,1536864811

In fact, judging from footage you get from the media, you would swear that Juncker is especially fond of the more taunchly eurosceptic leaders than anyone else. Orban in particular seems to be his favourite

This is no coincidence. Juncker knows that an PM like Orban has a lot of big talk he needs to deliver on. Stand up to Brussels and all that. At the same time, in order to do so he has to stay on good terms with his negotiating partners, lest he antagonizes them. So any politician worth their salt goes in there with a well thought out strategy on how to navigate between them. Firm yet friendly, staunch yet open. All Juncker has to do is upset that strategy. Orban loses either way.

You can say that it creates an obligation for redress mechanisms but it is waaaaayyy too shy about this point, I'm a european, I want this proposal (which is going to be implemented by each member state like mine differently) to be extremely precise and guarantee that my country's implementation of this proposal is going to give me powerful tools to fight against unlawful convictions (like it seems to be very precise about how to convict for some reasons...).

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want rightholders to be involved in the setup of such redress mechanism, while the takedown is an agreement between them and the plateform, redress mechanism are between me and the platform. Why is paragraph 3 including them and not including consumer association/citizen representation?

&amp;#x200B;

If the law was salvageable and could have been made good with some amendments, it's nowhere near that in this form. So I say no.

At best that's a temporary measure. Like the\_gnarts said, pensions transfer wealth from a younger generation to an older one. Even if you try to make someone's productive years longer, demographics will work against you if at some point there are too many pension dependent people and not enough workers to provide for them. Pensions will be abolished and I doubt most of us will live to see our pensions (unless we've taken arrangements to build up a suitable private pension). Doubly so if we're dealing with a real free market where the government can't force anyone to hire older, less productive workers.

That is why every other culture but your own looks barbaric in comparison because all of them are and the criticisms cultures have on each other are usually valid; people just accept if of their own because ""tradition"".

The critical man does not have a ""culture""; it exists only because people don't allow themselves to be critical of the things they were raised with. There is so much shit that goes on in Europe that is downright barbaric or creepy when you think of it that would have never been accepted if it was started today but gets a pass because it's ancient like: infant foreskin amputation, alcohol and tobacco being the only legal hard drugs, parents being allowed to force their children to kiss strangers, hereditary positions in the government, high heels, mandatory gender registration, being allowed to smoke in in front of your children, adults being made responsible for each other's debts before they can visit each other in hospitals when they're sick, being required to provide the identity of your entire paternal familial line to your employer before you can apply for a job, being required to expose yourself to the most common form of catching germs to start a business meeting.

All these things if they didn't exist today and someone tried to say ""let's change the situation to these things"" everyone would be like ""no that's fucking dumb, creepy, and/or barbaric are you kidding me?"" but because they're part of the ""culture"" they get a pass.

Yes, Poland GDP in 2008 was more than double what it was in 2004 when we joined, but oddly enough Ukraine more than doubled its GDP from 2004 to 2007 without the EU, almost as if countries can grow while not being in the EU as well. 

While the graph they show in the video with GDP might show an impressive growth after joining, its a bit misleading since we were in a trend of growth for years already.

3180,"We kinda focus on history lessons how our country ruled by foreigners elected as kings and gathering of nobles was ruined by this system, how it became weak and started serving the interests of our neighbours more than ours (our neighbours being then Germany, Russia and Austria) until they partitioned the whole country while nobles argued with each other instead of taking action. This experience now looms over our democracy like a spiteful shadow. Most of Poles care about their local government, about who is the city mayor etc. However they strongly believe that the higher you go in hierarchy the more useless, corrupted and false you are... and our country history, our experience with non-authoritarian rule is only confirming this.

In Poland we often assume that every law can be ignored, that everything can be done outside what politicians say. This came from times of communism - as long as government officials don't know, you can make a lot of things ""under the table"". Something that would be considered corruption in other countries is in Poland considered normal, considered ""helping each other"" and done rarely for money. Like for example if your brother's friend is a physician, he can probably arrange that his friend will check you in his free time so you don't need to wait in line. You will probably pay him a normal amount of money for his work, and you or your brother will owe him one, that will also mean that he will repair his car in free time or something like that. 

We, Poles, do a lot outside system. It's because system never worked for us, so we rarely trust it.

As for comparison with Arthurian legend - if King Arthur was figurehead without real power and his knights couldn't agree on anything, it would be the same.

Relevant part since I figure you need some help:

&gt;The EU set the objective of introducing ""appropriate measures""[5] with respect to asylum in the Amsterdam Treaty, which required the Council of the European Union to adopt measures on asylum in accordance with the Geneva Convention and the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees[6] by 2004, five years after the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force.

and

&gt;These laws are in place to prohibit European Union Member States from sending an individual back to where they are at risk of persecution, and to offer international protection to those who are granted refugee status through the course of the law. 

The Dublin Agreement was suspended, and Hungary played an instrumental part in that suspension.

There is no legal requirement that says that refugees have to apply asylum in specific countries.

Syria is not the only country where refugees come from and no specific treaties have been made at EU level to deem them as the only acceptable refugees, so I have no idea where you got that. It's a legal requirement to take refugees no matter what they come from, including Middle East and Africa.

Your comments are really counter-productive, because it assumes these poor communities could just lift themselves up to the same level as the rich ones. And if they don't, they're lazy. Or inherently unable to. As long as this believe is held up nothing will get better.

It doesn't matter geographically they're part of Europe, large part of it actually

&gt;Monocausal explanation of a country's problems is reductionist and will give you an entirely false picture of reality, like blaming everything on immigration. France has problems of social cohesion just like Germany does or many other Western European countries that went among others with a larger economic trend of following neoclassical economic models. These models led to a concentration of wealth among not many people also good paying jobs today need serious qualification unlike in the 50's, 60's or even 70's where your manual labor was quite highly valued. Just to name a few reason for the problems that a lot of countries have to deal with. It is not just France. Unemployment in France is insignificantly affected by immigration. If at all.

Considering most countries that track ethnicity and unemployment, that's hard to believe. For example in Finland majority of adult MENA immigrants are unemployed.

&gt;And let's not treat all the 7 % of the Muslim population of France as one monolithic bloc. You might be surprised how lot's of French Muslim women don't wear the veil and are dressing just like their non-Muslim peers. Also if you ever happened to take the metro in Paris or Lyon at 5 am in the morning. You will see a lot of black and maghrebinian people go to work to do the shitty jobs a lot of white French don't want to do anymore. But hey 10.000 to 20.000 or even 50.000 rioting idiots act as representatives for more than 7 million immigrants. You know what let's make that a 100.000, which is way over the top and let's look at the ratio again and say ""the immigrants are causing this and that"".

That's fair point, the Muslim population in France isn't homogeneous.

Regarding employment, unless you can give me hard data then you're not saying much, well if anything at all besides your _*opinion*_

But yeah, there's cost to all things, and we can measure objectively the effects of immigration, or immigration from certain places. In Nordic countries, the average non-western immigrants costs about 500,000€ to have so I don't know what's the point in having them, if we're purely talking about economical perspective.

&gt;Yeah and the FN is pretty much in free fall again and are talking about changing their leader since the outlook for them is really crappy.

3287,"&gt;&gt; And proceeds to avoid the term genocide

&gt; I'm not avoiding anything mate. Let's not make up things out of the thin blue air.

Are you seriously suggesting I am making up the term Armenian Genocide out of thin air?

&gt; while talking about the deportation policies specifically

The context of the conversation is about destructions and genocide and not deportation policies, so don't try to justify avoiding the words Armenian Genocide under such pretence.

&gt; Do you want me to repeat the term genocide for 5 times just you to be content?

No, avoiding to say that people in this thread have ""no idea about the Ottoman Armenians trying to come up with ideas"" and proceed to avoid the term genocide and literally take out of the equation the very nation which was destroyed as such, the Ottoman Armenian nation, and branding it as ""Armenian armed organisations"" would go a long way to not be called out for such an intellectually dishonest comment, and that is putting it mildly.

Your comments even lack acknowledging that the Ottoman Armenian nation as such even existed at the time. Armenia was split between mainly two empires, the Russian and Ottoman one. The Ottoman Armenian nation was the most populated portion. And yet somehow this doesn't make it into your narratives. The sad part in all this is that someone which seemingly is intellectual enough judging by your comments and yet repeats like a *parrot* CUP-era narratives which justified the destruction of a nation then, and which keep on justifying it still today 103 years later. 

The objective was to avoid Armenia gaining independence or falling into Russian hands, just like it happened with some of the other Christian nations of the Ottoman Empire. Period. Armenians living in the western areas were not a problem for this for obvious reasons.

Genocide is the intentional destruction of a nation (in this context) in whole or **in part**. As long as the intention is to destroy a nation, even in part, it is genocide. The Ottoman Armenian nation as such was intentionally destroyed in large part by the CUP government. There is a term which encompasses the previous phrase: Genocide. No one is forcing you to use the term, but at least don't be condensing to the other commenters in this thread. Thanks.

3303,"I like how English has done away with so many of the grammatical bells and whistles so common to other languages. Case markers are minimal, and conjugation is almost completely gone. We only need one definite article for singular and plural nouns, and our indefinite article only changes for euphony. We don’t have grammatical gender and that’s a huge plus. I don’t have to make my adjectives agree with my nouns, either. We don’t have a trillion diacritics to deal with that make our written language look like it’s covered in dead bugs. Don’t even get me started on tonal languages - thank *GOD* I don’t have to deal with that. And “fuck” is the best swear word on the planet - fucking fight me about it. 

I don’t like how idiomatic prepositions are, although I’ve found that’s probably pretty common. Ambiguities between singular and plural “you” can get annoying at times. You can also insert some complaint about spelling variabilities, although I consider myself to be a pretty great speller. Inconsistent emphasis is annoying for learners as well I’m sure. I like how some languages have affixes that suggest a word’s part of speech, although going all-out on that front like Esperanto feels very robotic.

The image absolutely is personal data, since it can be tied to a unique individual. As long as the image and the name remain then also the visit reason, time and DoB is considered PII, since they then can be tied to a unique invidiual


So on a Data Subject Request all the data will need to be handed over to the Subject. 


Sure remove the image and name, and anything else that can be tied to a unique individual and then the rest of the data (visit reason and time of entry) would become anonymized. Being searchable or not doesn't matter. 



In fact if you keep backups on magnetic tape, and those tapes store data about an individual that you are no longer allowed to store, then you are legally required to remove that data from the tapes. 


Hanging on in the background or not doesn't matter the definition of processing is so damn wide its pretty much everything. 

Some definitions

&gt;**‘personal data’** means any information relating to an identified or *identifiable* natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;


&gt;**‘processing’** means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, **storage,** adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, **erasure** or **destruction**;

3359,"&gt; You can not say: crawl my content, but don't rip it and place extracts between your results.

Yes, but as I said before that is fair use under American copyright as well as the EU Copyright Directive not limiting such an activity. Therefore your argument should be directed at whether snipping news articles should be fair use (under the American copyright law) and limited or not under the EU Copyright Directive. There is not much chance to change the fair use under American copyright law. So ""ripping"" is done under the concept of ""fair use"". But again, the backlash isn't on providing more protection for the articles. If the legislation only dealt with that, there would be no backlash as it exists now regarding article 11. Again, this is a red herring. The issue is linking with news (titles) and not news snippets from articles.

&gt; For Facebook, users read a ton of news there, providing value for Facebook and ad income, without doing anything back for the publishers.

Is there any study showing that news sites have lost or gained revenue because of google news and Facebook? I think everybody will agree that these sites drive traffic to news sites. In the case of Spain, traffic towards news sites went down when Google news halted its service there. This is one evidence right there against the claim that these sites are detrimental to news sites.

You are also only focusing this on google and Facebook. There are many smaller companies out there. In Spain several small sites closed down because of the link tax law. This legislation has negative consequences for the smaller guys whereas it is just a dent on the big guys.

Is your argument that the world will be a better place if countries that have had the majority of their skilled labor and some large percentage of their labor in general never recover? There is an entire region that provides an example to where that path goes. Almost every problem in the Middle East has its root in the destabilization of power from foreign powers and the failure to recover after losing large portions of their middle and upper classes to migration, war, and everything that accompanies such times. 

If refugees don't return to their countries when the TIME IS RIGHT, those countries won't recover. And if Western governments can give them the proper support structures, those people will go back and make their countries prosper - improving world safety and markets. The alternatives - either from not encouraging refugees to return home OR forcing them back - will be that terrorist organizations and extremist governments can gain a foothold in those weakened countries.

3459,"**Erdogan takes control of Turkey’s sovereign wealth fund**

&amp;#x200B;

*President appoints himself as fund chairman with son-in-law as his deputy*

&amp;#x200B;

Laura Pitel in Ankara yesterday

&amp;#x200B;

Recep Tayyip Erdogan has appointed himself chairman of Turkey’s sovereign wealth fund, the latest move to consolidate his control over state institutions.

&amp;#x200B;

The president announced on Wednesday that Berat Albayrak, his son-in-law, would act as his deputy as part of an overhaul of the board of the fund, which was founded in 2016 and later took over government shares in Turkish Airlines, Turk Telekom and a string of banks.

&amp;#x200B;

The fund had been billed as a means of shoring up market sentiment and funding investment following an attempted coup that shook the economy, but it has been paralysed by disagreements about its strategy, which led to the sacking of its chief executive last year.

&amp;#x200B;

The wealth fund presides over assets worth $200bn, according to Bloomberg. Two corporate analysts, who asked not to be named, said they had not seen any evidence of political interference in companies controlled by the fund since government stakes in the companies were transferred to it in February 2017.Critics, however, accused Mr Erdogan of seeking ever greater control of Turkey’s institutions after June elections that triggered the abolition of the role of prime minister and gave the presidency sweeping new powers.

&amp;#x200B;

The latest change came ahead of a critical interest rate announcement on Thursday, a decision seen as a pivotal test of the independence of Turkey’s central bank.

&amp;#x200B;

Murat Cetinkaya, the central bank governor, has caused dismay among international investors by resisting calls to raise rates even as inflation has soared to 18 per cent. The lira, which has lost about 40 per cent of its value this year, has hit a series of record lows amid a bitter Turkey-US row and concerns about the management of the Turkish economy.

&amp;#x200B;

Long dogged by accusations of being under the sway of the president, the central bank’s credibility was further dented in the eyes of investors by a pre-election pledge from Mr Erdogan, a self-styled “enemy” of high interest rates, to take greater control of monetary policy if he won the poll.

&amp;#x200B;

Following his victory, the president gained responsibility for directly appointing hundreds of senior civil servants, including the central bank governor. He also empowered Mr Albayrak, who is married to the president’s eldest daughter, appointing him to the newly combined role of treasury and finance minister and making him a member of the supreme military council.

&amp;#x200B;

The Turkish president argues that the new presidential system will lead to more effective governance and a stronger economy. His opponents say it places unchecked power in the hands of Mr Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics since 2002.

&amp;#x200B;

Seven new board members were appointed to the wealth fund, according to an announcement published in Turkey’s official gazette on Wednesday. Zafer Sonmez, head of the Turkey regional office of Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund, was appointed general manager. It was the new roles for Mr Erdogan and Mr Albayrak, however, that drew the ire of critics.

&amp;#x200B;

Muharrem Ince, who challenged Mr Erdogan for the presidency in June, described the changes as the latest “crazy example” of the country’s poor management. “The man who has captured the state . . . has now taken public companies prisoners,” he wrote on Twitter. “This desire to control everything will in the end give way to controlling nothing. And the country pays the bill.”

&amp;#x200B;

The changes to the sovereign wealth fund sidelined one of the president’s own advisers, Yigit Bulut, who is renowned for once claiming that Mr Erdogan’s enemies were trying to kill him through telekinesis. US-Turkey crisis explained

The scale of the potential of what they can do is the important bit. We need to fight this bill right now, because if we let it get entrenched, then it will be much harder to remove it when the majority of corporations decide to escalate their actions to the top of what the law allows them to.

It's like allowing people to drive 200 km/h in a city. Sure it's impractical and will probably never happen. But what happens when they drive 100 km/h? Or someone starts making cars that can go 200 km/h easily? This is what this law does. It gives corporations a huge potential to fuck shit up and have the law to back them up while doing it. They will do shitty things and when people complain about it they will say what you are saying ""Hey, at least we aren't doing what we are fully allowed"".

&gt;Amendments adopted by the European Parliament on 12 September 2018 on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on copyright in the Digital Single Market 

Most troublesome point left (Article 13, § 3):

&gt;When defining best practices, special account shall be taken of fundamental rights, the use of exceptions and limitations as well as ensuring that the burden on SMEs remains appropriate and that **automated blocking of content is avoided**.

Automated blocking out of nowhere.

It is only hinted at if you look closely in the preceding paragraphs:

&gt;2a. Member States shall provide that where right holders do not wish to conclude licensing agreements, online content sharing service providers and right holders shall cooperate in good faith in order to ensure that unauthorised protected works or other subject matter 
are not available on their services. Cooperation between online content service providers and right holders shall not lead to preventing the availability of non-infringing works or other protected subject matter, including those covered by an exception or limitation to copyright.

&gt;2b. Members States shall ensure that **online content sharing service providers referred to in paragraph 1 put in place effective and expeditious complaints and redress mechanisms that are available to users in case the cooperation referred to in paragraph 2a leads to unjustified 
removals of their content. Any complaint filed under such mechanisms shall be processed without undue delay and be subject to human review**. Right holders shall reasonably justify their decisions to avoid arbitrary dismissal of complaints. Moreover, in accordance with Directive

Well, the same what they did for Finland, Austria or Greece - negotiate, rather than give in completely (like Americans did in Yalta). They choose to treat us like subhumans, confirming that Hitler was right.

Had the Allies supported the Warsaw Uprising... Had the Brits not blame their failures on the Poles in Market-Garden and reached Berlin first... maybe there would be a chance for Finland in Poland.

&gt;I should also note that Poland eventually became free,

It's not free, it's part of a different bloc now.

&gt;because Reagan's confrontational approach had led to US victory in the Cold War and the collapse of the USSR

Reagan had nothing to do with it, USSR fell because it was a failed state that could not function.

I'm not sure what kind of hogwash your classmates are trying to pull out of their asses. If you mean strictly geographically, well, kinda. Eurasia is the real deal as a continent and nearby islands constitute a cluster. Just like Japan is part of East Asia. But as a political, cultural and sphere of influence structure, islands close by and their people are definitely considered European. Is Siciliy not European? Many Greek islands? Malta? Balearic Islands? Iceland? Faroe Islands? 

Cyprus is geographically in Asia Minor but everything else is at least leaning heavily European. 

Azore islands are technically geographically attached to North Africa, but they are European. 

Heck, I would consider Melilla European.

3734,"[The Great Fire of Smyrna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_fire_of_Smyrna) was one of the worst episodes of the drawn out tragedy that was the [Greek Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_genocide). As Turkish forces advanced against Greek forces in 1922, they came upon the wealthy port city of Smyrna, which had been a major commercial hub, largely run by Greeks and Armenians. The Turkish forces were preceded by a massive wave of Christian refugees who retreated in panic to the city to seek shelter. Sadly they would find no safety in Smyrna. As soon as Turkish forces arrived, they set upon dousing the Greek and Armenian houses with petrol and setting them on fire. What followed was one of the most gruesome episodes in human history. As an eyewitness reported:
&gt;All morning the glow and then the flames of burning Smyrna could be seen. We arrived about an hour before dawn and the scene was indescribable. The entire city was ablaze and the harbor was light as day. Thousands of homeless refugees were surging back and forth on the blistering quay – panic stricken to the point of insanity. The heartrending shrieks of women and children were painful to hear. In a frenzy they would throw themselves into the water and some would reach the ship.

At least in the case of the Greeks many were allowed to leave in Western ships. No such mercy was shown to the Armenians. Virtually all Armenians in the city were slaughtered through sword and fire and many women and girls were raped and tortured before being killed.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use

&gt;**Fair use is a doctrine in the law of the United States** that permits limited use of copyrighted material without having to first acquire permission from the copyright holder. Fair use is one of the limitations to copyright intended to balance the interests of copyright holders with the public interest in the wider distribution and use of creative works by allowing as a defense to copyright infringement claims certain limited uses that might otherwise be considered infringement.

-

&gt;While U.S. fair use law has been influential in some countries, some countries have fair use criteria drastically different from those in the U.S., and some countries do not have a fair use framework at all. Some countries have the concept of fair dealing instead of fair use, while others use different systems of limitations and exceptions to copyright. Many countries have some reference to an exemption for educational use, though the extent of this exemption varies widely.[52]
&gt;
&gt;Sources differ on whether fair use is fully recognized by countries other than the United States. American University's infojustice.org published a compilation of portions of over 40 nations' laws that explicitly mention fair use or fair dealing, and asserts that some of the fair dealing laws, such as Canada's, have evolved (such as through judicial precedents) to be quite close to those of the United States. This compilation includes fair use provisions from Bangladesh, Israel, South Korea, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Uganda, and the United States.[53] However, Paul Geller's 1999 International Copyright Law and Practice says that while some other countries recognize similar exceptions to copyright, only the United States and Israel fully recognize the concept of fair use.[54]",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9f6pbb/the_european_parliament_has_just_passed_the_worst/e5vvkqm/,vokegaf,1536808548

3871,"When you have a confederation, you tend to run into similar problems, which can be resolved via federation.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_confederations

&gt;* **United States of America**: In its first steps, the United States were a confederation of thirteen states (Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Virginia, New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island and Providence Plantations) organized under the Articles of Confederation. 
&gt;
&gt;* **Soviet Union**: Originally it was a confederation between four soviet socialist republics (Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic and Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic). As a confederation of member states, Soviet constitutions formally defined each member republic as a sovereign state, whose membership was voluntary, and could secede at any time. Soviet constitutions of 1936-onward defined the state as a federation.
&gt;
&gt;* **Old Swiss Confederacy**
&gt;
&gt;* **German Confederation**

Those became well-known federations.  Any of these problems sound familiar?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Confederation

&gt;The Confederation was weakened by rivalry between the Kingdom of Prussia and the Austrian Empire, revolution, and the inability of the multiple members to compromise…Most historians have judged the Confederation to have been weak and ineffective, as well as an obstacle to the creation of a German nation-state.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation

&gt; Under the Articles, Congress had the authority to regulate and fund the Continental Army, but it lacked the power to compel the States to comply with requests for either troops or funding. This left the military vulnerable to inadequate funding, supplies, and even food.[16] Further, although the Articles enabled the states to present a unified front when dealing with the European powers, as a tool to build a centralized war-making government, they were largely a failure…Congress was denied any powers of taxation: it could only request money from the states.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Swiss_Confederacy

&gt;True reform, however, was impossible; the individual interests of the thirteen members were too diverse, and the absolutist cantonal governments resisted all attempts at confederation-wide administration.

They are dangerous to European democracies and we are doing a great job of making those unstable by ourselves. The big data has a vested interest to be able to influence that.

News sites are more and more commonly advert sites with news as clickbait.  If those go down. I am fine with that. If you are running an aggregator site and promote small websites with original content then how would they be in danger? Other than by bureaucratic mistake which hides somewhere in the general rules (which again I am neither for or against since I don't know them)

There are layers and layers of special interest here. I am not willing to support anything blindly. The one thing I know is that Google and Facebook and other Big Data handling information must be stopped. If something bad comes out of it we must treat it as a mistake and fix it without letting American Big Data into a position of undue influence.

3967,"Yes but well Africa is irrelevant here, were talking about Europe and specifically the EU, where democracy is firmly established and military and ethnic violence is (mostly) a thing of the past. Why should a people not have the right to govern themselves if they wish so, a smaller state can be more efficiently centralised and managed and remove the problem of outsourcing political blame to the ""greater power"" ie ruling government of the larger state. 

Similarly it benefits the people of the state when they can see directly where their tax money goes to and benefits and can swiftly address the issue of inefficient or misappropriated funds and readdress them etc. Also means that the state can properly protect its language or culture with out the more larger &amp; more dominant one overshadowing and eroding their own. 

As for weakening Europe, I thoroughly disagree, a Europe with more states of smaller and more equal in size would be very beneficial to a more integrated EU, removing the disdain for the dominate economic powers and resentment of one or two nations money funding the rest of the states.",Leinster,/r/europe/comments/9f6k2x/someone_puts_spanish_national_anthem_during_the/e5vg9fp/,tig999,1536793061

3992,"Not at all. Most AirBnb ""nests"" in Portugal are owned by portuguese people who had inherited shitty houses in shitty neighborhoods no one gave a shit about ten years ago and these mostly did one thing well which was sucking money from the poor souls who inherited these houses. Renting was a pain in the ass because the process was done in a mouth-to-mouth manner, completely unregulated resulting in burocratic clusterfucks when you wanted to actually use the property for something but you already had people living there ilegally. 

No one considers a decent investment buying already hugely inflated property, then spending three times what they spent on that propery on renovations and dealing with the absurd portuguese judicial system for *years* before you can get a change you want to make to the property approved (yes, if you want to turn an unnecessarily big room into two rooms get ready for a whole bunch of back and forth with the city hall that will last at least half a year, stalling your renovation completely). So this tourism boom and the appearance of a service that streamlines renting properties actually gave portuguese people a positive use to something that was a previously a burden.

People here adore to comment on things happening on other countries as if they're completely informed on the subject, but even basic common-sense provides the notion that buying shitholes in other countries in order to rent them and break even in 10 years is not something people do. The boom in the housing prices is very easily explained by the tax benefits the portuguese government provides to non-nationals who want to move here which is why Portugal is currently the main residence of quite a few big Hollywood big names and other high profile people. These people can buy houses for a premium and are willing to do it for those benefits which means portuguese owners of said houses inflate the prices to maximize profit. That's it.

With the quasi-facist immigrant bashing and nationalist rhetoric he maintains an extremely loyal central core of voters (especially older people) who buy into his madness. He also divided or outright bought the other parties so his opposition is really fragmented and there are a lot of people who don’t even go to vote.

Copyright laws in europe have a long way, article 11 only extends copyright laws to press publication, and the article 13 makes sharing webpages repsonsible for what they share so they don't abuse it. The ""tax link"" works exactly the same as youtube videos where copyright holders can dispute your video if you used their creations.

No, but people's right to spread them is.

That's not a goal for anyone but that's completely necessary to avoid copyright infringements. Besides, doesn't the directive state that the memes are subject to copyright laws, ie. they must be confirmed to be original or posted with the permission of the original poster?

Hungary doesn't know anything and doesn't do anything as a unitary entity. Just like ""The Jews"" don't unitedly control finance and mass media. Both are collections of individuals with a huge variety of opinions and actions. 

Previous hungarian governments have respected the requirements. Currently, a group in Hungary is taking questionable actions and changing things. As I said, these groups are usually supported by a minority of useful idiots out of the entire nation. I simply can't grasp how can you advocate in good faith for collective punishment.

4144,"&gt; It is true.

Nice propaganda article by a Reagan era official hell-bent on whitewashing Reagan's failed ""trickle-down"" economics.

Economic mainstream disagrees with his conclusions and so does the economy. Economic recovery was only possible because governments stepped in and enacted Keynesian economic policies. With his propositions, it would have taken years until the economy even would have begun to recover.

&gt; And with that they set up the next financial crisis for us.

Which is inevitable anyway, because Capitalism is inherently an unstable system that produces a never ending ""Crisis-Boom"" cycle.

Governments have to decide what is more important – keeping the systems running or letting the system fail. I doubt they would like what would happen if they let the system fail.

&gt; Poverty existed because people were poor at the time since the industrial revolution hadn't been under way for long enough.

It existed because poor people didn't have the tools yet to fight large corporations and demand that workers get their fair share. Eventually, labor laws had to be passed and unions allowed, because there would have been a revolution otherwise.

&gt; If society decides that they're not going to buy their products for whatever reason then the corporation fails.

Thats not how it works. Today companies act global. Even if by a slim chance, a whole country would suddenly decide to stop buying a product, they can just sell it elsewhere.

True but Ireland is prevented from negotiating for its self due to EU rules. If the EU just says fuck the GFA its not our problem we'll ignore what Ireland agreed with the people of NI, the repercussions of that will will be felt with by Ireland and the UK. While the EU watches from afar. 

Sure the EU can do that if it wants but don't i think anyone could seriously say its a good idea. 

The UK is taking into account the wishes of Irish nationalists that's why its trying to avoid a hard border even though its under no legal obligation to do so under the GFA and doing so has massively complicated already difficult brexit talks for the UK, the EU should be willing to do the same. 

However the EU seem to see the border simply as leverage to get the UK to stay in the single market and customs union, they don't seem to understand that the peace in northern Ireland is about finding compromise between the two groups not just forcing through the wishes of one and ignoring the other.

4185,"&gt; Economic growth in Africa is quite decent, actually. Since 2000, sub saharan Africa has tripled it's per capita GDP.

You linked GDP per capita in ""current US$"", i.e. without allowing for inflation.  You should have linked GDP per capita in ""constant 2010 US$"", i.e. in real terms.  The plot for that is [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD?locations=ZG).

In real terms, GDP per capita sub-Saharan Africa has increased by 42% since 2000.  The equivalent figure for the [entire world](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD) (projecting ahead for 2018, since figures aren't available) is 33%.

4186,"I'm not talking about news not being about nice things in life, I'm talking about quality. 

How are news even ""made"" in the first place?

Some real journalists gather information, provide either reuters, their national agency or media outlet with a story. Tgen someone writes a piece or just copy pastes some stuff, if we are lucky we get some solid sources if additional background info is provided (research). Most of these articles are opinion pieces and commentary, yet are not flagged as such in many cases. These ""news"" are subjective and suggestive - some redditors do a better job for free. So why pay for lack of quality if I tgen have to do research myself, just to see if I was fed bullshit by the press?

Back in the days this was tge same but we had no internet to find out that we were reading bs articles. This has changed. So ofc people are less willing to pay for something that does not live up to their standards.

In any other industry, people would say you are an idiot for paying for bad product and service - yet when it comes to media we are to ignore that and just pay? I don't think so.

Soon, all you want to write here on reddit needs to go through that filter and if there's a hint of ""maybe when he says this thing is such a bomb"" he means to bomb everyone -&gt; not going to get published.

&gt;Liberalism, whilst writing marvellous Declarations of Rights on a piece of paper which practically nobody read -among other reasons, because the people were not even taught to read-; whilst Liberalism was writing these declarations, it was making us spectators of the most inhuman sight ever witnessed- in the greatest cities of Europe, in capitals of States with the finest liberal institutions, human beings, brothers of ours, were being huddled together in formless, horrifying black or red houses, shackled by want and by the tuberculosis and anaemia of hungry children, and enduring every so often the sarcasm of being told that they were free and sovereign to boot. 

-

&gt;... Later, there came the loss of the spiritual unity of peoples, for as the system worked by achievement of majorities, every object that the system set itself to gain had to obtain a majority of the votes. And it had to obtain them by stealing them, if necessary, from the other parties; and for this reason it had to have no hesitation in calumniating them, in heaping upon them the vilest obloquies, in deliberately falsifying the truth, in not letting slip a single means of lying and vilification. And thus, fraternity being one of the postulates displayed before our eyes on the title- page of the Liberal State, there has never been a collective condition of life in which wronged men, at enmity one with another, have ever fell themselves less fraternal than in the turbulent and unpleasant life of the Liberal State. 

&gt;Finally, the Liberal State carne to involve us in economic slavery, for the workers were told, with tragic sarcasm: ""You are free to work as you wish; no-one can compel you to accept these conditions or those; very well then, as we are the rich, we offer you the conditions we think fit; you, as free citizens, are not obliged to accept them if you do not want to; but you, as poor citizens, if you do not accept the conditions that we impose upon you, will die of starvation, surrounded by the greatest degree of Liberal dignity.""

somehow I don't remember any such things, give me proof that they did because I seriously doubt that 

&gt;As for why having NATO members on their border would harm Russia, it dramatically alters the balance of power.

how exactly, by not allow Russia to invade its neighbors without much greater consequences? By not allowing Moscow to treat Eastern Europe as their personal slaves, like how Soviets did? I thought Russia was different than USSR that it replaced.

It was clear that how Soviets did things was not going to allowed to happen again, and Russia would be treated as a equal partner and a ally if they agreed to treat their neighbors like a proper European power should (not like how 19th century imperialist country did). But Russia refused, they still wanted to treat Poland, Ukraine and Baltics and Georgia like Soviets did : completely disregarding what those nations want, and instead forcing their boot down their throat with no remorse (and invading them in case they resist). And then they act all surprised when EU and West is not OK with such behavior. Regional bullies in Europe wont be tolerated anymore , that was made clear in 90's.

Google News in Spain

Click here for the Spanish version

We regret to inform you that Google News has closed in Spain and that the publications of Spanish publishers no longer appear in Google News, following the recent changes in Spanish legislation. We understand that users like you may be unhappy with this new situation and therefore we want to explain the reasons why we have made this decision.

Google News is a free service, used and appreciated by millions of users around the world and is currently available in more than 70 international editions and in 35 languages. It includes everything from national newspapers, to small local publications, specialized media and blogs. Publishers can choose if they want their articles to appear in Google News or not and, for compelling reasons, the vast majority opts for inclusion. Google News creates a real value for these publications by directing user traffic to their websites, which in turn helps them generate advertising revenue.

After the approval of the reform of the Intellectual Property Law we had to close the Google News service in Spain. This new legislation obliges any Spanish publication to charge, whether or not, services like Google News for showing the slightest fragment of their publications. Given that Google News is a service that does not generate revenue (we do not show advertising on the website), this new approach is simply unsustainable.

From Google we will continue to maintain our commitment to help and work with the information sector, as well as with our thousands of partners around the world, including those in Spain, to help them increase their readership and revenue on the Internet.

It seems that you are trying to access the Spanish edition of Google News. If you were trying to access a different edition, you can find it here .

Google News in Spain

We regret that due to changes in Spanish law, Spanish publishers are not featured in Google News and Google News is closed in Spain.

We understand that readers like you may be disappointed, and we want to share the reasons behind this decision.

What's Google News?

Google News is a news and magazine reading app for Android, iOS, and the web that allows users to discover more of the content they love.

What can publishers choose?

Publishers choose whether or not they want their articles to appear in Google News, and the vast majority choose to be included for very good reason. Content in Google News comes from pulling feeds publishers provide to and from crawling the web. Google News creates real value for these publications by driving people to their websites, which in turn can generate revenue revenue.

What are the reasons behind this decision?
Legislation in Spain requires every Spanish publication to charge services like Google News for showing even the smallest snippet from their publications, whether they want to or not.

This approach is not sustainable for Google News.

Our commitment

We remain committed to helping the news industry meet challenges and look forward to working with our thousands of partners globally, as well as in Spain, to help them increase their online readership and revenues.

If you're a former user of Google Play Newsstand and are looking to access your news and magazine content, you can do so in the Newsstand web application

Threatening sea lanes? They never tried to stop maritime traffic and economic zones and territorial waters are completely different things.

&gt;These sea lanes are vital to South Korea, Japan, the Philipines, Taiwan and Vietnam. 

They really aren't. China could claim the entire zone without threatening the Japanese sea lanes a bit.

Now if you want to *contain* China then I agree, they are vital.

Freedom of movement when it suits the USA. When Washington wants sanctions than the freedom of movement does not apply.

4486,"&gt; he is Turkish. Stop making things up.

His family is a Jewish convert (Donmehs/Sabetayists) who was born in a convert neighborhood in Thessaloniki, who went to the school built by Semsi Efendi (and was taught by him ) who was one of the pioneers in their community to built several schools to educate their young to teach them Turkish/Ottoman and educate them in every area because they thought they were falling behind. After the Balkan wars when Thessaloniki was lost, some of those schools like Fevziye and Terakki schools (like Sisli Terakki Lisesi) were moved to Istanbul.    
    
And it's not something to be ""ashamed of"" (unless you're racist), it's just that the Thessalonika had a majority of Jewish population and there was about 25-26k Muslim population there (before the Balkan wars) and a big chunk of that muslim population was also Jewish converts (donmehs). (Thessalonika had a major Jewish population since the 15th century and grew with more Jews coming from other European cities later). Our state history later changed that fact, and Ottoman state didn't care about ethnicity and grouped and registered people according to religions helped that.  
     
This is the truth.   
   
Many of the leading Ittihat Terakki/Young Turks characters who were from Thessalonika were the same. When Ittihat Terakki deposed Abdulhamit, they kept him in Thessalonika in Villa Alatini that was owned by Alatini family, one of the richest Jewish families in town.    
   
&gt;There's a difference between Turkmen and Turk.     
    
Yes there is. Actually there is a difference between Turkic (like Turkish) and Turk. In the modern sense, Turk is now everybody who lives under the Turkish flag, even if they aren't Turkic. Like Laz, Cerkez, Kurd, Turk farketmez hepimiz Turkuz kind of this.    
    
Ottoman didn't give a shit about it and didn't like Turks or more like, Turkmens who were the Turkic people that came to Anatolia. And genetically they lost their Turkmen genes as they mixed every generation (they didn't really lose it, they mixed and new mixed sons got mixed again and those mixed and mixed ones mixed again and it went on) but this wasn't limited to Sultans. People were mixed too, because they didn't live in Turkish, Arab, Laz, Armenian etc groups, Ottoman classified them as ""Muslim Millet"" and muslims were muslims, that's it, and they included Greek/Armenian/Georgian/Albanian/Jewish/etc converts among them and mixed.

Before the vote, there was some kind of base text / draft known by all parties involved, and all parties could send in amendments like ""We want to change Article 123 as follows:.......""   
There were a lot of these amendments and some are even depending on each other.  


During the voting process they went through all these amendments and were voting for those individually. So all the base text and the amendments were made public before the vote, so it is not like the MEPs didn't have a chance to read the full text before the voting.  


It is just now that we need to wait until someone assembles &amp; posts the final text that consists of the results of all the votes and works in the amendments that were voted for.  


Julia Reda has [examples for the amendments for the two most important articles 11 &amp; 13 on her blog](https://juliareda.eu/2018/09/copyright-showdown/), that gives an impression how the different amendments look like.

1. [read the base text](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&amp;mode=XML&amp;reference=A8-2018-0245&amp;language=EN),

3. check the [voting list](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sed/doc/votingList/(A8-0245_2018).pdf) and go through each entry there, get the result of each vote and then work in the amendments into the base text so you would get the final text.

4515,"&gt;The thing is, when you begin to earn your money on the internet then you should know that the income will fluctuate or even vanish completely. This can be seen on YouTube with the fairly recent ""Adpocalypse"". I do feel sorry for people that loose their job because of this, even if it is not even their fault. But then theres people that work normally for companies and get their money that way and they can loose their jobs too due to outsourcing and lack of money.

Agree up to here.

&gt;What I'm saying is that I do know that some people will loose their jobs over this and I do feel sorry about that, but it was a risky deal to begin with and that it's not gonna be the 'end of the internet' as some people claim.

The issue here is that they're trying to pass a legislation to (potentially, read the legislation) implement a system that is by design skewed towards large right holders without giving any accountability. Imagine if this legislation were in a different industry. Lets say a road was built by your company and you now have the rights to charge a toll for the next 10 years. Then comes another, larger company, that says that they built the road, and that they don't want people to cross through it anymore. With this system your road is immediately closed, no questions asked. Then after fighting against the automatic system you *maybe* get your road back, but its too late, you've lost TONS of revenue. What happens to the company that erroneously and perhaps maliciously claimed to have built your road? Nothing.

Lets now take it form another point of view. Lets say you make a video saying amazing things about Trump and its getting a lot of attention. Lets say there's a group of people who don't like you talking about Trump that way. Lets say these people claim your video and ask for it to be taken down. You fight to get it back up, but its too late, your window of opportunity is gone, no one is paying attention now.

There's tons of articles describing what I'm saying now, you can read on it more if you google. Sure, its not as bleak as some people make it look like (not all pages need to implement these systems, but the law as it is written now is too vague, so it leaves too much room for (mis)interpretation), but its not in a state that should be passed.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/9f53yw/europe_votes_on_a_controversial_law_that_could/e5u4m7i/,-Larothus-,1536749283

4529,"Macrons interview with Speigel about Europe is relevant here

http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/interview-with-french-president-emmanuel-macron-a-1172745.html


&gt;DER SPIEGEL: Why is this narrative so important?

&gt;Macron: I think we need it badly! Why is a portion of our youth so fascinated by extremes, jihadism for example? Why do modern democracies refuse to allow their citizens to dream? Why can't there be such a thing as democratic heroism? Perhaps exactly that is our task: rediscovering something like that together for the 21st century.

&gt;DER SPIEGEL: You have proposed the establishment of new institutions and the simplification of procedures. But isn't Europe's problem more that everyone seems intent on pursuing their own interests?

&gt;Macron: What I am proposing is to start a new chapter in Europe. To begin this adventure anew, and differently, if you'd like. The institutions as such aren't particularly important to me - and I think most people feel the same. The problem is that debates over Europe have become disputes between experts and lawyers. Yet Europe was initially supposed to be primarily a political project! The EU never would have come about had it been up to experts or diplomats. It was created by people who had learned from the drama of our collective history. I am proposing a new beginning, not one in which it is first deliberated ad infinitum what instruments one needs, but one that follows from the goals we want to achieve. What do we want? What should our Europe look like? I want to renew the European dream and reawaken ambitions for it.

&gt;DER SPIEGEL: What does the Europe you dream of look like?

&gt;Macron: For me, Europe consists of three things: sovereignty, unity and democracy. If we keep our eyes on these goals and work toward them together then - and only then - can we fulfill our promise: the guarantee of lasting peace, prosperity and freedom. Let's put an end to this European civil war, the existence of which we don't want to admit, and stop constantly looking at whether we are better than our neighboring country at this or the other thing. We have to be open to new things, and that includes things that have been taboo until now: France still insists that the treaties cannot be changed. Germany doesn't want any financial transfers. We have to leave these old ways of thinking behind.

&gt;DER SPIEGEL: What does that mean concretely?

&gt;Macron: I think the goal should be that of creating a space that protects us and helps us survive in this world. The European community of values is unique: It combines democracy with the market economy, individual freedoms with social justice. How can we expect the U.S. or China to defend these values, this one-of-a-kind European balancing act that has developed over the course of decades? The challenges are manifold, issues such as migration or terrorism are important to us all. But the switch to renewable sources of energy must also be planned together. And last, but not least, there is digitalization and the societal change that goes along with it. We can only have success on all those fronts if we move forward together.

Albanoi
Albanoi or Albani were an Illyrian tribe whose first historical account appears in a work of Ptolemy in addition to a town called Albanopolis located east of the Ionian sea, in modern-day Albania. Ptolemy's mention in 150 AD places them in the Roman province of Macedon, specifically in Epirus Nova, almost 300 years after the Roman conquest of the region. Ptolemy himself makes no hint of their true ethnic identification, and he does not clarify whether the citizens of Albanopolis were Illyrians, Macedonians or Thracians, all of which are distinct possibilities. However from the names of places with which Albanopolis is connected, it appears clearly to have been in the southern part of the Illyrian territory, and in the center of modern Albania, an area inhabited by the Illyrians at the time.",,/r/europe/comments/9ewhvj/north_macedonias_recognised_name/e5txxru/,pasha6a,1536734945

4718,"&gt; So according to you stuff is being produced in Germany rather than other places because companies have already made the investment in Germany.

No, I said that this might be one of the reasons. There might be many more reasons, plenty of them I might be unaware.

&gt;So companies just didn't know that things would be cheaper when they made the initial investment? How long ago would that be? The market has been open for decades and the vast majority of production has already been outsourced (not to Greece, though).

Reasons for making factory somewhere and reason for its continued existence might be two completely different things.

&gt;You're right that it takes a while for another country to catch up economically when some historic reason previously prevented them from doing so.

But I didn't said anything like that. I said that prices are driven by people willing to spend money on something (i.e., the price of item and number of people willing to spend money on it). And people are willing to spend money on something based on their salary and price of other items. Nowhere there is any productivity (it is hidden indirectly in salary, but salary is based on willingness of people to work for money, so productivity is there, but hidden very deep). Often, prices for the same product differ in different region because they are marketed differently (and no, this does not include price of marketing). Often, the same item made in the same factory with the same ingredient is sold under different brands and prices to give illusion of choice to customer. This completely negate the meaning of productivity in your case as anything but some currency gained recalculated to some other currency. But often, values of currencies are based on willingness of people to invest into said currency and the amount of that currency around (nicely demonstrated with bitcoins). So while this definition of productivity, amount of currency gained for action X, is valid, it cannot be used to measure laziness or quality of work of different people (because, the same people would be even more productive if they moved to Germany).

&gt;You need to tone down the rhetoric by the way, you're not being very reasonable calling everyone naive idiots who doesn't subscribe to your idea of economics.

But thats not what I said. I said that naive economic theories, or their naive interpretation, assume that all inequalities are solved by the free market, because if someone is trying to make prices too high, you will get subject with smaller prices, which will correct this market. Essentially, that free market is self-correcting system. And many people have this idea, lot of people around ancap (anarchistic capitalism) are writing about this when they critique state monopolis in various sectors. Our former president, himself economist, idealized capitalismus after fall of communism in ČR in this way. I didn't call anyone idiot, I called them naive or having a naive understanding of problem, not idiots as you are trying to straw-man. The problem with this understanding is that it ignores one particular thing: barriers. There are multiple barriers that prevents this behaviour. The market isn't flexible enough and people are not reacting immediately. They are not a completely rational actors. So when someone increases prices of some product, you would need to do a lot of things to get your product out, having huge starting capital is one of these things. And it would take people a long time to react on this. And you would have to get your unknown product into shops in the first place. And economy of scales says that their product might have still a bit cheaper production cost. So there you have it. Its naive because it is a basic for simple models that can help you in understanding. But it is by no way good description of realistic behaviour.

&gt;I didn't study economics, but you sure as hell didn't either.

It doesn't matter what I studied. What matters is if I am right or not. I studied biology and mathematical modeling and you can see a lot of similar concepts in living systems. A new species might be a better in almost everything, but it might never out-compete the species that is well entrenched in its niche.",,/r/europe/comments/9eztz5/european_countries_by_average_amount_of_hours/e5txzly/,Unicorn_Colombo,1536735046

That was more like how politicians thought since Homo Sapiens exists. There were some Habsburgs who payed their debts and fulfilled their duties [Albert I. (as king of Hungary) comes to my mind], and there were Habsburgs, who were assholes. Sometimes they were both, like in the case of Rudolf I. He was a pretty good Kaiser, protecting subjects and all, but before that he was the most rapacious, disgusting powermongerer noble imaginable.

4861,"&gt;Ertugrul Gazi and Osman Bey were Turkmens (probably already mixing but still keeping up with the Ghazi tradition) but Orhan's wife (Sultan Murad I's mother) was Horofira, a Byzantian, Bayezid's mother was Bulgarian Maria Hatun, Chelebi Mehmed I's mother Bulgar Olga Hatun, Fatih Sultan Mehmed's mother Huma Hatun, also known as Stella from Italy ( There are two traditions or theories on her origin: that she was an Italian woman named Stella, perhaps a Jewess; or that she was Serbian, Ilber Ortayli support that she was of Slavic descent., and Ilber Ortayli probably went with the Serbian theory because in this society he probably was scared to call their favorite ""ecdad""s mother a Jew, anyway who cares Jewish or Serbian, then Sultan Yavuz's mother the daughter of a Pontus-Greek-converted-to-Islam from Trabzon named Ayşe Hatun, then there's Hafta Sultan the mother of Suleyman who was a convert, some say she was Jewish, then the most famous of all, Hurrem Sultan also known as Roxelana from Poland, also rumored to be Jewish or daughter of an Orthodox priest who was the mother of Selim II, and the list goes on. There is literally not one Turkish mother in the family line after Orhan, it's Rum, Greek, Armenian, Jewish, Circassian, Russian, Serbian, Italian, they're all over the place, you should check it out yourself..

WOW people. Nobles are not pure they're mixed. It means they're not Turks but something else. 

Love this logic.

&gt;There is literally not one Turkish mother in the family line after Orhan

wrong

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mothers_of_the_Ottoman_sultans

also mothers of sultans do not matter. they're irrelevant. unless you talk about their genetics.

&gt;Basically he put all the Empire's muslim millet in the Turk basket, just like how today they say ""Laz, Cerkez, Turk, Kurt hepimiz Turkuz"". So ""Turk"" is basically given a whole new definition in modern Turkey.

Nope. The ethnic meaning of Turk is still here. But Turk now has the second meaning: Civic.  

It's that simple. No need to write an essay.

&gt;I know you'd love to believe you're a pure grey wolf coming from Oghuz Khan and Gokturks 

No I'd not. And I don't.

I actually know a lot about genetics. I doubt you know about genetics as much as I do. So let's avoid this genetic talk. Because whenever I argue with people, I post studies. And you know what? They don't even read them. So don't even bother me with that.

&gt;but I suggest take a day off and sit on a bench on one of the big streets in Istanbul and just watch people, look at their faces, their cheekbones, facial structures and see if they look all the same. Then take out your phone and google pictures of ""central asian turks"" and see if they look any similar to what you see on the street. Most you'll see on the street is middleeastern or meditterannean looking man and women, mostly with dark hair and complexion, some more different than that..

You literally posted a Black rapper to show that ""average Turks look like this"".  So I doubt you know anything about what Turks look like. So let's avoid this talk all together.

and, central asians are not all Chinese looking people (probably what you think).

&gt;I wonder which study I skipped that shows Anatolian Turks were 100% Turkic people from Siberia.

Skipped? No. You just took a sentence and posted it here. Doubt you read the whole page

By the way have you read Conflict Armament Research's Weapons of the Islamic State report, it traced 40,000 pieces of artillery and weapons that the islamic state had used in Iraq, it found that vast quantities of weapons used by ISIS had been purchased from Eastern Europe by a US company called Keisler Police Supply on US army export licenses in 2014 and 2015 and somehow diverted to ISIS completely disproving the unproven theory that ISIS simply obtained Iraq army and police weaponry when they took Iraq which is the usual retort when the source of the Syrian and Iraqi jihadis weapons is questioned

Europe has significantly more room to grow than the USA. EU28 includes various developing countries with a significantly lower gdp per capita than the USA, the EU should be growing much faster than the US full stop. For your reference, gdp per capita is typically used to measure the level of development internationally, not as a comparison of growth. 

EU debt is also increasing, and let's not forget that the central European bank's interest rate hasn't been adjusted upwards since 2011, the individual members may be maintaining their current debt levels but the central bank has been buying bonds like there's no tomorrow while still conducting quantitative easing. 

Most countries in Europe, including the major players, have a gdp to debt ratio that is almost exactly the same as the USA.

Wages in the USA are growing now believe it or not, there are 650,000 more open positions than people looking for jobs according to the wsj as of the 7th, wages increased in July and then again in August, both times well over 2%. I'm not familiar with how wages are doing in Europe so if you could educate me I'd appreciate it. 

If you bothered to read the article I posted you'd see that in Europe imports grew literally twice as fast as exports, and yet you want to focus on the USA? Why? Shouldn't you be more concerned about your own wellbeing? 

Im sorry if I think that your prediction is simply bullshit. The US economy may be in the early stages of overheating, but that's about it so far and even that seems to be largely false as wages are at last growing and the US economy is primarily driven by domestic consumption (75% vs. 50% in the EU).

Where did I make use of emotional language?  Where did I try and change the subject?

&gt; Are you going to share about how France squashes local resentment and pro-independence?  Or how France will never allow this to happen?

This is whataboutism.  A logical fallacy.  

We can talk about it but that would change the topic.

I don't really have a strong stance one way or another on the issue of independence for Catalonia.  But I do believe strongly in democracy.

I just think it's important to call someone out when they pretend to speak for someone else and call them crybabies while simultaneously pretending as if Catalans have never experienced oppression when the facts, even from recent history, clearly say otherwise.

Perhaps if your government weren't so incompetent, you could've avoided alienating the majority of people in your wealthiest region.

There was a chronic lack of supplies in general and the prison camps were not high in the priority list. Thus the conditions in the camps were really bad. Thousands died of diseases. Around a thousand prisoners were shot for various reasons. 

Back to your claims: The clear truth is that the US military has abysmally bad track record in policing its own troops. Like i already said only around thirty were convicted in Vietnam for hundreds of confirmed war crimes. And since they confirmed only a small portion of all possible crimes the percentage is even smaller. And like I said while some of them got some years in prison all of them were let out after months.

You gave one graveyard with less than hundred people. Out of all American troops in Europe during ww2. And notably the people in the graveyard you noted seem to be there for killing their allies or other Americans.

You're wrong. It is feasible in some rich countries to work part-time in large measure because compensation is high. In poorer countries, part-time work is not nearly as renumerative, hence they have a higher share of full-time work.

This means that wages on an *hourly* basis is what determines working hours to some extent, given that it provides flexibility to workers where compensation is high. Therefore, countries with lower hours will have better working conditions. So the map is still instructive.

""order to have stealth capabilities, the plane is painted with a special, incredibly expensive paint. This paint peels off if the plane is in an area with more than 0% humidity, so the planes have to be kept in expensive climate-controlled hangars.""

This is definitely not true in the slightest.
The only RAM really ever applied during maintainace is around the hatches after they are accessed. And it's not even a paint it's a tape.
The rest of the RAM is what's called Fibermatt. It's a Carbon nanotubes structure that is doped with the RAM material and baked into a composite (like carbonfiber) panel on the skin of the aircraft. So it only needs repairs if it's physically damaged. It provides broadband EM signatures reduction in addition to the f-35s stealth shaping. 
This results in the F-35 being the sealthiest plane flying today.

5023,"Across Turkey’s southern border, Bashar Assad’s criminal regime has for seven years targeted Syria’s citizens with arbitrary arrests, systematic torture, summary executions, barrel bombs, and chemical and conventional weapons. As a result of the Syrian civil war, which the United Nations Human Rights Council calls “the worst man-made disaster since World War II,” millions of innocent people have become refugees or been internally displaced.


Turkey has gone to extraordinary lengths to alleviate suffering of the Syrian people, hosting some 3.5 million refugees—more than any other country in the world. At the same time we have become the target of terrorist organizations operating next door: the so-called Islamic State and the PKK. Neither the heavy cost of humanitarian efforts nor security concerns have weakened our resolve.


As Turkey faced those challenges, it made diplomatic efforts to find a political solution. We have brought the Syrian opposition to the negotiating table in Geneva and launched the Astana process alongside Russia and Iran. Consequently, Turkey was able to broker cease-fires, create de-escalation zones, and evacuate civilians from areas under regime attack. 

Today we find ourselves at a critical juncture again, as the Assad regime, with the help of its allies, prepares to launch a massive offensive against Idlib, which is home to some three million people and one of the few remaining safe havens for internally displaced Syrians. In an attempt to prevent the assault, my government contributed to the creation of a deconfliction zone and set up 12 observation posts to document and report cease-fire violations. 


The Assad regime seeks to legitimize its imminent attack on counterterrorism grounds. Make no mistake: No country appreciates the need to combat terrorism better than Turkey, which has suffered severely from terrorist attacks since the Syrian conflict began exporting insecurity throughout the region. But Bashar Assad’s solution is a false one. Innocent people must not be sacrificed in the name of fighting terrorism. This will only create new hotbeds of terrorism and extremism. The rise of ISIS was an outcome—not the cause—of what was happening in Syria. The international community must contain such violence to stop terrorism from taking root.

In Idlib, we face similar challenges. Certain designated terrorist organizations, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, remain active in this area. Yet those fighters account for a fraction of Idlib’s population. In order to eliminate terrorist and extremist elements in Idlib and to bring to justice foreign fighters, a more comprehensive international counterterrorism operation is necessary. Moderate rebels played a key role in Turkey’s fight against terrorists in Northern Syria; their assistance and guidance will be crucial in Idlib as well. 

Preventing the assault on Idlib need not set back counterterrorism efforts. Turkey has succeeded in fighting terrorist groups, including ISIS and the PKK, without harming or displacing civilians. In order to restore some level of stability to affected areas, dozens of Turkish servicemen and servicewomen have lost their lives. Turkey’s ability to maintain order in Northern Syria is proof that a responsible approach to counterterrorism can win hearts and minds.

All members of the international community must understand their responsibilities as the assault on Idlib looms. The consequences of inaction are immense. We cannot leave the Syrian people to the mercy of Bashar Assad. The purpose of a regime offensive against Idlib would be indiscriminate attacks to wipe out its opposition—not a genuine or effective campaign against terrorism. A regime assault would also create serious humanitarian and security risks for Turkey, the rest of Europe and beyond. 

It is crucial for the U.S., which has concentrated on chemical attacks, to reject its arbitrary hierarchy of death. Conventional weapons are responsible for far more deaths. But the obligation to stop the next bloodshed is not the West’s alone. Our partners in the Astana process, Russia and Iran, are likewise responsible for stopping this humanitarian disaster.





Idlib is the last exit before the toll. If the international community, including Europe and the U.S., fail to take action now, not only innocent Syrians but the entire world stands to pay the price. Turkey has done everything in its power to stop the bloodshed next door. To ensure that we succeed, the rest of the world must set aside narrow self-interest and throw its weight behind a political solution.

Mr. Erdoğan is president of Turkey.

First of all, it's not a new thing, we have declared independence 4 times and been technically independent for long periods during the Habsburg kingdome (which we lost on 11 september of 1714 with all our institutions, our national day). Our language, culture and literature dates many centuries back, romans started this, and the ""senyera"", our official flag, is one of the oldest of Europe, as our parlamient who have 131 presidents perfectly registered. Catalonia have allways fought against slavery and abuse in general (catalan civil war of 1462). Also we have been heavily oppressed in the XX century, during the Primo de Rivera and Franco dictatorships, that where very very anti-catalan both where hundreds of thousands were murdered. After that they just transitioned in 1976 and never practically ended. Fascism in Spain wasn't defeated at all, it just ""died"" in bed after 40 years and suddenly all country turned very democratic, right.

5129,"Honest answer?

To me, Scottish independentists are much more sympathetic. While there are certainly some nutbags over there, the Scots have generally a much more nuanced view on the independence issue. They don't deny the potential economic troubles it might cause, they don't *really* believe to be oppressed, they *generally* don't actively spread hate against other Brits and they are much more inclusive and less supportive of any strong ethno-nationalistic rhetoric. Scottish nationalism looks highly developed and civil and has very old, deep roots; the independentist question wasn't born out of some recent bickering on minor issues but has grown over time through mature debate and respectable leaders by both sides.

Again, there are nasty people in Scotland for sure, but all in all I tend to respect the local independentists even though I don't agree at all with their cause (as a majority of the Scots, it seems).

On the contrary, Catalan independentists can't help but looking as a bunch of spoilt insufferable crybabies who basically had it all but for some reason have suddenly decided to rewrite history, deny the blatant truth and support a very toxic and divisive ideology which is often dangerously close to a call for actual ethnic cleansing, and generally don't have any idea of what they are actually doing. Like, some random politician once said something slightly bad about us, OMG WE ARE SOOO OPPRESSED! Please, do grow up. If only they dropped the 'oppression' part (which, honestly, no one sane can buy) I feel they would already be much more popular.

The whole referendum fiasco last year has been a long embarassing shitshow. The [Help Catalonia.

I think the most alarming aspect of this article is not the sub-par growth Europe is experiencing, but the fact that imports are increasing twice as fast as exports.  Europe is dependent upon trade for external resources in ways that the USA, China and Russia are not -- this is bad because Europe is largely dependent on the USA to maintain the global trading system (not trying to be hurr durr 'murica, this is the reality of the situation) and as we have learned from President Trumps' first term all it takes is one administration to upend the status quo, leaving Europe with very means with which to defend their interests.

Saying that a no-deal would be acceptable is not the same as saying that you have no preference either way.  Given that I am quite sure that there are potential arrangements that are mutually-beneficial relative to no-deal, there *should* be preference for a deal, if that deal ia the right one.

But if a deal cannot be reached with the whole, in areas where the EU does not have exclusive competency, EU members can reach their own arrangements, publicly or privately.  That's not an option for trade, which is and should be exclusively the domain of the EU, but it can be for other areas.

There are Britons in Spain and Spaniards in Britain.  Uprooting them would be, to my mind, senseless and harmful for both Spain and the UK.  In fact, if nothing else were possible, I'd suggest that both Britain and Spain should just unilaterally grant the ability to stay to most or all.  But they probably benefit from coming to a bilateral agreement versus having to act unilaterally.

And the bar for reaching such an arrangement is much lower.  There's no Wallonia-blocks-CETA sort of situations that way.

5202,"&gt; Germany lost much of its territory, people and cities. It got divided into two countries of which one was subject to a communist regime.

The Soviets did not treat the Germans well, but the rest if the Allies did, something that cannot be said about the treatment of other European countries.

&gt; I don't think Germany gained an economic advantage by destroying Greece.

I said the Germany benefited by the London Debt Agreement(LDA)
You replied ""I don't think Germany gained an economic advantage by destroying Greece."" 

https://academic.oup.com/ereh/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ereh/hey010/4995332
&gt; The London Debt Agreement (LDA) eliminated half of West Germany’s external debt. Subsequent years witnessed unprecedented economic growth. The LDA likely contributed to economic growth by creating fiscal space for public investment and social spending, restoring the full convertibility of the Deutsche Mark, and stabilising inflation. The LDA was associated with a substantial and statistically significant rise in real per capita social expenditure relative to other spending categories. Synthetic control methods also show that under the counterfactual of no debt relief, overall expenditure might have been lower by 17 percent. The LDA also facilitated the reintegration of Germany into global markets and full convertibility of the Deutsche Mark by catalysing accumulation of sufficient US-Dollar reserves.
[...]
Our  analysis  provides  evidence  consistent  with  the  idea  that  the  LDA  contributed  to
accelerating economic growth, by freeing resources for domestic investment and stabilising
German finances.  The  LDA  helped  pave  the  way  for  the“Wirtschaftwunder” or “The Miracle on the Rhine”.

All these guesses are a miss. It boils down to the rate of part time workers. Thanks to various factors it is rather high in Germany: Comparatively high compensation makes living on a part time salary feasible. In most parts of the country it’s still customary for the wife to go part time when after the first child. Thanks to Agenda 2010 and similar laws there are lots of pseudo-jobs that are only worked on demand. (Because “strict worker protection” is largely fictional these days.

&gt;My claim: ""They participated in the Olympics (which were Greek only) [...] long before Philip II""

&gt;Proof: Alexander I and Archelaus I participated in the Olympics before the time of Philip II, as we can see in the texts of Herodotus (Histories 5.22) and Solinus (Polyhistor 9.15).

This is only evidence that those two people participated. It cannot be extrapolated to the whole nation.

&gt;My claim: ""[They] spoke Greek [...] long before Philip II""

&gt;Proof: The vast majority of the names, toponyms etc. were Greek. They had Greek etymologies.

&gt;Alexander, Archelaus, Macedonia, Amphipolis, Philip and so on are all Greek words. Why would a people name its children, its land and its cities using words of a different language than its own? Again, it's not just some words, but almost all of them, if not all.

The Macedonian upper classes had a different language before the 4th century BC when they adopted Attic Greek. My name comes from Hebrew and Latin but that doesn't mean I'm Jewish or Italian.

&gt;My claim: ""[They] worshiped Greek gods (who were even said to live on Mt. Olympus, here in Macedonia) ... long before Philip II""

&gt;Proof: The town of Dion was a place of worship of the Olympian Gods. They were called Olympians because they lived on Mt. Olympus. If you need proof that Olympus is in Macedonia, well, look at a map.

Over 4 billion people worship the god of Abraham. Who would claim they are all of the same nationality?

&gt; My claim: ""[They] had a Greek culture (art, architecture etc.) ... long before Philip II""

&gt; Proof: Looking up ancient Macedonian art and buildings is enough. The columns are Greek, the mosaics are Greek, the statues are Greek, the pottery is Greek etc.

When the Renaissance started, did everyone who participate become Greek and Roman? Neighbouring cultures will always share features.

5353,"&gt;Well sure. In an ""el Pais"" article, which has a pro-Spain bias, with a DIY demonstration-counting-tool. I mean, no thanks.

The article makes a point of criticizing everyone claiming that they got 1 million people together, whether left- or right-wing. The article cites a French company as helping them with their research. But whatever. 

&gt;She is? You just said that Podemos is not for independence, which is it?

As you said above, supporting the ""political prisoners"" is not pro-independence, but it is nevertheless an statement of political sympathy/agreement with you guys. Hence me saying she was not FULLY neutral today. 

&gt;The Ofrena Floral carries no such connotation, it's their own problem if they don't go.

I agree that the Ofrena Floral is non-partisan. However, [here](https://youtu.be/Vh0rPAOPwbU) you have the MHP Torra using the yearly Diada speech (which should be institutional) as a political speech: ""we want to proclaim the republic"", ""fight against opression [of the Spanish State]"", ""political prisoners"", ""fight for your freedom [from Spain], and a very long etcetera. But sure, the independentists have always maintained institutional neutrality, it's the unionists who politicize everything. 

&gt;Again nope. CSQP in the last elections actively denied positioning themselves in one camp or the other.

Huh, CSQP maybe, due to the weird coalition they do. But Podemos (as a party) is opposed to independence (not to referendum and etc.). 

&gt;Well sure, now SCC claims that this demonstration had 200k people even if 435k went for sure because they signed up for, and ignored the majority that just showed up. What I'm saying is, it's very likely that there were at least a million people today.

You are misunderstanding me or else I am misunderstanding you. You said ""there were 350k people in unionist demonstrations, very short of our one million"", and I said ""sure, 350k seems a reasonable number, unlike what the organizers of the demonstrations claimed"".

 I did not say SCC saying there were X people is today's demonstration was correct or not, in fact as far as I know they have not given numbers. So I think you got me wrong there.

Politicians across Europe all pretty much believe the same US-inspired neoliberal ideology regardless of how alienated it is from their voters.

Catalan separatism is just part of a global pattern of anxiety over cultural identity which is driving a resurgence in nationalist feeling throughout much of the world. 

Except in Catalonia it's also worsened by the overwhelming omnipresence of Spanish culture, the minority position of the Catalan language relative to Spanish and the large scale immigration of people from outside Catalonia who don't care for Catalan identity and have now coalesced around a party explicitly opposed to the special status of Catalan and autonomy of Catalonia.

5398,"&gt; It veers more to the Asian side while Russia veers more towards the European side.

Actually half of my family lives in Russia and I know Russia quite a bit. Russia is no different to Turkey how you describe, each region has their own culture and the regions differ far more than Turkey, whereas in Turkey majority of the people in Turkey are ethnic Turks while in regions of Russia you have different ethnic compositions. Russia has way bigger differences than Turkey. 

Russia is not only St. Petersburg or Moscow, most people imagine all of Russia to be the same as those two cities.

&gt;Izmir or Istanbul wouldn't be out of place in Southern Europe but the rest of the country (ie most of it) is markedly different culturally from the rest of Europe.

There is no collective European culture, I know that you realize culture throughout Europe differs vastly, north and south comparisons being the most striking. Even huge variations between Balkan countries, southern countries, etc. Some of these cultures, you would even find to appear ""middle eastern"" but that is meaningless.

&gt;Also ME =/= Arabs.

ME is associated with Arabs and Muslims by almost everyone. Why do you think Armenians, Assyrians, Iranians and other people get pissed off? Armenians and Assyrians especially hate that label as do Georgians. Fact of the matter is, most the world does not know anything about the Middle East, especially considering this ""Middle East"" is a modern political label and it is really Southwest Asia. Southwest Asian cultures themselves differ greatly between nation groups, no different to Europe.

There is no collective Middle Eastern culture.

&gt;From what I understand, Iranians, Afghans and Pakistanis (though South Asian) are big fans of the Turks.

I don't know about Aghans, but no, Iranians do not like Turks and there are historic rivalries. Pakistanis are the only group that I know who like Turks among the ones you mentioned, and not all of them.

If you're electing representatives to make decisions for you then it's not very democratic. That aside, a gov'ts obligations only go as far as what the law tells them to do.

&gt;The force used by the police was unprovoked. ""If clashes did occur..."", they did. ""...it's very likely that Catalan protesters refused to obey police orders..."", which is NOT a laid reason to resort to violence.

If you start pushing into riot officers that are preventing you from entering a street or a building or whatever you should be prepared to get pushed back. In practice riot officers *need* to exert some kind of force in order to contain riots and agitated crowds.

&gt;Burning pictures of leaders is not a crime in a modern democratic society. Waving flags and chanting slogans is also not a crime. The violence was unjustified.

It's not a crime, but it perfectly captures the circumstances. There's a crowd full of angry nationalists. People in groups tend to conform to the crowd and lose their inhibition. The nationalist crowd is so pissed off it starts to burn images of the people it hates.

5453,"Maybe it's because I was raised bilingual (French/English) but it pisses me the fuck off to see everyone giving in to using English for everything more and more. Majority of IT, certain sciences, all of business, etc. The less you use your own freaking language in these environments the less useful your language will be because it won't naturally develop the terminology (or even take loanwords) as fields progress... eventually it will be totally useless in certain industries because the vocabulary will just be too cumbersome. 

This is one of the reasons I find English higher education in European countries incredibly annoying. If you don't even bother to teach advanced subjects your language just shifts into being a zombie language... which is essentially what I'd say languages like Dutch are getting awful close to.

I once worked for a small venture capitalist firm in Paris and they refused to even look at candidates that didn't speak perfect English *even though we only invested in FRANCE*. The douchebag manager just wanted to brag about his English-speaking office. Naturally it didn't lead to a super productive environment...

But it doesn't stop at that, it mistakes EU core values with political left values.

It would have been a good chance to pressure Hungary into changing back the worst structural changes, but not with a document that basically says conservativism is against the core values of the EU.

And what facts should affect my position here?

5568,"The historian I cited before has another excellent summary.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4wsix2/was_alexander_the_great_greek/d69muq7/

&gt; The evidence we have suggests that the Greekness of the kings of Macedon was debated. Isokrates, in his speech to Philip II, stresses again and again that Philip is a child of Argos, but of course the speech is meant to flatter him and legitimise his claims. Herodotos (5.22) claims to have proof that the Macedonian royal line is Greek, but never presents it. He tells the story that Alexander I of Macedon was allowed to partake in the Olympic Games, which implies that his Greekness was accepted - but he notes that many Greeks actually wished to bar Alexander from the games on the grounds that he was a barbarian and not a Greek. In short, we get the impression from the literary evidence that the supposed Greekness of the royal line was at best controversial.

&gt; By the time of Alexander III, the Macedonian elite had certainly picked up a number of very Greek habits; Alexander himself enjoyed the tutelage of Aristotle, a Thracian Greek educated at Athens, who no doubt imbued him with Greek values and probably taught him to speak Attic Greek. On the other hand, many Macedonian customs (such as drinking unmixed wine) very much singled them out as barbarians. On such points, too, the Greeks at the time probably could not agree.

Ancient history is not black and white.

5642,"&gt;At the same time, chances are that it will eventually get watered down enough to be palatable.

I hate this argument because it's simply not true.

This whole thing is so vile because those behind it only gain something if the big fish (aka google&amp;YT, facebook&amp;instagram (and whatsapp to an extent), reddit, twitter and so on) filter their content to sort out ""copyrighted"" things. For them to do that with the masses of uploads per minute that are happening, the blanket filters will always be the logical consequence.

There is no watering down here. Either you force them to do it (which is not """"""palatable"""""") or you don't. There is simply never enough processing power for this kind of thing not to mention the absurd false negative/positive rate on these things if not done manually. 

And whats even worse is that a Copyright reform is desperately needed yes... But with restrictions in the opposite direction. As you said in your last paragraph, things like Sony trying to claim they copyrighted Bach shouldn't be able to go completely unpunished. Copyright (at least digitally) runs mostly on a ""guilty until proven innocent"" basis. This ""Reform"" will only amplify that which is the wrong direction no matter how much you dilute it.

5683,"Several people have mentioned the issues of youth unemployment in Italy being a concern.

I've not read much on the Italian labor market -- a few *Economist* articles a decade back, a couple of podcasts, none of which talked much specifically about the youth employment market.

This article is the first time that I've read anything claiming that youth unemployment is due to concerns in education; it complains that fresh university graduates are not always well-prepared for the specific jobs they do, but also says that youth unemployment varies radically between north and south, and has youth unemployment that isn't especially high in the north.

If university education is *actually* a factor, then I'd expect the universities that people attend to differ greatly between the north and the south.  That seems odd; generally, one can attend universities wherever one wants (especially in-state, to receive subsidies from the state) in the US, and I'd the vague idea that that was also true elsewhere.

Are Italian university students free to pick-and-choose where in Italy they are educated?  That is, do they need to go to university in their particular region, or can they go wherever they want?  If some universities are legitimately doing a significantly-better job, I'd think that students would tend to go to them and that this would eliminate any regional differences in youth unemployment.

If private universities are doing better than public universities, are equivalant-value subsidies available to students who want to attend private university?

I can find [numerous](http://www.matching-in-practice.eu/higher-education-in-italy/) other [pages](https://www.jetdencre.ch/what-university-dropout-says-of-education-in-italy-6406) online complaining about the current university system in Italy, but they don't seem to really identify one or two core issues.  They complain about everything from large classes to total funding to placement policy to dropout rates.

If there are significant issues in the Italian university system, why don't Italian students study in, say, French universities?  Language barrier issues?  Lack of access to subsidies if studying outside Italy?

Are there legal barriers to multinational universities spanning EU members?  That is, can a German university open a branch campus in Italy without running afoul of Italian restrictions?

You seem hellbent on arguing about Vukovar, and you purposefully ignore arguments such as:

The Yugoslav Constitution (made by a Slovene Croat btw) FORBADE secession until you have a yes from all the Republics.

That makes the Croatian independence declaration invalid until it got recognition. And when it got recognition the YPA retreated, thus making the war until then a War between Yugoslavs. 

After that, it became a civil war between Krajina Serbs and the Croatian government - a civil war. 

And you can't cry agression when you literally went and carved a piece of Bosnia up. 

&gt; It was an act of foreign aggression and you have to be purposely dishonest not to see it as such. 

How the fuck is it 'foreign' when we were both in Yugoslavia, you're purposefully ignoring that part to fit your agenda.

The Kievan Rus (which would later evolve into Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine) was established by a viking named Rurik, and his dynasty continued to rule over parts of the region for over 700 years.

Iceland was discovered and settled by vikings.

They also attempted to settle Greenland (""Vinland""), but the colony eventually died out.

Complete bullshit. ""ideals for protections of the accused"". You are lying about the ICC due process. These war criminals are in another country. They aren't kidnapping Americans from America.

5995,"I don't think opposing your ideas of ""collective guilt of an entire race"" is nipicking. 

If China had a democratically elected government *maybe* you'd have something vaguely resembling a point, but they don't, they have an authoritative communist dictatorship. An absolute minority of the Chinese people is a member of the communist party and those aren't even uniformly han-Chinese.
And don't get me wrong, I understand your point to some degree I think, evil wins when good men stand idle, and that's true. But I'm not willing as an outsider to collectively judge them **BY RACE** because they aren't all tankmen, that they're afraid for the wellbeing of their families and I can even understand those who're just content to live the status-quo now that Chinese life is much less brutal then a couple decades ago.

So sure each and every person has a moral obligation to oppose tyranny, but they have it each individually. Therefore I judge them on an individual basis.
