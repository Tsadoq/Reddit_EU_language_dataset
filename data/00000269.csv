2,"&gt;So the criminal is the one with a gun who checks; works just as easily if you check for an expensive watch.

There's an easy thing to answer: muggers *don't* actually conduct pat-downs today, despite the potential risk that they're facing someone who is armed.

Muggers — along with smash-and-grab artists, thieves, and so forth — have a pretty strong incemtive to minimize the amount of time they spend at a crime and get away as quickly as possible.  A mugger could pat someone down, but given that they don't know whether someone might have an ankle holster or underarm holster or firearm in a pocket or anything else, doing a lot of messing around exposes themselves to risk.

Even police officers will prefer to do that in pairs, and will not do so until a person is following orders to position themselves to minimize risk.

&gt;The point is that a criminal running away trying to escape doesn't warrant deadly force and US police officers are still permitted to shoot to kill then.

Well, I'd say that's your opinion as to whether it's warranted.  But in the US, they don't: use of deadly force isn't used if the only thing at risk is the person escaping.  Here, it's used to protect the property in question (and it's not specific to police, but to anyone who can use deadly force: the victim, a bystander, whoever).",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7kt8n9/malmo_police_retract_unfortunate_advice_warning/dricnjq/,vokegaf,1513749159

Letting them in in order to enable them to leech off of the taxpayer, likely for generations to come as experience with Hispanic migration in the US has shown (3 of 4 Hispanic households receive welfare of some kind), is simply a dumb, self-destructive goal.

13,"You clearly don't understand how democracy works, or even its most basic concepts...

1. A decision by the country is a decision by the representatives of the people, so a decision by the people.    
In this case it was even a referendum so the people got to _directly_ decide and you think they didn't?

2. In every democracy there are people that aren't allowed to vote. In modern ones those rules are very reasonable as they mostly include people that are considered too young to make an informed decision. Why would you count those towards the 100%? 

The 100% in a direct vote are _always_ all the people that voted. If you are not allowed to vote, you are not in there and it's good that you aren't, since your decision doesn't matter. 

Also it's your decision if you go and vote or not. If someone decides not to vote, no matrer what they would've voted, they automatically support the majority of the people that did vote, since less people voting means it is easier to gain said majority.

Someone that doesn't vote is as responsible for the outcome of a vote as someone who does.

In the end it means that the outcome of the referendum was the decision of all people that are legally allowed to decide.

That is how democracy works. The majority decision is the decision we are going with. It always has been like that in democracies one way or the other. You can't just say it wasn't a decision now, since you don't agree with the outcome...",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7ksj6n/share_of_europeans_who_have_travelled_at_least/dricx74/,-Antiheld-,1513749628

15,"The issue lies with center parties.

For decades they offered no change, just constant support of status quo. At the same time our societies suffered, our cities got blasted by bombs, inequality has risen and our social systems got overwhelmed by demographic shift.

Those calling for change were on the fringes and almost always labeled as some sort of extremist, in many cases they were.

It came to the point that there was little difference in voting for center-right or center-left, you just got the same thing anyway.

So when someone actually campaigned with promise of change people flocked to them. And center parties had a choice: label them and condemn them, or take over the issue.

The UK politics is an excellent example of this. Labour and Tories became almost indistinguishable during Blair era. Soon after that UKIP begun to rise and Labour soon had it's own shift to left with Corbyn.


The fact of the matter is: As long as politicians ignore will of the people, extremism will rise. Unless politicians actually do what we ask for them, we will vote for anyone promising to do so.

176,"&gt; Could you tell me some stories about what the judiciary has been doing since PIS came to power to provoke this response from the government?

Communist governments ended \ in Poland in 1989 by an agreement of the Round Table. As a result of the agreement, forces such as the police and secret services were verified by independent commissions.
The judiciary was not verified. It was believed that it would clean itself if it was self-ruling.   
Unfortunately it is not working, as it was supposed to. 

2.  What was the relationship between the previous government and the judiciary?   
From the last time: - One of the PO senator said that:  
&gt;The judge who acquitted Sawicki [a politician from their tribe] was [favorable to us](https://wpolityce.pl/polityka/348690-w-sieci-nic-nie-ginie-rulewski-sedzia-ktory-uniewinnil-sawicka-nam-sprzyjal-zeby-z-oszustki-matrymonialnej-i-materialnej-zrobic-bohaterke).  

3. Do you consider the judiciary in general politically biased?   

Absolutly.   As far as I remember the main judge from Constitutional Tribunal was debating with oposition in our Parliament how to get rid of our current government.   

The First President of Supreme Court of Poland took place in anti-government meeting and [she was lying that she was not](http://nczas.com/wiadomosci/gersdorf-klamala-w-zywe-oczy-ze-nie-chodzila-na-demonstracje-w-obronie-sadow-internauci-szukali-dowodow-ze-swieca-znalezli-dziesiatki).  
And many others.   

4. Is there serious corruption (bribes, not political) in the judiciary?  

From the last two years some of them was revealed.   

5. What do you think PIS is trying to accomplish with these reforms?   

Hope they are not trying to took judical system in Poland and we will finaly have independent one.

So the criminal is the one with a gun who checks; works just as easily if you check for an expensive watch.

&gt; Of course it's not impossible. It's just a bad idea: either a situation warrants deadly force or it does not. If it does, center-mass is the most-reliable place to aim. Large target and doesn't move around. If it doesn't, you shouldn't be using a firearm against someone in the first place, because it's too easy to kill someone with it. Take out, say, a leg artery and they'll die in short order.

&gt; But please take into account that the major change is the change of election system.

If you hero Orban describes his view (which is the same as PiS) as based on this [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illiberal_democracy), it is not a buzzword, it is a full fledged definition in politology.

As I said, the Polish governments which filed the application for EU membership pledged to uphold standards of democracy. These standards are being lowered by PiS and is not acceptable to us. I don't agree with the way Turkey and China handle dissent, but since they are not in the EU, I don't have to deal with their shit. 

And I am not even mentioning the parts that complete the illiberal Polish and Hungarian undemocratic puzzle. From making abortion even more restricted than it is in Poland, to private and public media in Hungary being increasingly a voice of Fidesz and nothing else. Exactly what Russia has done.

Putin paints Russia with a veener of democracy by allowing ""free"" elections where he is the less crazy option, just like in Hungary Fidesz is a lamb compared to Jobbik,and the media rant about a Jew trying to control the state via his finances ( very 1930s Germany, Austria, etc).

Surreal differences: the demographics are very different. I have a lot of south Asian / desi colleagues and friends in Vancouver and it just seems normal to me and reflective of the population. Walking down the streets of Seattle there were obviously many more white people and many more black people, and far fewer people of south Asian or East Asian background, and since it *felt* like Vancouver it also felt like a bunch of people were “missing.”

Next, it seemed hard to find breakfast. Seattle seems like a nightlife town and people maybe just roll out of bed, grab coffee, and don’t worry about eating until later in the morning. Don’t know if that’s true or just my random experience but we were right at pike place and finding a decent breakfast anywhere in the several blocks around seemed like a weird quest. Went out into some hipster zone thinking  “Maybe *here* they eat breakfast” but alas... Bread tasted weird but other than that, food was exceptional and not overpriced. 

Downtown buildings seemed kind of boxy, more like putting Calgary’s downtown on Vancouver’s streets. Chihuli gallery was a fantastic surprise and all that worlds fair stuff was great.  The gold rush era history was also news to me, a lot of it shared with Vancouver but they seem to tell the story better in Seattle and there were some awesome engineering projects from the same era to raise downtown that were very interesting. 

Uhhh definitely the single memorable thing was being there the day of another fun massacre, walking around as a tourist and hearing passers-by talk about the unfolding news, and hearing more than one person comment  to their companion “It’s awful isn’t it?....but I sure hope they don’t try to restrict our guns...”)  Heard it once and thought “Ha!

This is where it all stems from. You need to understand Czech history.

&gt;Czech National Revival was a cultural movement, which took part in the Czech lands during the 18th and 19th century. The purpose of this movement was to revive Czech language, culture and national identity.

After 1620 battle of white Mountain and subsequent Germanization

&gt;During the two following centuries the Czech language had been more or less eradicated from state administration, literature, schools, Charles University and among the upper classes. Large numbers of books written in Czech were burned for confessional reasons – for example, Jesuit Antonín Koniáš alone is credited with burning as many as 30,000 Czech language books. **Gradually, the Czech language was reduced to a means of communication between peasants**, who were often illiterate. Therefore, the Revival looked for inspiration among ordinary Czechs in the countryside.

Czech nationalism always had been and continues to revolve around language. Not race or ethnicity or history etc.

Bear in mind that when combined, the V4 is Germany's biggest trading partner, larger than France even. Poland's fiscal and economic policies aligned very closely with those of Germany under Schauble (and way more than France or Southern Europe, for example) with National Bank of Poland being one of the few institutions that remained virtually unchanged throughout the political turmoil that ensued after the 2015 elections. If Poland were to plot a roadmap for adoption of euro in the next few months, Hungary and Czechia would probably reconsider their stance about joining the EZ.

If Poland insists on bringing the judiciary under its wings, it's not a liberal democracy anymore. If they vote a law where they can choose the all the supreme court judges and fire them without a reasonable explanation, the judges will operate under unduly ifluence of the government. 

The US president does choose the supreme court judge, for example, but he cannot choose all of them, as they are for life, and the firing of a given supreme court judge has to motivated in a trial. What PiS proposes is not up to our standards.

And even if your point had any merit (which it doesn't), being a sportsman takes a lot of effort and training.

459,"&gt;You could say, about as useful as currency even! Currency has an inherent value, can you imagine going to the store and trying to trade a lamp from your house for some groceries?

Fiat money is a currency without intrinsic value established as money by government regulation. It has an assigned value only because the government uses its power to enforce the value of a fiat currency.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money)

So, no, still doesn't have any intrinsic value.

&gt;You might say that you already have euros or dollars for that but this is where your opinion diverges from those who invest in cryptos. To them, your government has dollars or euros, you are just along for the ride. The government can print money, inflating it at an unpredictable pace or simply take it away by ordering the local banks around.

Perhaps, but crypto's aren't invulnerable either.

And, sure, many of the advantages may exist for certain combinations of coins, but even more are cancelled out by the flaws  in the coins.

I mean, if I spend a euro, I can be certain that it's still worth a euro when the transaction goes through (which, for bitcoin, is becoming a very long time).

The rights of Hungarians living between the new and the old border of Hungary are not restored, besides they are still a targeted group because anti-Hungarian sentiment is still a prevalent thing.

The Slovak Parliament for example voted the protection of Benes Decree. According to this decree Hungarians of Slovakia are collectively criminal. It is a document that goes against the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, against human rights, democratc values and rationality.
Every party -apart from the Hungarian one- voted in favor of protection of the decree.

The Slovakian Parliament also came up with the Slovak language law, which fines citizens for not using Slovakian language in certain situations. According to the law one is ought to face penalty for singing songs in language other than Slovakian, with the exception that it is the original language of the song.

Minority rights that Slovakia is deemed to guarantee because of EU regulations are not manifested number of times.

Be whatever the reason for why one is salty about Trianon, these issues undermine rational arguments for supporting the status quo.

That's not really true in many circumstances.... Also you must remember that Italy has a very similar mechanism for Italians of the Dalmatian coast. 

&gt;“In our government program, we have complied with a wish of South Tyroleans that was expressed by all parties in South Tyrol and that above all was also expressed by the South Tyrolean provincial government,” Kurz said.

Strache said Italy already has a similar arrangement in place for Italian minorities in Slovenia and Croatia. The Italian Foreign Ministry website lays out conditions under which people who lost their citizenship when some territories became part of Yugoslavia can apply for an Italian passport.

638,"&gt; As I explained, if you want to keep being poor then don't listen to our advice and keep right on doing what you're doing. What you're doing is not sustainable and it will not lead anywhere good in the end, and it also harms us as well as you.

https://eos.org/features/urbanization-air-pollution-now
https://history.libraries.wsu.edu/spring2015/2015/01/18/carbon-emissions-since-the-time-of-the-industrial-revolution/

Economic development did start with pollution in developed countries. It's a fact, to have a good lifestyle, you need to have a major impact on the environment. Developed countries developed their economies based on this. India and China are doing exactly this and are growing fast. The same is not true for Brazil. 

Look at this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_production_from_renewable_sources . Find your country then compare to Brazil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_forest_area. Compare most of Europe with Brazil. 

Look also at population density in the Brazilian Amazon, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/ARCHELLA_E_THERY_Img_05.png/300px-ARCHELLA_E_THERY_Img_05.png.

Also we have some pretty harsh regulations for agrobusiness. What  happens in the amazon is illegal logging and farming. Guess why? Because it's an enormous area and no one lives there.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_of_the_Amazon_rainforest . The rate of deforestation is slowing each year. Still more can be made.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_territory_(Brazil). The indigenous land in Brazil in km2 is bigger than any country in Europe excluding Russia. If they want to live there they can, it's a right on our constitution, if they dont, they can emigrate to urban areas.

The big problem that people outside of Brazil cant undertand is because of geography. They want that we keep 60% of the country without economic development. Pick France and cut 60% of the country and says because some foreigners that dont understand the issue wants that area to be protected, no one can do nothing there. Do you think people will like that?

650,"&gt; When ISIS took over massive swathes of Iraq in 2014, it captured huge amounts of weaponry from the collapsing Iraqi army. Some of the hardware was U.S.-made and the group subsequently attracted headlines for using American M4 and M16 rifles in its propaganda videos as well as humvees in suicide bombings. In 2015, the Iraqi prime minister said that ISIS managed to capture 2,300 humvees when the group took over the city of Mosul. 

&gt; Despite its seemingly impressive haul of western weaponry after its conquests in Iraq, about 90 percent of all weapons and ammunition deployed by ISIS are of Warsaw Pact calibers, mainly originating in China, Russia and Eastern Europe. That was the result of an extensive analysis of 40,000 items of ISIS weaponry recovered in Syria and Iraq, conducted by Conflict Armament Research between 2014 and 2017. 

&gt; The unauthorized retransfer of weapons originally destined for Syrian opposition forces has also turned into a key source of arms for ISIS, particularly anti-tank guided weapons systems. 43.5 percent of all ISIS weapons documented in Syria and Iraq were manufactured by China while Russia only accounts for 9.6 percent. Despite that, Russian weapons still outnumber Chinese weapons in Syria, more than likely due to Russian arms supplies to forces loyal to the Assad regime. Even though ISIS has shown off captured western hardware, American wepons only accounted for 1.8 percent of the total documented.

In Germany it is objectively legal for a 20 year old to have sex with a 14 year old and never a crime. If the older party is older than 20 it is a crime _only_ if the younger party or the legal guardians of the younger party are the ones pressing charges. In the Netherlands up till 2003 the system was similar except 12 was the cutoff and not 14 but now the vague standard of ""the relationship must fall within socio-ethical norms"" is used and apparently sex within the context of an ongoing love relationship between a 13 and 20 year old falls within that.

While the inherent value of a stock is derived from owning some part of a particular company's assets, the inherent value of an ICO coin is typically that you can use it to access some service provided by the company.

Where the issue lies is that since there's a lack of a legal framework and oversight/transparency, there's a lot of ICO-equivalent of pump and dump schemes going on. In most cases this means that the service that was supposed to be provided will not even come into existence and once that's apparent the coins obviously become worthless.

NATO will lose significance in Europe over the coming years as American disinterest in Europe solidifies. The UK will also be less focused on continental European affairs and vice versa. When that state of play occurs, I dont think the UK should expect EU members to be allies diplomatically (nor even in security matters) nor should the EU expect that of the UK.

I wouldnt be surprised if the next Security and Defence review post brexit will take this into account.

The bike in this picture, like many other Dutch city bikes, doesn't even have a derailleur, it doesn't have other gears. 

The whole point of Dutch city bikes is that people don't maintain them, they're build to last in a city environment with as little maintenance as possible. Bikes are parked outside alot even in bad weather conditions. Bikes end up falling over sometimes when parked, or other cyclists being careless when parking their bike next or against it. Also a reason why open chains and cables are generally not a great idea for a city bike.

Front racks are ideal for things like grocery shopping, that's why people prefer a front basket. It's also easier to hold and keep an eye on something in the front rack, instead of back. It really doesn't impair steering that much, some people even hitch rides sitting on the front rack here.

855,"This was the entire fucking purpose of a marriage certificate in a traditionalist society. 

Before everyone became sexually liberated and addicted to that dopamine release, a male would need to approach the father of a woman to prove he had the attributes fit to take on the role of being her husband, and the father of any future children they may have.

The male would commit to a woman and provide to ensure the mother and children went without, and the mother would do her, arguably much more important part, of raising the children at home in their early development years, due to the special emotional maternal bond. 

The father would then, in the later formative years in adolescence, as a leader, would prepare the child for the realities of the world and help them become a functioning adult.

As part of this arrangement, the marriage was consummated and sex meant something more than just some moment of pleasure. It was the special intimate bond between two people. As part of the marriage, the two people involved would engage in consensual sexual intercourse and bring children into the family home.

The contract of marriage meant something and provided the strongest foundation, statistically proven, for children to flourish into respectful adults due to having both the mother and father in their lives.

Now, of course, marital rape happens and there are also arranged marriages, but by the majority, most marriages were based on the arrangement outlined above.

Now we have a society whereby:

1. Marriage is in decline
2. Single parenthoodhood is on the rise
3. The divorce rate is skyrocketing
4. Sex means absolutely nothing - just another addiction like drugs or alcohol
5. Women are committing suicide in their early 30s due to not having children or being married
6. Men are going their own way because things like divorce laws screw them over more often than not
7. Both men and women are sleeping around and STD's are on the rise including new strains

No, they can not survive unless they descend under the human condition.

Homelessness in German can mean either ""Wohnungslosigkeit"" (not owning or renting a place to live in) or ""Obdachlosigkeit"" (living on the streets without a roof over your head). The ""hundreds of thousands"" refers to the former definition; nobody seems to have exact numbers for how many people literally have no roof over their heads.

Homelessness in the broader sense includes living in a shelter (including, for example, a women's shelter after domestic violence incidents, or a refugee shelter for recently arrived asylum seekers), temporary social housing, living with friends or relatives (who can theoretically throw you out at a moment's notice), and staying in a cheap hostel.

Common reasons, according to the BAGW [1] include unemployment, divorce, domestic violence, debt, imprisonment, moving to a different city, moving out of your parents' home.

963,"It should be noted that this might be a nomenclature thing by the way.

Like in the Dutch system a threat of an unlawful act or violence is required to call it ""rape"" but even without that it is often still illegal but the crime of ""ontucht"" is used then.

So if you restrain someone some-how who says ""no"" or even do it when someone says ""No"" that's rape but for instance doing someone to someone completely uninvited but stopping when that person says ""no"" may be ontucht and whether it is ontucht or not is a grey crime by design. Ontucht are sexual acts when ""a reasonable person would assume that the other is not appreciative"" which is pretty vague obviously and leaves room for the idea that you have more social licence to do things with people you have an established prior relationship with than total strangers of course.

I think recently in some US state forced anal penetration with any object was reclassified from ""first grade sexual assault"" to ""rape"" which up till that point was only for vaginal penetration but the sticker is that the punishment for both is the same so it's purely a semantics thing with no actual practical implications.",,/r/europe/comments/7ksjvg/swedish_pm_backs_new_law_meaning_sex_without/drgupar/,my_honour_demands_it,1513684714
964,"&gt; But in both cases, it was a decision between the Centrist, moderate solution (staying in EU, Hillary Clinton) and the extreme solution (Brexit supported by both extreme left and right and Trump supported by the extreme right). It was the decision between ""Continue as it is"" and ""Change/Uncertainty"".

On a factual level, yes, but in terms of rhetoric (which is what people are ultimately going to base their decision on in most cases imo) it was everything but. Neither the Clinton camp nor the Remain camp ran a particularly moderate campaign that made it a point to reject extremist viewpoints.

&gt; One cause of that drift is the rise of what is called neo-liberal policy, which was embraced by the big Conservative parties in the 80s and the Social Democrats in the 90s. This dictates that states had to lower taxes for the rich and companies, deregulate markets and privatize state-run companies.

This is certainly a factor, but I would point out that it's also a necessity in a globalized economy. We can't just be consumer markets but also have to be attractive for production as well as investment in general, which requires markets that are open enough to at least kind of compete. I believe a big part of being a successful centrist candidate is explaining these sort of apparent necessities to the electorate at large.

&gt; This is because these people were told that there is no money and also no solidarity anymore. If you tell people that there is no solidarity, why should they take part in the misery of a refugee? Why should they be sympathetic?

I agree. This is why I think Macron's approach to the refugee crisis is very reasonable. People respond well enough to pragmatism, but you can't sell them on idealism or solidarity if they can't expect the same in return from their government.

&gt; Neoliberalism and the Social Democrats also meant that the Left had to differentiate itself from the right in a different way - like with the cultural shift you mentioned.

Agreed. The Left certainly has an identity crisis right now as they're becoming more and more moderate on economic issues and can't really distinguish themselves from conservatives anymore.

&gt; I doubt that can happen, unless there are serious attempts to fix the problems we have. Lets look into the near future: Automation will kill millions of jobs, which won´t be replaced by new jobs in a nearly high enough number. If the Political elites have no answer to that other than ""its inevitable / sorry, there is no money for you and no job"" - do you really think this is going to work?

I don't, though I don't think automation will lend itself to the same level of polerization. But I do think that the current wave of extremism will pass before automation becomes enough of an issue to cause a new one, leaving room for political reallignment in the interim. Automation means that we will have to change the way we think, but we won't be successful in this endeavor if extremists have fucked up our countries before we even get to that point.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7klu5c/france_macrons_party_lrem_leads_in_european/drgupb6/,iTomes,1513684715

What the current euroskepticism is about is an anti-establishment sentiment that is caused by long existing, structural problems in the Italian economy and democracy.  
The EU falls into this discourse because of the ""diktats"" coming from Bruxelles at the times of the world economic crisis, when the Italian's debt weighted the most on us.  
The debt has its cause only in Italy, but the EU attitude of casting Southern Europe as a guilty party to be chastised was not received well, and was a big part in the rise of the M5S, the party that will probably get the most votes in the next round of elections.  

The immigration crisis was another sour point, but for a different reason: the EU was incapable of giving any help, with the Eastern Bloc outright refusing to take in any immigrants.

note that proper laws would prevent companies from firing your just because you got old(that'd be a form of discrimination). it's more about allowing you to fire people with a proper cause by no direct fault of the employee, which i understand is a tricky area but somewhat needed to maintain innovation and allow companies to stay healthy even if there isn't constant growth. it obviosuly shouldnt be american style regulations where you can just decide to fire someone at any moment just because they looked at you wrong, but as long as the money is an adequate compensation for having to look for a new job and everything there's nothing inherently wrong with it. you could even make it scale with how long you worked somewhere, making it a lot more expensive to get rid of the guy that has been working his ass off for you the last 30 years than to fire the new 25year old who only worked here a couple months.",,/r/europe/comments/7kl7u2/nuclear_renewables_to_help_french_co2_reduction/drgs1rp/,zelatorn,1513677922

This is similar to the situation in Crimea, where since Ukrainian independence population took all possible legal means to obtain more autonomy, while central authorities kept ignoring those demands and instead eroded any and all possibilities to obtain greater self-rule.

&gt;Rami Elyakim, an Israeli who lost his wife of 40 years, Dalia, and who was badly injured himself, said he had been appalled to learn of the catalogue of errors made leading up to the attack.

So instead of a currency controlled by people who are accountable to the citizens, it's controlled by people who are only accountable to their own interests.

The technology behind BitCoin and especially behind Etherum is great and might bring new possibilities in the future, but not with those controlled by miners.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party

&gt;The Boston Tea Party was a political protest by the Sons of Liberty in Boston, Massachusetts, on December 16, 1773. The demonstrators, some disguised as Native Americans, in defiance of the Tea Act of May 10, 1773, destroyed an entire shipment of tea sent by the East India Company. They boarded the ships and threw the chests of tea into Boston Harbor. The British government responded harshly and the episode escalated into the American Revolution. The Tea Party became an iconic event of American history, and since then other political protests such as the Tea Party movement have referred to themselves as historical successors to the Boston protest of 1773.

-

&gt;The Boston Tea Party was a significant event in the growth of the American Revolution. Parliament responded in 1774 with the Coercive Acts, or Intolerable Acts, which, among other provisions, ended local self-government in Massachusetts and closed Boston's commerce. Colonists up and down the Thirteen Colonies in turn responded to the Coercive Acts with additional acts of protest, and by convening the First Continental Congress, which petitioned the British monarch for repeal of the acts and coordinated colonial resistance to them. The crisis escalated, and the American Revolutionary War began near Boston in 1775.

-

&gt;John Adams and many other Americans considered tea drinking to be unpatriotic following the Boston Tea Party. Tea drinking declined during and after the Revolution, resulting in a shift to coffee as the preferred hot drink.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee

&gt;Coffee consumption declined in England, giving way to tea during the 18th century. The latter beverage was simpler to make, and had become cheaper with the British conquest of India and the tea industry there.

-

&gt;Rapid growth in coffee production in South America during the second half of the 19th century was matched by growth in consumption in developed countries, though nowhere has this growth been as pronounced as in the United States, where high rate of population growth was compounded by doubling of per capita consumption between 1860 and 1920. Though the United States was not the heaviest coffee-drinking nation at the time (Nordic countries, Belgium, and Netherlands all had comparable or higher levels of per capita consumption), due to its sheer size, it was already the largest consumer of coffee in the world by 1860, and, by 1920, around half of all coffee produced worldwide was consumed in the US.

[The Slow Death of The Most British Thing There Is](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/04/why-the-british-are-drinking-coffee-instead-of-tea/?utm_term=.b6d1fdfd06f7):

&gt;Between the mid-1970s and the 1980s, tea consumption fell by 20 percent in the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, the country's taste for coffee was blossoming, so much so, in fact, that in 1986 coffee sales in the U.K. outpaced tea sales for the first time in history.
&gt;
&gt;The generational sipping gap was both real and really pronounced. But fast-forward to today and you see that the trend was also only just beginning.
&gt;
&gt;The years have transformed what originally seemed like a decade-long quirk into a tectonic cultural shift that now spans nearly half a century. And there is no end to the collective tea abandonment in sight.
&gt;
&gt;Just last year, volume sales of standard black tea bags fell by 2 percent in the United Kingdom, according to data from market research firm Euromonitor. Sales of coffee pods — the fastest-growing sector of the coffee market — rose by 33 percent. In each of the coming five years, Euromonitor expects overall coffee sales to grow and overall tea sales to fall.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7kpp3h/change_in_european_coffee_consumption_kg_per/drgp5de/,vokegaf,1513670650

1300,"Competition and economics. Remember that the difficulty for the math involved scales with the hash rate, not users/transactions. It's not that Bitcoin requires this many miners, this many miners are involved because Bitcoin is profitable.

The miners themselves are constantly seeking to lower their electricity usage to increase profit, which means relocating to where electricity is cheapest, as well as utilizing ever more efficient ASICs.

It gets harder and harder to compete over time, so you will see greater consolidation. For now, greater electricity consumption is following Bitcoin's surge in price as miners seek to get their cut, but the price won't keep going up forever.

At some point it will eventually stabilize, and then market reality kicks in and the returns won't be the same.

This is similar to how a new market for something like PCs or smartphones is created: great profits are realized at first, then eventually it finishes when the process becomes commoditized and margin drops to nothing, unless you have a special monopoly/edge like Apple does with their software.

Miners will start to go bankrupt trying to keep up with the competition as the price holds steady while investment costs rise, and you end up with a few very efficient miners taking over.

It's already pointless to mine on your CPU or GPU, as you'll just be wasting money. And it's why all mining has already moved to places like China where electricity costs are low. Mining on this scale is extremely expensive and not easy to get into.

All of this is moot anyway as more efficient ways to ensure integrity are found and implemented, I just don't want people thinking that it's a permanent problem even if nothing changes in the protocol.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7kkczo/eu_agrees_clampdown_on_bitcoin_platforms_to/drgfx7j/,ShiasHoboBeard,1513655629

I don't think I did.  You centrists are all about style and process.  You could give a shit how horrid a politician's agenda is, as long as he pays fealty to the 'proper way' of acting etc. and as long as he spouts off the right empty platitudes.  

&gt;Even if you disagree with Macron program

I do.

&gt; fact is that he is honest about it, he moves towards it at a steady pace

The fact that he wants to eviscerate the labour code of France and carry out more failed neoliberals concerns me more than *how* he goes about it.

&gt;and he does so in a strong ""presidential way"" that inspire strength and confidence

See.

&gt;hen you're surrounded by chaos and dim witted leader showing so much incompetence, there is value in being led by a competent man, even if you disagree with his direction.

Were you born yesterday?  There's a reason for chaos all around.  Much of it has to do with the 40 odd years of failed neoliberal wealth redistribution to the rich and the increasingly shitty life/job/social prospects of the majority.  So no, someone wishing to carry on with more shitty neoliberal capitalism is not something to be happy about or support.

&gt;I mean, I'm sure the remainers in UK would very much prefer to have someone competent lead their negotiations for brexit right now

Maybe years of Thatcherism followed by third way Blairism has something to do with the mess the UK is in right now?  When you destroy your social welfare state, schools, hospitals and jobs while spending hundreds of billions to bailout criminal bankers and the City, shit will probably go south real fucking quick.

&gt;all the liberals would probably prefer a smart republican to what they have now. 

There are smart Republicans. Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell aren't dummies.  Its their agenda and vision for society that makes Republicans vile pieces of shit, not their style.

My impression is that Latin Americans (particularly Mexicans) are divided in the issue: there are those who see the country as a descendant of Spain and those who see themselves as descendants of the natives who were ruthlessly exploited by the Spaniards. In my opinion, the truth is somewhere in the middle. Genetically it seems that Mexico is very mixed, with the North being slightly more European than indigenous, and the South being substantially more indigenous than European.

Moreover, each Latin American country is very different. Mexico and the Central American republics are, in my opinion, mainly indigenous.

As long as bitcoin is unchanged, the amount of processing power dedicated to mining will be tied to the reward of mining a block (transaction fee plus new bitcoin mined). Unless something on the code is agreed and change, we will have one scenario where the block size will be the same as today (limiting the number of transactions) and the extra reward for mining will be zero. At that moment, several things can happen:

- There is a massive downscale on the mining efforts, making bitcoin less secure that it is today.

- The transactions fees creep up to levels where it is no longer viable as a currency, just an investment security (and we are basically there)

- The size of the block is radically increased, to allow for more transactions, so transaction fees can be lower. However, at that moment creating a fresh currency may be a better option. If bitcoing (or a successor fork) becomes an actual serious currency, society as a whole is massively rewarding people that got into the market soon. An many people with money may not want that.

She's by far the most popular politician in the country, respected across the political spectrum. It's not because she's a young, good-looking woman, but mainly because she's very intelligent, experienced, and a strong leader. In any coalition including her party, she would almost automatically be the prime minister of choice.  
  
By forming a coalition with parties which are normally her party's political opponents, she made a tough choice as a leader. Many on the left wing, both in her party and in others, were very vocally opposed to that choice. But it was arguably a great move because it won over most moderate voters. The new government has a 78% approval rating in a recent poll, which I'm fairly sure is the highest any government has started with since 2008.  
  
So all in all, it's probably the strongest government that could have been formed in the fractured political environment of 2017. Many hope it will bring stability and reconciliation.

Yeah, there is definitely more nationalism in the UK. I think that's one of the ways in which Canada is better. You have more immigration than we do and yet you've handled it a lot better. I think that's down to history.

A reasonable amount of blocks will be rewarded to miners for the foreseeable future, 12.5 every 10 minutes ATM at $19,000 a coin + about 3 BTC in transaction fees per block. The reward for mining will have in summer 2020, if by then each coin costs 40K it'll be ok (and not the 1,000,000 that some predict) the network will be the same as now after halving (discounting every other factor).  
  
  
The hope is that by some time in the future the current flaws are figured out.  
  
  
1. That is true, it can lead to a sudden increase in centralization and loss in security.
2. Also true and I'd consider that the death of Bitcoin, at least for me. Maybe It'll have a valid use then still, but other coins will do that better by then + much more.
3. Increasing the blocksize will increase transaction throughput linearly. Its not a longterm solution. Going from 1 MB to 2 MB has security implications regarding centralization.

1445,"&gt;Isabella in particular was famously opposed to slave trade

My understanding is that the Spanish crown didn't want the natives to be mistreated either; in fact, I read somewhere that legally speaking the natives were on the same level as children to be protected by the colonial authorities.  However, there were still plenty of abuses and a strictly enforced caste system that had the ""peninsulares"" on top and everyone else below them.

Even so by the time of the war of independence a significant portion of the ""Royalist"" army fighting for Spain was not European.  There were even native units fighting against the rebels, so it's really a complex issue.  

I don't know why there is a statue of Isabella in front of the OAS building (which is located in Washington, DC).  I live about two hours from there so maybe I will go and see if I can find out.  However, statues not only tell us about the person being honored but about the people who decided to put them there in the first place.

In the Dominican Republic there is a statue of Christopher Columbus in the main plaza of the colonial city and a lot of people today find that odd given how cruel he was as governor of that island during the early colonial period. But that statue in question was put there late in the 19th century;  I really doubt that Dominicans would honor him with a statue today if there wasn't one already.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7knz44/isabella_i_the_catholic_queen_of_castille_of/drgbge7/,ujorge,1513650511

Spain on the other hand saw its colonies as a place to extract resources and imposed a [Caste system] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casta) that put those born in Spain on top of everyone else.  You could have two brothers from Spanish parents and if one was born in Spain and the other in America, the European one had more rights than his brother.

http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/12/turnout_exceeds_expectations_i.html

&gt;Well Dems had no chance really? They were losing left and right. They had to try everything in their arsenal and go even for lost causes. 

No, if the Dems thought they were at a disadvantage, they would have trouble finding candidates to run in Republican districts and states.

Instead, they would focus on keeping the seats they have and going after vulnerable Republicans who represent Democratic-leaning parts of the country.

Strong Democratic candidates are running in Republican parts of the country because they sense weakness in the GOP.

Roy Moore is an unusual case because of his scandals, but in 2018 Dems will also field candidates in almost every congressional race in Texas, for example.

&gt;I have the impression it'll happen like 2008. Dems will win for 2 years in 2020 and then it's back to a House that is R.

All House districts will be redrawn in 2021.  Each state gets to decide the configuration its House districts, so partisan control of state governments, whether complete or partial, defines what the districts look like.  A party that fully controls a state tends to gerrymander its House districts.

If the Dems have wave elections in 2018, 2019 (not many elections, but some), and 2020, they will take control of many states, either in whole or in part.  

At the minimum, this will lead to the undoing of the GOP's gerrymandering that has allowed them to control the House.

At the maximum, it will lead to the Dems gerrymandering the GOP out of controlling the House for at least the next decade.

&gt;We can also say that if Moore wasn't so flawed, in his harassement of women, he wouldn't have lost. 

Yeah, I'm not disagreeing with you.  There's a list of things that happened that were necessary for Doug Jones to win.  Moore's weakness as a candidate is one of those things.  A high Dem turnout is another.

My point is that while Moore's scandals were a unique factor, heightened Democratic turnout and Dems running strong candidates are nationwide trends.

One could illustrate those trends with Virginia's November elections or the numerous special elections that took place earlier this year (both federal, state, and local), and IMO, that would be better for an in-depth analysis, since most elections don't have a Roy Moore.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7khlmi/netherlands_wilderss_farright_pvv_enf_on_lowest/drg3ryd/,executivemonkey,1513641359

Julio Borges has also been [attacked](https://medium.com/vz-dispatch/julio-borges-new-president-of-venezuelas-national-assembly-e602cce18d12) because of his opposition views and his responses to the current human rights violations 

&gt;*Borges has been one of the most outspoken critics of the policies of Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro, and as a result the frequent target of verbal and physical attacks. In April 2013, members of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PDVSA) assaulted Borges in the National Assembly after he and other lawmakers protested a ban on opposition members speaking within the chamber of the legislative body. In June 2016, Borges was also attacked by government mobs outside the National Assembly, suffering multiple fractures that required emergency operations.*

1538,"What's my take on why Germany (and the EU: this is hardly just Germany) doing?  Why can't you get in as easily as some guy from Afghanistan?

I'd call it more an artifact of the fact that you aren't gonna get a consensus from the general public on straightforward immigration-sans-welfare to immigrants.  If you could get that approved in Germany, government would have a lot more flexibility to choose ""ideal"" immigrants.

Publics do not like mass immigration, so they wil will oppose it.  The Brits would oppose even, say, twenty million Yanks descending on them.

Unfortunately, Germany needs some form of large-scale immigration, if she is not going to have a ton of babies, despite the fact that her public will oppose it, same as other EU members.  So top of her concerns is dealing with her demographic issues.

Germany doesn't dislike you.  Germany just has political handcuffs.  She has to find a legal route to get very large amounts of people in.

The Refugee Convention is (a) reasonably politically-acceptable to the general public, (b) is deeply-baked into EU law where it is very hard for anyone opposed to mass immigration to change: you'd need a majority in every EU member's legislature to do so, which will not happen if every bureaucracy knows that the EU needs people, (c) can be used to pass a very wide range of people around the world in while limiting the executive and legislature (the bits directly under public control) from political exposure to public upset.

It's a tool to do something that is necessary for the country but extremely unpopular.

The Refugee Convention, however, is only useful for letting people into the country if they are threatened where they are, or can claim to be.  In practice, if you wanted to illegally get into Germany via this route (go to Libya, get in a raft, get picked up by the Italian coast guard, claim that you're an oppressed Syrian, vanish once in Europe, work illegally), you could probably get in on the terms that people are getting in on.  Pretty crummy terms, though.  Maybe get refugee status from a really screwed-up country.

Germany cares about that because it's the only way that she's gonna get millions more people out of thin air.

You are not going to personally solve Germany's demographic problems.  But why doesn't Germany at least *try* for some Australians?  I dunno.  I can speculate.  If Germany tries pulling millions of people from Australia:

* Her public probably wouldn't like it, though they might like it more than people from the Middle East.

* I don't think that she has the draw to do so.  Australia is wealthier, and it's hard to swim upstream against that current.

* Countries with subsidized social services don't want people ""shopping"" them for the best deal — education here, childcare here, low taxes here, old age services here.  If you legally-immigrated, you would represent something of a risk.  So they are gonna tend to restrict people from just walking in.  I don't think that any welfare state just lets people in without restriction.  They want you to tend to be putting more into the system than you will take out..

* The fact that you have German blood might go over well with the general public, which is gonna be at least a bit tribal everywhere.  But I'd guess that's gonna carry a lot less water with the people planning the German economy, who are probably reasonably confident that eventually people will eventually work out and get along.

* The multiple citizenship thing also might be Germany.  [Wikipedia says that Australia — like us in the States — is reasonably comfortable with multiple citizenships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_citizenship).  Not all countries in the world are like this, and Germany is a lot-less enthusiastic about multiple citizenships.  Germany's also had an extremely-difficult political situation on here recently involving multiple citizenships.  Turks were permitted to immigrate.  Turkey doesn't let Turks freely renounce citizenship, and so there is a large multiple-citizenship group in Germany which has grated somewhat.  Recently, the President of Turkey has been loudly exhorting this group to vote in particular ways, and Germany has tried to affect their votes in Turkish elections.  Combine this with an effort to strip citizenship from dual citizens who fought with ISIS and the idea that multiple citizenships are a problem is something that, as far as I can tell, has a lot of legislative and popular currency right now in Europe.  So I doubt that this will change any time soon.

If you've got an in-demand skillset and are willing to jump some annoying barriers, I'd guess that you probably can get a German work visa of some sort if you feel strongly about moving your life to Germany and follow that path to citizenship.  I'm not a great person to ask about the best route for that.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7kjxxd/europes_migrants_are_here_to_stay/drg4bij/,vokegaf,1513642014

1544,"Thanks for your response!

The problem is that Google has a near monopoly of the search market. If it gives it's own shopping-comparison results before everyone else's, then the competition in the shopping-comparison market will have a really hard time getting started/keep attracting customers. So it gives Google an advantage in that market as well. If they are allowed to do that in one market, than there may be a big chance of them doing it in other markets as well. This gives them an (in European view unfair) advantage in new markets, because they can kill newcomers while boosting their own service, just by showing their results first on the searchpage.

In my view, letting Google (or anyone else for that matter) do this wouldn't be good, as it would give large companies power in markets where they have not yet proven themselfs. I'm also convinced that, because we don't let large companies do this, there is more competition in different markets, which makes the prices go down and the quality go up, as expensive or bad products will not be bought as much as cheaper and well made products.

I'm interested in what you think about this, and also on why you think that. May I ask you for that?

I do agree with your assessment that democracy requires discourse and choices to function well over time, but I don't share your fear that the far right will just take over anyway the longer the centrists remain a political constant. To me the far right comes across as more of a reaction to a strong influx of Middle Eastern immigration as well as a cultural shift in regards to immigration among the left. I think both of these are ultimately going to pass which will also take the wind out of the sails of the far right.

The problem is that the people don't see the rightwing as a threat to the welfare state. And afterall, the rightwing also has the problem of having no influence on the economy. But that is way less problematic to their message.

&gt; Social democrats are less than 4 percentage points from being the largest group in the european parliament 

Only because many of the traditional centre-right parties are also doing bad. Christian democracy, which was in the past the basis for the EPP, is also a dying ideology. 

Don't let those results fool you. With the exception of Labour and the PS in Portugal every single social democratic party in Europe either scored a record low the last elections or are polling to do son in the next election. Maybe [this graph] (https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20160402_FBC847.png) shows it more clearly.

The argument doesn't make sense. You hit the nail later on in the head though by saying Russia has already once sent its people by the million to die - do you honestly think they wouldn't do that again? 

Also, you claim that Europe has 3,000 fighter jets is a wild exaggeration - there are roughly 2,000 fighters with a varying amount of quality in there, a quarter of that could be considered 4th/5th generation in ability. The Russians are behind in that regard with around 250 of that calibre but they have excellent anti air defence systems designed to take on American technology. Its really not a simple maths game of more fighters = more air superiority. It never has been - the Battle of Britain showed the world that. 

Look I'm not trying to suggest that the Russians are coming and they'd be crazy Ivan enough to actually do it, but if they were to do it they'd be a lot more effective than people seem to think. Its actually not that Europe isn't co-ordinated, it has NATO to sort things out until the Yanks show up, its just not strong enough collectively nor really all that ready. We thought we were ready Hitler turned on France yet they drove around the Maginot Line - even when the Wehrmacht had bloody horses pulling their supplies along the line. You can't underestimate a nation that is build for war and have that warlike mentality - you seem to think the grandmothers will be upset well glorious nation of Russia needs brave sons to die for the Motherland (be it as insane as it sounds). Russia isn't suddenly going to go in flames because the few troops that were garrisoned in the regional citadel have moved to a new tile and caused an imbalance in the game mechanics.

You might want to tone down your comments next time before you post them, because they come off as abrasive and do not encourage further discussion. Back on subject, however, I have based my comment on [eurostat data](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7192292/1-26022016-AP-EN.pdf/602b34e8-abba-439e-b555-4c3cb1dbbe6e), excluding Bucharest-Ilfov NUTS 2 metropolitan area (it's not even a proper region, if you look at how its demarcated), which skews the picture by inflating the numbers -- most country-wide businesses tend to have their registered offices in capitals. For the starkest example, see the NUTS 2 Parisian Region, which stands for close to 1/3 of the country's GDP, while accounting for 1.88% of its area (Bucharest-Ilfov is actually even less at 0.76% or 1811 km2 out of 238,397 km2).

1581,"&gt; The economy remains sustainable if a little less goes to people who are already unimaginably rich and a bit more goes towards workers, thus facilitating small businesses having also a strong basis for starting with people being able to accrue some money from their activities as workers rather than just surviving.

That depends on the economy. Looking at the French example it was seemingly necessary to move back a bit of worker's rights as their economy was at risk of stagnation.

&gt; So this isn't working, what we have tried in the past hasn't worked. Maybe it's time for something new?

Except there are examples of it working. Why play guinea pig for something new (not that there's anything readily available right now from what I can tell) that will probably fail instead of doing a better job of implementing measures that have found success globally.

&gt; Which countries have been experiencing wage growth and reduced inequality. In my mind these are the only metrics worth evaluating, after 5 years of my economy growing and people beign worse off for it.

That's a questionable way of looking at it when considering the state of many countries across the globe. Being able to actually live and not have your country fall into shambles around you seems much more important to me.

&gt; Remember we live in a society where people are seriously in contention for being elected by proposing radical policies like at-will employment. You keep talking like we are living in a social-democracy and should maybe try more capitalism. This isn't the reality. Social-democracy has been derided as radical, juvenile and laughable for at least two decades.

To create some bitcoins you need to really work for it and the supply will be steady, predictable and finite. With the EUR it is up to the whims of whoever has their proverbial finger on the proverbial printing press.  
  
That is a feature of Bitcoin. You can not just create them willy-nilly. No matter the amount of computing behind the network, Bitcoins will be mined to a finite number in a predictable supply curve over the next 140 years as long as there is an operational Bitcoin mining network.  
  
Bitcoin is making money, moving money from the pockets of people to the pockets of other people, much like the rest of the economy. Whether that is making Ferraris, producing a TV show, making bread, making fancy bread, building and renting apartments.  
  
Bitcoin is shifting some of the economic activity. It will eventually hit a wall where rising energy prices, the price of bitcoin and bitcoin transfer fees will not allow the bitcoin network to grow in energy usage and it'll have to grow through efficiency.

1660,"Green party voter here for whom the balance tips slightly towards shutting down nuclear power. My reasons are:

* There is a lot of cool more modern designs you regularly hear about (producing less radioactive waste/waste that will be harmless faster/be safer), but to actually move those designs from the lab to real life requires time and money. If we build new plants, without investing in more research, they'll be of the existing types. Which means, producing non-negligible amounts of waste we'll have to worry about for quite a long term.
* Long-term storage/disposal of the nuclear waste is often an afterthought. That's in my opinion not acceptable, especially if that means that the government will just have to pay for it 'later', effectively subsidizing nuclear power over alternatives.
* I want the world to actually switch to renewable energy. Switching to nuclear power means a large short term gain. (Making a country do 'relatively well'.) That might mean they won't invest in other solutions, at least until the rest of the world made a similar progress. I'd prefer if countries keep innovating, as everyone profits from that in the end.

I guess I'd not actually mind nuclear power if we got serious about investing in research + long term waste disposal, but I consider that unlikely in the current political climate.

](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/6418456/Labour-wanted-mass-immigration-to-make-UK-more-multicultural-says-former-adviser.html)

&gt;Labour threw open Britain's borders to mass immigration to help socially engineer a ""truly multicultural"" country, a former Government adviser has revealed.

&gt;The huge increases in migrants over the last decade were partly due to a politically motivated attempt by ministers to radically change the country and ""rub the Right's nose in diversity"", according to Andrew Neather, a former adviser to Tony Blair, Jack Straw and David Blunkett.

&gt;He said Labour's relaxation of controls was a deliberate plan to ""open up the UK to mass migration"" but that ministers were nervous and reluctant to discuss such a move publicly for fear it would alienate its ""core working class vote"".

&gt;As a result, the public argument for immigration concentrated instead on the economic benefits and need for more migrants.
Critics said the revelations showed a ""conspiracy"" within Government to impose mass immigration for ""cynical"" political reasons.

&gt;...

I still don't see the logic: If serfdom were to be reintroduced and all Bangladesh and Sub-Saharan Africa were to be transplanted into Europe, there would be little to no improvement in the aggregate demand as slaves aren't very good customers.

No, productivity should be targeted so that unemployment decreases and wages increase in order to improve demand. Surely the massive intra-euro area misalignments have to be addressed first by carrying out an orderly dissolution of the single currency.

&gt;sheer numbers the EU is talking about.

Can we let the market do their job? If workers are needed, unemployment and underemployment decrease while wages rise. Are we still at econ101?

&gt;The US tends to pull low-skill workers via illegal immigration. So I know that it's viable.

&gt;Immigration is a threat to the country,

No, some forms or quantities *might* be. Some are only a threat to some idealized version of the country, or to the average skintone of it, which isn't very important. There's a discussion to be had about which numbers are problematic, which ones are too problematic, and when 

&gt;Immigration is a threat to the country, The left-wing support it because they wish to transform society and create a global mono-culture 

Which is generally speaking that they want to see their local European leftwing values gain widespread acceptance. Then again, it's not that level of strategy: it's simply a local application of their universalist values, not a conspiracy.

&gt;and the Right-wing(bourgeois) want immigration to lower wages and break unions as well as crush the welfare state. 

Which is not entirely consistent with a general dislike of hiring immigrants. Generally they do indeed want to abolish the welfare state, and even without that indirect pressure they don't really care for whom they are abolishing it. They would make use of migration-related conflicts even without a plan to use it as such.

1971,"Speaking as an American activist that works in some of the same circles, there's multiple legal land mines that are currently impacting people around the world.

1. There is little to no legal standing for companies to spend appropriate amounts of resources protecting consumer data. This leads to a very lackadaisical approach to security because the companies go largely unpunished for data breaches due to negligence.

2. There are little to no protections regarding the transfer-ability of customer data when companies merge or are acquired by other companies. A good recent example is Humble Bundle. Generally they were a privacy respecting organization that represented good causes. They retained some customer data but were responsible with it and did not sell this data to other organizations.

HumbleBundle was recently acquired by J2 Capital, and now all of that customer information will be diced up, combed through with analytics, and sold off. Most nations do not have laws that govern these types of lateral changes in policy that impact customers who never agreed to the new terms on privacy and data sharing.

3. The knowledge barrier. Most people do not know in what way their data is being analyzed, how they are being tracked online, or to whom this data is sold to. This is because all of this information is buried in 40+ page license agreements that no reasonable person can read. Nations do not have privacy regulations that allow for different levels of certification for how user data is handled by various companies. This would allow users to be able to quickly review privacy policies by looking at a badge/grade/whatever and having the knowledge of how their data is being used.

This framework would also allow from punishment for violations of the clearly defined standards. If a company has promised to never sell your information, and then does so, that is a clear legal violation that is easily enforced.",,/r/europe/comments/7kklk6/i_am_max_schrems_a_privacy_activist_and_founder/drfctjd/,Youknowimtheman,1513612969

2014,"&gt; Switzerland has probably the most successful political system on the planet. One of the major reason why the country is so rich and successful is its political system.

And their defensive location, and their policy of making themselves useful to whomever held the power in Europe at that time by mercenaries, weapons, or money storage, and a little bit of luck making sure they weren't conquered for half a millenium or longer.

&gt; I mean the country has four official languages and around 30% of the population wasn't born in Switzerland. Most other countries would fall apart. Federalism, a technocratic government while giving the people the right to vote and laws is literally the best system I can think of. Honestly, the EU would much better if they just used the Swiss system instead of their centralist and undemocratic concept they are using now.

Remember that wages are vastly better in Europe than in many places from where people come.

In Bangladesh, I imagine that some work illegally.  But let us imagine that nobody does.  Minimum wage in Bangladesh is about 25 pounds per month.  The UK minimum wage is age-based, but for an adult, one makes about that every four hours of work.  That's ten times higher.

2255,"Okay, I'll explain why I think Baudet is so terrible on his opinion about women. Even though it was about characters in his novel, he as an author made a lot of claims about 'what women like' and what women are like, and presented them as fact. Most of those claims were incredibly insulting. He perpetuated the kind of ""pick up artist"" tricks were you basically ignore any boundaries a women sets in the kind of 'if she says no you just have to push harder' way. He claims that that's what women *actually want* when they tell you no. A lot of his claims just come very close to promoting rape or at the very least ignoring what women tell you. I know those 'pick-up artist' or 'art of seduction' ideas can be interpreted as just innocent ways of dealing with flirting but they really come across as incredibly unfriendly to women and reduce all women to some kind of stereotype that acts only in predetermined ways. So okay I understand there might be a difference in interpretation of baudet's ideas here, but read this article which also has my take on it a bit more: [it also has some exerpts from the book](https://www.vn.nl/je-hoeft-zijn-roman-niet-te-lezen-om-te-weten-wat-kamerlid-thierry-baudet-van-vrouwen-vindt/)

2334,"I fully agree with you.

The issue is that immigrating (Note: I *don't* mean entering with the word immigrating. I mean entering with intention to stay) to Europe legally is very hard. Immigrating to Europe illegally and then eventually being legalised **seems** easier to many.

Therefore, there is a perception held by potential imigrants that they only have to somehow get in and eventually it'll work out and they'll get some kind of subsidy. This was a huge deal with the refugee crisis, where some believed they'd get a house, car and in some cases even a wife. The same happens with subsaharan immigration into Spain and Italy: in the countries of origin the news about deaths in the Mediterranean are just not believed: people are convinced that this is just propaganda. In their minds, people that actually die during the journey are just people that moved on to a better country and never minded to call back.

What we need to understand is that as a result of demanding higher restrictions to immigrations our politicians have made legal immigration incredibly difficult. Therefore, illegal immigration seems like a more attractive idea for many with a mind conditioned to the third world; where doing something illegal (not crime!) is not such a big deal; especially when it comes to significantly improving their lives.

Actually, we don't even need to change the facts (though often changing the real conditions can change the perception of these conditions) on public benefits, access to our welfare states etc. Maybe all we need is a very smart PR campaign in the countries of origin to change perceptions; but maybe we should change our laws AND do a PR campaign.

I am in favour of making legal immigration of skilled workers easier, working on changing perceptions of illegal immigration AND improving the conditions in the countries of origin. We therefore must also analyse how our foreign and domestic policies impact the countries of origin direct ans indirectly, while providing direct help.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/7kfuky/geert_wilders_calls_for_trumpstyle_muslim_travel/drexnqg/,reaqtion,1513584398

They also help North Koreans learn about how everything words under capitalism, as well as teaching them the Southern dialect of Korean and key terms (""bank"" isn't a thing in the North, nor is ""wi-fi"").

|Australia|1.77|

Also, Australia and New Zealand already do free movement.

&gt;The Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement is an arrangement between Australia and New Zealand which allows for the free movement of citizens of one of these countries to the other. The arrangement came into effect in 1973, and allows citizens of each country to live and work in the other country, with some restrictions. 

So I'd assume that they're stable population-proportion-wise with respect to each other.

&gt;Prior to 1973, neither New Zealand nor Australia exercised systematic control over immigration from the main Commonwealth countries (principally the United Kingdom and Canada), and New Zealanders and Australians were thus free to move between each country under informal arrangements.

2524,"&gt; Your only defense has been that making the Welsh speak English was for their own good.

It was. Speaking a unified language in one country is a good thing, it lessens marginalisation of ethnic minorities. It LITERALLY helps the Welsh to have them speak English fluently. Which is the reason it was done, to help them. The only reason I'm EXPLAINING this to you is because your hurt little welsh eyes sees it through a limited and petulant viewpoint.

&gt;And yet you are obsessively attempting to characterize English actions as moral and right.

Thats because overcoming stupidity and bias requires consistency and repetition. Roughly the same thing as was required to make sure the Welsh spoke gooder English.

I think your error is to assume that if someone doesnt agree that Person A punching Person B in the face 675 years ago is a bad thing then they must be asserting its a good thing. Its neither.

This whole thread was started to 'discuss' the acts of creating a single unified language. I note with fascinated interest you attempt to ignore that time period but consistently refer back to far earlier times.. but, if you insist.

2533,"Probably no single reason, but one contributing factor could be the degree of societal conservatism. The expectations on how you should live (""nuclear family"", ""mothers stay at home"", cost of schooling, etc) is a mismatch with reality of life. As a result, some people that would otherwise have had children find that they're not able to - no available child care, lack of sufficient income to bring up a child and so on.

You can sort of see the same kind of effect in countries such as Japan (and Korea), with very different societies but the same kind of cultural mismatch with contemporary society. A major part of Japans' low birthrate is simply that a child is not affordable for many young people that never manage to move on from temp jobs and uncertain, low-paying contract employments. Especially as cost of bringing up a child keeps rising; you often will need to pay not just for university but for high school as well.

2552,"In countries that have a lot of immigration, immigrants may have a higher TFR than those born in the country.  In the US, this exists and persists, increasingly-weakly, for a few generations.  For France, I believe that the same is also true: France had colonies and pulled people from the francophone world.

http://paa2006.princeton.edu/papers/61103

&gt;the estimated excess fertility of immigrants compared with women born in France is 0.46 
children per women during the 1990s (2.16 vs. 1.70), while the usual TFR leads to an 
apparent difference of 0.85.

I would *speculate*, though not going off anything I've seen, that the UK and Ireland probably get a big chunk of immigration due to speaking English.

In Russia, I recall looking at a TFR map a while back.  Russia has significantly-higher TFR in some areas, like Chechnya (2.62) and Tuvalu (3.35).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_subjects_of_Russia_by_total_fertility_rate

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_subjects_of_Russia_by_GDP_per_capita

That correlates with ethnic group.  Be interesting to see the correlation with wealth and with religion.

&gt;TFR is usually high for non Slavic groups like Caucassians and Mongoloid people. But for some minorities like Balkars (Caucassian) and Karelians (Finnic) it is lower than the general population. Jews have the lowest TFR among the larger groups, while Nenets have the highest for the 25-29 and 30-35 age groups, which reflect recent births.
&gt;
&gt;Out of the dozens of groups listed here, only 6 have an above replacement fertility (2.06) for the 30-34 age group. They are Nenets (2.372), Chechen (2.228), Dargwa (2.118), Avar (2.111), Chukchee (2.081) and Ingush (2.072). For Jews, the TFR is less than half of that needed for replacement.
&gt;
&gt;For the 30-34 group, the lowest TFR were for Jews (1.071), Russians (1.323), Balkars (1.389) and Belarusians (1.395). TFR for the 25-29 group gives the latest trends on birth rate. For that group, highest TFR were for the Nenets (1.749) and Chukchee (1.615), while the lowest were for Jews (0.791), Balkar (0.808), Osset (0.896) and Karachai (0.940).
&gt;
&gt;The fertility for 25-29 group is not completed and so it is difficult to predict. But comparison with 1989 census shows huge drop in fertility in West Caucassia (Esp. Karachayevo Cherkissia, Adyghea and North Ossetia) and some parts of Arctic Russia (Murmansk, Komi, etc.).",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7kinf8/why_is_the_fertility_rate_in_central_and_southern/dreqqlh/,vokegaf,1513571936

But PPP, despite all its flaws, still holds merit.

Thus, it is in fact normal/natural for them to have a significantly lower PPP-adjusted GDP per capita than their (relatively high) nominal GDP per capita.

You could absolutely buy an already-dressed salad in a marketplace. Not every food merchant was also a farmer - many purchased dirt-cheap basic ingredients and made stuff to sell.

If I then turned those vegetables into a convenient and delicious salad people could eat while they took a break from shopping and I charged three times what I paid for your fresh veggies, I'd be doing pretty well for myself, I think. I'd probably buy more veggies from you tomorrow, even. 

Like I said, most salads at the time were probably dressed in a brine dressing rather than an oil dressing, and that had a lot to do with availability. Olive oil is hard to make and expensive. Brine's dirt cheap, and also has the benefit of preserving foods. A little splash from a pickling pot could go a long way towards making those veggies delicious.

As for a 'frigidaire,' a lot of homes had a place to store perishable goods that was colder than the rest of the house. This was typically accomplished through evaporation cooling. It wasn't as efficient or as compact as our modern refrigerators, but it would keep things cool enough that your lettuce wouldn't spoil as quickly. Depending on the availability of ice regionally, some homes would have an ice box that kept things from rotting for much longer.

2634,"&gt;I look forward to your defense of the conquest of India.

See, proof of your inability to argue logically or without bias. Nowhere do I assert that it was ok for the King of England to conquer Wales (although I will get to that), but yet you imply that that is being said here. Its an utter strawman to suggest that I think the conquerors 'benevolent'. 

Secondly, your problem, apart from the bias revisionism, is that you are one of those people who want to rewrite History in light of contemporary attitudes. There is no right or wrong in the King of England subduing Wales, you cant justify it OR dispute its legitimacy, it was done at the time by the laws of the time and accepted at the time, if not by the losers. You might as well whinge that the Romans were morally wrong in invading England, that is, a redundant and pointless exercise. I get that it hurts your own fee fees that English people dont fall over their feet to apologise for something they had no control that occurred 800 years ago, but perhaps its time to grow up.

I DO note the use of a Welsh Historian to provide an opinion of what occurred in the 14th century and then extrapolating that to the 1700s and after. I get that to some people History is a short collective lump of homogeneous thought but I remain unconvinced that an attitude allegedly expressed in the 1300s is direct proof of motivation 3-500 years later.

Well even in Western Europe that wont happen unless you are there legally. If you come here claiming to be a refugee you will be housed (pretty poorly) as your immediate needs met until your application is processed. So I guess could be considered a ""social benefit"" but it isnt at any level you can lead an actual life with in these countries. 

Regardless though I agree with you that we cannot allow this migration to continue. Also while I am all for helping refugees in general we should change our laws to reflect the fact that once somebody has crossed the borders of several nations they are no longer fleeing from war.

2901,"Weirdly, that is not quite what actually happened. Delta was looking for a specific small plane that's not being offered by either Airbus or Boeing. If anything, Delta chose Bombardier over Embraer, because those two do offer what Delta wanted. Airbus wasn't even in the picture.  
  
Boeing then made it out like its 737 was an alternative - it wasn't, it is the wrong plane for the wrong routes. Too large, for once.  
  
They apparently thought they could force Delta - one of their biggest, long time customers - to buy Boeings if they just soured the Bombarier deal. Officially, they did that by requesting the Department of Commerce slap an 80% duty tariff on Bombardier planes, but the DOC then made it 300% for whatever reason.  
  
Not a good move.  
  
Result: Airbus now *does* have a plane in the sub-A320 range that they didn't previously have, for free (!!!), Bombardier has access to the huge resources of Airbus including their Alabama plant, for free, Delta is buying the competitor's planes anyway and Boeing sales execs will have to wear knee pads and bring a carton of mouth spray if they want to have any hope of ever selling one of their planes to Delta in the next five years or so. And if they manage to do so, the price will probably have to be under cost....

How can you judge PiS without basic knowledge about quality of life in here and history of Poland? You have no right to shitposting about our government just because you dont like it.

They won the election by gaining the majority of votes and now they keeping promises, reforming our country, making it simply better. To the ones who keep repeating this fake news about constitution and courts I wanna remind you that people's will is upon constitution and any right if it's bad for society. That's what our current constitution is and our judicial system. It's built on post-communist corrupted elites that has to be once and forever wiped out of our society and banned from public life. If you do not understand it you are just an ignorant. Polish system comes directly from soviet judicial system and is based on the same pseudovalues as russian judicial system. A single person means nothing in it and that's opinion of majority young lawyers I know in this country.

Let it sink in. 
I understand your concerns about ""2nd and 3d generation, but you need to realize that the welcoming society is also part of the issue. After three generations an immigrant is not so anymore.

For example, lets talk about Belgian immigration shall we? What about all those workers that came as cheap handlabor for the mines? Their sons and grandsons are fully 100% belgian now. Trouble is that a segment of those immigrants was less discriminated upon ( as in alinated and given a sense of ""otherness"" ), mainly Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. An other part of that immigration was on the other hand more cast aside (mainly Turks and Morroccans) and you get the results 2-3 generations after.

This is not a matter of religion or culture so much, its rather about how one percieves that society sees him, as an example you can get the Italian community of Charlerois.

&gt;Arbeitslager, so wird im Allgemeinen angenommen, dienten vor allem der Ausbeutung der Arbeitskraft von Inhaftierten. Insbesondere an nationalsozialistische Lagereinrichtungen wird man denken, möglicherweise **auch an den Gulag der stalinistischen Sowjetunion**. In beiden Gesellschaftssystemen waren Lager zumeist extralegale Sondereinrichtungen für Regimegegner unterschiedlicher politischer, religiöser oder ethnischer Zugehörigkeit. **Zunächst liegt daher die Vermutung nahe, dass die DDR-Arbeitslager gewissermaßen in dieser ""Tradition"" standen, handelte es sich doch phänomenologisch um ähnliche Einrichtungen. Allerdings waren die Haftarbeitslager (HAL) in Ostdeutschland keine Einrichtungen eines mehr oder weniger permanenten Ausnahmezustandes,[1] sondern sie waren ein – wenn auch besonderer – Teil des herkömmlichen Strafvollzugssystems.**

They even talk about how prison time in one of the GDR camps was sometimes seen favorable instead of the normal prisons since you got a less strict prison regime

&gt;Die Haft in einem Arbeitslager wurde von den Verantwortlichen und auch von vielen Häftlingen als Vergünstigung angesehen. Die Haftbedingungen waren gelockert, es gab keine Zellen, sondern Gruppenunterkünfte, es bestand die Möglichkeit des Austauschs mit den Betriebsangehörigen des Arbeitseinsatzbetriebes und bis 1962 bestand die Option, durch Übererfüllung der Produktionsleistung die Haftzeit zu verkürzen, ""Tage einzuarbeiten"".

18 And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. **19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”**

Please refer to the article above for more information on this. 

&gt;Nor does it say anything about priest needing to be celibates



Certainly not. Although St. Paul has told us that celibacy is the preferred lifestyle, the celibacy in the Church is an ecclesiastical law and not a doctrine, thus it can be changed by the pope. I think priests being celibate allows them to focus on their ministry. 

&gt;(that's how you get them to fiddle children)

Not really. The abuse problem the Church has experienced is a problem stemming from homosexuality, not from celibacy. 90%+ of the cases were homosexual in nature and in the past few decades the Church has done a great job dealing with this problem and ensuring it will never happen again (e.g. putting in stricter measures which prevent homosexuals from being admitted to seminaries and homosexuals being banned from the priesthood).

&gt;Also remember that one about how those that split will be split further and further ? How many factions split from Catholic church ? Too many to count. How many from Orthodox ? None (well just 1 catholic church)

What about the Oriental Orthodox splitting from the Eastern Orthodox? What about the constant schisms between the patriarchs and the ethnic churches? There are dozens of schisms between the already numerous Orthodox churches, disputes for titles and a power struggle between patriarchs/bishops. If only Christ had left an apostle in charge of His Church. 🤔

[Here is a recent example](http://orthochristian.com/70416.html), ""Church of Antioch breaks off eucharistic communion with Patriarchate of Jerusalem"".

The Catholic Church has shed a lot of heretics, but even though we are 5x larger than all the Orthodox churches combined, we are still more united.

Nice name calling. Shows how much evidence you have.

&gt;Of course National Socialism has developed over the last seventy years, just like the rest of society. 

But by this argument you could prove *anything*.  Of course the SPÖ are Stalinist redguards, stalinist redguards just have changed over the years. If national socialism has changed substantially so that its central historical policy position are by now irrecognizable, then it is no longer a good descriptor for a political ideology. If you genuinely believe what you say and still use the word then, you are an incompetent idiot.

&gt; That does not in itself save you from being rightfully accused as a Nazi when you talk, behave and act like one. 

But if the definiton of Nazi has changed and it is no longer associated with genocidal expansionism in your mind, then Strache is not acting like a historic Nazi.

Let's be uncharitable and say the FPÖ has done all these things. So have thousands of other parties in 20th century history, almost none of which were genocidal expnasionists in any way comparable to the nazis. The Nazis were all what you claimed, and then pletny worse after that.

&gt;I've read their program a while back when someone posted it on Reddit in English, it was full of retarded and regressive policies.

&gt; also remember some ad they had in an Austrian town which was showing some stabbing/murder scene and asking ""is this what you want?"" or something like that, referring to immigrants, the message being that immigrants are violent murderers that are going to stab you.

But that is not the same as being a nazi, isnt it? THere have been many many parties who have done posters like that. Almost none were nazis.

&gt;What they have in common with the Nazis is that they, like the Nazis, profit off the fear people have of others, especially those that look different and are culturally different than them, and blame some small irrelevant minority for all kinds of problems, creating a boogeymen out what is in the vast majority of cases innocent people and stereotyping them with no remorse in order to dehumanize them as much as possible, so the native population can more easily rationalize and justify treating them horribly down the line, but first and foremost so that they vote for the reactionary strongman type party that is the only one that can ""save"" them from the threat.

3122,"&gt; It’s not splintering at all. Most of the FvD voters come from the VVD who are not against immigration. 

Yes, exactly, so: splintering. The splintering of the right-wing vote across multiple parties.

The only people who don't believe VVD isn't anti-immigration are the worst of the worst of right-wing extremists who would view Rutte, a right-winger as a straight-up Marxist. It's reminiscent of the Trumpist, alt-right antics in the United States. It's SAD we imported this craziness from across the Atlantic.

&gt; The anti-immigration parties are only getting bigger since FvD was created (21 on election day in march 2017 and 29 in the polls of december 17th 2017.)

Right-wing parties losing seats:

VVD: -8
PVV: -6

Centre-right parties losing seats:

CDA: -5
D66: -2

Everything about this is awesome, and I've been expecting it for a while now. At first I was irritated by the emergence of yet another populist, far-right, europhobic, russophile, proto-fascist party. 

Then I realized FvD had the potential to splinter the right-wing as well as the right-wing extremist bastards, and I became almost giddy with anticipation.

The only thing left to do now, is for the PVDA, GroenLinks and SP to merge. They'd have 42 seats between them on the basis of this poll. 

But even if that didn't happen, this is good news. I voted VVD to stop Wilders, next time I won't have to.

Incentives for who? The lawyers and accountants who enable tax avoidance and evasion, or the people and corporations who want avoid and evade tax? In the context of the sentence, ""incentives"" sounds positive, like a reward for good behaviour. Tax evasion is a crime, so we shouldn't be incentivising anyone, we should be actively rooting out and punishing those who engage in it. As for avoidance, we should close the damn loopholes that allow it.

What that sentence says, to me, is that if we get people to promise not to engage in avoidance and evasion we promise we will create some new way for them to protect their cash from finding its way into the public coffers.","England, UK",/r/europe/comments/7kcyjk/eu_countries_are_not_tax_havens_parliament_says/drdion6/,mattatinternet,1513519482

* Heavy snowfall (to Belgian norms) in the north of the country caused a lot of traffic problems and accidents.

Most parties want to phase out nuclear power in 2025, but [N-VA] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Flemish_Alliance) wants to keep the two youngest plants open after 2025 because they fear that closing all nuclear plants will cause problems with energy assurance, more carbon emissions and will lead to a raise of the electricty price.
* Elderly care homes are getting more and more expensive every year. The average room and service in an elderly care centre costs a few hundreds euros more than the average pension. There's also a big shortage of social housing.
* The [federal government coalition] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Government) has reached a deal about the so-called ""Summer Agreement"". It's almost winter. Don't bother, all the jokes have already been made.
* An undercover reportage showed how grave the situation of drug crime has become in [Antwerp] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp) (the cocaine capital of Europe).

The drugs maffia has infiltrated the staff of the [Antwerp Port] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Antwerp) and the police, ging from corruption and bribery to actual gang members taking up position of power to ensure drag traffic.

The website has already a few cases running for reveiling problematic ties between politics and property development. This time the organisation behind the Walloon rightwing [People's Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Party_\(Belgium\)) has filed a complaint against them for publishing a story about the European political formation [ADDE] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_for_Direct_Democracy_in_Europe), of which the PP is a member, misattributing subsidies.
* Brussels Regional Minister of Mobility and Public Works [Pascal Smet] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Smet) (sp.a) has caused controversy by comparing Brussels to a prostitute in [an interview with Politico] (https://www.politico.eu/article/pascal-smet-brussels-is-like-a-whore-says-minister/). The oppostion parties in the [Brussels Regional Parliament] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_Brussels-Capital_Region) call for his resignation. Smet has apologised for his words.
* Flemish actor [Marc Van Eeghem] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Van_Eeghem) (57) has passed away due to prostate cancer. Van Eeghem has played in a lot of Flemish tv-series but was mostly active in theater. He's been in treatment for a few years, but kept acting until his death.

Paler skins (and skin colour variations) is not something that appeared somewhere and spread elsewhere, it's a very common adaptation in our species that can be observed in litteraly all known human populations.

3341,"Volkswagen did not exist. There was a competition for a car for the masses (which is what Volkswagen means in German), but the car that the nazis ended up producing was called the Kraft durch Freude (KdF) Wagen. KdF was a (mostly propaganda) national program that made luxuries available to the masses. Lots of German made monthly downpayments in the expection of getting a KdF Wagen, but when the war started, the nazis just used the money and the factory to support the war. The car was called Kommandeurswagen (commander's car) by the army and derivatives like the Kübelwagen (bucket car, so called for the bucket seats) were produced as well.

Volkswagen was founded by the british occupational government after the war had ended. They restored the bombed out KdF Wagen factory to produced cars that were sent to Britain. It was alsothem who named the town around the factory Wolfsburg after the fortress nearby. Germany later bought the company and turned it into the VW AG that survives to this day. Interestingly, the VW Typ 1 (aka. the Bug) is a new Porsche design and not the KdF Wagen, as is often said. Though obviously the two designs share a lot of elements. Another descendent of the original KdF design is the Porsche 911.

3343,"This chart can indeed be seen as part of an obfuscation strategy. Although the chart is technically correct, it is intended to give the impression that there is no immigration is not a problem in Europe.

The use of data from 2011, from before the migration crisis, while we are already several years after the start of this crisis in 2015, is an attempt at hiding the changes.

Classifying house moves inside Europe as migration, part of free movement of people in the EU and accepted by most europeans, is an attempt to minimise the problem of migration from outside Europe.

Classifying immigrants by continent rather than by religious background is again technically correct, but at the same time it is a way to avoid the discussion about the real problem. The reason why a large part of the European population has a problem with immigration is because recent immigration waves largely consists out of people that believe that their islamic faith is more important than European secular values. Contrary to the believe of the Gutmenschen, there is no historic evidence that large groups of people with strong religious believes can be assimilated even after 1000 years.

The relevant statistic is that the indigenous European population groups started shrinking as the result of the reduced fertility since 1970. At the same time the islamic population is growing at a fast pace both via immigration and via the higher fertility of this group.

3380,"Boris Johnson has called on Theresa May to strike a Brexit trade deal that gives Britain the power to ditch EU laws, warning that failure to do so would render the UK a “vassal state” of Brussels.

In an interview with The Sunday Times, the foreign secretary said the government must seek to “maximise the benefits of Brexit” and failure to get an agreement that allowed divergence would mean the UK could not do “proper free trade deals” with other countries. In a move that will create nervousness in Downing Street, Johnson announced that he was planning a fresh intervention this week, penning the case for a “liberal Brexit” because the advantages of leaving have not been properly outlined for the public.

Philip Hammond, the chancellor, sparked fresh tensions yesterday when he said the government would “effectively replicate the current status quo” in the two years after Brexit, an approach the former Brexit minister David Jones branded “capitulation”. Members of May’s Brexit “war cabinet” will meet tomorrow and the full cabinet on Tuesday to discuss what demands Britain will make when trade talks begin next year.

Johnson rounded on hardcore Eurosceptics who have called for the deselection of 11 Conservative MPs who helped defeat the government last week. He said it was “absolutely obscene” that the MPs had received death threats after backing a meaningful parliamentary vote on the final Brexit deal. “These are honourable people,” he said. “They are voting with their conscience.”

The foreign secretary said the prime minister had “done a fantastic job” in the first phase of the negotiations but the government now had to seek a “new and ambitious” trade deal that “gives us that important freedom to decide our own regulatory framework, our own laws and do things in a distinctive way”.

Johnson said that if Britain were simply forced to mirror EU laws, even remain supporters he knows “would say, ‘What is the point of what you have achieved?’ because we would have gone from a member state to a vassal state”. His words echo those of the backbench Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg.

May’s “war cabinet” is divided between Johnson’s “divergers” — big hitters David Davis, the Brexit secretary, Michael Gove, the environment secretary, and the defence secretary Gavin Williamson — and Hammond’s “aligners”, who include Amber Rudd, the home secretary, and the business secretary Greg Clark. But Johnson claimed that even Hammond would support some divergence from EU rules because it would let the government make the UK a more attractive place for tech entrepreneurs.

“It was very notable in the budget speech that the chancellor majored on the idea of future regulatory divergence,” Johnson said. “Philip can see that we have a very original economy . . . we may in future wish to regulate it in a different way from the way that Brussels does.”

Gove and other ministers will use tomorrow’s meeting to call for Britain to abandon the EU working time directive, which restricts the working week to 48 hours.

Heidi Allen, one of the 11 rebels, has been summoned to a meeting of the Tory executive in her South Cambridgeshire seat. Sources said her local party chairman, Ben Shelton, wants her removed as the party’s candidate at the next election. A source said: “Ben is apoplectic and is ordering her to explain herself. He has said there is no way she will be readopted.” Shelton did not return calls seeking comment.

You know about the Graeco-Roman and Chinese and Japanese civilizations were same-sex sexual behaviour was extremely common right? For instance:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_China#Traditional_views

Apart from this, research in the contemporary west about the fluidity of preference in gender:

https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/gay-and-lesbian-well-being/201105/sexual-orientation-is-it-unchangeable (as this points out; it's always been a political thing people said because it made sense for the rights movement at the time even though it was never founded on any scientific basis)

http://anonhq.com/new-u-s-study-says-gay-people-not-born-way-sexual-orientation-not-fixed/

&gt; The leading neuroscientist in the field has found distinct differences in the brain in people with different sexualities and that you are indeed born with your sexual preference.

No they haven't. This goes in the same bin as the supposed discovery of ""the brains of autistic people"" or ""the neurology of gender identity"".

What they have found are _correlations_ in brain structures between self-reported sexual identities and certain brain structures just as correlations with _any_ taste in brain structure can be established but these correlations are not absolute and rarely present at birth to begin with.

It's also long been known that like any taste, alcohol has an effect on it and everyone knows that normally monosexual people have a proclivity to show bisexual behaviour when inebriated. There's also the thing of ""prison sexuality"" which is often held as ""just a temporary change"" but here's the intersting part that some people _keep doing it_ when coming out of prison while proclaming they never liked the idea when going into prison. They were forced to have sex with people of the same sex out of lack of opposite sex candidates inside of prison and after a while acquired a taste for it and kept doing it upon release:

https://bisexual.org/does-prison-turn-you-gay-more-likely-bi/

&gt; You are pretty much giving weight to the idea that you should be able to ""pray the gay away"".

I doubt praying works as well as alcohol or prison or just in general acquiring a taste. God doesn't exist and won't come down to change you.

Besides the vast majority of the fluidity of sexual orientation is in the realm of moving monosexual people more towards bisexual which is in general how taste works. Acquiring a taste for something you didn't like at first is easier than learning to unlike something you always liked.

""sexual orientation"" has always been more of a social identity thing, a tribal western social label you stick on yourself like ""punker"" or ""Christian"" than an actual hard scientific concept. For one pretty much everything into the matter relies on self-identification rather than a specialist being able to ""diagnose"" a sexual orientation; it's a self-identified label in the end.",,/r/europe/comments/7k7ltb/this_is_the_arles_arena_a_1900_yearold_roman/drdd0q2/,my_honour_demands_it,1513504406

It is coherent to say that the German Government or institutions bear no responsibility in relation to the activity of the German private sector while the Greek Government or institutions do bear responsibility in relation to the activity of the Greek private sector. -&gt; F

3447,"France: Lots of stuff from me once again this week, but nothing major you guys should care a lot about, to be honest. 

- **Accident between a school bus and a train: 5 children died** and 6 more are still being treated for life-threatening injuries.

It occurred at a level crossing and it's not yet clear who/what's responsible and whether the security barriers were up or down. The kids were coming home from school and were aged around 14. 

- **Johnny Hallyday was buried**.

Johnny Hallyday is almost unkown abroad but he was (/is) a huuuuge celebrity in France: newspapers said he was ""the French Elvis"". He died at the beginning of the month, there was a major public gathering in Paris last week and this week he was buried in Saint-Barth (where he had a house). Lots of media coverage about him still. 


- **Our government counts several millionaires**.

This is not really news, it was reported back in June when Macron appointed them, but their asset declarations were published this week (something that was introduced during Hollande's mandate following the scandal prompted by our Budget Minister's tax evasion). 

Our Labor Minister weighs 7.5 millions (she used to work for Danone), Environment Minister 7.2 millions (he used to be a TV celebrity), Minister of Culture 4.6 millions (thanks to her publishing house), Heath Minister 2.5 millions, Defense Minister 2.1 millions, European Affairs Minister 1.8 millions, Prime Minister 1.6 millions, Economy Minister 1.5 millions. 

The most talked about was Hulot, the Environment Minister because he's the most famous (having been a famous tv host travelling around the world in helicopters to shoot nature documentaries for the major French private TV channel. His line of shower gels and shampoos 'Ushuaïa' is in all the supermakerts) and because his 6 cars and his boat were widely commented...

- **A Member of Parliament complained about having to eat pasta**...

Honestly it could be a ""fake news"" made up by a journalist, idk.

 A newspaper (economic, right-wing) published a quote allegedly belonging to a female MP (LREM party, Macron's party), who said that she used to earn 8000 euros per month and now with her 5000 euros, she ""had to look for her clothes that she had put in the garage"", ""eats more pasta"" and ""will have to move""... Sad!

- Also: our MPs will now be given 1200 euros per month so that they can rent a parisian housing. 1) They all have offices next to the National Assembly, which for a lot of them are equiped with a big bed (for all the MPs whose constituency is far from Paris, and/or for all the times when the debates are long and finish late at night). 2) They already earn 5000 per month...! 3) If 1200 euros is needed to  live in Paris, doesn't it mean they should increase the minimum wage and social benefits??? (Well, a lot of them used to earn around 8000 per month and their ministers are millionaires...)


- There was also a controversy about the fact that Macron is celebrating his 40th birthday at the Chambord castle, but it's not exactly that: actually he rented (with his own money) a cottage right next to the castle (and actually it's really not that expensive for the view it has, I was surprised... if you have a nice salary, look it up). 


- **A former secretary of state was being judged for rape. His lawyers managed to postpone the trial**.

2 former aides accused George Tron of sexual assaults and rape, a few weeks or months after the Dominique Strauss Kahn scandal (=IMF president and the maid he *allegedly*raped in the New York  Sofitel hotel). The details are creepy/weird because he was using his hobby - foot reflexology - and his mistress colleague to trick his victims... yep. Anyway after a first trial in 2013, the case was dismissed, but new judges had a different opinion and he was scheduled to face the Courts again starting  this week. The trial began. And 4 days later it was postponed. Why? His (famous) lawyers managed to argue that the climate was not serene enough, with all the people commenting on social media (journalists were live-tweeting it, which is normal). So a new trial should occur in about a year. Yay!

- **The government asked for a woman to be revoked from a government council on the digital economy**.

Why? Well the only justification they gave was that the debates need to be serene.... Why would her nomination prevent that? No idea... she's an anti-racism and feminist activist. She's not radical at all. (Her name is Rokhaya Diallo, yes she's black).

(And she wouldn't even have been paid for that role). It's almost as if things were really smelling bad in France...

- A comedian/radio host was the victim of witch hunt campaign, thanks to an article in a so-called left-wing newspaper, shared by people from the far-right to the left. His comments about terrorism and demonstrations of public grieving were totally misquoted. He's not radical at all, again. It's almost as if something was smelling bad in France. (Oh, yes, I forgot to mention his name: Yassine Bellatar, guess what his ethnic background is).

- **Activists are expressing their fear about the conditions of the migrants crossing the italian border, with the low temperatures**.

In the north, the police takes away the migrants' blankets. Prefects received a new order to identify the migrants living in the emergency shelters.  

Macron gives humanist speechs in front of the international community.

- **Hollande's last Justice Minister illegally informed a MP about his tax inspection**.

Jean-Jacques Urvoas (Socialist party) was the Minister of Justice during the last months of Hollande's mandate. He sent a note to Thierry Solère (at the time member of the Les Républicains party. He recently switched to join Macron's LREM party). In the note, Urvoas revealed to Solère the findings of the investigators after a tax inspection. Well done guys.

- **The main right-wing party elected its new president**.

That was last week. They chose Laurent Wauquiez, which wasn't a surprise. He's far-right (racist and unclear about the EU). Following this, a long-time member of the party, Xavier Bertrand, announced he quit the party.

So, only one person protesting isn't much.



- **The new Miss France was elected last night** : 1) people aren't happy it seems ; 2) was there a ginger conspiracy?!

We still have an annual ""Miss France"" beauty contest. [The winner is  Maéva, from the northern region](https://twitter.com/MissFrance/status/942176513662898176). Judging by the reactions on Twitter, the poor girl was not everyone's favourite. But it seems that her region is the one in which people tend to vote the most, since they won the contest 3 or 4 times in the last few years. 

There were also funny jokes on social media, because  the ceremony was held in Châteauroux, in the presence of its mayor Gil Avérous, music performance by  Ed Sheeran and the winner is a red-head (Red-head/ginger in french = ""roux"". Got it? Chateau*roux*, Gil Avé*rous*, Ed Sheeran and Miss France's hair color... sounds fishy to say the least...)

&gt; Because of its location, Belgium had to seek Dutch permission to build part of their mayoral building – the part delineated by the brightly illuminated border strip running right through the meeting room.

&gt; Given that Belgium’s planning laws are less restrictive than the Netherlands’, there are clear advantages to having a front door in Belgium [...] Kees wanted to redevelop the original building, but the front door was in the Netherlands and he couldn’t get planning permission from the Dutch town hall. He solved the problem by simply installing a second front door, adjacent to the first but on the other side of the border. So now with two front doors to the building, one of his apartments is Dutch, and the other three are Belgian.

&gt; The most flagrant example is a former bank that was built right on top of the border so paperwork could be moved from one side of the building to the other whenever one nationality’s tax inspectors came calling.",Baden-Württemberg (Germany),/r/europe/comments/7kd559/bbc_travel_europes_strange_border_anomaly/drddq3h/,nyando,1513506556

3497,"I get a bit flustered when I see people attribute one haplogroup to one ethnic/cultural groups, as if they were ""races"". Look at Iceland, which was settled by Scandinavians. It's compromised of 3 major haplogroups (which are also dominant in Scandinavia). 

The point is that populations tend to carry a specific cocktail of haplogroups, not just one. Look at Southern Italy which was colonized by Greeks.

Haplogroups also doesn't relate very well to phenotype. They work exactly like a last name that is passed down from father to son. It's a good hint, especially if you know the historical context as the case with Iceland, but at the end of the day a haplogroup is nothing more than a marker inherited by the father. If a father decides to move from Scandinavia to Africa and have a child with an African then the mulatto child would get the haplogroup of his Nordic father, and the children of the mulatto would get the same haplogroup. This is an extreme example to drive home the point but it's something that happens continuously on a smaller scale and a few generations later people of the same haplogroup can look very different.

I'll say it again: The [indebtedness](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=ds22a34krhq5p_&amp;ctype=l&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country:it:el:pt:es:ie&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false) uptrend since 2007 and especially after 2011 of the public sector is a *consequence* of the activity of the [private sector](http://voxeu.org/sites/default/files/image/FromApr2012/merler1a.gif).

&gt;The lender isn't in the business of making sure that it's a good idea for a borrower to borrow.

You can't have an irresponsible borrower without an irresponsible lender (you're basically saying that, where prostitution is illegal, only the prostitute is to blame). Further, large credit institutions are better equipped to ascertain risk than businesses and households are.

&gt;Not only is this outside Germany's responsibility, but as far as I know, Germany has no mechanism to stop private investments in Spain…

Oh, what about Greece or Spain? What in hindsight would've been the right thing, i.e. imposing tough regulations and requirements, not only would've been seen as anathema by advocates of *laissez-faire* capitalism, but it would've been illegal under EU treaties.

By the way, even if it had been possible to implement it, who would have foreseen the massive requirements?

&gt;no one at the time would ever have suggested the country should have been accumulating hundreds of billions of euros of Bunds as a precautionary measure.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;and we were talking about Greece, not Spain.

Both countries experienced the same phenomenon, albeit in different degrees of severity. Did you even bother opening the Vox article?

&gt;&gt;That is true, and it is true for the other peripheral countries as well, even though the adjustment mechanism has and is being imposed solely onto the shoulders of weaker countries which, in turn, place the burden onto the most vulnerable strata of their society.

&gt;I'm not sure what you mean by this.

Recall the [charts](https://imgur.com/a/Of8NF) with the ULCs and their components. In order to adjust the misalignments in a symmetrical fashion, Germany should be increasing its wages above the ECB inflation target while Southern countries are cutting theirs. The reality is instead that almost the entirety of the adjustment is being imposed upon the periphery.

&gt;Okay, so is your argument that ""fiscal union should have happened, but because Germany opposed fiscal union, Germany is specially to blame for Greece""?

Firstly, it's not *my* argument. Secondly, economics predicted that the euro was a terrible idea in the absence of adjustment mechanisms. I myself am against giving up one's currency for fiscal transfers as this doesn't necessarily bring prosperity in less developed areas.

I'm not criticising Germany neither for the introduction of the euro, which was imposed upon it by the French as a condition for its reunification, nor for its rejection of a fiscal union. What's surely deficient is its mismanagement of the Greek crisis given that a timely and sizeable haircut would've avoided sequelae, and the shortsighted imposition of an asymmetrical adjustment.

Surely an ECB that opaquely and discretionarily cuts liquidity as a means to blackmail democratically elected Governments is another issue.",It'll all be 0K in the end,/r/europe/comments/7k67jq/heartbreaking_letter_to_santa_greek_child_asks/drdagzs/,In_der_Tat,1513497392

strong support for ruling party isnt because how great they are or how completly they represent will of people but because how incompetent is oposition, other political parties are focusing on making goverment look bad instead of giving people better alternative and people see that and are not happy, people simply want other political parties to give them better alternatives but they are too foolish to see that.
if not for some of stupid ideas goverment has, with such weak oposition goverment actually could rule forever.

1) The communist party doesn't exist. 

2) Industrialism happened, whether xenophiliacs want to admit or not, during the communist period; *not* during the monarchy. 

3) He didn't had a problem when soldiers died at the front, yet monarchists upfront the ”but muh 1000 students” argument. How convenient to cherry-pick.

But the gist is that V4 courts have started referencing ethnocultural values rather humanist/universalist values in constitutional interpretations, building on previous developments in Germany.

This is conceptualy troublesome because it gives courts the ability to interpret adhoc facts about ""the people"" and the state to see itself as defending that interpretation along ethnic lines, seeing valid belonging only to co-ethnics and allowed minorities not to all citizens irrespective of ethnicity.

This is a deviation from French style universalist values, and will likely lead to events as we see in Ukraine with ethnocultural laws pissing off neighbouring countries that try to ""defend"" co-ethnic non-citizens from assimilation or ethnocultural-centered laws while trying to do the same to their own minorities.

3664,"&gt;I assume by ""Greek debt"" you mean ""Greek Government debt.""

Yes.

&gt;As liquidity was drying up following the 2007 financial crisis due to the exposure reduction carried out by French &amp; German banks (refer to the last chart), the public sector had to take over in this fashion:

Okay.  I'm not seeing this as a way in which Germany has acted to harm Greece.  Offering to lend money to Greece is only providing an additional option to Greece.  The lender isn't in the business of making sure that it's a good idea for a borrower to borrow.

If the US issues a bunch of bonds and France buys some, it seems unreasonable to me to complain that France has acted to harm the US, even if later someone decides that the US spent an exorbitant amount of money on highways that year and would have been better-served by borrowing less.

&gt;Freed from the risk of devaluation — and not thinking clearly about the corresponding increase in the risk of default — savers outside Spain, particularly France, Germany, and the Netherlands, started sending almost unprecedented amounts of capital into a mid-sized economy. It was the unstoppable desire of foreigners to invest in Spain, rather than the voracious appetite of Spaniards to spend more than they earn, that explains the magnitude of the inflows.

This seems even further-removed from Germany's responsibility.  Not only is this outside Germany's responsibility, but as far as I know, Germany has no mechanism to stop private investments in Spain…and we were talking about Greece, not Spain.  I don't really understand what the argument you're making is.  If it is ""countries can be hurt by joining the Eurozone"", sure, I don't disagree with that.  But the argument I was making wasn't ""everyone should join the euro"", but rather ""Germany doesn't deserve special blame for the Greek debt crisis"".

&gt;That is true, and it is true for the other peripheral countries as well, even though the adjustment mechanism has and is being imposed solely onto the shoulders of weaker countries which, in turn, place the burden onto the most vulnerable strata of their society.

I'm not sure what you mean by this.  Are you talking about currency?  Pegging currencies so as to make an artificially-high currency in one country also means an artificially-low currency in another.

&gt;I suspect, however, that he and the rest of the European elite overwhelmingly underestimated the scale of the disaster that would have followed as well as the unwillingness of core countries to share their wallet, i.e. to implement a fiscal union.

Okay, so is your argument that ""fiscal union should have happened, but because Germany opposed fiscal union, Germany is specially to blame for Greece""?

That brings me back to pointing out that it's fundamentally Greece's responsibility to determine whether joining the EZ is in its interests.  If Greece wanted to join a fiscal union, but not a currency union, then Greece should really have said ""I want to wait until fiscal union is available"".",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7k67jq/heartbreaking_letter_to_santa_greek_child_asks/drd9bee/,vokegaf,1513494579

3699,"1. That you have to conjugate every verb and the form depends on like many different different things, but mainly the gender makes it problematic and a step up from Spanish or German. Every form (almost) of every person  has three genders. For example, verb ""jeść"", ""to eat"" can be conjugated in the past tense as jadłam/jadłem, jadłaś/jadłeś, jadła/jadł/jadło, jedliśmy/jadłyśmy, jadłyście/jedliście/, jadły/jedli. This is just for past tense. If you add ""z"", such in ""zjadłam"", its also past, but something a tad different. Of course, these need to be in corcondance with the gender of the agent which can also be tricky. Not really problematic for a native, but if you want to learn Polish, I guess it's a pain in the ass. 

2. We also do it with verbs, gołota love declination! Every noun needs a correct for because we'd rather declinate than use prepositions.

My hairy ass why should we care??? These are people who came here as guests seeking safety and protection from war and yet have committed criminal offences so severe that they qualify for deportation. 

They obviously have shown that they dont give a shit about our laws so why should they enjoy their protection. Normal people (regardless of refugee or not) should not be deported into a war zone and thats fair enough.

I mean, WTF are you smoking to think Western Europe, let alone the EU as a whole, is wealthier than America? That's fucking retarded yo. lol Can you even google?

As for our contribution to Europe's political &amp; economic foundation, to quote what I already pointed out elsewhere:

&gt;[**American Committee on United Europe**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Committee_on_United_Europe)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The American Committee on United Europe (*ACUE*), founded in 1948, was an American organization which sought to counter the Communist threat in Europe by promoting European political integration. Its first chairman was ex-wartime OSS head William Joseph Donovan.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;_________
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Declassified American government documents have shown that the ACUE was an important early funder of both the European Movement and the European Youth Campaign. 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;________
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The U.S. policy was to promote a United States of Europe, and to this end the committee was used to discreetly funnel CIA funds - by the mid 50's ACUE was receiving roughly $1,000,000 USD per year - to European pro-federalists supporting such organizations as the Council of Europe, the European Coal and Steel Community, and the proposed European Defence Community.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The end of an article appearing in The Daily Telegraph in September 2000 noted that: ""*The State Department also played a role. A memo from the European section, dated June 11, 1965, advises the vice-president of the European Economic Community, Robert Marjolin, to pursue monetary union by stealth. It recommends suppressing debate until the point at which ""adoption of such proposals would become virtually inescapable""*.
&gt;
&gt;[**And**](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/04/27/the-european-union-always-was-a-cia-project-as-brexiteers-discov/)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The Schuman Declaration that set the tone of Franco-German reconciliation - and would lead by stages to the European Community - was cooked up by the US Secretary of State Dean Acheson at a meeting in Foggy Bottom. ""*It all began in Washington,*"" said Robert Schuman's chief of staff. 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;It was the Truman administration that browbeat the French to reach a modus vivendi with Germany in the early post-War years, even threatening to cut off US Marshall aid at a furious meeting with recalcitrant French leaders they resisted in September 1950. 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;________
&gt;
&gt;&gt;For British eurosceptics, Jean Monnet looms large in the federalist pantheon, the emminence grise of supranational villainy. Few are aware that he spent much of his life in America, and served as war-time eyes and ears of Franklin Roosevelt. 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;General Charles de Gaulle thought him an American agent,  as indeed he was in a loose sense. Eric Roussel's biography of Monnet reveals how he worked hand in glove with successive administrations.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;It is odd that this magisterial 1000-page study has never been translated into English since it is the best work ever written about the origins of the EU. 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Nor are many aware of declassified documents from the State Department archives showing that US intelligence funded the European movement secretly for decades, and worked aggressively behind the scenes to push Britain into the project. 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;As this newspaper first reported when the treasure became available, one memorandum dated July 26, 1950, reveals a campaign to promote a full-fledged European parliament. It is signed by Gen William J Donovan, head of the American wartime Office of Strategic Services, precursor of the Central Inteligence Agency. 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The key CIA front was the American Committee for a United Europe (*ACUE*), chaired by Donovan. Another document shows that it provided 53.5 per cent of the European movement's funds in 1958. The board included Walter Bedell Smith and Allen Dulles, CIA directors in the Fifties, and a caste of ex-OSS officials who moved in and out of the CIA.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Papers show that it treated some of the EU's '*founding fathers*' as hired hands, and actively prevented them finding alternative funding that would have broken reliance on Washington.    
&gt;
&gt;We literally threw all our weight behind the integrated economic organizations that are the EU's direct predessors, [**strongly backed the European Defense Community**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Defence_Community), striaght-up called for a European Parliament &amp; monetary union, and literally funded half the budget of European federalists in the EU's early years.
&gt;
&gt;And I didn't even really bring up NATO, truly dive into the Marshall Plan or touch upon America opening up it's booming markets to a devasted post-War Europe on a free trade-inspired basis. 

There's a good god damn reason the Iron Curtain didn't extend to the English Channel &amp; Western Europe prospered as a prosperous liberal democratic oasis after being reduced to rubble during WWII, and America is most of it. I mean shit, for as terrible as it was, even fucking Gladio played it's part in European integration &amp; defense. lol And shit like the Greek Junta *(which other European countries, not just America, helped enable as well)* were terrible, but don't sit here &amp; act like the communist opposition you cheerlead weren't a bunch of brutal tyrants themselves, propped up as a proxy by a authoritarian socialist dictators with a penchant for mass murder.

    Before there was earth or sea or the sky that covers everything, Nature appeared the same throughout the whole world: what we call chaos: a raw confused mass, nothing but inert matter, badly combined discordant atoms of things, confused in the one place. There was no Titan yet, shining his light on the world, or waxing Phoebe renewing her white horns, or the earth hovering in surrounding air balanced by her own weight, or watery Amphitrite stretching out her arms along the vast shores of the world. Though there was land and sea and air, it was unstable land, unswimmable water, air needing light. Nothing retained its shape, one thing obstructed another, because in the one body, cold fought with heat, moist with dry, soft with hard, and weight with weightless things.

3772,"&gt;So they teach you how the USA was behind the Greek junta, Turkish coups, Chilean, Brazilian, and all others, while also they teach you how your government recruited many high ranked Nazis and fascists and their collaborators, aka war criminals, and found intelligence agencies and underground paramilitary organisations with them, or how your activities gone to the point of neo fascists planting bombs in Italy and mass massacring people, or fascists mass massacring people in towns for days in Turkey, etc.? If they do, it's news for me, but then what I'm telling you shouldn't have been news for you, right? Or, did you just learnt about genocide of Native Americans without calling it a genocide, and you think your countries' crimes were limited to that, and you've saved Europe and protected its liberal democracy during the Cold War? I think it's the later one.

This is literally you just making assumptions after I told you that we do learn about our bad shit. I asked ""what the shit you are talking about"" because you're using buzzwords to further an agenda instead of just stating facts as facts. We did not start any coup in Turkey, they do coups by themselves all the time, and the UK are the ones who had control over the Greeks, not us. I don't know enough about your claims that the US funds neo fascists in Italy, but based on the rest of your Turkey and Greek claims I'm going to assume it's a conspiracy theory unless you provide evidence.

&gt;US GDP is less than the EU GDP.

Blatantly incorrect.

&gt;40% of your population falls out of the middle income bracket, 

59%, and the same PEW survey you are trying to use to show that the US has a lower middle class than the EU points out it's the case because the upper income bracket in the US is growing, not because people are getting poorer.


15% of your population lives under the poverty line, and your living standarts are lower than the EU, in the human development index and human poverty index

Poverty is measured differently in the US than it is in Europe, it's based on how many people are living in a family unit. If there are 2  adults and 2 children in a household then the poverty threshold is higher than in a household with 2 adults, which is not the case in the EU (where the poverty threshold is just 60% of the median income.) 

&gt; you're worse, and you fall behind in things like child mortality rates, free education, healthcare, income equality, paid parental leave, etc. GDP per capita isn't a great thing to measure the quality of life at the end.

Child morality data is given by hospitals in the US and Canada, while it is given by 5 year retrospective surveys in most of Europe (which is why child moratality rates are much higher in these two countries compared to the rest of the world). Along with that, many Western European countries do not report stillborn babies or babies who are expected to die soon after birth, but don't take my word for it, [even the WHO acknowledges that the differences in statistics are also based on differences in reporting the statistical information](https://www.scribd.com/document/36960555/Neonatal-and-Prenatal-WHO)

&gt; free education

You got me there, our colleges aren't free. However, we have 7 of the 10 best colleges in the world and you will have your college tuition fully paid for if you do well in high school, so...

&gt;healthcare

The US government covers the healthcare costs for anyone under the poverty line, and up to something like 1.4x above the poverty line, along with that, the US has better hospitals and the most medical developments in the world. I agree that everyone should get free healthcare, but whenever you hear a sob story about a guy who can't afford going to the hospital, there's a high chance that he either could've gotten insurance but chose not to so that he could afford a better house, or he doesn't know about the current government programs.

&gt; income equality

The US has more rich people than any other country on Earth. What's your point? Wealth isn't zero sum. We might have more billionaires per capita than Europe, but that doesn't mean our middle class has less money than our middle class in Europe (they make more money, actually.)

&gt;paid parental leave

Very nitpicky. In Europe you don't have freedom of speech, yet you don't see me making that point.

&gt;GDP per capita isn't a great thing to measure the quality of life at the end.

I wasn't using GDP per capita, I was using the actual mean wages of each country, but ok.

&gt;And world eats the American low taste nonsense since you do have the cultural hegemony. That's what cultural hegemony means mate, and that's how you're using it. If you're proud of your mass culture, and you exporting it to the world, than let's agree to disagree. It wasn't me being proud of how Europe is buying and reproducing the mass American culture, but it was you pointing out you're the ones dominating the world culture...

My point is that plenty of people seem to like whatever the US (and to a lesser extent, the UK and Japan) shit out. I think that a lot of the pop culture that America makes is fucking garbage, but when you have a cultural hegemon you can't just make masterpiece after masterpiece, you have to make shit for the lowest common denominator as well, and those kinds of people live in every country :/",USA?

3776,"Actually, PPP is like, literally, one of the most important metrics out there to compare the cost of living in different countries, which shouldn't be surprising, since it striaght-up means Purchasing Power Parity, and as such, was explicitly designed for these type of comparisons. 

Also,  you bring up the [**Human Development Index**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index), but:

* **United States** - 0.920 (*10th Place*)

* **Sweden** - 0.913 (*14th Place*)

* **United Kingdom** - 0.909 (*16th Place*)

* **France** - 0.897 (*21st Place*)

* **Belgium**  - 0.896 (*22nd Place*)

* **Austria** - 0.893 *(*24th Place*)

* **Spain** - 0.892 (*25th Place*)

* **Italy** - 0.887 (*27th Place*)

America still ranks higher than not only your country in that metric, but once again, most of Western Europe &amp; the EU as a whole.

&gt;[**Median Income (PPP)**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wage)

Fucking Switzerland opposed Hitler more than you blue-eyed fanboys &amp; that's saying something.

You've been completely Americanized. lol Same reason you're arguing with me in English on a American website.

3830,"&gt; So you say that not enough Poles have risked and lost their lives to save Jews?

No, if I wanted to make that statement, I would have written: 'not enough Poles risked their lives to save Jews'. 

What I am stating, again, is that most Poles did not help Jews. I'm not suggesting that they should have done more. Again, I'm not moralising. It is simply that empirically, most Poles did not help Jews. The idea that a majority of Poles helped Jews is delusional and unsubstantiated. So I guess I could rewrite the above to read something like: 'yes, not enough Poles risked their lives to save Jews to constitute a majority'.

&gt; Or do you think we should have intercepted trains with Jews who came here to Auschwitz from France, where the French were eagerly catching every Jew they met to show off in front of the Germans?

This isn't accurate. If French authorities were over all as eager as you suggest, then we should expect to find the distribution of casualties amongst the Jewish populations to be roughly proportional. Instead, we find that most of the Jews captured in France who died were Polish Jews who had no protections of the state, so persecution was not indiscriminate.

But this is a tangent. You should realise that outside of Poland, what I wrote is not controversial at all. You bunch have some pretty deep insecurities derived from your victim complex, it honestly reminds me of North Korea's obsession with universal ethnic moral purity.",Only Yurop glorious,/r/europe/comments/7k5ufu/90_of_polish_jews_died_in_the_holocaust_so_why/drcyvt0/,ingenvector,1513477789

3834,"&gt;Are you talking about the loans that Germany gave us or the loans we took from German banks pre 2008 which were made public after the crisis and used as a leverage to have against Greece? 

The post-crisis loans.

&gt;When you say Greece do you mean the government the people, there seems to be cohesion between those two and many more stakeholders since for example the referendum that was taken clearly said that we didn't accept any more loans so you need to define better ""you"".

The government.

&gt;Because no other country was willing to loan money, does it change the fact that something is immoral, such as impovertizing children or devaluing an economy and later on forcing it to sell its assets to them? A confusion between ethics and what is generally accepted has played an instrumental role in impovertizing Greece in my opinion.

It simply sets the bar for complaining about countries.  If one complains that Germany's terms were too demanding, but they were the most-favorable offered in the world, it seems to me difficult to blame Germany.  If one said ""all 200 countries are tightfisted skinflints that lack empathy with Greece that I feel that they should have"", I can see that at least being consistent, but singling out Germany seems unfair.

&gt;Do you believe Germany tried to gain control of Greece to stabilise the markets and its own economy, to prevent a domino? 

I'm not sure what you mean by ""gain control"".  Certainly avoiding a collapse in the EZ and Germany would have been a high-priority concern.  If you mean cutting government expenditure over time, I believe that the aim is to try to build a stable economic bloc.

&gt;Did it damage economically Germany how? 

German debt forgiveness.  The risk of a cascading failure actually happening.

&gt;When you say we changed the numbers again there is a cohesion between people and government, since Greeks weren't aware of any ""cooking"" in the numbers, that's the truth.

I agree.  The Greek public would not have been aware of thr debt situation.

&gt;Do you believe we were let in, or do you believe that the EU didn't have good knowledge of our economic data?

I would guess that there was some level of awareness that such rapid improvement would have been optimistic.

&gt;How do you know people believed that was normal

There were similar complaints when the bubble popped here — people aggreived that things had become substantially worse, after having become accustomed to the bubble as a norm.

&gt;Do you believe Germany isn't responsible at all for causing a contraction in the Greek market.

I'm sure that there weren't optimal policies taken, and in the sense that Germany was involved in the direction of that policy, I'm sure that it'd be possible to say that Germany caused some contraction.  But that's a pretty weak sense of the meaning.

In that Greece's spending was going to be greatly cut, whether via lenders simply cutting her off or a more-managed series of cuts…no, that was going to happen.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7k67jq/heartbreaking_letter_to_santa_greek_child_asks/drcz0xh/,vokegaf,1513477969

3852,"&gt; I think they actually were the only frames not affected by the bending/cracking issues found on the F-15C a few years back, because its 2-seater bomber role means it had a reinforced frame from the start.

Fair enough, although I know the F-15C is still expected to stay in service about another 20 or so years until the USAF's PCA program replaces it / complements the F-22.

&gt;Same for the Super Hornets, while not being brand new they're not quite as old as the standard Hornets, so they can wait a while for a replacement.

Some are brand new; the main reason the Navy isn't replacing it with the F-35C is for operating cost reasons.

&gt;CAS planes have always been specific platforms (or modified platforms) because they need to be stable, slow, and have big guns to engage ennemies when they're right next to friendlies, and the F-35 has none of those.

The vast majority of CAS is provided by F-16s, F/A-18s, F-15Es and B-1Bs. [[1]](http://aviationweek.com/site-files/aviationweek.com/files/uploads/2015/03/CloseAirSupport_chart2B.jpg) [[2]](https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2016/03/24/air-force-f-16s-fly-the-most-sorties-against-isis-b-1s-drop-most-bombs/) Sure, planes designed specifically for CAS sometimes have big guns, but in a world where MANPADs have proliferated through insurgent organisations and SAMs have improved significantly, flying low and slow to kill enemies with your gun puts you in a lot of risk. [In 1991 General Horner had to order A-10s to stay off the frontlines](http://mackenzieproductions.com/Gen._Horner.html) and send in F-16s to provide CAS because Iraqi Republican Guard units had shot down several A-10s and damaged many others.

Also, the F-35 is stable, can fly quite slow (it's approach speed when coming in for a landing is 150 knots) and does still have a fairly big 25mm gun (a derivative of the GAU-12 used on the Harrier and AC-130) - sure, it lacks ammunition capacity, but hell, the Su-25 only has 250 rounds for its gun and it still gets the job done.

Is the F-35A the perfect A-10 replacement? Of course not, but the idea wasn't to replace the A-10 1:1 with F-35s. When it comes to CAS, there are more and more places where the A-10 simply can't operate, but fast jets (which the F-35 is replacing) can. For the low-end COIN work, you'll still have F-35s, etc assigned (hell the USAF used F-22s to take out a drug den because they were available), but more and more will be done with turboprops and drones that cost ~10% of what the A-10 costs per flight hour.",Australia,/r/europe/comments/7k15np/spat_over_the_f35_bubbles_up_in_germany/drcznui/,Dragon029,1513478794

Hard to say about that part I think.

About the rest of your comment though, I've frequented this sub for quite a while and remember that a few years ago it was possible to have respectful and constructive discussions  between different political persuasions without getting heavily downvoted.

Now any thread that mentions refugees or the populist right in central and eastern europe becomes a magnet for t_d style people.

And I think the comment you replied to doesn't necessarily refer to building brand new condos in a fin de siecle style, but could also refer to the few architectural reconstructions (verging on totally ex novo) that happened in Germany in the last 20/30 years. 

Remember that the Berliner Stadtschloss is being rebuilt (rebuilt seems like an euphemism, since WWII bombings left close to zero ruins, and few photos of the building on which to base oneself) in place of the hideous (in more than one sense) Palast der Republik. Also the Dresdner Frauenkirche is largely a reconstruction project based on a few spare stones that happened some 60 years after the church was destroyed.

Not in the way just described. You have no idea of the amount of work, infrastructure and overhead even such a seemingly simple concept takes. This includes having a dynamic database of IP ranges to match against. 

As explained, this goes well beyond the native functionality of routers where packets are sent left or right according to routing tables.

&gt; But not counting some data is pretty ok. When you buy 5GB of data you still only get 5GB. 

No, you get unlimited for a select few large corporations, based on IP SRC and DST matching and discrimination.

&gt;  If they want to do Zero rating 

It's semantics. It's a Net Neutrality violation, as per the definition I sourced from Wikipedia, in case you won't take it from me personally.

As I explained earlier, ""Zero Rating"" is an artificially invented construct to differentiate a subset of the superset ""Net Neutrality violations"". This arbitrary differentiation is then used to justify a violation of Net Neutrality, on the grounds that we now call a subset of such violation by a different label.

This is abundantly clear if you could just visualize how this works under the hood. If you could imagine the infrastructure required to make it work.

An ethnic group, or an ethnicity, is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities such as common ancestry, language, society, culture or nation.[1][2] Ethnicity is usually an inherited status based on the society in which one lives. Membership of an ethnic group tends to be defined by a shared cultural heritage, ancestry, origin myth, history, homeland, language or dialect, symbolic systems such as religion, mythology and ritual, cuisine, dressing style, art, and physical appearance.

That isn't really true. Ofcourse everyone recognizes the shared responsibility, but in the end it's not up to the EU. The fact that Greece got so far as it did is exactly because irresponsible people were in charge and the EU had no knowledge and/or no way of intervening.

4328,"&gt;You do realize that Romania had seen the most development during the monarchical era.

Romania wasn't the pretty bohemian society you see in pictures of the 20s - it was the poor, backward, illiterate peasantry. Even after 50 years of the communists shoveling villagers into cities, almost half the population is still rural - and not living in those idyllic western european villages mind you. 

&gt;Carol the I won the Romanian War of Independence against the Turks

You mean the Russians curbstomped the Turks in their century long fight for supremacy over them?

&gt;truly modernized the country

Ah yes, just like Cuza tried and actually went through with a couple of reforms - reforms which angered all the right people and resulted in guess what - this """"""""""royal"""""""" family being brought in to stop that kind of naughty behaviour. 

&gt;built the main railway between Moldova and Wallachia from his own money

""""""""""His"""""""""" own money.

&gt;united the country 

A-H would've blown up and spit out Transylvania (just like all the other successor states) just as well without the Romanians waving a big stick at the Germans and getting its teeth kicked in a couple of months in. Oh, did you also forget that Ferdinand actually fancied the German side but joined the enemies because of popular pressure? Not very unifying there, isn't it? 

&gt;At 20 something years overthrew the fascist regime and so shortened the war by 6 months

The swarming hordes from the east didn't have anything to do with it surely, oh no. 

&gt;Elena helped over 50 000 jews escape the nazis

That would be quite the bad PR indeed. 

&gt;He tried until '47 to do all that he could against the commies

Of course he would. The only place monarch and communists mix is basements. 

&gt;his legacy being shitted all over by the stailinist pigs

Neither. FSN wasn't the only party that popped up. But I'd rather have those pigs than this fossil that wanted the good ol days where the peasants would line up to his feet because he's so much more special than those wankers. 

As for the rest, give me a break. He wanted power and glory and money (or is giving them lands and palaces some sort of gift to the Romanian spirit or some shit?). His actions were just LARPing. We would've joined NATO and the EU anyway just like the rest of the ex-red states of Europe shed the commie legacy over time and moved towards the west.

&gt;Brutalist buildings are usually formed with repeated modular elements forming masses representing specific functional zones, distinctly articulated and grouped together into a unified whole. Concrete is used for its raw and unpretentious honesty, contrasting dramatically with the highly refined and ornamented buildings constructed in the elite Beaux-Arts style. Surfaces of cast concrete are made to reveal the basic nature of its construction, revealing the texture of the wooden planks used for the in-situ casting forms.

&gt;Another common theme in Brutalist designs is the exposure of the building's functions—ranging from their structure and services to their human use—in the exterior of the building

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Style_(architecture)

4390,"&gt; Realizing that another person is in pain and feeling the pain are two different things.

From my point of view empathy is not an intellectual exercise but a deeply emotional one. How you rationalize it afterwards, is of course entirely up to you.

I'm going to break a rule and argue from a personal experience, because this is not how I know empathy. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I can't be the only one who've felt real painful sensations when addressing loved ones in despair.

&gt; If it worked like that tribalism would be on similar magnitudes cross-culturally (...)

No. My point is that kinship is innate in humans and many other species, and will manifest itself in some way or form. From an ideological standpoint, it would be wise to channel this into something that is positive and less harmful.

Our (interesting) debate started with me questioning your statement:

&gt;  It's obviously a total dual standard. Take pride and blame in your own actions but taking either for something you weren't involved in just because people who have something in common with you were is stupid.

While I agree that it is at first glance, stupid; taking a step back and thinking about this from a larger perspective, humans as you say, are not a rational species. And why would they be?

4431,"&gt;Not really, no.

So, say, you think that a family where one parent work with an income of 20k per year is worse of than a family where two parents works with an income of 40k per year because of productivity and not because of not participating in the labor force? Sorry but I think that's wrong. 

&gt;What does that mean?

Productivity isn't a universal measurement. It has a starting point, and we measure how much it improves per year. Let's take the biggest industry of Greece and Germany respectively. Shipping and Manufacturing. Say there has roughly been an order of magnitude improvement in shipping productivity since the 1960s, due to larger ports and ships, more efficient engines, GPS, and computers. So that's a 10 fold improvement in productivity. But in manufacturing since the 60s more technologies and methods allowed for a much bigger leap of 20 times more productive factories overall. 

That effectively means that the productivity of the average German manufacturer is double that of the average Greek shipping employee. If they have started with creating the same value in the 1960s, the German worker would be creating twice as much compare to the Greek worker now. But it has nothing to do with bullshit like ""Greeks sit all day at work doing nothing"". That's not what happens.

From your link:

""In fact, no reliable figure seems to be available - at least, not as a proportion of the overall amount of tax that should have been collected.What we do know is that, according to the OECD, in 2010 the Greek government collected 70.3bn euros ($93.1bn), or 34% of the country's total gross domestic product (GDP) - slightly below the EU average of 38.5%.

Greece is EL. One of them is the source that your article used. Where exactly did you see ""Greece were not the WORST, only two other were worse, that is a win I suppose.""???? The ""tax justice network"" has some pretty interesting data too if you want to look at them. Of course they will tell you the same thing. Greece always was and still is far away from the ""WORST"". At the end of the day even with these methods you can't actually measure tax evasion. That's why when someone is talking about tax-evasion being a ""national sport in greece"" is just repeating bullshit without evidence. Because:1) nobody can measure tax-evasion with accuracy.So you can't make comparisons between countries and find the worst for something that you can't measure. 2) None of the existing data ( eurostat being only one example) indicates that greece had/has a bigger problem with tax-evasion than your average european country.

4537,"&gt;No it isn't. The Hauge has been staunchly critical of Chinas actions in SCS, and shutting those lanes down is exacly the concern that people have. China is hostile to foreign investment, they have the biggest interest because concrete control of the lanes means they set the rules for one of the most important locations in global trade. 

Western media cannot be trusted to report on China properly. It's propaganda most of it, sorry to say. It's the same as when the NYT *actually* compares China's actions in Africa to colonialism. But I do appreciate that you linked. It's also inspiring that you actually found a link for the 15th Dec and I did check them all.

&gt;The US doesn't forget that China is behaving like other regional powers, it opposes it, just like everyone else at the Hague tribunal. That's why it's ships are ""being belligerent in the SCS"" in the first place. 

No, it opposes it because the US has a totalitarian mindset of needing to see itself as number 1 in the world and thus cannot accept someone else doing something independently, building up their power. Because then the ability of the US to threaten them would be in danger. The likes of John Mcain always worry about this sort of nonsense. China hasn't been at war for 40 years and is thus a much more responsible stakeholder in the region than the permanently-at-war US will ever be. Then there's the fact it's an act of hypocrisy, to demand China follow some Western international law, when the US flaunts it with impunity. 

&gt;Whether you like it or not, laws are only as strong as their enforcement. This applies to the US and the many instances of international law that we ignore, just like it does to competing global powers like China. Who do you think is a viable alternative for policing China's attempted land grab? NATO? The UN? The non-existent EU army? Maybe just a coalition of member states that will have been assembled/funded/deployed a year after China's done building their islands. 

Multipolarism, simply. No one should be ""policing"" anybody in such a way. Because they often can't act in a neutral fashion. NATO for example is captured by the US. The EU is likewise strongly-affected by the US. While the  UN is headquartered in New York and is impotent when it matters. Thus it simply needs to be based on working together, by considering each others interests when doing things. The US is terrible at this, both politically and culturally, as there's so much jingoism and militarism at this point. So for example: India, China and South Korea. They can work together and through diplomacy, consider each others interests. It sounds banal to Western ears; but this is because the West is used to just barging in. It's also a chicken and egg situation: if the US hadn't been surrounding China with so much hardware, there's a good chance China wouldn't be in this process to begin with. Thus it's also right-action which must be included and not just some nebulous concept of international law which isn't upheld when it matters most. You can see the US breaking international law when it attacked Syria with missiles and when it declared East Jerusalem Israels capital. Was there any sanctions? Any punishment? None at all. Just slight disagreement and shock. Thus until this is actually changed, there's no point in asking China to follow a legal code which is essentially created by and for the benefit of a Western power which flaunts it continuously in its own often militaristic ways. China isn't militarist at all either; but the US is forcing it to hasten military upgrades, so that it won't become the next Iraq....... But with the fake news media you wouldn't know this. You'd simply hear about *""China is building up its military!""* and then worry about what you don't understand. It's typical american modus operandi. It's like when americans worry about North Korean missiles, but don't worry about the other things in their society which are *actually* dangerous. The media is simply so bad in the US. 

&gt;That makes taking the territory of neighboring countries acceptable? Stealing is stealing, and the point of alliances and trade partnerships at large is that you come help those people when they're being encroached upon. Like the US is doing in SCS. 

Nah, ideally it wouldn't need to happen. But China must protect itself and this is likely the least problematic way of doing so. Were it for example to create an Asian NATO, the US and Europe would simply start to panic about some sort of expanding neo-Warsaw Pact. Ultimately, it's not the responsibility of the US to deal with other countries' territories. But FYI, the US and UK did the same thing, but worse: Diego Garcia is one such example. Chagos Islands. Absolutely atrocious crime against humanity. China's actions look mild by comparison. The US is not helping. This mentality needs to stop. It's a toxic mentality wherein you fake concern for others, as a means of promoting your own interests. It's a strong ""argument"" in US culture, because it plays to the self-aggrandizing spirit of being the arbiter of goodness, protecting the weak, etc.. I think americans generally uphold a high mental ideal of their country and in this regard it's a valiant spirit. But it's being abused. This particular narrative is the one from CNN: *""China is a big bad regional bully who is bullying smaller defenceless countries, we must step in!""*. That's the message. It's so pathetic. Who steps in to stop the US 50+ year embargo of poor Cuba? Or to get Guantanamo Bay off of it? 

&gt; Yes, letting hostile powers park nuclear missiles next to your border is generally something that nations frown upon. That you think the Cuban Missile Crisis is comparable to the SCS situation is telling. Your position is based more in hatred for the US than anything. 

No it's an example of the Monroe Doctrine in practice. The US doesn't allow other countries to do what it routinely does. Again, 400 military bases around China isn't a problem for you apparently, in addition to many allied nations. From the Chinese standpoint, this is dangerous containment. The US shouldn't get into it. And yes I hate US empire, because through constant terrorism and belligerence, it destroys the world and ignorant americans line up to act as apologists for it, by regurgitating their usual platitudes that their own country can't actually uphold. It's an immature culture, which likes foreign aggression and the state has been captured by an unholy mixture of billionaires, corporations and special interests; who also benefit from conflict. It's a dangerous country and has no place in Asia. I think there's a fundamental problem in US culture of being able to put yourself in someone else's shoes. Hence why you'd say nuclear missiles on Cuba are bad, but 400 military bases around China aren't. Because fundamentally, your assumption is that the US base empire is good, is necessary and is somehow contributing to balance. Yet if China had 400 military bases around the US, there'd be a national crisis.

&gt;For what it's worth, I'm also critical of the Pivot to Asia strategy (probably for different reasons than you haha), as well as our expansive military footprint around the globe. Closing those bases tends to be a political non-starter around here, in no small part because our allies around the globe get upset. 

Good to hear. You're probably brighter than most. I trust in the new multipolarity though. Countries like India, China, Russia and Iran know what this is about. From experience I can identify some common thought processes in this:

- No interference in the internal affairs of other nations. 

- No popular local militarism.

- No expansionist military bases or alliances. 

- No ideology/value pushing of any kind, except things like cooperation.

- No toppling of foreign leaders or supporting terrorist groups in other nations.

- Always considering the security interests of others, in one's actions. 

- Strong emphasis on economic cooperation. 

- Strong emphasis on independence of action. 

These are traits I like and which I think the West doesn't follow. Think about it: 


- We constantly interfere in other nations internal affairs. 

- We constantly build up military alliances and expand this way; such as more NATO spending.

- We promote the military. Or at least you do in the US. 

- We constantly talk about human rights, freedom, gay rights, etc. Bullshit all of it, since it's not for its own sake.

- We constantly destabilise countries and regions. Most recently with US/UK/French support for ISIS in Syria.

- We shit on the considerations of other nations which are our enemies; so the US belligerence in the SCS. 

- We constantly focus on the ability to dominate others. (Like after the fall of the USSR where the US Airforce spoke of ""Full Spectrum Dominance"". 

Which results in us going around the world, telling other nations not to spread their beliefs, while we tell them to follow ours. We then think we're doing the good thing because we're standing up for some platitudes which we routinely undermine; which we think supplies us with the moral highground to take any actions necessary to end hostilities. But in fact, we're simply being global terrorists who do more harm than good. For americans, it's especially difficult to get out of this toxic mentality, because it's drilled into them from when they're young. All the flag-porn, militarism, anthem-singing bullshit only promotes one thing: aggression. Then, after tearing up half the world through a mixture of supporting terrorist groups, bombing foreign countries despite international law prohibiting it and generally dominating others, americans turn to the media outlets of the day and find that *for some reason* they're hated in the world. Because apparently people don't like their houses getting blown. Which for many americans thus leads to the casual and apathetic: *""Sigh, damned if you do, damned if you don't""*. Because ultimately they thought they were helping, while in fact a complicit media hid all the atrocities and other legitimate standpoints, which would show the US to be the aggressor. This is why it's so extremely difficult dealing with the US, because americans seem to reside inside this mental bubble they can't break out of so easily. I don't blame them. It's like a North Korean trying to change his way of thinking. It's hard, after so much indoctrination. But hopefully americans will come to their senses at some point. I'm not holding my breath though.

4565,"Let me give you a little insight into how things work here.

My folks own a business. My mom does most of the paperwork and my dad normally handles the ""legwork"" going to the town hall, handling some legal stuff and going to pay the taxes. They have been self employed roughly since the fall of communism in '89 so they have been through all the transitional BS that went on.

Now, after all this time, whenever there is an inspection (health, fire dept., anything) my mom has everything the inspectors need ready at the location since they come whenever they need more money. After the inspection, she receives a fine. 9/10 times the fine is unjustified but she pays it anyway as long as it isn't an insane amount. That fine is the price you pay for not wasting half a day with an inspector looking for a payoff. If you keep showing them that you have your paperwork in order making the fine null, they will keep looking until you give up and pay up.

A lot of state hospitals are crowded, if you are in an emergency situation that didn't require an ambulance, you better have cash on you, otherwise you will wait a long time for someone to look at you. I remember whenever my grandma would go to the hospital, my mom would need to equip herself with a decent amount of bills and grease the palms of the nurses there and the doctors who would look after my grandma. Now, things seem to be getting better as far as hospitals go, or maybe it's just because I moved to a city that has different standards. I've went to the state hospital twice now and never was I even presented with a situation where I'd need to plant bills in the pockets of a nurse or a doctor.

But then when the football team wins apparently it doesn't go in reverse and everyone is suddenly proud of their countrymen and feels some kind of shared pride to something they didn't contribute to. When some Dutch person does something magnificent people suddenly share in the pride.

It happened on a massive scale in Berlin, where the majority of surviving pre-war architecture was purposefully simplified, but all occurred in other cities and towns in Germany and Austria. 

The period was predominantly ideologically driven, drawing inspiration from the modernist architectural idea that 'ornament is crime', first proposed by Adolf Loos. Old decorative facades, mainly from the 19th and early 20th century, where seen as being 'dishonest', acting as a pleasing mask for the social squalor and suffering that often occurred on the inside. 

The idea of actually going to the lengths of purposefully destroying these facades was mostly isolated in Germany and Austria.

4835,"&gt;Even if you treat your minorities worse, you'll still come out looking better simply because you have fewer of them.

And this is exactly *not* the point, I'm not sure how else to explain this since I already did in my previous post. I feel like when you read ""inequality in the US"" you somehow automatically convert it to ""(ethnic) minorities are treated badly in the US"" - but nobody is talking about minorities. If that was the criticism, your argument would be completely valid. But that's not the criticism at all. It doesn't matter *who* is poor, it only matters that there are a lot of poor people. (Unless of course, it's that black people are inherently stupider and more violent. Which might be the case, I have no idea, but that can't be the truth because that would be racist.)

In some sense this reminds me of a discussion I had about some study that compared schools and education around the world. And someone made the argument that well, the US only performed poorly because it's wealth distribution is so much different. If you factor only compare the middle class house holds of countries, the US is on par with European countries. - Which was an entirely correct statement, but it completely missed the point of the study. It didn't try to compare what educational facilities are available, it tried to compare how the average education throughout a country looks.

It's really something you should see when you like raves. It's an old Russian airbase in the middle of nowhere and it's basically a huge hippie festival with mainly electronic music. The really nice thing about that festival is that's it's basically 70.000 people with no real security, no rules, no police, at least half of the people are on drugs and you never feel unsafe or anything like that. It has a quite unique vibe for a festival of that size. 

It's quite overrun at the moment and they don't even sell the tickets anymore. You have to give them your data and they make a lottery and if you're lucky you get a ticket.

4898,"I used to work with a group of Croatians who would proudly tell me that, unlike we binge-drinking Brits, Croats don't drink to get drunk but just for the pleasure of drinking.

They undermined their point somewhat by usually bringing it up 7-8 beers into the drinking session, staggering around while claiming they were completely sober. I bet they would have thought they were fine to operate a digger as well, they had no qualms about driving home.

I never saw them have ""just one"" beer at lunch either - it was usually 2 or 3. And depending on how tired/hungry/stressed/etc you are, then even drink one can definitely impair your ability to perform complex tasks or things that require a lot of concentration.

In the UK I've had a couple of jobs where a drink or two at lunchtime was pretty common (especially on Fridays or in summer), but you were expected to know your limits and not get anything close to drunk. This was only in offices though. When I worked at a school in Austria it was usual to have a glass of wine or champagne or something with lunch if it was a fellow teacher's birthday or just before the holidays.

To me the main difference between  the drinking culture in Eastern and Western Europe is simply that in the East it is more romanticised.",,/r/europe/comments/7k0d63/corruption_in_croatia_manifested_itself_in_this/drblrvu/,taversham,1513397193

4984,"&gt;I'd argue the opposite: the view Americans have of Europe is currently more significant than the view Europeans have of America. 

That's one ballsy claim considering how much news about &amp; pop culture from America that Europe consumes on a micro level, while the flow of news coverage &amp; pop culture going the other way is tiny in comparison. 

Just look at this sub, the most *""YUROP""* posts are damn well always about America, while it's counter-part is rarely about Europe. Hence my point about *""infrequent sound byte that's randomly tossed around""* when Europe is rarely brought up in America. 

In short, comparisons to America are the rule with Europe, but comparisons to Europe are only the exception with America. 

&gt;The pan-European movement predates the cold war and it was arguably pushed to promote internal stability. The idea of a pan European culture has shifted a bit however, I'd argue that it is currently more about mutual recognition of each others qualities rather than about creating a unified culture. This sub-reddit is very pro-EU, yet most of its content is about showing off cool stuff from ones own country.

Of course it did, but America is the one shot it up with steroids &amp; speed with a safe home to grow in &amp; good job to pay for it. 

Hence:

[**American Committee on United Europe**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Committee_on_United_Europe)

&gt;The American Committee on United Europe (*ACUE*), founded in 1948, was an American organization which sought to counter the Communist threat in Europe by promoting European political integration. Its first chairman was ex-wartime OSS head William Joseph Donovan.

&gt;_________

&gt;Declassified American government documents have shown that the ACUE was an important early funder of both the European Movement and the European Youth Campaign. 

&gt;________

&gt;The U.S. policy was to promote a United States of Europe, and to this end the committee was used to discreetly funnel CIA funds - by the mid 50's ACUE was receiving roughly $1,000,000 USD per year - to European pro-federalists supporting such organizations as the Council of Europe, the European Coal and Steel Community, and the proposed European Defence Community.

&gt;The end of an article appearing in The Daily Telegraph in September 2000 noted that: ""*The State Department also played a role. A memo from the European section, dated June 11, 1965, advises the vice-president of the European Economic Community, Robert Marjolin, to pursue monetary union by stealth. It recommends suppressing debate until the point at which ""adoption of such proposals would become virtually inescapable""*.

[**And**](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/04/27/the-european-union-always-was-a-cia-project-as-brexiteers-discov/)

&gt;The Schuman Declaration that set the tone of Franco-German reconciliation - and would lead by stages to the European Community - was cooked up by the US Secretary of State Dean Acheson at a meeting in Foggy Bottom. ""*It all began in Washington,*"" said Robert Schuman's chief of staff. 

&gt;It was the Truman administration that browbeat the French to reach a modus vivendi with Germany in the early post-War years, even threatening to cut off US Marshall aid at a furious meeting with recalcitrant French leaders they resisted in September 1950. 

&gt;________

&gt;For British eurosceptics, Jean Monnet looms large in the federalist pantheon, the emminence grise of supranational villainy. Few are aware that he spent much of his life in America, and served as war-time eyes and ears of Franklin Roosevelt. 

&gt;General Charles de Gaulle thought him an American agent,  as indeed he was in a loose sense. Eric Roussel's biography of Monnet reveals how he worked hand in glove with successive administrations.

&gt;It is odd that this magisterial 1000-page study has never been translated into English since it is the best work ever written about the origins of the EU. 

&gt;Nor are many aware of declassified documents from the State Department archives showing that US intelligence funded the European movement secretly for decades, and worked aggressively behind the scenes to push Britain into the project. 

&gt;As this newspaper first reported when the treasure became available, one memorandum dated July 26, 1950, reveals a campaign to promote a full-fledged European parliament. It is signed by Gen William J Donovan, head of the American wartime Office of Strategic Services, precursor of the Central Inteligence Agency. 

&gt;The key CIA front was the American Committee for a United Europe (*ACUE*), chaired by Donovan. Another document shows that it provided 53.5 per cent of the European movement's funds in 1958. The board included Walter Bedell Smith and Allen Dulles, CIA directors in the Fifties, and a caste of ex-OSS officials who moved in and out of the CIA.

&gt;Papers show that it treated some of the EU's '*founding fathers*' as hired hands, and actively prevented them finding alternative funding that would have broken reliance on Washington.    

We literally threw all our weight behind the integrated economic organizations that are the EU's direct predessors, [**strongly backed the European Defense Community**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Defence_Community), striaght-up called for a European Parliament &amp; monetary union, and literally funded half the budget of European federalists in the EU's early years.
      
&gt;Practically, yes. Because America is an infinitely better ally than Russia and China. Theoretically though, it's easy to see a much better ally (just like how it's easy to see a better EU). 

And theoretically a socialist utopia brought about by a Dictatorship of the Proloteriat &amp; defined by a stateless egalitarian society where private property has been abolished sounds like a good thing to work on. 

But I mean...it's not though....so it's not really relevant to reality in practice.

Imagine being forced to recongnize the Americanization of your entire culture, to the point that Anglo-Canadians can't be told apart from your average American, and that the one pan-European identity is basically a artifical Americanized concept born during the Cold War. 

Imagine having to be constantly reminded that the the very foundation of your modern-day liberal democratic political system &amp; free market-based economic prosperity was only truly cemented *(in reference to the first decades of actual Canadian independence &amp; serious moves towards European integration)* under the watchful eye of American Hegemony, when U.S. influence was at it's zenith &amp; you were even more depedent on America than today.

Because this is literally the only thing they need in order to form a casus belli (which is a real term and not one invented by paradox, btw)

Do you realise how easy it is to paint Greece as a Nazi state that needs to be destroyed? There were banners set up in N. Macedonia where the cross in our flag was replaced by a swastika. We were under a military junta not that long ago. America has sanctioned or funded military interventions at least twice against us. They can and will do it again given a chance. And N.

5195,"&gt; [...] most of pre-1939 cities were smoke blackened unornamented industrial hellscapes 

This is untrue. By the time of the industrial revolution had properly swept through Europe, highly ornamented historicist architecture was being almost mass-produced. In a lot of cases, clients could order designs from a catalogue and customise as they saw fit. This is the reason Berlin and many other European towns and cities urbanised so rapidly in the second half of the 19th century. Indeed, most of the 'old' buildings in Europe come from this period of growth in the 19th century – and this isn't limited to the big cities. Bar the old towns in some select cities and towns, most of the urban architecture in Europe in 1939 had been constructed in the past 60-70 years, as a part of the massive growth following the industrial revolution. 

I suggest you actually take a look at some old photos of German (and other countries') cities before WWII. They were world renowned for their beauty, and were usually highly ornamented. 

This isn't saying that the 'industrial hellscapes' you speak of didn't exist –they did– but more often this was reflected on the inside. The facades gave an outward appearance of grandeur while the insides were often cramped and squalid – but this was true in most of Europe, even in those buildings that have been saved and are admired for their beauty today. Standards of living can increase without levelling the old architectural stock. 

I suggest you look at some of the old prewar 'industrial quarters' in European towns and cities. Some remained industrial and have experienced demolitions, while others were gentrified and give a better insight into what they looked like – from the outside at least.

5243,"&gt; It comes back to Catalonia not putting forth the effort

But what is this effort ?

Let's imagine we are in a heavy Catalan-speaking area, so that naturally lectures are mostly in Catalan. And one guy decides to enroll in the ""Castellano program"". What do you, create a new separate class, and schedule, for one guy? Not only that:  Catalonia _would be effectively mandating_ in which language can professors lecture in a room, something that is not even currently happening yet doesn't prevent the media from already complaining about it. 

And, not only that, but this is a school that we are talking about. For young children. Can you even imagine what would happen to the few kids in the ""special"" lecturing session? Ostracism would be _inevitable_. I can already see the headlines everywhere: ""Child marginalized in school for speaking spanish. "" 

(Eventually, the government ends up forcing all lectures to be in Spanish to solve the ""segregation problem."" With the current winds, TBH, I can see that happening in less than a decade. )

&gt; so we know it's feasible.

But we also know that the current acceptance for bilinguist policies in Spain is hard from ideal. You would not believe the amount of people that believe that the natives speak those ""regional"" languages just to annoy people. About 1/3 of the Spanish population has a native tongue OTHER than Spanish, yet these languages are all forbidden in the Spanish parliament.

&gt;  do you not find that to be potentially problematic if a child is for example, an immigrant from South America, or even just another part of Spain that only speaks Castellano, and has trouble picking up Catalan trying to learn?

This argument is powerful, but very demagogic. All I have to do is to replace replace ""Catalan"" with ""Castellano"" or ""Français""  and ""Catalonia"" with ""Spain"" or ""France"" and you have the same thing:

&gt; do you not find that to be potentially problematic if a child is for example, an immigrant from South America that only speaks Castellano, and has trouble picking up French trying to learn [in a French public school]?

What would happen in France? The school would put you in French lessons. Otherwise you risk getting marginalized/ghettoized on the street. 

This is exactly what will happen in (catalan-speaking) Catalonia. As in France, Catalan lessons are free, for citizens or not. 

So, no: I can't see it as a problem. If I saw it as a problem, I would be forced to believe that having public schools in _all languages known to man_ would be a requirement for this country. 


In addition, at the end of the day, it is even potentially illegal for the government to offer you something in Spanish ""because you don't know Catalan"". That's what is written on the constitution: as a citizen you have to know _both languages_. If you don't see why this law exists, see the following example:

&gt; do you not find that to be potentially problematic if a child is for example, an immigrant from Catalonia that only speaks Catalan, and has trouble picking up Spanish trying to learn [in a Spanish public school]?

Then ask around what the reaction of the average Spaniard would be in this situation. 

To avoid wasting time, I'll summarize it: ""Catalan that does not know Spanish? Burn him at the stake"". 

So actually, every one has the obligation to know the official languages _precisely_ because they did not want to end up in the situation where people in the peripherie of Spain start to drop Spanish. But, that sword swings both ways. Therefore, the public education system _in Catalonia_ has to guarantee that all pupils know _both_ languages, but does not need to teach them in any of them.

5250,"&gt;Well - I admit that I support Polish government - but this is pathetic.

That was obvious already, but at least you're honest w your bias.

&gt;Now Poland is being threatened over judicary reforms - more fiercly than Putin was for slaughtering tens of thousands of people in Ukraine alone - and pushing many more into extreme poverty.

1. Poland is in the EU, an organization with standards that would never in a million years accept Russia in its current state. Of course they're expecting more of Poland and they are more disappointed when Poland fails than when Russia does. Russia is Russia and that's all there is to it.

Romania doesn't have the economic muscles nor the geopolitical location, it seems to lack politicians like Orban.

5343,"With such things it's also important to keep in mind the situation before and after, though. You can't just look at a country and compare it to *your* personal situation, as this would ignore the challenges Soviet Russia or other socialist countries have faced. Average life expectancy / quality of life rose dramatically compared to Tsarist Russia, and experienced a sharp drop after returning to capitalism. The abnormally high literacy rate is likewise connected to the [Likbez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likbez) program, although it should be mentioned that Russia still seems to spend a lot on education today.

I also don't think you can just lump everything that has something to do with equality together into a single bucket, even if you're right in that they are somewhat connected. But both feminism and abolitionism are way older than Marx, and just like any other, each ideology has a different ""specialization"", a different evolution and developed different means of advancing its goals, depending on the political climate of the times.

If things have ""gotten worse"", I would say this is to be attributed across the political spectrum, as a result of social media creating lots of small echo chambers for people to radicalize in, rather than actually engendering civil debate between people of opposing opinion -- or, worse yet, actively promoting conflict. At the end of the day, we're still a long distance off from full equality (as recent backlashes have proven), but with public discourse now largely devolving into shouting matches, I'm not sure anyone can make any progress on anything these days. It will be interesting to see for how many years this awkward position will persist, though it seems to be somewhat worse in the US than in the EU.

5388,"&gt;So it would be a strange 'act of conquest' to then wait 500 years before bothering about the language. The move to one language (English) was more part of a unification push, deliberately designed to homogenise the community as a whole, especially after Scotland joined.

A push from one group, involuntarily onto another. It was an act meant to solidify the conquest, which is why I said act of conquest.

&gt;The idea of cultural conquest wasnt really prevalent at the time. I think your error is to assume the attitude and beliefs of today on to people of the past and applying modern concepts on them.

The idea of cultural conquest is ancient. You've literally just said 'The move to one language (English) was more part of a unification push, deliberately designed to homogenise the community as a whole, especially after Scotland joined.' 

A unification push from a conqueror onto a conquered people, aka a cultural conquest.

&gt;IF you look further afield you'll see choosing one language for all was practiced in a wide array of countries

As there was no choice there can be no choosing.

&gt;Also you've misunderstood the 'our benefit' thing, either deliberately or in error, the aim wasnt to destroy your culture, but to ensure that all people spoke (and thought) the same.

No, it was to ensure that all people spoke (and thought) like the English. Anyone with basic understanding of Welsh history can see that it is a conquered country. Your rebuttal that the attempted erasure of the Welsh language was done *for the Welsh* is pathetic when taken with the centuries of suppression of 'Welshness', for example, the assimilation of the Welsh Church.

&gt;If this had never occurred and only 10% of Welshpersons could speak English in 2017 that WOULD be a a detriment overall, given that the majority of people in England and lowland Scotland would be speaking English, never mind the world at large. The Welsh, Scots or even the Irish arent attempting to expunge English for obvious reasons, it has huge advantages, then and now.

Exercises in such extreme hypothetical are pointless. If England hand't conquered Wales, history would be completely different. Maybe an independent Wales would have chosen to learn English, it would have been their choice to do so though.

Well, actually it does. In the past decades doctors have changed a view on a lot of mental illnesses, recognizing some new ones, disregarding old ones. 

And that's one of the main differences between science and religion. Science is flexible and works on the basis of evidence. There's no shame in being wrong in the past and rewriting laws and changing beliefs.

Europeans have to do everything by the book, which means everything has to go according to the paperwork, except the things which aren't mentioned in the written law or where there are loopholes left somewhere.

If the law clearly implies you can't do it but doesn't actually say you can't do it, on the other hand ... 

This is partly what makes the Anglophone legal system less corrupt and bureaucratic than the European ones. The law is seen as a kind of moral arbiter in itself, rather than something that was created by humans to serve our needs, and so if the law is not perfectly calibrated to prevent corruption and lay out in simple terms what's okay and what's not (which it rarely is) then even Europeans who aren't of a corrupt or bureaucratic bent are socialised to see no problem in gaming the system to get what they want, since if you can do that it's the system that's wrong, not you. This is obviously the philosophy of lawyers all over the world, but the lawyers rule the roost in Europe unlike in the UK and US where politics is much less fixated on legal jargon.

&gt; Acting high and mighty when your oponent is weaker and cowering whe he is stronger - is double standards.

Yeah ... there is double standards in politics everywhere. Moral values really only come into play in domestic policy, when they align with the policy being pushed for justification. 

&gt; That is why many Poles stopped respecting EU. All values vaporised as soon as stronger opponent appeared.

You find this sentiment all over eastern Europe. But your good politicians will also realize the greater strategic situation and know their room of action is limited. A drastic move that worsens relations with the EU will mostly hurt Poland and strengthen the Russian position (that's what they are trying to achieve in the baltic states in general). But ultimately it will result in a lower standard of living and a big political backlash. 

I really can't think of any feasible scenario in which Poland could pick a fight with the EU without massively hurting its own interests. They will exchange angry rhetoric (as we can see here) to stir up public support on both sides, but in the end the Poland has to cave.

The politicians of our russophilic socialist party have made some deals with Russia which are totally unfavourable for Bulgaria. For example we buy the most expensive Russian gas in Europe. You'd think our good relations would have been beneficial for us but in stead we just get robbed. Same for Serbia, which also buys some of the most expensive Russian gas.      

The russophilic party also tried to make a deal for the construction of a nuclear power plant. Of course such a big project mired in Bulgarian and Russian corruption would probably be a shitshow.   
Studies indicated the power plant isn't even needed. A different party came to power and started to cancel the project. Meanwhile even though a deal for the power plant hadn't been reached and the money the Russian company wanted kept shooting up, some politician, obviously bribed by Russia, signed an order for the first reactor...     

We refused to honour it and last year Russia successfully sued us in some international court so we had to pay 1 billion euros! for a useless reactor of an even more useless project.      

This is not to mention that through its media machine Russia helps the most corrupt parties and politicians which are little more than puppets who would sell the country if they had the chance. Russia also propagandises policies here that would be very harmful to Bulgaria if enacted.      

Thank God we joined the EU while Russia was too preoccupied with itself otherwise I can't even imagine the information war that would happening to stop us.

The FRA-study was authored by the same author of [this study](http://kantorcenter.tau.ac.il/event/new-position-paper-different-antisemitisms-three-distinct-forms-antisemitism-contemporary).

The author attempts to explain the discrepancy between the ADL-study and the FRA-survey, and attempts to describe Sweden as some sort of ""unique case"" because of the incredible contrast between the two.

But what if the ADL-study is accurate and the FRA-survey isn't? 

In any case, the author attempts to explain the discrepancy as follows:

&gt; What could explain why the Jews in the country with the lowest level of classic antisemitism in the population, Sweden, manifest the highest level of fear and avoidance behaviour when it comes to manifest one’s Jewish identity (cf. Figure 17 and Figure 18.)? 

&gt; Two factors appear to be in operation here: one is the fact that Swedish Jews are, as are most inhabitants in Sweden, rather indifferent to religious practices and symbols as such. It is not so important for most Jews in Sweden to openly manifest their often very strong Jewish identity by carrying religious symbols, since their Jewish identity can for the most part be described as “ethno-cultural” rather than “religious”.^13 With a very few individual exceptions, there are no openly orthodox Jews (in terms of dress-code, etc.) in Sweden. Sweden is a highly secularized country and symbols and manifestations of religious affiliation are not part of daily life in Sweden in any case. 

&gt; The other significant factor in this context is the fact that public critique of Israel is almost ubiquitous in Sweden. Those groups and persons who are prone to Israel-derived antisemitism might find a kind of tacit understanding – however misinterpreted! – or even legitimization of their attacks on Jews in that framework. At the very least, many Jews in Sweden may harbour that fear. In Sweden, not least in the city of Malmö, perpetrators of Israel-derived antisemitic attacks might have felt that they are somewhat understood, if not excused, by statements by the then leading political power-holder in the city (Ilmar Reepalu, representing the Social Democratic Party). **In this connection, it should be noted that actions based on Israel-derived antisemitic sentiments tend to manifest themselves in violence and threats to a much greater extent than the other kinds of antisemitism.** Consequently, since carrying things that flaunt one’s Jewish affiliation, or visiting a synagogue is not so important for most Jews in Sweden anyway, but doing so might trigger attacks based on hostility and anger towards Israel, it might be understandable that many Jews in Sweden tend to avoid manifesting their Jewishness in public – even if they, as we know from other studies,^14 for the most part have a quite strong Jewish identity.

&gt; The purpose of those who attack Jews in Europe based on their hatred for Israel is clearly to arouse fear in the Jewish community living in these countries and they actually seem to be succeeding. This is also the idea of ISIS (Daesh): one effect of their actions is the “destruction of the Grey Zone”, i. e. to create political polarization and disturb the fabric of civil life – in this case civil Jewish life. 

&gt; One important point in this context is that even if violent attacks are not frequently experienced, the very fact that they have taken place – and that there is a constant threat that they may occur again! – is enough to trigger fear. This might be comparable to a pyromaniac operating in a residential area. Most inhabitants in the area, or even neighbouring areas, would feel justified in the fear that the pyromaniac would choose their house for his next attack – even if the likelihood that this would indeed happen is actually low. Nevertheless, probably none of them would claim that the actions taken by the pyromaniac are only the “top of the iceberg” of an underlying “pyromanianism” in society. 

&gt; However, when it comes to Israel-derived antisemitic attacks on Jews, certain commentators tend to do so. Such attacks are often – rightly or wrongly – interpreted as the top of an iceberg indicating an underlying and widespread antisemitism in society. It should be observed that this is fully in line with the ambitions of the antisemitic perpetrators. It facilitates their exploitation of the attacks for their political purposes. **However, there are also other political forces that have an interest in exploiting Israel-derived antisemitic attacks, often instigated by certain Arab/Muslim groups (as they have proven often to be,) for their own political purposes. One such political force is the populist anti-Muslim camp in the society. For them it is easy and more than tempting to generalize from single cases and to make claims like: “Look! That’s how they are! We cannot have “these Muslims” around in our society!”**

&gt; Another political force also interested in generalizing and exploiting fear and antisemitic attacks for their particular political purpose, is the Zionist camp: “Look! That’s how it is there (in Sweden/ Europe). Antisemitism is ubiquitous in these societies. It has just manifested its ugly face again. Jews cannot live there.” (Implying: move to Israel, i.e. make aliyah!) **Our question is: Is there really an “iceberg of antisemitism” underlying the violent antisemitic attacks that we can indeed observe? Or are we dealing with certain “pyromaniacs” creating fear among the inhabitants, plus certain, but seemingly opposed, political forces who are successfully exploiting such fears for their particular political interests? Either conclusion is in need of empirical evidence to back it up.**

They usually don't actually. A couple of capable policemen can easily handle any criminal physically, thus removing the need for escalating  and drawing their guns.

5549,"&gt;You blame America and Israel for Muslims marching in the streets shouting how they will kill every jew and then a couple of them molotoving a synagogue..in Sweden. 

I say there's cause and effect and that there's other reasons. Which were ignored in the article and thus the article itself is doing that thing. I don't deny that XYZ is bad, but these pieces don't talk about possible causes; like the US wars. 

&gt;And liberal media has and uses every chance to comment on an attacks done against muslims, even if most people here would view them as local news if it was the other way around. 

We'll need to disagree. Liberal media long since lost its credibility with me. The contradictions, hypocrisy, censorship by omission and many other things, mean I no longer trust them. Like many, I used to sort of trust the ""respectable"" papers like the NYT and the Guardian. Not anymore. There's deception is subtle. 

&gt;Indeed, you for example. The fact that you are apologetic in this very thread and address America attacking ME and Israel taking land makes it obvious. These things have NOTHING to do with Sweden. Sweden did not participate in this. Why not mention the Crussaders while you are at it?

The US-led attacks on the ME led directly to the refugee crisis, which created a huge influx of Muslis, which thus in turn had consequences for Sweden. Seems logical to me, that you go to where the problem came from. If you don't, you can sit all day and talk about how bad radical Muslims in Sweden are, how bad the attacks on Jews are, how much protection institutions need, how rampant anti-semitism is, *without actually* changing anything. After all, you'll be ready to destabilise yet another country, using the same strategies: 

- X is a dictator.

- X did human rights abuse. 

- X used or has WMDs. 

- X is threatening our allies. 

And so forth, down the list. So it actually has a lot to do with Sweden too. It's like if you get the flu and we talk about your symptoms. Puking, headache, soreness, etc. etc. We can spend all day on that. But if the cause for getting it was you spending lots of time outside half-naked in the cold for example, then maybe you should stop doing that? Surely you can see what I mean. 

&gt;Strange, I was going to say you are an islamist as well. When did you see me supporting Israel or zionism? While here's you defending anti-semitism in Sweden. Why call me a Nazi after that? Did I ever yell I support my race/religion, how superior it is and how everyone else should be genocided? Guess who has though. You obviously do have something against me.

I said probably. Because most people who turn out in defence of this sort of thing, tend to hold the same opinion. While by contrast I didn't at any point defend anti-semitism, nor did I ask for protection of Muslims and I didn't refer to Muslim-media to back up my arguments. I also didn't call you a Nazi, but it's my lament at how pointless the labels are. People like me get called anti-semities, which is just as senseless as calling people who defend zionists, Nazis. Which was my point. I don't know your history either and if you said those things. But again, if you're against genocide, you'd presumably be against it regardless of who did it. But with the ME' wars, people change. 

&gt;Why don't you post something about marches being made against Muslims in Sweden with the idea to murder every one of them. You seem to be really aware of it, even though even the media is not talking about it. Would be better than being apologetic and pretend to be an anti-zionist only.

I'm not pretending anything. I only see fake outrage from you right now. I don't see the logic of why I need to post about those marches; does it help? It's already clear there's an anti-Muslim feel many places. Hence my logic is that the West stops creating the habits which cause many of these issues: war in the ME, pro-Zionist media which only highlight their own side and the labelling of dissenting opinions as ""anti-semitic"".

This resonated with elderly voters,of which PSD has a sizable chunk of that basically always guarantees them a fuckton of votes.

5594,"&gt;Your whole attitude from the first sentence to the last is hostile, full of biased presumptions and you also give contradictory statements.

Feel free to point out the contradictory statements, mightve missed something. 

&gt;you have ""given up"" and yet you have initiated lawsuits? Where?

""halduskohus"" you cannot go to echr or any other eu court until youve exhausted local options, which takes time. 

&gt;maybe your lawsuits are completely baseless and just wasting time and resources, maybe they are for great purposes.

well theyre not baseless, but i dont know how to prove it, I dont intend to publicly post the papers either. 

&gt;Maybe you're trolling, maybe not.

I definitely have nothing better to do. 

&gt;Why do you think I would justify the government in any case? I definitely wouldn't. Self-criticism is very important to any proper society.

Experience. every level of estonian government, including the individual workers (i mean they are people? ive been told that it isnt worth treating me because im a net negative on haigekassa, by one of its directors. so my life isnt worth anything to them) there have justified the government. the few people i told about my issue in r/eesti justified the government. only two people ive talked to (not including my lawyer) did not justify the government. Now add the estonian/russian uneducated fossils that live here who think lgbt people are icky and would vote/protest against ANYTHING that would help lgbt people. the gay marriage example is fantastic here, there are people literally campaigning against it, on the basis that it hurts their feelings. 

I dont assume anything good out of estonians anymore. I assume everyone is a piece of shit until proven otherwise, I obviously dont act as hostile IRL to people because im not retarded, but this is the internet where i can speak my mind without repercussions. I used to think that people were reasonable and mostly nice. That changed when people proved themselves to be pieces of shit ultimately. 

&gt;However, it is difficult to do that when a person has basically written off this society as worthless piece of shit

what else am i supposed to do? most people living in estonia are very regressive/conservative, against lgbt people in one way or another and generally not very nice to be around. Not everyone, but most. what else am i supposed to do? glorify it? 

&gt;has apparently some huge personal grudges against the state.

it tends to be that people get some massive personal grudges if the state says that everyone has access to free healthcare, EXCEPT lgbt people, who we will restrict however we want, regardless if it kills them. 


&gt;I also don't understand why you think LGBT issues here are so bad, as basically Russia-tier.

I dont know where to even begin. I wish i could show you some of the shit social ministry has written in response to the lawsuit or some of the shit theyve lied about. I realyl have no idea how to even begin describing the crap estonia does. I'll think about it and send you a message later when ive figured it out. Im about to have some food, but ill send you something more coherent after that. 

&gt; don't know what social groups you hang around with, but mine is definitely the more tolerant one. The Estonian-speaking, generally educated, youth

You mean the minority of people within estonia? young people are a minority. and not even all young people are *for* lgbtl, plenty are against. 

&gt;Also, the government sucks on the issue, but it sucks less than Latvia-Lithuania level of just ignoring it completely

Uh, Hello, our government *literally* ignores these issues. this is quite literally exactly what they do all of the time, until someone forces their hand via a lawsuit or public shaming. they do not do anything unless forced. 

&gt;Russia-tier of widespread campaign against them.

Oh yes, instead of the government campaigning against lgbt people, You get people like varro vooglaid to do it. Not as bad i'll admit, but still pretty bad. 

remember, these people are why gay marriage is not a thing in this country. 

&gt;And finally, I have not attacked you randomly, you should just make some more sensible criticism and explain it more, rather than be 2/3 about what inferno is living here and then 1/3 maybe about the problem.

my original message in this thread wasnt meant to be sensible criticism, just blowing off steam. 

&gt;Sorry, but if you came with such an attitude to me, I would also ignore you. And if you use that everywhere, you might get the feeling that nobody cares or does anything. 

That attitude only came after i realised that no one cares. i was *much* nicer to people 3-4 years ago. ",,/r/europe/comments/7js4jf/timeline_of_samesex_partnership_rights_in_europe/drae67j/,marlzei,1513346193

5628,"&gt;It’s entirely possible to be critical of Israel without being anti-Semitic.

Not according to Zionists. Your idea of ""critical"" is the same as the US one: superficial critique which allows for the appearance of critical thinking and morals.

&gt;Bibi is trash and an antagonistic piece of shit and the West has been far too enabling of his bullshit. 

Fine, except that's not critical of Israel, but a specific person. 

&gt;It’s also possible to be critical of the intense hatred that the ME has for Jews in general which is now bleeding over to hating on Jews that don’t even live there.

Of course it's possible. Being critical just usually only amounts to condemning Muslim actions though and not the often legitimate grievances which brought them about. Again like the US wondering why people hate it, after it destroys their countries and supports terrorist groups, to topple foreign leaders. 

&gt;If white supremacist groups started shouting “Shoot all the Muslims” I’d be just as sickened.

You'd be officially sickened perhaps, yet nonetheless, as with the rest of the establishment, condone indescriminate bombings and attacks on Muslim countries. In other words, merely the illusion of care, because it's more about symbolism than reality. After all, Muslims are mistreated in Gaza all the time and yet nothing is said. Including when it's the UN which says it. 

&gt;Why on earth should Jews in Europe live in fear because of what a country in the ME is doing? 

They shouldn't ideally. But when you call it a ""Jewish state"" and equate real critique of it with anti-semitism and thereby say that the Israeli state represent all Jews, then it must logically follow that all those Jews are responsible for Israels often illegal actions.  But again, there's plenty people in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria who deal with fear on a daily basis, to a higher degree too. Including because of Israeli bombing attacks. But nothing is said about this.

While in past (just like to say in 2005) it was seen as a taboo and plenty of words to refer to gay people have been used traditionally as derogatory, now things have quite changed. Not that the stigmas towards gays have completely vanished, but there’s gradually more acceptance towards same sex relationship.

Even by looking at [the polls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition_of_same-sex_unions_in_Europe?wprov=sfti1) and recent developments in legislations around Europe in matters of LGBTQI rights you can see that in recent times great strides have been taken on this path. So, if a country like mine, which was and in some ways still is dominated by religion in politics, managed to take such action, why can’t anyone else in Europe (and the world in general) be able to do the same?

After the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, Sweden’s foreign minister, Margot Wallstrom, explained radicalism among European Muslims with reference to Israel: “Here, once again, we are brought back to situations like the one in the Middle East, where not least, the Palestinians see that there isn’t a future. We must either accept a desperate situation or resort to violence.”

So in other words: 

- The suffering of some people aren't worthy. But you want us to care about Jews.

- Boogeyman? As if Israel hasn't been breaching international law for decades? 

- As if Israel hasn't been continuously expanding? 

- As if Israel hasn't been at war with half a dozen countries? 

- As if Israel hasn't re-taken East Jerusalem, thanks to the US, against international law? 

- As if Israel doesn't suppress and control Gaza entirely? Whereby you only report on it when there's a rocket going in the direction of Israel itself. 

There's no boogeyman. There are however some legitimate grievances; which you see fit to ignore completely. Yet in the same breathe, we're meant to sympathise with ""your people"" and their suffering? This is hypocrisy you know.

&gt;But the problem has grown so dire that it finally forced Mr. Lofven to admit in an interview this month: “We will not ignore the fact that many people have come here from the Middle East, where anti-Semitism is a widespread idea, almost part of the ideology. We must become even clearer, dare to talk more about it.”

Widespread idea? It's not for nothing you know. Also, you ignore all the places which were multicultural and where people didn't get at each others throats. But you destroyed these places.You know, Syria is the latest example. But at any rate: 

- How does this explain the far-right? 

- If you want to become clearer and dare to talk, why don't you examine some of the potential root causes?  Or are we to think you're content with just calling it radicalisation and that's it?

&gt;On Dec. 6, Sweden’s state TV attributed President Trump’s announcement on Jerusalem to the supposed extreme strength of the so-called Jewish lobby in the United States. The channel later apologized. TT, Sweden’s leading news agency, cited ”influential Jewish donors” in its analysis of the move. “Attack against synagogue linked to Trump,” was the headline chosen by Swedish Metro to explain the fire bomb attack in Goteborg.

Which again shows how you lie to yourself. **The Jewish/Zionist lobby IS** super strength in the US. Ironically, they're now silencing you. [It's called AIPAC, check it out. It's not some secret or myth. It's out in the open.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_qJiid6l1k) 

[Or how about when an Israeli diplomat wanted to take out UK MPs?](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/07/israeli-diplomat-shai-masot-caught-on-camera-plotting-to-take-down-uk-mps) 

Or perhaps [when Helen Thomas was shamed in US media for going against the grain?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xy_cUpxT884) 

The fear of being called ""intolerant"" cuts both ways. Both in terms of talking about the problems with Muslims, but also with the problems with Zionists. 

&gt;There are many areas in which Israel deserves criticism, but the Swedish press often crosses the line into vilification of the **Jewish state** and regularly insinuates that events in the Middle East are directed by powerful Jews in the West. This risks stoking already dangerously high anti-Jewish sentiment.

This is so blatantly the rhetoric of a zionist. Do you want an example of a powerful Jew? [Jared Kushner, related to Trump.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Kushner) Has he met with Benjamin Netanyahu? Yes.  

Or [what about when a UK politician was fired for lying about meeting with Israeli politicians](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/08/priti-patel-forced-to-resign-over-unofficial-meetings-with-israelis)

&gt;Patel met the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The meeting was not authorised in advance and no UK officials were present. She later claimed the Foreign Office was made aware of this meetings and others while her trip was under way.

&gt;Meanwhile, Patel’s deputy Alistair Burt and David Quarrey, the British ambassador to Israel, were meeting Michael Oren, a deputy minister at the Israeli prime minister’s office, according to the Jewish Chronicle. According to notes of the meeting, cited by the paper, Oren referred to Patel having had a successful meeting with Netanyahu earlier.

But you don't talk about this, now do you. Why? You destroy your own credibility, under the guise of wanting to protect Jewish people. I wonder, do you also want to protect Haredi Jews, who don't like the existence of the state of Israel? [Probably not, if these things are anything to go by.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me4FqdrmVBs)


&gt;For starters, there are growing demands from Sweden’s Jewish organizations for the state to do more to protect them. These days, Jewish institutions rely heavily on member fees and their own security organizations for protection. But keeping citizens safe is a basic job of the government.

Basically like when asking the IDF to further marginalise Palestinians and Ultra-Orthodox Jews. We can agree to protection. But the notion of protection is a bit hilarious when the US and Israel directly broke international law by agreeing on Jerusalem.

&gt;It is also vital for Sweden to adopt a coherent strategy to combat radical Islamism. The country has become one of Europe’s richest recruiting grounds for Islamic State fighters. Five people were killed in an Islamist attack in downtown Stockholm in April, and Swedish Islamists have been involved in other deadly attacks in Europe, including in Paris and Brussels.

Bad? Yes. Always is when people are killed. 

AKA reads just like fighting Hamas, Fatah, Hezbollah, etc.. Nothing is different.  Let's also [not forget who supported ISIS in the first place.](https://medium.com/insurge-intelligence/secret-pentagon-report-reveals-west-saw-isis-as-strategic-asset-b99ad7a29092)

[I'd recommend asking one of the Israels best friends who created ISIS.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbZDyr2LkdI)

&gt;One aspect of this strategy must be for the authorities to regain control over immigrant neighborhoods, where organized crime is rampant. In addition, Sweden has had a laissez-faire attitude toward religious schools, tax-funded through a voucher system. This has allowed extremists to exert influence over the minds of young people. Taxpayers shouldn’t have to fund radicalization.

Why do you say ""immigrant"" neighbourhoods instead of Muslim? Or are you insinuating that the actions of a few extremists needs to result in corporal punishment, for all non-Jews? In that case, that's much akin to when Israel does something and others take it out on *all* Jews. Also, why didn't you mention the Western support for Saudi Arabia? Hmm? You're not serious. 

&gt;The government should also do more to counter attempts by foreign clerics to radicalize its Muslim community with a fundamentalist interpretation of Islam, including the insidious idea that the Holocaust is a lie. In Sweden, as in other European countries, radicalization of Muslims is often funded and organized by foreign entities.

""Foreign entities"" but you don't name any names. Why? Saudi Arabia is one. Could it be because Saudi is your ally? 

&gt;None of these efforts can be successful, however, without openly acknowledging the nature of modern anti-Semitism in Sweden.

This is coming from the same people who don't think Israel has done anything wrong. That's ridiculous. Until you're prepared for 360 degree honesty, you're not going to get anywhere.

&gt;During his state visit to Sweden in 2013, President Barack Obama didn’t hesitate to call out the country’s anti-Semitism problem. Speaking at Stockholm’s main synagogue, he included a subtle but unmistakable criticism of the attitude among Swedish politicians: ”We will stand against anti-Semitism and hatred, in all its forms.” Swedish leaders should heed his words.

Good. You can start by ending all your Middle Eastern wars, which are killing mainly semites, like the Arabs.

The process is different because you have to prove you live together long enough with a will to stay together and offer the child best possible raising, while marriage presumes some of those characteristics. You have to prove you didn't just meet on the street ten minutes ago and tried to adopt a child (same with inheritance etc).

It's more difficult because of the nature of the Family Law in Croatia (with the key principle in it being ""child's best interest""), however, with unregistered cohabitation taking more place in the social life, it could be made easier in the future.

5979,"First off, you're thinking of the ICC *(International Criminal Court)*, while I'm referencing the ICJ *(International Court of Justice)*. 

The latter is a institution of the U.N., and as such, the United States is a party to it, the former derives it's authority from a treaty, which you're right, the United States didn't ratify. 

We don't deny the ICC's jurisdiction, we simply don't consent to it. It's only authority is from a treaty we have no commitments too. In fact, if the ICC attempted to arrest a American official or serviceman over something that had to do with Iraq, without America's consent, treaty signature or a authorization of the UNSC *(where America has a veto)*, IT in itself would actually be a rouge organization openly violating international law for such a action. Not that it really matters though, as you would've never seen a American arrested for anything even if we did join, since the ICC party-states have shown they're a complete failure at policing their own even when they have a mandate.

**Second off, you didn't answer the question.**

&gt;Would they be in the wrong if they did? 
&gt;
&gt;Especially if, as with the SCS, their side's position is vindicated by The Hague &amp; they're doing it in direct support of close allies that would be massively impacted by the claim in a negative way?

Don't avoid it. Don't try to de-rail from it. That's some shill shit. 

And for the record, the ICJ needs two things to make a binding judgement:

* A international treaty signed &amp; ratified by the country accused of violating it

* Said violater to consent to the dispute being judged by the ICJ

Guess who not only signed &amp; ratified UNCLOS, but openly consented to the SCS dispute being judged by the ICJ? Fuckin' China. lol 

Why? IDK, it's fucking China. 

This is why America doesn't sign &amp; ratify so many international treaties *(like the ICC)*, and why it doesn't consent to so many judgements. Because, believe it or not, we actually do strive to keep our word, and we actually still are a Western society that values the rule of law &amp; treaty commitments. We might end up being a asshole, but we never promised to not be a asshole in the first place.

Now if you want to actually discuss the issue at hand, we can continue, but if you instead want to keep going on anti-American tirades with unrelated whataboutism bullshit, at least know the difference between the ICC &amp; ICJ, and at least know the very dynamics of the situation at hand. 

Also, if you want to talk realpolitik, here's a dose. We're fast approaching a multi-polar world wherr international alliances will likely matter much more than they did before, and America's economic *(free market-based capitalism)* &amp; political foundation *(liberal democracy)* are closer to Europe's than any other Great Power. So allowing China, a illiberal authoritarian regime with a penchant for state capitalism, to sieze the world's most trafficked shipping lane in the world's fastest growing economic region, at the expense of free market-based liberal democratic allies/proxies of America, is fucking retarded when discussing the national interests of European states, the trans-atlantic alliance which underpins the Western World &amp; the influence of Western values *(both political &amp; economic)* on globalization.
