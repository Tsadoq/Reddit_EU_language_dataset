7,"More on her:

&gt; Neus Catal√† was born on the 6th of October 1915 in a small town in the south-east of Catalonia. Anti-fascist fighter and member of the PSUC (Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia) in her youth, she was forced into exile with the fall of the Second Republic and the victory of Franco‚Äôs troops in 1939. Catal√† crossed the French border together with 200 orphan children she was in charge of at ‚ÄòLas Acacias‚Äô orphanage. Once in France, she collaborated with the republican and anti-fascist resistance in Spain until she was caught by the Nazi authorities. In 1944, she was deported to the female-only Nazi concentration camp of Ravensbr√ºck where more than 132,000 women were detained between 1939 and the end of World War II. In 1945, she was moved to Flossenb√ºrg, where she was freed by the Soviet army on 30th April 1945.  

&gt; After this experience she returned to Catalonia, where she founded ‚ÄòAmical Ravensbr√ºck‚Äô, an association which works with the constant objective of recognising the life of Neus Catal√† and by extension all those who suffered from the consequences of the Second World War and the horrors of the concentration camps.

14,"Yes, if you didn't speak up or act against the war, you condoned it. Lets not pretend wartime support wasn't at a high at the start of the war in Germany, discounting some working class protests.

For two the damage done to the French and Belgian countryside and people had to be reimbruised. Especially considering how Germany's government has the lion's share of the blame for starting the war, seeing as it was actively searching for an excuse to do so for years prior to WW 1. Not to mention the war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetuated by the German Empire and A-H.

For three, defending your declaration of a 2nd war under the defense that you never wanted the 1st war to happen is a weak, weak defense.

For four, Germans didn't protest when brest litovsk was signed.

1. Season some (partially fatty) lamb meat (ideally some kid of loin cut into 5cm chunks) with salt, pepper, and whatever spices you like.
2. Add the meat to a cast iron pot and sear at medium high heat on all sides, about 4m per side. Do not rush the first step, the browning adds a lot of flavour and it can only be done at this step. 
3. Once the meat is done, put it aside and add in a large onion diced roughly. Allow the onion to carmerlize (watch it turn brown) then add about 200mL of wine (something like Merlot works well), an equal amount of broth (chicken or beef) and throw the meat back in. 
4. Add some thyme and rosemary (to taste) and then let the stew boil. Once it boils, turn the heat down so the stew simmers for 45 minutes.
5. Cut carrots and potatoes in large chunks and throw them into the stew. Let it go for another ~40 minutes until the vegetables are semi-tender.
6. Divide the soup up and enjoy it, ideally with some good (German) bread and some hearty beer or wine. ",Europa,/r/europe/comments/9kdb2n/winter_comfort_food_recipes/e6ybize/,HugodeGroot,1538370383

156,"Because the population pool they're drawing from is similar, making it fairer. It started out as UK vs US, then Ireland and UK vs US, but it was a predictably uneven competition (given the uneven pool of players each side was drawing from for their respective teams). So, since 1979 it's been Europe vs US, which has resulted in much more even competitions.

Team Europe has only ever had players from the UK, Ireland, Spain, Sweden, Germany, Italy, Denmark, France, and Belgium. From Wiki:

&gt;In the 20 contests from 1979 to 2018 there have been 150 appearances by players from Great Britain and Ireland (an average of 7.5) and 90 by those from Continental Europe (an average of 4.5). 

The team qualification [is pretty complex](https://www.rydercup.com/news-media/europe/how-european-and-american-teams-are-picked-2018-ryder-cup), but it allows any ""European"" who meets the criteria to qualify, and says:

&gt;All decisions and/or disputes relating to a Player‚Äôs eligibility for selection for a European Ryder Cup team including any issues relating to nationality, citizenship, domicile or residency of a Player will be determined by the European Tour‚Äôs Tournament Committee, subject to the ratification of any such decision by the Ryder Cup Policy Board (as the same may subsequently be known) of Ryder Cup Europe LLP.

That presumably takes an ordinary person reading of the term ""European"". That said, golf really isn't that popular in too many countries. In theory a Russian could qualify for Team Europe, but there's just never been a good enough Russian. In reality, Team Europe is always made up of some combination of British, Irish, Scandinavian, and a few Western European Players.

As to why the rest of the world is left out? The same reason countries are left out of any sporting event I guess. This is the US vs Europe game. If people are interested in organising others, they can. Rugby has the Six Nations, for example. Why those six? History, tradition, general interest, and so on.

236,"That's a quick answer without much in-depth, but I think the question might require more effort to answer.

Your analysis begins from the premise that the goal of warfare is purely to neutralize your enemy by use of force, like killing them with guns and bombs. It needs to be considered whether this starting point is in fact correct, because if it isn't, and you begin from the wrong premise, the analysis will likely also fail. Take for example the Russia's war in Ukraine. It is often referred to be a ""hybrid-warfare"". It really consists of at least as much effort spent into shaping opinions and events, most importantly by what's commonly referred to as propaganda, than effort into conventional warfare of weapons. The conventional war side of it is only a so called low-intensity conflict. In a low-intensity conflict you don't use artillery and air power (weapons, surveillance sure), at least to their full extent. Low-intensity conflicts/hybrid wars are not won purely by weapons. There's some, often sporadic, shooting and bombing going on, and yes some thousands or tens of thousands die, but the line of battle is often frozen. Rather half of the operation goal, if not the only goal, is to subvert the enemy into your side.

Imagine having this sort of a hybrid-war. 5, 10, 50 kilometers away there's a battle-line. You put these civilians and children into a fort. You man it with some military force, a base perhaps for artillery or surveillance. Now the enemy could, of course, level it into the ground with modern artillery and air power, but to what end? What would they gain by it? If they do it, the TV- and Internet is full of dead civilians and children, you've probably lost the propaganda war in a single move.

One might also think that it's far fetched to use civilians as human shields. I really don't think so, It's what the Palestinians do, it's what the Israelis probably do, it's what the Taliban does.

The reason why the above is worth to note is that you have conceptualized warfare as a very simplified mathematical calculation, one which the only worth to note feature is neutralizing enemy by use of force. This doesn't reflect the reality of war that we have. The last war that I would describe came anywhere near it is world war 2. If you just conceptualize war into a simple mathematical calculation such as this, there's also no reason to stop the calculation into artillery and air power. Why not use guided bombs, drones. Chemical weapons. Atomic weapons. Biochemical weapons. At this level of abstraction you might as well say that forts are useless because you can weaponize smallpox and wipe out the entire human race with it, so what use is the fort.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/9k7gfc/fort_bourtange_the_netherlands/e6xygyb/,anonymisaattori,1538356018

This photo was taken during a visit to Saint Martin (a French overseas territory) after Macron had met a young man that had recently been released from prison for larceny. Macron wanted to make sure this man got himself on the right path and visited his mother's home nearby where this photo was taken. You could see the Macron lecture the man that he should make an effort for the sake of his mother and you see Macron hug the man's crying mother afterwards. It's honestly an endearing and human moment for him. But removed from all context this image is making the rounds in France being misrepresented as Macron being weak on delinquents.

Some of them (quotas in the public sector, language rights with local government, etc) are dependent on the proportion of the population they make up, whether on the national or district level.

Obviously this means that everyone is a bit scared of rocking the boat when it comes to confirming what the actual number of Albanians in the country is, so we basically just make do with figures from 2002. Also, when there was a plan to carry out a census in 2011 or so, it didn't come to fruition because no one could agree on what time of year it should be held.

556,"To be fair though, in the context of the time, P√©tain was perceived by many as the guy who ""took upon himself"" (""donn√© de sa personne"") the burdens of a defeated France. He was elected with ""full powers"" by the remaining government, and had to juggle with the Germans throughout the Occupation, trying to secure a place for France at a time when people were certain that the Axis had already won.

It's easy in hindsight to think him a coward and whatnot. He obviously wasn't an ""idiot"" (do you actually think he didn't know he was a puppet?). I don't think his role was cowardly. Of all things he was pretty brave. At worst, it was opportunistic, but given his character, a war general who was a hero of WW1, notably in its largest battle, Verdun, it can be argued that he was a strong nationalist and wasn't happy of the situation in WW2, but he figured his duty was to preserve what was left of France after its defeat. Or maybe he loved Nazism? Well, I don't think so. 

There's no arguing he was probably anti-semitic, probably racist, and favoured authoritarianism, considering Vichy's record. Or was it pressure from the Nazis? But there's a reason why De Gaulle (also probably a racist..) ""pardoned"" him from the death penalty after the Liberation. P√©tain had a lot of support. And in a court of law, one could argue that his intentions weren't treasonous or malignant. One could argue he was trying to save France, from his perspective. One could argue he was reluctant, but thought it his duty to form a government so France could take its new place in a post war world where the Nazis had won.

You'd be surprised how much people at the time didn't see him as the demon we see him today with our modern black and white hindsight. To explain where I'm coming from, let me recommend a book from French-Israeli historian Simon Epstein, ""Un Paradoxe Fran√ßais"" which I'd recommend as a great source to understand the complexity of Occupied France. The subtitle of this book is ""Antiracistes dans la Collaboration, antis√©mites dans la R√©sistance"". Perhaps you can grasp from this subtitle how complex the situation actually was. Students in history know already that people's motivations are complex, and anyway, this is a great, albeit provocative book to understand how historians debate these complexities of the human spirit, and how history can't be analyzed in a Manichean way. 

Now while some Vichy apologists point out that French Jews were less exterminated in France than in most other occupied countries, I'm not claiming that the Vichy government wasn't antisemitic and murderous. Many Jews were deported by the Vichy regime acting on its own accord... presumably. Surely, that French Jews had a lower death toll than other countries isn't due to the fact that Vichy wasn't antisemitic. Vichy was totally antisemitic. No arguing about that.

Fuck it, what was my point? Oh yeah, P√©tain wasn't a ""massive idiot"" :p

He was more of an over-achiever, but got in the wrong side of history. Actual idiots don't understand the complexity of his long life and motivations. I think it silly how we teach history to students today. The ""roman national"" is ridiculous throughout, and it's sometimes right-wing (for figures like Vercingetorix, Clovis, Charlemagne, Louis XIV), sometimes left-wing (pro-Revolution, anti-Vichy...). The way we teach our history in school is just too basic and simple. ",France,/r/europe/comments/9k54jt/notre_m√®re_leurope_vichy_france_1942/e6x89i2/,MartelFirst,1538333339

Update: As of 18:30 (with another 30 minutes left to vote), 34.59% have cast ballots.

Update 2: PM Zaev says that ""the Macedonian people have shown that they want to be part of the European family,"" says that the decision of the referendum is final, praises the peaceful democratic process, and says it paves the way for a European Macedonia. Final results are not in yet, but it seems like they'll pursue Constitutional amendments despite the fact that the 50% threshold for the referendum wasn't reached and expect that the majority of the votes were supportive of the agreement with Greece.

Update 3: The final turnout numbers are **still** unannounced as of 20:30. Votes are already being counted, with an overwhelming majority of 90% voting in favor of the agreement. Both the PM and the leader of the opposition are calling for elections, maybe as early as December. There are reports that Tsipras has told Zaev ""I can wait for you till April.""

(Final) Update 4: PM Zaev believes that although the referendum failed, it sends a clear message that Macedonians see Europe as the future. He'll try to get the opposition to vote with him on the Constitutional amendments, giving them about 10 days to make up their mind. Otherwise, we're headed for elections in late November. As for the results, with 95% of the votes counted, 91.4% (or 570.000 voters) support the agreement. That's all from me folks.

Besides Hitler was fully aware that a two front war would mean death for Germany and would have probably accept the loss of many territories. Also soon after the Poland invasion the German victory was so overwhelming that they start to transfer troops to the west against such eventuality, the window to act for France was really short in 1939.

i didnt say that i approve of this situation. i very much think Israel should stop crying about the holocaust every time someone criticises them.

i couldnt care less if the soldier firing a missile into someones window is jewish, muslim, christian or buddhist. criticising israel in how it behaves with arabs is ""anti-oppression"", more than ""anti-semitic""

Cool, I guess whoever wrote this article is fine with having 100% clean nuclear waste dumped in their garage when the nuclear power plants are decommissioned at the end of their life cycle.

That is very hard to estimate, since nuclear has substantial additional costs that are payed for through taxes (subsidies, security, decommissioning), and both nuclear and fossil fuels have substantial additional environmental costs (climate change for fossil fuels, the occasional Chernobyl or Fukushima for nuclear). Comparing only the consumer prices is highly misleading.

1206,I'm never a fan of wars. I believe as Europeans we should be civilized and dispute diplomatically. The IRA wanted an independent republic that was strictly Irish. They did this by means of violence which as I said I dont condone. Kosovo wants to be an independent republic also. Albanians and Serbians lived in Kosovo for many year in harmony. I'm from Peja. (Pec)from the Mountains of Rugove which borders Montenegro. We have friends from all over. Hopefully it will get resolved diplomatically and no more innocent lives will be lost. There needs to be a better way to deal with the Issues between Serbia and Kosovo.  The hatred needs to fade and we need to move on. The UcK will always be there hiding and waiting.  I believe they would be a guerilla warfare type of movement. Albanians will never leave Kosovo as they have been there for centuries and they will never bow down to another republic. Politics will always force hatred between human beings. I would never hate someone of what their ancestors did. I will never judge someone without getting to know them. What happend in the 90's in the Balkans should of never happen but it did.  The UcK was kosovos from of army trying to fight serb aggression towards Albanians. Both sides did some fucked up shit.

1225,"The Germans never accepted a secondary role in Bohemia and Moravia, and never would themselves to be governed by Czechs. This killed any idea of Czechoslovakian statehood, where TGM envisioned the country to be nation-region state of Bohemia and Moravia based on historic ties. The Germans refused to share that vision, and Czechs position was not making the things easier. Slovakia was a bit different, because it was respected during land-administrative reforms and got a certain degree of autonomy in 1928 onward. The unitary state was created again in 1945 and lasted till 1968 and Slovaks had a lesser autonomy during the 1st 20 years of communism than during the I. republic. Novotny totally disliked Slovaks, and even cancelled their cultural autonomy in 1960. It was not uncommon when he was insulting Slovaks in the public.

However, the German and Czech antagonism occurred in 1848, not in 1918. Both nations grew apart and could not coexist. The Germans were so successful against any Czech autonomy or political development that they even prevented Franz Joseph Walker to ever get crowned as a Bohemian king. This was considered an insult for a population that provided after Germans more tax money to Vienna. Czechs also carried the biggest cost of the WWI in the term of man loss among A-H monarchy. The Czechoslovak government in 1920 estimated that 480,000 Czechs and Slovak men died during WWI, far more than was the share of their population in the monarchy. This was also a reason why there was a such strong resentment against Germans. Consider that Czechoslovak population loses during WWII were 345,000, WWI was far graver in the term of the human life.",,/r/europe/comments/9jl4en/austriahungary_ethnicity_before_wwi/e6w7en7/,kaik1914,1538284337

1237,"During the monarchy, there was a certain degree of cooperation among Czechs and Germans when they shared a common goal(s). German liberals depended on Czech liberals to push through their agenda (with whom else). Social Democrats supported each other in the terms of social justice and equal voting (a similar share of the proletariat). This cooperation ended during WWI and Germans were so much in shock with the lose of the supremacy that any former cooperation was gone. Masarik as a person who grew up in the second half of the 19th century, expected that the cooperation on issues like democracy, social justice (8 hour day was established in December 1918 in Czechoslovakia), secular humanism, etc..., would continue in the new republic without the need of the imperial administration; but such steps were hindered by Germans. When a Depression hit Central Europe, unemployed Czechs or Germans did not had any common language, yet both parties suffered from the economic collapse. Germans put the Czechoslovak administration to the same position as did Czechs in 1870s and refused to participate in the country affairs without gaining any benefits from it. Czechoslovak government did not force Germans to participate, it was their choice, and Czechs took an advantage from the vacuum.",,/r/europe/comments/9jl4en/austriahungary_ethnicity_before_wwi/e6w81t0/,kaik1914,1538285236

There was only exception in the chemical industry concentrated in northern and northeastern Bohemia, and was in a German hands. Which was the biggest, richest, and wealthiest conglomerate in Czechoslovakia? It was Bata in Zlin. Zlin was the wealthiest city in 1938 Czechoslovakia. Skoda in Pilsen, CKD in Praha, Zbrojovka Brno, Poldi and Vitkovice steelworks were all outside Sudetenland. Almost all heavy industries were in Bohemian and Moravian heartland from Pilsen via Beroun to Prague to Pardubice, and again around Ostrava and Brno. Sudetenland had textile, pulp, wood, wool, glass, and consumer goods industries that got hammered by the depression. Plus mountains made harsher for agriculture, while Polabi, Hana, Moravian vales offered a food for relatives who were unemployed. People suffered less there than in the mountains. 

The Czechoslovak government was not making the situation for Germans easier. Germans refusal to participate in the government got them excluded to fix the economic situation. Subsequently, the Germans did not want to learn bit Czechs to work in the Czechoslovak administration and complained that they could not get a stable government job where basic Czech communication was required. It was not win-win situation. If both parties would see the other as an equal party and fellow human sharing the same land and history, they would learn the other party position and language, but this failed with a fault on both parties.

so much for small minority. and you can't compare a life as a student to a life on hartz4, as one of the most daunting experiences for a lot of people that are within the hartz4 bracket for over a year is social exclusion, something you don't have to worry about in your time as student.

&gt;Did they own two cars, did they go on holiday, how often did they eat  foreign food, meat or luxury goods? What is their life expectancy like?

that's exactly what i ment when i told you are living in a bubble. a vast part of the population don't own two cars, they are lucky if they have barely functioning one, can't afford holidays or expensive foods and luxury goods. and i mean that's great for you that don't have to worry about these things, but you are seem to be very disconnected from the reality of life for a lot of german people. but hey, they have access to the internet, so all is fine ye?

&gt;All that aside, there is no answer to automation in a Social Democratic  program, because companies don't even need to confront workers to  replace them with machines. A trade union cannot stop climate change,  and nationalisation in a global economy is a futile effort. That's why  those parties need an entirely new program instead of glorifying the  past.

you seem somewhat hung up on the idea that the spd or a social democratic agenda equals trade unions. the big question for the spd in terms of automation is not how to keep people employed, but how to cope with the reality that near full employment isn't a sustainable model in the future. so things like ubi or a preemptive restructuring of the education system, or if we leave out automation and focus on now, the housing market, would be staples of a proper social democratic agenda. and i grant you the spd has done a piss poor job of doing exactly that, which is why their numbers are ever plummenting. but that being said, you are aware that the spd has been on the forefront together with the greens to fight climate change within germany, are you?

1305,"&gt;To say that ""Die Linke"" is not a threat to the established economic system is pretty big talk. You might agree with their criticisms, but they fundamentally want to overturn pretty much everything, if given the chance. They are by all accounts a radical party, too.

Name three radical economic demands of The Left on the federal please? What have they overturned on a state level in the areas where they're in power? On a federal level, as much as I disagree with them on a lot of major points, they've been an absolutely amazing opposition party.

Putting an established and - on a federal level - constructive opposition party on the same level as a party that openly flirts with neo-Nazis, is obstructionist wherever possible and embraces any lunatic conspiracy theory is a pretty interesting choice to say the least.

&gt;The latter would probably govern like an 80s CDU/CSU government

Yes, including trying to get rid of same-sex marriage, removing funds from anti-neo-Nazi groups, denying climate change and being openly against people that aren't ""German enough"" for them.

Could you remind me when the CDU/CSU leadership told people to boycott Turkish stores again in the 80s? When did they ask people to be proud of the accomplishments of the Wehrmacht?

&gt;Rs and Ds are roughly 50/50 of the US population, and have been ever since WW2, with no larger moves than a few percentage points, for the most part. Meanwhile, Germany is seeing these shifts towards smaller parties.

Precisely. The fact that extremely few Rs would consider voting D and the other way around is a sign of an entrenched system *without much consensus*.

The fact that CSU voters aren't afraid to move to Greens or FW is a sign of a flexible system *with much consensus across the political spectrum*.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/9jy63g/for_the_first_time_in_germany_the_green_party_is/e6w0gv5/,rEvolutionTU,1538276150

&gt; but you are seem to be very disconnected from the reality of life for a lot of german people. 

I mean I am German and I have worked in Germany and paid taxes in Germany so I'm pretty sure I'm just as real as anyone else. Do you think this tactic of claiming that everyone who disagrees with you lives in a bubble is a strategy that's going to get you any further?

All of that being said, burning down a building that slaughters animals does not entail that the individuals doing it care for people less than animals. That fire killed and harmed no humans, but will lead to suffering for ~60 humans whose jobs will be lost or in danger of being lost. The average slaughterhouse in Europe processes about 200 animals an hour. So you could really value human life quite highly, and value animal life at only a very small fraction of that (say, .0001%), and still see this as a huge net gain in terms of reducing net human and non-human animal suffering.

What do you mean with ""top""? I can't find a single list of top arms exporters you are top on, you simply arent nearly big enough. Even in total arms sale Sweden is number 11 while you arent even top 20.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry

Are you twelve, or is it that difficult for you to find information online? One quick google search, and I found sources backing up what I said.


&gt; We have IKEA, HM, aztra zenaca, Ericsson, assa abloy, axo nobel, Volvo, Scania, Skanska, electrolux, SCA, SAAB, ABB, atlas copco, storaenso, securities all dominate their markets, besides oil what massive corporations do you have that can bring in foreign capital and compete globally? What do you have to fall back on? Show me some examples of Norweigans being able to compete with the rest.


Equinor is bigger than any Swedish company. Petroleum is not Equinor's most important sector anymore either, which is why it changed its name from Statoil to Equinor - to distance itself from the petroleum sector. For example, Equinor's totall assets is worth 120 billion USD, about twice as much as IKEA's 67 billion. Then you also have YARA, DNB, Telenor, Norsk Hydro, Kongsberg Gruppen are all bigger than a lot of those you mentioned. Equinor dwarfing all of them. 


&gt;  And dont you think that massive fleet is connected to your oil?

We had one of the largest fleets in the world prior to finding oil.

One more thing; you act as the technological advancement made in the petroleum sector only applies there, which is very, very wrong. Norwegian petroleum technology is used world wide now in the maritime sector for example. A quick example; You see the charging cables for modern electric vehicles? Surprise surprise, that is a direct result of tech transfer(insulated transformers) from the petroleum sector, as it was originally created for deep sea drilling. There are dozens of more examples. https://www.norskpetroleum.no/en/environment-and-technology/petroleum-related-research-and-development/

Norway is becoming less and less dependent on oil, while also becoming increasingly richer. A prime example is that the Norwegian oil production has been declining since 2000, where it reached its peak. It's not like it's a small decline either; oil production in 2018 is half of what it was in 2000. Despite a decline in oil production, Norway's GDP just continues to soar.

1385,"&gt; Being fine with same-sex marriage, being fine with abortion or not being hardcore nationalists are mainstream German positions.

Yes, because Germany moved ""to the left"" on those. 

&gt;Abortion hasn't been a topic for decades, 75% of Germans are in favor of same-sex marriage. You can't just paint a, for example, American or Polish conservative stance and pretend that's somehow true conservatism.

You're totally making my point, again. German conservatism moved to the center by giant leaps. Similarily, I could tell you that the majority of Germans doesn't support radical economic leftwing positions that might be popular in Greece or Spain (think about pensions, worker protection, etc.). And that explains why the SPD doesn't support these things. Because ""you can't compare what's 'left' in Germany, with what's 'left' in Spain.""

&gt;Apart from that calling the FDP ""historically large"" is also just a tad untrue. They've usually been around 10% for most of their history with one highs around ~15% ten years ago. And no, the FDP isn't ""anti-large government"" like the GOP in the US either.

The post was long enough without picking that apart. Either way, the FDP absolutely is a liberal party opposed to a large state, in principle. How that compares to the GOP is a complicated matter (both the GOP as well as the FDP have different camps within them, and on top of that you'd have to distinguish German federal politics from US federal politics, where the states take on a much larger role, and thus many Republicans are opposed to certain measures only on federalist grounds).

&gt;All in all we have a rather large window of consensus with a party like the AfD trying to gobble up all the climate change deniers, anti-abortionists, nationalists and worse wherever they can.

If there were such a large consensus, the ""Volksparteien"" wouldn't be shrinking every election. There *is* a large consensus, which is why GroKos keep in power, but this time will presumably be the last time in history this has been possible. The next election could result in a completely impossible electoral result (such as in Sweden), as voters more and more separate themselves along ideological differences into smaller parties more to their liking.",,/r/europe/comments/9jy63g/for_the_first_time_in_germany_the_green_party_is/e6vtczd/,d4n4n,1538268374

1411,"it's bad because noone is really gaining anything from the economic politics of our country but the state itself.

the average german's living standards are not as good as you would expect for a country that is doing as well as ours. we're essentially practicing wage dumping on a massive scale. it's not benefiting the citizen at all. theres a lack of affordable living space, our healthcare system is in shambles due to understaffing thanks to the wage dumping, our school system is failing on a fudemental level as it can't be argued anymore that there isn't a clear divide for the students education level based on socioeconomic status, which goes against our constitution and the divide between the rich and the poor becomes bigger every day. we barely have a traditional middleclass left, which used to be the heartbeat of the german economy. and don't even get me started on the state of our defense forces. 

all of that is enabling a dangerous rise of the far right and undermines the strenght of the german democracy. i've seen a recent study that cited that amongst the german people born after 1990, only 30% value the fact that we're living in a democracy. down from 70% from people born after ww2.

and it is also hurting our neighbours and european partners because they can't compete with the wage dumping we practice. and long term we need a strong and probably more centralized european union to compete with the rise of china and india, but that can't be achieved if we act like we are the only country that matters within the union.",,/r/europe/comments/9jy63g/for_the_first_time_in_germany_the_green_party_is/e6vu68i/,joergboehme,1538269234

1415,"&gt; Yes, because Germany moved ""to the left"" on those. 

As a nation, not specific parties as you suggest. It's a bit like saying that the US moved to the left when they abolished slavery. True, but also something the entire population should be happy about at some point. 

When it comes to making society more egalitarian (e.g. discrimination of minorities or same-sex marriage) then 'moving to the left' is the norm, not the exception.

&gt;How that compares to the GOP is a complicated matter

No, it's really not, because there's no comparison. You can't compare the FDP to a party that is against universal healthcare, against abortions, against same-sex marriage.

&gt;If there were such a large consensus, the ""Volksparteien"" wouldn't be shrinking every election.

That large consensus allows me, as a random German citizen, to be fine with 85% of what other citizens are voting for. Our political climate and fundamental values won't be endangered if any of our parties, except the AfD, are in power tomorrow.

The FDP doesn't deny climate change, CDU/CSU don't want to get rid of universal healthcare, The Left doesn't want to dissolve our military or lengthen the time during which abortions are allowed.

That's a large consensus across the political spectrum. Analogue what's happening in Bavaria right now: People are completely comfortable swapping to Greens or other parties because they're disliking the stuff the CSU pulls lately.

Imagine Democrats or Republicans in the US shifting by 20% points to the other party because of the rhetoric their favorite used over the last half year.

Just one in six believe that concessions would be likely to lead to greater accommodation

1465,"&gt;This is untrue. The SPD is breaking apart because their core electorate doesn't exist any more

their core electorate still very much exists. just look at the poll numbers for [february - march last year](https://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/forsa.htm) , the spd came within 2% of the cdu and together with the left they had 40%. that was on the back of announcing martin schulz als chancellor candidate who many had hoped at the time would push for a more social and europa centric party programm, as he was a relative unknown to the german electorate. but the numbers quickly plummeted again once it became more clear that he would continue with the policies of the more right leaning wing of the spd.

if you follow the poll numbers through, the spd had a minor rise straight after the election after martin schulz made a stance of not going into the big coalition with the cdu again and ever since going back on that promise, the spd keeps losing more and more ground, particulary since the new faces in charge of the spd are neither competent, charismatic nor focussed on social issues at all.

so now the traditional spd electorate are either not voting at all, moving to the greens cause their leadership at least shows some resembles of a spine from time to time or worse, go straight over to the afd as they at least offer the story that all the worries of the populus is essentially down to migrants.

&gt;You don't win elections in Germany by running campaigns on economic  justice, as inequality or unemployment are largely subdued problems.

for the first point, i already gave you the polls from the election year that clearly paint a different picture. but that you argue that inequality or unemployed are ""largely subdued problems"" is a bit shocking to me. i'd really like to live in your bubble. the inequality within germany is bigger then ever. i've recently seen an analogy used that quite sat with me:

imagine a typical din-a4 paper and draw a coordination system on it where 1 cm in height equals 50.000‚Ç¨ in economic wealth owned. can be your money, your car, your house, anything really. on that scale, you can fit 95% of the german people within this one sheet of paper. you pretty much stay within the 1cm for the first 70% of people and then it slowly but exponentially grows and shoots up. if you then take the richest man in germany on this scale, he would sit in a balloon 6,6 km above the rest.

and for unemployment, it is solved on a statistical level, but not on a real level. the idea of employment is that people can live a decent live of their earnings. that is no longer the case. a lot of lower end jobs that used to be 1 job are now split into 2 or 3 seperate part time jobs that instead of paying 1 full salary, instead pay 400‚Ç¨. of those 400‚Ç¨ however, 300 are deducted by the state and you instead live on hartz4 (social security) +100. and if you're ever been in the situation where you had to live off of hartz4, you would know that is like. the ammount of money paid out to you is aptly named minimum income needed to exsist, or if you want a british term, breadline. the additional 100‚Ç¨ you get for your work are really just a drop in the bucket on that scale. and it's not like you can opt out of these systems, as failing to take one of these 400‚Ç¨ jobs offered to you, no matter your education level, will have you end up having your hartz4 cut down to 70%. yes, 70% of the money that is deemed the minimum to live a life in germany. and if none of these jobs are available, you'll get send on mandatory bogus programms like multi-months long resume training that you can't opt out either, just so you don't show up on the unemployment statistics. worst case is when you get unemployed in higher age, you risk ending up on accommodation for people in age, which removes you from the job market but also fucks up your pension you worked your entire life for.

but even if you're not stuck in this rut, we practice such an extreme form of wage dumping, that even the majority of skilled labour isn't paid particulary well. e.g. as a civil engineer, you can end up on 1900-2000‚Ç¨ netto, as a nurse, 1300-1400‚Ç¨ netto. combine that with the ever increasing cost of living space and there is really no money left for you to ever work your way upwards. you know my parents generation could sustain itself from a simple single income, could buy a house and have children. try that nowadays on a single income in the majority of jobs. and it's not like we would have to live this way as a society, but we do it because its benefitial to our countries budget and allows us to push out other european countries out of the eu market. ever asked yourself why we have such a high trade surplus with basicly any country? it's because we pay the wages of a country developing within the eu zone, but provide the know how and education levels of a leading country.

and on top of it we also haven't even attempted to tackle the challenges of further automatisation and technological advances that will keep making more and more jobs redudant over time.

we're heading straight into a socialpolitic disaster and you come to the conclusion that all is well. its really just baffling to me",,/r/europe/comments/9jy63g/for_the_first_time_in_germany_the_green_party_is/e6vwr4c/,joergboehme,1538272091

1467,"I mean, it depends...

Liberals used to be left-wing, when the right-left lingo was first adopted. Then, liberals were anti-monarchist reformers, seated on the left side of the French parliament, conservative traditionalists were seated on the right.

But that ""progress"" vs. ""conservativism"" dichotomy really becomes useless quickly. You see that in those ""The Nazis were actually left-wing"" clusterfuck discussions. They were certainly ""reformers"" and radicals. And they certainly considered themselves ""progressives."" But they were also authoritarian, and not fundamentally opposed to - at least *de jure* - private property either, which the self-described left sees as fundamentally right-wing. Meanwhile, they want to cleanse themselves from having Stalin in their camp (for similar reasons), despite running the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and communist party.

At the end of the day, these are all just semantic problems. There's no logical linear progression from being a dedicated anarcho-communist (on the ""far left""), towards a libertarian (in the center? or center-right?), towards a neo-nazi (on the ""far right"").

- Was important in the Communist Party before ww2, while it maintained a Comintern stance that the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (the only country in the world that didn't recognize USSR for the first 20 years of USSR's existence) is an unnatural Greater Serbia project which should be broken into pieces, and yet later he becomes the President of Yugoslavia, when his bosses Stalin and Churchill say Yugoslavia is OK

- Was a Stalin supporter before ww2; he is the only high ranking Yugoslav communist party official not to end up in a Soviet gulag and dead in the 1930s. Many reports testify to Tito being a snitch 

- Oversaw the genocide against ethnic Germans in Yugoslavia in 1945

- Committed innumerable crimes against his opposition 1944-1947. He killed (not personally ofc) thousands of Serb intellectuals, business owners, factory owners, even the great elderly Vojvoda (Field Marshal) of the heroic royal Serbian army in ww1, vojvoda Bojovic, who was dragged out of his home and beaten to death. Similar things happened in Croatia and Slovenia and elsewhere. They nationalized and confiscated private property throughout the country.

- Sent his own heroic partisan fighters to Goli Otok (and other oppositioners), a terrible torture island where they spent years in hard labor, tortures and interrogations. They fought heroically throughout the war against the Nazis, only to be jailed when they said Tito was wrong and isn't directing the country towards true communism, which was correct. 

- Destroyed the economy of the country by the reforms of the 1972-75 (thousands of educated company and factory CEOs and managers fired and replaced with Communist party personel), forever securing the economic catastrophe of the mid and late 80s, which was the main cause for nationalism to rise and in the end, for the war to start. From 1974 until his death in 1980 the debt grew immensely.

- You could not advance in your career if you were not a member of the one and only Party. You had no other Party. No choice... Incompetent people held many positions and their competence was that they were ""good communists"". (I'm not saying this was always the case, obviously).

All in all, I could write 10 points just like this, but about the positive things he did. However, the fact he performed the above outlined negative things and never repented, never said he was sorry or wrong, are for me enough to discredit him forever.

1554,"&gt; Has Poland ever been liberal ?

Briefly in the '90s, there were signs that it _might_ be going the right way but unfortunately the Roman Catholic Church - which in itself is very conservative in its nature - is so deeply entrenched in the politics of the country, that the country remains hugely conservative and right wing. It's a sad story overall, because people who live there just don't know any better and don't even have much of a reference point. To many, the main source of news of anything outside the Polish cultural circle (that also includes immigrants) is just TV reports and newspapers, which _always_ push an agenda, one way or another.

Many people don't travel this much, if they do it's to Egypt or somewhere like that for one-week low-cost holiday, they have never lived abroad (even in another European country, let alone elsewhere in the world), so they have no reference points, and they just keep on lapping up the BS propaganda served by whatever TV/radio/press they follow and then keep on spouting it further online and in 1:1 discussions‚Ä¶",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/9jv4l0/lech_walesa_polands_current_leaders_are_either/e6vn18k/,TheRealDynamitri,1538261701

1581,"&gt;But the injuries the archaeologists found‚Äîboth those that had healed and those inflicted at death‚Äîare shockingly numerous and gruesome.  

&gt;At some point in his life, Skeleton 1 fractured his collarbone, ribs, left wrist, kneecap, hip, lumbar spine, nose, and right middle toes.  

&gt;Skeleton 2 appears to have taken an arrow to the back, with a penetrating fracture in his left shoulder blade, and had injured both knees.  

&gt;Surprisingly, Skeleton 3 was unscathed, but possibly because he was a bit younger than the other two men.


&gt;Two dozen more injuries were found on the three bodies, but these were inflicted around the time of death. While Skeletons 1 and 3 had just a few injuries, Skeleton 2 suffered 18 wounds before he died. Most of the wounds were inflicted on these men‚Äôs heads by an attack from the front, and most injuries were caused by sharp objects like swords and arrows.

&gt;There was a musket ball lodged in the neck vertebrae of Skeleton 2, in addition to an arrowhead still stuck in a rib, a hacking wound that shattered the facial skeleton, and indication on the vertebrae that someone attempted to behead him.

&gt;Skeleton 3 also showed evidence of beheading with a blade wound‚Äîpossibly from a broadsword‚Äîthrough a neck vertebra. Skeleton 1 suffered a massive cranial fracture, likely caused by a mace. Since soldiers at that time could only physically carry and use a musket, a bow, or a mace, and not a combination of those, this means that at least three different individuals set upon this group of men.


&gt;Mihai Constantinescu and colleagues carefully disentangled the jumbled remains and pored over the bones looking for clues about who they were and how they died.  Writing in the International Journal of Osteoarchaeology, they note that all three skeletons were male, and young to middle-age adults.  The men all had poor dental health as well as early evidence of osteoarthritis throughout their bodies. Based on muscle attachment sites on bone, they were also engaging in similar repetitive activities: lifting, throwing, moving heavy objects, walking long distances, and sitting in a crouched position.  It is highly likely these men shared an occupation that required them to perform the same activities over and over again.

It's a very complicated subject. The current state of Russia is a chain of unfortunate events.

1. Gorbachev Started Glastnost that allowed criticism of Communist Party, that's where a lot of later prominent politicians will come from. Yeltsin was one of them.

2) Gorbachev decided to make USSR more liberal and reforge it into something like EU, but from soviet states. De facto starting dissolution process.

3) Couple of morons in Communist government decided that Gorbachev destroying their country and behind his back staged coup to prevent liberalization process. This event became August Putch. They failed as Yeltsin taking opportunity became defacto head of ressistence against them.

4) Obviously that undermined faith in communist party and Gorbachev. Which led to Gorbachev loss in first free elections.

5) Yeltsin became President, Western Governments quickly abandoned Gorbachev in favor of Yeltsin and started variously support him and use him.

6) At first Yeltsin was popular, but later came 90s, economical crisis, raise of bandtism, Chechen War and other various problems. All this time instead of tending to people he pretty much straggled for holding to power.

7) Obviously people became disappointed with new government and Yeltsin, so they came back to the only power that could rival him - communist party.

8) The idea of communists coming back didn't sit well with western governments specially US, which led them to support Yeltsin and pretty much allowed him to cheat during elections. US promised to pressure IMF to lend credit to Russia to pay off pensions and social benefits, but ofcourse not for free. Instead we were asked to forfeit our veto against Yugoslavia bombing.

9) Yeltsin won second elections with fraud, as results were never disclosed afterwards. During his campaign his only opponent had 1 mil $ , while Yeltsin had about 750 mil$. Both TV channels that existed back then were controlled by oligarchs and dirtinied Zuganov as much as they could. He was even evicted from hotel after coming back from rally.

10) That damaged perception of democracy in Russia. No one believes in it anymore. Obviously dissatisfaction with Yeltsin haven't gone away.

11) Bombing of Yugoslavia created a conflict between Yeltsin and Western powers so he become disappointed in ""smart guys"" that believed that best option is allign to West and started looking for the ""strong guy"".

12) At the same time other prominent politicians started their rise. One of them was Anatoly Sobchak, whose secretary was Putin.

13) Then in Chechnya came nationalists.  One of them, Dudaev, became powerful enough to persuade people to obtain independency from Russia and started instigating anti-russian sentiment in region, which drove off russian population as they were attacked and threatened. That led to downfall of any possibility of independence of region as normal functioning country as majority of population were agriculture based shepherds and russians were industrial educated one. Basicly Chechnya would've become second Afghanistan.

14) Obviously Yeltsin and Co ignored him until it became too late. We got First Chechen War. It was unpopular, it was rushed by retards in government and it was bad for the both sides. Dudaev was widely supported by both Western powers as they considered him to be freedom figther and by Saudi's as he was fellow muslim.

15) Chechens defacto won war at the same time losing western support as they commited terrorist acts. Dudaev dies. Chechnya becomes torn region hold by various warlords. They don't want to be united and they starting their shit on the borders with Russia - various kidnaping for money, raids, theft, etc.

16) All of this pressures Yeltsin to pick new prime minister as he becomes unpopular, have a political crisis with communist party holding parlamient (that at that time working properly) and on the tiny straw of being impeachment and prosecuted.

17) He have two candidates: Nemtsov, which is considered ""smart guy"" and Putin, which is considered ""strong guy"". He picks the later one.

18) Putin who was at that time FSB head wasn't very public person, so his PR team started molding him into ""cool guy"". He assumed role easily and became quite popular.

19) At the same time liberals in government either started leaving or were converting into Yeltsin elites. Putin started filling gaps with his fellow comrades from St.Petersburg Mayor Office. All of the current government are Putin's colleagues that served under Anatoly Sobchak. All of them.

20) Yeltsin get a heart attack, so he give up power. Making Putin de facto president. Presidental elections coming.

21) Putin aren't that popular candidate for president. He have two strong opponents Yuri Lujkov - Mayor of Moscow and Yevgeny Primakov - ex prime minister of Russia. Putin gets back up from Oligarch Berezovsky that starting campaign to dirty both candidates with his owned tv channel  **Public Russian Television.**

22) Their rating plunder. Putin's rise. He easily win elections.

23) Putin cames to power and continues to play ""strong guy"", starting war on oligarchs. Driving from Russia Gusinsky and Berezovsky and taking under control state channels. Starting Yukos case with Khodorkovsky to force other Oligarchs to start pay taxes. All of that lead to support from other Oligarchs, because Oligarchs now de facto united, paying taxes and salaries - crime rates starting to drop. Putin gains even more popularity.

24) Then Chechens cross Dagestan borders and de facto give Casus Belli for Putin to start second campaign as it violates treaties of first peace deal. Additionally House bombings in Volgograd happens. The case is shaddy, but no international journalists found case to have sufficient evidence to be a inside job. Second campaign starts.

25) Second war was more brutal and ended in victory of federal forces. Also we had some of the worst terracts - Beslan and Nord Ost.

26) Putin became really popular with the end of War.

Everything that happens later not so interesting. The only interesting moment was when Medvedev gave power back to Putin, as Putin's government became paranoidal of indepence of Medvedev and persuaded Putin that he trying to sack him off and Putin being disappointed in weakness in international affairs of Medvedev.",Russia,/r/europe/comments/9jv4l0/lech_walesa_polands_current_leaders_are_either/e6vf8ry/,Ehrl_Broeck,1538254074

1613,"&gt;Unrelated men and women is not the only condition.

Okay, unmarried unrelated adult men and women.

&gt;People marry unrelated men and women of the opposite sex, who have reached a certain age and are not already married.

But if the question is should same sex marriage be allowed, you cannot argue against it by referring to the law which bans same sex marriage. It's like saying ""cannabis cannot be legalized because it's illegal"". It's a circular argument.

&gt;So if you want ""of the opposite sex"" removed, on what basis are the others kept? Why not accept polygamy, incest and marriage with minors too?

First of all, I was pointing out that the subjects who are married are identical in same sex marriage and in opposite sex marriage. They are unmarried unrelated adult men and women. 

If you equate same sex marriage to the moral question of incest and marriage with minors, then you should accept opposite sex marriage is of equal moral questionability, because the subjects in opposite sex marriage also are unmarried unrelated adult men and women. Same sex marriage doesn't bring any ""new meat"" to the table. If a man marrying an unmarried unrelated adult male is comparable to incestuous or child marriage, then a woman marrying an unmarried unrelated adult male is comparable to incestuous or child marriage too, *because she is marrying the same kind of subject*.

Secondly, monogamous same sex marriage has identical consequences when it comes to  legal rights and responsibilities for the partners as an opposite sex marriage, so the legal issues which arise from polygamous marriage do not concern monogamous same sex marriage.

That is why allowing same sex marriage doesn't automatically mean you should allow polygamous, incestuous or child marriages and the features of those marriages are a separate question with their own dilemmas, independent of same sex marriage.

Personally, I'd allow polygamous marriages, as long as the legal obligations and rights between multiple partners are properly planned. This is not an issue in same sex marriage, so that is why allowing same sex marriage does not automatically open doors for polygamous marriages.

I'd also allow incestuous marriages, when the other partner hasn't been an authority to the other (so a parent cannot groom a child) and care is taken to avoid having disabled children. These things are not an issue in same sex marriage, so that is why allowing same sex marriage doesn't automatically open the door for incestuous marriages.

I would not allow marriages with minors, because minors are not able to make full responsible decisions concerning long time plans. This thing is not an issue in same sex marriage, so this is why allowing same sex marriage doesn't automatically open the door for child marriage.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/9jycpw/recognition_of_samesex_marriage_in_europe/e6vfenv/,Toby_Forrester,1538254227

It is true that I have quite bad opinion about the general population, but I don't really enjoy it.

1667,"Nice, detailed answer. It all goes down to the moral questionability you mentioned I guess. In the eyes of most people here same sex marriage is as bad as incestious or polygamous marriage, that's why I steered the discussion that way probably.

A few months ago the government tried to ratify a convention about domestic violence and such things, but it mentioned a ""third gender"" or something similar somewhere. People decided it opens the pandora box of multiple genders and gay marriage and the backlash was brutal. They didn't ratify it.

is pretty retarded. 

Cuba failed? What? Cuba has performed outstandingly all things considered. Vastly improved  from before the revolution, vastly outperforms similar nations, even doing better than the US in some metrics. All while being a tiny, resource poor island under blockade and constant Cia attack. *some* Cubans hate castro, mainly the wealthy ones affiliated with the previous dictatorial regime, the ones who fled.


&gt;pre-stalin Russia failed and then decided to kill milions and enslave even more and then also fail.

Total bullshit, provide sources. 

&gt;Spain didn't last even 5 years I think and also killed a bunch of people 

Yeah they killed the fascists fighting for Franco. Good riddance, wish they killed more. 

Its not as if capitalism doesn't fail constantly in far more preferential circumstances than any communist nation has ever failed in. Capitalism took many bloody revolutions and failures to get a foothold, so cool your bullshit. 

Capitalist will always defend themselves by pointing at past failures of others, forgetting their own sabotaging hand, their own past filled with failures, their own horrendous list of unjust deaths. And  will always avoid debating the ideas and concepts themselves.

1696,"&gt;There is nothing veiled, I'm quite open about what I expect is gonna happen.

How far did expectations get your leaders in the 90s?

&gt;The terrorists in Kosovo are never going to be able to resist Serbia on their own, so really, time is on our side here.

Is that so? Serbia shrinks with passing time. Who is gonna fight your fantasy war in a country where the average age is pushing 43 at this point in time today? Will it be pensioners? How will Serbia conduct such an operation when its military is rated lower than some failed African states like the Sudan, and its economy is very fragile? How will ordinary Serbs react to risking their lives over your Hearts of Iron fantasy wargame, when today, the vast majority of Serbs said they won't risk a war over Kosovo? 

People who are living paycheck to paycheck in the most impoverished region of Europe will suddenly go up in arms in a war which will result in another '90s scenario because 9A4172 told them to? And Albanians with similar living conditions yet the threat of defensive war will just lie there and do nothing lol? Are you aware of how bad Yugoslav troop morale was in Kosovo on the ground during the war, how would it be like today? Furthermore, are you telling me Serbs, which will number somewhere north of ~5.3 million in this 30 year scenario you envision, will be able to repress Kosovars who will be somewhere north of 2.2 million? 

Furthermore, Albania will just sit by and do nothing? How about our allies? Europe? United States? Turkey? They all have different interests in the region, they will just allow your country to start another series of suicidal offensive wars? Need I remind you that Krajina was absolutely killed by the international communities sanctions, before it even had a shot?

&gt;How long do you think the West is going to be willing to fight for you? When Serbia is an EU member? NATO member? Fight for Muslims against Christians in Europe in say 30 years?

Ahh so it all boils down to the delusional scenario where there will be a Christian-Muslim crusade and the god-blessed nation of Serbia  will send all the Muslims back to Asia. Yeah Albanians, the most pro-European integration group in the region, we're finished! 

LOL!! I can't believe I'm reading this on a forum that isn't a YouTube comments thread. And the saddest part is, aren't you like 40 years old or something? I  would be so fucking embarrassed to read this shit as a Serb.

Some responsibility, yes, but not all. Member states also have responsibility for the funds they receive. EU isn't the body that executes all EU funded projects.

&gt;These projects in Bulgaria are now demonstrably corrupt. If the EU now continues to send money to these Bulgarian projects in the same wsy. Is that ok? For me it would be dereliction of duty.

But also if Bulgarian government refuses to do anything about the corruption, it too is a dereliction of duty. EU and Bulgarian government have already talked about the issue so Bulgaria would fix the issues. I think the policy of EU is more to give Bulgaria the chance to improve how it executes the projects after bilateral talks instead of making it impossible to execute the projects. 

I personally think restriction of funds would be wiser, but I understand that EU might be interested a softer approach to managing how the funds are used, having greater trust in the member state to get their shit together.

1770,"
&gt;How far did expectations get your leaders in the 90s?

Far enough.

&gt;Is that so? Serbia shrinks with passing time. Who is gonna fight your fantasy war in a country where the average age is pushing 43 at this point in time today? Will it be pensioners? How will Serbia conduct such an operation when its military is rated lower than some failed African states like the Sudan, and its economy is very fragile? How will ordinary Serbs react to risking their lives over your Hearts of Iron fantasy wargame, when today, the vast majority of Serbs said they won't risk a war over Kosovo? 

&gt;People who are living paycheck to paycheck in the most impoverished region of Europe will suddenly go up in arms in a war which will result in another '90s scenario because 9A4172 told them to? And Albanians with similar living conditions yet the threat of defensive war will just lie there and do nothing lol? Are you aware of how bad Yugoslav troop morale was in Kosovo on the ground during the war, how would it be like today? Furthermore, are you telling me Serbs, which will number somewhere north of ~5.3 million in this 30 year scenario you envision, will be able to repress Kosovars who will be somewhere north of 2.2 million? 

No matter how bad it is in Serbia, it is incomparable with Kosovo. 

I don't know what the fuck is this nonsense, morale in the military was great even during the NATO agression. Meanwhile, Albanians ran away in insanely huge numbers. The terrorists were a relatively small group.

&gt;Furthermore, Albania will just sit by and do nothing? 

They'll assist the terrorists, but nothing apart from that 

&gt;How about our allies? Europe? United States? Turkey? They all have different interests in the region, they will just allow your country to start another series of suicidal offensive wars?

Sovereign, not allies. And that's the thing, isn't it? We can't fight the West, that much is clear, so it remains to be seen how long are they willing to militarily support the status quo.

&gt;Ahh so it all boils down to the delusional scenario where there will be a Christian-Muslim crusade and the god-blessed nation of Serbia  will send all the Muslims back to Asia. Yeah Albanians, the most pro-European integration group in the region, we're finished! 

I'm an atheist myself, and I couldn't care less about religious nonsense. That doesn't mean it can't be useful. If you don't see the writing on the wall in Europe, I don't know what to tell you.

1775,"&gt;an economics columnist for La Repubblica 

PD's press office.
But let's suppose he's a good ethical economist.

&gt; The government has enjoyed a phase of mild expansion after a long recession. Prudent bean-counting would recommend shrinking the debt-to-GDP ratio somewhat sharply, to create a fiscal buffer for when the next recession hits. 

Italy was hit as hard as 16% by austerity, passing from 116 to 132% of debt/GDP.

&gt;Of course, the euro-zone economy is slowing, which necessitates a gentler pressing on the brakes. 

In opposition of Keynesian theory.

&gt;But the new deficit target is far too high. 

A [simple economic formula](https://imgur.com/a/RlXBUAU)([ref.](http://goofynomics.blogspot.com/2018/09/ancora-sulla-dinamica-del-debito.html))  tells us that the limit is around 3.1%. He also forgets that in previous years Italy applied similar deficits, whose only limit is the treaty's 3%.

&gt;A sensible compromise could have been around 1.6 percent, as originally proposed by finance minister Giovanni Tria.

A fake news, he denied such citation. It has been crafted by such Press exactly for this time after the target would have been set.

1790,"It was usually tied to a man's ability to stand up for himself and to provide for his family.  For the large majority of unions and men (and yes, it was men specifically), it was never an idealogy or anything related to anarchism.

It was about getting fair treatment and dignity as a man and provider to his family.  So, it was very much tied to 'manliness' and 'masculinity'. It was about not getting your balls chopped off.  Plenty of 'propaganda' was exactly about this.  In fact, I would say it wasn't propaganda because it was speaking to lived experience.

The socialists and anarchists in American unionism weren't the driving force, but more like a hanger-ons.  It was an identity-driven because it was farm boys (with largely Protestant sense of fairness of work and relation to providing for family) from the country who demanded to be treated fairly by managers/bosses from the city.  

The idealogical and political solutions came later.

""How men usually behave"" is usually tied to extreme violence when met with someone who is unreasonable.  That's been the M.O. of men and the whole history of a lot of classic heroes/folk heroes.  Unions were acting out the classic folk heroes of history.

The whole non-violence thing on the left is a religious artifact from the 60s prosperity.  And it only works if your opponent is reasonable and rationale - and you have some kind of pull.  It would never work against Trump-like narcissists because being unfair (and on top) is tied to his own masculine identity - he and others like him, live out the unfair authoritarian archetype because of their own insecurity of being treated fairly within any and all groups.  And they largely consider their treatment of others as 'fair' - so, when you have someone like that in a position of power over you, violence is actually the most natural and reasonable solution.  Unions in the U.S. were often the first to act out in violence because negotiations couldn't even begin.

I also tend to buy into a conspiracy theory that anti-masculinity, anti-family ideas, and non-violence is internal sabotage by the children of the elite who knew the proper motivations of popular reasons why men joined unions and participated in socialist causes.",,/r/europe/comments/9jq2sn/workers_in_polish_factory_pzl_≈õwidnik_working_on/e6uzl88/,Hoodwink,1538239506

1847,"The Dom Lu√≠s I Bridge is a double-deck metal arch bridge that spans the River Douro between the cities of Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia in Portugal. At its construction time, its 172 metres (564 ft) span was the longest of its type in the world.

On 21 November 1881, the bridge construction was adjudicated to the Belgian society Soci√©t√© de Willebreok, from Brussels, a disciple of Gustave Eiffel, and author of the project. The bridge was inaugurated on 31 October 1886.

Starting on 27 June 2003, cars stopped using the upper deck, in order to adapt the structure for the metro system, that started using the bridge on 2005. Therefore, nowadays the cars are confined to the lower deck.

1885,"&gt; I mean no one seems to complain about France being called ""France"" despite French obviously not being a Frankish but Latin language simply because modern day France now occupies part of the area of the historical Frankish empire.

It's our direct historical and political legacy, not just the area we occupy. And it has always been understood as such from the Carolingian collapse onwards. There's a reason why the Germans constantly bickered other the imperial dignity or the land splits after the purge of the Carolingians but never contested the dignity of *rex Francorum*. The notion that the Franks and the French are different things is a 19th c. one and the direct result of the Revolution (and that's why the Gauls started being propped up at that time). It's far more comparable to Russia, Bulgaria or Eastern Romans back when they were still a thing (though you could argue Romanians are still around) than Macedonia.

&gt;What I find most amusing is that France is called ""Frankrijk"" (Frankish Reich) in Dutch which is a Frankish language and the Dutch probably have the biggest claim to being the continuation of the historical Franks.

The Flemish, Luxembourgers and Northern Lorrains have the largest connection to Frankish history and institutions out of all Dutch/Central German speakers.

The Netherlands isn't a continuation to anything other than itself, it has as much connection to the Frankish kingdoms as England to Roman Britain.

I highly doubt that the UK would have Brexited with the euro, leaving the euro is harder, as well as creating an extra layer to get out of and it helps foster a greater sense of identity with the EU. Part of the problem was that the EU was rather distant from the UK voters, so it was easy to make the EU out to be some bad foreign power that just sucks up money and causes a multitude of problems. By adopting the Euro it creates something that is a clear connection so people would feel more engaged, although a lot of that is down to the British government as you can see by looking at Sweden. Which is rather pro EU but hasn‚Äôt adopted the euro. However it would have certainly helped.

2038,"*TL;DR: The stolen car was unlucky in that it was in an are where there was a legitimate threat against some individuals. This made police think the stolen car was involved in the threat.*

&gt;#Danish police mixed two cases - closed the country
&gt;Danish officials have now explained what happened yesterday. The reason they started the manhunt was that a stolen vehicle was nearby someone who had received a threat.

&gt;Police have now released both the wanted car and the people were in the car. 

&gt;The persons have been interviewed and released. 

&gt;This comes from the chief of K√∏benhavn police, J√∏rgen Bergen Skov, in a press conference. 

&gt;-We are sorry for what this situation has created of inconveniences, and that some people are worried, he said. 

&gt;The large manhunt created chaos in traffic, and involved police in the whole country.

&gt;#Two cases

&gt;The background for the operation that has been described as extreme, is to independent cases. 

&gt;The first was that police knew of a credible threat against specific people.

&gt;The second was that people in a fast car acted strange when they came into contact with police nearby the area where one or more of the threatened people were.

&gt;The strange acting included that they fled in the car when police tried to talk to them.

&gt;-They were the worlds most unlucky criminals, say Skorv. 

&gt;#No regrets
&gt;-It is obvious that a good police and a good intelligence agency has to gear up in a situation like this. That was why we closed bridges, and in a short period stop trains and ferries, explains J√∏rgen Bergen Skov.

&gt;The police are now certain that the car, and the three to four people in it, have nothing to do with the threat. 

&gt;-Their actions on the scene had nothing to do with the threat. It had to do with other criminal activity, say Skov. 

&gt;#Connected to Fyn
&gt;Police have during the evening Friday and Saturday morning searched a small village on the island Fyn.

&gt;The activity there is connected to the finding of the wanted car and the wanted people.

&gt;-Our operation on Fyn is not connected to the threat, say Skov. 

&gt;The car was reported stolen in Sweden last month. Danish police are going to look at what the car has been used for since then. 

&gt;-We cannot comment on what this is about, say Skov. ",Norway,/r/europe/comments/9jwegk/danish_police_mixed_two_cases_closed_the_country/e6umlx3/,MarlinMr,1538225640

I think that France gets the wrong end of the stick more often than not in European discussion as France is expected to be equal to Germany in every way shape and form and when they can‚Äôt achieve that the French are unnecessarily shit on by the Anglo side of reddit. I‚Äôve worked in France for a total of almost two years, and I hope to move back more permanently in the future for at least a couple of years. I‚Äôm not the one coming after you for your nationality. 

With that said, when people go into their native languages to argue a point it seems to me as a form of gatekeeping, in which if you do not speak the language how can you be qualified to speak unto a certain topic, and furthermore it excludes the rest of the subreddit from not only engaging in the conversation, but simply understanding it. English is a European language that is generally regarded as the lingua franca of not only the subreddit as a whole, but also in the European Union and also just the world in its current state. Like I said, /r/France is a very good subreddit for having French conversation about the same topic in French, and as somebody who‚Äôs put a lot of time and effort into learning the language especially in a country in which there is not a particularly strong support system for maintaining fluency, I appreciate that I can understand what you‚Äôre saying but I‚Äôd rather not have to in this sub. And that goes for every language that people speak in here; a flair is more than enough to give you the legitimacy of being a native without having to cut off the rest of the subreddit from understanding. I‚Äôm sorry if you feel that France is unfairly targeted in this aspect, and I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree with you but at the same time it bothers me just as much when conversations go into German, Swedish, or Turkish just as much as it bothers others when people only respond in French.",California,/r/europe/comments/9juozz/is_macron_the_new_blair_lauded_abroad_mocked_at/e6uin0k/,cBlackout,1538218710

Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy, taking into consideration the agreement, which has been already reached in principle for the cession to Germany of the Sudeten German territory, have agreed on the following terms and conditions governing the said cession and the measures consequent thereon, and by this agreement they each hold themselves responsible for the steps necessary to secure its fulfilment:

1. The evacuation will begin on 1st October.

2. The United Kingdom, France and Italy agree that the evacuation of the territory shall be completed by 10th October, without any existing installations having been destroyed and that the Czechoslovak Government will be held responsible for carrying out the evacuation without damage to the said installations.

3. The conditions governing the evacuation will be laid down in detail by an international commission composed of representatives of Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Czechoslovakia.

4. The occupation by stages of the predominantly German territory by German troops will begin on 1st October. The four territories marked on the attached map will be occupied by German troops in the following order: the territory marked No. I on the 1st and 2nd October, the territory marked No. II on the 2nd and 3rd October; the territory marked No. III on the 3rd, 4th and 5th October; the territory marked No. IV on the 6th and 7th October. The remaining territory of preponderatingly German character will be ascertained by the aforesaid international commission forthwith and be occupied by German troops by the 10th October.

5. The international commission referred to in paragraph 3 will determine the territories in which a plebiscite is to be held. These territories will be occupied by international bodies until the plebiscite has been completed. The same commission will fix the conditions in which the plebiscite is to be held, taking as a basis the conditions of the Saar plebiscite. The commission will also fix a date, not later that the end of November, on which the plebiscite will be held.

6. The final determination of the frontier will be carried out by the international commission. This commission will also be entitled to recommend to the four Powers, Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy, in certain exceptional cases minor modifications in the strictly ethnographical determination of the zones which are to be transferred without plebiscite.

7. There will be a right of option into and out of the transferred territories, the option to be exercised within six months from the date of this agreement. A German-Czechoslovak commission shall determine the details of the option, consider ways of facilitating the transfer of population and settle questions of principle arising out of the said transfer.

8. The Czechoslovak Government will, within a period of four weeks from the date of this agreement, release from their military and police forces any Sudeten Germans who may wish to be released, and the Czechoslovak Government will within the same period release Sudeten German prisoners who are serving terms of imprisonment for political offences.

2318,"&gt;Dr. Radosveta Vassileva    

Typical Bulgarian with whatever the opposite of rose-tinted glasses is. The article is also full of a quite a few lies.     

EDIT: Ok, so I'm gonna write a post explaining what  Ithink is wrong with this article and where they are lying. I also found out that the author of this piece, Miss Radosveta Vassileva, is the daughter of Tsvetan Vasilev, one of Bulgaria's most major oligarchs who had a falling out with the government and had all the blame for the collapse of a corrupt government-linked bank thrown on him. He is now hiding in Serbia but the government is clearly not interested in making the Serbian gov hand him over.    

So that bloody banshee has no authority to be writing anything about Bulgaria.    


I also want to preface my post by saying that I do think the state of democracy in Bulgaria is not good, it's not on the level of France or Slovakia or Latvia, certainly near the bottom of the EU. I also do think it's getting worse but democracy is decaying nearly everywhere so that's not  specifically BG thing.   

Secondly I feel dirty for having to write things that will essentially defend the GERB government. I hate them and I think many of them, including our PM, should be in jail and if it were within my power to make it so I certainly would. It's important to note that what's waiting in the shadows to seize power is an even uglier monster than GERB and while they do raise legitimate problems with the current gov the also don't shy from flooding the public space with lies.      

Now on to the article. It's ridiculous to say that Bulgaria is an autocracy. It has a completely working electoral process, the media although influenced is in the big majority of cases negative about the gov or the situation in Bulgaria.   

The so-called ""autocratic government"" has anything but a firm grasp of power, gathering only a third of the votes and a much lower approval rating. They can be removed at any time and indeed all the time the media is buzzing with the question if GERB will make it till the end of its term.       

In the article the author states: 

&gt;Freedom House recently downgraded the country to a semi-consolidated democracy (along with Hungary) in its authoritative Nations in Transit report.     

Well as far as I can see this is 100% a lie. If you look at the ranking (which she herself links so she can't be using the wrong one) Bulgaria has had a score of a ""semi-consolidated democracy"" for the entirety of the reports existence so it wasn't downgraded last year.      

In this report Bulgaria does better than Romania, Croatia, Hungary, all of the Balkans and unsurprisingly anything east of the EU. If we are an autocracy does that mean the author considers none of these countries a democracy either?     

The author says GERB are ""populist leaders who make unrealistic promises"" which I do not see it at all. GERB are not populist, they are just corrupt. Last election  it was extremely difficult to get them to agree to a noticeable pension increase and it only happened because it was a condition of their coalition partner. Their promises about wages were in line with past wage growth. Their management of the state budget is very fiscally conservative (that doesn't mean they don't steal). Their most populist promise were anti-corruption measures which everyone knew were a lie anyways.     


The author states that Bulgaria is more corrupt than Belarus. Well no offense to Belarus but you'd have to stupid to believe that even if you do have a source of a corruption perception study. Does she think Lukashenko and his circle don't steal at least as much as GERB? A dictatorship is pretty much built to enable such actions. And because Belarus is a real dictatorship there's no one to report on such activities.         

Really many of the author's assertion are backed by indices that rely not on statistics but perceptions of the country's citizenship and professionals. That's obviously going to lead to bias. Bulgaria is one of the least self-objective countries out there.        

To illustrate Bulgarians' pessimism about themselves I will point to the   [World Happiness Report.](http://worldhappiness.report/) Consider that in the last 5 years Bulgaria has improved by a whopping 44 places in this report **but is still** the 3rd most unhappy country on the continent. Even Somalians are happier with their lives than us. So I think that anything that relies on our own perceptions is not objective.    

Vassileva states that the 2017 judicial reforms have been regressive, but although they have been a mixed bag, overall the EU said they were positive. So if she's gonna call them regressive she should provide a more authoritative source than herself.      

Then she goes about media freedom and although I think there are problems there, it is certainly a situation tainted by the typical Bulgarian bias as that ranking is based on local journalists' opinions. Bulgaria maybe be bad but it's certainly not that terrible to be 111th. If she has to go back 10 years to cite a brutal journalist attack, well I mean that's bad but it's not that bad. I wonder if we had a murder  of an investigative journalist like two other EU members have had recently what would our score be? 170th?    

She says the economy is failing, well that's another lie. Economic growth may not be as fantastic as Romania's or Poland's but it's still good. Since joining the EU wages in euros have grown [nearly three times](https://tradingeconomics.com/bulgaria/wages). Can the economy really be failing if purchasing power has grown that much? Nevermind the actual GDP growth statistics which show growth as well.    

Then she says foreign investments have declined steeply since 2009 cause that's when GERB came to power. lol First off foreign investments fell because of the 2008 worldwide crisis and they were never very objective because they include foreigners buying Bulgarian, especially seaside, property which is vastly different from foreign companies coming here.    

The very link she gives exposes that she can't be right about GERB being elected in 2009 being the fault for investments' fall since they already fell in 2008 by nearly a half from 2007's  31% to GDP (yeah I'm sure than fantastic number wasn't a property bubble or anything). Also if she knew anything about economics she would know that GERB getting elected couldn't have affected investments that fast.    

There are other majorly  misleading news about investments going on in Bulgarian media right now but thankfully she doesn't mention them so I don't have to write paragraphs about that.         

She claims  that according to ""official sources"" more Bulgarians work abroad than in Bulgaria. Sigh... Her official source is the Bulgarian Academy of Science, which honestly loves to publish fake news and is very tight with Russian oligarchs. But even if you do trust it it doesn't take much to figure out that that is ridiculous. If there are 2.5 Bulgarians working abroad then considering employment rates that should be at least 4 million BGs abroad. If we had lost that many combined with a verifiable deaths-births loss of a million, Bulgaria should have 4 million and something people right now. Which is obviously not correct.   

AFAIK BAS gets their numbers by counting native Bulgarian minorities in neighbouring countries as far as Ukraine and basically half of Macedonia as Bulgarian emigrants.    

She also says that ""officially"" there are 2.2 million workers in Bulgaria, but officially [that is a lie](https://tradingeconomics.com/bulgaria/employed-persons) and they're much more.    


She then says that according to the UN Bulgaria is the fastest shrinking nation, but it would be more accurate to say that according to the UN Bulgaria will be the fastest shrinking nation in the world. She's probably referencing the constantly repeated mantra in Bulgarian media that we have the number 1 worst demographics in the world, but that's not really true. Lithuania  has lost more people because of their Russian minority going back to Russia and if I remember right there was another country with worse total population loss than Bulgaria.   

[Currently](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/9063738/3-10072018-BP-EN.pdf/ccdfc838-d909-4fd8-b3f9-db0d65ea457f) Bulgaria is experiencing  ""only"" the fourth worst demographic decline in the EU.   

She then goes on to talk about having relations with other authoritarian countries which is not really a good argument and I'm feeling tired with this.    

A lot of things in this article are correct, but too many are lies and the overall conclusion is alarmist and not really true  (Bulgaria is not authoritarian c'mon). Also funny how her biography at the bottom fails to mention she is the daughter and supporter of one of Bulgaria's biggest thieves.

2396,"Most of those are poor questions deliberately made to be as inconvenient as possible. They place an unreasonable amount of work for me, and are also oddly viable. Seriously, I'm not going to presumably  bring you a Slav from x place into this thread to speak on my behalf. I'd like to point out, Pan-Slavism isn't a new or fringe concept. Commonsense tells me there's more than a few individuals that would consider themselves Slav first before a geographic location.

For example, though Russia is multi-ethnic, yes, there's a clear difference between citizens of the Russian Federation that consider themselves Russian due to citizenship when in actuality firstly identify as their sub-ethnicity, and Russians primarily found on the European part who consider themselves Russian in a nation-state level, and as well as an ethnic level. If we're using Russians in a genetics sense it's important to have a half decent control group...

For example look at this inforgraphic: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?size=large&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0135820.g003

You can see as you enter Slavic countries the is a stark shift from Romance countries primarily in higher amounts of K2 DNA and low amounts of K1 DNA, naturally Balkan Slavs have a higher amount of admixture due to the many ethnic shifts in the region, but the evidence is there. This is even more evident as Romania and Hungary(Non-Slavs) break up this trend. The similarity between West Slavs and East Slavs is even more striking. Ie) Poles are closer to Russian-Western than they are to German even though they're closer in proximity and recent history.

Furthermore, the Wikipedia link doesn't discredit what I'm saying, merely emphasises that though there is an **ethnic relation**, a big factor is linguistics. Whereas your opinion is polarised: there being no ethnic exclusivity, and the relation between Slavs is one only linguistically.

2406,"&gt;You're right in that. But still, support to the Royal family is much lower in Catalonia than in the rest of Spain.

I recognize that, but the King doesn't make laws.  This is not a valid reason for independence.

&gt;Let's be honest here, even if there is hard oppression the world community just turns aside and looks to another side. Nobody is doing anything for the Kurds or the Tibetans, even though most of us would agree they are clearly oppressed.

There's a difference between sympathy and action.  Lots of people have sympathy for the Kurds and Tibetans but are unwilling to take action.  Much fewer people are sympathetic for the Catalans.  

You have a great deal under Spain and a quality and standard of life that most people in the world could only dream of.  Furthermore, your people entered into the Constitution of 1978 by the most democratic of means possible - a public referendum which was supported by 95% of the citizens of Catalonia.

Your autonomy has only *increased* since then, both with the 1979 Statute of Autonomy and the mostly approved 2006 Statute of Autonomy.  So when the rest of the world looks at you, you seem to be ""complaining"" and ""throwing a tantrum"" over very minor issues.

&gt;&gt;Everyone wants more autonomy. Nobody likes the government telling you what to do.
&gt;That's not true in Spain. Many regions want less decentralization. That makes sense, they feel Spaniards and they want the Spanish government to have more power than their regional governments. But that's not the case in Catalonia, the Basque Country and some other peripheral regions.

Eh, we're confusing issues here, but I'd still stand by what I said.  Nobody likes being told what to do and everyone wants more autonomy.  That being said, people also like social services and welfare, and economic prosperity.  Some people, some provinces in the case of Spain, are willing to trade more power to the central government because they think it will bring them more social or economic stability.  I don't think that means they like the government telling them what to do.

&gt;With all my respect, but this number says nothing. They removed the most important parts of the Estatut, you might say it was 1% of the articles, but they were the most important ones.

They removed the ones that conflicted with the powers of the central government, which the Catalan people voluntary chose to create and live under.  That's just the normal interaction between federal and local governments that occurs in every Federal system.  You're right that my 1% number is arbitrary, but the fact is that the Federal government did allow Catalonia to increase its autonomy in many ways with the Statute of 2006, did it not?  In fact, I found an article from the Economist written just after the 2010 ruling on the Statute of 2006 came down, that characterized the Spanish court's changes as ""surprisingly light-handed"": FOR a decision that took four years to reach, the rewriting of Catalonia's controversial autonomy charter ordered by Spain's constitutional court on June 28th was surprisingly light-handed: https://www.economist.com/europe/2010/07/01/a-nationality-not-a-nation

&gt;But the USA is not a plurinational country.

Maybe.  I could respond to this in many ways:

1. There are many other examples of countries with Federal (central) and regional (local / provincial / state) governments that have the same issues of sometimes contradictory laws that are resolved judicially without creating independence movements.  Some, if not many, of those countries are also subdivided into numerous regional ethnic groups.  Or do you think that Catalonia is really exceptionally unique in this regard of having a regional ethnic group that has *legal* clashes with the central government?  India would probably be one of many examples that would make Catalonia look silly.  You've got far older and more distinctive languages and cultures, and far deeper philosophical and religious differences, and far greater social problems, and far worse qualities of life, and far more corrupt governments, and yet you don't have widespread movements calling for independence.
2. There are many arguments to be made about whether Catalonia is a ""nation"" or not.
3. There are many arguments to be made, even if Catalonia is a ""nation"", about what that means (the same goes for the nation of Spain as well).  For example, what makes the difference between a ""nation"" and an ""ethnic group""?
4. There are many arguments to be made about what rights are intrinsic to a ""nation"" or ""ethnic group"".  Do they have an absolute right to absolute autonomy?  I don't think you will find any political scientist give an unequivocal ""yes"" to that statement.
5. Based on some definition of ""nation"" one could argue that the USA is (or was) ""plurinational"".  The original 13 colonies were each independently run and governed states that entered into a union voluntarily.  There were widespread differences in culture and language, to varying degrees, between the states.  Some of those differences persist to this day (though less and less so).  If I was motivated enough I could try to find some historical examples of of the difference in diction and accent between colonial New Englander and colonial Southerners 250 years ago.

I often call us Eastern Europe. We're on the border and we swing between one and the other all the time. We're in the Western sphere of influence and have aspired to be since basically the very beginning of our statehood (converting to Christianity a thousand years ago), but in many ways we resemble the eastern nations more. We have a lot of shared history and a difficult Soviet heritage that still deeply affects our societies.

This unclear situation could easily be exactly the reason to call us Central Europe - but from what I've seen, most people are so adamant to use this term because they want to convice everyone around them that we're better than Russia. And I agree that we are, but it only reinforces the assumption that we're still affected by USSR legacy and now desperately trying to distance ourselves from it.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/9jq2sn/workers_in_polish_factory_pzl_≈õwidnik_working_on/e6u8y9p/,Rosveen,1538198405

Wow. I'm gonna let this gem of imbecility speak for itself

&gt;My point is that in the history of capitalism (15xx-present) you'd likely find much more privation and brutality than in the history of socialism (1917-1991).

Privation is inherent to human existence because we come into the world with nothing and had to create a civilization over many generations. Only one system produced first world countries. Every communist hellhole produced nothing but misery and countries that took part had their development retarded by decades. 

&gt;During the cold war, the US-sponsored government of South Korea killed more civilians in anti-communist purges than the Soviet Union-backed governments did in all of Europe

2) If people were willing to live the same lifestyle as 60 years ago, they could work much less. But everyone wants all the gadgets and products that were created in the past 60 years as well so in order to buy extra crap, you need to work more 

It's down to choices. If you're willing to scale back consumption and pick what you're going to blow your money on more carefully, you'd have more time off. Most people would rather do something to get more stuff rather than do ""leisure"". Entire human civilization has been developed in this manner: need food to live, get better at making food. Now some people can stop making food and make some more pots and pans, better tools for everything involved. Now we need even fewer people for that so let's make some beer and build nicer houses so we don't get sick as often and are more productive; use that productivity to make something new and on and on it goes.

2749,"the report says something else:

&gt; The behaviour of those on the bridges of SILJA EUROPA and MARIELLA can simply be explained by their reluctance to accept whatever the Estonians did or did not do. When the first rather weak and hesitantly spoken Mayday was heard already at about 00.45 hours, the first thought of the officers on the bridges of the MARIELLA, SILJA SYMPHONY and SILJA EUROPA was probably something to the effect of ""Oh no, not ESTONIA again, don't they even know what Mayday means?"" and, indeed, the first message was not repeated. When the 2nd officer Ainsalu called 'Mayday' again rather weakly and hesitantly and even added ""please"" at 01.22 hours the reaction on the bridges of the Finnish and Swedish ferries was not much different (in the meantime the officers on SILJA EUROPA had changed watch at 01.00 hours). They simply could not believe that the situation on the ESTONIA was so bad as to justify a Mayday call, an impression which at the beginning may even have been underlined by Andres Tammes's statement: ¬ªWe have a bad list ..... I believe that it is 20¬∞, 30¬∞.... we have blackout.¬´ Only later, when his voice had become really desperate and the lights of ESTONIA had disappeared, did they realise that the situation was indeed very serious and then they reacted appropriately.
A similar way of thinking may probably have influenced the speed at which the rescue operation was set into motion by those responsible, as will be explained in Chapter 22.3.

2786,"&gt;What ethnical group you Lithuanians belong to?

Lithuanians are Balts. Lithuanian and Latvian languages are the only two surviving Baltic languages, the rest were either Germanized (example old Prussians) or Slavicized (example Eastern Galindians) through assimilation.

&gt;Are you considering you self more Slavs like Poles and Ukrainians, or more Saxons like Germans, or ... what?

Neither. We're unique ethnic group (Balts) with unique language 
(Baltic language), we don't identify with either Slavs or Germanics or any other foreign ethnic group. To note, Lithuanian language is the most archaic of all Indo-European languages. Since the Neolithic period the native inhabitants of the Lithuanian territory have not been replaced by migrations from outside, so there is a high probability that the inhabitants of present-day Lithuania have preserved the genetic composition of their forebears relatively undisturbed by the major demographic movements, although without being actually isolated from them.",,/r/europe/comments/9jlyci/polish_people_in_lithuania_1919/e6thon3/,[deleted],1538167494

We merely let the profits go back to where they should be taxed, the USA. We are among the few not robbing them and strangely they like doing business that way. We already have another tax for where the sale takes place, VAT. The EU left wing hates to see money left untapped but we've never has a strong socialist tendency. We are not as naturally suspicious of business or see it as a honey pot top dip into. That's why they like us. People can't seem to get their head around the simple truth that just because the sale is made in the EU doesn't mean all the profit is made in the EU. A tax haven pretends to discharge the tax liability of a person or company so it doesn't have to be paid elsewhere. It uses subterfuge to hide things. Ireland doesn't discharge the tax liability of US corps, it merely doesn't interfere with them as much as some Euro socialists would like. The liability still stands, with the US tax authorities.

2880,"&gt; What happened to nothing to say? At least you drop the pretense, also the one of having any argument here. Its fun how you twist and turn, bending over backwards when your own points turn out to shoot your argument in the foot.

Can you maybe at least express yourself in some understandable way, instead of using wannabe snarky comments like this and point out where exactly I was contradicting myself?

&gt; Btw has it ever occured to you, that instead of claiming an area inhabited by different people and then commiting a genocide population exchange expulsion mass murder ethnic cleansing the sensible thing might have been, dont know, to just let them have that land that obviously isnt the one of your people?

No, that has not occured to me, because it was historically for centuries land that belonged to the Czech political entity which back than was the Kingdom of Bohemia. German settlers were invited there to live there under the authority of the Czech king. Later the Czech royal dynasty died out and Habsburgs got the throne, but that did not change the fact that this was still the the Kingdom of Bohemia, the same political entity where Czechs and Jews and Germans and other ethnicities lived together. After A-H empire fell, the Czech part of Czechoslovakia was established based on these borders. And it was not just our country, it was their country too, but no, this doesn't mean thay automatically had a right to their own country.

&gt; Literally found in less than a minute, about the time its worth to me seeing you further seethe in your nationalistic hypocrisy.

On 4 March 1919, almost the entire ethnic German population peacefully demonstrated for their right to self-determination.[citation needed] These demonstrations were accompanied by a one-day general strike. The German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic, which was the largest party at the time, was responsible for the demonstration initiative, but it was also supported by other bourgeois German parties. These mass demonstrations were put down by the Czech military, involving 54 deaths and 84 wounded.

Are you even serious? I have described to you how the Nazis literaly destroyed this country, extermined Jews and Romas, and treated the Czech population like utter shit, planning to send 50% in Siberia for a slow death in labour camps and forcibly Germanize the rest and ask you to give something similar and you give me incidents of several demonstrations during which 54 people died - which is of course tragic but A) you don't give any context about the behaviour of the demonstrators, such as that the some of those so-called peaceful demonstrators in fact brought guns with them which created tensions and confusion among the soldiers, while others where simply just rioting and violently trying to get inside local municipal officies B) the bloody victim count of the Nazi occupation on Bohemia and Moravia is in hundred thousands of people instead of couple of dozens.

And to this you add that we built some schools for Czech kids in the German-speaking, and that there was high unemployment in their areas -yes, of course there was, because there was a world economy crisis and their regions were the most hit because that's where the heavy industries were.

As for the land expropriation - this is in unsourced unformation from english wikipedia that I was trying to search for to see if I can confirm it and found nothing.

How exactly is any of this comparable to the Nazi occupation?

&gt; Yeah, the czech totally not opressing their minorities.

We were not perfect, but for the standards of the time, Czechoslovakia treated its minorities relatively well, certainly better than A-H empire was treating theirs.

&gt;  By the way, did you know in slovakia they also had germans, according to the wikipedia article google spat up? Funny how they made basically no problems to the slovakians.

Slovaks were turned into a puppet state, so they were left alone as long as they were useful, had the Germans got their way and won the war, they would have met the same fate as any slavic people.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/9jl4en/austriahungary_ethnicity_before_wwi/e6t962m/,kristynaZ,1538160190
2881,"That doesn't take into account several issues. One is that Turkey severed the relations with Armenia in 1993 because of the Karabakh war and a purported rapprochement offered unilaterally by Turkey in 2005 did not take the reason for the lack of relations into account and instead implied it had to do with the genocide issue. That is not the case as later evidenced by Turkey doing a switcharoo back to framing the relations with regards to the Karabakh conflict once Armenia accepted the 2009 protocols. Second the Azerbaijani-Turkish pragmatic and realpolitik relations was well in force in 2005 ([details can be found in this paper for example](http://reviewsep.com/my_documents/my_files/4FZ_4_Dikkaya-Full_Paper.pdf)) and existed even in the 90's. Nothing special was developed between the relations of both countries between 2005 and 2009. If anything the 2009 protocols could have been the spark (or excuse) to get Azerbaijan even more involved in Turkey, but this is my speculation, which is something you hint at but with the cause and effect reversed. I am not convinced that the internal political issues of Turkey had any role with regards to its foreign policy vis-a-vis Azerbaijan. Turkey and Azerbaijan have had a constant and very unique relationship independently of internal Turkish politics since at least 1993 until today.

Yeah I think something was attempted in 1993, I can't recall either.

&gt;&gt; which Azerbaijan stalls

&gt; I did not know this, then again i haven't been watching the issue closely. Can you provide a source?

The best source is going direct to the OSCE Minsk Group material and the UN Security Council Resolutions on the conflict and also direct material from the three co-chairs.

https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm (paying attention to references to CSCE/Minsk Group in the resolutions)

https://www.osce.org/mg (for all the material regarding the conflict settlement, specifically the key principles)

https://www.osce.org/mg/51152 (The Basic Principles / core principles / Madrid Principles)

https://www.osce.org/mg/287531 (OSCE response to the April 2016 mini-war)

And as an example this recent conference given by the US Helsinki Commission (which would basically be the US co-chairmanship of the OSCE Minsk Group) - I recommend listening to what Warlick (the guy sitting in the right) says, starting somewhere in the middle of the embedded video: https://www.csce.gov/international-impact/events/averting-all-out-war-nagorno-karabakh (or just check out the transcript here pages 12-14 (even though the whole document should be read): https://www.csce.gov/sites/helsinkicommission.house.gov/files/Nagorno-Karabakh%20Official.pdf)

And the insistent proposals for confidence building measures / hardening the ceasefire regime pushed by the OSCE, UN and other parties such as the EU, which Armenia accepts but Azerbaijan rejects even after agreeing to it in two occasions. These can be found in the press release section of the OSCE site, and I can supply links to the positions of the entities mentioned before regarding this directly from their official sites if you wish.

A TLDR is that the settlement of the conflict *has to have* the non optional element of ""future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will"" which the leadership of Azerbaijan lacks the political will or capacity to sell it to the public. Obviously the Armenian side has its own issues, but they are not as blocked as the Azerbaijani position such as Azerbaijan's rejection of implementing a real ceasefire to create the conditions for real peace and instead attempting to reserve its right to attack at will, in its understanding of course. The conflict is used for political purposes as well.

Which is a hell of a lot more independence than any of the Moldovan administrative districts... Or Georgian administrative districts for that matter... 

Independence is a scale, no nation (apart from some failed states) is truly independent. You surrender some independence when you join organisations such as UN, WTO, ICJ... You surrender some more by joining EU or NATO... 

Now, of course, South Ossetia and Abkhazia are not as independent as most other states. And it is completely in the EU's ability to make them more independent and make them less dependent on Russia by simply recognizing them.

Before the Turkish conquests, Kurds were mostly nomadic like the Turks and they lived between Iran and Iraq. They also had nothing to do with Assyrians and Armenians.

3038,"&gt;The point is that Spain is a representative  democracy, and while it might not be a Republic by definition 1(a)(1),  it is effectively a Republic by definition 1(b)(1).

You're right in that. But still, support to the Royal family is much lower in Catalonia than in the rest of Spain.

&gt;As I've explained before, in general the world community recognizes that right in cases where:  
&gt;  
&gt;A minority is being oppressed and abused by the majority, or  
&gt;  
&gt;Both the majority and the minority are amenable to separation

Let's be honest here, even if there is hard oppression the world community just turns aside and looks to another side. Nobody is doing anything for the Kurds or the Tibetans, even though most of us would agree they are clearly oppressed.

But the world community not doing anything doesn't mean I don't think Kurds and Tibetans should have the right to decide their own future without external inferences.

&gt;*Everyone* wants more autonomy.  Nobody *likes* the government telling you what to do.

That's not true in Spain. Many regions want less decentralization. That makes sense, they feel Spaniards and they want the Spanish government to have more power than their regional governments. But that's not the case in Catalonia, the Basque Country and some other peripheral regions.

&gt;I'm familiar with the Estatut and Spain had no problem with like 99% of the law.

With all my respect, but this number says nothing. They removed the most important parts of the Estatut, you might say it was 1% of the articles, but they were the most important ones.

Even if it were, Category 1 hurricanes are the weakest hurricanes - which this does not even look close to being.

Based on the graphic provided on CNN's page (which does not indicate sustained winds or gusts), this thing is a tropical storm at best (if the graphic is showing sustained winds) with maximum sustained winds around 60 mph (100kph) and will likely weaken into a tropical depression as soon as it makes landfall.  If the graphic is showing gusts then this may already be a tropical depression.

3065,"&gt; I cannot see how Bavaria has a bigger representation than NRW inside Germany. You have to explain that to me! 

Just look at the election coverage in NRW last year and the coverage in Bavaria this year. It's not proportionate. Furthermore the CSU, a Bavarian regional offpsring off the CDU, is in the federal german government and has lots of influence through this back-door. NRW does not have such a regional party. 

&gt; however you should be aware that such a vision is not realistic during our life times at all

It's not realistic in the next 10-20 years. Afterwards it depends entirely on how the EU develops. I think it's important that this idea gets more discussion. Currently when people think about a european state, they think of a highly centralistic one (because that's what most politicians who back something like that propose) but they don't see that a european state could actually lead to a more decentral system if one develops a regional modell.

&gt; Ironically in Germany the left wing parties usually favour centralization a lot and dont want to grant the states a lot of autonomy

Often but not always. There are a sizeable ammount of people in the Green party and in the Left who would have some sympathy for such a proposal (also many that don't, sure). I know a lot of people who oppose centralism personally, though it doesn't seem to be a majority sentiment among left-wing people in all of Germany. The more conservative SPD is highly centralistic similar to the CDU. When they talk about a federal european state they mean a state where Germany and France themselves would be the federal states which I believe would be downright dangerous. Furthermore I can't see how you'd ever establish a working democracy in such a convoluted system. Another thing I'd like to point out is that while FDP and AfD might pretend to be decentralist, it's not something one should buy. They have little local anchoring and don't care too much about local matters and both of them are really deeply conservative (the FDP sadly became conservative through 30+ years of cooperation with the CDU even though it somewhat opposes their founding mythos...). NEOS in Austria is I believe the only german party to support a proposal of a decentral Europe.

On the top of that, we massacred several thousand of people during the expulsions, including some women and children. And while the ethnic cleansing can be justified by utilitarian/pragmatic reasons if not by ethical reasons, the massacres can't be justified in any way, these were just extrajudicial executions which were never punished.

And in a way, I'm really sad that this turned out this way because we were living here with them for centuries relatively peacefully. Yes, there were always complications, but I do not find it fair to blame any opressive actions of the A-H empire towards us on the ordinary German/Austrian people, as A-H empire was not a democracy and so they had no control over what the aristocracy was doing.

So I really wished that it was possible to live with them in Czechoslovakia, which was a democracy, not a perfect one, but a democracy nevertherless and I would even accept that in order to make it work, we would have to give up the notion of our own nation state and accept that Czechoslovakia would be a multiethnic, multilingual pluralist state like Switzerland where no ethnicity would have a dominant position.

Well he wasn't imprisoned even technically he received a suspended jail term (I think it was a 90 days or something like that). But point taken. In any case the ECHR ruled against this, I don't know what happened (or happens) after that, but I presume the Swiss courts should've accepted the ECHR ruling. My whole point was that it is not simply about denial of genocide, but the whole thing is squarely based on hate speech which in the case of the Armenian genocide obviously it is debatable given the circumstances of the specifics of the case.

I want to say peacefully but whatever that Chinese vet administered was not painless.  

The vet suggested I put the living puppy in the garbage bin and wait for him to starve. 

I could have just moved in like the other 500+ people that walked past him, I wouldn't have to deal with the guilt if I did. But I still think I ameliorated some of his suffering and I would want someone to do the same for me.

A urge that is based on deep distrust and old hate and not really on rational arguments.

Austrians lost lots of their non-Austrian territories, but they still had their own country where they could safely live.

On the other side, when Sudeten Germans sided with Nazis, it resulted in the occupation of the entire Bohemia and Moravia and subsequently Czechs had to live under an occupation of a regime that considered them subhumans and treated them as slave labour, while the Jewish and Roma communities where straight-out exterminated. The plan for the Czechs were also that a half of them will be expelled to Siberia where they would be worked to death. In our case, there was no other country for us to go. When A-H empire fell, German speaking people still had countries for them, they could live as a minority here or they could go to Austria or Germany. When Czechoslovakia fell, we had nowhere to go, we could only wait to see if we can somehow survive under the Nazis.

3324,"one line of thought is that people have developed the need to huddle in groups as form of fighting poverty. pooling all the neighborhoods children together. making sure an elderly neighbor looks over them while at work. sharing food when someone runs out of salary in the middle of the month. they learn to check in on each other and see everything as shareable. including personal space. multiple kids grow up in one room. the ""cultural factor"" would be that its considered normal. its normal to take care of kids, and kids when they grow up take care of the elderly. therefore a house is always filled with people, chaos, drama, lack of money. this dynamic is then considered normal.

&amp;#x200B;

i guess the difference between russians and people from warmer climates is that russians might keep that in house and be weary of strangers while the later would be more ok with showing affection on the street, starting singing/dancing. 

&amp;#x200B;

but again this is just conjecture, it seems to fit. another thing to look at is the correlation between wealth distribution and climate. i think nordic countries dont experience much poverty so people dont need to ask for onions from the neighbor, therefore its seen as a sign of weakness, or inadequacy and it would just be weird for anyone to do it. also based on the level of wealth its good to know who your neighbors are, and that there isnt much in the way of past time activities. so people will be more inquisitive and nosy and that would be socially healthy, since the alternative is to sit and watch tv. just some ideas.",,/r/europe/comments/9jjpr2/finnish_as_fuck_early_morning_bus_driver_forgot/e6sf8pc/,maverickgxg,1538131736

3459,"Manners in Sweden are different though. It's a bit hard to explain, but in my memory, people in Sweden would all just make space for others. Here in Germany, most people make space for others, but there are a few who'll see, hey there's space! and claim it for themselves to spread out more. Those only react to actively being pushed back.

Usually, when people occupy both seats of a row and somebody new enters the bus, looking for a seat, the people who have their bag or so next to them will pay attention and show with their body language that if you chose you want to sit next to them, they'll vacate the second seat. I mean, they don't know if there are still free seats behind them or not. And other people will choose an empty row if possible.

The people I do this to are those whose body language shows they don't want to give up that second seat. Usually middle-aged ladies or cool young men, sometimes well made up young women. I won't do it to elderly people or people who look frail in other ways, just to those whose body language shows they are well aware they're not being a team player. And that means if I approach them and ask in my nicest I am a smiling young woman way, they can't really afford to refuse me in front of all these other people because everyone knows their bag doesn't need a separate seat.

3460,"I don't really like blanket statements like this. The wider European far-right is very diverse. While the ruling Hungaria right-wing might be getting tight with Russia (PAKS II, etc), other ostensibly far-right government have an almost pathological hatred of Russians (PiS), then there's the Ukranian far-right (lol, self explanatory). I've been spending a lot of time in Estonia recently and I'd say their far-right (EKRE) is not very pro-russian, like at all. I imagine the finnish far-right has similar feelings (if abated by the fact that Finland doesn't have a huge Russian minority).  
I think the far-right's likelihood to be friendly with russia is inversely related to how close they actually are to Russia, geographically. The far-right here in France has a bit of a fascination with Russia, but I doubt that would be the case if there weren't so many countries between us and them.

I can imagine two options, each scarier than the other :

-- either -- Trump is not an idiot, it's all an act, he knows what he's doing, which is gutting democracy for the profit of private interests

3586,"&gt;How is a radioactive element intended to be untraceable?

The expectation would have been that the police not know that polonium be used at all.

The polonium emitted radiation that is mostly blocked by the victim's body.  It's sufficient to shred the DNA of the victim once ingested, but it won't be hitting everything outside that.

There are different sorts of radiation.  I think that what most people think of as ""radiation"" is [gamma radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray)' ‚Äî the stuff that you run around with a lead shield to block.

But polonium's useful for the amount of [alpha radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle) that it produces:

&gt;Because of their charge and large mass, alpha particles are easily absorbed by materials, and they can travel only a few centimetres in air. They can be absorbed by tissue paper or the outer layers of human skin (about 40 micrometres, equivalent to a few cells deep). 

-

&gt;Due to the short range of absorption and inability to penetrate the outer layers of skin, alpha particles are not, in general, dangerous to life unless the source is ingested or inhaled.[6] Because of this high mass and strong absorption, if alpha-emitting radionuclides do enter the body (upon being inhaled, ingested, or injected, as with the use of Thorotrast for high-quality X-ray images prior to the 1950s), alpha radiation is the most destructive form of ionizing radiation. It is the most strongly ionizing, and with large enough doses can cause any or all of the symptoms of radiation poisoning. It is estimated that chromosome damage from alpha particles is anywhere from 10 to 1000 times greater than that caused by an equivalent amount of gamma or beta radiation, with the average being set at 20 times. A study of European nuclear workers exposed internally to alpha radiation from plutonium and uranium found that when relative biological effectiveness is considered to be 20, the carcinogenic potential (in terms of lung cancer) of alpha radiation appears to be consistent with that reported for doses of external gamma radiation i.e. a given dose of alpha-particles inhaled presents the same risk as a 20-times higher dose of gamma radiation.[7] The powerful alpha emitter polonium-210 (a milligram of 210Po emits as many alpha particles per second as 4.215 grams of 226Ra) is suspected of playing a role in lung cancer and bladder cancer related to tobacco smoking.[8] 210Po was used to kill Russian dissident and ex-FSB officer Alexander V. Litvinenko in 2006.[9]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Alexander_Litvinenko

&gt;Scientists at AWE tested for radioactive poison using gamma spectroscopy. No discernible gamma rays were initially detected; however, a small gamma ray spike was noticed at an energy of 803 kilo-electron volts (keV), barely visible above the background. The BBC reported that by coincidence another scientist, who had worked on Britain's early atomic bomb programme decades before, happened to overhear a discussion about the small spike and recognised it as the gamma ray signal from the radioactive decay of polonium-210, which was a critical component of early nuclear bombs. On the evening of 22 November, shortly before his death, his doctors were informed the poison was likely to be polonium-210. Further tests on a larger urine sample using spectroscopy designed to detect alpha particles confirmed the result the following day.[15]
&gt;
&gt;Unlike most common radiation sources, polonium-210 emits very little gamma radiation (the low intensity gamma ray at an energy of 803 keV is the most prominent), but large amounts of alpha particles which do not penetrate even a sheet of paper or the epidermis of human skin, and is therefore relatively invisible to common radiation detectors such as Geiger counters. This explained why tests conducted by doctors and Scotland Yard at the hospital with Geiger counters were negative. Both gamma rays and alpha particles are classified as ionizing radiation which can cause radiation damage. An alpha-emitting substance can cause significant damage only if ingested or inhaled, acting on living cells like a short-range weapon.[16] Hours before his death, Litvinenko was tested for alpha-emitters using special equipment.[16]
&gt;
&gt;Shortly after his death, the UK's Health Protection Agency (HPA) said tests had established that Litvinenko had significant amounts of the radionuclide polonium-210 (210Po) in his body. British and US government officials said the use of 210Po as a poison had never been documented before, and it was probably the first time anyone had been tested for the presence of 210Po in their body.

3587,"If Russia was cut off and Germany had to turn to other sources, could you not then say that Germany is dependent on whoever replaces them? Germany is currently dependant on energy imports, but it's a global market and these are commodities. Would you not agree that it would sound absurd to suddenly claim that Germany is dependent on Norway or the Netherlands should it turn to them to fill its orders? 

Somewhere around 1/2 of Germany's gas imports come from Russia, but natural gas accounts for only a rough 20% of Germany's energy profile. Germany's energy market is actually very diversified. Russia accounts for just under 40% of oil imports to Germany. This is sizable, but again, it's a commodity. It's also fairly typical for central and eastern Europe. But the main reason Germany is preferential to Russia is because they're so damn cheap. Really, very few can compete with them on price.

The UNSC permanent seats aren't some sort of gold star for being polite.  They go to the world's major military powers.  If all of the UNSC wants something to happen, it'd be pretty hard to stop them.  If one of the UNSC objects strongly to something, action could turn into nuclear war.  Hence, a veto-based collection of major military powers.  Instead of fighting major wars, we can just model what would happen.  Considerably less-costly than fighting it out.

If you boot Russia out of the UNSC and you have not effectively neutralized Russia's major military power status, then taking action that Russia is very much opposed to could be quite catastrophic.  You want Russia to have that veto if her military is a major concern.

At this point in time, nobody is prepared to ignore Russia's military capabilities, so Russia will stay where she is.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9je8vf/poroshenko_calls_on_un_to_stop_russian_aggression/e6s0j3m/,vokegaf,1538106542

If a German engineer were overzealous when talking to you about your car then you would trust him because you have faith he has a reason to be overzealous.

&amp;#x200B;

But with politics.... lots of countries have never had major far-right parties, or their far right parties were never that important or dangerous (or their far right parties were never nearly as extreme as the Nazis). Germany has only been a democracy for less than 100 years (I don't think Imperial Germany under the Kasier was a democracy). Other countries have been democracies for a centuries longer without anything similar to Nazism. So when a German complains about the rise of Nazism people think ""what do Germans know about democracy anyway"" or ""Nazism was just a German thing because we never had it"".

Not really, just one: Denmark.

&gt; Doesnt mean it doesn't have glaring problems but we are certainly stronger united that seperated.

Why do people keep repeating the weird disclaimer that the EU ""has problems, but..."" when they want to explain that the EU is a good thing to have overall.

Nothing and nobody is perfect. That doesn't need to be reiterated. But for what it is, the EU is the best example that has ever existed in the world. Its member states have low corruption and high happiness compared to global norms, and membership of the EU has generally improved those and other stats further.

Feeling the need to preface any happy thoughts about the EU with ""it has problems, but..."" is similar to when you'd introduce a friend as ""he might have serious character flaws, but he's a good person"" when really, you just want to explain that you like the person in question.

However, if you think about it, Tory leaders for decades have cowardly ignored the European question, signed up for the treaties and just told the moaners to be quiet. So in that context Cameron is at least enough brave to bite the bullet and place his political career and his own legacy on the line, that might be construed as selfless. 

Putting that aside, the issue of Europe is not just an issue within the Conservatives. It's been a long running thorn against the side of the British public and it was a question which really needed to be settled before we made irreversible choices to integrate ourselves into the European project. Just look at how the Greek political class threw their lot into Brussels and as a result have had nigh on ten years of austerity which makes the British version seem quaint.

3916,"Cameron didn't have much choice. Consecutive governments of both parties took it upon themselves to sign us up to treaties that never would have passed a referendum - they probably would have been defeated by margins of 60 or 70%. Cameron was just the one who inherited the full wrath of this anti-democratic policy. Consider that my dad is now retirement age. The first time he voted was on Common Market membership and that was the last time we were asked. We would likely have a Switzerland minus or Norway minus relationship with the EU today if it wasn't for this. 

Cameron despite being a posh boy who didn't know the price of milk ruthlessly dispatched several of his political opponents including Gordon Brown, Alex Salmond, Ed Milliband and Nick Clegg. The problem was that with the exception of Gordon Brown most of these people are empty suits and complete non entities. He thought he could strike while the iron was hot and get Nigel Farage too. What a lot of people don't realise is that David Cameron and much of the Tory party are believers in ever closer union the faux-euroskepticism was just a wedge issue against Labour while they were in opposition. I know Nigel is public enemy number 1 in Europe but he is a very skilled politician and unlike most politicians he actually seems to believe in something and evidently realised something was a foot outside of his metropolitan gated community. He is cut from a different cloth than most of our other politicians. 

Cameron's biggest error was being played by Boris at his own game. Boris - just like Dave believes in ever closure union and globalism. He used the referendum as a wedge with a view to ousting Cameron and getting the PM's job. He knew that after a remain vote the other shoe would drop regarding many things the political class denied and called ""dangerous conspiracy theories"" such as the EU army and he could oust Dave. He never expected to win. Because just like Dave he is an upper class posh boy who went to Eton and never leaves his metropolitan upper class gated community and has probably never had to buy a pint of milk in his life. He has no idea what was going on in the rest of the country. ",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/9jb47f/macron_says_hed_welcome_uk_back_to_eu_if_voters/e6ricvt/,generalissimo_jones,1538088992

4022,"Thanks for typing this out, it's very interesting to hear someone else's perspective on our language. I tend to forget it so often, since living in Estonia, every aspect of my life (expect for most of the internet, movies and music I listen to etc.) involves reading, speaking or writing in estonian, as it does for everyone speaking their mother tongue in their country. Perhaps it's same for you as an icelander, while for me, icelandic looks like elvish language straight out of Lord of the Rings. 

It's a small language but since we are independent now, our language is well protected now by institutions and even keeps evolving. For example, some very recent words starting to catch on well, like ""nutitelefon"" (smartphone),  ""ekraanit√µmmis"" (screenshot), or new compound words to well describe the recent political climate in Europe, like ""solvumiskultuur"" (outrage culture) or ""vihak√µne"" (hate speech).

Estonian language actually consists of words of germanic origin up to 30%-40%, then 20% slavic loanwords, lots of loanwords from baltic languages, finnish, some from english etc. but big bulk of these loanwords have adapted in spelling/pronounciation over time to adopt to finno-ugric intonation, grammar rules, meshing with other finno-ugric words etc. but it's true that we have many unique finno-ugric words too that differ from indo-european languages. For example, for number 2, russians say ""tva"", english speakers ""two"", spanish say ""dos"", latvians say ""divi"", but in estonian, ""kaks"" - absolutely the odd man out. In every list where languages are graphed out based on how hard it's to learn them for an english speaker, I've always seen that finno-ugric languages take most time to learn next to eastern asian languages.

For clarification, I have never made a special effort to learn finnish, but I kind of from the get-go understand lots of words and simple sentences, because they sound similar to estonian, but I wouldn't understand a book written in finnish. Hungarian on the other hand is WAY different - I don't even recognize any similar words, but I can sense that something about their grammar and structure has a distinct finno-ugric feel to it - reason being that hungarians are a more distant group in finno-ugric family and separated way earlier from us, while estonian and finnish probably separated more recently, like 3000 years ago.

You would start seeing trade limits and people not wanting to sell things cause companies have to much of one type of currency.

Communists were taking last food to compete on the international market.

That is complete misrepresentation of the data. The record high exports were in years prior to the famine: 1930 and 1931. I [made a chart](https://i.imgur.com/KTrGW7I.png) to show it.

The famine occurs during winter 1932-1933 and spring of 1933. Therefore record exports of 1930 and 1931 are unrelated.

Some could reasonably ask seeing the graphic: Why the hell would a state export food when people are starving?!

And it is a reasonable question, which is explained in a simple fact that in our climate, we gather 2 harvest each year. One harvest is sowed in autumn of the previous year and harvested in the beginnings of the summer of the next year. While the second harvest is sowed (on different fields obviously) in spring of the same year in gathered in autumn.

The harvest of the autumn 1932 was partially lost because of the drought, similar to the one in 1921 and a decade before that and again (cyclical phenomena). And because of that people starved.

4074,"PARIS ‚Äî In the 1950s, French President Charles de Gaulle understood that if France wanted to create its own space for sovereign action in a world dominated by the United states and the Soviet Union, it had to possess its own nuclear force. Today, in the emerging global order dominated by the United States and China, artificial intelligence has become the most powerful resource that will determine the fate of nations in the times ahead. The only chance for not just France but Europe as a whole to remain a player is to participate fully in the development of AI.

The robust competition between America and China is accelerating the rapid evolution of machine learning, which will transform all aspects of life from employment and the social contract to genetic engineering and warfare. The pace of change is so swift that being left behind will make it nearly impossible to catch up. If that happens, Europe will become irretrievably subordinated to the geopolitical algorithms of others.

A new [book](https://www.amazon.com/AI-Superpowers-China-Silicon-Valley/dp/132854639X) by AI technologist and entrepreneur Kai-Fu Lee, ‚ÄúAI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order,‚Äù ought to serve as a loud wakeup call for Europe. Not surprisingly, Europe warrants little ink in Lee‚Äôs book. As Lee sees it, while Silicon Valley and China are driving each other forward in the advance of AI, with an entrepreneurial frenzy abetted by abundant capital and a densely connected consumer base, Europe lacks a comparable innovation ecosystem or integrated digital marketplace. Its default alternative has been simply to accept the full platforms of the likes of Google, Facebook and Twitter. In essence, Europe has become a colony in the American tech empire.

Because emergent technologies arise in response to social demand, Lee does, however, see an opening for Europe. While AI development in China and the United States is driven primarily by the quest for data and analytics that can be used commercially, Europeans are focused more on protecting the privacy of the user. As Lee told us in an interview: ‚ÄúThat will cause the American giants some amount of trouble and may give local European entrepreneurs the chance to build something that is more consumer and individual-centric and that would go further than American companies would ever contemplate in protecting privacy.‚Äù

Europe‚Äôs leaders should seize this opportunity by fostering a continent-wide collaboration to put its distinct stamp on AI. The most promising prospect for Europe would be to blaze a different path than the United States or China. It could put its resources behind the [proposal](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/the-man-who-created-the-world-wide-web-has-some-regrets) of Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, to ‚Äúre-decentralize‚Äù the Internet, both to assure a fairer allocation of the digital dividend and hand back control of personal data from big tech to individuals.

This culture-bound constraint on data collection, in turn, would reorient the development of AI in a more social instead of consumer-marketing direction, which has been the main focus of both China and Silicon Valley. Europe could further choose to compete where it has an advantage in basic science. Just as Europe joined together to create the Large Hadron Collider, the world‚Äôs largest particle accelerator, European nations could cooperate on a project to be the first to build super-intelligent machines, ones that surpass human capacities.

The potential is there. The Scandinavian countries, of course, have long been engaged in the fray with such innovations as Skype and Spotify. Germany has its own digital modernization strategy, ‚Äú[Industry 4.0](https://www.gtai.de/GTAI/Navigation/EN/Invest/Industries/Industrie-4-0/Industrie-4-0/industrie-4-0-what-is-it.html),‚Äù aimed at upgrading its manufacturing base through machine-learning tools. And though not gaining much traction so far, Chancellor Angela Merkel has highlighted the importance of European Union investment in AI. She has even [mused](https://amp.economist.com/business/2018/09/22/can-the-eu-become-another-ai-superpower?__twitter_impression=true) that Europe could present a third way for AI.

France, a core nation of Europe alongside Germany, can make a critical contribution. As the most active modernizer on the European scene today, French President Emmanuel Macron is well positioned to promote Europe‚Äôs role as a third pillar of the AI revolution. Like de Gaulle in his time, Macron has an intuitive sense of what it takes to stay in the game ‚Äî and a bold political imagination to figure out how to do so. From his first days in office, he has focused on invigorating Europe‚Äôs entrepreneurial culture and bolstering state support for innovation, especially in AI.

‚ÄúMy goal is to recreate a European sovereignty in AI,‚Äù he [said](https://www.wired.com/story/emmanuel-macron-talks-to-wired-about-frances-ai-strategy/). ‚ÄúIf you want to manage your own choice of society, your choice of civilization, you have to be able to be an acting part of this AI revolution.‚Äù Drawing on his country‚Äôs heritage as a cradle of scientific discovery and the Enlightenment, he has recruited the brainy mathematician and AI guru C√©dric Villani to lay the foundation for France‚Äôs effort.

Macron is on the right track. The AI challenge may be just the summons a continent torn apart by persistent centrifugal forces ‚Äî financial crisis, immigration and populism ‚Äî needs to embrace unity more fully. An ambitious historic project aimed at reaping the economic benefits of AI, securing an independent presence for European values in the new world order and leading a scientific breakthrough to superintelligence would provide a binding narrative for a continent adrift. Such a moonshot vision would be far more compelling for Europeans than the tired pitch from Brussels that dourly sells a common Europe as canned spinach, something the paternal authorities say is good for you but that everyone hates.

Belatedly grasping what is at stake, E.U. regulators are now taking rearguard action against American big tech through the General Data Protection Regulation and other means. But if Europe wants to get ahead of the game, to recover the sovereign ability to chart its own course, it needs an innovation ecosystem that makes it the author of its own algorithms while at the same time building on its unique strengths in science.",,/r/europe/comments/9jgm6d/europe_must_put_its_distinct_stamp_on_ai/e6raf0b/,sandyhands2,1538082143

Hell, not all of them are even armed. Only three quarters of them have pepper spray/batons and only 46% are armed as of last notice and among those armed the weapons can vary from .38 S&amp;W (I'm not kidding) to modern day 9mm pistols, alongside a training that can be anything from in-depth to non-existent.

No and I didn't say that.

&gt; Yes, its called younger people taking new positions....it happens all the time, but how else is someone supposed to gain experience? Also i'm going to need a source for there being a correlation between age and worker productivity (there isn't, if any its in favour of the young)

Yes but the ideal way to do this would be to loosen Italy's restrictive labour laws and fund some apprenticeship schemes like they do in the UK or Germany. 

You're not wrong that worker productivity declines with age, but its still higher than untrained workers. Pushing older workers out of the workforce is an attractive policy when the economy is strong, not when you have a budget crisis and low investment.

&gt; You know we have a higher pension age than the UK?

And Germany? So what? When Italy is as rich as Northern-Europe or has as low debt as Eastern-Europe then you can discuss QoL policy adjustments. The correct move right now would be to stem the bleeding, but it seems like 25 years of economic stagnation due to populism isn't enough and you guys want another lost decade.

4316,"""If we simply look at the 2nd round it shows us nothing. It basically ignores the fact that apart from Macron, Le Pen was the 2nd most popular politician in France.""

You're contradicting yourself here. In your first post you say that there were several others at ~20%. And you were right, there were Fran√ßois Fillon (20%) and Jean-Luc M√©lenchon (19.5%). But according to this argument, you cannot count them despite the fact that their electorate overwhelmingly preferred Macron, aka the non-fringe candidate.

It has never happened in the 5th republic for a candidate to have over 50% in the first turn. In fact, it it very hard, if not impossible to get 40%, and even that doesn't give you the victory (Mitterand lost in 74 despite scoring 43% in the first turn, far better than the actual winner D'estaing at 32%). What matters at the end of the day is the general approval for the two candidates of the second turn.

So what do we get from this? We get that according to 66% of the French population that voted, Emmanuel Macron was better than Marine Le Pen the far-left candidate. Hence YES, it matters. And at the end of the day, it's the ""simple voter base comparison"" that wins the election. And YES, it means that twice as many French people thought Macron would be a better president than Le Pen.

I take it from the snipe about English people that you are probably not English and perhaps not British, and you probably do not follow UK affairs as closely as those in the UK so let me inform you of this. After the referendum was held we had another general election.

The people got to vote on who they wanted in government based on their brexit proposals and other issues. You can not say that when the people literally vote on brexit then get a vote on who is in government after the brexit vote during the negotiations that the people are not being represented or that they have no control over it. they literally vote on it. twice.

Wow. If you think these four countries have foreign and military policies worth getting replicated/mirrored I think this debate will have no end.

You seem to think a country should compromise its long-term economic situation to get close to useless war toys... 

Besides spreading chaos, a carrier mostly spreads the idea you have a big dick. If you stop believing you need to spread the idea you have a big dick, you realize you do not need an aircraft carrier you cannot afford. We have an appealing comparison here. How could the military experts make public opinion think they need an a-c the same way advertisers make you think you need a BMW? These people are serious, and have respectable moral principles haven't they? Unless... unless 90% of them are bound to the military industry and have huge interests in promoting a new a-c project? 

I'm going to list the major achievements of Le Charles De Gaulle, our magnificient carrier (only nuclear propulsed a-c outside the US, can cruise to the Pacific Ocean without being refuelled, so proud):

* Bombing Afghanistan

* Nearly impressing Putin
* Bombing Libya
* Bombing Syria
* Being maintained 40% of the time.

At age 15 I used to be impressed by all this glory. Not anymore.

4512,"And why would you? Judges can't go on strike or show up in TV to complain about their work conditions. I don't know why you would see judges as lazy while average judge of lowest court in 2017 had about 1.000 cases to oversee. That means that he would have to start and finish about 3 cases daily just to manage that.   


The 2015 criminal reform didn't work. It was quickly changed in April next year by the new PiS government. So now judges had three sets of rules a proceeding could be under. This made all matters messier and slower. The problem with this council (I am not 100% sure it should be called that but in polish it is Komisja Kodyfikacyjna Prawa Cywilnego)  was that it was comprised of experts and not politicians. PiS disbanded it to put its own version in place but they still haven't in the last 3 years managed to do so.   


it is true that PiS acts quicker than PO and there is some truth in that it can bear better results. But when you work on laws and you ignore any critique be it by other parties or by experts (PiS had repeatedly ignored lawyers working for government and Supreme Courts opinions) you are bound to make mistakes. They will make law don't think it through and then have to fix what was not broken (eg. lex Szyszko and the whole Holocaust law thing).  

  
I won't say that PO did only good things or that they didn't lie but what PiS is doing is not merely doing the same thing with more nationalistic slant. PiS is doing something way worse than any government since 1989. They are working to make judges accountable to the government (look what is happening in the Supreme Court - PiS is firstly putting verified by KRS that they taken over in disciplinary court while basically ignoring the rest). This changes will not result in quicker and more just legal system the old problems are still there. It will only make matters worse if only for the fact that no corporation likes to not be able defend its rights in free and unbiased court.

So the 20% split from the presidential is still there. That macron is still at 29% means that those who believed in him still do, and those that didn't still don't.

There really isn't. Between the Leave and Remain campaigns pretty much every possible problem and benefit was pushed out, not to mention the Governments own pamphlet and the information available from the EU.  The only thing that wasn't clear was the exact nature of leaving, but that isn't possible anyway as it's down to the EU and UK to agree on it.  So yes, all the information was out there.

&gt;That's not what the polls say.

That's exactly what the polls say. We have the occasional poll that puts remain ahead, but they are all generally still in the margin for error for the referendum result and look pretty much exactly like the pre-referendum polling.

There is no polling to show some significant swing to remain, if there were, it might be more interesting.

4605,"&gt;The Dutch still refer to it as ""the"" disaster, because they haven't had  one since ‚Äì not a single death from flooding in 65 years. They've  learned the lessons of the past well. Dutch engineers calculate how high  and strong dikes and dams must be to withstand the most extreme weather  ‚Äì a 1-in-10,000 storm. ¬†

Correction; that is not 1 in 10 000 **storms** but 1 storm in 10 000 **years**, which is anchored into the law.

[https://www.knmi.nl/kennis-en-datacentrum/achtergrond/stormklimaat-en-hoogwaters](https://www.knmi.nl/kennis-en-datacentrum/achtergrond/stormklimaat-en-hoogwaters)

&gt;Volgens de Deltawet mogen de belangrijkste waterkeringen maar eens in de 10.000 jaar overstroomd worden.

But I can top that up, we also have play books and test scenarios as far up as 1 in a 100 000 years. I once attended a role play scenario that tests impossible odds. It's really incredible; it's the '53 flooding's big bad brother on steroids.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Also; another thing to note is that they have separate semi independent 'governments' (waterschappen) for managing water. They can raise their own taxes, can operate on their own, hold their own elections and are some of the longest continuously running governments in the world. This furthermore protects the country against stupidity from politicians.

4613,"&gt;Do you know a more representative survey?

Estimating freedom of press with just a survey is from the start a flawed method.

&gt;How many Russians of the total population have access to internet and regularly visit independent press outlets on the internet?

Difficult to estimate that. If I had to choose a method, which is available to me without making an expensive study, and reusing someone else data... Then maybe I should base my answer on how many people know who Navalny is. Navalny is non-officially barred from TV, meaning his name is not even mentioned.

So [76.41% of the population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users) has access to the Internet, and [55% know who Navalny is](https://www.levada.ru/2017/04/06/aktsii-protesta-26-marta-i-navalnyj/).

By extrapolating to total population:

* 45% don't know who he is;
* 17,05% think that his actions are part of his PR campaign;
* 15,4% think that he is Western agent of influence;
* 9,35% think that he works for the government;
* 6,6% think that he acts in best interest of Russia;
* 6,6% know who he is, but have no specific opinion about him.

I would say that is a simple method, a bit biased. But considering that there are no good studies regarding that matter, and I'm just a person, I cannot do better than that. Therefore would be fair to say that at least 50% of the Russian population has political opinion based on free information.",:illuminati: Bunker :illuminati:,/r/europe/comments/9j0w0t/russian_antitrust_watchdog_blasts_state/e6q1bzh/,IvanMedved,1538038119

I believe they were mostly covered during the 30s, and only the minor ones survive today.

Fun fact : the Duomo in Milan is the largest church in Italy, and the third in the world.

It took 600 years to complete, from the 1300s to the 60s, and some of the canals were dug to allow materials to be transported easily to the city.

Barges destined to the building site didn't pay transport duties,  and were marked with the sign U. F. O. (usus fabricae opera), which meant, well, ""it's for the building site"".

This remained in the Italian language as a negative way to indicate someone who takes advantage of a situation to avoid paying, as in ""mangiare a ufo"", eating without paying.

Maybe that council could bring some real change to civil law and I agree PiS shouldnt disband it but reality is that PiS created council for same purpose PO would also get rid of them, thats reality of our political system, PO and PiS  dont want to have anything to do with each other. Still that council is yet another example of MAJOR problem people have with PO, they do everything too slow, and its not because some problems or anything PO literally said that its by their own choice, they out right said that its their way of doing politics, as they called it ""warm water in the tap"", I recognize that some things cant be done faster but some can and yet PO also refuses to to them faster, which is especially bad in cases where the longer you wait the bigger the problem gets(like tax evasion, or aging population and so on), PiS also done a lot more and faster to make Poland more attractive to business, also they are putting effort for business to create high quality jobs(goverment will only support those companies) and not just any jobs as was under PO.

I agree PiS did lie in some aspects, I would be pissed off more if PO didnt do same beofre, I am still waiting for that nuclear power plant that they were supposed to build few years ago(few years before PiS come to power so they had years to start it), people working on it continued to get paid while zero progress(not even place for it was selected) was made, so it become a scam for people working on it to get paid with tax payers money...
And thats not the only promise they broken over the years.

4912,"&gt; Why not creating Commonwealth of Poland and Ruthenia then? Instead you occupied and oppressed non-Polish people with intentions of polonizing the non Polish regions, that is imperialism in my book.

Only part of Ruthenia (same with Ukraine) was under Polish control. It wasn't the ""intention"" from the beginning - as I said before, the polonization didn't start until the 30's, when it turned out that peaceful coexistence is not possible, mostly due to Ukrainian nationalism. Ukrainian state wasn't possible either - and not for the lack of trying - even with Polish military support Petlura failed miserably and thereby the project was abandoned. And Ruthenians didn't even have as strong national identity as Ukrainians. It simply wasn't feasible. But it doesn't matter to you, you're gonna make a false equivalence argument with the Vilnius situation again, aren't you?

&gt; And Poland was ruled by Polish nationalists who were openly hostile to Lithuanian statehood, after all who do you think spewed most shit that we're German/Soviet puppet.

Poland wasn't ruled by nationalists. Pi≈Çsudski wasn't a nationalist. He was a socialist. Dmowski was one and he was his biggest political opponent and the father of Polish nationalism. Clearly you have no idea what you're talking about.

&gt; You would realize that having huge Polish population in Lithuania would definitely made it more pro-Polish in the long run? The mutual enmity was created due to Suwalki and Vilnius region dispute, without it there wouldn't exist a mutual enmity. After all first Polish president's brother sided with Lithuania and was one of the signatories of act of independence of Lithuania. You took the dumbest way to approach Lithuania.

What? Am I supposed to take that argument seriously? Poland should cast away its own people to make another country pro-Polish instead of including them in the country? What kind of logic is that? Who does that? Who even thinks like that? If you wish then go ahead, join Russia so they'll be more pro-Lithuanian. Just don't demand such absurdities from others.

""the new state was to be created only in the lands, that were assumed to be ethnically Lithuanian""

Apparently Vilnius region was ""assumed"" to be ethnically Lithuanian too!

The undeniable fact is that clinging to Vilnius in those circumstances was completely fucking unreasonable by Lithuania and that is why no compromise was possible. Poland made many dumb mistakes, but none of them was as bonkers as this.

&gt; Do you really think we understand this? First world Polish minority problem.

Again, what? Are you for real? And you accuse us of hypocrisy and double standards? With arguments like these? In your eyes anything that Lithuania claims, demands or does is always completely fine.

It's harder to post high growth rates the larger and larger your economy gets without some new technological disruption. The US economy is really good right now in the sense that it's still managing to grow at a brisk clip given the fact that US GDP/Capita was already high to start with.

&amp;#x200B;

Nowadays, it's just really noticeable because the US has been growing much faster than Europe since the crisis ended in 2008, which makes no sense because Europe had a much lower GDP/Capita to start with and it should be easier for Europe to post higher growth rates than the US merely through playing catch up.

No, because as far as I know there hasn't been any study carried out on this. I would be interested though in a survey asking Afro-French people their opinion on a statement to the effect of ""White people should be made to pay for the crimes of colonialism"". I'd guess upwards of 80% would agree.

Moreover, I agree that there was the need for ready and cheap apartments, but it doesn't mean that if an apartment is cheap it has to be ugly by definition.

However, I don't think that the ""ugly cheap houses"" are what destroyed the beauty of Italy, but rather the intense sprawlization and uncontrolled urban growth. In a few words, Italians, in the mass society, embraced the myth of the ""american way of life"" and therefore they started dreaming of having a big house in the countryside, going to the mall and using the car to go anywhere.

5149,"Chances are, he won't say it, and if pressed on it, he'll present a whole range of more or less bogus reasons why Merkel isn't ""really"" centre-right or conservative. 

Why is that? 

Because that's the whole shtick of contemporary right-wing populist's PR: In their own high opinion about themselves, they are the ones who represent the (more or less 'silent', of course) ""majority"". But they don't, neither at the polls nor in parliaments, and the only way to square those two obviously contradictory things is by posing as the victims.

Right-wing populists *love* to be the victims so much that they downright invent new reasons to be one, and the political profit to be had here is that it entitles them to *victimisation narratives*, which have the added benefit that they allow you to lash out at any supposed oppressor, be it ""the media"", ""the left"", ""immigrants"", ""the EU"", ""the US"" and what have you. Yes, all of them, indiscriminately.

It feels good to be the victim, because you don't need to do anything (which relieves you of having to come up with substantive political programmes about real issues) except being angry at everybody about everything all the time. 

Just look at what the AfD does. Last year, for instance, they forced the state legislature in Berlin to debate wheather or not the weather channel of all places shows a ""globalist bias"" because the weather forecast for Europe didn't show the German borders on the map.

From there, it's generally best to start out with a cement factory as they always sell and turn a profit by selling you the resources you need to build infrastructure and more factories. Be sure to have a national focus set to craftsmen in the regions you start building factories in!

From there, you can start building an economic base. I've always found that liquor factories tend to be very profitable early game as long as you have a supply of grain (which is pretty much every country anyway). Once you're confident your economy isn't going to crash and burn without your total control, you can consider going for a party with the interventionist or laissez faire economic policies.

You say it wasn't your intention to point it out and connect them, which then means you made this comment not intending to provide context like you claim you did. So which one is it. And if you did simply mention this because you happened to know about this, then why make the comment that this is bad, but not as bad as the woman. 

In doing so you are making the comparison and engaging in whataboutism, as you are saying ""Yeah this is bad, but what about this woman who was treated way worse by the Ottomans"". 

Now you say you were trying to provide context except you didn't. You simply provided a link to the atrocities the Armenians suffered on the off-chance that someone woukd think that the treatment of the Ottomans by the Greeks and Bulgarians is why they later committed a genocide. That's just a nonsensical argument in general. Your link doesn't even explain why that's wrong, so you failed in your attempt.

That's assuming that's what you attempted to do since you also that you weren't intending to make that link. You just know about this woman and decided to mention it, in which case you are engaging in whataboutism since you are saying ""yeah but there's also this much worse thing"". 

To put it simply, you contradict yourself. And if we use either one of the claims as to why you made the comment, then you either made an argument to disprove a narrative that the Armenian genocide was justified by providing a link which doesn't do that. Or you saw the picture of the woman and decided to post it because sure what's happening to the Turk is bad, but it's not as bad as what happened to the woman.

5207,"&gt; The Russian military presence in Ukraine was widely documented on social media, with numerous 
videos of Russian convoys in Ukraine and soldiers with Russian accents nonnative to the Donbass. Despite this informal coverage on blogs and social media, however, the rumor was not validated until August 28, 2014, when Russia‚Äôs state TV1 quoted a speech by Aleksandr Zakharchenko, the prime minister of the self-declared Donetsk People‚Äôs Republic, that could only be understood as referring to Russian citizens: ‚ÄúI will say something even more candid: among us are fighting active military, who prefer to spend their leave not on the ocean beaches but among us, among their brothers, who are fighting for their freedom.‚Äù^214 This notion of the ‚Äúvacationers‚Äù took hold and became a sarcastic meme for many bloggers describing the war.

I think in that case you would be both.

&gt;It's not about a certain group of people being entitled and the others not, it's about recognizing that too many people like you is a bad thing.

I think it is a sign of entitlement when you think you deserve to stay and people in a similar or the same situation you were in don't.
I've been wondering about what the metric is supposed to be here as well, because the actual number of migrants is doesn't really warrant all the hysteria.

&gt;Note, i'm thinking mainly about immigration where it's not life or death for the migrants. If they are fleeing war i think we should do the best to help them temporarily until the war is over. 

It's actually great that you brought this up as the people prone to rejecting refugees tend to characterize everyone as ""asylum-tourists"" as soon as you point out that refugees are fleeing from mortal danger. I mean I as an anarchist nutjob obviously have different oppinions on borders (they shouldn't exit) as opposed to the mean of the population, but I think we should at least offer shelter to people who aren't safe in their homeland anymore and those fuckmuppets want to undermine even that.

&gt;My guess is that most anti-semites do vote AfD, but that's mostly due to them being the most right wing mainstream party in germany. They have a substantial voting base now and i think it's hard to believe that they're mostly made up of anti-semites.

Yes, the way I interpret it is that they attract a lot of anti-semites by not disavowing racism instead of being outspokenly antisemitic. This brand of laissez-faire right-wing extremism (if that neologism makes any sense) is super appealing to people who don't want to be labeled racist, anti-semite, nazi, etc. because it provides a comfortable base of plausible deniability. Peddeling back from outrageous statements is actually a mainstay of AfD discourse.

&gt;But my current view based on what i know is that a jew supporting AfD isn't a ""self-hating jew"" or anything. It shouldn't be verboten for jews to want a limit on migration.

I don't think self-loathing is the motivation here either, I do think they don't they underestimate the scale in which their decisions might come around to bite them in the ass.",World Without Borders,/r/europe/comments/9iw7iz/afds_jews_say_german_farright_party_isnt/e6p0nyg/,Thromocrat,1537995488

Germany lost WW1 without foreign troops landing in any major numbers in their territory, they lost due to the blockade that the UK and latter the US did. Germany won the land war in WW1, Russia got destroyed, the western front was a stalemate that went pretty much nowhere after the initial push from the Germans. Germany lost to famine, not to guns.

In WW2 Germany roflstomped all of Europe, Britain got lucky with a couple of asinine decisions by German high command and managed to survive long enough to win the Battle of Britain. The Russians lost land so fast that the German supply lines couldnt get materials to the frontlines fast enough to support the Army. Again, couple bad decisions by high command turned the eastern front into a human flesh meat grinder of a stalemate. Germany would win WW2 with a little bit of luck and some better military decisions. If Britain got conquered, Russia would most likely also be conquered.

Opening any writing about Turkey by recalling the Eastern Question is intellectually dishonest. It's a meme at this point.

Atat√ºrk did not usher in the multi-party era. That was more due to the post-war circumstances the world ended up creating for Turkey. As such the ""hybrid"" aspect of the Turkish state is less feature, more compromise.

The whole ""Tukey acceding to the West"" narrative is a post Cold-war invention. The typical modernization/westernization narrative that existed before is used to tie it all to EU membership. EU membership is not a prerequisite for modernization and at times even a barrier.

The reforms that the AKP carried out can basically be summarized as neoliberalism, primarily on the economic front. The judicial reforms actually decreased institutional interdependence (read: military involvement) and brought it closer to being administered by the executive.

Putting aside the who ""sick man of Europe"" drivel, Turkey is effected immensely by Middle Eastern happenings. A future where Turkey is not involved in the Middle East in some capacity is not realistic. Any attempt at ""Western modernization"" must account for this precarious web of entanglements.

5509,"&gt; how do you measure it? proportional to what? who measures it?

I'll give you examples. If someone tries to slap you, you can catch their hand or shove them away for example. This is a proportional use of force in self-defense, given the severity of the attack. If someone tries to shoot you, then you're allowed to throw a rock in their face and bust their head open, that is proportional because your life was threatened. However, if someone in the club tries to slap you, and you stab them in the eyeball with a kitchen knife, then that is not proportional and is not considered self-defense, thus you will go to jail.

It's determined on a case by case basis, by a court of law. 

Inb4 ""yeah but you're not a court of law"", well, I don't have to be, because from what we know those people were posing no immediate danger for anyone, thus shooting to kill is obviously not proportional.

&gt; once again how do you measure when it's lethal force and when it's not?

Again, determined on a case by case basis, lethal force means acting with a force that is capable of taking someone's life in a normal situation, non-lethal force is the opposite. Shooting for someone's leg is non-lethal, and it is meant to stop them without killing them(even if in some rare situations it might lead to death, normally it does not), however, aiming for the chest/head is obviously done with the intent of killing, thus it is lethal force.

[https://sspx.org/en/faq-page/but-shouldnt-we-follow-the-pope-faq7](https://sspx.org/en/faq-page/but-shouldnt-we-follow-the-pope-faq7)

The ex-leader of the SSPX, Fellay, was very keen to fully reconciale all differences with Rome. Benedict was as well and they came close no fewer than 3 times (the first time they got close a super toxic element of hte SSPX split off and founded the SSPX resistance and the SSPX has been much healthier since their departure). There were a lot of rumors coming out of Rome that the agreements were sabotaged by ideologically-motivated aides.

Now the SSPX has elected something of a hardliner a few months ago, Pagliarani. I think their attempts to fully get their canonical situation under control are going to have to wait until the next Pope. Francis hasn't pushed any issues with them, and indeed he has actually avoided pushing issues with them, but I don't think he is motivated to finish the ordeal like Benedict was. Un-excommunicating the SSPX bishops did a TON for the relationship and over the last few years there has been a large increase in people that will go to mass at an SSPX church and later an eclessia dei tridentine mass without even thinking about it. The back and forth of SSPX folks and hte greater traditionalist community has been, imo, paving the way to complete reconciliation in the coming decades.",,/r/europe/comments/9iw24i/the_new_campaign_from_the_catholic_fundamentalist/e6o95bx/,[deleted],1537973647

You chose to secede and live in your Green White and Orange bubble. You chose a border.

&gt;That would be political suicide for any Irish politician to suggest for the following reasons that Irish people know.

Which simply means a hard border between yourselves and the UK. I'm not saying it's a bad choice, but it's a choice and you must own it.

&gt;We are the most pro EU country in Europe and with good reason, 50 years in the EU has made us one of the wealthiest countries in the world with a better standard of living than citizens of the UK, compare that to 100's of years under British Rule which made Ireland the most impoverished country in Europe.

You have been a leech on the EU and it won't last forever.

&gt;Irish people don't want a border, but if one is necessary to protect the integrity of the EU we will grin and bare it

Again, that's your choice. I'm not sure an Irish government will survive putting up a hard border though.

&gt;make no mistake the blame will be put on the UK Government solely and nowhere else

Brexit is one reason. The EU and Irexit ~100 years ago are others. Countries have borders and you decided to become a country. Accept your borders.

&gt;Irish people are politically informed and are used to political debate due to regularly having referendums.

As are we. Though you generally vote again and again until you give the *right* answer. We won't make the same mistake.

&gt;We will just wait a few years, and due to the changing demographics of Northern Ireland and a no deal Brexit, the people of NI will vote for a United Ireland themselves.

5763,"&gt;even citizenship with their modern sense, as if when Rome split they kept their passports and biometric IDs and stuff

Uhm...Rome had citizenship, the status of being a Roman citizen was infact extremely important as it was what gave you basic political rights (this is kind of why the Social War broke out, it was a pretty big deal). They didn't have passports, but they did have citizenship. 

Once again your stance comes off as extremely ignorant.

&gt;continuously talking about identity in an era where that didn't exist

Identity didn't exist in the Middle Ages? News to me. Nationalism didn't exist, but identity is merely what one identifies with or as, in this case what a collective identifies as. If you asked someone in Medieval England what they are, would they have ceased to function? Was identity not invented yet?

&gt;show me someone in the entire Greek history who called himself Roman without it being literary hiperbolae, pride trough antiquity, or pressing a claim on Roman prestige for political reasons. Show me that simple, Roman peasant

Well peasants in the Middle Ages did not leave behind much writing, however I can give you a modern example which does show how cemented the Roman identity was. Peter Charanis was a Greek-American Byzantine historian, he was born on the (at the time) Ottoman island of Lemnos in 1908. Charanis recounts an experience he had in 1912, when Lemnos was captured by Greek troops. Following the capture of the island Greek soldiers would station themselves in the public squares. Charanis as a young boy ran with his friends to the public square to look at the troops.

One of the soldiers proceeded to ask ""What are you looking at"".

In which the children responded ""At Hellenes"".

The bewildered soldier then asked ""Aren't you Hellenes too?"". 

The children replied ""No, we are Romans"".

Charanis would later go on to identify as a Hellene later in his life, but I think it speaks volumes that random children, on some remote Greek island, as late as 1912 identified as Romans and saw Hellenes as something different. Therefore using Occam's razor
we can pretty safely assume that this identity (which rooted back to late antiquity) was also held by Greek peasants of the Middle Ages, as the reason the Roman identity died out in the 20th Century was access to public education and social integration.

&gt;and not see the difference in culture, or pretend that,

Strawman, my entire argument was that culture changes. Just because a culture changes doesn't mean that culture is dead.

&gt;during Roman rule, Greek culture completely disappeared,

Greek identity completely dissapeared and Greek culture became surrplanted by Roman culture. I have given multiple examples of how the ""Byzantine Empire"" was Roman culturally, you have given zero reasons for why it was Greek other than language.

I refuse to even entertain this argument before you can atleast give me the same courtesy I gave you.

&gt;since calling yourself Roman makes you one

The deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Aleksander Gruszko, commenting on plans to deploy a US military base in Poland, said that it would be contrary to the interests of pan-European security and assured that Russia has different ways to strengthen its security.

In an interview for the RIA-Novosti agency in New York, Gruszko warned that the creation of the base would force Moscow to take ""military and technical precautions"". These steps - as he stressed - will ensure Russia's security in the new conditions. ""We have various possibilities to strengthen our security, including those that do not require expenditures,"" he declared.

The deputy head of Russian diplomacy said that the deployment of a US base in Poland would be a step ""inconsistent with the interests of pan-European security"".

He also stated that the creation of the base would mean ""destroying"" the Act constituting Russia-NATO. ""Our attitude is negative for many reasons, because such a decision - if it is implemented - will mean further deterioration of the security situation,"" said the diplomat.

Gruszko also stated that such a step would mean that the US and their allies are returning to models of ensuring security known from the Cold War era. In his opinion, the deployment of the US base near the Russian borders would aim at ""projecting power towards the Russian border"".

The deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs assured that Moscow ""does not evade dialogue"". ""We are constantly discussing these issues in the context of Russia-NATO relations, because it was precisely within this framework that appropriate NATO commitments were formulated and documented,"" he declared.

Last week, President Andrzej Duda talked to the White House with the President of the United States, Donald Trump. One of the main topics was the issue of deploying permanent US military bases in Poland. Trump said: ""Permanent bases in Poland is something we will certainly talk about, we are considering something like that."" The presidents also signed a joint declaration which, inter alia, he says that Poland and the US are committed to considering options for strengthening the US military role in Poland.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/9j0r6z/moscow_threatens_warsaw_usa_base_in_poland_will/e6nsuf0/,Tartyron,1537951636

5830,"&gt;Of course they can: By making laws and by exercising their constitutional prerogatives, like initiating a presidential recall referendum. What do you think the legislative branch does?

They have been trying hard to do that, but lawmaking and policy changes remain the prerogative of the government. All you had to say to that was that the obstacles they faced in this process were unconstitutional, and that is your opinion, but I'm sure this is debatable, and one had to look into Venezuelan law to make a statement about that. If some government actions were unconstitutional, that's a pity, but in the end its just nitty-gritty that doesn't matter when you think about the situation Venezuela finds itself in. In South Korea for example, the last government has broken the constitution way more, in a way more terrifying fashion, but nobody would go ahead and compare South Korea with Venezuela. In the end law serves as an instrument of the status quo, and right now we find two interests clashing in Venezuela, that of the Venezuelan right-wing, and the people's government. Legal positivism isn't the end of all things, I don't believe fascists have a right to abuse democratic institutions, for example (I'm not claiming all opposition in Venezuela are fascists, but Latin American countries have a tradition of anti-communist, fascist coups).

&gt;What do you mean? Bring evidence.

I posted it. Two articles, one from a ""biased source"", the other one from a mainstream outlet. Are you now gonna defend the opposition so much that you will deny that this has happened?

&gt;What are you referring to? Both the armed forces and the paramilitaries (""colectivos"") (bonus) back the despot. Or do you think the opposition orders to oppress and repress itself?

First off, I wasn't referring to *all* the military, and I think you are being deliberately dishonest here to claim that I did because the context was clear. There are evidently fascist conspirational cells in the military, as we can see through the terrorist attack on the Supreme Court with an attack helicopter. Regarding that, what do you think would the US do if a squad of US Green Berets would start firing at the Supreme Court? Talking about this, the US president has made decisions since 9/11 to rather undermine the constitution instead of upholding it. Comparing that to the siege situation of Venezuela, and their crisis, we are holding Venezuela to a different standard than most countries, leave alone Latin American countries who mostly aren't a shining beacon of legalist democracy.

Regarding the collectivos, yes, I think they are a good thing. They are grassroot militas to protect the communities, in a country that has one of the highest crime rates in the world and is known for its corruption. It's an attempt of building dual power.

&gt;However, it's worth noting that no political leader in the opposition called for violence, quite the opposite. Moreover, the majority of protests have been peaceful and the violent individuals among the opposition are a minority.

Sure. This is the list of victims during the violent protests of the opposition:

&gt;14 during lootings

&gt;Eight of whom died electrocuted when they intended to loot a bakery in El Valle; one died during another looting when the owner shot him dead; and the owner of a small restaurant was killed by the looters;

&gt;9 in street barricades

&gt;Most of whom died when trying to cross them leading to their vehicles overturning and/or were confronted by violent armed demonstrators who were guarding the barricades;

&gt;7 by law and order officers

&gt;The culprits have been identified, all have been arrested and all face prosecution; 29 is the total number of officers arrested for these deaths;

&gt;3 shot by firearms

&gt;From arms fired by criminal gangs

&gt;2 by lynching

&gt;A retired lieutenant of the Bolivarian national Guard and a young man who was participating in opposition demonstrations was set on fire alive and died due to 80% of body burning

&gt;1 health condition

&gt;A person could not get to an emergency health center due to the street blockade installed by armed opposition gangs

&gt;1 in a fight

&gt;Among members of a gang in a barricade;

&gt;17 passers-by

&gt;Who had no connection whatsoever with either opposition protests or governmentdemonstrations ‚Äì one of them, Almelina Carrillo, was killed by being hit in the head by a bottle containing frozen water thrown from a building by opposition lawyer Hugo Trejo;

 	 
&gt;3 members of the law &amp; order forces

&gt;One of them was shot dead by a sniper, the other two were brutally killed by opposition protesters

&gt;24 persons have died in unclear circumstances 

&gt;Their cases are still under investigation ‚Äì six of these have died by being hit with ball bearings fired from ‚Äúmetras‚Äô, home made guns, used by opposition protesters; two of them would be passers by; two more would have died by the action of the forces of law and order.

&gt;One of the ""ingredients"" of Castro's recipe is exactly making everyone poor so that they're completely dependent on the handouts of the regime.

I am still not getting that argument, if the US government delivers foodstamps for the poor, does that mean they are ""completely dependent"" on the US government/""regime""? Are you a libertarian by chance?

Regarding Cuba, I still don't fly with you. I have already made a post where I stated that there are significant differences between Venezuela and Marxism-Leninism, and secondly your accusations against Cuba seem also to be kind of void considering the Cuban people were dependent on American investment during the Batista dictatorship, something that was cut off after the Cuban revolution. Compared to other countries in the same region, Cuba's HDI and living standard is quite decent.

&gt;There's no welfare state to start with. In Venezuela, ""social missions"" are oriented to get political consensus, and in any case nothing works anymore due to total lack of resources, and because the economy has collapsed. Also, indirect subsidies (e.g. free electricity, petrol, subsidised food) are regressive measures, meaning that they benefit those who consume the most. Brilliant!

So on one hand Venezuela gives hand-outs to the poor to secure their votes, but then also gives free stuff to capitalists? If that little calculation of yours is true, than that is supporting my argument that the Venezuelan government should finally expropriate the capitalist class, which is not what they are doing which is why I remain sceptical of Chavismo.

&gt;Because it would have been an electoral fraud. At best the lower courts would've had an ancillary function in the case.

I'm pretty sure identity theft is a crime as well, under criminal jurisdiction. If I am doing this in my country, I would be persecuted by criminal courts. An issue can affect two branches of the jurisdiction at the same time.

&gt;Here your ignorance shines through, Mr Leninist! Look up ""separation of powers"", which is the bedrock of modern democracies. The judiciary is never fused.

In theory, in practice, not so much. In the US the president appoints the Supreme Court judges. Both are serving as the ruling apparatus of the bourgeoisie. ""Seperation of powers"" is an idealist spook.

&gt;This is a good introuction of the subject.

The problem with this (and your) analysis is that it views the events in Venezuela as an isolated, hermeneutic mechanism in a vacuum, which is not how the world works. As I posted before: Norway as a higher state quota than Venezuela. What this analysis seems to lack is *any* mention of sanctions against this country - which is quite ridiculous considering Venezuela is totally reliant on oil exports, which plummeted after the oil price fell. This is also my main critique of Venezuela: Chavismo had almost two decades now to diversify the economy, instead they focused on a bloated welfare state instead of a Keynesian investment program. This is opposite from Marxism-Leninism, as I have pointed out before, and has more to do with the paradox of capitalist countries rich of resource, as there is no incentive to diversify the economy. The issues they are facing are much deeper than just some short-term policy decisions of the government, however, I will concede that most of the criticism towards certain policies might be justified the way they were implemented - in a half-baked way, still leaving Venezuelan capitalists in power.

What is the offical reason for the sanctions anyway? It's not like Venezuela is building missiles or whatever. I mean, forget it, we all know what the reason for the sanctions is, right?

&gt;Even if all that were true, that's nothing compared to the 1 trillion dollars earned in the last oil boom, of which nothing is left.

Because of misguided investment.

&gt;Again: 60% of people in Venezuela were in extreme poverty in 2017, and most are starving.

Again: Show me if the rate of abject poverty has been increasing. Because that is what matters.

&gt;most are starving

You had people doing mass suicides in Okinawa when the Americans invaded, after all. The Soviet Union, as brainwashed and bad as it was, did not come near to the cultural hegemony of the cult of the emperor and the still remaining influences of the Bushido code in the mentality of the Japanese.

&amp;#x200B;

After all - even the Nazi will to fight died soon after the war. Some Japanese soldiers continued guerrilla fighting in the Pacific islands for decades after the war. Yet their nation surrendered. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically Stalin's freak emotionless mentality should not be used as a discounting factor when it comes to a hypothetical scenario in regards to the USSR vs the Allies. We should not forget that a large part of the German failure in Russia came from their racial policies and their actions against the locals, that was easily exploited for Soviet propaganda. It's hard not to stand and die if you know that the enemy will destroy you and your people. 

There's a reason why the war on the Western front and the war on the Eastern front in the end were two different animals. A ''Western'' Eastern front could have easily led to mass defections and strife within the Soviet society itself, as an example, and Stalin throwing in the towel against the Allies seems much more reasonable than making peace with the Germans.

After the second world war, Hitler went hiding there because the place is a favorable soil for fascism.
