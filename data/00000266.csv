15,"&gt;First of all there are elections way much earlier than 2022 and it will be interesting to see but speculating is useless. Marine Le Pen is highly criticized within her own party, her right arm is gone, her niece is gone. Her party is brain dead as usual and as usual it is its main weakness.

&amp;nbsp;

Okay fine that's definitely debatable.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I don't see the correlation between Macron's proposal and the recent event. ""Especially"" nothing. If you think this event will have an impact upon an election in 5 years you are deeply wrong and if you think some non-media are needed to bring this kind of events in the news you are being misled, the domestic press does it well. Le Figaro or Le Parisien were not going to miss that, BFMTV didn't miss it and it was one of the day's main subject. But because it was recorded and spread and the Internet, it got overblown. If you were really interested in it, you would have known that another officer was wounded in an unrelated but similar event at roughly the same time at it was reported in the press as well.

&amp;nbsp;

I know about that incident regarding the French police woman who got beaten down and kicked in the head numerous times. Saw that too. It's gonna affect the coming elections because people can see underlining tension in French society regarding different groups be it different race, different relive, different language and different ideology. It's all part of identity politics the French far right like to play on.

&amp;nbsp;

And? Why would they need to report what is merely a local event? Do you want to know when a cop is wounded in Germany, killed in Italy or do I want to know if a first responder is wounded in South Africa? Do you want to know that a cop lost four teeth near my hometown less than 24hrs ago?

&amp;nbsp;

This makes it look weird not reporting it, like a few cars burned in a parking lot in London on new years eve it makes international news, a building burns down in new York it makes international news, but something like 1000 cars are torched near Paris and media silence. I mean it just doesn't make sense.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage

&gt;In Roman Catholicism, all marriages more distant than first-cousin marriages are allowed

However

&gt;Protestant churches generally allow cousin marriage,[173] in keeping with criticism of the Catholic system of dispensations by Martin Luther and John Calvin during the Reformation.[22] This includes most of the major US denominations, such as Baptist, Pentecostal, Lutheran, Presbyterian, and Methodist. The Anglican Communion has also allowed cousin marriage since its inception during the rule of King Henry VIII. According to Luther and Calvin, the Catholic bans on cousin marriage were an expression of Church rather than divine law and needed to be abolished. Protestants during the Reformation struggled to interpret the Biblical proscriptions against incest in a sensible manner, a task frustrated by facts like their omission of the daughter (but inclusion of the granddaughter) as a directly prohibited relation.[8] John Calvin thought of the Biblical list only as illustrative and that any relationship of the same or smaller degree as any listed, namely the third degree by the civil-law method, should therefore be prohibited. The Archbishop of Canterbury reached the same conclusion soon after.[23] But in contrast to both Protestantism and Catholicism, the Eastern Orthodox Church prohibits up to second cousins from marrying.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7nuotj/dispatches_when_cousins_marry_channel_4/ds623u9/,vokegaf,1515048890

100,"&gt; I wasn't sure whether per capita numbers would be significant, since a large company in a country with a low population wouldn't have many employees.

Well, this was mostly about how you (accidentally or erroneously or maybe meaning something different) made a reference to per capita numbers when they are absolute numbers.

Per capita numbers should be fairly comparable for SMEs and corporation sizes tend to follow Zipf's law. In any event, while per capita numbers may or may not be useful, comparing absolute numbers for countries of vastly different size definitely makes no sense.

For what it's worth, Germany's two largest employers are the two major Christian welfare organizations, with approximately half a million employees each. This is on par with the largest US employers, except for Walmart.

&gt; France has a higher portion of companies with less than 10 employees, but a lower portion of companies with fewer than 20 or few than 50 employees.

Nothing new, since France specifically encourages so-called micro enterprises (roughly classified as up to 10 employees, up to €2 million annual revenue) through policy and legislation.

&gt; Germany has a lower rate of companies with less than 10 employees than the US, but a higher percentage employing more than 250.

Yes, as especially the larger Mittelstand enterprises sometimes grow beyond 250 employees. For example, [DELO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DELO_Industrial_Adhesives), which dominates the world market in smartcard adhesives, has 560 employees. The 250+ category is fairly bottom-heavy in Germany (to the point that Germany generally uses a 50-500 category for medium-sized enterprises domestically).

&gt; Either way, my point was that the rate of self-employment wasn't related to the average size of companies present in each country.

It's just some regions and cultures are largely practicing it still, no matter if they're Muslim, Christian, Hindu or Yazidi. That being said, let me clear that, your own logic, it was a Christian phenomenon as well just a century ago, or two at its best. It wasn't some, believe me. Yet, there is also no such a thing as Christians were doing it, like Christian North Caucasians weren't doing it either, nor Christian Albanians; while of course most of the Catholic and Protestan Europe and North America was practicing it back then.

-Ignores the European intervention of Libya (where a huge chunk of these refugees are coming from might I add.)

-Ignores the fact that every country's economies go through ups and downs, and that the US is somehow at fault for having the same problem because they have a currency that matters on a global level

-Says the US is at fault for giving any support to a country being invaded by Russia

-Says that Russia is the victim of the whole situation in Ukraine and that the US is the one who started all of it.

-Ignores that Saudi-Arabaia is liberalizing under their new de-facto (and soon to be official) leader.

-Ignores that there is only a problem in Korea because the US stopped an invasion from the North, and that North Korea constantly threatens the South, Japan, and the US.

-Ignore that every country around Isreal and many of Isreal's own citizens want the country gone and have declared wars to try to end them before.

-Ignores that Germany asks the US to spy on its own citizens just like the US asks Germany to spy on its own citizens so that they can trade information and abide by the laws of their country (we won't spy on our own citizens, we just get our allies to do it for us.)

""I for one hope that Europe can come together to finally stand up for itself at home and abroad. A weak discord of small states slavishly hanging on the lips of the US will continue to fail at achieving its global potential and will fail at delivering opportunities to it's citizens.""

This specific statement ignores the fact that Europe has often threatened trade wars with the US, despite the fact that we have a deficit with almost every European nation, because we want to lower our domestic taxes or put some tariffs on a European steel.
It also ignores that certain countries in the EU did not participate in the initial invasion of Iraq. 

There's so much wrong with this idea that Europe sucks the dick of America that's purported by Euronationalists, or whatever you want to call people that conveniently ignore the facts to paint this specific.

Russia has a woeful economy because it has little more to offer than an abundance of natural resources, such as oil, in a time when the price of oil happens to be at an historic low.

Here is how the street where post of the pictures were taken looks like today:

170,"One of our major pieces of literature is [*The Scarlet Letter*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scarlet_Letter).  It details the (dramatized, but [based on a real event](http://mentalfloss.com/article/60554/10-ignominious-facts-about-scarlet-letter) and following real laws) case of a woman in Puritan America, who is convicted of adultery.  As part of her sentence, she is required to wear a scarlet ""A"" for ""adulterer"" on her dress for the rest of her life.

The novel covers her life, shame, and so forth.  It does not paint the practice in a favorable light.

I do not automatically object to society determining the bounds on sexual norms and legally-enforcing them.  They might be laws against sodomy, adultery, incest, beastiality, statutory rape, or child molestation, but sexuality is a significant part of human life, touches on society in many areas, and I do not reject out-of-hand laws against them.

However, I am not sure that I much like leveraging ostracism in the justice system.  Its effects are hard to control.  They do not seem to evenly-affect those punished.

And, importantly, I believe that there is value to having a light at the end of a tunnel.  Your sentence might be ten, twenty, or thirty years, but it will end at some point, and you've an opportunity to reenter society. At that point, you should have a stake in society again, be a full citizen. If you cannot reenter society, then simply give someone a sentence of life or of death, I say — but if there is value to society in retaining them, then there is need to give them a full stake.

I do not at all say that the US follows the principle here that I'm talking about.  We publicize the crimes of sexual offenders.  Obviously, a criminal record can impact employment prospects.  Felons, even when freed, can be stripped of their right to vote in some states, as well as their right to bear arms.  We [chemically-castrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_castration) sexual offenders — huh, looking at Wikipedia, it looks like you also have just adopted the practice.

But broadly-speaking, I think that part of keeping people on the straight-and-narrow is giving them something to lose.  Someone with a stake in society is someone who has a reason not to offend against it.  Obviously, there's also something to be said for having a harsh-enough punishment to deter them in the first place.  But I think that it is better to make the punishment something to be done and gotten through and completed.  I'd rather have harsher sentences that are time-limited than sentences that permit offenders back into society, but as second-class citizens.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7ntf3j/poland_launches_open_online_list_for_child_sex/ds5xcvj/,vokegaf,1515041099

Dude, I linked you to the stuff i was talking about, if you were going to take issue with my understanding of the more general term there was a good moment to talk about it.

&gt;Modern fracking was developed by a dude in Texas named George Mitchell in the 1980's and 1990's and then quickly adopted by numerous other firms in the 2000's after he perfected the technique 

Mann, please, just give up, you have made a complete fool of yourself, it's almost painful to read at this poing.

America has the lowest self-employment rate in the OECD aside from Luxembourg, so Europe seems to be better at the development of small corporations. These days, tech startups in America tend to either get bought by larger corporations or destroyed by them.

/u/sandyhands2 was correct to point out that self-employment is not the same thing as developing small businesses. From [the OECD](https://data.oecd.org/entrepreneur/enterprises-by-business-size.htm): the only EU member with more companies employing less than 10 employees is Italy.

&gt;Hydraulic fracturing (ALSO FRACKING, fraccing, frac'ing, hydrofracturing or hydrofracking) 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_fracturing


Everyone in normal parlance uses ""fracking"" to refer do hydraulic fracturing. You would know that if you knew what you were talking about. 

Modern fracking was developed by a dude in Texas named George Mitchell in the 1980's and 1990's and then quickly adopted by numerous other firms in the 2000's after he perfected the technique .


Or, as The Economist Eulogized him in 2012

&gt;The rise [in shale gas] has been helped along by a variety of factors.... But the biggest difference was down to the efforts of one man: George Mitchell, ...who saw the potential for improving a known technology, fracking, to get at the gas. Big oil and gas companies were interested in shale gas but could not make the breakthrough in fracking to get the gas to flow. Mr Mitchell spent ten years and $6m to crack the problem (surely the best-spent development money in the history of gas). Everyone, he said, told him he was just wasting his time and money.

312,"You know what, my own controversial opinion about this is that it must go the opposite direction of what the current political discussion is often saying.

People sometimes say, 'Yeah, if men are sexually harassed nobody takes it seriously' But I think that is a simplification of the truth and a bit of hetero[idk] thinking. The point is that M (man) -&gt; M, W (woman) -&gt; M and W -&gt; W harassments aren't really taken seriously and that M -&gt; W harassments are the only category (of harassments) that is taken seriously. If a woman is harassed by another woman people also don't take this seriously.

But here is the problem: the victim in these situations also does not take it seriously. There really are plenty of things one sees boys ans girls do with each other for fun like hitting the butt, which, if a boy would do this to a girl (and not the other way around) would suddenly be seen as harassment by many.

And I think that this mentality is better; I think woman are taught by society to fear man to a certain extent. I am mostly talking about playfully hitting (the butt) et cetera, not rape nor touching without consent. I think how boys between each other and girls between each other handle this is in principle a better solution and I think that girls are being excessively scared by their parents in case a boy does this and not the other way around - the world would be better if people would also be this nonchalant about it in the M -&gt; W direction. Many people seem to want to go in the opposite direction (so people should be as frustrated about all 'harassment' in the other directions) which would make the world more complex. You for example also see it when thinking about how people treat changing rooms. Men together with men or women together with women is fine, a woman who enters a mens changing room is not considered a creep, but a man who enter a womens changing room is, right?

No, the reason I made that argument is because you said ""Well what do you think if Germany would want a piece of the Netheralnds and that population would want to join Germany and they would just invade"" and I said that that wouldn't happen because NL would probably find a diplomatic way out and just cede it if that's what the population there waned.

Ukraine very much wanted to keep a hold of it and the people there didn't want it.

&gt; But they didn't give Suriname away, they allowed its' inhabitants to gain independence.

That doesn't matter for NL; whether Suriname became independent or joined Brazil randomly; a loss is a loss.

I'm sure Ukraine would've also denied it if Crimea wanted outright independence.

&gt; Okay, now you're just full of shit. Ukraine did not conquer Crimea. It was gifted to them. You're comparison of present day Ukraine with WW2 Germany is perverse.

Does that matter for the Crimeans who were unhappy about the Russian rule?

384,"&gt; As for the sex crimes, it's disturbing to think that it reflects behavior that would go unpunished, or is even encouraged, at home; it's certainly the case that the refugees are often uncertain how to behave with local women -- and many of them didn't bring their own. 

They don't even know how to behave near women? What do they know then? What benefits do they bring? 

Also, I have no idea how none of the politicians saw this coming apparently. It’s been known for a while now that that these countries and cultures are not progressive. That these people will have what many of us would consider to be backward views. It was rather obvious that they won't just magically fit right in. No one in 2018 should be suggesting that carrot and stick approach is needed. That strong and transparent action from the police will be needed. This should have been obvious from the start.

411,"&gt;With Fakenews France is flirting with fascism, there is a clear demand in France for the Far-right and we will see a clear inevitable resurgence in Front National once the 2022 elections come. 

First of all there are elections way much earlier than 2022 and it will be interesting to see but speculating is useless. Marine Le Pen is highly criticized within her own party, her right arm is gone, her niece is gone. Her party is brain dead as usual and as usual it is its main weakness.


&gt;Especially regarding recent events such as the one that happened in Champigny Sur Marne on New Years Eve.

I don't see the correlation between Macron's proposal and the recent event. ""Especially"" nothing. If you think this event will have an impact upon an election in 5 years you are deeply wrong and if you think some non-media are needed to bring this kind of events in the news you are being misled, the domestic press does it well. *Le Figaro* or *Le Parisien* were not going to miss that, BFMTV didn't miss it and it was one of the day's main subject. But because it was recorded and spread and the Internet, it got overblown. If you were really interested in it, you would  have known that another officer was wounded in an unrelated but similar event at roughly the same time at it was reported in the press as well. 

&gt;Complete media silence from international news organisations!

And? Why would they need to report what is merely a local event? Do you want to know when a cop is wounded in Germany, killed in Italy or do I want to know if a first responder is wounded in South Africa?

466,"&gt;ok 73 years behind to catch up to a whole new game (in competition with countries which invented a game hundred plus years ago) - 83 if you count Yeltsin years because they were going in wrong direction during those years.
piece of cake - right?

Nobody said it's easy, but you can't succeed if you don't even try. And again, plenty of other ex socialist countries are doing just fine at the moment, but Russia is stagnating. What's the difference? Leadership. 

&gt;Did it help UK people to became World Power no1.
Did it help Americans to take over and become World Power no1.

You're dodging the question. How does being a military power help their economy? (spoilers: it doesn't)

So Russia's plan is to turn the clock back 200 hundred years and start wars around the world and occupy nations and use them as colonies again? 

Sounds like a solid plan for economic growth. /s


&gt;so auto-pilot. everything they did before when encountered problems - they just did it again (based on experience in the game). nothing revolutionary about Obama.

So hire some fucking American and European economists and come up with your own plans for reforms and growth. Russia can't learn from other countries? They have to continue to stagnate until they develop the same economic policies themselves? What kind of argument is this?

&gt;Yup he basically did nothing, but Yeltscin's Russia and Putin's Russia are quite different.
Miracle.

I'm not a fan of Yeltsin or anything, but I find it really ironic that you think nothing is Putins fault because Russia was Socialist for 73 years, but Yeltsin is entirely responsible for Russia in the 90's, immediately after that Socialism collapsed. Bit of a double standard, no? According to your own logic, it should have been harder for Yeltsin to overcome socialism than it currently is for Putin. 

&gt;Yeltsin had good oil prices and was open to cooperation with the West. Good times for Russia?
Putin did ""nothing"" yet everything is different (and still better than Yeltsin years, despite everything)

The ""cooperation"" was half assed on both sides and Yeltsin was in power immediately after the collapse of the USSR. It goes without saying that it would take more work to overcome a collapse right after it happens than now.

506,"&gt; That might be ""a"" point, but it's certainly not ""the"" point. Another point is that in order for democracy to work you need to at least know who will be in office depending on how you vothe. Voters had a good idea that Merkel or May would be the leader if their parties won the elections. Voters didn't know who Juncker was before the election.

This isn't always the case. In Belgium for instance things were less obvious. The biggest party didn't want to have the PM-position, so instead they offered it to a smaller party to get them onboard of their coalition. Most parliamentary systems allow a lot of liberty in this regard and i'm not sure whether there are a lot of rules to prevent someone totally different as a PM. It's not a bad thing per se seeing as PM's are merely the coach of their government.

&gt; He controls the legislative agenda. He decides what types of legislation even gets considered. Yeah, that's considerable. Even if a majority of the EU parliament want a law to be passed, Juncker can prevent it from occurring because he controls the legislative initiative. The EU parliament can't write or initiate its own laws like a normal parliament. Juncker basically has a unilateral veto in EU legislation. That's even more powerful than an American president's veto, which can be overridden by 2/3's of Congress

No. You are confusing two things: ""the president of the commission"" and ""THE commission"". Juncker is the president of the commission, but he can't decide things alone. These powers reside with THE comission as a whole. (And as you know, the members of the commission are appointed and approved by the governments of the member states and the parliament.) This is a HUGE difference, especially when we talk about the specific role of Juncker.

Contrary to Juncker, Trump literally calls a lot of the shots by himself. He doesn't have to answer to anybody within his government because he has been directly elected. All of the secretaries of state are below him in the hierarchy of government. Obviously the Congres and the Senate are also elected seperately, so he has to take their opinion into account wherever the constitution requires him to do so.",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/7ntste/why_europe_is_willing_to_regulate_tech_more_than/ds54lrx/,Carl555,1515008934

513,"&gt; weaker countries in the eurozone already profit from much lower interest rates in the eurozone than they had before

This is a curse as much as a blessing. Greece borrowed so heavily because rates were so low, and rates were low because lenders were counting on implicit guarantees from EU countries to backstop Greek debt that never materialized in the expected way. Meanwhile Greece has been broken on the wheel due to their ""fiscal profligacy"" and yet 10 year Greek bonds are STILL only commanding a 5 percent return which is manifestly insane. 

Yes Greeks could in theory move anywhere but only inside the EU is the move not only painless but a literal right of any Greek. So the Greek taxpayer takes a Greek child, pays for them to go all the way to their Master's degree, then, because the Greek economy has been fucked from austerity, that Greek child moves to Germany to get a well-paid job.

Those who stay are true brave man, they didn't exchange their fatherland for some matter. 

Immigrants often don't hide their resentment towards their own fatherland, and seek to describe Poland in the worst light possible. It's almost always a shame to met another Pole in DE or UK. I've never meet an educated Polish immigrant with such attitude. Most of them, I believe, are always ready to come back, and treat the immigration as a learning process, rather than a strive for money or simply live and work there proudly representing their own nation.

559,"&gt;  it was a non-binding opinion poll

Technically, perhaps, in reality it was not. It was sold to us as a referendum and at no time prior to the referendum had anybody said it was non binding. 

Furthermore, the arguments that lead to us having the referendum are as true today as they were yesterday. David Cameron gave us the referendum because he was concerned that his party would keep on loosing votes to UKIP, he was elected on that mandate. 

MPs voted 6to1 to give us that referendum, at no point did they say it was non-binding. MPs of all parties I might add, why? Because they too were concerned about loosing votes to UKIP.

We voted, the question was simple, at no point did it say non-binding or similar in the question or on the ballet. 

The reasons the MPs voting 6to1 to give us the referendum have not gone away, like it or not UKIP or worse will fill the void of mass disillusionment should a ruling party turn it's back on the referendum.

Feel free to look here and see what the government itself said about the referendum in their Remain propaganda peice they sent to every house hold in the nation:

&gt; This is your decision. The Government will implement what you decide.

Note it doesn't say, 'The Government might consider what you think'.

All of their most modern army divisions with the latest tanks and planes, is targeted towards Poland , Baltic states , Ukraine and Finland, and not China , Mongolia or Central Asia. And that kind of contradicts what you just wrote. 

And by the way, this has been the case since like the end of World war 1 till today. I guess you could argue that in 1930's their biggest danger was to the West, with Hitler and everything, but after WW2, that argument collapses since Americans and NATO never really planned to attack Russia (then USSR), while the Red army put their Western borders full of tanks and artillery guns (outnumbering Western forces with like 3:1 ratio). It really seems to me that they were more concerned with aggression towards the West, than the actual defense of their nation. Their military exercises were also very aggressive, and not at all defensive in nature. 

That hasnt changed even today, I doubt the big expensive army Russia currently sustains, is just for defense and national security.

576,"&gt;Plenty of elected governments have nationalized industries in the past, no reason the couldn't nationalize them  

Few problems with this - one is that attempts to nationalise industry is often fiercely opposed by the capitalist class, another is that nationalisation is basically the same as capitalism. It’s still wage labour, still exploitation and it’s known as social democracy when it occurs within capitalism. Social democracy doesn’t change anything.  

If everything is nationalised and ruled by a state then it’s known as State-Capitalism (basically how the USSR / Cuba was / is run).  

 &gt;and then put worker councils or whatever in charge.  

So then what would be the point in the state?  

&gt;Because in a proper democracy and you can choose your leaders  

You’re just choosing a different colour tie.  

&gt;How would you make the state useless?  

Feeding and sheltering the homeless, using up waste food and empty buildings, organising community healthcare, credit unions, environment protection, community protection. Stuff like that.  

&gt;There are MPs in our Parliament who want to get rid of capitalism, so I don't really see this brutality you mention.  

No they don’t. They aren’t real revolutionaries. There are some who want to represent poor people a little bit more, but they don’t pose any existential threat to the powers that be. Look up the J20 protestors.

How *would* they oppress the weak? With what state apparatus? And who would be strong and who would be weak? We’d all be on an equal footing.

633,"Hi!

I think this is the standard ""The people have spoken"" argument deployed against Remainers. However, several counterarguments have been presented to this, as I presume you are aware. One, of course, is that the June 2016 referendum was troubled in various ways: key arguments used by the Leave side turned out to be unfounded, suffrage was controversially denied to certain groups, and so on. Another one is that the people never spoke on what kind of a Brexit they might want. If the three broad options are ""Hard Brexit"", ""Soft Brexit"" and ""No Brexit"", the plurality - recent polling data suggests the majority - is behind ""No Brexit"". The arguments on both sides have been enunciated endlessly for the past 18 months, and I'm more convinced by the Remain side's argument. 

Of course, the movement to stop Brexit wants to do that with a mandate from the Parliament and/or the people directly. When this is considered, the Remain side now has a strong argument: ""We want a proper democratic vote, and now you're trying to block it - don't you want to hear what the will of the people is once they have been provided with an indication of what Brexit might look like / once they know the terms on which Britain would leave the EU?""

673,"&gt;Russia becoming a democracy can change everything. For one thing, the chance of war will drastically lower because democracies have a much harder time starting a war against another democracy



Russia also has nuke so the chances are already super low




&gt;Also, it gives the West a real good reason to start making relations better (making concessions) and change the way NATO is if Russia ceased to be a threat




you mean like Russia did in the 1990s? And what did they get? More Nato members near their borders





&gt;Which is a very likely outcome of becoming a democracy, not because they lose power, but because the economies of Russia and the west can be intertwined much like that of Germany and France, which will make war rather impossible.





Germany's largest trading partner before ww1 was the UK and Russia's largest trading partner at the moment is the Eu and this still doesn't address the fact that Russia has an independent foreign policy that doesn't always match up with the west's and no becoming a democracy will not mean that suddenly Russia will stop being allies with Syria or supporting Cuba or selling weapons to China





&gt;And this is just complete bullshit, UK has a much, much better relation with Germany. Brexit did change a lot in the relation, but Germany and UK are both in NATO, the Saudis aren't. I dare you to find any influential German or British politician that agrees with you. If Merkel or May has to choose between the other or Saudi, we both know who they would choose.





the politicians say whatever the hell they wanna say it's irrelevant the relations between the Germans and the Brits have soured massively due to the Brexit negotiations while the same cannot be said of relations with the Saudis which have not changed at all. And being in Nato matters very little, The Turks and the Greeks have never been friendly with each other yet are both Nato members. and if May and Merkel were given the choice between the other or King Salman they'd choice whoever gave them an advantage, As I can assure both would pick King Salman over the democratically elected Prime Minster of Luxembourg.

713,"""As the Guardian’s online religious editor Andrew Brown has pointed out, counterjihadist
websites promote a ‘rolling cauldron of stories from all over the world to
illustrate the treachery and violence of Muslims, and the criminal weakness of liberals’.6
They also provide ammunition for neo-Nazis and violent ultrapatriotic defence
leagues (such as the EDL), which, in turn, run thousands of websites. (In Germany
alone, far-right groups run some 1,000 websites and thirty-eight online radio stations.7)
The views promoted by counter-jihadists and neo-Nazis are also nourished
by movements such as Stop Islamisation of Europe (SIOE) and Stop Islamization of
America (SIOA), run by Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer, which bears the motto
‘Racism is the lowest form of human stupidity, but Islamophobia is the height of
common sense’. Breivik declared himself in favour of the Stop Islamisation movements
and also mentioned in positive terms the True Finns (several of whose members
were sent the manifesto by Breivik), the British National Party (BNP) and, in Germany,
the National Democratic party, the Deutsche Volksunion and the Republikaner.
(Tanguy Veys, a Vlaams Belang MP, was also sent a copy of the manifesto.) The
leader of the Dutch Freedom party, Geert Wilders, was cited in Breivik’s manifesto
on thirty occasions. He commented that Wilders was a possible ally, although Wilders
would ‘have to condemn us’ (at the point of violence), ‘which is fine. It is after all
essential that they protect their reputational shields.’""...

...""The first aspect of the ‘theory’ that Breivik draws upon is that Islam is a backward,
warlike and criminal religion and that Muslims, through sheer force of numbers
and back-door attempts to introduce Sharia, are bent on Islamising Europe. Under
such reasoning, Islam the religion and political Islam are collapsed, and the history
of the Crusades is served up as a horror story warning of the conquest to come.
The most fanatical of those who fall for the conspiracy theory seriously believe that
the circumstances today are exactly the same as during the Crusades, only, at that
time, Christian Europe was under threat from war and occupation, whereas today
the threat comes from the Muslim demographic and rising Muslim birth rates. Thus,
in a footnote to 2083, Breivik explained the significance of the date 2083, which is
400 years since the last siege of Vienna by the Turks. He then went on to quote
Henryk M. Broder, who wrote that: ‘After the defeats of Poitiers (732) and Vienna
(1683), the Europeans are now defeated with the weapons of demography.’15 In
postings on the Norwegian internet site Dokument.no,16 Breivik wrote:
Show me a country where Muslims have lived at peace with non-Muslims without
waging Jihad against the Kaffir (dhimmitude, systematic slaughter or demographic
warfare)? Can you please give me ONE single example where Muslims
have been successfully assimilated? How many thousands of Europeans must
die, how many hundreds of European women must be raped, millions robbed
and bullied before you realise that multiculturalism and Islam cannot work?17""...

..."" They draw on the clash of civilisations thesis, which is associated with a
group of American academics (including Bernard Lewis and Samuel Huntington),
who, from the 1990s onwards, wrote a series of essays in support of American and
Israeli foreign policy goals in the Middle East.42 Bernard Lewis – who went on to
develop the ‘new anti-Semitism’ thesis (see below) – used the term ‘Muslim rage’
to denote the supposedly essentialist elements of the modern Arab psyche. Using
pseudo-psychology as political analysis, Lewis suggested that the backwardness
of Arab culture and economy was leading to feelings of enmity and rage directed
at American, Israeli and European targets. Lewis’s essay ‘The roots of Muslim
rage’ was then taken up by Samuel Huntington, who, in a seminal piece in Foreign
Affairs (summer 1993), argued that, with the cold war over, world politics had
entered a new phase in which the fundamental source of conflict was not primarily
ideological or economic, but cultural, with ‘the principal conflicts of global politics’
occurring between nations and groups from different civilisations""...

...""The Eurabia theory, in the hands of Geert Wilders, continues the view, articulated
in 1968 by Enoch Powell in his ‘Rivers of blood’ speech, that aggressive minorities
are out to dominate the majority. Hence, Wilders warns of Islamisation via conquest,
and conquest through immigration. In many ways, the descriptions of Eurabia
parallel classic criticisms of Jews within anti-Semitism – ironic given that the four
frameworks identified here are tied up with unqualified support for the state of
Israel, the last line of defence against Islamisation...""

""The parallels with anti-Semitism are underlined forcefully by Matt Carr, who
points out that Jews in Victorian Britain were thought to harbour a secret ambition
to subvert, dominate and possess. Carr also points out that, ‘the fear of cultural
and racial extinction has a long pedigree in European history’, traceable back to
the ‘racial Darwinism of the nineteenth century, and articulated by writers such
as Count Joseph-Arthur de Gobineau, who argued that only races that maintained
their racial purity would survive’ – only, today, the Eurabia-ists substitute culture
and civilisation for race."".",Earth,/r/europe/comments/7nvfbh/the_internet_and_protocol_of_the_elders_of_zion_20/ds4qny2/,Tavirio,1514994586

The social and economic effects of those were, in many ways, a much bigger surprise, but even that's not really the strange stuff.  People had already been experimenting with self-winding clock-work carts for a long time.  If I recall right da Vinci even designed one  that was finally constructed a few years ago and it worked.  Greeks had underwater breathing systems, you couldn't stay down long, but they had them.

Jules Verne, and others, had good ideas that gave people who were familiar with his work some of the tools they needed to *think* about the new future they found themselves in.  Also, even Jules Verne drew on older things, in some cases *much* older (see examples above).

The mistake people seem to be making here is assuming that science fiction and other things are making predictions, accurate ones or not, but that's completely missing the point.  It's not at all about making a prediction, it's about training people's expectations and opening people's minds about *how to think* about both the present and the future in ways that were not so widespread in previous times.

777,"&gt; I'm not going to claim the number is exactly right, but it isn't far off.

My claim at this point is that essentially zero number crunching or serious thought was given to the number. The point was not ""to get a certain number""; the point was to get all males into the army.

&gt; The idea is that if a person in the active reserve gets injured, dies, moves abroad permanently and never participates in training with their unit etc. they can be replaced with a person with a similar training. So while in an ideal world you might be able to train fewer people that would all magically fit their roles perfectly and never have any hindrance to serving with their respective units later in life, that just isn't realistic in practice.

Well, Sweden and Norway did crunch the numbers; they gave it some thought and decided on an actual number they needed and if they don't make that number from volunteers only then do they start conscripting.

&gt; You keep bringing up violent crime like it's a huge issue in Finland. It's true that the murder rate in Finland is more than double compared with that of, say, Denmark, but the absolute numbers are tiny (118 in Finland (2010) vs 47 in Denmark (2009). While I don't know what the exact costs of this are to society, I can't think of a way that it could be even in the same ballpark as a professional military.

There is more than just murder; murder was an indication of the higher amount of violence in finland—people get beaten up more, more domestic violence, more robberies and all that; more suicides and other mental health problems and then the estimate remains that all those people who got conscripted are earning about 5-10% less right now than they would without conscription. Imagine if Finland's GDP would just increase by 4% without conscription; that can go directly to the military.

&gt; Sweden has tried the professional defense force model and there's a reason why they're backtracking on it.

Sweden's system is pragmatic; while they officially have conscription this is close to how the Netherlands officially has conscription; they will only conscript when they can't fill the quota with professional volunteers and thusfar they've always met the quota. It's a failsafe measure that in practice is not called upon.",The European flag is phallic as seen from above.,/r/europe/comments/7nmdpn/this_should_settle_the_rivalry_in_the_reurope/ds4r7gq/,alaplaceducalife,1514995180

Your 1869 photo is more representative of dress 50 years before it was taken. You could say it's a photo of what the urban classes _wanted_ their peasantry to look like. The ""folkedrakt"" had gone out of fashion in the early 18th century, only to be revived a few decades later, not as peasant everyday wear but by people who, in the nationalistic spirit of the time, basically took a snapshot of what the fashion was just before industrialization (but only from places that had a particularly distinct style of dress, which was far from everywhere) and decided to raise it up to the definition of what ""traditional clothing"" was and gave it the status it has to this day, as if it'd been an ancient and unchanging native style of dress, when the broad strokes of them were common European dress of the 1700s. 

It really is a bit weird we've now worn them as 'traditional clothing' for a longer period than they were used originally. I guess the best way to create a tradition is to claim it already is one.

965,"Are you getting your one million potential victims figure from a daily mirror interview with an MP? I can’t post it because the Mirror is blocked on the sub.

&gt; “There are hundreds of thousands and *I think* there could be up to a million victims of exploitation nationwide”

1/65th of the UK’s population being groomed by ethnic minorities? Uh. I can easily see that being the case for the total number of children suffering from abuse. Does the UK have a problem with Pakistani grooming gangs? Yes, and the Rotherham scandal was shocking and a massive police failure, but it’s a disservice to victims to suggest grooming gangs are the only problem. Hell, a home office report from 2013 says:

https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmhaff/68/6806.htm

&gt; The vast majority of convicted child-sex offenders in the UK are single White men. However, with this specific model of offending, there is a widespread perception that the majority of perpetrators are of Asian, British Asian or Muslim origin. This would certainly seem to be the case from the major grooming prosecutions which have gone to court so far, but in fact both CEOP and the Office of the Children's Commissioner have found serious inconsistencies with recording of ethnicities and gender of both victims and perpetrators across UK forces.[238] Given the number of child sexual exploitation cases which have so far failed to make it to court, for the reasons discussed, this highly unsatisfactory situation means that it is extremely difficult to form an evidence based opinion on the true nature of what is still a largely hidden crime. Nevertheless, the perception, that grooming perpetrators are largely of Asian, British Asian or Muslim origin colours the attitudes of those working in the field, as well as the media and the wider public. Ann Cryer, the former MP for Keighley, who raised concerns about localised grooming in her constituency as long ago as 2003, faced a backlash when she described the offenders as Asian and pointed to the fact that most of them came from the Mirpur district of Kashmir (a description which she still stands by).[239] She suggested that underlying cultural attitudes might be a factor in the offending. 

To be frank I’m not seeing how this is in any way comparable to genocide unless you’re suggesting there’s a large part of the minority population that’s intent on raping white children/women on a massive scale and we’re all blind to it. I’m glad the police have started doing their jobs at any rate.

1214,"&gt; Here is a list of some Pompeii inscriptions. I will point out examples containing the dative:

Well, all those inscriptions are unmistakable _classical Latin_.

I'm not sure what would make those vulgar; I'm not seeing a remote trace of it; I assume those were just random writings on the wall done in classical Latin which they also wrote unless you've anything to find which marks them as vulgar?

&gt; Hall also posits a dative case for Proto-Romance, citing the fact that it survives in Romanian to this very day (the territory of Romania was colonized by Latin-speaking settlers multiple generations after Pompeii).

Well I finally looked up this Hall and this is a book apparently from 1950 and honestly I find this alone kind of weird and would love ot see the reconstructive methofs becuase:

- the Romanian genitive/dative derives from the Latin genitive, not the dative.
- the features of Romanian and retension of the case system which features  a strengthening of the vocative and repurpose of the genitive as dative is almost surely a function of the Balkan sprachbund  where merged of dative/genitive is [almost universal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_sprachbund#Grammatical_features)

Apart from that Vulgar Latin was a dialect continuum rather than a single language but I find prima facie the idea that because Romanian has a productive dative this leads to a reconstruction in retention of the dative in vulgar Latin to be absurd since the dative in Romanian is an innovation rather than a conservation.

&gt; Well I finally looked up this Hall and this is a book apparently from 1950 and honestly I find this alone kind of weird and would love ot see the reconstructive methofs becuase:

Hall is a specialist in the exact topic we're discussing. He has published countless meticulously researched material on Proto-Romance and other Romance Linguistic topics, and his works are very much authoritative in the field to this day. ''Proto-Romance phonology'' - 1978 and Proto-Romance Morphology: Comparative Romance Grammar - 1984 are the main ones I would recommend if you want to learn about the subject.

If you think he's outdated, I welcome you to find a mainstream Romance Linguistics work more recent than his that contradicts any of the conclusions made here.

Interestingly enough, it wasn't the hyperinflation of the twenties that brought the nazis in power (their coup at that time failed). Hitler got to power at a time of deflation, when prices were falling. 

Deflation can be as bad if not worse than hyperinflation but it doesn't strike the memories the same way to say ""prices were fallong which caused wages to fall and mass unemployment"" compared to saying ""your grandpa used to take bags of money just to buy groceries"".

And I take issue with the idea that blood is trivial: obviously someone whose ancestors have lived in Europe for millennia has a greater personal connection to its civilization and history than a 2nd generation immigrant. 

Without this connection to a nation, its history and its culture, what incentive is there to maintain it? If you don’t feel a personal stake in your nation beyond liking the fact that it’s economically prosperous (as migrants would tend to see it), than what incentive is there to preserve these things? 

Sure, some are idealistic enough to abandon their ancestral culture and adopt western values, but they won’t have any personal connection to the culture from which they arose. Their adoption of the new culture would be merely a cold assessment of values, and it would be completely divorced from the tradition, history, and ethnic kinship that organically conceived the culture in the first place. 

It’s a cold and empty vision for the future: culture and nationhood reduced to commodities for people to select at a whim. “Oh, I like French culture, it’s so intriguing! I’m French now!

Bases that are only relevant in the context of EE. There is nothing that happens in Germany that can't be done elsewhere-especially freed of that obligation. 

&gt;ho was the only one who called for mutual defense and got Europeans killed for wars they started

That was an abuse of Article 5. There is no question. Though acting as if most of you did more than show up is a little disingenuous. 

&gt; who has their companies make full use of the privileges in Europe?

Idk what this even means. The U.S. isn't China; European and other companies can invest and divest here as they please, with minor exceptions that wouldn't include anyone in Europe outside of Russia.

&gt;Also the U.S is one of China's biggest clients, so this insinuation of ""enabling"" them is hypocritical.

We have been acting foolishly with respect to them for too long. The hope was that their ascension into the WTO would encourage them to open up their markets, at minimum. That plan failed. China is tightening its grip on its markets, not reducing it, and using the increased access that it received as a WTO member to put every other member at a disadvantage.

A new approach is needed. 

&gt;what you forget is that the US has now threatened Mexico, Canada, most of South America, Europe, China, Australia, India, Pakistan and part of the Middle East

And what all of them except the high-and-mighty Europeans realize is that Trump will be gone in a few years. NAFTA remains the single largest trade bloc in the world. Australia, as much as they dislike Trump, realizes the threat that China poses to its own economy and political system. India is probably the only country not named Israel with better relations under Trump than Obama-not because of Trump, but again because of China.

There are no excuses for Trump, but he has been a useful litmus for revealing the deep antipathy among many of our so-called transatlantic allies for us. 

&gt;Honestly, I think you lot have more to lose than us with a change in Status Quo.

That's because the knee-jerk hate on your side of the pond is blinding you to the fact the status quo has worked better for Europe (particularly the West) than is has for just about anyone else. American policy has been to keep the eurozone stable and strengthen it as a military partner; the world will look very different when you have a U.S. and Russia both incentivized to sow chaos in the region. 

I think that a U.S. unburdened by propping up a hostile and ungrateful WE by doing its job for it in EE has many more options once this is no longer happening. But that does not change the fact that coordinate efforts to combat China's mercantiist policies are best for everyone.

&gt;Also as a final, is there a point in any co-operation when the US and Russia are already plotting together?

Fucking European hypocrisy and condescension at its finest.

You bunch were *literally* building warships for the Russians before Ukraine, and had to be browbeaten and shamed into not delivering them, even after MH 17 was shot down. 

The former German PM is *literally* the chairman of *Rosneft*. 

You are *literally* pushing a new pipeline that will bring more Russian gas to your markets in a manner that bypasses your so-called partners in EE. 

This is not hyperbole; it is not wild conjecture. These things are facts. And then you have the nerve to claim that *we* are somehow conspiring with Russia?

The idea that it's us collaborating with Russia is a prime example of how blind emotion clouds the judgment of so many of you.

&gt; “The blood test, for example, has an accuracy of about 3.75 years over a whole age population, meaning that from newborns up to about 91 years of age our accuracy was about 3.75,” said Bekaert. “The younger the individual is the higher the accuracy is because it has had less influence of the environment. So the more a person has an influence over the environment on his epigenome, as we call it, so the chemical structures on the genome the larger the error rate will become. So the error rate __for younger people is about two years of age, while for 91 years of age it will be about five and a half, six, years of age.__”

This is the _average_ error rate, not the upper bound so I find your claim of ""aren't off more than a year"" in your own source to de disputable.

1380,"Here is a [list](http://www.orbilat.com/Languages/Latin_Vulgar/Texts/Pompeii_Graffiti.html) of some Pompeii inscriptions. I will point out examples containing the dative:

&gt; **Puteolanis** felicia, **omnibus Nucerinis** felicia et uncum **Pompeianis Petecusanis**.

.

&gt; Luci Istacidi, at quem non ceno, barbarus ille **mihi** est.

.

&gt; Virgula **Tertio suo**: indecens es.

Note the absence of any examples of ''dative'' ad + noun. That construction certainly existed (as far back as Plautus) and may well have been growing in use by the time Pompeii was buried, but in the speech of Pompeiians we observe the old dative still dominating.

-----

While we're at it, there are even examples of neuter nouns on that page:

&gt; **Suspirium** puellarum Celadus thraex.

.

&gt; **Lucrum** **gaudium**

.

&gt; Cacator cave **malum**, aut si contempseris, habeas Iovem iratum.

In any case Robert Hall's reconstruction of Proto-Romance does posit a neuter case. Pompeii is clearly far too early a period for a collapse of the neuter gender. In fact, given the various ways it survives in Romance (even today in Italian uovo/uova ''egg/eggs'' &lt; L. ovum/ova, or collective nouns like legna) it may have come quite a while later.

Hall also posits a dative case for Proto-Romance, citing the fact that it survives in Romanian to this very day (the territory of Romania was colonized by Latin-speaking settlers multiple generations after Pompeii).

---

I'm not seeing any uses of 'a' meaning a(d) at all in Pompeiian graffiti. The instances of a all seem to mean a(b) as in ''away from''.

Here are examples with ad:

&gt; Nucerea quaeres **ad** Porta Romana, in vico Venerio, Novelliam Primigeniam.

Note spelling mistake (should be portam romanam). Despite that, the d in ad is retained.

&gt; Stercorari **ad** murum progredere, si presus pueris poena patiare necese est. Cave.

.

&gt; Quisquis me **ad** cenam vocarit v(aleat).

----

That wiki page on Vulgar Latin is, in my opinion, in serious need of a revamp.

That said, right there in the intro it claims:

&gt; Nevertheless up to the 4th and 5th centuries AD, the most widely spoken dialects were still similar to and mostly mutually intelligible with Classical Latin.

You can also think about studying in the UK. Even though the tuition is expensive as fuck, many Romanians go there for college and take a [student loan](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance). I don't know how it works for non-EU students, but you can check it out.

1480,"Look, let's [compare](https://imgur.com/a/PzmMa) four Nordic countries to keep it nice.

The worst-performing countries are Finland, that experienced a wonderful double-dip recession inside our merry Euroland, and Denmark, whose currency is pegged to the euro.

Now, even though Iceland had the deepest slump also considering that the liabilities amassed by its three leading banks amounted to 800% of its GDP (over which Iceland defaulted), it is currently outperforming the second-best country of the group, namely Sweden.

The second chart shows the extent of the exchange rate adjustment in relation to the euro: at their peak, the Icelandic and Swedish kronas depreciated 260% and 20% respectively.

In the case of Iceland such a sharp adjustment led to a physiological rise in its inflation rate, which was nevertheless an order of magnitude lower than the depreciation rate.

*Addendum*: Moreover, a period of an above-target inflation rate accompanied by a strong economic growth is exactly what you want to reduce the [debt-to-GDP ratio](https://imgur.com/a/BHsa5) which meanwhile had spiked as a consequence of the anti-cyclical stabilisation mechanism.

The stark contrast between the booming Iceland and Greece, that *de facto* lost its sovereignty and whose economic depression reminds a country in wartime even though its problems--which the euro had [in large part created](https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/7k67jq/heartbreaking_letter_to_santa_greek_child_asks/drch8x0/)--were much smaller than Iceland's, shows the irrationality, noxiousness and abomination of the European project since the Maastricht Treaty.

Economists had warned with [plenty of notice](https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6p7rkv/fasten_seat_belts_europe_is_unsafe_at_any_speed/dkn935y/) of the unsustainability of an arrangement which removes adjustment mechanisms for economic shocks or divergent competitiveness levels, but, of course, the European elite knew better.",It'll all be 0K in the end,/r/europe/comments/7nnx31/the_interest_rate_of_the_first_10year_bond_each/ds3zbag/,In_der_Tat,1514947070

&gt;That's not really the case though—it's a bit of a segregated community with their own traditions in many things and many own holidays that aren't celebrated by the rest of Finland but are in Sweden.



Firstly, it's not one ""community"". Yes, it's a minority group that has it's own identity (and everything that comes with it), but not one big community. The Swedish speaking Finns in Helsinki metropolitan area are very different from the Swedish speaking Finns in Northern Ostrobothnia, and you can bet your ass they are culturally closer to Finnish-speaking Finns in Helsinki than Swedish speaking Finns there (also the ""segregated""-part doesn't apply in Helsinki if you mean not mixing with Finnish-speaking Finns, overall the term ""segregated"" is just wrong because it implies that they are isolated from the rest of the country, when Swedish is the second official language seen everywhere and Swedish-speaking Finns have been and still are incredibly influential and major players in creating the thing we know as Finland today). Second, there is one (1) holiday that is mostly celebrated by the Swedish speaking Finns, and that is Saint Lucia's day. However, everyone located in the metropolitan area can participate in the celebrations if they want to, since the crowning of the Lucia maiden takes place in the Helsinki cathedral and afterwards there is a parade through the city. Also, i.e school children celebrate Lucia's day (both Finnish and Swedish speaking) and it is not restricted to only Swedish speaking schools. So calling that a holiday that Finns don't celebrate is false. 


The second tradition that can be called something that Finns don't celebrate is the crayfish parties, however that is not a holiday. And that's it.


But please, tell me more about what is the ""really the case"" here (especially correcting u/Normanbombardini who was a refreshing exception in this subject). Your confidence in your knowledge on Finland is admirable, and I def have enjoyed reading your educative and respectful opinions about Finland before.

1581,"&gt; Did my_honor_demands_it get banned?

Not at all—I just get a new account every so often because reddit doesn't allow name changes.

&gt; Firstly, it's not one ""community"". The Swedish speaking Finns in Helsinki metropolitan area are very different from the Swedish speaking Finns in Northern Ostrobothnia, and you can bet your ass they are culturally closer to Finnish-speaking Finns in Helsinki than Swedish speaking Finns there (also the ""segregated""-part doesn't apply in Helsinki). Second, there is one (1) holiday that is mostly celebrated by the Swedish speaking Finns, and that is Saint Lucia's day. However, everyone located in the metropolitan area can participate in the celebrations if they want to, since the crowning of the Lucia maiden takes place in the Helsinki cathedral and afterwards there is a parade through the city. Also, i.e school children celebrate Lucia's day (both Finnish and Swedish speaking) and it is not restricted to only Swedish speaking schools. So calling that a holiday that Finns don't celebrate is false.

&gt; The second tradition that can be called something that Finns don't celebrate is the crayfish parties, however that is not a holiday. And that's it.

To be honest I'm not sure how what you say here contradicts my post nor do I really disagree with it.

&gt; and I def have enjoyed reading your educative and respectful opinions about Finland before.

Oh don't act like I single Finland out—reading back in this topic alone I have in descending order:

- said the Flemish were horrible people who smile too much with no punctuality and too much respect for authority.
- said the Twents and Groningers were horrible
- said Dutch culture and any culture is horrible
- called Finnish conscription a form of sexist military slavery that just serves as a patchwork to make it seem like gender inequality is less than it is.

Did you read the program of HZDS from 1992? There are explicit requirements for sovereignty, own constitution and international legal status of the Slovak Republic. A federation is not composed of sovereign states. 

In the program is written:

&gt;To vyžaduje pretvoriť terajší federálny zväzok Slovenskej republiky a Českej republiky na zväzok suverénnych republík s vlastnou medzinárodno-právnou subjektivitou. (This requires to transform present federal union of the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic into a union of sovereign republic with own international legal subjectivity. ) 

What more do you need to be writen to declare a
""premise of abolishing the common state""?

1898,"&gt; So we should all just become rootless people in a bland, sterile and homogenised culture with no variation between the peoples of Earth whatsoever?

I like how people think that ""culture"" is what breeds variety.

It breeds the opposite. What culture creates is different bland homogenous places next to each other where all the people are the same and next to it is another bland place where all the people are the same in a different way.

""culture"" is a fancy way of saying ""I feel the need to do things and believe things purely because my parents did it.""; it creates homogeneity. 

&gt; Europe has some of the richest cultural heritage on the planet, putting it all to the torch because of what happened in the 1930s is either the philosophy of a philistine or a madman.

Okay, here's a better argument:

Torch it all because it's fucking stupid to continue with ""traditions"" just because ""that's how we always did it"" even when it makes no sense. Actions should have merit on their own self.

Following traditions is the hallmark of a fool.

&gt; Culture and identity gives us meaning, a connection to those who came before us

What does this even _mean_? This is like the vaguest non-falsifiable statement ever.

&gt; a motivation to strive for those who come after

Oh yeah because countries that are strongly patriotic don't have this habit of fucking the environment over for those after them.

&gt; Without them we'd be little more than soulless automatons existing only to consume and die.

Oh yeah I forget; I don't have a conscious mind any more because I don't do stupid shit just because ""that's how it was always done""—no, that doesn't make sense.

&gt; The cultures and traditions of all humanity deserve to be preserved and protected, this shouldn't need to be stated.

No they don't; stupid actions that serve no purpose should be eliminated and ""We have always done it"" is not a justification to keep bullshit alive.

Il est à ce titre le repas le plus consommé en France1, seul pays où les parts de marché du sandwich ne chutent pas face à celles du hamburger. Les Français achètent annuellement 830 millions de jambon-beurre, soit plus de 2,2 millions par jour, ce qui représentent 72 % de la consommation nationale totale des « sandwiches baguette », eux-mêmes couvrant 64 % de la consommation totale de sandwiches en France.

Equivalent barriers are still warranted, though. People can harp all they want, but the fact is that the Chinese cheat like fiends and are heavily-reliant on this system and on exports to fuel their rise and ambitions.

Imagine the differences between cultures and traditions is erased, and Italy and France would feel the same to me as Austria, Germany or Sweden. It would be a ""meh"" travel destination from that perspective, it would loose its originality and the only thing that would remain original is geographic location. Traveling for the purpose of seeing a place is only half fulfilling as experiencing a unique culture. You Americans don't experience it as much. Yes, there are some differences between individual US states, even more so on the individual city districts that have varios communities (China town etc...), but it's still not that distinct to what we experience in Europe.

2027,"&gt;Batteries are not too expensive, even right now the costs is about 0,15€ per kwh if you use 50% of the battery capacity daily for 10 years.

That's not a realistic price for unsubsidised battery storage.

According to Bloomberg, battery costs now are around $500 per KWH, in bulk, installed (with the necessary ancillary hardware etc)

So per KWH, assuming 50% use per day, that's 183 KWH delivered per year. Over 20 years, that's 3,650 KWH.

However, batteries aren't 100% efficient. At 90%, that's 3,285 KWH delivered. That works out at 15c per KWH.

However, that ignores interest, maintenance, assumes a 20 year life, and ignores the cost of the energy wasted in charging.

If you assume 5% interest a year, it more than doubles the cost. Add in maintenance, charging costs etc and the price is closer to 50c per KWH.

And that's just the cost of storing the electricity. You have to generate it in the first place. In comparison, Hinkley is 9.5p per KWH including generation. 

The price comparison is much worse if you assume a small scale battery installation.

&gt;And that price will decrease further in the coming years.

A bit. According to Lazard, the price could decline ""up to"" 36% over the next 5 years. But that still makes the price much, much too high.

&gt;From 2010 to 2016 the prices have dropped by over 70% to 273€/kWh.* And that will continue. 

Not at that rate it won't. As with any industry, prices fall as production increases, but not at the same rate, and not forever. Battery prices are projected to decline much more slowly in future.

&gt;And if Elon Musk is to believed, Teslas batteries cost 190€/kWh.

Possibly for the cell cost alone. But add in the inverters, installation, maintenance, planning permissions, grid connections etc and the price is much higher. And the price for the installation etc is likely to remain the same, or even increase, in future. 

More important, the reason for lower prices is insufficient demand. From your link:

&gt;Oversupply is depressing battery prices. Passenger EV sales were lower than expected in 2011 - H1 2015, meaning demand for lithium-ion batteries was low. The manufacturing industry suffered - and is still suffering - from oversupply. To increase utilisation, manufacturers have been lowering prices and competing fiercely with one another.

Here's the problem. World lithium battery production is about 80 GWH a year. World car production is about 90 million a year. We'd need to increase battery production by more than 110 times to meet demand if all cars went electric.

If we want to use batteries for the grid as well, we need a lot more battery production. The UK would need 8 TWH of batteries to overcome a typical winter wind lull. The world uses about 60 times as much electricity as the UK. That's another 480 TWH of batteries, say 48 TWH a year. That's another 600 times current battery production.

In other words, if batteries do become cheap enough for grid use, we need to increase battery production by more than 700 times current levels. But if demand is that high, how can prices fall?

The reality is batteries cannot become cheap enough for widespread grid use because demand would increase much faster than supply (indeed, getting enough lithium and cobalt for that many batteries would probably be impossible). 

&gt;Yes the total output does drop, but not by 75%, only by about 25%. So simply said: During winter, you get wind energy.

But the total of the two varies hugely. If you look at 2013, wind and solar produced 3.9 TWH in Feb, 8.1 TWH in Dec. In 2014 7.8 TWH in Feb, 4.8 in Nov. 

4 TWH of battery storage would be $2 trillion. That's more than $24,000 per person in Germany. And that's when renewables provide less than 40% of German electricity. Double the amount of wind and solar and the required battery storage doubles. Can Germany afford to spend $50,000 per person on batteries? The idea is absurd.

Batteries are not the answer for balancing intermittent renewables, which is why gas infrastructure is being expanded so much. The reality is when the sun sets or the wind drops we will have to turn up the gas. That costs money and keeps emissions high. Nuclear works out cheaper than a combination of wind/solar/gas, and has much lower emissions.

This is a completely different matter and we weren't discussing about this, so I won't bother answering to that.

&gt; You know why they moved their headquarters? Because they want to be sure they won't be left out if someone decides to, i dunno, declare independence overnight over a sham result of an illegal referendum.

Then explain why exactly zero foreign companies decided to move HQs. Some companies (namely Seat) even denounced pressures by the Spanish government to move HQs. Come on, it's pretty obvious that this whole move is just a play to make it seem like an independent Catalonia is not viable economically. 

And sham result of a referendum? Sorry? The elections two weeks ago got more pro-independence votes than the referendum (without even counting Catalunya en Comú which has a percentage of pro-independence votes), how can you justify that? The referendum was perfectly valid and the incidences were minimal and did not affect the result at all.

&gt; You may not know this but if we split, we won't have access to the EU free market, on which a lot of companies depend on;

Nobody can really know what will happen with certainty. However the fact that many companies have said that they are not worried about a Catalan republic, and the fact that Catalonia is growing very fast economically leads me to believe that this will not be a problem and that the EU will agree to some kind of deal to keep the Catalan market (they won't risk giving such a gift to other world powers like China or Russia).

Cheaper when you use more per day, more expensive when you use less per day.

And that price will decrease further in the coming years.

From 2010 to 2016 the prices have dropped by over 70% to 273€/kWh.* And that will continue. And if Elon Musk is to believed, Teslas batteries cost 190€/kWh.

From the same document the price is expected to drop to below 100€/kWh in ~2030 which means a cost of storing energy will be about 0,05€ per kWh used (again under the 50% usage per day assumption)

2207,"&gt;Calling US cities a slum is not exactly accurate.

Something being a slum is subjective. What amounts to slum in Northern Europe, might be perfectly acceptable in Eastern Europe. Just as a slum in the US would be paradise compared to a shantytown in the developing world. Which in turn is a marked improvement over the rural areas of that country, that's why the shanty exists, after all.

And compared to any Northern European city - with the possible exception of Malmö - DC is a very rough town.

I don't get why people are getting their panties in a twist about this. American urban planners know that the automotive city was a mistake and are working their asses off to rectify it.

Being built in the American way since 1970s is precisely what is wrong with Helsinki. Urban sprawl has pushed industry so far away from the city proper, that the only thing that the city produces is paperwork.

And paperwork isn't going to be a source of income for a person nor a city for much longer, software bots are coming. Spelling doom for the cubicle-rats.

When the doom arrives, cities that live off bureaucracy both public and private, will be in deep shit. Cities that have proper industry, will survive however.

2212,"&gt;There's 1 thing i'm certain of though, building new nuclear powerplants like Hinkely Point in the UK is a massive waste of money. 20 billion for a plant that people hope will run for 60 years, while i expect only 15 years where it can compete with solar.

Solar produces very little power in northern Europe in the winter. It produces none at all in the evenings, when power demand is highest.

If you have solar producing 20 GW of power on a summer's day, in the evening it will drop to zero. What do you turn on to replace it? 

The reality for most countries is you have to turn on coal, gas, maybe biomass. All have very high emissions. 

Nuclear power will generate 20 GW in the day and 20 GW in the evening. You don't have to burn things, polluting the atmosphere, when the sun starts to go down in the evening.

You also don't have to pay for the coal/gas/biomass power plant to sit idle all day, ready to run in the evening. Hinkley C, when it opens, will enable the UK to close 3.2 GW of coal/gas/biomass power stations. That's 3.2 GW of power stations that will no longer pollute the atmosphere and no longer consume subsidies.",,/r/europe/comments/7new1p/new_record_385_of_germanys_electricity_in_2017/ds2ochr/,WhiteSatanicMills,1514886636

You will quickly see that you won't have acess to capital nor productive workers. The inputs every succesful company need. Hence you will offer poorer services and be driven out of competition. It is no coincidence that profit oriented companies does better in this industry. It is highly competitive and the economic rents are pretty much zero.

What he identifies as reason was just the literal drop that made the barrel overflow. To make that very clear: I am against secession. And still, I don't buy the explanation of this man. For he belongs to the real originators. The deeper roots are: 1) The centralist attitude of the ruling PP (PSOE and C's in tow, royals in the background) who collectively denied for decades reforms of the post-Franco constitution and the stipulation of a ""referendo pactado"" (similar to Quebéc, Canada, where the Clarity Act curbed the appetite for secession).  2) Rajoy's party is to the top edge of the lower lip immersed in corruption ([-&gt; 60 cases with PP politicians since 2013](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Casos_judiciales_relacionados_con_corrupci%C3%B3n_pol%C3%ADtica_en_Espa%C3%B1a)), so that a civil conflict (some say war) to distract from that fact is welcome in order to muster an anxious Spanish majority behind his back and remain in power.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7nl6tk/catalonia_crisis_economy_minister_puts_cost_at_1bn/ds2onnf/,Esquina1,1514887499

How will CETA open up the Canadian services market?

In services and investment CETA is the most far reaching agreement the EU has ever concluded. 

Half of the EU's economic growth from CETA is expected to come from more trade in services.

European firms will have more opportunities to provide services, such as specialised maritime services like dredging, moving empty containers, or shipping certain cargo within Canada.

In sectors such as environmental services, telecoms and finance, European firms will be able to access Canada's market at both federal and – for the first time – provincial levels.

CETA doesn't cover public services, so:

EU Member States will be able to keep public monopoliesCETA won't force governments to privatise or deregulate public services like the water supply, health or educationEU Member States will continue to be able to:decide which services they want to keep universal and public andsubsidise them.

2346,"Your logic is flawed. Israel has legal control of some parts of Sinai because Egypt was willing to negotiate a treaty covering it. The lack of a treaty covering Gaza and the West Bank makes Israel a belligerent occupying power under international law. This is confirmed by multiple UN resolutions and statements by the International Court of Justice.

Even the Israeli government has long accepted it is an occupying power for the very reason that without being an occupying power, it's use of military powers in the occupied territories would have been illegal, and the Israeli government has thus explicitly argued that they *are* an occupying power to the Israeli High Court, and the Israeli High Court has confirmed this, and confirmed that international law therefore applies to the West Bank and Gaza. So for starters, if you don't accept that Israel has been an occupying power in these areas for the majority of the last multiple decades, you disagree even with the Israeli government.

As such, as an occupying power, Israel has a number of legal obligations which they are flagrantly violating.

Specifically they are in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, as an occupying power is conducting a war crime if it displaces an occupied population or moves its own population onto occupied territories as with settlements.

In 2004, the International Court of Justice confirmed the UN position that the occupied territories are legally to be considered occupied and that Israel is an occupying power. As a result, the UN also considers e.g. the Israeli declaration of Jerusalem as its capital to be a violation of the fourth Geneva Convention, as parts of the city are occupied territory until/unless Israel manages to secure a treaty giving them rights to it.

The lack of willingness on behalf of the other side to negotiate is irrelevant to these violations.

Additionally the barriers in the West Bank are also to a large extent a clear violation of the Geneva Conventions, for a number of reasons, including illegally expropriating private property in the occupied territories, and separating people from their property.

You can pretend this isn't the case all you want, but I'll trust actual judges in the actual International Court of Justice over you any day.

&gt; It's like people have to lie and pretend a country called Palestine existed that Israel invaded. Your side refused the original partition plan and tried to genocide Israel.

""My side"" are those who don't support invasions from either side, nor illegal occupations from either side, and includes the EU, the international Court of Justice, the UN, the UN Security Council and a long list of others who have never lifted a finger against Israel.

Not supporting the war crimes of one party does not mean one have to support the crimes or another party.

The fact that Israel was attacked does not grant them an exemption from following international law, or give them permission to carry out war crimes.

But, hey, I guess you think carrying out war crimes against civilians is just fine.

&gt; The type doesn't matter — graph the average MPGs if that's the concern.

Putting a word *compact* in front doesn't make SUVs any smaller, compared to an average city car. Those vehicles are large and build on principles to be (also) used off-road. Most of them never are.

Heavier and bigger cars not only consume more fuel, but also damage roads faster, etc.

2432,"These headlines look good but in reality the energy policies of Germany are beyond insane.

1. The carbon dioxide emissions have not gone down at all which was the main goal of all this. The emissions are as bad as seven years ago and 30-35 percent higher per capita than in France.

2. The German government panicked and decided to force energy companies to shutdown eight nuclear plants in perfect condition during fall of 2011. The energy companies sued the government because of the resulting MASSIVE losses and guess what, they WON last year!

3. The consumer energy prices are the highest in Europe. 

4. The grid has become so unstable they are actually scaling down the number of wind turbines. 

5. Most of the nuclear plants are/were in the southern Germany and most of the wind turbines are now in the north. They need to build 6000 kilometers of new power cables and have managed to build only a couple of hundreds of kiiometers. Thanks to fierce local resistance everywhere. 

6. Government is forcing energy companies to maintain old coal plants for backup power but only pays the running costs. Just like they did in the former DDR with the glorious centrally planned communistic system!

7. Thousands of nuclear plant workers have been fired and it is questionable can they even maintain the rest of the plants working for the scheduled forced shutdown of all of them by early next decade.

8. Poland is installing blockers to prevent the grid instability coming from German side through power transfer lines. That is how bad this all really is.

9. Germany burns even more coal because of those backup plants covering the lack of wind.

10. German government actually pays to wind turbine companies NOT to produce when there is an oversupply situation. Wind turbine companies have all the benefits but none of the liabilities or responsibilities of keeping the grid stable.

2440,"First, let me say that I agree with the general idea that the EU would be better-off it could focus more on skilled immigration.

However, I'd say that the EU also requires people in large numbers.  The aim isn't just adding a few people: there's a major demographic hole blown in Europe.  The EU has a rather-larger population that we do and a rather lower fertility rate.  Which means that your demand for immigration is even larger than ours.  Finding that many people may not be easy, especially without irritating the source countries.  It's typically easier to attract people if wages are higher.  There are limited numbers of countries that are poor, growing in population, and have a skilled workforce.

Second, that large-scale immigration, regardless of skill level, is going to be unpopular.  That's just how it works.  People don't like lots of immigration.  The EU can avoid having to ""sell"" publics on it via the refugee mechanism, since countries have already committed to that.  However, the refugee mechanism does not permit for skilled immigration.

Germany is, in my estimation, trying to build some facsimile of it atop the refugee mechanism: only granting German citizenship to those who can support themselves and providing a fixed momentary incentive to return.  The combination of these tends to send people who aren't making a living home (and, I assume, in the process register them so that they will have a hard time returning), as well as only accepting people with some base skillset into Germany as citizens.  That's better than nothing, but it is still a crude alternative to what the EU could have as skilled migration policy if the political barriers did not exist.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7nf682/all_things_considered_immigration_is_mostly/ds2iwvx/,vokegaf,1514873669

2470,"&gt; Are you for real? **The U.S. has been the most successful polity in human history** largely because we have been so good at spreading norms and rules favorable to us.

You are quite delusional if you actually believe this. The USA is not nearly as special as you seem to think and lots of other entities had a bigger and more enduring impact on the world (e.g. the Roman empire and the British empire; and if we are talking polities then we also got various religious institutions etc to consider). Furthermore, the main reason the USA had its short time of glory the way it happened was that its main competition self-destroyed via two world wars, which you managed to avoid easily due to your geographical position. 

&gt;To be frank, you are an incredibly stupid person if you seriously think that China will not attempt to do the same in a way that benefits SOE’s, domestic repression, censorship, and squelches dissent against Chinese actions.

So like the things the USA did and does in the third world? And who cares? The world is going to be multipolar again and will not be completely dominated by any single country anytime soon. Furthermore, from a Chinese perspective it might actually be harmful to spread its model too far because in their minds this might be the same as strengthening their competition. 

&gt; This, again, is why Europe is so useless to us: blindly smitten with the biggest challenge since the Soviets

2495,"If you look to the original comment, the statement affirms for the use of citations. The response calls for the need to weigh citations according to an impact factor. Their follow up is: 'Which is why I mentioned citations [...] I'm simply not aware of better metrics, but what could capture impact better than citations?'. Assuming that they did understand the point made, this comment is simply bizarre. It shows no appreciation for the point made and reiterates the original statement before correction. Which is why I responded to reaffirm the correction.

Their following response was to reframe the question to 'what could capture impact better', the question asked to the other guy beforehand, which was something I did not address, and to restate that until I could deliver something better than citations, that citations would remain the best metric. So I clarified my points which were:

1. Citations are good data points.

2. They still need to be qualified.

To this they responded that I already mentioned this and that I still have yet to provide some method or index to weigh citations. I was satisfied with the general answer that it needs to be qualified as a metric, but perhaps 'how do you propose it's weighted? How do you specifically propose improving it? [...] What specifically are these improvements you think need to be made?' might have been a badly worded request for a specific real existing example and not a request for me to invent something.

2544,"&gt;Prior to the US-led international order, the global norms were Spheres of Influence of different global powers. Prior to that, it was the Westphalian system and colonialism.

These are not norms and institutions of the size and scale we're dealing with today. 

&gt;My point is that the Chinese won't implement these by force or through coercion as there is no precedence for that on their end. 

You can't fix stupidity.

&gt; China hasn't tried to stifle these institutions outside of its own borders. 

See: Australia and South Korea. They haven't done it extensively because they haven't been able to, in no small part thanks to U.S. partnerships in Asia; this will grow less true as time passes, however.

&gt;If that were true, then Europe would be looking to stay with America.

Europe is not monolithic. EE very much wants to; the Scandinavians are on the fence. What's the common thread? The ones who view Russia as a threat rather than a gas station and piggy bank are less excited at the prospect. For Germans and Frenchmen, selling stuff to Russia and buying gas trumps all other concerns. 

That those two have a blind spot or otherwise don't care that the eastern flank exists thanks to us is their concern to deal with should we decide to stop propping it up. 

&gt;Yet when they look towards Russia and China, you have an issue with it.

I don't. I think it's just more evidence that Europeans lack anything resembling vision and long-term focus, and as yet more evidence that they are useless when it matters. A united front opposing China's mercantilist practices and demanding reciprocal access is preferable, but so many of you are naive fools like yourself and don't appreciate the risk it could pose in the future if not dealt with now. You even see an imaginary threat in your patron, while a real one sits to the east.

2556,"&gt; I think ""policewoman"" is easier to say, much more succint than ""female policeman"".

The problem is that by introducing the term ""policewoman"" you remove a unisex term. If you introduce ""policewoman"" then ""policeman"" will become masculine over time and you have to eventually start saying policemen/policewomen which is way longer than just ""policemen"" when the gender doesn't matter.

The cases where the gender is not relevant are like one hundred times as common as the cases where it is and then there are the cases where the gender is unknown.

Consider the word ""friend"", various languages actually have a specific term for a male friend and one for a female friend but non unisex one. In English you just typically say ""friend"" and when the sex is relevant you sometimes say ""male friend"" and ""female friend"". If some people actually successfully introduced ""friendess"" as a female form and ""friend"" became male only having to say friend/friendess all the time where you now say ""friend"" becomes cumbersome.

&gt; I never heard it brought up as political. Is there an article or something about it you read, or something?

The creation of terms like ""policewoman""? Surely you know there's a political debate going on with some people wanting to invent terms like ""chairwoman"" and others insisting that ""chairman"" be kept as a standard form regardless the sex.

* Must know the streets of the city they're licensed to cover

* Must have appropriate insurance for carrying paying passengers

* Must have vehicle's maintenance verified on a regular basis

* Must have a vehicle with appropriate cabin space for passengers

* Must comply with maximum allowed fare charging structures

* Must display regulatory and safety information within the cab, excess charges for soiling, etc

* Must not have certain types of criminal record

2585,"&gt; These are not norms and institutions of the size and scale we're dealing with today.

Size doesn't matter. What matters is how these institutions are implemented and how they function.

&gt; You can't fix stupidity.

Then please, prove China *will* implement these institutions by force or coercion.

&gt; See: Australia and South Korea. They haven't done it extensively because they haven't been able to, in no small part thanks to U.S. partnerships in Asia; this will grow less true as time passes, however.

I can't speak to Australia or South Korea as I am not familiar with the situations in both countries. But Chinese and South Korean leaders recently met and discussed a wide range of issues including deescalation of tensions on the Korean peninsula.

&gt; Europe is not monolithic. EE very much wants to; the Scandinavians are on the fence. What's the common thread? The ones who view Russia as a threat rather than a gas station and piggy bank are less excited at the prospect. For Germans and Frenchmen, selling stuff to Russia and buying gas trumps all other concerns. That those two have a blind spot or otherwise don't care that the eastern flank exists thanks to us is their concern to deal with should we decide to stop propping it up.

I actually agree with you on this. Europe shouldn't be a monolithic entity as each region of Europe has different interests. Hence why I don't support federalization of Europe as a whole. Each nation has its own interests.

&gt; A united front opposing China's mercantilist practices and demanding reciprocal access is preferable, but so many of you are naive fools like yourself and don't appreciate the risk it could pose in the future if not dealt with now. You even see an imaginary threat in your patron, while a real one sits to the east.

For the last time, please don't insult me. We are having a discussion, let's leave personal insults out of this.

Now, personally I think it would be better if trade reciprocity between Europe and China did exist. But the way to accomplish that wouldn't be to declare China a risk to the West. The way to do that is through trade negotiations. China has been open to these types of negotiations in the past. They offered to negotiate terms with the United States, which pleased the Trump Administration. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which include traditional Chinese enemies India and Japan, is also being negotiated. Why would these two countries, who know the threat China pose to their countries, even agree to this partnership if reciprocity wasn't at least discussed? Part of being a global power, which China aspires to, is sometimes doing things not in your national interests but in the interests of global stability and world order.",,/r/europe/comments/7nf62v/france_looks_to_deepen_trade_ties_with_china_and/ds2gat8/,thoth2,1514869307

Yeah, sure. Let's steal and kill and destroy the whole cities and then try to legalize what we did. That's why you're trying to sing that silly song about Civil war - to leave a backdoor, to skip the trial and legalize your crimes. No. The only appropriate way would be an international court, not international observers on your referendum.

&gt; so the only thing you want is revenge. 

Not only. First of all it's justice. You criminals must response. The second is to prevent such crimes in future. And the third is revenge, of course. You must learn that such things are always lead to troubles. Like Germans did.

&gt; propably, but we don't talk about Russia's actions

That's exacxtly what we're talking about - Russia's actions.

&gt; it is about the future of the territories.

Criminals must be punished, stolen property must be returned.

&gt; technically not, in reality she can't just look at what you do. 

We do what? The only place where it's dangerous in Ukraine is in Donvbass and Crimea. Read what UN statements about human rights. You are killing people because of their nationality and language and then blame Ukraine. Hypocrisy, as a national policy.

&gt; nice words, but the fact that Russia violated the International law doesn't allow you to do everything you want to there. the problem would still exist without Russia and you should deal with it. 

It's our land and we have our rights there. Not yours. You will get in troubles until you learn to live inside your borders. And don't try to blame anyone else in our crimes. 

But in general, it's an interesting discussion. You started from that silly ""civil war"" idea, but now you agree that Donbass is under Russia's controls and it's Russia violates international law, but still trying to somehow justify your motherland.

2787,"I would suggest that you [read the actual study](http://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/crimeanalysis2012.pdf) (pdf warning). The only answer they are certain about is that hiring more police leads to higher detection rates which lowers the general crime rate. And this is widely accepted across the board and it is easy to comprehend this effect. The scientists publishing the study have been a lot more vague than the article suggests and they also outlined the limits of their calculation model. The study also doesn't even include crimes of the kind we are discussing here. Even the ""improvements"" they calculated are at best marginal (in some cases even statistically irrelevant). They also ""just"" compared raw data without accounting for changes over time (society/demographics/etc.).  

I would also invite you to read [this article](https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2016/03/criminal-justice) which assesses that there can be a positive impact of harsher sentencing, but only up to a limit. Given that you brought up immigrants in this context however: 

&gt; The economists compare different groups; the highly educated are most sensitive to heftier sentences, while immigrants and drug-offenders are least sensitive.

Higher sentencing has the most impact on white-collar crimes. The impact on violence is significantly lower. There is also plenty of evidence from country proving the opposite of what you claim: Tougher sentences in the US have in part even been counterproductive. Look at the ""war on drugs"" for example. 

I think it is fair to say that an unconditional claim that ""harsher sentencing reduces crime"" isn't proven.

JAS 39 does not have enough lift to act as a bomber and a fighter at once. No plane in reality does. A fighter lightly loaded with AA weapons will always out-climb and out-manoeuvre a plane load with bombs, forcing that plane to jettison the load and abort the mission. Given that and our area we need at least 3 times  the number of JAS 39 as we have now.

2845,"&gt; I'm not entirely sure how Croats view us in Croatia, honestly. There's maybe like 30k-60k of us there? I'd guess we're pretty under the radar since we're so small. My parents are actually both from Bosnia, my mom was a refugee and my dad moved to Croatia before the war in either country to go to school and work. 

Ah that's interesting. Were there Bosnians who lived in Croatia wayyy back even before SFRJ times? Or even before the Kingdom of Yugoslavia times?

&gt;Your story about your friend is actually far too common, sadly. It's ironic, too, because it was the people alive before the war who grew up in a multi-ethnic state full of mixed marriages, but especially in Bosnia. The diaspora don't tend to be that way, and rightfully so, because we had nothing to do with all that. At the party I went to last night, there was a Serb kid with his Bosniak girlfriend, and from what I could gather, their parents were fine with it. 

Yes, I'm aware. I heard stories of during the war, in mixed families, different sides of mixed ethnic families (aside from the couples and their kids themselves) cut off contact from each other. Only recently such families eased things and came to terms with what happened and followed things with a reunion.

Were they Serbs from BiH or Serbia? Would that make a diff?

Do diaspora people from ex-yugo countries hang out often?

&gt;Yeah, people are definitely really surprised, I generally shy away from religion as much as possible, because I just don't like the stigma associated with being Muslim. I'd rather people not view me differently just because of my religion, especially when I'm not terribly religious anyway.

Yeah that's understandable.

The whole ex-yugo situation is interesting with religion being the dividing factor at times yet most aren't all that religious anyways.

Also, lol. I have a chuckle watching videos about bad things happening in ex-yugo countries (not necessarily ethnic problems) and people commenting from all those countries with the, ""if tito was alive, none of this bullshit would be happening.""

I wonder how Yugoslavia would be today if things did NOT break up. Economically and socially. I wonder what role would the internet play as well.

Some people say that democracy wouldn't work in yugoslavia since it would be a power struggle along ethnic lines unless over generations, ethnic lines get disrupted with an even greater yugoslav identity. I can see that happening. We already witness it in small scale in BiH.

It's pretty much self defence only. Most dedicated ground attack aircraft since the 1950s have guns and air to air missiles. The Jaguar, for example, or the A4 Skyhawk. 

If you go further back bombers all had guns for defensive use, and a bomber could be sent to shoot down other bombers, but that didn't mean there wasn't a distinction between bombers and fighters.

AFAIK none of the IDS versions of the Tornadoes are operated in the air to air role, they are purely used for ground attack, which means they shouldn't really be counted as fighters. ",,/r/europe/comments/7ndl51/fighter_aircraft_number_by_european_countries/ds1w7cl/,WhiteSatanicMills,1514843798

2878,"The Wikipedia page on each will cover the details of each aircraft.  I'll go back and link them.  However, going from memory:

Air Force:

In the US, the Air Force (mostly) handles land-based fixed-wing aircraft.  Transports, large bombers, land-based fighters, etc.  These aircraft don't need to be reinforced for the strain that carrier landings and takeoffs put on them, and can require a long runway and can be large.  These guys are responsible for defending homeland soil in the air.  In a World War III type scenario they have fast aircraft to intercept enemy bombers (""interceptors"") and fighters to escort friendly bombers.

* F-15: Fast, land-based air superiority fighter.  Two engines for more reliability.  Expensive and designed around killing other planes, without a lot of tradeoffs made for attacking ground targets.

* F-15E: Modifications made to also make it more-suitable for attacking ground targets.

* F-16: Inexpensive jack-of-all-trades.  Produced in large numbers.

* F-22: The ""new"" F-15: an expensive aircraft dedicated to killing other aircraft.  This time, stealthy.

* F-35A: The ""new"" F-16: an inexpensive jack-of-all-trades.  This time, stealthy.  Produced in large numbers.  Like all the F-35s, these will be increasing in number and replacing older aircraft over time.

Army:

Not relevant here, because their bailiwick doesn't cover fighters.

Marines:

Traditionally, these were the light infantry carried aboard ships.  They don't have the sort of heavy equipment that the Army does, which means that they can be moved quickly.  The US has a big emphasis on amphibious assault: sailing ships somewhere in the world and from offshore, rapidly seizing a beachhead or airport to let more, heavier forces flood in.  These guys do that.  I They have their own amphibious assault ships (think mini aircraft carriers) that can also launch flotillas of landing craft to put light armor and infantry ashore on a beach somewhere.  These ships are capable of operating F-35Bs directly.  I *think* that historically, Marine aircraft were those that could take off from Navy carriers but might also be operating at bases ashore once territory was seized.

* F/A-18: Carrier aircraft, reinforced to handle sudden stops and starts.  Multirole (both ""F""ighter and ground ""A""track).  Not sure exactly what separation of responsibility is between Marines and Navy here.

* F-35B: See above.  The ""B"" variant can operate like a helicopter or Harrier, taking off and landing vertically or over short distances, so can fly from amphibious assault ships.  The drawback is reduced range relative to the other F-35 variants.

* F-5: Old aircraft, used to play the bad guy in training.

Navy:

These guys operate the supercarriers.  Their aircraft mostly need to be able to fly their airccraft from a carrier, but they can rely on there being enough takeoff/landing space to not need to expend space and weight providing vertical takeoff.

* F-5: See above.  Old aircraft, used to play the bad guy in training.

* F-16: See above.

* F/A-18: See above.  The ""old"" main carrier aircraft.

* F/A-18E/F: Larger, newer version of the above.

* F-35C: See above.  The ""C"" variant requires a catapult and full-size carrier to takeoff and land.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7ndl51/fighter_aircraft_number_by_european_countries/ds1wcxw/,vokegaf,1514843992

2909,"/u/_Whoop explained it good and let me rexplain it with more detail.

I sometimes read Greek defense websites and many of them tell Greece to join more to EU projects(so Greek defense industry isn't devoloping as much as it should.Joining to more EU projects is the best choice for Greeks.There are problems with large scale projects in general but Greeks have to endure those for their sake).

The thing is defense industry is a very serious and complicated subject.It requires billions of dollars and tens of thousands of trained people and a good industry and most of the time an active battle zone to try your equipment for quality.Do you know how long did it take Turkey(a country whose industry sector itself is close to two times the whole economy of Greece) to get to these levels?(and it isn't even complete yet.Turkey will reach self sufficent level by 2025-2030) About 40 years.And Turkey is actively fighting against PKK which brings in enourmous amount of demand for local industry and a feed back about equipment most countries would never be able to get.

The thing is you can't compete with a country just by buying stuff espically if your economy, population,growth,industry etc. are smaller than other country.Turkey now exports more weapons than it imports and the balance is shifting more and more into favour of exports.Turkish weapon and aviation imports decreased by 50% in the last 5 years while exports increased by 100% and local demand is growing very fast.Turkish companies working in those fields are growing at 15-25% levels annually.

Greeks don't have the push(they don't have something like PKK or Islamist militants or 2 civil wars on their border like Turkey.I know that Turkey sometimes acts like a dickhead but you can be sure that it isn't that bad compared to those cluster fuck),economy, industry and time to do what Turkey did but they can atleast try to join to more projects and invest more into their industry which would decrease their dependency further to better levels.

I don't know how serious the push is for these stuff but it doesn't seem enough.

""chairman"" sounds like a person who chairs an organization whatever be their sex. ""chair man"" with the vowel different sounds like a male superhero whose special power deals with chairs; ""chair woman"" sounds like a similar female superhero and ""chair person"" sounds like someone with an affinity for chairs; someone who likes to sit down, like a ""cat person"".

The word ""man"" in English has a longer history of being unisex than male-specific anyway; these neologisms are annoying and symptomatic of a poor grasp of the origins of modern English.",The European flag is phallic as seen from above.,/r/europe/comments/7ngr6c/attack_on_policewoman_in_new_years_eve_champigny/ds1qftt/,alaplaceducalife,1514836931

As for expansion to the East; the EU has contributed significantly to the rebuilding of former communist countries through enormous amounts of funding. It is also involved in lots of development work all over the globe. 

As for NATO; it is a military alliance and not every (security) issue is a military issue or should be solved with military means. The EU has a wide range of economic, diplomatic, civilian and other instruments it can use to address issues prior to or complementing a military response.

3028,"
Brussels is preparing to call for a big increase in EU budget contributions during the 2020s in an effort to sustain the union’s post-Brexit spending power and cope with extra policy goals.

The European Commission is set to begin debating the design of the EU’s next long-term budget, which will become one of the bloc’s most fraught political battles in 2018. EU leaders will discuss priorities at a summit in February, leading up to a formal proposal in May.

Budget negotiations are typically hard-fought in Brussels because they require unanimity and pit big net contributors such as Germany and France against net beneficiaries such as Poland and Hungary. The €960bn 2014-2020 budget took almost 18 months and several EU summits to agree.

This time around the challenge is amplified by three factors: the UK’s exit leaving a gap of up to €10bn a year from 2021; demands for extra spending on migration and the eurozone; and east-west tensions over issues such as sharing refugees or the rule of law, which have exasperated countries that bankroll the common budget.

Günther Oettinger, the EU’s budget commissioner, has said half the financial gap “should be covered by cuts” and the remainder “by additional money from net payers”.

But even this approach is likely to break the EU’s self-imposed cap of 1 per cent of total EU gross national income — a German-backed political constraint on the size of the common budget that has held for more than a decade.

Outlining options to close the gap, Phil Hogan, the EU agriculture commissioner, in December asked whether “member states are prepared to increase the contribution from 1 per cent to 1.1 or 1.2 per cent of GNI”. Such an approach would take it up to the EU’s legal contributions ceiling of 1.23 per cent of EU GNI.

EU leaders spar over migration policy
While still extremely wary of big increases to total spending levels, net contributors including the Netherlands and Sweden are expected to make a bigger priority of reforming the use of the budget in the upcoming negotiations.

“Compared to the last [long-term budget], which was agreed in the middle of austerity policies, it seems member states are more open to an increase,” said Eulalia Rubio of the Jacques Delors Institute. “They are not going to fight to keep it at 1 per cent.”

The budget fights are expected to be a key element in the wider debate about the future of Europe. Germany will be keen to ensure that countries including Poland and Hungary uphold key EU values such as the rule of law in return for a larger financial contribution.

“The big thing people will be pushing for is making it conditional on adhering to EU values,” said Grégory Claeys of the Bruegel think-tank.

Warsaw and other non-eurozone capitals in eastern Europe are worried that a political stand-off may lead to Germany and France channelling more of the common EU budget towards schemes dedicated to those aiming to join the single currency bloc.

Other plans include a budget for migration, which would reform and centralise how various existing funds are used, potentially through tying development funding to migration policy goals in north Africa and the Middle East.

Where the EU is broadening its budget into new areas, Mr Oettinger is expected to suggest covering 80 per cent of costs through new contributions and 20 per cent through savings. Senior EU officials are also examining whether the EU budget can be leveraged through broadening the use of guarantees and other financial instruments beyond the existing 10 per cent limit.

3059,"Hmm. Reminds me of a comment from someone else in Reddit:

&gt;As a German, I find myself groaning whenever I see this discussion come up.

&gt;You seem to start with the assumption that these are fringe beliefs that forever stay on the fringe when left unchecked and never, ever have an impact on anyone else. This is simply not so. The ban on holocaust denial was instituted on a nation literally filled with Nazis. Every village, every city, every school, every government insitution - Nazis everywhere. The suppression of Nazi ideology was absolutely vital to rebuilding the country.

&gt;And it's not like there wasn't precedent about just how harmful letting a conspiracy theory run free can be. Are you familiar with the Dolchstoßlegende? It was a right-wing conspiracy theory circulating in Germany after WW1 that said that the German army hadn't truly lost the war but were ""stabbed in the back"" by cowardly revolutionaries (read: The Jews) at the home front - revolutionaries who went on to found the new democratic Weimar Republic. This conspiracy was widely believed by the German people as it fed into their victim complex and was one of the key tools with which the Weimar goverment's legitimacy was undermined - which allowed the Nazis to take power.

&gt;Speech has consequences. And sometimes, those consequences are so much more harmful than the consequences of outlawing it. Your rights end where harm to others begins. I see such unbelievable naivety about this matter from the Freeeeee Speeeeeech advocates.

    I'm of the opinion that the best way to expose a dumbass is show it off. Dismantle them violently and thoroughly. Deleting comments and questions arbitrarily and not on a case by case basis (don't have a problem nuking copypasta) doesn't do anything constructive.

&gt;Conspiracy theorists are not rational. If they could be swayed by facts and reason, they would not believe shit that even the most minor bit of fact checking would reveal to be untrue. Allowing them to spew their bullshit freely doesn't make them seek out people who'd disabuse them of their notions, it makes them seek out other people who share their beliefs - and who radicalize them further. We see the echo chamber effect right here on reddit. Whether or not the holocaust happened is not a matter of opinion, it is a matter of facts. You're entitled to your own opinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts. Making up your own facts is called lying. And when your lies are so malicious and harmful that they actually pose a threat to other people or the nation itself, then yes, that should absolutely be punishable. It's no different than slander or libel. What value is there to allowing holocaust denial? Serious question. And I don't mean appealing to the slippery slope of how it leads to other worse prohibitions. There's a lot of arguing for Free Speech for its own sake - that Free Speech is the highest virtue in and of itself that must never, ever be compromised, for any reason, and that this should be self-evident. But I ask, what's the harm in not allowing holocaust denial, specifically? What is the benefit in allowing it?

&gt;There is none.

&gt;Nothing good will ever come out of someone spewing holocaust denial. Ever. You won't get a thoughtful debate beneficial to both parties. They're wrong, simple as that. The ""best"" outcome you'll get out of it is that you can convince a denier or someone on the fence that they're wrong. Great. The best outcome involves suppressing it. There are, however, a hell of a lot potentially bad consequences in that their stupidity can infect others and shift the Overton window their way.

&gt;The reason that the vast majority of modern Germans look at the Nazi flag and feel nothing but revulsion whereas a sizable portion of US southerners actually fly the confederate flag and defend it (""Heritage, not hate"", ""It was about states' rights, not slavery"", ""Slaves weren't treated so bad"") is because Germans were forbidden from telling each other comforting lies about their past.

3097,"&gt; The process of creating nuclear energy is cheap, but the upfront costs of building a nuclear power plant is expensive. I would argue that the construction costs of building new nuclear power plants will be paid off in the long run in today's climate. The upfront costs could be solved by low-interest loans, government subsidies, slightly higher electricity bill, higher productivity, proper planning, and the long life-span of nuclear power plants. 

this isn't correct, see for example [M.V Ramana's (physicist and nuclear energy economsit) article in this edition of nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nenergy201520)

Because of stagnating / shrinking population and energy demand in countries like Germany the high capital costs of nuclear plants make them uneconomical. Which is pretty obvious, capital intensive investment only makes sense in a growth environment. That's why pretty much all nuclear development happens in the developing world. 

If you've payed attention to how much money the big producers have written off in an effort to move to a more diverse *energy Mittelstand* you would have seen that they've invested billions alone over the last two or three years to move away from centralised large scale energy production. 

&gt;There must be a balance between renewable energy and having a reliable and high productivity energy source. Nuclear power offers this backup. 

&gt;I find it hard to believe using just renewable energy will be sustainable and reliable. What happens if there is ever a long period of time where there is no sunshine or wind? 

The logical conventional alternative is gas because it is significantly cheaper and lighter on emissions, and in the long term storage capacity and energy markets are entirely capable of satisfying all energy needs.

3112,"&gt; It's less than half and dropping.

That's misleading. Support like this tends to heighten when people are forced to make a decision. For it to fall back when there's no imminent referendum is what you'd expect. That it remains as high as it does means it'll take very, very little before opinion shifts firmly. 

Also, the support is actually higher than it's been for many months as it is.

&gt; Scots are not so daft as to pretend they are being forcibly refused one after just having a referendum. Your argument may hold sway if we didn't literally just have a referendum that failed.

Time passes. It won't be long before it doesn't seem like we ""just"" had it. And they'll just keep pushing.  With Brexit looming there's every reason there'll be changes in attitudes to a referendum soon enough.

&gt;  Anyibe running around in the media shouting they are being suppressed will just get laughed at, especially considering Catalonia.

On the contrary  I think Catalonia shows exactly how sinister having to ask for permission to hold a vote is. That a supposedly democratic country are preventing a region from deciding its own fate, to me makes that state oppressive by definition. If I had been in Catalonia, the way the Spanish government treated it would have made me decide in favor of independence no matter what else I might think on the matter. 

And if I was in Scotland, and Westminster brushed them off if they formally request a vote, I might very well decide that getting away from such a dismissive government would outweigh the downsides of leaving.

Not everyone will think like that, but enough do that it's a dangerous game to play to laugh it off, and I also think the SNP will look very closely at what happens in Catalonia going forward to see whether it's worth taking the same gamble. *Especially* because if they then declare a unilateral referendum, everyone will remember Catalonia and worry about the UK being equally brutal, so the scrutiny will be much higher. People were caught by surprise at how brutal Spain was - but won't be caught by surprise again.

&gt; Both are not that friendly towards LGBT rights, both hold conservative if not actually oppressive views towards women. At least, that is true in some European countries.

The dishonesty in your comment is obvious from your laughable attempt at bridging the gap between European populists and conservative Muslims. ""Not that friendly"" does not make justice to the threats that LGBTs face from ""conservative Muslims"" in the Middle East. How about ""murderous"" or ""deadly""? Also, ""conservative views towards women"" is again a blatant attempt to disguise the state-sanctioned subjugation of women in many ME countries. I don't think you can name too many European places were women can be locked, beaten, raped or murdered for not wearing a piece of cloth on their heads.

This is always what happens, nationalists are attacked but then nobody defines what a country is meant to be without any kind of nationalism. If France does not exist for the betterment of the French, then what purpose does it serve? Why would anyone want to serve their country, as Macron advises, if they do not perceive their country to support them in turn?

I am being serious, because this is the argument that seems to be being lost around Europe and why nationalism is rising. If France has no preference for French people, Britain no preference for British people, Germany no preference for German people - why would these countries exist?

And if you can't define what France is (a set of values? a passport? a legal system? an ethnic group - ""the French people""? something else?), let alone what it should be, then how on Earth do you contextualise ""success""?

Not having nationalism isn't a solution, it's the creation of a vacuum that will be filled with a different kind of group identity (religious, racial, political or just nationalism again for a local identity e.g. Breton or in my case Scottish), but Macron, Merkel, May et al. seem to have no notion of what comes after nationalism or what goes in the vacuum they want to open up.

Stop saying ""nationalism = bad"" and start saying what is good, what is the better alternative. The EU, European nationalism? Humanism?

Because without nationalism and without religion and without cultural homogeneity and without racial group identity then what is a country meant to measure its success by?

3369,"&gt; They cannot be sent back legally.

Those who are economic migrants and not refugees with a valid asylum claim totally can and should be send back. Also, the situation in Iraq and Syria is improving. The Iraqis that came to Europe in 2015 can now be send back, the ISIS in Iraq has been defeated and the Iraqi government has the situation under control.

In Syria, there are still places of heavy fighting, but also many places that are already secured - the government-controlled areas or Rojava. Are those places a good place to live? No, of course not, they are hardly some bastions of human rights and economic prosperity, but Europe simply cannot accept anyone in the world who lives in a shithole.

Syria is nowadays partly safe, the same as Iraq and Afghanistan. The refugees can go back. Syrians perhaps not now yet, but by the end of 2018 it should be possible.

&gt; but no one in the ""populist right"" has a solution other than banning any and all future immigration

I'm not sure what populist right party says that, I'm under the impression that not even populist right-wing parties have anything against the legal migration of highly-skilled people.

&gt; Now what about those who are already here and those who will eventualy qualify for asylum in the future? What happens to them? They will eventually become citizens. So what to do now?

Why would they become citizens? Refugees are in their host country only temporarily for the time when their home country is not safe. The moment their home country is safe, they should go back. Obviously there are exceptions for refugees who are escaping for political reasons or other reasons that are somehow unique to their individual situation, i.e. they are persecuted by a regime that stays in power for a long time so they can never realistically return back. For these people, there should be a legal path to citizenship open should they meet the requirements. But for war refugees who aren't persecuted on individual bases, there is no reason to not deport them once the war is largely finished.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/7n7hv0/europe_is_not_ready_for_the_next_migration_surge/ds18twv/,kristynaZ,1514808685

European countries instead focused on tank battalions and armoured infantry; any war with the Soviet Union would be fought on land. The Europeans would slow the Soviets down as much as they could while waiting on US airpower to arrive.

Since 1990 many EU armies have switched to more expeditionary compositions so we see more aircraft (Germany being slowest).

With the exception of passively safe reactors, most safety systems can be retrofitted.

&gt;First of all, nuclear plants are also subsidized. 

In the past, perhaps, but not now. In fact, the opposite is true, with nuclear reactors being forced to pay unique taxes, such as a nuclear fuel tax.

Although that one did get ruled illegal last year.

Sure, it's easier to pretend that the people who we hurt with our actions don't exist, but that is not an honest outlook. What we should do is acknowledge the downsides of every action and make certain that the good is worth the bad. And to do that we must accept that the bad exists, we can't pretend it away.

And we need to acknowledge that the people who get the good and the people who get the bad are often two different people. Perhaps we should try to compensate this for the people in the latter group, and again, to do this we need to acknowledge that they exist.

3549,"""Fun"" fact: Although agreeing to the ceasefire, the Red army continued the war for one more day after Finnish troops stopped fighting...

Mainly it was that when the Finnish troops had orders to cease fire (ammo had actually been taken from some of the frontline troops already) the Red army opens fire and begins artillery barrages.

This was a test to see how Finnish troops react (or a mistake because someone was too slow to notify the troops that the war is over.) In some key locations Red army actually begins an attack and violates the ceasefire in an attempt to make a breakthrough. Finnish commander in the area begs for permission to get ammo for his troops and return fire and the permission is given. As Finnish troops start shooting back the Soviets halt their attack. There is a theory that if Finns had been more cautious the Soviets might have used that opportunity to break the treaty and take over the country, but officially this was just a crazy mixup.

For decades talking about this incident is taboo.

Europeans always underestimate the psychological, not practical, value Americans put on NATO. It never came into tension with the practical, because little was asked of most in NATO.

3692,"I think the west has a lot more to lose by abandoning the east than it has to gain in letting Russia do what it wants. The EU would collapse the moment one of its members was attacked and the rest of the union did not respect their obligation to defend said attacked member. Not to mention that any hope in the western members to avoid intervening would meet severe backlash among the eastern members, who would see such a thing as the ultimate proof that the west never cared for them at all. The most important thing to the EU is keeping itself alive. If doing that requires going to war against Russia, it will happen. Your stance is based entirely on a complete misunderstanding of what is at stake for the EU and its individual members in the event of an attack on one of its members and I also suspect that you hold your stance partly because it allows you to criticise countries you dislike.

&gt; This is one of many reasons why I think we should our role in the area. Propping up a union that's shown its true colors by undermining us in trade across the globe while protesting en masse and refusing to consider one with us is foolishness. Not all enemies appear villain-like

There are enough words missing here that I don't totally understand what you are trying to say.

I think the US has too much economic interest in Europe for sentimental reasons to really be at all relevant in any hypothetical scenario that threatens the continent, but I understand why helping the EU is unappealing. I think it is a shame that Europe can occasionally use the US to score cheap points, but on the other hand I am sad that just because the EU is no longer afraid to disagree with the US, it is suddenly a popular thought among Americans that it should be allowed to burn.

3703,"House is more likely than the Senate.

First of all, each Senator serves for 6 years.  That means that 1/3 of the Senate (approx) is up for election every 2 years.

In 2018, there are 34 Senate seats up for election.  Twenty-six are held by Democrats or Dem-allied independents (Bernie Sanders and Angus King).  Ten of those Dems represent states that Trump won.  Only 8 Republican Senators are facing an election.

Doug Jones's win in Alabama makes it possible for the Dems to take the Senate, but not probable.  There are currently 3 Senate races that look competitive: Nevada, Arizona, and Tennessee (b/c popular former governor Phil Bredesen, a Dem, is running for Senate).  Dems would have to win 2 of them without losing any of their races.

Of course, the political environment is very pro-Democratic at the moment.  The Dems who represent Trump states are popular with their voters, though some might be in trouble (e.g., McCaskill).  Most polls are going to be biased in favor of Republicans, because they survey ""likely voters,"" which is often defined as, ""People who voted in the last two elections.""  Dems had a terrible turnout in 2014, whereas they are probably going to have an incredibly high turnout in 2018.  ""Likely voter"" polls will therefore tend to underestimate Democratic turnout.

The House is gerrymandered more than it's ever been before, but gerrymandering can backfire during a wave election.  That's because gerrymandering tries to avoid wasting votes for the controlling party.  So, for example, Republicans would try to avoid creating R+10 districts (where a Republican would be expected to win by 10), because that would waste 9 points worth of Republican votes.  Instead, they'd try to spread those Republicans around a bit and create something like an R+3 and an R+4 district.  

Normally that would be enough, but current generic ballot polls show the Democrats ahead by about [13%](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2018_generic_congressional_vote-6185.html).  That signals a Democratic wave election is coming, one that will be strong enough to overcome things like an R+3/4 bias.

The Dems will also do well in state legislative and gubernatorial elections.  Thirty-six governor's mansions are up for election next year.  This is a big deal because the next round of House redistricting takes place in 2021 (when the states redraw their US House districts based on the 2020 census).  The more state governments Democrats control at that time, either in whole or in part, the more they can undo the Republicans' gerrymandering.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7n7qb5/the_2018_prediction_thread/ds0xg3e/,executivemonkey,1514779711

Can you provide some evidence (data!) that integration goes down as anti-immigrant-sentiments go up? You can't just rely on what you feel is common sense.

That common sense can be easily flipped: Muslims in the EU are less integrated than US because they don't have to integrate (because of less welfare/harsher). Integration only happens when boxed in a corner. If they live in a harsher environment they might respect our society because their integration came with a price.

I would argue that your country has a permanently curtailed capacity for the kind social cohesion and stability that the traditional nation states of Europe and elsewhere possess. 
 
 You have been the most technologically developed and prosperous economic power for roughly a century, and still this has not masked the impossible task of meaningfully tying together a country with no uniform ethnic identity and thus no true feeling of the kind of kinship that countries formed from a distinct ethnic group can draw from. 

The US is probably best equipped to tie people together via abstract creeds, but this will never be as powerful a bind as the perception of blood ties between citizens.

Do you have a source for that? According to the BPB 26%, 30% and 39% of the refugees that arrived in 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively were supposedly 15 or younger (source: https://m.bpb.de/politik/innenpolitik/flucht/218788/zahlen-zu-asyl-in-deutschland). That doesn't add up with your stats at all. Are you maybe referring just to the number of actual refugees who were granted actual proper asylum?

You either misunderstood me or you're purposefully building a strawman. Here is the actual context:

""And on top of that the FPÖ does such revolting revisionist policy as actively voting against lifting the sentences of deserters from Wehrmacht. In my mind these people deserve our honor, the FPÖ wants to label them criminals. But it has nothing to do with the nazis, right? Honestly, who are you fooling?""

I was making the comment you're quoting exclusively in connection to their vote on the Wehrmacht deserters. If you think Wehrmacht deserters are criminals, I think that has a lot to do with being a nazi. 

&gt; That might be true. Then I'd suggest that the conversation should focus on the good arguments and leave out the ""they're Nazis"" bit unless people are prepared to support that.

The UK lost a great deal of its military hardware in the [Battle of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France).

After [Dunkirk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk_evacuation), there was some considerable concern that Germany might go ahead with [an invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea_Lion), with the British Army not yet restored to strength militarily.  And so the British had a great interest in rapidly obtaining weaponry.

One thing that the UK did have at the time was a great deal of stockpiled gasoline.

And so, the UK formed the [Petroleum Warfare Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_Warfare_Department), which came up with odd weapons and traps that utilized gasoline.

&gt; The experiments led to a particularly promising arrangement: a forty-gallon steel drum[f] buried in an earthen bank with just the round front end exposed. At the back of the drum was an explosive which when triggered ruptured the drum and shot a jet of flame about 10 feet (3.0 m) wide and 30 yards (27 m) long.[35]...In all some 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were distributed of which the great majority were installed in one of 7,000 batteries mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7n9ick/in_the_netherlands_we_celebrate_new_years_by/ds0gjhj/,vokegaf,1514756930

3981,"&gt; there are many countries that want to leave the EU heres a wikipedia article with a list (there are 6 countries with political parties wanting to leave)

having a party who wants to leave is not the same as ""country wants to leave"" - and btw the wikilin is outdated - at least in Hungary, Jobbik is not campaigning for leaving EU anymore.

&gt; Also I don't know about the budget deficit thing with Hungary, could you provide me resources?

sorry for the crappy source, hard to find after so many years:

https://theorangefiles.hu/hungary-and-the-european-union-excessive-deficit-procedure

&gt; On February 22, 2012, The European Commission proposed that the EU suspend 29 percent of Hungary’s 2013 Cohesion Fund subsidies of 1.7 billion euros. (European Union Cohesion Funding is allocated to members states whose GDP is below 90 percent of the EU average in order to finance investments to improve infrastructure and protect the environment.) The EC based this decision on its previous conclusion that Hungary’s 2011 surplus had been the result of the takeover of private pension-funds and its forecast of renewed deficits in 2012 and 2013. This marked the first time that the European Commission had ever initiated the suspension of the Cohesion Fund subsidies of an EU member state.

Relevant information, debunking the usual propaganda, such as circumcision lowering rates of infections, STDs, and penile cancer:

http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896.full.pdf

- From a public health perspective, what seems to be the AAP technical report’s most important argument is that circumcision may reduce the burden
of heterosexually transmitted HIV infections in the United States. **Three RCTs in Kenya, Uganda, and South Africa suggest that circumcision in adulthood may lead to a noticeable reduction in risk of heterosexual HIV acquisition in areas with extremely high HIV prevalence. This evidence, however, is contradicted by other studies, which show no relationship between HIV infection rates and circumcision status.**

- **However, there is no evidence that circumcision, whether in infancy, childhood, or adulthood, is effective in preventing heterosexual transmission in countries where HIV prevalence is much lower and routes of transmission are different, such as Europe and the United States.** *Sexually transmitted HIV infections in the West occur predominantly among men who have sex with men, and there is no evidence that circumcision offers any protection against HIV acquisition in this group.*

- **The African findings are also not in line with the fact that the United States combines a high prevalence of STDs and HIV infections with a high percentage of routine circumcisions.** **The situation in most European countries is precisely the reverse: low circumcision rates combined with low HIV and STD rates**. 

- As with the other possible benefits, **circumcision for HIV protection in Western countries fails to meet the criteria for preventive medicine: there is no strong evidence for effectiveness and other, more effective, and less intrusive means are available.** There is also no compelling reason why the procedure should be performed long before sexual debut; **sexually transmitted HIV infection is not a relevant threat to children.**





- **UTI incidence does not seem to be lower in the United States, with high circumcision rates compared with Europe with low circumcision rates, and the AAP report suggests it will take ∼100 circumcisions to prevent 1 case of UTI**. **Using reasonable European estimates cited in the AAP report for the frequency of surgical and postoperative complications (∼2%), for every 100 circumcisions, 1 case of UTI may be prevented at the cost of 2 cases of hemorrhage, infection, or, in rare instances, more severe outcomes or even death.**

- **According to the AAP report,  between 909 and 322,000 circumcisions are needed to prevent 1 case of penile cancer.** Penile cancer is linked to infection with human papilloma viruses, which can be prevented without tissue loss through condom use and prophylactic vaccination. **It is remarkable that incidence rates of penile cancer in the United States, where ∼75% of the non-Jewish, non-Muslim male population is circumcised, are similar to rates in northern Europe, where 10% of the male population is circumcised.** 

- According to the AAP report, there is evidence that circumcision provides protection against 2 common viral STDs: genital herpes and genital warts. **However, the evidence in favor of this claim is based primarily on findings in RCTs conducted among adult men in sub-Saharan Africa**. **For other STDs, such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, circumcision offers no convincing protection.** The authors of the AAP report forget to stress that responsible use of condoms, regardless of circumcision status, will provide close to 100% reduction in risk for any STD. **In addition, STDs occur only after sexual debut, which implies that the decision of whether to circumcise can be postponed to an age when boys are old enough to decide for themselves.**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization

&gt;A civilization (UK and US) or civilisation (UK variant) is any complex society characterized by urban development, social stratification imposed by a cultural elite, symbolic systems of communication (for example, writing systems), and a perceived separation from and domination over the natural environment.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]
&gt;
&gt; Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including centralization, the domestication of both humans and other organisms, specialization of labour, culturally ingrained ideologies of progress and supremacism, monumental architecture, taxation, societal dependence upon farming and expansionism.[2][3][4][6][7][8] Historically, a civilization was a so-called ""advanced"" culture in contrast to more supposedly primitive cultures.[1][3][4][9] In this broad sense, a civilization contrasts with non-centralized tribal societies, including the cultures of nomadic pastoralists, Neolithic societies or hunter-gatherers. As an uncountable noun, civilization also refers to the process of a society developing into a centralized, urbanized, stratified structure. Civilizations are organized in densely populated settlements divided into hierarchical social classes with a ruling elite and subordinate urban and rural populations, which engage in intensive agriculture, mining, small-scale manufacture and trade. Civilization concentrates power, extending human control over the rest of nature, including over other human beings.[10]

4260,"&gt; it's the fact that Berlin doesn't bring wealth at all to Germany. (In average.)

That's of course nonsense. You and the Economist should take a maths course sometimes.

If you have three children, one is earning 10000 a year, the second 20000, and the third is earning 30000.

The structure and history of Berlin, Paris and London is very different. Basically the Economist found out that Berlin is in the eastern parts of Germany and that Germany is a Federal Republic. Congratulations!

-He likened warhawks like John McCain to Cato the Elder (“Carthago delenda est”)
-Saddamm+ Gaddaffi toppled and their families killed in Western attacks. 
- Missile shield consistently encircles them, MAD undermined

Trump effectively validated conquest by right when he recognised Jerusalem. 

The West should come to accords with Russia (I feel) give a trade deal to help Ukraines economy , allow visas to live and work in EU but leave it in Russia’s sphere of influence. Where the West should be hawkish is on the Baltic nations.

Russia has historically been very insistent on buffer zones (similar to China). People may hate me for saying that but it’s the realpolitik way to settle things. Countries like Finland are being hit by the sanctions.

&gt;Maduro, speaking from the presidential palace, blamed a “sabotage” campaign by enemies abroad for the delayed arrival of three planes carrying the new 500, 2,000 and 20,000 bolivar notes.
&gt;
&gt;“One plane, contracted and paid for by Venezuela, was told in flight to change direction and go to another country,” he said, without specifying who had given the orders. “There’s another which was not given flyover permission.” 

* enemies abroad

&gt;Maduro had justified the 100 bolivar note’s elimination as a way of strangling mafia and smugglers on the frontier with Colombia. He has also closed border crossings with Colombia and Brazil until Jan. 2.

&gt;Addressing thousands of supporters at a rally in Caracas, Maduro blamed the opposition for stirring violence and said some members of the Justice First and Popular Will parties were arrested for colluding with mafias.

[Four years ago](http://wlrn.org/post/how-venezuelas-maduro-mess-keeps-getting-worse)

&gt;When the latest blackout, on Tuesday, shut down more than two-thirds of Venezuela – the western hemisphere’s most oil-rich nation, mind you – Maduro dismissed suggestions that maybe the problem was a power grid that’s been neglected and mismanaged since Chávez took power 14 years ago. Instead, Maduro blamed “right-wing” opposition sabotage, calling the epic outage “an electricity coup.”
&gt;
&gt;As if that didn’t make him sound nutty enough, Maduro the next day ordered the formation of a special ops force to protect the grid from all those fascist electro-saboteurs. “I have decided,” he tweeted, “to create the Electrical System Security and Intelligence Unit as an organ of special forces that will guarantee its defense.” Most Venezuelans, who are smart enough to know the situation calls for utility experts instead of Navy SEALs, rejected Maduro’s conspiracy theory.

* electrical saboteurs

&gt;Like Chávez, Maduro keeps a shelf full of usual suspects, from U.S. mercenaries plotting to assassinate him to opposition homosexuals scheming to “prostitute” Venezuelan youths.

* US mercenaries

* opposition homosexuals

&gt;On Planet Chavista, Venezuela’s soaring inflation rate – which hit 42 percent in July – has nothing to do with the government’s currency-control chaos; it is, you guessed it, a conspiracy of right-wing speculators.  Its spiraling violent crime – including South America’s worst murder rate – is due not to a dysfunctional police and judicial system but to capitalism. Its chronic shortage of basic goods, from eggs to toilet paper, is the fault of producers, despite the fact that producers have little if any economic incentive in Venezuela today to produce.

&gt;The British news agency reports that Maduro blamed activists for the destruction and accused opposition lawmaker Julio Borges of inciting further violence.
&gt;
&gt;Others, such as the European Union, have been less inclined to blame the violence on the opposition. Rather, in a statement released Monday, the international organization declared that ""fundamental rights of the Venezuelan people must be respected, including the right to peacefully demonstrate. It is crucial that all parties refrain from violent acts.""

Society degrades the more diverse it gets. As shown by Robert D. Putnam:


Lowered trust in areas with high diversity is also associated with:

Lower confidence in local government, local leaders and the local news media.


Lower political efficacy – that is, confidence in one's own influence.


Lower frequency of registering to vote, but more interest and knowledge about politics and more participation in protest marches and social reform groups.


Higher political advocacy, but lower expectations that it will bring about a desirable result.


Less expectation that others will cooperate to solve dilemmas of collective action (e.g., voluntary conservation to ease a water or energy shortage).


Less likelihood of working on a community project.


Less likelihood of giving to charity or volunteering.


Fewer close friends and confidants.
Less happiness and lower perceived quality of life.

4374,"That's not true. We're not all born equal, humans differ in hundred different ways and none of it is by choice. Most humans arent equal to each other and so are most groups of humans. 

Humans are animal and we're suited to live amongst our own and we suffer if we don't. Robert J Putnam proved this in his studies: 

Lowered trust in areas with high diversity is also associated with:

Lower confidence in local government, local leaders and the local news media.

Lower political efficacy – that is, confidence in one's own influence.

Lower frequency of registering to vote, but more interest and knowledge about politics and more participation in protest marches and social reform groups.

Higher political advocacy, but lower expectations that it will bring about a desirable result.

Less expectation that others will cooperate to solve dilemmas of collective action (e.g., voluntary conservation to ease a water or energy shortage).

Less likelihood of working on a community project.

Less likelihood of giving to charity or volunteering.

Fewer close friends and confidants.
Less happiness and lower perceived quality of life.

More time spent watching television and more agreement that ""television is my most important form of entertainment"".

4403,"Firstly I'll look at my 2017 predictions:
&gt;More Islamist attacks in Western Europe — correct, sadly (London, Barcelona, Manchester...).  
&gt;Syria continues to burn — at the very least ISIS is almost crushed, but the war continues regardless. 
&gt;Brexit negotiations stall indefinitely, thus de-facto keeping Britain in the EU — it went better than I expected, so probably false  
&gt;Le Pen is not allowed anywhere near the French presidency — it was obvious from the start.  
&gt;More of the same in Ukraine — continuing political instability, economy in the gutter, the War in Donbass going on as usual, so correct.  
&gt;More of the same in Russia — besides Navalny trying to provoke his own Maidan, pretty much correct.  
&gt;US President Trump decides to focus on internal policies and the economy, spectacularly fucks up at both. Rise in inter-racial tensions in America and even more riots at best, domestic terrorism at worst. Trump memes are nice, though — not as bad as I feared, but Berkeley and Charlottesville still happened.  
&gt;The Donald delegates (is forced to delegate) foreign policy matters to other Republicans. No détente for you, Putin! :(  — no matter what people on r/worldnews and r/politics like to say, America did not relax its policies on Russia, so correct. Trump had more influence on foreign policy matters that I expected, though.  
&gt;Russian and Belarusian national football teams continue to suck balls — very obvious.  

Now, 2018:  
* The ongoing protests in Iran ultimately fail to overthrow Ayatollah Khomeini and the Revolutionary Guard. Mass arrests follow, and things continue as usual. 
* Sabre-rattling at the Korean peninsula continues, but no war happens.  
* The 2018 Winter Olympics goes on as planned. Russian state media spins the successes of the neutral athletes from Russia as Russian victories, while nationalists call them traitors for participating in the first place.  
* ""The Election of Putin to the post of Presidency"", as some wise guys on VK like to call it, awards him 80-85% of the votes. The Belarusian scenario of 2010 happens afterwards: Navalny and several hundred students try to start a ""democratic revolution"" in Moscow and St. Petersburg, only to get crushed by riot police; Navalny himself is promptly jailed on charges of ""inciting riots"", and others are arrested, expelled from universities, etc. In response, the US and the EU put more sanctions on Russia. Russian state media puts the blame on Western intelligence agencies for the whole mess. Afterwards, things go on as usual.  
* Peace talks in Donbass fail entirely, and the war escalates to the level of winter of 2015, as Ukraine, emboldened by American arms sales, launches an offensive against DNR and LNR. Ukrainian artillery once again shells Donetsk and Lugansk. In response, Russia ramps up its support of Russian irredentists by sending more weapons and providing intelligence support. More civilians die, and there's no hope of peace for the rest.  
* With ISIS driven underground, Assad and the US-backed SDF lose their common enemy. They immediately start fighting each other over dominance in Syria. The war goes on.  
* The very important Trump investigation fail to produce any meaningful results, and Trump remains unimpeached. Minor gains for Dems in the midterm elections.  
* Hopefully less Islamist attacks in Western Europe, compared to 2017.  
* I'm not that knowledgeable on the finer details of British, French and German politics, so I can't say what will happen there. Something will be definitely going on, for sure.
* Germany wins the 2018 World Cup, while the hosts Russia fail to even quit the group stage.  ",Belarus,/r/europe/comments/7n7qb5/the_2018_prediction_thread/drzukod/,TheGuardianGI,1514728404

* Hung parliament in italy, MPs leave and join parties trying to guess who will come out on top: some mix of technical and grand coalition governments makes the minimum amount of reforms necessary to keep going until someone sees an advantage in new elections.  

* The divide between the UK and EU approach to brexit continues, as one sees the agreement as a purely economical matter while the other as an ideological one, leading to 11th hour deals over and over to meet deadlines.

* A lull in migration kills most of the populist movements and impetus for reforming the current migration policies in the EU, waiting for the next crisis to find us only a bit more prepared.

* The situation in the ME is mostly stable, with the current protests in Iran slowing down and finally ending with no big changes.  
Saudi Arabia continues on its bullish path, strong of Trump support.  
The Syrian civil war becomes basically a frozen conflict, as no one has big interests in it anymore, and the energies on all sides are spent.  
The Israel-Palestine conflict surges a bit, but the current relationships with the countries around the area are such that no big war comes out of it.

4523,"Rightfully so.

The amount of chaos and lack of government oversight in the asylum system in my country is simply crazy. That should be expected from a developing nation but not from Germany.

Abuse of the asylum system is rampant. You can look at every aspect of the system and you see it. There have been countless reports about it. There are literally IS-fighters coming to Germany and we do nothing about it.

All the terrorist since had multiple identities. ""Refugee children"" for found to be mostly adults and deportations are hardly ever enforced. *Refugees need to go home eventually*. But strangely, left-wing people talk about how refugees will fix the population dent or help the economy as a new workforce.

And since age and identity is obviously lied about, why should not also the country of origin? I believe that a large part of our ""Syrians"" are just from other countries that splipped in.


There is one really obvious solution to all of this: **Do not let people enter the country without passports or other proofs of identity**

All these tests and interviews will never work. Maybe for single cases where you have a team of expoerts that deal with the case for days, yeah. But as a system that has to work thousands of cases? Never. It's just emtpy political activism to pretend like the government has control over who the refugees are.

And yes, I have seen all the arguments against it:

- people are running away from war, they don't have documents: Most refugees coming to Europe make the concsious descision to travel to Europe *after they fled* to safer zones. Yes, they do pack their things.

- there might be legitimate reasons not to have a passport: Yes. Some real refugees might be turned down. But we have to do it as a act of self-protection in order to have control over the system.

And the worst part? The largest parties here in Germany (CDU, SPD) offer no solutions whatsoever to fix this. The SPD actually wants more legal possibilities for Africans to migrate. *That will make things worse*. The only party who even identified this problem, the AfD, is sadly a pretty crazy semi-nazi party. The entire left-wing of the spectrum is completly delusional, while the center-right (CDU, CSU, FDP) talk only about family reunification... which is not the actual problem.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7n0odn/opinion_murder_of_german_girl_will_have_political/drzrrww/,tschwib,1514721571

&gt;Ronduit spectaculair in dit archief is een serie van vier foto's uit 1889, tot stand gekomen door een ingenieuze techniek. Over het ijs achter het Rijksmuseum werden draadjes gespannen, verbonden met de sluiters van verschillende camera's. Een schaatser die deze draadjes verbrak, legde zichzelf met minieme tijdsintervallen vast op verschillende foto's - de zogenaamde momentphotographie. 

&gt;Zo werd een vloeiende schaatsbeweging vastgelegd als een primitieve voorloper van film, merkte schaatshistoricus Marnix Koolhaas in 2003 al eens op in een onderzoek.

&gt;Om het filmisch effect te krijgen moeten de vier afbeeldingen wel in een vloeiende presentatie worden vertoond. Met de huidige digitale technologie is het heel makkelijk om dat te realiseren en zo hebben we voor de eerste keer bewegend beeld uit 1889, bijna tien jaar eerder gemaakt dan de oudste Nederlandse filmbeelden die we tot nu toe kenden

Also the public transport is amazing: almost always on time, very cheap and fast, here in Germany it costs about S$3 to literally ride 1 station, a trip of 5 minutes... And if it's not your lucky day then you'll have at least one delay over 10 minutes on your daily commute...

Favorite place? Many, but what I still miss are hawkers and small restaurants. I lived on Bt. Timah Rd and there's a number of cozy little restaurants along it I loved going to. I also really liked the downtown area, I'm still fascinated that a single mall in SG is about the size of our two malls in Dresden and that there's far more than a handful of them... In other words, there was always something fun to do, even if that means hopping on the bus and going round trip through the city...

We *tried* and weren't incredibly successful with the technology of the time.  Dropping a dumb bomb from that altitude has certain limitations, given wind, clouds, enemy fighters, flak, and so forth.

The US bombers carried considerably more defensive guns than the British bombers, which favored larger bomb capacity.  So there was a period where US bombers were flying during the day (more-accurate bomb drops, but also more vulnerability to fighters) and the British at night, which I expect might have helped US accuracy during part of the war.

4731,"&gt;The two parties that form the government are the Freedom Party and the People’s Party. During the fall campaign, they vilified refugees, attacked Vienna (the country’s liberal big-city capital), and—less loudly—promised major tax cuts for the rich. This won them a combined 57.5 percent of the vote. Austria thus appears to be the newest member in the Central European club of “illiberal democracy,” as Hungary’s authoritarian leader Viktor Orbán proudly calls it. But the Austrian situation is—for those of us who prefer our democracy liberal—both scarier and less scary than that of its neighbors.
&gt;
&gt;First, the bad news: The leader of the Freedom Party and the new vice chancellor of Austria, Heinz-Christian Strache, has been photographed more than once participating in paramilitary exercises with banned Nazi groups. Newspapers in Munich and Vienna published these photos along with Strache’s case-by-case denials, which usually amounted to vague explanations about “paintball games” that he had not realized were “political.” Also, Strache was once arrested by police in Germany for marching with neo-Nazis there, and he participated in the shouting-down of a performance of Thomas Bernhard’s famous 1988 play Heroes’ Square, which criticized Austria for its failure to deal with its Nazi past. 

If this is the extent of the complaint, I really don't care all that much about it.

There are reasons that I'm not too keen on the Nazis, but frankly, none of those reasons are in the above list.

His political image might be a bad idea.  But this does not equate to Nazi policy.  And this really feels like guilt-by-association.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7n756l/the_far_right_is_now_in_power_in_austria_the_new/drznc8x/,vokegaf,1514708809

The information provided by the accuser does not coincide and her information is also not supported by other evidence. The story she told in court was different from the story she told the police during interrogation.

Also, from what I understand, the woman's description led the police to the wrong apartment building, so they didn't investigate the real crime scene until 10 months later(this supposedly happened in August 2016).

&gt;Classical liberalism is a political ideology and a branch of liberalism which advocates civil liberties under the rule of law with an emphasis on economic freedom. Closely related to libertarianism and to economic liberalism,[1][2] it developed in the early 19th century, building on ideas from the previous century as a response to urbanization and to the Industrial Revolution in Europe and the United States.[3] Notable individuals whose ideas contributed to classical liberalism include John Locke,[4] Jean-Baptiste Say, Thomas Malthus and David Ricardo. It drew on the economics of Adam Smith and on a belief in natural law,[5] utilitarianism[6] and progress.[7]",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7mxh7l/political_position_of_various_goverments_all/drzjgew/,vokegaf,1514700674

In 1890 Ireland was richer than Germany, France, the Netherlands? That doesn't pass the smell test to me.

As it points out, Ireland was primarily agricultural. Two-thirds of Irish industrial output was in what is now Northern Ireland, the rest of the country did not industrialize like the rest of the UK. There was a huge famine in Ireland in the mid-19th century that in the long-term halved the population. The population is still substantially smaller TODAY than it was before that.

Out and about: The EU will ban sets for lead casting in Europe from 2018 onwards. But tradition could be saved.

It belongs to New Year's Eve like Miss Sophie and her butler James, like Böller and rocket, like the glass of sparkling wine at the turn of the year: lead casting. On December 31 of each year, lead is expected to predict the future, but that will be over from next year - the EU prohibits sets for lead-casting containing lead.

As of April, no more sets may be sold that have a lead content higher than 0.3 percent. As the Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk reports , analyzes have shown that the figures for lead casting, however, contain up to 71 percent of the toxic heavy metal.

In lead casting, small lead figures are melted on a spoon over a flame and then placed in cold water. The instantaneous solidification of the material in the water creates bizarre figures which, according to superstition, give the producer, as a kind of oracle, an indication of his fate in the new year.

But lead is a heavy metal and is considered very harmful to health . Even small amounts can lead to disorders of the nervous system, kidneys and liver, especially in children. Through the skin contact with the lead figures, the lead usually enters the body through the mouth. Furthermore, the lead liquefaction releases lead fumes that are absorbed by the body via the respiratory tract. Therefore, the lead sets must be taken out of trading from April.

However, if you do not want to forego lead casting, you can fall back on alternative materials. Thus, the Federal Environment Agency advises ""wax casting"". The wax is silver colored and could be used just like the lead for casting the figures.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7n6d80/eu_makes_molybdomancy_illegal/drze8ou/,rodion_romanowitsch,1514692993

Of course they deregulated but they were also quite protectionist about certain matters. Deregulating job markets was always fine but deregulating buiness structures was a big no-no. Aside from that look at what many top tier politicians in the US actually do a lot of the time they should really spent on governing the country: They fundraise.

4996,"No Ireland was wealthy, but the wealth wasn't distributed evenly. Maybe not as wealthy as London or manchester but there was still considerable wealth. For a time Dublin was the second largest city in the UK and its georgian architecture denoted the wealth that existed during that time period. Ireland was very famous for its ship building especially Belfast, which was one of the largest ship builders on the planet. Serious amounts of wealth but again not well divided. In short Ireland was a comparatively wealthy part of the UK, obviously it was never as wealthy as London but combine in a lower population and high emigration rate for the poor and I can see that a GDP of  5,277 isn't unrealistic. 

To give a modern day example: Equatorial Guinea has a GDP that is similar to modern EU countries such as latvia or even japan if using PPP, reported the highest in Africa. Equatorial guinea is a would be considered a wealthy country relative to its size. However most of the population lives in poverty this isn't because it is poor it is because the wealth is concentrated among a small group of elites. This is similar to Ireland in the 19th century, Ireland was wealthy but many of the Irish were not. Paradox of plenty if you will.

When the UK was formed the term country, even the idea of a country was completely different to what it is today, so I suppose yes, under today's standards England, Scotland, Wales, etc don't cut it as countries. What I'm trying to get at is that there are many in the UK who see themselves as Welsh, or English, etc before being British (that's assuming they do consider themselves British at all), to many (though not all) in the U.K. being British is different to being English or Scottish. I've been to Scotland and Wales and both times I just felt and knew I was in a different country, I was not in England and therefore not in my home country (less so for Wales but that is because my grandfather's family was Welsh). My point is that sure objectively England, Scotland, etc can be considered states but it just doesn't make sense or is just wrong and offensive to many living in the UK, surely these should be the people who get to decide whether England, Scotland, Wales, etc are independent countries not just some arbitrary definition.

The difference with the UK and China is the the UK is a Union, and China is a one party communist state. Scots could have left and thus still can leave the Union. Scots, Welsh, and N Irish move to England just as the English move to the other three. The four nations take care of each other and cooperate. China invaded Tibet. Tibetans have been protesting this for 60+ years. China makes laws to try to fuck the Dalai Lama. Eg there is a law in China that says you can’t reincarnate without the govt’s permission. Some respect the Chinese have for Tibetans. You are trying to compare China and Tibet to the United Kingdom? Are you kidding me?

Yes I am judging Asia for the mongols, among other dicks such as Tamerlane. The difference is that the British were more successful and actually impacted the places they owned. The Mongolia raped, burned, looted, massacred. The British enslaved and were asshole to natives, no denying that. The difference is the scale of the two. The Mongols killed millions over the course of 50 years. The British killed thousands over the course of 200 years. The Indian famine was indirectly caused by the British but that’s a different story. The two don’t compare. The British look like saints compared to the Mongols. 

The Mongols were Russified. They were never part of Russia at any point in history. They were satellites to the Soviets but maintained statehood. The last time Mongolia was part of another country, they were owned by Qing China for 200 years, only being freed from the Chinese in the 1920.  Oof. And don’t try to expel them from east Asia.

Spain isn't rich so yes that money could be going to other things but the extremely heavily reliance on NATO has caused many European militaries to become shockingly inadequate for *any* battlefield, especially a 21st century one. 

Furthermore, the wet dream (for some) of a EU Army will only actually be a thing if EU member states are willing to put in their fair share.

5224,"&gt; Are much too expensive.  

Is likely to change in the future, with all the research being done on this topic (for phones and electric cars etc). Also if electric cars become more popular in Germany, there built in battery's could be used temporary (basically making money for the owner).  
The study has following conclusion:  
-100% Power and Heating Production by Renewable in Germany  
-No additional cost (for power)  
-Takes in account increasing power cost
-No energy exports / imports
-No carbon capture  
-Biomass will be used in combination for Heat and Power  
-Heating energy needs to sink by 50% (better insulation)  
-It requires some form of storage (they are talking about methane storage, using efficiency of that time, 52 GWh (quite alot though))  
-50% electric car Usage

The writer points out that adding power trading would decrease it (but would probably be harder to calculate)  

""Wind output is also linked across Europe. Over the last 5 weeks, wind output in 20 European countries has varied between 75 and 22 GW""  
Thats partially due to most wind power being produced in Germany, the 4th chart shows that wind power in the UK and Spain is quite often higher at the same time when it is lower in Germany. Also, offshore wind is alot more reliable then onshore.  
For Germany 7 (bio gas) and 4.1 (waterpower) GW are produced by dispachable renewable s, more than the UK, but yes still not enough, more Biogas facility's would be necessary.  

&gt; cleaner and safer to just burn gas instead. 
 
Hm how that?  
Ive seen some concepts that are in development for carbon negative Gas power plants.  
&gt; most countries do not have anything like enough hydro  
A lot of Nordic country's have a lot more than they need, they can (and probably already do) help with the storage problem.  

&gt; Biomass using waste mass has fairly high emissions 
 
How that?  
If its biomass it would have decade anyway, thus releasing Methane that is much worse as an Greenhouse gas then CO2. By burning it you can directly feed the CO2 back into the greenhouses (most of them are for farm-byproducts), and use the Heat to warm up some houses.  
&gt;  which is why we are now cutting down forests in the US, shipping the wood across the Atlantic and burning it.  

Didn't know about this, sounds bad, also some farmers here in Germany have started growing plants only for biomass (thus not producing food).  
&gt; However, there isn't sufficient waste biomass to scale up,  

You have a source on this?  
Because I would expect with the amount of Garbage we produce there should be enough.  

Also another point I would like to make:  
You cannot have ""to much energy"", if we start producing so much renewable energy that we meet demand, prices will drop, and people will start doing stuff like mining bitcoin (or the future version of this that actually benefits humanity), with the free energy (like a month ago power-prices in Germany were negative).",European Union,/r/europe/comments/7mx9m6/this_website_shows_in_realtime_where_your/dryxcak/,Arthedain,1514671186

Ok, to be serious, yes, there is racism in Europe, shocker. Unfortunately, this blog entry sabotaged itself because of various points. For me, the strongest was that she seems to be completely unaware of the extreme race obsession and racism in America. 
E.g. there is a reason why they have ""white neighbourhoods"" like hers and it ain't pretty (segregation?!). Also many less informed  people still might have the view that all Americans are white 'cause that's how they market themselves (ever watched the Oscars?). 
I also found it weird how she suddenly referred to some people as ""black"". Did she ask them if they identify more as ""black"" or as ""French"", I wonder.

Huns, Mongols, Pechenegs, Khazars, Ilkhanate, Golden Horde, Turks, Tamerlane, Scythians, etc etc

Attila the Hun, an Asian by descent, was a genocidal fuck who wanted all of Europe (Romans and Germanics) to be his bitch.

Mongols, especially Batu Khan (grandson of Genghis) invaded Hungary, Poland, and Russia, killed more than 25% of the Hungarian population alone, and burned down cities such as Pest. Mongols = Asian.

Khazars berated and invaded the Byzantine Greeks, Bulgarians, Russians, Ukrainians, Caucasians, and Romanians for centuries.

Ilkhanate terrorized the Armenians, Georgians, Byzantines, Syrians, and others for a hundred years.

The Golden Horde, Asians, was the one to **spread the fucking black death to Europe** in the fourteenth century when it was laying a siege of Kaffa, a Genoan city in Crimea. The black death killed 25 million people or more, and it also originated in China. Thanks Asia.

Turks (discounting the Ottomans, who were Turk but not exactly Asian) and Tamerlane terrorized Iranians, Caucasians, Greeks, Syrians, and the sort for a millennia. Tamerlane alone killed **17 million people,** being Asian.

Scythians were the ancient Asians who laid waste to Greek cities for fun.

5256,"&gt;If pigs would speak would I still eat bacon?

That is a perfectly valid question if the subject would be ethics of eating animals. If pigs were able to speak, would one still eat them because ""*they are not human*"" and the cognitive capabilities of pigs are irrelevant, or would one not eat them, because talking demonstrates the kind of cognitive capabilities which warrant personhood and right to live. The question can be used to reveal the underlying premises people have about eating other animals.

Likewise the aim of my question is to reveal underlying premises you have about immigrants and the methods to solve the challenge.

&gt;I frankly don't really see the point of entertaining a dead-end argument.

The point is to see are you categorically against the idea of stopping immigrants, or are you able to imagine a scenario where it is a viable option. The point is that if stopping immigrants would be proven to be a realistic option, how would you react?

What if the idea that it isn't ""realistic at all"" is not a fact, *but your personal belief*?.

Like whereas for you the idea of ""it is realistic to stop immigrants entering the country"" is merely a hypothetical situation, for others it is simply a belief of what is possible. And whereas you say you won't consider the option because it is impossible, others do consider it because for them it is possible. Like you act based on certain beliefs, other people act on other beliefs. And if the difference is whether or not one beliefs it to be possible to stop immigrants entering, then the difference cannot be said to be a difference in ethics. Thus the person saying it is impossible to stop immigrants from entering cannot judge the morals of those who belief it is possible to stop immigrants from entering. There is no difference in ethics demonstrated, only a difference in beliefs about possibilities.

(The argument ""it's no realistic at all"" has been used to dismiss attempts to combat climate change, to gain equal rights for sexual minorities and other pushes for societal change. People who are involved in social movements even have a saying concerning your belief, ""*change seems impossible when you aim for it, but inevitable after it has happened*"".)",,/r/europe/comments/7n0odn/opinion_murder_of_german_girl_will_have_political/dryxlz5/,Toby_Forrester,1514671535

5372,"Let’s look at it this way: When was art NOT “stagnating”. The last truly revolutionary time in art history before modernism was when? It was during the Renaissance, so a while back. One could say the developments in art are tightly linked to technological developments. What would be the next “revolutionary” thing in our age then? VR? AI generated art? I don’t know, but stagnation is not what I would call it. Then there’s the issue of who decides what art is. You seem to talk about some instance that decides what good art is, what is not. But who is that actually? Especially in the age of the internet, where everyone can become their own curator. During the 20th century and before one could have pinpointed the people who decide what is art or not because mass media was relatively centralized back then. Nowadays it’s a very different landscape. But that’s a highly debated philosophical topic that obviously has not one definitive answer. Again, there’s plenty of respectable artist nowadays who are going in a new direction. But there’s so many new things it’s difficult to call something truly new.

Also, it should have had a supermajority to leave the EU, a point that was so obvious nobody felt the need to make it when everyone thought Remain would win.

Most importantly we're a representative democracy for a reason, not really representative as we use First Past The Post but we should always trust our elected betters (except for when they think we should hold a referendum)

People here in Sweden tell stories of how the 70s and 80s were this golden age when jobs were plentiful and society functioned well. The economic crash in the 1990s ended this supposed ""golden age"" and society grew more unequal. 

Much of it is rose coloured glasses talking but the fact is that the wages of the lower middle and working class have stagnated and worst of all there is a lack of job security for the uneducated working class and increasingly even for professionals with tertiary education. Now the problem is worse in america but many of the same symptoms arise in Europe as well.

In your reasoning you implicitly take ""some"" things for granted, like borders.

When you say that it is ok to transfer sovereignity to EU only if 50% of country's population agree to that, you implicitly use definition of who can vote, of what is country, etc.

Why do we need measure 50% of let's say, Czhechia and not 50% of Czechia and Germany?

1. Trans nation Power trading:  
The likelihood of all European nations having low renewable energy production at the same time is significantly lower, so nations can sell power when they produce more than they need and buy when they dont.  
2.  
There are renewable that can be quickly turned off/ on, for example: biomass, hydro power etc.  
3.  
When power need, and with that price changes a lot over the day, large consumers are incentivized to use power when it is abundant, for example a freezer storage of a warehouse could only use energy when it is cheap to save money, as the temperature will stay relatively stable for a while.

&gt; **VI. Gold Shipped Abroad**

&gt; VI/1. Swiss National Bank 389.2

&gt; Swiss Commercial Banks 61.2

&gt; Swiss Banks. The most important recipient of German gold was Switzerland, which was not only able to
sell the Germans vital supplies such as machinery and armaments, but also Swiss francs which were the
only internationally accepted form of foreign exchange. The Swiss banks also served as conduits for
transferring German gold to third parties, especially Spain, Portugal, and Sweden. The Swiss commercial
banks were used by Germany as late as the spring of 1941 to make substantial dollar payments to the
USSR and to the United States, as well as smaller payments to Japan and China.34 Swiss banks received
$450.4 million in gold. Gold shipments to the Swiss National Bank were relatively small at the beginning
of 1940 and reached a peak in 1943. After early, 1943 deliveries to Bern declined rapidly, and no gold
was sent directly to the Swiss National Bank from Berlin in 1945 (though some gold was taken from the
Constance branch of the Reichsbank to Bern). The increased difficulty of selling gold on foreign markets
after the end of 1943 meant that more gold was shipped to Reichsbank branches for use in South-East
Europe. By the last year of the war, Germany's gold holdings were still very substantial, but the German
authorities were less and less able to use them to obtain foreign resources, and the strategic usefulness of
gold declined in consequence.",Republiek der 17 verenigde Nederlanden,/r/europe/comments/7n1bee/gdp_per_capita_in_1890_in_2017_ppp/dryfz3q/,Grofgeschut,1514649974

5674,"&gt;""Germany is saving consumers from their own poor spelling.

&gt;A German court has barred Amazon from drawing in online shoppers who misspell iconic German sandal maker Birkenstock in their Google searches, Reuters reports. Amazon reportedly won business for common Birkenstock misspellings by booking variants like “Brikenstock,” “Bierkenstock,” and “Birkenstok” in Google AdWords, so that they produced search results for shoes sold on Amazon.com.

&gt;According to Reuters, Birkenstock turned to the court because it feared shoppers might unwittingly buy shoddy counterfeits, which could damage its brand reputation. “For us, Amazon is complicit,” Birkenstock chief Oliver Reichert told German magazine Der Spiegel, according to Reuters.

&gt;Birkenstock first walked away from Amazon.com in July 2016. Besieged by counterfeits and rogue merchants, the company said it would no longer supply products to Amazon for US customers starting Jan. 1, 2017. “The Amazon marketplace, which operates as an ‘open market,’ creates an environment where we experience unacceptable business practices which we believe jeopardize our brand,” David Kahan, Birkenstock’s CEO for the Americas, wrote in a memo at the time.

&gt;A year later, Kahan denounced Amazon in a lengthy memo for attempting to get Birkenstock retailers to sell it their inventory, even though the company had explicitly removed its sandals from Amazon.com in the US. “I share in no uncertain terms that this is unacceptable and will not be tolerated,” Kahan wrote. “[A]ny Authorized retailer who may do this for even a single pair will be closed FOREVER.”

&gt;Amazon is a tough internet giant to foil. Its Zappos subsidiary sells a wide array of its offerings, and a search for “Birkenstock” from the US still returns plenty of results on its website, though many of the shoes are also out of stock. Earlier this month, Birkenstock also pulled its merchandise from Amazon in Europe over the online shopping company’s alleged failure to stamp out counterfeits.""",German/Canadian in DUS,/r/europe/comments/7n1o8w/germany_has_ordered_amazon_to_stop_taking/drybdob/,shembop,1514642839

5758,"Oh yes, there are plenty of reasons to want the UK back in.

Where to start ? Britain is a *big* economic player. 50% of British export is absorbed by the EU, and Britain is a key market for many continental corporations. Nobody can tell what would happen should tariffs reappear there.

Then it is the only *other* nation with nuclear weapons and a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Its diplomatic network and military capabilities are (almost) on par with France's. When the foreign policy of the UK isn't aligned with that of the UE, bad things happen to the world.

Last but not least, what do we do with all HM's subjects who made their lives on the continent, and all the EU citizens who call Britain their home ? Some of them even are elected officials or high-ranking civil servants in their adopted country. Their removal isn't going to be a walk in the park.

Indubitably, like any catastrophe, Brexit has a galvanizing and unifying effect on survivors, which can lead to the illusion that Brexit is, all in all, a good thing for the EU. It is not. It is what it is : a continent-wide catastrophe with 550 millions casualties.

5778,"I'll address a few common terrorist threats:

1) Internal splinter groups. 

Historically, us Romanians were split apart in 3 countries by the neighboring empires. Uniting into one country was something we wanted to do since the middle ages and was unable to until WW1. This was ingrained into our culture and ""When there is only one there is no strength, when there are many the strength is rising"" has been a national motto for years. The only active threat in this are is that Victor Orban is actively riling up the Hungarian minority (1.43 mil - 6,5%) which have historically kept to themselves There was a rise of small aggressive acts done by the minority towards ethnic Romanians posted on social media a few years back. 

2) The Middle East

We did go to war, but when we did the declarations were ""We're supporting our allies"" and not ideological ones against them. Our role there was more like a local police, basically *actual peace keeping*, so we didn't get into the spotlight. It's harder to make a straw man out of us.

3) Russia

Being a NATO member kept us safe from the Russian-proxy ones after Russia got it's teeth back in the 2000s. It did not help in the info wars as with other Western countries though.

4) Local culture

a) Romanians don't get riled op too easily. And when we do, we do it peacefully. Both now and in history. In the 2017 February protests 600.000 people took to the streets at their highest, 300.000 only in Victoriei Square in Bucharest. No incidents. The only time when the Gendarmerie had to intervene was on one of the earlier days when there were about 25.000 people in the Victoriei square and the party in power brought football hooligans to provoke violence (this is what they normally do). The protesters did not engage with the hooligans, kept their distance. The hooligans tried to get in a fight with the Gendarmerie and had been shown that their ways are wrong in the way the police knows best. During the protests there was a huge influx of messages in the social media telling people to keep a cool head, and what to do if the hooligans show up again. 

b) We've always been welcoming to strangers compared to our western European brothers and that removes one of the biggest generators of tension. Different was good. Different was awesome. We have always been curious of strangers and put a lot of questions. The only exception is that now with the rise of populism, in certain demographics (55 and older, ex blue color workers) there is an increase of the number of people that distance themselves from this welcoming attitude.

5913,"&gt;In the event we needed to reply to a nuclear attack all the attacking country would need to do is to threaten the USA with a strike to get them to not target them.

Aside from the confusion about the US role in the UK's nuclear weapons capability, I think that you may be misunderstanding the motivations here.

So, there are a few ways in which one might use nuclear weapons.

* Limited use.  In this scenario, one does not engage in all-out attack.  The aim is that the conflict would avoid escalating further: the other side would choose not to respond in turn or lacks the ability to do so.  Examples would be US [deliberate escallation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_response) in 1960s nuclear doctrine:

    &gt;Deliberate Escalation: This phase would be entered when conventional NATO forces were succumbing under the Soviet attack. This was actually expected as intelligence indicated Soviet divisions outnumbered NATO divisions by far. In this phase NATO forces would switch to a limited use of nuclear weapons, such as recently developed tactical nuclear weapons (like nuclear artillery).

    Or Russian [nuclear de-escallation](https://globalsecurityreview.com/nuclear-de-escalation-russias-deterrence-strategy/):

    &gt;In 2000, Russia released an updated military doctrine in which it outlined the concept of de-escalation through a limited nuclear strike. This idea put forth the notion that if Russia were subjected to a major non-nuclear assault that exceeded its capacity for conventional defense, it would “de-escalate” the conflict by launching a limited—or tactical—nuclear strike.

    This would typically be used by the side that is conventionally-weaker, since if it is possible domain a war without it involving nuclear weapons on both sides, countries would prefer to do so.  In the early Cold War, when the USSR had far more conventional forces in Europe, NATO leaned towards this; today, with NATO stronger in conventional forces, Russia leans towards this strategy.

* [Second strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_strike).  This is the ability to counterattack with an unacceptably-damaging strike after one suffers a nuclear strike.  A typical modern-day route for this is having ballistic missile submarines that cannot be found by an attacker: they would survive the strike against the country itself, causing severe damage to the attacker, typically by targeting things like cities.

    When people talk about a ""nuclear deterrent"", they are talking about having the capacity to engage in a second strike and publicly announcing a policy of doing so.  The aim is to deter attacks.

* [First strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-emptive_nuclear_strike).  In this scenario, a country attacks nuclear weapons targets first, trying to destroy the other side's ability to respond and cause unacceptable damage to the attacker.

Countries can have the ability to engage in any of these against certain other countries.  They work very differently.  Weapons to do each of these may have quite different properties.

In a scenario where the US used nuclear weapons first against a nuclear power, one of two things are probably true:

* The US believes that it has the ability to successfully perform a first strike, eliminating the other side's nuclear capability.  In this case, your concern about a response is answered by saying that the intent would be to destroy the ability of a nuclear power to strike back.

* The aim is a limited use, where the goal is to have no response, because the other side is expected to choose not to respond with nuclear weapons (possibly because of fear of a *second strike*).

If you've watched that *Yes, Prime Minister* epsode that's popular on here, [The Grand Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHP_LOtx6Ik), you may have seen Jim Hacker saying that he wouldn't ever use nuclear weapons against the Soviet Union, because it would ""be suicide"".  If that's what you're basing your take off, that the US would not use nuclear weapons because of Hacker's take, I think that you're missing the rationale behind the strategy.  Also, remember that the show is a comedy focusing on interplay of British politicians and British bureaucrats, not a documentary on nuclear doctrine.

The UK probably does not have the capacity to single-handedly perform a first strike against Russia.  The US arguably has a pretty good chance.  I read a paper a while back doing a breakdown of what the US's chances of coming out of a first strike against Russia.  If Russia were at peacetime levels, using the paper's model, the US has pretty good odds of destroying the entire Russian arsenal without being hit back.  Strengthening that argument, the US has made substantial investments in increasing nuclear missile accuracy in the past few decades.  The main use of such capability is a first strike — very accurate placement of nuclear weapons only matters much when trying to destroy heavily-hardened targets, like nuclear missiles in hardened silos.  Russia, with her large arsenal, is the only adversary for which this presently really matters much, so it's a fair bet that the US would like to have first strike capability against Russia and believes this to be an achievable goal.

Hacker would never have launched the UK's weapons in such a first strike scenario against Russia: the UK's arsenal is not large enough to knock out Russia's arsenal and was not built for that purpose.

It may be that there is some other current or future nuclear power for which the UK's arsenal is large enough to conduct a first strike, like Iran.

A second strike is inapplicable.  A country would use nuclear weapons in such a scenario after it has already been attacked and basically destroyed by nuclear weapons.  Hacker was proposing use of nuclear weapons in response to a conventional attack against the UK or some countries to which it has provided security guarantees.  His point was that escallation that would produce an all-in Soviet response would not be worthwhile for the UK, so the weapons would never be used.

The UK does have the ability to conduct a second strike against pretty much any country.  I believe that this is the primary reason that the UK has a nuclear capacity — it is to ensure that she may not be surprise-attacked with nuclear weapons.

The UK famously has each new Prime Minister write a sealed [letter of last resort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_of_last_resort).  If the United Kingdom stops transmitting radio signals and some set of obviously-not-public checks are passed, the commanders of the British nuclear submarines at sea will open these letters and the United Kingdom would, perhaps, with her dying breath, bring down her killer.

*…from hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee.*

Jim Hacker's point, that it's hard to find a line for a country to credibly draw such a line in response, is not an objection to British use of nuclear weapons in a second-strike scenario, since he would not be making that call.  He would have already decided what is to be done.

The final point is a limited use scenario.  For a nuclear power, any use of nuclear weapons in such a scenario would be done with the expectation that there would not be an all-out response from a targeted nuclear power.  Needless to say, this is also a very high-stakes poker game.

However, Hacker's objection misses the point here.  In his scenario, he assumes a full response to his use of nuclear weapons, which would indeed make a limited strike senseless.  In reality, he would be gambling that there would not be a full response.

A point that I've made before and would repeat: *Yes, Minister* is a fun show.  I recommend it.  But it is a comedy.  It is not a documentary.  Some people on here got *particularly* worked up over another line where Sir Humphrey Appleby stated that British membership in the EU exists to weaken France and Germany.  Despite the patent absurdity (what, sitcom writers can see this but French and German intelligence services and foreign ministries were oblivious at British entry?), a lot of people seemed to believe that they'd been let in to the secret perfidity of the Britons.

Sometimes it looks so ancient that people can't tell if it's not something a lot older.

5961,"&gt;Poor resources + healthcare 
Wait, what?! We're pretty based on natural resources, that's why we've been raging about and protesting a few years back. Just to name the biggest: Illegal lumber exploitation by Austrian companies and the whole Gold/Rare earths at Rosia Montana. Healthcare is decent. Not the greatest but it's k. State owned used mostly by the old people and private used by the working class via company to company conventions. You're either not living in Romania, or have been living in a cave and was out of the loop the past 5 years. 

And regarding the terrorist thing, it's because we didn't piss anyone else, just minded our own business. When we go to war, we just declare that ""we're supporting our allies"" and we're not making any political or ideological declarations against those powers we go against. And what we do in those wars is acting like a local police of sort. At the least that's most of what we did in the middle east. And the whole NATO thing helped to keep us safe from the Russian-proxy ones after Russia got it's teeth back in the 2000s. 

&gt;corruption. 

This is what is scaring me though. The shit that's going on in the country with the hits on the justice system right now is just fueling the crazy ones. I hope it stops before it's reaching the boiling point.
