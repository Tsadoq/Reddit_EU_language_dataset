It's right in the sense that Germany did open up the *Stasi* files - every single one of them. 

It's wrong because it wasn't done ""quickly"". In fact, quite the opposite. What Germany did was set up a [government agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi_Records_Agency) on the very day of the German Reunification whose task was to systematically sift through every single page of the Stasi files and provide them to the general public provided that you had ""good cause"" to take a look at them. 

What's a ""good cause""? Research and scientific work; journalism; legal matters (*Stasi* members are barred from holding public office in Germany) or having your name in the database of *Stasi* surveillance targets.

If you can cite one of those reasons, you can view one or more Stasi files, as far as they're already vailable. But there was no such thing as a release of lists ""as is"" to the public. ",Europe,/r/europe/comments/ahitaz/4141_latvians_were_just_outed_as_kgb_informants/eef0tv2/,ColourFox,1547875665

&gt;Am I supposed to care about the 'liberties' of gun owners? Are you one of the wackos who think owning guns is a human right or something?

Gun ownership in Switzerland is a right under the 1997 Weapons act. Deal with it. It is not a privilege.

&gt;Is having legal guns alongside the smuggled AKs somehow decrease crime? Why? Legal guns will mean more guns and therefore more gun crime.

Prove it. The most gun-saturated nations in Europe have some of the lowest homicide rates. Legally owned guns are seldom used in crime. As it stands the vast majority are illegally smuggled in from outside the EU from failed ex-socialist nations. It is made easier thanks to the laughable border controls of Schengen.

In the UK for example, they banned handguns in 1997, and overall and gun homicide rates rose:

324,"Resident Vladimir Putin is trusted by 33.4% of Russians, while his work is approved by 62.1% of respondents. This is evidenced by the results of a telephone survey conducted by the All-Russian Center for Public Opinion Research from 9 to 13 January.

In order to study the trust rating, respondents are asked to name an unlimited number of politicians to whom they would ""entrust the solution of important state issues"". In order to study the approval rating, they are asked if they support the work of a particular politician.

Although the VTsIOM website cites data only from 2006, the head of the center Valery Fedorov previously noted that the historical minimum rating of trust in Putin reached in March 2005 after replacing natural benefits with monetary compensations and then amounted to 45%.

Thus, in January 2019, the figure, as noted by ""Rain"", reached a historic low since Putin's assumption of office in 2000.

At the same time, Putin continues to be the leader of the confidence rating, followed by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu (13.7%), Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (9.3%), leader of the LDPR party Vladimir Zhirinovsky (9.3%), and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev (8.3%).

On 18 January, the Public Opinion Foundation (POM) also published the results of a poll on the dissatisfaction with the government's work. According to his data, in the last month of the Cabinet's activity more than half of Russians, 54% of respondents, and even more people, 70%, heard criticism of him from acquaintances.

The thing with UK and USA is that both do a lot of advertising worldwide and have a big amount of money as a support. Other countries don't have the money, the financial support to do it like USA&amp;UK does it. And don't get me wrong, a lot of good artist are from UK but not many are as good as they are promoted. In my life I've heard music from all over Europe and lots of artists were better than a lot of the ones promoted now by UK, but less popular. 

&gt; we weren‚Äôt head to head with America 50s-90s, we were kings of music.

Okay, I didn't live through all this period but I heard music in the '80 and '90, as I had tapes, records or radio. So then explain to me why  ABBA, Roxette, A-ha, Toto Cutugno, Ramazzotti, Dalida, Joe Dassin etc, lots of american ones like Michael Jackson, and so on and on... were just as popular if not some of them even more popular than UK here? Back then I liked a lot of electronic, I personally  had tapes of Kraftwerk,  Vangelis and Jean Michel Jarre, or Morricone, which I think they were fairly popular  (at least in Europe) back then, along with some from UK like Mike Oldfield. In the '80 a lot of french and italian music was quite popular here, but of course some from UK as well. Then lets not start with the whole '90 period radio,  where I never heard anything else at the radio as much as Enrique Iglesias or Tarkan or... insert non UK artists, while personally I started to incline more towards rock, which some were obviously from UK but lots of them were not.

529,"&gt; and I don't see any reason why countries such as Spain/Portugal/France should be allowed easy access to the North Sea in general. Instead I think it would be far more reasonable to allow the countries around the North and Celtic Sea (UK, Ireland, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and Norway) to form their own policy on fishing. The same could also be done for the countries around the Mediterranean and Baltic Sea.

the reason why countries (or more correctly, vessels) such as Portugal or the Netherlands should be allowed is because THEY PAID FOR IT.

UK vessels have sold their quotas to fishing fleets from other countries, and the British government has allocated most of the fishing quotas to big companies rather than to the vessels of the small fishing communities.

If you disagree with that, then you should complain with the British government , because it;s a situation of its own making. Or to Nigel Farage, who was a member of the EU fisheries commission in charge of overseeing and potentially reforming the CFP, but showed up twice out of more than 20 meetings in his tenure.

Oh, and countries like Denmark, the Netherlands or Belgium have been fishing in British waters for centuries and there is apparently a mechanism in common law where a situation that is left unchallenged becomes de facto a right.

German media, first and foremost the Springer tabloid press, screamed bloody murder when Streetview came to Germany, amplifying [B.S. sentiments](https://bildblog.de/21374/die-schlechtesten-gruende-gegen-street-view/) of people who honestly thought that Streetview would be livestreaming them naked on their balconies.

Even among those who weren't quite that stupid, all of a sudden a notion of privacy was established that included public places and house facades, even though there was and is no law covering that.

If you're wondering what motivated Springer and their ilk to whip people up against Google, I think it's very likely because at that time they were demanding Google to pay them for the inclusion of snippets of their articles in Google News. Google didn't budge (which wouldn't have made any sense anyways since they're driving traffic to the content providers), so I guess this was Springer's way of flaunting their power through disinformation (Springer's daily bread &amp; butter).

591,"I do want the Eurozone economy to converge, but I don't believe a Eurozone budget will achieve that. I think a Eurozone budget will achieve nothing but fighting. Fighing because France can do whatever it likes and use its political clout to get the most money and to get away with breaking the rules. Fighting because the voters in the Netherlands and Germany will be angry if Italy continues to have a 130%+ deficit while their governments promote fiscal prudence. And angry because their retirement age will be 70 or higher and the French and Italians will retire at 65. At that cost, I don't want convergence. I don't believe in it. Juncker and Moscovici have destroyed every last drop of faith I had in the Commission. And the EP, for letting them get away with it. Juncker should never have been president. He is anti-democratic and a drunk. And his remarks about letting France off the hook 'because it is France' are a disgrace. The EP should have fired him for that. Moscovici shows that the Commission will let the big countries off the hook and just stick it to the little ones. The EP should have sent the Commission home over that as well. Instead they do nothing. The EP is a bad joke, only wanting to increase their own power and ignoring anything that is not bringing that goal closer. They let France off the hook because Macron is such ' a good European'. Disgraceful. 

Anyway, Eurozone convergence is not the holy grail. EU countries can work just fine without convergence if needed. And if convergence just leads to angry voters all over Europe, it will solve nothing. Now it's Italy with a Eurosceptic government. Soon we will have a generation of politicians in Germany who have no recollection of the war, and with that probably a lot less reason to act as humbly as they mostly have.

664,"1. No but i am implying that lack of fiscal prudence does cause crises. While fiscal prudence does not.

2. You completely ignore moral hazard. Why would coutries under your model show any fiscal restraint? Why would the netherlands with a retirement age going up to 70 and up have to share fiscal resources with countries having a retirement age of 65? Why would we pay for far more generous unemployment schemes like the belgian or french? Or why would fthe french have to risk paying for dutch mortgage subsidies? 

A fiscal union requires a level of harmonization of national policies that would send shockwaves through all of europe. You think the yellow vests are bad now? Wait until you cut their unemploment benefit duration in half, add stringent work requirements and raise the retirement age to 70. Paris would burn. 

All flaws of the euro disappear if you just make countries carry their own responsibilities  greece should have defaulted. Italy should probably default as well. The only ones clamouring for a fiscal union are the freeloaders. Remember this: socialism only works until you run out of other peoples money to spend.

733,"&gt;Norway and Nordic countries are losing workers rights since the early '90s, and it's not about the EU or anything. 

It does when certain rights and conventions are found to not be in accordance with the EEA agreement, and are struck down by the courts. Often the removal of certain rights have not been caused by domestic politicians removing them, but the courts finding them illegal per the EEA agreement. 

&gt;For the freedom of movement issue, let me point out that Norwegian economy benefits from it, as well as your working class.

Funny you should say that. Yesterday a highly debated and high profile [report](http://ftp.iza.org/dp11904.pdf) was published by Institute of Labor Economics, that found that social mobility was reduced and the poorest among the Norwegian population were left worse off due to immigration. The influx of workers has slowed down wage growth, reduced employment possibilities and increased social dumping. While it may be a net positive for the economy as a whole, it does leave a substantial part of the population much worse off as a result.

He is the one within M5S that seems to be supportive of saving people stranded at sea. But the party has not opposed the actions of Salvini and has submitted to his whims. 

M5S is in favour of several eversive policies, such as the one that an MP should simply carry the will of the party (the so called ""vincolo di mandato""). That is fundamentally anti-democratic.

Actions speak louder than words. If they look like right-wing policies, if they enact right-wing policies, they must be right-wing.

From my perspective, with which of course you'll disagree, I think the Italian left-wing parties have not promised anything that was unattainable. Of course they could not have promised to give money to everybody like M5S did, because they knew it was unfeasible from an economic POV. Have you already forgotten the empasse with Europe?

And it must've been used since Late Old Norse time. It must've started somehow, and maybe the seeds are there in Icelandic to make inofficial sense?

Colloquial Icelandic doesn't diverge much from the official grammars (with some notable exceptions like the subjunctive being used less and the *""new passive""* being fairly common) and famously in stark contrast to Scandinavia and the Faroes dialectification is very marginal. 

At least in modern Icelandic the article being suffixed to the noun is such a hard rule I have a hard time seeing any such forms arising any time soon. The free standing article is hardly ever used anymore so articles are not very flexible. It is perhaps possible this kind of stuff existed at some point in Icelandic but not in 2019 and not in the 13th and 14th centuries (that I'm aware?). Unfortunately I haven't read enough middle Icelandic literature to be absolutely confident but I don't remember ever seeing this before.

856,"It is back to the future, but this time with iPhones and selfies. As thousands of Serbs protest against their president, Aleksandar Vucic, it is easy to recall the heady days of the 1990s when people marched against Slobodan Milosevic. When he fell in 2000, their slogan was ‚ÄúIt is over!‚Äù Today‚Äôs banners proclaim ‚ÄúIt has begun!‚Äù

The number of protesters who have marched for the past six weeks is disputed. But days before a visit by Russia‚Äôs President Vladimir Putin on January 17th, they showed no sign of abating. The protests started after Borko Stefanovic, leader of a small leftist party, was coshed and kicked as he arrived on November 23rd for a meeting in the town of Krusevac. The perpetrators, he says, were thugs connected to a local businessman close to Mr Vucic‚Äôs ruling party. Serbia is a front-runner to join the eu, whose leaders, says Mr Stefanovic, indulge Mr Vucic because they want the Balkans to remain stable and for him to clinch an agreement with Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008.

Mr Vucic‚Äôs critics say he is an authoritarian who controls the national news, especially on television and in newspapers that older Serbs still rely on. Middle-class Serbs in Belgrade, the capital, form the core of the protests, though they have occurred in smaller towns as well. Srdjan Bogosavljevic, a veteran pollster, says his Ipsos monthly data show that 44% of Serbs think the country is heading in the right direction, whereas 33% think the opposite. If Mr Vucic called an election, as he may, 65-75% are thought likely to vote for him or an allied party. Serbia‚Äôs economy grew by 4.4% last year, unemployment has been dropping and foreign investment is flowing in.

Mr Bogosavljevic says that Serbs are less poor than they were, especially outside Belgrade. Still, up to 50,000 people emigrate every year. Ana Brnabic, Serbia‚Äôs prime minister, says no decision has been made to call an election. She says she still has lots to do‚Äîand is ‚Äúalways interested in constructive criticism‚Äù. But the protesters‚Äô complaints are ‚Äúnot based on facts.‚Äù She wants to continue reforms and investments in education and digitalisation.

The leaders of Serbia‚Äôs opposition, who have formed an alliance, do not make speeches to the protesters because they are so diverse that any one of them would be greeted with abuse by supporters of the others. They range from liberals to arch-nationalists. For instance, the enemies of Bosko Obradovic, the leader of Dveri, call him a clerical fascist. He says he is a ‚Äúmodern conservative‚Äù, keen on democracy and family values. He talks of restoring Serbian rule over Kosovo and of uniting in one state with Bosnia‚Äôs Serbs. Mr Vucic, he says, is committing ‚Äúhigh treason‚Äù for talking of a possible exchange of territory with Kosovo‚Äôs Albanians. Mr Obradovic lauds Mr Putin, Italy‚Äôs Matteo Salvini and Hungary‚Äôs Viktor Orban as Europe‚Äôs future: Serbia ‚Äúshould catch this new geopolitical train‚Äù. He and the rest of the opposition would boycott an election, he says.

1253,"You didn't have a referendum to begin with.

Legally, a referendum has to be binding. You had a ""non binding referendum"" which is nothing more than a opinion poll with a large sample size.

On a practical level, proper referendums have multiple requirements as to form. On the most basic level a person needs to know exactly what they are voting for.

The proper language for Brexit as it is now would have been something along the lines of: Do you vote for Leaving the European Union, to be defined as the relinquishing of membership rights and full obligations, to be replaced by any deal negotiated by government and ratified by Parliament or if no deal is made, the severence of all treaties with the EU (list of treaties) and all treaties negotiated by the EU for the benefit of the UK as an EU member (list)? 

And even this version would be a bad joke in any country that has actual referendums, since its still not saying much of anything. Even the Scottish referendum that required a full white paper was lacking as it fell short of going through every reasonable opinion. That is to say, it did not outline Scotlands goals in case of finding it self in isolation, out of the UK and the EU. 

But of course, that's still infinitely preferable to ""Do you like Brexit?"" Yes, No

Countries that run real referendums, also don't have any of the issues you note since they have formal rules as to how a referendum can be called (usually the people need to collect a certain number of signatures over a limited time span, be it weeks or the time between two regular elections) and there are rules as to the time frame in which a law passed, struck down or altered via referendum can't be re addressed, by the legislature or the people. Usually 6 to 18 months. 

I see plenty of posts like this and it strikes me as absurd every time that people with access to the Internet would start expressing worry about potential issues to the very fabric of democracy because of issues that have been examined, tested and addressed a hundred times over. You might as well start a serious Internet discussion about the danger posed by having a government not appointed by a monarch or the potential lethality of spending hours in a pressurised cabin tens of thousands of feet in air.

&gt;In Europe, it was customary and recognized in evaluation procedures for plant protection products that, following critical evaluation, assessment authorities would also integrate relevant passages of documents submitted by applicants into their assessment reports as long as these were up to standard. For the overall assessment of the scientific work of the authorities, quantitative percentages of the share of the official work are not relevant. Decisive is the quality of the critical review by the authorities of the applicant's dossier and scientific literature. The BfR did not in any way adopt the applicant's conclusions without first assessing their validity. In accordance with its statutory mandate, the BfR reviews the originals of all reported studies. Critical remarks from the BfR are contained within the RAR. The sole criterion for the consideration of study results is the scientific quality and evidence of the studies themselves. Possible interests of the applicants, politics or other interest groups cannot and must not play any role in a scientific assessment. The BfR rejects all accusations of deliberate deception.

Moreover, there is no risk to the EU in putting in place a trade agreement with the EU in the interim, it's not as though there are many other EU members in anything like the position the UK is (large economy, diverse (as in not purely EU focused..) trade, outside of Schengen and the Euro etcc) so the risk of the EU losing potential or existing members is pretty slim.

* The land is muddy and unstable, making building on it difficult.  You've been to a farm before?  It's not only crops, but they have buildings on it to hold workers, machinery and warehouses.

* The river floods all the time, and the communities around it have their street full of water for months at a time.

* There are few roads in the Amazon; just google ""state of amazonas"" and check in the map if you'd like.  The biggest city in the state (Manaus, 2.6 million people) only have three roads connecting it to the outside world.

* There isn't a single bridge crossing the Amazon; if you're anywhere on the north of the Amazon river you can't drive south to the rest of the country without taking a ferry.  

* The soil in the Amazon is comparatively infertile and you can't really get much out of it in terms of crops

* Only 1.8% of Brazil's 209 million people lives in the State of Amazonas, which is the biggest in the country because it is so expensive to build roads, bridges and rail lines in that area.  Again, check Google maps and see for  yourself how few roads there are.

Cons: alcohol first, if you need to buy it, the SS-system ask you an additional ""check"" (ID, Fiscal Code, NHS card...) aka, is slower than cashier's facial check (remember, in Italy, you can buy any type of alcohol only if you are 18...) and even the cashier's at SM can deny you if you don't show a VALID EU ID/passport whatever... you must be 18 or they not gonna sell you anything alcoholics.

I think the ground where companies operate is so complex that the amount of huge companies a country has cannot be attributed that easily to the economy of the country.

And we Finland had Nokia, and Nokia failed not because our economy failed, but because the company made bad decisions independent of our economy. So how companies originate from countries cannot be really used as a straightforward indication of the economic developement. 20 years ago we had Nokia and Samsung was not that big.

Oh God. How about [this much-distributed official Spanish textbook from 1939](https://fr.scribd.com/document/91710095/CATECISMO-PATRIOTICO-ESPANOL-1939) as proof?

(""The enemies of Spain are seven: liberalism, democracy, judaism, masonry, **capitalism**, marxism and separatism."")

1574,"&gt; I was arguing at the very start of negotiations that all the components of the negotiations should run in parallel, attaching a cash payment amount to any items that were lopsided, and at the end, have a period to just agglomerate all the items, so that no one sticking point kills the deal ‚Äî as much as possible is agreed-upon.

What killed that was the ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"" mantra which was repeated endlessly by both sides. That essentially forces sequencing because then you have to severely limit ""everything"" to get it done within two years. It's what will happen for the next part, once trade negotiations actually start. As was pointed out right at the beginning, it would have been best for the UK to simply offer 7-10 years EEA for the withdrawal agreement and then immediately move on the trade agreements, which then could have been done in parallel, without time pressure.

I disagree with the cash amounts in trade agreements, that's extremely rare since there is no way you can balance a competitive advantage in an industry for an indefinite period into the future with a cash payment now.

But you're missing the primary benefit of sequencing for the EU: the withdrawal agreement and trade agreements fall under completely different categories of EU law (trade agreements are an EU competence, the withdrawal agreement is not). The sequencing make the process robust against legal challenges to the ECJ. And there is no shortage of citizens of the UK and elsewhere who want to bring Brexit related cases to the ECJ for judgement.

&gt; Then, the UK is going to do the only sane thing, and assume that the EU will demand as much as it can under the backstop ‚Äî to do otherwise would be irresponsible of the British negotiators.

This time pressure is completely the wish of the UK who want to be out as soon as possible and placing an artificial time limit on negotiations is a good way to screw yourself. Everybody knows you can't do a comprehensive trade agreement in three years, yet somehow the UK continues to pretend it can. So of course the EU wants an insurance policy.

1576,"Native speakers almost never disagree on which article to use, at least in actual conversation (source: am native speaker). It's not that bad if you can understand the differences.

""The"" vs. ""a/an:"" ""The"" refers to something specific. You want to reference a specific house, like one in front of you with white paint? That's ""the house."" You want to talk about houses in general, not any specific, exact house? That's ""a house."" There are some colloquial exceptions (""walking down **the** street"") but they're rare. For example, say you're looking for a certain phone, your sister's iPhone 8. That would be **the** phone or **the** iPhone. But if it wasn't any *specific* phone, if it was just *any* iPhone 8, that would be **a** phone.

""a"" vs. ""an:"" Contrary to what most people will tell you, ""an"" is not simply used for words that start with vowels. It's used for words that start with vowel **sounds**, with the exception of long ""u."" A great way to illustrate this is with acronyms starting with S. Take SAM, for example. If you say the letters individually, you get ""ess ay em."" If you say it like a word, you get ""sam."" So if you were to say the letters by name, you would use ""an"" because the letter S starts with the ""e"" vowel sound. ""An S-A-M."" If you say it like a single word, though, you would use ""a"" because ""sam"" starts with the ""s"" consonant sound. ""A sam.""

The exception to that, as stated earlier, is the long ""u"" sound. You say ""a universe,"" never ""an universe."" But the short ""u"" is normal - ""an umbrella.""",,/r/europe/comments/agv0fv/articles_in_european_languages/eeb2yk2/,Odobenous,1547763923

And yours is full of little green men, unicorns and sensible proggressives. Oh wait, if stranger on internet say something it don't have to be true just because he really believe in that...

&gt; it's just an objective fact,

ROTFL. Whatever you say...

""People, do we have doctor here? We got a meltdown up here""

&gt; I'll let you know a secret: I haven't even read any of your replies

No shit, Sherlock. And of course I didn't mention that...

&gt; I'm just trying to get you to answer my questions pretty much copy/pasting the same post over and over again - and surprised you haven't even noticed it, which only speaks volumes about how blinded you are with hate and contempt towards others.

No you just used the most primitive eristic trick and you complain that I didn't take a bait. Come on, it COULD work on some kind of person intimidated by your smart ass aura but some people are just above such shit.
To repeat for mentally challenged, ""Why did you kill your mother and how much enjoyment did you get from doing so?""

&gt; You're too embarrassed about having been cornered and put in the spotlight, aren't you.

ROTFL, ""Yes sir, I'm stupid and your sharp mind intimidates me"" /s

&gt; I know that

Do you see unicorns and fairies, too?

&gt; I've seen hundreds of similar people like you in my life, online and offline, and I know you won't answer, because it's pretty inconvenient and would lay bare the truth about you

Yep, sure, exactly like you wrote.

&gt; you prefer to keep up the facade rather than face the uncomfortable reality.

Do you have a mirror? I suggest to use it from time to time.

&gt; But I'll reiterate, just for the sake of the discourse: where does the negativity and hate come from, man? Did you ever try to answer this to yourself? Did you ever try to stop and perhaps change, be more positive, enjoy people and life a bit more? Did you ever go out, try and find a hobby and make your own life better?

So, ""Why did you kill your mother and how much enjoyment did you get from doing so?""

&gt; Each and every reply you make, to me or anyone else, is just further confirmation and evidence that I'm onto something. 

Yes, you are under the influence but I would complain to the dealer if I'd were you. That stuff is nasty.

&gt; where does all this negativity in you, the aggression in you and the urge to vent so much of it built-up come from exactly?

Probably fallout from contacts with morons. Fortunately it passes by but they must live with themselves all the time.

&gt; Do you really have nothing else and better to do in life than go after people, most of them who you don't even know and have no remote relation to, disparage, belittle and smear them?

What? You are just speck in my life, don't flatter yourself.

&gt; What's the actual reason and why not just channel this energy you have and you put to try and inject so much vitriol into people's lives into something positive, nice, that would make the world better, instead?

Life is not full of flowers and nice, cute puppies. Man has to face evil, sometimes so that it does not creep across the Earth.

&gt; Life has taught me one thing: happy and fulfilled people have no intrinsic need to belittle others, they're too busy enjoying themselves and their happy lives to try and temporary elevate their beaten-up and bruised self-esteem at the expense of others.

The perfect recipe for small, malicious Hitlers to spread across the Earth. Not on my guard!

I also imagine this mechanism as being a gradual thing with warnings and cuts in increments and discussions and so on, it would be a terrible idea to just go from 100% to 0% in one go :) I'm just supporting the idea of EU pushing stronger against the more corrupt countries, it can be done in a good way and many bad ways. But I think the EU can do it in a good way.

It could also be by earmarking money for education/training of policemen, other law enforcers, for instance. In some East European countries policemen are terribly educated.

&gt;Companies from eastern europe are not always threated fairly, for example polish company Ursus(producer of tractors and other heavy vehicles) is trying to expand toward western markets(Germany, France, Italy and so on) and yet for some reason western countries make it harder for them by demanding from them additional homologation, even though there are same standards in whole EU, and Poland doesnt create problems like those for companies from western countries.

TBH I think many East Europe countries exagerete all the problems they have, and imagine West Europe countries never ever have problems with the EU.

I think all countries have ""situations"" with the EU from time to time. Like Italy just got their entire budget refused, it's a bit more tough treatment than Poland is getting over the Ursus thing.

In my country Denmark we also have EU problems from time to time. But we don't go thinking EU is a conspiracy against Scandinavian countries or something, and we are getting second class treatment.

1676,"&gt; So, by your logic, would that also not mean there there is a heavy push on anti GMO + anti monsanto astroturfing by groups that benefit from outlawing GMO's or roundup, or through lawsuits involving roundup, especially since lawsuits are won by public opinion over science. 

If you look through reddit, twitter and elsewhere you'll see that most of the anti-GMO astroturfers argue against glyphosate itself, which they're convinced is very dangerous. They're also usually against any form of GMO. Yes, these people exist. But there aren't backed by big money, if that's what you're implying.

There are also some legitimate concerns with the overuse of pesticides and multinationals like Monsanto pushing their GMO-herbicide combos on farmers worldwide. As always in these threads, all of that gets mixed up buy people on both ""sides"" with little expertise. 

&gt;After all, claiming of corporate or government astroturfing is now a popular war cry of anti science groups such as flat earthers, anti vaxxers, anti GMO, and similar. 

You know, I work in science myself. I regularly see people *defend* science here on reddit with faulty arguments, bad practise and just general ignorance. I'm not talking about paid shills now. There's a lot of people who believe in science like it's some kind of cult, and will gang up on people in questioning stuff regardless of if they have any understanding of the topic at all. That's not what science is about - that's the complete opposite!

&gt;After all, here you are claiming that monsanto is somehow suppressing scientists who ""refuse to be bribed"" , as if that is something realistic.

I've provided the links. Actually there are hundreds on news articles on this. I guess you're young and have no idea yet how things work in the real world. A company like Monsanto can put up a lot of pressure if they want. [They can get people fired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Akre). They're harrass researchers who publish papers critical of their products and run media campaigns to label them as conspiracy theorists. It's all in the links above, you just have to read. And these are sourced and confirmed cases!

As for the study and the high doses you criticise I agree with you there. Here is a better study with much lower doses: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1257596/

They conclude:

&gt;Our studies show that glyphosate acts as a disruptor of mammalian cytochrome P450 aromatase activity from concentrations 100 times lower than the recommended use in agriculture; this is noticeable on human placental cells after only 18 hr, and it can also affect aromatase gene expression. It also partially disrupts the ubiquitous reductase activity but at higher concentrations. Its effects are allowed and amplified by at least 0.02% of the adjuvants present in Roundup, known to facilitate cell penetration, and this should be carefully taken into account in pesticide evaluation. The dilution of glyphosate in Roundup formulation may multiply its endocrine effect. Roundup may be thus considered as a potential endocrine disruptor. Moreover, at higher doses still below the classical agricultural dilutions, its toxicity on placental cells could induce some reproduction problems.

Like I've written in earlier posts there are many more studies coming to a similar conclusion and I'm not going to do your homework for you, it appears you know how to use a search engine. Have a better look at it, the evidence overwhelmingly points to Roundup posing a risk!

&gt;What is the alternative to things such as roundup then, and things that use glyphosate.

And we've come full circle with the faulty logic again: Roundup can't cause cancer because *there isn't any better pesticide*. Citation for that claim very much needed, btw. ",Germany,/r/europe/comments/agipcc/weedkiller_roundup_banned_in_france_after_court/eeariza/,giraffenmensch,1547756459

Around 40% of the Danish fishing fleet‚Äôs total catch comes from the 200-mile zone which Britain would control if it was not in the CFP, and some Danish fishing communities rely entirely on catching fish within the bounds of what used to be Britain‚Äôs territorial waters.

Brussels, London (dpo) - Just like that! With the UK apparently unable to bring about its planned two-year exit from the European Union, the other Member States have now decided to take a different, more straightforward path: they want to carry out a so-called EUxit.
And this is how the EUxit works: Just in time for the actual Brexit meeting on March 29, 2019, all EU members except Great Britain will leave the EU in a closed manner and then found a new confederation of states. The EU will then only consist of Great Britain.
The other states form the European Alliance (EA), which will function exactly the same as the EU except for the new name. 
""This hiccup paralyzes our institutions and must finally come to an end,"" justifies European Commission President and designated European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker the drastic measure. ""And if that's the only way to make a clean cut, then we'll do it that way."" He promised, however, that the EA would strive to maintain good relations with the EU.
Should the British still want to leave the EU after EUxit as the only remaining EU state, this should not be a major hurdle. After all, they could then negotiate with themselves extremely favorable exit conditions, without having to expect resistance from Brussels.

It's not even a personal attack, so don't try to misconstrue and reframe it as such in an attempt to derail the discussion - it's just an objective fact, I mean, [the proof is in the pudding](https://www.reddit.com/user/Robcio12345) and everyone can see it. 

Poor attempts to try and touch a nerve and make people flip out - you're not good enough to make me flip out, though, keep this in mind - or just to vent on some unreachable, distant, far-away figures that make you allegedly angry, despite never _actually_ crossing into your life and having no direct relationship with you. 

**I'll let you know a secret**:  I haven't even read any of your replies, I'm just trying to get you to answer my questions pretty much copy/pasting the same post over and over again. You're too embarrassed about being cornered and put in the spotlight, though, aren't you. I know that, I've seen hundreds of similar people like you in my life, online and offline, and I know you won't answer, because it's pretty inconvenient and would lay bare the truth about you and you prefer to keep up the facade rather than face the uncomfortable reality.

But I'll reiterate, just for the sake of the discourse: where does the negativity and hate come from, man? Did you ever try to answer this to yourself? Did you ever try to stop and perhaps change, be more positive, enjoy people and life a bit more? Did you ever go out, try and find a hobby and make your own life better?

Or are you just really not seeing all the bilge and rancour you're literally just simmering with? Each and every reply you make, to me or anyone else, is just further confirmation and evidence that I'm onto something. The last one is no different, and somehow I feel that the next one won't be any different, either.

So - where does all this negativity in you, the aggression in you and the urge to vent so much of it built-up come from exactly? 

Do you _really_ have nothing else and better to do in life than go after people, most of them who you don't even know and have no remote relation to, disparage, belittle and smear them? 

What's the actual reason and why not just channel this energy you have and you put to try and inject so much vitriol into people's lives into something positive, nice, that would make the world better, instead?

Life has taught me one thing: **happy and fulfilled people have no intrinsic need to belittle others, they're too busy enjoying themselves and their happy lives to try and temporary elevate their beaten-up and bruised self-esteem at the expense of others**.

1844,"&gt; But that is not the same as saying that it is not an issue.

Seemed clear to me that 'non-issue' refers to something that will only happen if the main discussions have already failed. Unless you are planning to fail, precluding a deal by getting hung up on the contingency is foolish. Especially since there's very good reason for it.

&gt; But in practice...Obviously, that raises red flags for the UK.

I don't really understand this paragraph's argument. 

The trade deal the UK wants is contingent upon the UK settling its withdrawal amicably. The trade deal is totally voluntary on behalf of the EU, and hence one would not expect it to enter into discussions if the actual divorce is bitter and protracted. NI was disputed territory between RoI and UK for many years, with that dispute being settled through the GFA, such that the people of NI get to figure it out for themselves. So if the UK's decision calls into question the continued existence of that solution, it's totally reasonable to expect that particular issue to be covered by the withdrawal agreement. The UK would prefer to solve the problem through a trade deal, which we're fine with, but the trade deal is voluntary and we want to ensure that if it doesn't happen there's a default solution in place. 

If the UK is showing that it cannot leave on terms that are amicable with Ireland by committing itself to protecting the NI status quo, then there is zero reason why it should get its preference to address the problem via trade talks. 

&gt; My guess is that RoI's preference ordering looks like this:...

You're kind of insinuating we have ulterior motives we don't have. We're not hoping the UK just hands over NI to us. Some Republicans wish for this in their fantasies, but I have never heard of even a hint of this in any public discussions. To be honest, it's not certain that the Republic is ready yet for unification. A significant number of people have real apprehension about NI joining the Republic. A lot of this is down to money, and some of it is down to not wanting to deal with what would be the unionist problem and all the hate that would come along with it. 

What we really want in NI is just for everything to stay the same. No borders, no checks, no political pressure, no violence, etc. And some day, if NI is ready, some NI Secretary can call the vote, and then we can take on the rest. 

In terms of a trade deal, really all Ireland wants is for the issue of the NI border not to be an impending threat to the talks. 

The rest of your argument is really non-applicable speculation. Both parties will offer the other one the version of a trade relationship that benefits them most while giving up the least. Then the two can min-max and hopefully eventually produce something that they both can live with. There's nothing nefarious or trickery involved in this, it's regular auld negotiations.

The matter of how the UK's exit of the EU affects NI being something that turns everything toward the worst possible outcome is absurd. As a signatory to the GFA, an internationally recognised agreement, the UK has an obligation to provide a solution whether we can arrive at a trade deal or not. The basic idea that without a CU/SM a border would require checks and enforcement is not in and of itself a controversial idea. It's a reasonable priority on both sides of the border to ensure that laws are followed. Building a border itself (the physical manifestation) is a real problem for Ireland that can't simply be ignored. So that if you know that leaving the CU/SM is going to cause a border that causes a problem, then you've a responsibility to address it. 

Instead what we have is this late-stage argument that the whole border thing is a sham and a willful sidestepping of the issue of what happens to the border in NI outside the CU/SM. So the UK is going to live with a giant smuggling zone in NI? So the Republic is going to live with the same? So it's okay for the UK to force a conflict between the EU and RoI over a border the Republic cannot politically build? 

It is far better for the backstop to be placed in the Withdrawal Agreement, and for it to cause a No Deal result overtly than for it to be glossed over, only to manifest if the negotiations for the trade deal fail. If the UK is going to fail the GFA and NI, it's not likely it will behave better with the EU in future deals.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/agjk8p/donald_tusk_says_brexit_deal_looks_impossible/eea43d6/,the_straylight_run,1547741659

1847,"&gt; You know what is difference between proof and opinion?

Yes. Your statement about Spain being a ""**capitalistic** dictatorship"" under Franco was an opinion. Please provide proof.

As for early Francoism leading to horrific economic hardship, [there's plenty of proof, even in anthropometric data](http://revistes.ub.edu/index.php/HistoriaIndustrial/article/viewFile/21214/23064):

&gt; Hunger and infant malnutrition affected large sectors of  society during 
early Francoism, as has recently been confirmed by historical epidemiologi-
cal  studies,  supported  by  infant  anthropometric  data.[39] The  fall  in  stature among  draftees  in  the  1930-1950  period  is  related  to  a  loss  of   economic well-being, especially the fall in private consumption, which dropped sharply between 1935 and 1950; per capita consumption did not recover to previous levels until 1956.[40] Calorie consumption data reveal the severity of  the alimentary depression undergone between 1935 and 1960, according to different estimates (Figure 3). After the advances achieved in the first third of  the twentieth century, owing to the increased availability of  animal protein, between 1933 and 1960, caloric intake decreased by 5.2% according to Pujol and Cuss√≥ (2014) and 9.9% according to Gonz√°lez de Molina 
et al. (2013). The most dramatic drop in caloric consumption, however, took place in the 1940s, when daily calorie intake fell to 2,209 kcal/day in 1940 and 2160 kcal/day in 1950, more than 25% below the 1930-35 levels.[41]
The lowest estimated data for energy, protein and micronutrient consumption correspond to the mid-1940s.[42] Meat, milk and dairy products, as well as 
fish, were the hardest to come by during this period of  economic autarchy. 
Economic policies led to rationing, a scarcity of  basic products and the rise 
of  the black market (estraperlo). Alimentary shortages were aggravated by the 
restricted supply of  water and energy, the sharp fall in wages and the deteri-
oration  of   labour  conditions.[43] Food  consumption  levels  dropped  to  nineteenth-century levels, [44] and 1930 calorie intake levels were not reached again until 1960. Only after that year did the consumption levels of  the most characteristic  foodstuffs  of   the  nutritional  transition  ‚Äî  meat,  milk  and  dairy  products  ‚Äî  increase  significantly  in  Spain.  Convergence  with  European standards took place in the 1980s.

""Read books"" is of course always a high quality argument.

&gt;In it is written that Estonian GDP per capita was 80% of Finlands GDP per capita in 1937. Or maybe we just think differently about term ""on par"".

So this one writes GDP per capita being 80%. The one listed above had it at 105%. So what gives? It's just rather difficult to measure pre-war wealth levels.

Sure, but the P√§ts Era at least in economic terms is generally considered successful.

1884,"&gt; But a warcrime is a warcrime no matter how justified that is, two wrongs don't make one right.

Bombing cities in 

&gt;Can't you see how similarly it is ? The comment that I was replying to is just saying something I would think that goebbels would have said, you just have to change one country.

Yes I can see how you could use the exact same words to justify bombing Warsaw in 1939 as Germany as you could bombing Hamburg in 1943 as the allies.

You have to have the maturity and the moral courage to look at the context of each and decide which is right, if both are right, or if neither are right.  You can't be a coward and focus solely on the act of bombing itself, you have to look at the reason, and not just the reason the perpetrators themselves give you but look beyond that as well. 

&gt;You are the type of person that would have fitted right into 1939 germany.

Go fuck yourself.  You can see the difference between using violence to conquer the world and impose a totalitarian ideology based on racial hierarchy and enslavement, and using violence to stop that power.  You can see that, but you're too cowardly to take a complicated moral stance about when violence is justified and when it is.  You want the simple and childish notion that its wrong all the time, that there is no justification for bombing a city ever.  Well that doesn't fit into reality dude, luckily allied planners weren't as cowardly as you.

&gt;I don't get where you got that from but the allies where not as bad as the Axis/Nazis.

I'm literally using the same justification given by allied planners, and you're telling me over and over that I'm basically a Nazi.  You are equating the allied powers with the Nazis. 

Look at these quotes, ""I do not personally regard the whole of the remaining cities of Germany as worth the bones of one British Grenadier. It therefore seems to me that there is one and only one valid argument on which a case for giving up strategic bombing could be based, namely that it has already completed its task and that nothing now remains for the Armies to do except to occupy Germany against unorganized resistance.""

""the aim of the Combined Bomber Offensive...should be unambiguously stated [as] the destruction of German cities, the killing of German workers, and the disruption of civilized life throughout Germany.""

Are these the quote of a Nazi? Obviously not.  Do they sound Nazi-esque to you because you refuse to see beyond the singular act of bombing and avoid the wider context? Then you're equating the allied powers and the Nazis.


 You are a weak-willed little child who lacks the courage and moral fiber to step out and say that sometimes heinous and grand acts of violence are justified in order to stop an even greater tragedy.  I'm sorry the world doesn't allow you to exist in a bed of rainbows and flowers but in the real world sometimes there are hard choices to be made.  Choices like, do we bomb German cities in order to degrade enemy war-making capability OR do we not and thus sacrifice more of our own soldiers in conquering Germany and extend the war for even longer.

You don't have the courage to acknowledge that is the real choice, you want to talk about morality and war crimes and ""innocent civilians"" like a child.  But that is the real practical choice you face, and you can't even acknowledge it.  I wonder if you were a British or American or Russian soldier and that choice directly impacted your chances of survival.  Would you feel the same about sparing German cities if it meant the war went on for another 6 months? Another year? Another two years? How many tens of millions more need to die by the Nazi War Machine until you're ready to bomb a city?  And lets not forget those soldiers are innocents too, they didn't start this war.  But you're ready to sacrifice more of those innocents to save some other innocents in the aggressors' cities supporting the aggressive war effort.

Don't you see that? Don't you see how your simple-minded ideas don't fit into this reality? You are completely detached because you're a sheltered little child who's had the luxury of growing up in a  peaceful age and so developed your childish notions about war.

Tell me straight up that you'd rather more allied soldier die in the war, innocent soldiers who did nothing wrong themselves but were nonetheless drafted and volunteered to stop an evil madman, in order to hopefully save more German civilians.  I say hopefully of course because who knows how many would have died in taking these cities one by one, we all know how easy urban warfare was in WW2 and how cities weren't as badly damaged during urban conflict as they were during bombings right?

Tell me that's your choice, at least have the courage to accept the consequences for the decision you are saying they should have taken.  I've accepted the consequences of mine, civilians died, children died, people who weren't even factory workers died, I acknowledge all of it but I think it was worth it to bring the war to a quicker end and save the lives of our soldiers.  Now can you acknowledge the consequences of your decision?

Growing up I was taught that the only way to get a decently paying career and not be stuck stacking shelves in a supermarket was to get a university degree.

1938,"&gt;The US is an ally, Russia is an enemy. 

Russia is a European country that borders several others. US is a country other side of the planet. It makes no sense to have the biggest European country as an enemy just for the sake of it... Europe should stand together, and not divide itself by being useful idiots for Americans. 

Another solution is obviously the destruction of Russia. Operation Barbarossa 2.0 and the complete dismantling of the Russian state and the Russian people. But that would be extremely costly and morally questionable, and I think cooperation is still the better solution. 

Outsourcing our defense to Americans, making Russia more hostile and just maintaining the Status Quo is not a solution of any kind however. 

&gt;With Trump in power, Russian enmity was projected through the US, but Trump will not last and the US - EU alliance will remain.

And why exactly should it remain? Because it's so much fun to have tens of terrorist attacks because US destabilized the entire Middle-East? Because it's so much fun to have hundreds of thousands of refugees entering Europe for the same reason? Because it's so much fun to have a hostile Russia because US wants to contain them with NATO? Because it's so much fun to be a bunch of hypocrites who proudly call out other countries for their human rights abuses and aggression, while completely closing their eyes from USA's perpetual war?

&gt;You do have a point, Trumputin has done a lot of damage to the Western Alliance.

And that is a good thing. Our alliance with the US is not any state of nature. It's a relic from the Cold War. It's a relic that is dividing Europe and enabling American aggression. It's a relic that enables American cultural imperialism and consumerism, which destroys the environment, the culture and even us as people.

2013,"*Le Monde, 16th january 2019*

&gt; **For David Dufresne, a specialist in the field of policing, the repression of ""yellow vests"" ""will leave its mark on a whole generation"".**

&gt;Brain hemorrhage of a 47-year-old man in Bordeaux, facial trauma of a demonstrator in Toulouse, fracture of a high school student's forehead in Orl√©ans... Writer and documentary filmmaker David Dufresne, author of the investigation Maintien de l'ordre (Policing, Fayard, 2013), identifies and reports police blows observed during the demonstrations of the ""yellow jackets"". He denounces the ""political and media denial"" of this violence, which he considers deeply ""anti-republican"".

&gt;**What is the particularity of policing management in France?**

&gt;David Dufresne: For a long time, France was considered the champion of policing, for one simple reason: in the face of particularly large demonstrations in the country, the police are trained. Except that today it is a myth, which has collapsed before our eyes. Over the past decade or so, policing has become extremely offensive, brutal, with police officers going into contact. Until now, the key has been to show your strength so you don't have to use it.

&gt;In Germany and England, the police forces have set up a whole process of dialogue with demonstrators and de-escalation. France has made the opposite choice, from which these tragedies stem: about 2,000 demonstrators have been injured since the beginning of the ""yellow vest"" movement in mid-November.

&gt;For example, France uses weapons banned elsewhere in Europe for this type of intervention, and considered by some manufacturers as weapons of war: defence bullet launchers [Flash-Ball' are part of this family, but are only used by certain municipal police officers], GLI-F4 grenades, which contain a small dose of TNT and tear off hands. These are all the more dangerous because they are not lethal and are therefore used on a massive scale by police officers who believe, in good faith, that they will not kill. But we are witnessing serial mutilations, which are a disgrace to French-style policing. The myth, on which politicians continue to surf, does not stand up to the facts.

&gt;**You do a casualty count, what is your objective?**

&gt;This census was based on an astonishment effect in the face of police violence and political and media silence. It is a documentary filmmaker, police observer and whistleblower approach. I try to contextualize the images I see as best I can. More and more, victims or their families send me information directly. I report to the Ministry of the Interior not only violence, but also breaches of police ethics. Anyone who is injured in the face can file a complaint because, as explained in law enforcement manuals, it is prohibited to aim at the head.

&gt;Of the 300 reports recorded [on his Twitter account], I count at least 100 seriously injured, including about 15 people with their hands cut off and several others torn off, but also insults and threats launched by police officers or even the destruction of mobile phones. The 2005 riots took place every day, every night, for three weeks, and they caused fewer spills than the weekly ""yellow vest"" demonstrations.

&gt;**What do you remember about the silence around police violence?**

&gt;Today, it is no longer silence, it is denial. Mr. Castaner himself [the Interior Minister], Monday evening, explains that he does not know ""any police officer who has attacked a ""yellow vest"""": we are in the state lie. There is a lot of police violence, it is very serious. It was not until October 1961 that such an outburst was achieved - without comparing the current situation with the deaths of the repression in the Charonne metro and the Algerians thrown into the Seine.

&gt;The Republican police cannot shoot the crowd without being held accountable. But I have received some minutes of the hearing at the IGPN [Inspectorate General of the National Police]: it will do its job of stifling. However, 78 complaints are being investigated, much more than during demonstrations against the 2005 labour law or riots, which shows the extent of the damage. There's a police embarrassment.

&gt;Media silence is also part of the violence, as evidenced by the testimonies I have received. The police also allow themselves these blows because there is no media coverage. This political and media denial is anti-republican.

&gt;**What is the link between politics and policing?**

&gt;This link is explained by history. France is a contested country. The national holiday is the taking of the Bastille, a riot. For the maintenance of order, the police act on political order. The prefects, therefore the State, and not the commissioners, decide on the deployment of forces. They take their orders from the Ministry of the Interior, which takes them from Elys√©e.",France,/r/europe/comments/agx4gj/france_police_violence_we_are_at_the_state_lie/ee9mtdu/,Ayasta,1547726984

2022,"&gt;Responding massively to the demonstrations of ""yellow vests"" is therefore a political choice. The state uses police officers who are not trained in policing: the BAC[anti-crime brigade], the BRI[research and intervention brigades], peacekeepers... They are used to dealing with offenders, not demonstrators. For them, the crowd is delinquent. This is a key point in understanding the 100 or so serious injuries.

&gt;**How did doctrine evolve with the ""yellow vest"" crisis?**

&gt;I note that the police are increasingly targeting journalists, preventing voluntary rescue workers from acting, and willingly breaking mobile phones of people filming, as if in a desire to prevent any documentation of events.

&gt;It is a doctrine that goes towards confrontation, and therefore extremely dangerous. It will leave its mark on a whole generation. All those who are demonstrating today will remember this terrifying police crackdown.

&gt;The use of untrained police officers, the use of dangerous weapons, tension and fatigue in law enforcement, martial arts discourses of politics and Castaner's denial of what is happening - it is an explosive cocktail. We have completely changed scale: the number of arrests, police custody, shootings, mobilized police officers...

&gt;The way out will be through politics, not repression, that's obvious. Every Saturday, people go on a demonstration knowing that they may lose an eye. Everything is done to dissuade them from coming, yet they still come.

2072,"What you describe is indeed a genetic algorithm. But to my knowledge this is not really done right now. I stress that every specific algorithm I mentioned is an example of very general ML techniques. Linear Models, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Deep Learning, genetic algorithms are all different models and can be applied to supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning to some degree. But they are not the same!

You do not train a linear model using genetic algorithms, also a deep learning algorithm is not trained that way, a image classifier is not trained that way, an autonomous car is not trained that way (in the general case). An rather simple explanation is that the runtime is just not ideal. It takes a huge amount of memory and CPU-power to apply genetic algorithms. Neural networks are trained using gradient descent (in the general case), which also take a huge amount of memory and CPU-power but outperform genetic algorithms today by a huge margin.

I do not want to come across as stern or bossy, but you seem to lack a lot of knowledge about the current state of ML and thus AI. *The Elements of Statistical Learning* or the courses from Andrew Ng (or his book *Machine Learning Yearning*) are great introductions into the field. Also check out Kaggle where you can find a lot of interesting problems and also solutions from others. The [AlphaGo paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/alphago/AlphaGoNaturePaper.pdf) is also very interesting. You might find this insightful.

This is in hilly conditions where connectivity is difficult. In flat terrain you are talking 30 to 40 km range and it is much easier.

Unfortunately, the situation is being contained, mostly by silence from the media... You'll see the subject being talked about many times a day, but you'll not see what we see on the streets.

&amp;#x200B;

The people are fighting against authorities protecting the elite. I've been to a protest (12th Jan.), to take a look at the situation (to clarify, I'm not a Yellow Vest, but I am a citizen, one of us). Here are a few things I have seen, moreover not even in Paris, the capital, but in another major city.

&amp;#x200B;

* The people (that's us), literally put to tears by the police's weaponry. One might say ""yeah dumbass, it's tear gas""; but the fact remains that when you have the population, waves of people in tears and pain in front of you, you realize a thing or two.
* Anti-riot teams regularly slapping people's phones violently as they are filming (rightfully so), either breaking them on the ground or sending them away in the masses.
* Anti-riot teams using excessive violence consistently, and I'm not talking about violent inobedient protestors throwing bottles, I'm talking people without Yellow Vests filming on their phone, or just standing there. I've seen first hand a standard (5 or 6 men) team breaking a young man's knee, legit breaking it with an audible sound, because he was filming within 5 meters (it's not uncommon, you always have a few cameras out). I guess the police man was getting tired, and the rest had to show unity? The fact is, he will never have to take responsibility for his violent, unwarranted aggression.
* Out of uniform teams (that's not uncommon in France), wearing only an armband and dressed like any other thug, charging individuals, beating them up, then moving on, leaving those individuals on the ground, wounded. (Remember, it is January, the ground is wet from the water cannon truck that hosed down the people a few minutes ago)
* Water cannon truck, although another respectable anti-riot weapon, used profusely and on obviously undeserving masses. Arguable, of course, as you can't verify if those people did deserve it or not, and that's why they can do it. I'm sure some do deserve it in fact... The problem I have is seeing an old man with his back turned to the truck getting pushed to the ground by a very powerful and probably cold water cannon in January... It wasn't pleasant to see, and I'll remember it my whole life.
* What we call ""voltigeurs"", teams of 2 on bikes, armed with tonfas and flashball guns, hitting people at speed before disappearing around the corner. I'm sure you can imagine how this isn't ok.

The situation is worse than what is let to transpire through mainstream media. What is happening is a battle between the people, and the authorities that should be protecting us from our enemies. We should feel safe behind them, but we are forcibly being put on our knees by them, to protect those in power. It's no joke. It's fucked up, really fucked up.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the problem is, the masses are stupid as hell. They have no clue how to handle the situation, and so are being very easily controlled by the forces. The opposing side, that is the governing elite and the police, have extensive strategic and tactical knowledge, and much more equipment and stuff...

&gt;If the spouses got married **in Germany**, they had the possibility to determine their name usage in the marriage in front of the registrar‚Äôs officer. This is then stated in the marriage certificate.

This may work.

If not:

&gt;If the spouses got married **outside of Germany**, they may not have had the possibility to determine their last names when they got married because foreign provisions do not have comparable regulations. This is the case in most US states. The result is that the name of the German spouse has not changed in Germany and he or she still bears the same name as before the marriage ‚Äì even if the German spouse has already been using the other spouse‚Äôs name in everyday life.
&gt;
&gt;However, the German law governing use of names offers spouses the possibility to retroactively give a name declaration in order to receive the desired last name in the marriage. This name declaration can be done anytime as long as the marriage exists and is irrevocable.
&gt;
&gt;According to Section 1355 (2) of the German Civil Code, spouses can opt for the birth name of one of the spouses or the name one of the spouses had at the time of the name declaration to become a so-called married name (‚ÄúEhename‚Äù). The spouse whose name does not become the married name can add his or her previous name or birth name with a hyphen in front or behind the married name according to Section 1355 (4) of the German Civil Code.

So you may be able to get married in Italy or wherever, then get your German citizenship, then make the retroactive change.

I would check with a expert, since I don't know how not being a citizen at the time ties in and and what makes one ""get married in a location"" (residence?  Just doing the legal registration?).

In every survey at the moment, a second referendum is the most popular option. But MPs don't have the guts to do it because it's viewed by some as undemocratic. 

Most of my friends are hoping this all becomes too difficult, we give up and stay in the EU. I didn't think that was possible but now I'm not so sure. May and Corbyn have both said no deal isn't an option. No deal is what most leavers want. If no deal seriously isn't an option, then remain must be an option. No one is going to agree to a deal. It's one way or the other. Parliament is more likely to ask to extend article 50 or revoke it than crash out with no deal. Leavers will hate it and I don't blame them, but parliament decides and parliament doesn't want no deal.

Some of my friends want to crash out with no deal. They're so fed up of the whole thing, they've decided just to let leavers have their way and experience the reality of life outside the EU. We'll rejoin in 10 years once all the old buggers who voted for this are dead and a new generation of voters comes along. We'll lose our current benefits by doing that though.

It is madness. Not meaning mental illness but the state of utmost courage. Courage itself is akin to madness as they are both describing ability to act in face of fear and so they are hard to tell apart.

2706,"&gt; This comports largely with what my wife's grandfather (B17 bombardier, Bloody 100th) had told me. He was given a primary target which was always military our industrial, and a secondary of the same. 

I don't think the records area easily available to break down which groups attacked which targets, but the 8th certainly did carry out area attacks where the primary or secondary objective was specified as a German city. That's not to say your wife's grandfather was wrong, there were a lot of different groups and a lot of different targets, and after a certain date the 8th began changing ""city area"" to ""marshalling yard"" in the official records (even though they carried on using incendiaries, which aren't suitable for marshalling yards).

&gt;I think that's an order of magnitude of in difference from British night raids.

There was a difference in scale and focus, but not in methods. The 8th AF area bombed Germany alongside the RAF. They did so just as deliberately. 

&gt;I also believe they did not have the range to return to England from Berlin with a full load of bombs.

Missions were usually planned with a certain fuel allowance that took in to account bombs would be dropped at the target. Bringing them back would cut in to the reserves allowed, so I don't think many crews would bring their bombs back, no matter how far away the target was. 

I know the RAF had a policy banning their crews from jettisoning their bombs over land at the start of the war. They changed that about 2 weeks after the Blitz on London started. 

But air forces also knew that dropping a bomb on something was better than bringing it back. Overy says that notes found on German bomber pilots even before the Blitz began highlight that jettisoning bombs over London was permitted because ""something of value"" would be hit. General Twining, head of the 15th AF operating out of Italy, instructed his crews: 

&gt;Any military installation, communication line, or industrial plant,
no matter how small, adds to the German war strength, and almost
any one of the numerous GERMAN towns contains such a target.
Bombardment crews may select such targets as alternate targets of
opportunity in the event that primary targets or assigned alternate
targets cannot be bombed. **It is imperative that every bomb carried
into GERMANY be dropped to achieve maximum results. Under no
circumstances will bombs be returned to bases after being carried
over German territory.**

The Luftwaffe developed area bombing techniques over the UK in 1940. The RAF copied them and the USAAF copied the RAF. It's a mistake to think any of the air forces avoided area attacks. They all saw them as a very useful way of damaging the enemy.",,/r/europe/comments/agj54j/today_74_years_ago_on_16january1945_magdeburg/ee86nk1/,WhiteSatanicMills,1547676594

2779,"&gt; Sounds like you used a wrong model? What kind of model was it? 

Again, no model was used. It was a pure application of a machine learning algorithm which was based on the idea that similar input should generally result in similar output.

I think we're talking about entirely different things when we say model. Do you mean with model the model of the world you use as input and output? Or do you mean the stuff between those 2. Or do you mean different forms of machine learning algorithms?

When i say model, i mean whatever is in between the input and the output. The thing that we try to create in the first place by using AI. The neural network for example.

&gt; Genetic algorithms and NNs are not the same!

I mentioned those 2 at the same time, because they are basically always used at the same time. If somebody talks neural networks its nearly universally true that genetic algorithms are used. If you don't use genetic algorithms combined with neural networks, we would generally call it a graph or a tree. I should have added a ""with"" to make it clearer.

&gt; Did you determine the thresholds using all the data? 

All the training data. And then i let it lose on the ""unknown"" data without feeding those results back in. You can call it a very simple statistical analysis, though that would give far too much credibility to it really. And yes a NN could achieve this down the line. 

Which is kinda the point. I came up with truly simple idea that would take a NN way longer, if it ever learns it at all. The issue is, when do you stop training? When the money runs out? When the training data runs out? (if it isn't generated that is) If you use genetic algorithms to evolve Neural Networks, you can never be sure that you aren't just in a local peak instead of the global peak. 

&gt; I know models which are based on xgboost. 

I took a look at it, and from the short information i gathered i'm not entirely sure how to classify it. Mostly because it doesn't ""add"" anything to the model you create. Absolutely part of machine learning and it looks like a great way to improve the speed of learning by focusing on the ""not well learned issues"", but dunno...",Germany,/r/europe/comments/agkakq/have_your_say_european_expert_group_seeks/ee87vir/,Alcobob,1547677366

2785,"&gt; Nutella is sold as the product. They literally talk on their website about just ""Nutella"", not ""Nutella Version X or Y"". The shops list this stuff as Nutella, nothing else. Sometime Nutella chocolate spread. On the packaging it only says Nutella, nothing else.

That is the power of marketing... They don't even need to include the product anymore. Just like you know what I mean when I say 'heineken' or 'facebook': the name has become so associated with the product that it is no longer necessary to name the product. [Even wikipedia calls it a *brand*.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutella) It is like shoes: It will just say nike or adidas, but that is just the brand, not the product.

&gt;So if Apple puts in the small print: this iPhone X actually has a resolution half of the ones sold a few hundred kilometers that way, you think that is fine?

They don't need to say it has a ""resolution half of the ones sold a few hundred kilometers that way"". They just need to declare what the resolution is. The fact that that differs between regions is rather irrelevant to the performance of this model.

Also, again: just generic iPhone is closer to the comparison with nutella, as nutella is a brand, just like iPhone is.

Ingredients are also not exactly fine print, hidden away.

&gt;Let's be honest here, nobody is reading the ingredient list or knows what it all means.

So who's fault is it then if they buy it? Would you fault HP if someone bought an HP Omen without checking the model?

You should try reading the ingredient declaration btw. I find it amusing to see what shit they try to peddle now, and the fact that people buy it. You'll quickly learn that what they sell in stores is just crap.

&gt;And even if they do, they don't have a choice in it, because the product of the quality they want is not for sale there.

So they buy something they don't want...?

&gt;With regulations to manage the goods sold in it, so they follow the same standards.

And if they breach those standards, the action is naturally required. But unless you are talking about baby foods, there actually isn't much in the form of food standards other than those necessary from the viewpoint of public health.

&gt;And with rules about product names, so someone can not sell champagne if it is not from Champagne.

Yes... But *this* is a completely unrelated issue... This is about the idea that certain products have inherent characteristics which make them what they are, and if they don't have those qualities they can't be that product, and thus you are lying to the consumer if you sell it as such. But this is about generic products, not individual brands... It is like how in Italy nutella cannot be sold as chocolate cream as it does not contain enough chocolate to qualify as such. But you cannot tell private companies what they must put in their private brands, and how they must use them. That is insane...

&gt;If you can print Coca-Cola Zero on a packaging you can also print Coca-Cola Bavarian Taste on it and if people think that is better they buy it. But don't go around selling the same product with different stuff in it under the same name.

But they are relying on the strength of the brand to sell their product... Why would they want to diminish the strength of their brand for this purpose?

&gt;But please don't come with arguments that people should just read the ingredient list, especially since they can't even compare it to the other product since it is not sold there.

I am sorry, but the fact that different ingredients are used elsewhere does not change the product you are buying. It has no bearing whatsoever on what you are doing at that moment. And if you can't be bothered to look at what you are buying, which really isn't difficult, then what are you complaining about?

 ( also you comment dislike ratio so far seems ok for a political debate)

The reason brexit could not have worked as a lot to do with the picture that was painted of it ( aswell as the solutions of it). Though lieing has been done by both sides) . 

1. Imagration 50+% of it has nothing to do with the EU. Even the EU one you can do a lot more about while in it. So that brexit argument seems weird since really just requires goverment/parlamentet action. 

2. Trade agreements could it be better than your current ones with the EU and other trade deals EU made with others. Japan recently for example.
 
Uk has a weaker hand aswell as both Trumps America and China wont give you a fair one deal. (Thats 50% of the worlds economy there)
 Then EU with another 25% ( most important one since its the closest one). 

3. The independence part. 
Laws are always affected by others and no leader eules alone and without allies. Especally in a world more dominated by powers. 

European nations wont be able to stand alone since we are pretty small ones incomperison to others and their nations growth potential. So better to make up a part of one so you cant be to abused. 

 Laws
Especally manufactures and agriculture most likely wont want diffrent ones becuse of making standards makes it very expensive adaptation to make. EU, China and USA is worth it but smaller ones? Depends.  most will simply follow EU ones so they can sell there aswell if they overproduce ( closest one)

If you have such a model, then it's a human made model, because AI is messy. Seriously messy. I'll give you a very simple example for a very low level AI based on a genetic algorithm. Mar I/O, an AI for playing Super Mario:

Now, let's come back to unknown problems. With just 1 change this AI will fail miserably and would basically have to relearn everything. Simply mirror the level. All the training data is useless unless a human manually reverses the inputs and outputs correctly.

&gt;Sounds cool, but how did you come up with the thresholds? Was it statistics or biological knowledge? 

Actually it was as i described: I took the training data, searched for the maximum of each value that still had an occurrence as a true negative and overruled ALL of the AI decisions in case it was above and called it positive.

2908,"Since the proposed successor do LHC, the Future Circular Collider, lead to some news here in the sub, I decided to present you [ELI](https://eli-laser.eu/), Extreme Light Infrastructure. That's also a pan-European research project for investigation in LASER physics. The project, funded by the EU and initiated by G√©rard Mourou, one of last year's Nobel laureates, aims to increase the focus on Laser physics research and give Europe a foothold in the development of new technologies and tecniques in the area. When in full swing, the ELI project will be divided in four pillars:
* [ELI-ALPS](https://www.eli-alps.hu/), based in Szeged, Hungary, will focus on ultrafast lasers (Attosecond Light Pulse Source).
* [ELI-NP](http://www.eli-np.ro/), based in MƒÉgurele, Romania, will use laser to focus on Nuclear Physics (photonuclear physics) and the creation of intensive fields.
* [ELI-BL](https://www.eli-beams.eu/en/), based in Doln√≠ B≈ôe≈æany, Czech Republic, will host the world's powerful laser and will use it for high energy research (BL stands for beamlines).
* Once these three are up and running, they will pave the work for a fourth pilar, focusing in ultra-high-intensity lasers, in a city yet to be determined.

2914,"Romanians are generally very pro-EU, at least 1 in 3 Romanians work abroad in the EU and that‚Äôs only official figures. As you can imagine, for this people and also for their families, Romania falling out with EU would be a complete nightmare. 

Now, the problem with Romanians is that they are so disgruntled with politics they don‚Äôt even vote. The current coalition, which is almost openly pro-corruption won with around 3.6 million votes, out of 18 million eligible voters. The problem is that out of those 18 million, only around 7 million valid votes were actually cast, so you basically have 11 million Romanians who aren‚Äôt even represented in parliament. 

Now, almost every Romanian party that is currently in parliament has at least a couple of prominent figures who are or were currently jailed, but the two ruling parties (PSD and ALDE) are the worst offenders by a long shot. How they managed to get so many votes is a technique I like to call collective bribing. The majority of their voter base is pensioners, minimum wage employees, people living off welfare and public employees, in other words people who‚Äôs income depends directly on government policies. Just to get an idea:

- In 2016 the minimum wage was ‚Ç¨267 per month. Currently, it‚Äôs ‚Ç¨443 per month

- In 2016 the average doctor working in a state hospital made around ‚Ç¨1000 per month, now they‚Äôre making over ‚Ç¨3000

Other state sanctioned incomes have risen as well. This is obviously done at the expense of people working in the private sector and private companies as well, or at least, those who work for more than minimum wage. 

People who actually pay the taxes for this collective bribing practiced by the PSD are obviously not happy, but the problem is that Romania also has a very small number of actual taxpayers. If you count all the employees, self employed, freelancers, business owners and so on, there‚Äôs probably 4 million people at the very best. These 4 million people basically have to foot the bills for 6.5 million people on welfare, 5.2 million pensioners and 1.2 million public employees, it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous.

Furthermore ending freedom movement would put the civil lives of millions of people at jeopardy. And why should let's say Italy accept British people while the UK does not have to do the same the other way around? Either freedom of movement has to remain intact everywhere, or we end it every everywhere, but that would have even more severe consequences for a much larger population.

3095,"&gt;Impressive essay, but we‚Äòre fundamentally talking about a thought experiment on moral, not operational merit.

There's a huge moral difference in killing people working for the enemy and killing people under your control.

Another counter example would be a soldier who held a position killing 100 attacking enemy soldiers in the process would be recommended for a medal. A soldier who shot dead 100 prisoners would be guilty of a war crime. 

What's the difference between a German soldier and a German soldier who has surrendered? One is an enemy and killing him is permissible, the other is a prisoner, no threat, and therefore killing him is forbidden.

&gt;I can easily alter it though and make the operation a commando strike: The SAS randomly drops into German cities, kills civilians and leaves notes telling the people their child may be next should their leadership persist resisting.

It's still not a valid comparison because a soldier on the ground has much more discrimination over his targets than a bomb aimer in the air. If the SAS parachuted into a German city and placed bombs on a dam that supplied water and hydroelectricity, and the resultant flood destroyed a large part of the town, that would still be a legitimate target.

&gt;Complete Allied air superiority enables these actions.

It didn't enable the accuracy necessary to attack precise targets. 

Let me give you a couple of example. The United States Strategic Bombing Survey (the postwar investigation into bombing) gives statistics for raids on 3 large German oil refinery complexes. Each averaged 1 square mile. The RAF and 8th AF between them dropped tens of thousands of bombs on the plants (and contrary to general belief, the RAF actually dropped more tons on oil targets than the 8th AF). Of those tens of thousands of bombs, on 3 very large targets, 15.8% of the RAF bombs fell within the plant boundaries, and 12.6% of the combined RAF and 8th AF tonnage (ie the 8th AF was somewhere below 12.6%).

That sort of accuracy doesn't permit ""precision"" targeting. To do so is wasteful and doesn't even protect the lives of civilians anyway.

The first Luftwaffe attack on London on 15th August 1940 was a ""precision"" attack on Kenley airfield by low level bombers of a specialist unit. They actually bombed Croydon airport a few miles away, and many of the bombs hit a soap factory in Croydon, killing 60 civilians. In 1942 the RAF attacked the Renault factory in Billancourt near Paris. They bombers went in at low level to try to avoid collateral damage to the town (because it was in France, not Germany). They hit the factory and caused extensive damage, but many of the bombs also overshot the factory and hit the town, killing 370 French civilians. That was more civilian casualties than the RAF had inflicted in a single raid on Germany, even though they were trying to hit German towns.

Precision bombing in WW2 was a myth. ",,/r/europe/comments/agj54j/today_74_years_ago_on_16january1945_magdeburg/ee79wbc/,WhiteSatanicMills,1547655631

&gt;Copyright trolling

This has nothing to do with the copyright proposals. Takedown requests are already a feature of EU law and have been for many years. All content hosts already abide by these rules and they are not changing.

&gt;It cant tell a difference between parody/news reporting/etc

This is one of the few legitimate criticisms that have been made. But I would note that YouTube is full of parodies and news reports, which would strongly suggest that there won't be significant problems.

&gt;Used for censorship

This is the same as copyright trolling.

&gt;i had to appeal every single of my youtube gameplay videos because youtube would mark it as not advertisers friendly

I'm not entirely sure what ""not advertisers friendly"" means but it doesn't sound like it has anything to do with copyright or the EU's proposals. Could you explain more?

&gt;Good luck making billions of license agreements. Small artists are going to get ignored

Making a license agreement is not hard. It sounds very much like you have one of your own with Google. The proposals very explicitly require content hosts to make such agreements and there is no lower limit on the size of the rightsholder.

You are right that content creators tend to organise themselves into larger groups. That's a more effective way of enforcing your rights. Just ask your nearest union!

&gt;it doesnt really help small content creators with anything, they already have all the rights since article 13 dont expand on those

It does expand them, which you clearly know because you moaned about it in your previous point. It compels content hosts to negotiate with everyone no matter how small. This is arguably the whole point of the exercise.

The big companies can already pressure them into action, which is why Content ID (and your advertising revenue...) already exist today.

&gt;You honestly believe that there will be filters offered by other companies that are even close to what youtube offer?

I doubt it very much, because the proposals don't require anything remotely that complicated. YouTube is trying to do much more with Content ID than the proposals ask them to.

&gt;Sites with already established filters will have a huge edge over those that dont

This is why the capabilities of content hosts are accounted for, including both their size *and* their earnings. If you can't reasonable take action, no action is required. There isn't even a strict requirement to implement content matching if you can get things done by hand.

&gt;There is NOTHING good about article 13, unless you are a big corporation holding a lot of copyrights, otherwise you already could defend your copyright without bigger effort.

As I've shown several times, the big corps benefit surprisingly little from these rules because they can already threaten content hosts in court. Hence the content of their letter.

3148,"Communism was never popular in Poland before and after the war. If Poland would have chance to organise free and democratic country (like Germans) center-left (socialists and agrarians) would win majority of votes without a doubt. 

There was a referendum in Poland just after the war. It was a short period when communist policies were quite liberal, and some independent organisation were allowed to function. There were three questions in referendum, which were quite neutral, if asked in normal circumstances would probably won majority of votes. They were as follows:

1. Are you in favour of abolishing the Senate?

2. Do you want consolidation, in the future constitution of the economic system founded on agricultural reform and the nationalisation of basic national industries, including the preservation of the statutory rights of private enterprise?

3. Do you want consolidation of the western border of the Polish State on the Baltic, Oder river and Lusatian Neisse?

Nothing particualry controversial. There is no mention of communist or totalitarian regime. Agricultural reform was for a long time one of the most popular projects in Poland. Nobody cared about Senat. New border was not also anything controversial, especially since there was no mention about giving up Eastern territories. Nonetheless real results were quite disappointing for new rulers, 73% was voting against abolishing Senat which was clearly manifestation of opposition to new rulers (especially since they were calling to voting ""[3xYes](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/3xtak.jpg)"").

Of course there were Polish people who were supporting communists with conviction. Also after sometime when it was clear that PRL is the only Poland we could possibly have and there is no real alternative, people get used to it. Famous Polish writer Maria DƒÖbrowska even said that ""You cannot turn away from Poland"". Especially since after Stalinism regime became less oppresive. Nonetheless in my opinion if Russians would suddenly back out from Poland and declare they would no longer support Polish communists, regime would not stand day longer.

The story was quickly swept under the rug by the secret police, the Securitate, because all the country needed to start a revolution was an incident like this, but the people of Brasov have kept his memory alive. He was 47 and sacrificed himself in order to send a message.

&amp;#x200B;

8 months later, on December 16th 1989, the Romanian Revolution started when local authorities tried to evacuate Hungarian pastor Tokes Laszlo from his home and relocate him to the countryside. Initially, his congregation started protesting against this specific thing, but quickly it turned into ""down with the dictator"", ""death to Ceausescu"", ""no more hunger"" and ethnic Romanians joined in. That was it, the sparkle that helped ignite the country. The army took over the city of Timisoara the next day, killed tens of peaceful protesters and dumped their bodies in a sewer...only thing is, story managed to circulate throughout the country, and a few days later, while Ceausescu tried to hold a speech in Bucharest condemning the Timisoara ""hooligans"", this happened: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xntDto5TX10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xntDto5TX10).

You would also have to believe that the EU would negotiate in bad faith to keep the UK locked, when in reality, they would down the line be able to get a CETA agreement. That tradedeal took over 10 years. 

Meanwhile the UK and Ireland, NI and political parties have an international agreement on the border of NI and Ireland. 

Either the UK breaks that agreement or they follow EU rules until it is sorted. 


&gt;During the negotiations on Britain's planned 2019 withdrawal from the European Union, the EU produced a position paper on its concerns regarding support of the Good Friday Agreement by the UK during Brexit. The position paper addresses topics including the avoidance of a hard border, the North-South cooperation between Ireland and Northern Ireland, the birthright of all of the people of Northern Ireland (as set out in the Agreement), and the Common Travel Area. Anyone born in Northern Ireland, and thus entitled to an Irish passport by the Good Friday Agreement, will also be able to retain EU citizenship after Brexit. Under the European Union negotiating directives for Brexit, the UK was asked to satisfy the other EU members that these topics had been addressed in order to progress to the second stage of Brexit negotiations. In order to protect North-South co-operation and avoid controls on the Irish border, the UK agreed to protect the Agreement in all its parts and ""in the absence of agreed solutions, the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement.

&gt;She would have had to have believed that her deal would appease brexiters. That those voting to leave the eu would accept the backstop. A potential situation where the uk is bound by eu rules without any say in them. And no way to leave that prison (no article 50 etc to escape the backstop). 

Brexiters would never be satisfied, as they want different things. The only thing unifying them, is leaving the political institutions. 

The UK still wants access to the internal market, they want a free flow of goods and services, but the pick and choose of the different pillars of the EU was never on the table.

In addition the nobility in Europe was very connected. It was very possible that the Duke of $HRE-Region also was the count of $French-Region and the uncle of the English King.

First of all the saw themself as Christian. After that they where a member of the local community which most of the time was smaller than 30 people. And if they really had seen the world, they once visite a city with 2 or 3 thousand citizens.

In 1400 there where ~9.5 million people living in that giant HRE. And only 3 million in England. The largest city of the HRE was Prague with 70.000 people. (Rome had 35.000 back then, down from over a million during the Roman Empire) and it took you weeks and month to travel through Europe.

3320,"&gt;Yes. By food producers. They deliberately make products of a lesser quality, put them in the same packaging, and sell for the same price (or higher) as in the west. You have to compare ingredient lists on packages from different countries to notice it. It is done deliberately.

I'm sure they do that, but I'm also sure that producers can and do downgrade quantity and/or quality of their products sold under the same brand, gradually over time, in Western Europe. So they do it in time and space. It's just the eternal battle of buyers and sellers trying to get the best possible deal for themselves.

&gt;The problem is not new yet it is ignored by the western countries. Yet if the eastern countries went on and banned those products, would you not cry ""free movement of goods"" in a heartbeat?

Among other things. If a hard Brexit occurs, how many people do you think are going to wake up with the looming prospect of losing their job? How many people are going to be adversely impacted by the economic crisis that will occur? Are you prepared to suffer for 10-15 years while the UK tries to sort their shit?
 

&gt; ""Taking back sovereignty of your own country""

This is a massive load of horseshit. The UK has always had a seat at the table to influence and decide on policy regulation within the EU. The UK is a **representative democracy** - a key distinction in that the public elects representatives who work on their behalf. And the MPs have worked to incorporate EU input *at the request of the people insofar as it aligned with the general interests of bettering public interest.* The ""taking back sovereignty"" argument is bullshit propaganda based on conflicting views of what it even means. The fact that Article 50 even exists to begin with is the tacit acknowledgement that at any point a member state is free to walk away - but conversely acknowledges that participation is an acceptance and acknowledgement of the validity of EU input. The idea that the UK doesn't have sovereignty is bullshit - and Brexit means that the UK doesn't get to influence or direct policy decisions in the EU which will ultimately get forced on anyway as part of whatever deal needs to be cut to maintain access to the single market and/or custom union.

&gt; Its called a democracy, unfortunately for people like you, people who don't agree with you get a say too. ***And we think you're stupid too.***

Again, representative democracy. Not the same thing - but please continue to declare how stupid **we** are for being able to defer to expert opinion and see how fucking stupid the decision to leave is. Do you feel that the Leave camp have been able to fulfill their campaign promises? Do you see a favorable deal like the one that was promised? You can think the people who wish to Remain are stupid but this commitment to your own ignorance is on full display. The best deal the EU will offer just got rejected. They will not give a better one. And if you think it's just going to be reduced growth for the economy but ""sovereignty is worth it"" without having an idea of what that entails or the cost of the folly, then you're going to be in for a very rough time.

That's some might big horseshit. The fact Brexit is even possible at all shows that the UK's participation in the EU was democratic. The British people have always elected repreentatives to enact law on their behalf during their membership in the EU - where they got a voice and a seat at the table to represent the British people. And with the agreement to join the EU was the tacit agreement that EU input on regulations was welcome.

The Referendum was advisory and the Leave campaign ran on misinformation: half-truths if not outright lies. If the people vote based on a misrepresentation of what the decision's consequences will be then how can the result be considered truly valid? Now that multiple studies have come out predicting Brexit being incredibly bad for the UK, it's ignorant to be willing to put the entire country through the possibility of economic collapse.

I'd guess that with political bets and other speculative prop bets, they just rely on the authoritative voices that are informing most of the betting public.

The countries outraged over the practice are typically the hardest opponents of any centralization and yielding of powers to Brussels.

Well, they are getting to short end of the stick here because of that, because there's no regulation mandating companies to sell identical products for identical prices through the EU.

Nor should there be, for a Scandinavian would hastily pour down the soda on the drain a Cypriot considers perfectly normal due to the different preferences in sweetness.

This opens up the possibility of market positioning. Poles and Romanians can't buy Nutella (or any other product of scrutiny) with the same frequency and consider it as much of an everyday breakfast food as French and German people can. For the former, they are treats for rarer occasions  by a lot of people and are only bought with similar to the Frenchmen's frequency by upper-middle class people who aren't so sensitive to price. 

Therefore the company can't hope to move comparable volumes relative to the population size they can in West Europe, which both drives up the unit price for trivial ""real"" reasons and also incentivizes the company to increase their profit rate on what they are able to get into the Eastern shopping baskets.

3657,"There are a lot of reasons. One, that there is a big difference in opinion between the peoples opinion on the street of the EU in 2016 and the opinion of members of parliament in 2018.

Then, the British people got kinda played. I'm sorry to say that, but the big proponents of Brexit are amateurs. Have you seen how they acted? They did nearly everything wrong they could, and so mare sure that Britain would get the worse outcome.

If I was not of the opinion that they were so incredible over their head and overwhelmed by the task they set out to do, I would argue they have done it purposely.

An example: At 2016, the EU was disunited, and down in moral. Brexit just happened, Trump was president, the refugee crisis, huge amounts of fighting words between Germany and Poland, oh it didn't looked good for the Union.

And here come our heroes. They start by antagonising EU in ridiculous levels, making threads that EU citizens could be used as ""bargaining chips"" (the polish loved that!) and said very often, and very loudly, that they just had to break up the Union, and then its gonna be easy pickings.

You know, when your not an Englishmen, you could get the impression that the British don't have your interests in mind. It sounds like you would get fed to the wolfs by them, if it helped them.

But the biggest mistake, in my opinion, was that they totally ignored and failed the European political meta.
David Davis didn't went to Brussels, or Paris, or Warsaw for his first ""negotiations"", he went to Berlin.
With that single action, he fucked it all up.
Why?

Because the legend of german domination of the Europe, is one with a history. One of the cornerstones of the EU is that it gives a way to integrate Germany without them selling out their interests while they don't dominate the rest. That's why the EU has so many rules, is so slow in making decisions. Its so the behemoth at its core doesn't run wilde.

And you just showed everyone in Europe, that you don't give a shit about them, you went straight to Berlin, to ask the big boy how the deal is gonna be, cause fuck the rest, they'll gonna follow, right?

The message is basicly ""Hey, we want that the Union breaks up, and then we are gonna work with the Germans as our favourites.""

That message was what fucked any chance of the other countries breaking out. Poland stopped its aggressive rhetoric nearly over night. (As there are still parts of german society that have ""interesting"" opinions towards the border. These are also no fans of the EU).

And then, Berlin send the Brits back packing, laying it into the hands of a Frenchmen with a little bit disturbing love for spreadsheets. If that wasn't a good will, then I don't know.

At the same time for the UK not getting that deal is best responded with rejection of this one and doing negotiations after. This means that essentially the UK has more to gain to hold off on negotiations later than attempting to renegotiate a bad deal instead.

This statement is pretty dubious at face value.

If something is customary (and for some reason only for plant protection products) that does not mean their procedures are beyond reproach. Certainly not for an organization accused of being too cozy with industry insiders over the same issue in the past.  It's not customary in any actual scientific papers submitted for peer review, I'm not sure why it should be for an organization responsible for reviewing those papers.  So, according to them it's not 'plagiarism', it's 'integration',  without attribution. It's customary, and totally cool. Also, I understand that not all of the industry material included in the report was even published, or peer reviewed, but rest assured, officials at the BfR reviewed it and found the 'up to standard'--whatever that means. Also left unsaid is their process for deciding which studies to integrate in their report.

3847,"&gt;The reasonable deal is staying in the customs union

Absolutely nothing reasonable about having our external tariffs being dictated to us by the EU.

&gt;and allow immigration.

Why are you guys so obsessed with being allowed to move here. It borders on unhealthy. You have 26 other countries to choose from, just let us go!

&gt;EU immigrants contribute on average 2300¬£ a year more than average UK citizens. There are 3.8 million EU immigrants, let's say only 2 million (probably way more) are ready for work. This is already 4.6 billion which puts the net loss to 2.4 billion. However the 4.6 billion is excluding the actual contributions cause it's just on average how much more a migrant worker contribute over a standard Brit. So this would make the net loss a net profit already.

We don't need FoM to take your migrants. We can simply let them in, unless you prevent them leaving like North Korea. Outside the EU we would also be able to charge a premium to incoming migrants.

&gt;Now think about how much it's gonna cost to leave the customs union. Every vehicle has to be checked going in and out which costs time and time is money. Currently it's all pretty quick but that will change with brexit. The amount of money lost is going to be huge.

Better to have checks than have our tariffs chosen by the EU. Better to be able to charge import duty on the massive trade surplus the EU has with the UK, although I appreciate that consumers will take a hit, but taxes can be reduced in other areas to compensate ",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/agccv4/british_house_of_commons_votes_against_theresa/ee5ris7/,HawkUK,1547597840

3859,"&gt;European Central Bank President Mario Draghi warned Tuesday that the eurozone economy has weakened unexpectedly amid rising headwinds originating outside the currency union, including an economic slowdown in China.  
&gt;  
&gt;The comments reflect rising concerns among ECB officials that Europe‚Äôs six-year economic recovery could be undermined by a string of threats beyond its borders, from Brexit to tensions over international trade.  
&gt;  
&gt;Europe‚Äôs economic slowdown, underlined earlier Tuesday by weak German growth figures for 2018, comes at an awkward time for the ECB: The central bank moved only last month to phase out a key stimulus tool, its ‚Ç¨2.5 trillion ($2.85 trillion) bond-buying program, in a first step toward higher interest rates.  
&gt;  
&gt;It could impact the ECB‚Äôs next policy steps, including a keenly awaited move to raise short-term interest rates for the first time since 2011. The ECB‚Äôs key policy rate is currently set at minus 0.4%, and policy makers have pledged to keep rates at that level at least though the summer.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been receiving weaker data than expected now for a longer time than we had expected a few months ago,‚Äù Mr. Draghi told lawmakers in a speech at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThere is no room for complacency,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA significant amount of monetary-policy stimulus is still needed to support the further buildup of domestic price pressures and headline inflation.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;For now, policy makers don‚Äôt expect the bloc to tumble into recession, Mr. Draghi said. He argued that the region‚Äôs domestic economy remained strong and that the slowdown partly reflected temporary factors that would fade, such as bottlenecks in Germany‚Äôs auto industry.  
&gt;  
&gt;Still, the ECB chief warned that recent international developments had put into question the pillars that have underpinned the global economy since the World War II. These include challenges to the European Union, Brexit, U.S. trade tensions with China and ‚Äúthe denial of the multilateral system,‚Äù Mr. Draghi said.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúWe notice that some of these things get better, some get worse,‚Äù Mr. Draghi said. Currently, the uncertainty is hurting business and consumer confidence, and the ECB is therefore monitoring the situation closely, he said.

Article 50 is quite clear about that : 2 years. Extension if the countries all agree. Which is not the case because the EU is tired of UK asking for more. This is, as I said multiple time in this thread, a waste of time. And we can even add a waste of money. This shitshow has been for 2 and a half years. I think there is 100% chance EU would deny that. 

The EU has been clear (and ready) since the start of the negotiation. It doesn't have to be a victim of UK because they are unable to negotiate. The deal we proposed to UK was the one to be choosen.

3903,"We allowed an urban planning phenomenon known as 'ribbon planning' for too long. It's something that naturally popped upped due to cars becoming widespread but it's a horribly inefficent use of resources.

You can google it for more information, but I found this segment from the Dutch Wikipedia pretty good, I translated it with DeepL because I'm lazy.

&gt; Almost all Belgian villages have ribbon development. This is a consequence of the fact that until recently, spatial planning was hardly ever controlled by the government. This building phenomenon, which mainly occurs in densely populated Flanders, continued strongly during the course of the twentieth century. This also happened because of legal provisions such as the frequently adapted so-called filling rules, whereby smaller pieces of agricultural land, nature reserve or simply fallow land between existing houses could be used as building land. A major disadvantage is that relatively many people live along a busy road, so they suffer from air pollution, noise pollution and the danger of traffic.
&gt; 
&gt; This Belgian measure was so successful because it was profitable for small landowners. As a result, people often have little view of the open space from the main Flemish roads. This only becomes visible from the backyards full of mountain cages ('lottery'). Another downside is that Flemish people have to look for quiet country roads in their own region in order to enjoy the natural beauty.
&gt; 
&gt; Since spatial planning has moved from the federal (Belgian) level to the regional (Flemish) level in terms of competence, policy with regard to spatial planning has become stricter. Since then, new ribbon development has fallen sharply. In contrast to the elongated ribbon development, Belgium has a much more compact and concise housing form called the ""garden housing estate"", which was created in the Flemish city of Roeselare at the beginning of the twentieth century. This concept was much copied, for example in the Limburg mining region.

McDonald‚Äôs is trademark trolling, registering trademarks which it has never used and has no intention of using. For instance, they‚Äôve trademarked the words ‚ÄúMcInternet‚Äù and ‚ÄúMcCountry‚Äù, despite never using them. They‚Äôve also trademarked item names, such as ‚ÄúSnackbox‚Äù, which they have never offered, but which Supermac‚Äôs has been offering for years.

Most relevant to this case is the fact that McDonald‚Äôs have apparently registered the name ‚ÄúBig Mac‚Äù not only as the name of a burger but also as the name of a restaurant. There has never been a restaurant named ‚ÄúBig Mac‚Äù. There likely never will be. However McDonald‚Äôs used the existence of this trademark as grounds to object to the name ‚ÄúSupermac‚Äôs‚Äù being used for a restaurant. Objecting on the basis of their own name being ‚ÄúMcDonald‚Äôs‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt have worked because Supermac‚Äôs uses ‚ÄúMac‚Äù and McDonald‚Äôs uses ‚ÄúMc‚Äù. Moreover, with Supermac‚Äôs the ‚ÄúMac‚Äù is at the end of the name whereas with McDonald‚Äôs the ‚ÄúMc‚Äù is at the front. So they registered ‚ÄúBig Mac‚Äù as a restaurant name specifically to block Supermac‚Äôs from expanding into Europe. However the EUIPO has apparently ruled that you can‚Äôt do that, you have to either use it or lose it, and thus have denied them the right to trademark the name ‚ÄúBig Mac‚Äù as a restaurant. The fact that this has also affected their ability to claim a trademark on the name ‚ÄúBig Mac‚Äù as a burger that McDonald‚Äôs‚Äôs lawyers fucked up somehow in the way they tried to register the trademark.

Unlike the LEL, which stressed British identity and patriotism, the WDL was fairly open in its admiration for [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler) and [Nazism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism).[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Defence_League#cite_note-6)Seeking to distance itself from LEL [conservatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism) and to build links with like-minded groups in continental [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe), the party's journals became notorious for their rabid racial hatred.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Defence_League#cite_note-7)By personal conviction Jordan's main belief was in anti-Semitism but, whilst the WDL did stress the [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews) as an enemy ""out-group"", the League also emphasised [anti-immigration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-immigration) rhetoric.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Defence_League#cite_note-Clarke33-8) However the WDL has been contrasted with the [Union Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Movement), a contemporary group led by [Oswald Mosley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Mosley) as, whilst the Union Movement had a coherent ideology that sought to remodel pre-[Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War) fascism, the WDL was more crudely racist and had a much less developed political programme.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Defence_League#cite_note-9) Hans-Georg Betz has characterised the WDL as part of a tendency within British fascist extremism to place a ""*recidivist* or *radical*neo-nazism"" as the ideological core rather than the [populism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism) of [Scandinavian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia) protest parties or the ""*hybrid*appeal"" that fuses elements of fascism to populism typified by the likes the [Front National](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Front_(France)) (italics are after Betz).[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Defence_League#cite_note-10)",,/r/europe/comments/agbbzl/racial_troubles_in_notting_hill_1959_british_path√©/ee4wcmp/,Tavirio,1547575864

4203,"&gt; Why? we are already too much, i'm good with a shrinking population

Are you good with old people living a crap life and your health system going to shit ? Because if you are then fair enough.

&gt; Simple, pension based only on the contributions you made during your work life, people should be financially responsible not going on vacation with their retirement money and then get carried by the state in their old age; state pensions should be given only to the abysmally poor, which there aren't a lot of in Italy unless we import them

I don't get it, do you mean that we should throw away the thing altogether and let eachone do their own thing ?

Even if you do that, you can't apply it retroacively, so you'll already have a good amount of people being supported by few people, not to mention how you'd have tens of millions who payed their taxes and planned their lives according to a certain income and then bam, lost it all out of the blue.

&gt; Only if the other half relies on the state subsidising their retirement, which shouldn't be the case.

Again, you can't apply things retroactively.

4343,"A small business (""microenterprise"") exemption sounds good until you remember that an exemption that carves out businesses with less than EUR10m in turnover means that the 10,000,001st euro a business makes will cost it EUR200-500m in regulatory compliance costs -- which is obviously a death-sentence. 

(In any event, this is moot, as the big rightsholder groups have said that any microenterprise exemption is a dealbreaker and several of them have written to the EP asking to have the whole thing called off rather than create this exemption)

&amp;#x200B;

On to whether filters will break or enhance the monopolies. There's plenty of historic examples here, and they're unequivocal: when firms grow to a certain size and are then deputised to perform social functions that only large firms can afford, they are better equipped to resist calls to break them up. 

Think of AT&amp;T: once it had been allowed to dominate US telcoms, it became critical to things like emergency response and policing (tracing calls, etc). Thereafter, every call to break up AT&amp;T could be met with claims that this would impair its emergency roles (this is partly why it took until 1982 to finally break them up). Moreover, it justified all measure of anticompetitive behaviour, like the insistence that AT&amp;T be the sole manufacturer of phones that customers would have to lease, meaning every AT&amp;T customer bought their phone dozens of times over during the life of their account. Most of those windfall profits went to shareholders, but some were diverted to lobbying to allow them to do more blocking of interoperable products that would weaken their stranglehold.

There are direct analogies to the digital monopolists of today. For example, Facebook was only able to succeed by initially offering users a tool that would import their waiting Myspace messages and allow for them to be replied to from within Facebook. Myspace tried to block this, but FB evaded their blocks: it's impossible to launch a social network competitor without some kind of interop with the incumbent (as many would-be FB competitors have learned). 

If the US Big Tech companies are deputised to run copyright filters, they'll have a readymade excuse for every kind of interop blocking: ""How can we filter out infringement if we have to permit third parties to connect unapproved tools to our systems?""

&amp;#x200B;

You're also right that the same problems with automatically filtering infringement also apply when filtering hate speech. All experience with hate speech filters to date has been terrible: hate speech is heavily context-dependent and not amenable to machine parsing. Importantly, algorithms can't tell the difference between people talking about hate speech and hate speech itself, and that means that victims of hate speech routinely get blocked for discussing their experiences. Meanwhile, harassers have the means, motive and opportunity to learn how to evade the filters. Whatever we do about hate speech, automated filter isn't a promising approach.

&amp;#x200B;

It's different when it comes to the images of the sexual abuse of children, because that is a \*much\* narrower task. We don't ask platforms to assess whether previously unseen images are abuse images, only that they filter out a known corpus of images (and still, they only perform so-so at this). Equally important is that there are \*no\* lawful reproductions of abuse images, while copyright is shot through with limitations and exceptions that allow reproduction without permission, and of course, hate speech isn't just words, it's the context in which those words are said.

Consider a news photog who captures a street scene that includes a bus-ad with some copyrighted stock art. Algorithms can't make a call about whether this is legit (it's covered in at least three ways: fair dealing, right of panorama \[in EU states that have this right\], and \*de minimis\* -- too small for the law to trifle with). This is the same situation that arises when ContentID blocks videos because of some incidental copyrighted background music (for example, erasing all 8 hours of audio from an academic symposium because the rented hall played some licensed, copyrighted music during the lunch break).

But a news photog whose street scene includes an abuse image always violates laws about obscene content, because these abuse images are never lawful to reproduce. The algorithm has a much simpler call to make.

Which is not to say that these abuse image filters are unproblematic. By their nature, the contents of these abuse image lists are secret, and that is an invitation to mischief indeed. Previously leaked versions of the lists of blocked child abuse sites from Denmark, Sweden and Australia showed that more than 95% of what these lists blocked did not qualify as child abuse at all -- rather, it was a grab bag of stuff that regulators just didn't like, from gambling sites to information on assisted suicide.

So if your case for filtering copyright is that it will reduce monopoly power, that's not borne out by history. If it's that small businesses are exempted, that's not born out by facts. If it's that copyright filters will perform as well as hate-speech filters, that's cause for scepticism, not confidence. If it's that copyright filters will work as well as child abuse filters, it's apples and oranges.

I hope this helps.

4344,"Well, I mean, what does ""legally binding"" mean here?

Ordinarily, there's an implicit ""in the eyes of legal authority X"".  And usually we don't need to worry about that, since we all agree on what the legal authority is.  But if a state says ""we no longer recognize this debt as valid"" with the full weight of the state's authority (whatever that bar requires, be it constitutional text or legislation or whatever), then that tells the state's courts that the debt's gone.

Like, let's say that tomorrow, the US passes a constitutional amendment saying ""Treasury bonds are void"".  Which court does someone go to contest that?  A US court is going to say ""Well, the law is pretty clear here.  No debt.""

Maybe you can go somewhere else and find some court willing to claim jurisdiction and try to find someone else who will act based on that claim of jurisdiction.

4494,"&gt; If a stabbed person knocks on your door, do you say 'should've asked the other bloke, he was next to you' and tell them to fuck off ?

Depends. If I hear screams from the street and this happens, I will let the person in and call ambulance.

If, on the other hand, that person gets stabbed and then crosses half the city, passing by 3 hospitals along the way, before calling a taxi to drive him right next to my door, and the blood on his shirt looks suspiciously like ketchup, I'll probably ask him why is he knocking on my door.

&gt; They have the contitutional right to come to Italy and request asylum, and no one can take that away from them (for now at least).

Hopefully they will because this right is abused to the extreme. Also, the Geneva Conventions themselves need to be rethought, because no country or a group of countries can be asked to assume responsibility for people from all over the planet. There has to be regional justice ‚Äì Africa and Arab countries should take care of their refugees first, other regions should aid them if necessary by sending material help and experts, not by lifting this responsibility for them.

4534,"&gt; ate currywurst in a German kebab

Kebab wurst is the worst wurst!

Most currywurst sadly are served as a low quality bratwurst with ketchup and some curry sprinkled on top or with curry-ketchup or with a low-quality curry sauce. The reason (like with all low-quality fastfood) is of course profit.

But in every city, if you ask the locals and really look for it, you can usually find some snack bar or takeaway where the wurst is godlike.

The best wurst I ever had, came with a very fruity, extremely tasty curry-sauce that burned my mouth with just the right amount of spicyness and smothered the pain with a rich and earthy taste of curry and tomato. It was sweat, it was spicy, it was perfect. And the wurst was a very coarse bratwurst, sliced a little thinner than normal and at the same time juicy, tender and dark golden brown on the outside.

It was served with a big helping of thick fries that I used to gather up most of the souce to taste every little bit of it.

The price of 3,50 ‚Ç¨ was really okay considering the amount of sauce and fries and that it was the best currywurst I ever tasted. Sadly, this was served at an event and I do not know who catered there, when the event returned I went again hoping they would have the same caterer and I could ask them where I would find them, but that time they had a different caterer whose currywurst could not compete. :(",R√©publique f√©d√©rale d'Allemagne,/r/europe/comments/ag6khl/germany_just_released_an_unspeakably_ugly_coin/ee40gtx/,Enkrod,1547547241

4596,"&gt; It is for Germans.  
&gt;  
&gt;Not for Russians.

of course it is, Russia is more dependent on the money they get for their gas than Germany is dependent on Russian gas. I find it hilarious that everyone just talks how this makes Germany more dependent on Russia and totally ignores that a different supplier can be found much more easily than it is for Russia to get that money they need. To put it in another way, does this not strengthen the dependency of Russia on Germany.  


Here is part of an Interview with J√ºrgen Trittin where he makes some pretty good points IMHO, sorry for the wall of text but I think it is well worth reading:

  

**SPIEGEL ONLINE**: Opponents of the pipeline criticize Nord Stream 2 for betraying the security interests of countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Don't you care?

**Trittin**: The basic argument, that we are making ourselves dependent on the Russians is wrong. Pipeline gas leads to mutual dependency because there is a strong bond between producer and consumer. The producer is even more dependent if the consumer also has other sources. While Europe could quite easily switch to liquid LNG from the USA or Qatar, Russia cannot switch customers so easily. They would have to build a new pipeline to China. That will take time.

**SPIEGEL ONLINE**: Wouldn't an energy boycott by Europe hit Russia's ruling regime hard?

**Trittin**: Russia's entire economic and political system is based on the export of fossil raw materials. Depending on estimates, up to two thirds of the state budget is financed in this way. The idea that the Russian would turn off the gas tap just for fun is therefore absurd: the Kremlin would deliberately damage itself. Not even the Soviet Union did that during the Cold War.

**SPIEGEL ONLINE**: The USA leads the resistance against the pipeline. The American ambassador in Berlin, Richard Grenell, has called on the German government to finally stop its support for Nord Stream 2.

**Trittin**: I don't know why these pipeline debates have to be conducted every few decades with the same bad arguments. Grenell is now defending the transit route through Ukraine. But when it was built, the then US President Ronald Reagan strongly opposed it. His ambassador in Berlin at that time, Richard Burt, was extremely behind. The construction therefore had to be camouflaged by Deutsche Bank in a special company in Luxembourg so that it could still be financed. The joke is that the then Ambassador Burt is now a lobbyist for Nord Stream 2 - and gets to hear the same arguments from the US side that he himself put forward decades ago.

**SPIEGEL ONLINE**: Grenell warns that ""Russian influence will flow into Europe"" through the pipeline.

**Trittin**: Grenell behaves like a front door representative for American fracking gas. The situation is different for Eastern Europeans. European solidarity is the order of the day: no Eastern European country should be allowed to be blackmailed by Russia. That is guaranteed. Europe today has a common gas transport network and the infrastructure for the so-called reverse flow, i.e. a thrust reversal into the pipelines to the east. And the EUGAL pipeline in eastern Germany would add another building block to this security system.

**SPIEGEL ONLINE**: But it's already contradictory: the EU wants to stabilize Ukraine economically and also helps with money, but at the same time the loss of gas transit would lead to two billion dollars less transit fees for Ukraine. The country has an economic strength of just over 100 billion dollars.

**Trittin**: Unfortunately, this money does not even begin to end up in Ukraine's budget. There are many who - to put it in a friendly way - take a lot of it. In addition, the pipeline network in Ukraine is in a poor state and very susceptible to disruptions. After all, the necessary investments are not being made. If transport were to collapse as a result, a supply problem for Europe could not be ruled out.

**SPIEGEL ONLINE**: Nevertheless, the USA is always insisting on a construction stop for Nord Stream 2. Why?

**Trittin**: There is an all-party consensus in Washington that Nord Stream is evil - just as the old pipeline through Ukraine was evil at the time. The interest in this is laid down transparently in a Senate resolution: It is a question of exporting American liquefied gas to Europe instead. We are not dealing here with a mere political dispute, even though the Americans are happy to pretend so. It is about massive economic interests, about America First in energy policy. Europe must not make that its own.

**SPIEGEL ONLINE**: The German government is trying to negotiate with Moscow that certain guaranteed quantities of gas will continue to be transported via Ukraine in the future.

**Trittin**: And Nord Stream 2 is the lever with which the Russians can be bound to it. If the project is stopped, they would lose it. So I'm not sure whether torpedoing the leadership is such a good idea for Ukraine, even though the Ukrainian leadership is spending a lot of money on lobbyists in Washington.

**SPIEGEL ONLINE**: How credible could such an assurance by the Russians be - where Putin for a decade claimed exactly the opposite? His goal has always been to bypass Ukraine.

**Trittin**: If Russia wants to export the amount of gas it needs to finance its budget, it won't be able to avoid Ukraine. Nord Stream 1 and 2 together won't be able to produce these quantities.

**SPIEGEL ONLINE**: The EU is also pushing ahead with its own project, the so-called ""southern corridor"" to Azerbaijan's gas fields.

**Trittin**: The aim behind the ""southern corridor"" is to secure supplies to southern Europe. I understand that. But the problem is that with this pipeline we are getting gas from an autocrat in Azerbaijan, who is no more a flawless democrat than Putin. He in turn pumps it 2000 kilometres through Turkey and gives the next autocrat named Erdogan the gas tap.

**SPIEGEL ONLINE**: Doesn't Nord Stream 2 thwart exactly Europe's sanctions policy against Russia? Or was their goal not the economic punishment of the Kremlin?

**Trittin**: The sanctions imposed have always left the energy sector far behind. There are not only selfish reasons for this. If people on the other side of the Atlantic come up with the idea of gas, of all things: they would like to sell them a quarter more expensive liquid gas in Europe. In the USA the idea is widespread that Russia could be brought to its knees economically. The majority of Europeans traditionally see things differently: they don't want a nuclear-armed failed state in their neighborhood. This is probably the most important reason for the difference in attitude between the US and many Europeans. We don't think it would be wise to bring Russia to its knees permanently.

&gt; MKO¬† is considered a terrorist group **by Iran** 

From Wikipedia:

&gt;The European Union, Canada and the United States formerly listed the MEK as a terrorist organization, but this designation has since been lifted, first by the [Council of the European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union) in 26 January 2009,[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran#cite_note-Runner-21)[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran#cite_note-UPI2009-22)[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran#cite_note-Reuters2009-23) by the U.S. government on 21 September 2012, and lastly by the Canadian government on 20 December 2012.[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran#cite_note-auto5-24)The MEK is currently designated as a [terrorist organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_designated_terrorist_groups) by [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran) and [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq).[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran#cite_note-bdt45cgf112-25)   
&gt;  
&gt; The MEK contributed in overthrowing the Shah during the Iranian revolution, and subsequently pursued establishing democracy in Iran, gaining support particularly from Iran's middle class intelligentsia.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran#cite_note-28)[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran#cite_note-auto7-29)[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran#cite_note-auto8-30)[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran#cite_note-auto16-31)

No it certainly doesn't. Left and right are just boxes for people to put themselves in to pick teams. They ideologies of the groups change constantly and dramatically. They contradict each other and themselves.

Just because centrist ideals and values aren't extremes doesn't mean they're not ideals and values just the same. They're just more reasonable ideals and values.

Of course I don't, I hadn't been born then. And not for all of these people, but for some, they were teenagers at the time, and when my opinion is deemed invalid by my elders using this argument, it's frustrating, because they were young at the time, where they weren't aware of the politics surrounding them.

In the case of most fines, it were more effective in advancing conformal societal behaviour if it were a function of fine:=max(net wealth * factor_w, net income * factor_i, specific value * factor_s), where specific value might be dependent on the issue, e.g. worth of car at purchase for traffic incidents, or value of real estate for building code violations, etc.",Austria/Hungary,/r/europe/comments/afvqu2/remember_that_gif_about_snow_in_austria_well/ee3srfv/,szpaceSZ,1547534753

This sub is right-leaning. Its obvious, and that's ok. But at least use the same standard and doubt for every incident and not those which align with your political views.

That being said, its fucking sad that someone had to die over politics. The rising hostility helps nobody.

5037,"&gt; Evidently feelings for the EU aren't that great. Even many of the people  who voted to stay did so out of other reasons and don't actually care  about the European project. 

No proofs, just wild claims. I am not surprised.

&gt; They just want to get to spain easier on holiday. The British people don't want anything to do with the European project. 

Do you really not see the contradiction yourself there?

&gt; That is European integration into some federation. Even many remainers  would tell you this. The EU never meant anything more than a common  market and easy holidays for the people of Britain. (same as virtually  everywhere else) That's just a fact. 

Nice fact. This explains, why you could give so many proofs for it, right? How do you even explain, that small countries like Ireland and Denmark do like the EU that much?

[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/more-than-90-of-irish-people-want-to-stay-in-eu-poll-reveals-1.3488112](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/more-than-90-of-irish-people-want-to-stay-in-eu-poll-reveals-1.3488112)

In Ireland 90% would vote remain and in Denmark 77%, although they get abused by the bigger countires? Hmm...

&gt; The only reason most remainers even want to stay is just fear of the repercussions of daring to leave the EU Mafia 

You can leave any time as the Uk just shows us. The EU represents roughly 440 million people and the Uk represents roughly 65 million people. Who do you think has the better position to negotiate? Why would the EU throw candies at the UK? This is actually one of the biggest reasons why the EU is needed. Because otherways all the dwarf-like countries (Germany, France etc included) could not do anything against countires like China or the US. 

&gt; As I said before France and Germany have combined interests. And besides  them other nations in the EU  are poor, weak and easy to take advantage  of, small enough to not shake things up. 

And again no proof or examples, that this has actually happened at any relevant topic. Also, how do these interests even differ to the minority of other countries?

&gt; Yes, if those nations decide to vote together against Franco-Germanic interests, which is unlikely in most cases.

Looking back at it, one of the things that was weird was that there were actually formally social classes:

- worker
- intelligentsia


The could help or hurt in some situations. For instance during university admission peasant or worker background gave you extra points so it happened that candidate A (intelligentsia) got better entrance exams by a small margin over candidate B (worker). The social points would give candidate A admission, while candidate A (in case of males) went to the army for 2 to 3 years, as the military service was compulsory.

Total are scummy, like pretty much every big oil corp, but what they're doing isn't really different than any company exploiting ressources anywhere.

That's my issue with France's position there, to just let a lot of people live in misery in a country with plenty of ressources while it would be pretty easy to force the Bongo to share this wealth at least significantly more.

He'll be up for a ""parole"" in 21 years and unless he crawls on hands and knees, teary eyed in his repentance, swearing that he'll render services to those he wronged for the rest of his life, showing actual changes in his personality and behaviour (something we haven't seen yet)... even THEN he'll be put under scrutiny and most likely put back in prison, where he will remain for the rest of his life. The only reason he hasn't been sent out to the island prison, where other criminals who have committed heinous murders live the simple life in peace and seclusion... is because they'd probably kill him. The guards would probably look the other way. And we don't want that. Capitol punishment is not justice. It is mere revenge, an animalistic intuition that we should never feed.

Unless there is actual tangible change in Breiviks mentality and personality, something he can't fake as the countries leading experts study him like he's Hannibal Lectre; there is no chance in hell he's going to be released in his lifetime.

Besides: kill him and suddenly he'll be a martyr for a few xenophobic nationalists who'd read his manifesto as a Bible. As it stands he was supposed to kill himself before he was caught... but pussed out. We'd much rather remember him as an unstable psycho than a political martyr.

5119,"&gt;I don't blame May for trying, mind you. It's been entirely reasonable to do so, and has nothing to do with ""divide and conquer"", as some suggested at the time. The fact of the matter is exactly as you say: So far, the EU hasn't blinked once, and it hasn't blinked once because it can count on the full support of the 27 members on this side of the rope, and those 27 members are supporting it because they think it's in their best interest to do so.

Arguably they have managed to maintain discipline to the extent that it has been, because there was a negotiated agreement that hasn't been reopened and the agreement was essentially limited to EU competencies. Essentially, the 27 members are supporting it because shifting causes issues for them and everyone else.

&gt;But take that point and apply it to your own argument:

I'd have to take the reverse of the argument.  The EU is unified under an agreement and so have been able to hold the line somewhat, the UK isn't, there is no unified position, and there has to be a positive choice (so people *doing* something to move forward. That's the issue..

Oh and as to the EU being unified, we'll see where that ends up. It's not as though the UK agreeing on the WA is the last step here.. But on to your first point

&gt; Why do you think, after all that's happened those past two years and all the options which have been exhausted and gotten us nothing but a stalemate, that Whitehall and Westminster have not come to the conclusion (or will do so in the coming weeks) that scrapping the whole thing would be less hazardous than pretending to go along with it?

Because they are not unified in any given position.  There isn't support for any given outcome at this point, only a potential majority against no deal (which perversely is the only thing that doesn't require a majority..).  For the UK not to leave without a deal requires either a vote accepting the withdrawal agreement or the repealing of the existing exit legislation. That requires the Government to act and Parliament to agree to it. 

And just to be clear, there can't be some secret plan to reverse it at the last minute, because that secret plan wouldn't survive long enough to be activated (you'd need a majority of MP's to agree to it, and agree not to make it public in advance, I'm reasonably sure that'd leak rather rapidly..). If there is no plan, but rather a thought that at the last minute the government will introduce legislation reversing the exit process (even though they have said they haven't) there is no guarantee that it'd get the support of the opposition, never-mind a majority of the government benches so... that seems unlikely.

&gt;As I've said, to me this has been clear since late October last year.

What has been? The government and opposition have been clear that the UK is leaving, there is legislation in place to do that, there is nothing to suggest a reversal is likely at all.

&gt;No, they don't. All they require is tabling legislation in the Commons and a simple majority to pass it.

Yes, so all we need is the government to table legislation that they have said they won't table, and get a majority in a Parliament where the government only just about has a working majority, to support legislation that for a lot of MP's is going to be pretty toxic. Again, there would be no guarantee that the governments own MP's would support it, never mind opposition MP's

&gt; The EU itself has signalled multiple times that it won't object in any event to delay or cancel. And as to Whitehall, if the recent declarations from Mrs May are worth anything at all, the message was that she herself will turn around and lead the cancellation if her deal doesn't pass in the Commons.

No, the message from May to her own hard leave grouping is that if they don't support her withdrawal agreement, the UK may not leave, while her message to her pro-EU groupings is that if they don't support her withdrawal agreement the UK will leave with no-deal. And again, even if May were to turn around and lead a 'cancellation' there is no guarantee she'd manage to get it through Parliament.

&gt;By contrast, maintaining the UK's current collision course (i.e. upholding the stalemate and watching the wagon race toward the precipice while consciously doing nothing) has a much higher political (let alone economical) cost than putting in the brakes. -- That's my point.

I'm really not sure it does have a higher political cost, in fact I'm reasonably sure it doesn't. A second referendum might just about have been manageable, cancelling brexit because the government failed to get a withdrawal agreement that they could pass isn't manageable. There would be fairly massive backlash (again, justifiably) and it'd turn the EU into a major domestic political issue in a way it hasn't been for a long time. You'd end up in a similar situation that we have been in for the last two years (Where remain basically continued arguing the referendum..) but instead with people arguing the UK should leave the EU (and likely immediately rather than via the A50 process) and pointing out quite rightly that a huge swathe of the population had been essentially betrayed by the 'political establishment'. It'd be carnage.  

&gt;And let me say that I enjoy discussing it with you, not least because it's a huge relief to see that two adults can debate these things without going down in flames and parting ways as enemies just because they disagree on certain policy issues.

Ha, yeah, it's always nice when it works! And I will say that one of the disappointments I've had over the last couple of years has been the lack of people really wanting to discuss and debate the shape of the UK's exit, instead re-fighting the referendum (from both sides..)..  

And tomorrow is going to be fun

5217,"&gt;The outcome of a billion transactions done by people's own free volition is not a manifestation of their will at large.

If those billion people wanted to make a law saying that ""everyone must start a business"", they could.  But, well, they don't.

I think, if I understand where you're going, that you don't want that will to be *before* the risks are taken.  I think that what you're aiming at doing is discounting the risk and saying ""*after* the risks have been taken and we know which the winning company is, we could have workers act as a unit, and if they had monopoly power over Amazon's labor force, they could demand a larger chunk of risk-free money, above market rate, which they couldn't do without that labor monopoly""?  Could be.  But if you adopt a system like that, it has plenty of problems:

* If you drive up the cost of labor at one retailer, the other retailer just dominates.  A success factor becomes ability to union-break, and becomes more-dominant the larger the increase in wages.

* If all retailers are dealing with organized strikes and they manage to drive up the cost of labor, then that cost is getting passed on to the consumer.  That's not primarily coming from Beezos' pocket ‚Äî in fact, insofar as online retailers cut into the need for human labor in brick-and-mortar retailers, you've arguably weighted things more towards him.

    Of course, then you have people arguing that there should be a tax on more labor-efficient way of doing things, like robots and whatnot to try to deal with *that*, and that goes down its own rabbit hole‚Ä¶

* If your country does drive the value of labor up above market rate (like, all retail workers require a license and only 50,000 or whatever are allowed a new license per year), then everyone in the labor market on the outside of the company becomes your enemy, as they're trying to get in.

    Normally, wages act as the market's instrument to direct people to where need is ‚Äî pay for someone to package goods isn't that high because there are a lot of people who can already package things in the labor market.  In that sort of system, people are discouraged not by wages, but by unemployment.  People try to get into the company and just wind up without a job.

* And then, because there are people clamoring at the door to get in, this company can reduce perks and working conditions.  Well, then you can try to legislate down every single possible way in which the company can exchange working conditions for a return, but there are a lot of those.

* The next would-be Beezos that tries to operate with  those restrictions is gonna be clobbered by a competitor in a country that doesn't do that and builds up first.  If the would-be Beezos doesn't go elsewhere to start his would-be Amazon.

* Finally, let's say that all the above is addressed, somehow.  You isolate your economy, make it illegal for people to leave, I dunno, just cope with some of the issues.  So you say ""nobody who starts a  business or invests in that business is allowed to make more than $10 million a year in asset appreciation, and for every bit above that, they need to hand over those assets to workers at the company,, hiring more to keep them below some given amount"".  You disincentivize people doing what Beezos did.  Sure, most people will quit their job for $10 million a year.  But Beezoas didn't take $10 million ‚Äî he took a *chance* at a lot.  Beezos probably made more money from starting his company than anyone else alive in the world today.  But everyone else will make less, and a lot will fail.  He's factoring that uncertainty in, as are his early investors.  

    ""Well, then, we should take the extra and give it to failed businessmen trying startups instead of workers at Amazon.  That internalizes the externality while still being a more-even distribution of wealth.""

    It'll internalize the risks of starting a business, but it also impacts those subsidized business incentive to have the company succeed.   Mitigating risk is already an option available, anyway, since Beezos could have offered investors a greater or lesser chunk of the company.  Beezos chose to put a lot of his eggs in one basket, and got the best basket out there.

5240,"&gt;That's certainly true, but this is not one of those occasions. 

It might not be, but there is nothing to suggest that either way at this point.

&gt;May has tried to play that card (playing one EU member against the other and both against Brussels) and had to return home empty-handed every time, most decisively after the Salzburg summit.

That's not the same card is it? And in any case, this isn't a 'card' being played so much as a political issue appearing unsolvable, unless someone decides that the negatives are worse than some sort of compromise.

 &gt;And even if Barnier &amp; Company would like to, they couldn't play that game since even they can't go around the Council, which has to approve everything. And there is no way on earth that the Council will roll around on this.

Right, so we have a problem. However given May can't unilaterally pull A50, there isn't apparent support from Parliament for any of the exit options and there is legislation in place to take the UK out, there are not a huge number of other options. 

&gt;But you still try to convince me to change a position on the false premise that I'm arguing one. I'm not. I'm making a prediction - that doesn't mean I'm in favour of the result.

My point is that at present the UK is on a course to exit, the scenarios that keep the UK in the EU are pretty unlikely and require consent from multiple parties, moreover, leaving with a deal and remaining would seem to require a similar amount of less likely things to happen, leaving without a deal doesn't require anything other than the clock to be run down.

Even though it had a very high turn out alot of voter just didn't turn up and when speaking to them at the time they said they didn't as they were undecided or genuinely thought remain would win. I think Scotland will lobby for a leave again but don't think parliament will allow it within the next 10 years. The NI gain too much money from West Minster and will see an even bigger drop in life style if they integrated back to IRE. It would also cause the factions to start up again. The best case now is to get a deal that allows us to leave. I would like to see it stopped but to remain as a proper world player we have to leave. But after tomorrow's vote gets voted down I hope a new strategy gets put forward to 're do a deal. This means article 50 gets pushed back and we stay in for the foreseeable future. Then when negotiations are back on they won't be rushed and can be done in proper fashion just like the Canada trade deal which took 7 years to do.

5309,"&gt;You mean to tell us that after the deal has failed in parliament (which at this point is a given), 

Probably, it really does depend on whether there is any scope for change or 'assurances' that deal with the criticism..

&gt;Whitehall and Westminster both will fold and sit idly by for ten excruciatingly long weeks, watching in horror and utter disgust how events unfold which neither side except a certain fringe group of fundamentalists has ever wanted or a majority of the people who set this in motion ever voted on.

No, I didn't say that. It'd assume that there will be continued pressure and a lot of work to either find a way to get a withdrawal agreement in place, or mitigate any exit.  What I don't think will happen is that Parliament and the Government will get together and decide to simply bin leaving.

And again, it is a fringe group of fundamentalists that wanted the UK to leave without negotiating, it was a larger fringe group that want to leave with no-deal, but there is a very large group that want the UK to leave the EU (preferably with an agreement in place, but the aim is to leave..).

Everyone is in shock still and most of the ruling party politicians try not to show themselves in front of a camera at all, and once they have to say something in public they talk abut general things: grief, condolences, thoughts and prayers and so on. Opposition politicians actually show up in TV studios but also refrain from any aggression, they mostly talk about their personal connections with late Adamowicz (he was an active politician since the 90s so he was well known to most of the MPs).

I've heard various scenarios for the future. Many people think nothing will change, and I guess that's the most probable course of action.
For sure there will be a lot of actions taken by the government just for the show - maybe the killer will be paraded in shackles in front of the minister for justice, maybe they will prosecute the owners of the security company that was supposed to protect the charity event, I think they will try to make the funeral a national ceremony with the president and prime minister giving speeches.
Some people talk about possible severe repercussions against civil liberties - the killing can be used as an excuse to block some street protests (e.g. Polish teachers are getting angry right now), political events, festivals and concerts and so on. 

I  was pleasantly surprised by the Polish Prime Minister - he was supposed to name an acting mayor in Gda≈Ñsk, which seemed like a perfect opportunity to place their own guy in the seat, but (allegedly) decided to name the actual vice-president of Adamowicz.

5389,"&gt;The RoI is doing whatever the EU wants because the EU can and will throw it under the bus if it doesn't. The backstop is an attempt to get the UK to cancel Brexit, nothing more. It is a way for the EU to force a binary choice between no-deal and no-Brexit without having to say as much directly.

Still you gave no sources to support that claim. I however provided sources of the opposite, that EU demands backstop because RoI demands it. 

You couldn't provide sources for your claims nor could you provide sources which prove my sources wrong.

Therefore as I have sources for my claim, you have none, there's no reason to take your claim seriously. Your claim can be dismissed.

&gt;It allows the EU to control the UK for an eternity.

It's not ridiculous. It's very in line with the Good Friday Agreement which aims to make cooperation with NI and RoI possible and easy and avoid division. Hard border in Ireland would be a slap against this aim.

The Brexit deal specifically says this:

""*The objective of the Withdrawal Agreement is not to establish a permanent relationship between the Union and the United Kingdom. The provisions of this Protocol are therefore intended to apply only temporarily, taking into account the commitments of the Parties set out in Article
2(1).""

""*The Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude, by 31 December 2020, an agreement which supersedes this Protocol in whole or in part.*""

Only in the case UK does not want to make a replacing deal and ignore the goal and purpose of the Brexit dea, the backstop enters into force. The backstop is a temporary arrangement until a deal is made. If the UK does not want backstop to happen, it simply negotiates and strikes a deal with EU which replaces backstop. 

&gt;I have no doubt that RoI would prefer to have a temporary backstop agreed than a permanent one that hasn't. Unfortunately for them, the permanence of the backstop has become a goal in itself for the EU which simply means there will be no backstop whatsoever.

The current backstop is supposed to be a temporary arrangement until a deal is made. It's stated in the deal that it's supposed to be temporary, not ""eternal"".

&gt;&gt;True, but the transition period negotiations for trade deal and post-transition period relations have not even started yet, because UK is refusing the negotiations. So it's a bit early to complain about the trade deal and post-transition period relations, since such a deal has not even been negotiated yet.

&gt;Nope, the EU is insisting on the sequencing still. 

Yea, but that means the deal currently on the table does not include the deal about the post-transition period, so it's a bit early to criticize the post-transition deal.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/aftoya/may_no_brexit_more_likely_than_no_deal/ee2949v/,Toby_Forrester,1547490287

5442,"To explain Sweden's political situation;

There are 3 blocks.

The left block: S, V, MP.

The alliance (right wing coalition): M, C, L, KD

And SD has its own little block. 

These 3 blocks are in constant war. The alliance will optimally vote for them with M in the lead, the left block with S in the lead and SD only votes for themselves. 

In order to form a government in Sweden the proposal needs a majority of mandates from Riksdagen. The left block and the alliance got about 40% of mandates each, and SD holds the remaining 20%. 

This is problematic, since no block will gain a majority if the other 2 blocks vote against it. Our election was in September, and all proposals have been rejected. 

Then a few days ago came the proposal of a government consisting of S, MP, C and L. S and MP  voted for it, since their block gets the prime minister from S. Now the alliance would NEVER collaborate with S. Until C came out and said theyd vote for it. 

This crushed the alliance. A political teamwork that got them 8 years in government was now shattered. And after that, L agreed to vote for it too, with the motivation that V and SD gain nothing from this (they are ""extremist"" parties). 

But S, MP, C and L mandates still aren't enough. The remaining parts of the Alliance (M and KD) will of course vote against it, and SD voting against anything that doesnt include themselves. 

Now when I said V was part of the left block, thats not entirely true. They have no official teamwork with S or MP, but tend to vote with them due to how similar opinions they have. 

But V is voting No to this government. They cant vote for C and L even if it gives us a government. Its too right wing for them. 

There will be another proposal after this one, and my guess is a V, S, MP, C, L government. Because if that fails, we'e gonna have a re-election, and C and L will likely fall out of riksdagen in that case.

And everyone who doesn't spend a lot of money on their child is suspicious. 

That's why children who start school now celebrate with a bouncy castle in the garden. You also have to take your child to Spain during summer vacation because spending time with his grandparents in the forest will get him laughed at. Regular visits to the cinema and amusement parks are a must too. And if your 12 year old has a birthday party you better have a Dj. Handing your old phone to your child also doesn't cut it anymore. 


Millions of people on welfare show that it doesn't need a lot of money to raise a child properly. But these are suspicious parents and suspicious children, so better keep your own children away from them. Don't want to have them catch the poor, do you? Send them on a private school. And there goes even more of your money.

Democracy is the sovereignty of the people, that's litterally what it means : from greec dƒìmokrat√≠a, literally ""Rule by 'People'""

Would you choose to kill your neighbour? Maybe you would have in ancient greece, but it had pretty nothing to do with democracy. Would you now? Then why the majority of people would?

Essentially rather than really having a debate on what the UK exit should look like and putting together a nice, close relationship, we had hard brexiteers calling to 'just leave now' and quite a lot on the remain side continuing the referendum campaign and arguing for remain..

* We also make a lot of very good wine (Murfatlar, Tohani, Cotnari etc)
* Romania is quite ethnically diverse, besides the better known Hungarian, German and Roma communities there's also a lot of other (smaller) ethnic groups like: Turkish, Tatar, Macedonian, Serbian, Ukrainian, Lipovan, Greek, Polish, Slovak etc. Simona Halep and Gheorghe Hagi, one of the most well-known Romanian sports persons are of Macedonian ethnicity.
* Due to it having a large number ports both on the Danube and on the Black Sea, the region of [Dobrogea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobruja) is the one that is home to a lot of the small communities summed up above and includes the largest Muslim community in Romania (absolutely and perfectly integrated). 
* Apparently the previous inhabitants of this land [(the Dacians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacians#Physical_characteristics)) were quite fair skinned, with blue eyes and light hair. We owe our more darker look to the Roman Empire.
* On May 1st it's a tradition that we go to party at the seaside (don't ask me why, it's freaking cold)
* The Romanian folklore doesn't have any vampires but we have a lot of werewolves, witches and [undead scary things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strigoi)
* Due to our Orthodox nature and since most of the writing begun in churches we used the Cyrilic alphabet until 1860 when we went back to the Latin alphabet (the Latin alphabet was initially used until around the 10th century).

5869,"Yeah, I think our viewpoints met somewhere halfway. UK's trade is 50% EU 50% something else. I wouldn't count on the solidarity of the EU in trade relations. There's a workforce shortage everywhere so who cares if 10k jobs disappear across Europe? At least that's going to be the thinking. 

Ireland will be fine. Remember how many people said Europe is fucked when we stopped trading with Russia? It took like 2 weeks to reorganise sales and ship somewhere else. That's what we lost. It took 6 months for Russia to negotiatie an acceptable trade deal with China and even then China won a lot more on it because Russia was cornered and needed a deal fast.

What's going to happen is Hungarian and Polish farmers will tone down the agricultural products Ireland will be overproducing and just produce corn, soy or grains instead. They have a lot of experience in preparing for such things. Btw. UK gives 10% of Ireland's exports, of which only a fraction is agricultural products (15%), so don't overhype the loss there.

As I said, you will be able to sign trade deals with fewer regulations and more flexibility, but those deals are going to take time to sign. And the more time it takes the more desperate the talks will be, and the bigger loss on the treaty. Don't think the USA will not jump on a weakened UK like a vulture. They will force a trade deal through that allows all US products enter unrestricted (that's what they wanted with the EU at least, no reason to believe they would sign a smaller market on worse terms) which means the economy of the UK will be on the mercy of US companies. They can flood the market with cheap products and suffocate local businesses, buy them and go out. That's why trade deals are very important to sign with local intererests in mind.

I'm not anti-Rutte (many in the Netherlands are these days, Rutte's popularity is at a record low), far from it even, but this is so disgustingly obvious and so typical VVD. Makes me vomit in my mouth.

It's also why the VVD claims to be so-called ""Euroskeptic"", just like Rutte himself, while in reality, they are not. But they *have* to say it (or so they think) in order to keep the far-right voters happy.

For me, this hypocritical behavior is one of the reasons not to vote for this party. I actually care about honesty and decency, and you often don't find that at the VVD (on a side note, it's the party with the most '[political scandals](https://www.vn.nl/de-lijst-politieke-affaires-van-1983-tot-2013/)' in the [Netherlands](https://eenvandaag.avrotros.nl/item/vvd-opnieuw-partij-met-meeste-integriteitschandalen/)).

Higher wages in EE, some northern countrys and most importantly Germany will lead to the Euro devaluing and as a result will make the south competitive again. It will also fuel demand in Germany, reduce our trade surplus and make the German economy less dependent on Exports.
