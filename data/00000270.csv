They were self-centered around the interests of another part of the oligarchy, being under threat by it. Financiers, banks, corporations, e.t.c. whose interest was connected to that of the EU, instead of being limited (inside the country). Merely two sides of the same coin.

**The 4,800 bots that cheered the 'proc√©s'**

*A legion of automated accounts viralized news from RT and Sputnik during the 20 most intense days of the secessionist challenge *

A group of 4,883 automatic Twitter profiles systematically disseminated media messages financed by the Kremlin on the independence process in Catalonia. They did it during 20 of the most intense days of the secessionist challenge, between September 29 and October 19. The messages produced by these media were shared more than 84,000 times in the social network by some 38,000 accounts. Almost 13 out of 100 of the accounts that broadcast the messages about Catalonia from the RT chain or the Sputnik agency were, with probability, bots (profiles of Twitter programmed to spread tweets automatically), according to a study by the company of social network analytics Audiense

Of all the information generated by the television channel and the Russian agencies, the bots chose especially those referring to the Catalan conflict to retweet. They chose above all the channel in Spanish of RT on Twitter, which with its 2.88 million followers exceeds the English version, with 2.66 million. Of the 10 messages of all the RT informative production in Spanish most re-disseminated by bot users , eight referred to Catalonia. In the case of the English version, this happened with seven of the ten most shared.

Two of the messages exceeded each one, only due to the effect of the retweeting of the bots accounts, more than half a million potential impacts, the possibility of appearing in the timeline of a user who follows who shared the content. In one case, the tweet entitled 'Dictatorship' Venezuelan vs. 'democracy' Spanish referred to a video RT in which praised the virtues of the Venezuelan political system against Spanish. The followers of the analyzed accounts that retweeted it had a total of 511,707 followers. Some less (506,534) had those of the bot accounts that decided to retweet another video that purported to ridicule an alleged accusation by EL PA√çS of the RT chain to conspire in favor of Catalan independence. The third most widespread tweet (496,001 potential impacts), referred again to a video in similar line (""When you talk about democracies that impede the vote and dictatorships that allow it, it's time to rethink some things,"" read the message). 

RT RTT in English most widespread by the accounts analyzed.

With a number of potential impressions also very high the group redifundi√≥ the editorial messages of RT that alerted on incidents with shots (""Sounds of shots while the Police load against a group of demonstrators in Barcelona"" with 449.756 potential impressions) or of the presence of right-wingers in the march against the separation of Catalonia (""Nazi greetings in the march in favor of Spain in Barcelona"", 284,373 potential impressions).

In the account in English, the most popular tweet included an interview with the pro-independence MEP Ramon Tremosa. ""Maybe Madrid is saying that 'we are not a Spanish population, since they hit us in the streets like animals'"", picked up the tweet, with 201,678 potential impressions. After this, the most spread messages on Twitter mentioned a count of 38 injured against ""activists"" by the police on the day of the referendum (201,678 potential impressions) and the English version of the tweet on the greetings of right-wingers (177,397 impressions) .

The activity of bots around the pro-Russian conversation of the Catalan challenge is much greater than that of others generated on Twitter in Spain, such as the 26J elections. The analysis also shows that the percentage of accounts that have shared the messages described that demonstrate suspicious activities of automation are much greater than phenomena so linked to the dissemination of commercial messages, such as the celebration of the past Black Friday. 

**Suspicious accounts of being 'bots'**

The analysis offers much higher values ‚Äã‚Äãthan in other conversations on Twitter.

|Media|8,45%|2,88%|2,1%|0,06%|

Criteria in the table: Major: &lt;10,000 followers and&gt; 100 tweets / day. Average: &lt;10,000 followers and&gt; 50 tweets / day and followers / followers ratio &lt;1.5. Minor: &lt;10,000 followers and&gt; 50 tweets / day

The ascending tendency of creation of the accounts that at some point have spread the messages of the Russian media has remained constant almost every month. The date of activation of the first dates back to 2008, but 24.5% have been created in 2017 (until October 18). Only in September, the last month with complete data, 202 were created, more than in any previous one. 

[excluded image showing account creation date]

Twitter reacted a few weeks ago against RT and Sputnik by partially restricting its broadcast . On October 26, the social network announced that it would not issue any more publicity, considering that ""both RT and Sputnik tried to interfere in the US elections on behalf of the Russian Government,"" and referring to the report of the US intelligence office. However, the social network does maintain its free profiles and the organic (unpaid) dissemination of its contents.

&gt;Inset: RT and Sputnik, Russian government propaganda
&gt;
&gt; RT is a television network owned by the Russian Government. The initials refer to Russia Today, the first name of the medium. Sputnik is an agency, web portal and radio of the news agency Rosilla Segodnya, controlled by the Russian government. Both RT and Sputnik broadcast their messages in several languages, including Spanish.
&gt;
&gt;Last January, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence of the US accused RT and Sputnik of being a ""State propaganda machine of Russia"" in a report and of inferring in the American electoral campaign by denigrating Hillary Clinton and supporting Donald Trump.
&gt;
&gt;The EU working group East Stratcom , which was conceived in 2015 to detect and combat hoaxes mostly broadcast by Russia in the media in countries east of the EU, has denounced the publication of numerous false publications by both media. The EU has endowed this work against foreign propaganda with 800,000 euros in its budgets for 2018 . According to an investigation by Forbes magazine , Sputnik's predecessor agency-RIA Novosti-manipulated statements by Obama's press secretary, Josh Earnest, to show him a supporter, falsely, of punishing Russia for its attacks in Aleppo on rebel groups to the president.

HOW THIS ANALYSIS HAS BEEN DONE

Key dates of the 'proc√©s'. The observed tweets and retweets were broadcasted on Twitter from September 29 to October 19. That period includes the dates between the last day of the campaign of the illegal independence referendum and the publication of the letter from Carles Puigdemont to Mariano Rajoy in which he threatened to submit the declaration of independence of Catalonia to a vote in the Parliament. Between both events there was the hectic day of the illegal referendum of 1-O , the Catalan general strike and the so-called 'country stop', both of October 3, the declaration of independence in the Parliament of the 10th proclaimed by Puigdemont and suspended seconds later, and the entry into prison of 'the Jordis' , on October 16. 

The data sample. Between those dates, a total of 38,269 Twitter accounts shared links or RT or Sputnik content that mentioned Catalonia. The detected tweets and retweets were those issued in Spanish, Catalan or English. They shared this content more than 84,000 times.

Also EU is the second largest economy in the world which is free from US to have it's own foreign policy. US recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, EU did not. US withdrew from the Paris agreement, none of the EU countries did (and US is the *only country in the world* not part of the Paris agreement. Even Syria and North Korea agreed on it). EU is free to make its own trade agreements with for example Japan, without US dictating what to do. The EU-Japan free trade deal recently made is the largest free trade agreement ever made.

Also considering your claim European countries are just client states, you are doing a horribly shitty control on your client states, as you have for years failed to reach a free trade agreement with your own client state, which requires higher consumer production than you offer for your citizens.

We should send to the EU the most qualified people of the country and demonstrate that we're worth being considered important.  Sending unqualified people tells the EU we don't care, therefore they won't care about us. So now the EU doesn't have interest in Italy, Italian politicians can blame the EU for many problems, rally support, and get re-elected.

296,"&gt;I'm really surprised that Serbia still didn't accept Kosovo's independence.

Don't be, it will stay like this for a long time, same with Ukraine and Crimea. 
&gt;Anyone from Serbia has any idea how much longer Serbia will wait to retake Kosovo or recognise it?

Recognize - probably if we get a good compensation for the lost territory and goods.  
Retake it - when the US/NATO stops supporting it, Kosovo has no army so it wouldn't be much of a fight.  
&gt;This current state certainly is not benefitting any side.

It's beneficial to us, Kosovo is worsening day by day, people are leaving, unemployment rising, economy barely kept alive by foreign aid. It's beneficial because sooner or later the EU/US or whoever, will get tired of dumping truckloads of cash in the economic black hole just to keep some base there. As long as it isn't in any meaningful organization, or recognized by a good number of countries (some started revoking recognitions too!), it won't function properly, and therefore will fail.  
about 40% of Kosovo's population is under the poverty line, 30% is unemployed etc, that can't bode well for it.

327,"It is fought in the way that these people are trying to become accepted by the majority. In the early days of the US swedes and irish weren't considered white. Now they are. Ingroup is a lot nicer than outgroup.

Stoning of gays is sadly common place in many parts of the world. 

When I mean progress I mean progress in the sense that we as a global society become more accepting and caring of others, if you consider this a bad thing well then it's your definiton. I also meant progress as in the case of judical and societal norms getting closer to the academic moral consensus on certain topics in practical ethics. Not everyone is a nihilist. 

Yes UK and US are no saints. Making progress in some areas doesn't mean you are good, all nations have blood on their hands. You should critique when critique is due, and praise when praise is due. 

Yes from a naturalistic perspective it's not important for the majority to put homosexuals in an ingroup. But I ask you is there no case to be made that a society can be judged on how they treat the weakest? This is laid out by John Rawls, one of, if not the most important and influential political scientist of the 20th century. 

""Biologically speaking gay people are well already a dead end in survival."" Are you a social darwinist? Honestly who gives a shit about the ""survival"" of homosexuality. It's a naturally occuring phenomenom in some mammals. It's just one of thousands of traits an individual can have. But people have through out history been giving people unwarranted shit for having this certain trait. Maybe with exception from medieval Japan and ancient Greece this is the best time and place for gay people to be alive since recorded history. This is something western europeans think is a good thing. We recognize the fact that in most parts of the world it's still not fun to be a homosexual, and even here in Sweden it's not entirely accepted yet even among the younger generations. But we are getting damn close to it. This is something we see as having value in itself, it goes with egalitarianism and ideas of democracy. And for a country like mine the left connects it with their socialist roots.

346,"&gt; Generally, USA has been the staunchest pusher of a united Europe

that's why I said that the US sponsored the creation of the EU, no denying that it was in your and in our interest to unite against Soviet influence. But the Republicans as well as some of the Democrats (even if I believe that their lobbying counts more than party allegiances) do not like the way the European commission has often taken stances that hurt US businesses. Abuse of dominant position is one example, but there is also Apple dodging the system to pay less taxes (and Tim Cook being shamelessly unapologetic about it), EU health and safety preferences clashing with big US companies,etc. 

I guess it's because our conservative parties and even many of our far right parties do not embrace the true path to prosperity, aka unbridled Reaganomics, abolition of welfare state and low taxation to the rich (all things that have been experimented with but not fully practised here, not even in the UK). 

And you would be wrong about Brexiteers. Sure, many would like a divided Europe because their government would be able to negotiate better terms, but a lot of them, some might say a majority, also are at odds with the way the refugee crisis has been handled. One recurrent accusation is that Brexit happened because Angela Merkel allowed into Europe a million refugees (even though those refugees were already squatting in squalid conditions in Greece, in Budapest, etc and even if Germany took a decision that affected only Germany, since refugees do not enjoy freedom of movement as we European citizens do). Or that the EU was to blame for the refugee crisis (even though the EU institutions do not have significant powers to react to these scenarios, that would require a transfer of competences from the national governments to the EU, so basically more centralisation, which the Brexiteers are extremely opposed to). 

Russia is the top crypto enemy, but we are waking up to the dangers of Putin's foreign policy more and more.

Actually it's also bad news for France who wants to remain an independent power and not tie its military and therefore foreign policy to EU, because that means tying it to NATO.

This move is mostly for Eastern Europe, because they have a pushy neighbour and they need to have sufficient defence. Better EU than NATO. Unfortunately this EU defence project is intertwined with NATO, making more countries dependent on US material and standards rather than less.

Also a more military inclined Germany is not an idea I enjoy. It already has economic power, it should not seek to also acquire military and diplomatic leadership for a balanced EU.

374,"How have I misinformed? Those straw-man revisions to my statements are yours alone. I never said the EU has no jurisdiction over Poland as an EU member. I question whether the EU has jurisdiction for the precise matter and on the precise basis it asserts (via the EC; the Commission) under the following shorthand analysis:

The Commission is relying on article 2 to get to article 7 enforcement under the Lisbon treaty. For questionable reasons, the Commission is emphasizing rule of law in its releases (see below) over and over again despite the fact that the strongest case appears to be the obvious discrimination on the basis of gender prohibited under article 2 (""non-discrimination... and equality between men and women prevail"") and present in the legislation in question. The legislation varies retirement age for male judges at 65 and women at 60. As for asserting the breach of rule of law, the best I have seen argued is that Article 19 (1) spells out the rule of law breach (""Member States shall provide remedies sufficient to ensure effective legal protection in the fields covered by Union law.""), but there's no standard of review clearly specified here. If I had to argue it, I'd focus on the ""sufficient"" and ""effective"" language and argue the matter isn't even ripe for EC review because we have not the facts and circumstances of an actual case of first impression in which the Commission can assess with particularity the sufficiency or effectiveness of any such denial of the rule of law. As an American lawyer, I am presuming ripeness is even a doctrine in EU jurisprudence; I have no idea so I am poking brains around here for kicks. In any case, it's not clear ministerial removal of a judge denies rule of law. Judges are swapped on cases regularly, though not especially frequently, in the jurisdictions in which I practice. The change of a judge is not the change of a substantive law; nor does it prohibit the application thereof by the next judge. Frankly, removal is desirable and necessary where a judge has an interest in the matter and fails to recuse herself or himself. Removal does not change the rights, duties and availability of justice for parties in a given case. I cannot speak to what it is like in Europe, but to assert, as the Commission does, that either ministerial removal or the careerist concerns of a judge relative to the minister's influence denies rule of law for third parties is a rather bold assertion by said Commission. 

http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-3186_en.htm 

Until I get tired of musing about this matter, I'll ask, what precedent is there for this in all of Europe and EU law? If there is none, then there's plenty of room to question the basis for jurisdiction under Article 2 with respect to the ministerial powers under the legislation. Questioning such actions by a government body is what democratic values and democratic society is all about. Spare your chastisement for those who deride such speech. Regards.

There had been many different groups living there for hundreds to over a thousand years (Slavs, Turks, Romance language speakers, Sephardi Jews). Macedonia has been more than just Greek for a long time. 

Obviously no one should apologize for being a victim of genocide. Please don't take what I wrote to mean that. I even understand Greek security concerns at the time of the cold war.

I believe it's immoral to not let people marry eachother because of some trait they had no part in deciding. Majority is not always right. That's why we have constitutional protection, international law, and the declaration of human rights.

As for your first point. I am not sure which part of my comment you are quoting. Yes homosexuality has always been a think, it's a mix of biological, psychological and sociological factors. More and more people take the step out of the closet everyday. LGBTQ people are not going anywhere short of a mass killing from an intolerant majority (which I doubt will happen). 

""And people really don't have to accept that and deal with the fact and give them equal recognition. It is the will of the people. If they don't want to, they really don't have to.""

Sure sure, so if Nazi germany won, kept slavs as slaves but introduced voting for the german majority you would say the same thing?

You seem to have an overly naturalistic or even possible darwinistic view of the world. Most people thankfully don't share this view. Like I wrote before.

472," It's a shared history of exploration and discovery pioneered by the likes of Portugal, Spain, England and France, a history of trading ideas and competing intellectually with one another whether it was Leibniz and Newton, or Gallileo and Francis Bacon, or even Locke and Kant, it is a constant process of conversation between ourselves that has defined the European experience. 

In many ways, it is also the religious wars of the 16th and 17th century which has taught us the folly of intolerance, that just being 'Christian' does not automatically guarantee peace between us, and the need for us to balance Protestant and Catholic toleration equally.  

I would say the greatest experience we have had so far is the constructive and inter-governmental efforts of all of Western Europe after WWII. After WWII, we saw how much devastation fighting had caused us, we saw how horrifically the Jews had been treated in Auschwitz and by the Nazis. I might not like every aspect of the European Union, but the European Economic Area worked wonders to foster unprecedented cooperation between all countries in Europe, including Britain, and we came to value democracy, diversity and liberty even more so as we progressed in defiance to the USSR powers assembled on the other side of the Iron Curtain. 

 Western Europe has enjoyed a solid 50 year headstart in liberty, progress and understanding of a new more inter-connected capitalist world , and because of that, we understood the new era we wanted to embark on, of 'live and let live.' Eastern Europe however had collaborated with the Nazis in killing many of those Jews, and then had partaken actively in aiding Stalin to destroy and liquidate the democracy of all of their republics in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Poland after WWII. Even now, these countries are littered with fascists and communists who are miles apart from our own basic understanding of Western European values. 

 You can see the exact same problem even in Germany. West Germany considers itself more prosperous, open minded and liberal than East Germany...and is in many respects. The East Germans on the other hand openly sympathise with communism and are less tolerant as a whole. I would say though significant investment by West Germany into the East has improved the situation somewhat, the rift is still visible for many Germans today...those of us who lived on the side of freedom in West Europe understand how precious liberty is and human life. Eastern Europeans were unfortunately brainwashed by the Soviets into a lack of respect for human life and tolerance overall.

474,"&gt;If government isn't supposed to be ""looking in people's bedrooms"" then why should it keep track of pairs of people who are probably having sex?

Because marriage is thought to be much more than sex, it's a long term relation planned to last indefinitely where people not just have sex, but have a wholesome relationship as human beings.

Sure, they probably have sex, but also parents probably have sex. Should we abolish the legal concept of parents, biological parents because that's a way for government to keep track of people who are probably having sex?

And in general governments have all sorts of classes for different life situations.

There are legal definitions on what it is to be a parent, to be a child, to be a minor, to be unemployed, to be a veteran, to be retired, to be a sibling and so on. Should all of these be abolished so that the law no longer differentiates between marriages and people just in relationships, minors and adults, who is the parent and child of who and so on?

Because humans naturally form certain kind of relationships and have certain kind of life situations, it is only wise for the government to offer a ""standard pack"" for these people that offers special rights and duties to people in these situations. For example if you are under a certain age, you have greater protection from sexual approaches. If you are a child, you have greater right to inheritance from your parent, if you are a student, you have greater right to discounts and benefits and so on.",,/r/europe/comments/7js4jf/timeline_of_samesex_partnership_rights_in_europe/dr9fan2/,Toby_Forrester,1513289967

499,"""Agendas change over the years, names too. That they choose to name themselves Macedonians now, does not delete all the history they had before.""
That is true. The problem is how they were changed. It does not appear that you are as well educated on the sbject as you should be but let me explain. The Macedonian nation is an artificially created nation. An artificially created language that has been purposefully edited in such a way that it is as different to bulgarian as it could be. The idea of a macedonian nation was first proposed by serbian intelectuals however the biggest problm was that the Communist international adopted it as a project that had to be developed. Now 1944 comes and the Soviet army overruns Bulgaria with all the ""benefits"" of raped women, murders of innocent civillians, stolen properties like agricultural machines and stolen personal property like normal shoes( not even kidding a neighbour of mine had his shoes stolen while two russians had held him at gunpoint).
The Bulgarian communist party is instructed by Stalin to give the mountain of Pirin and Macedonia to Yugoslavia and they obide however during the relations between Tito and Stalin broke down so Bulgaria managed to hild Pirin. 
After Macedonia was given to Yugoslavia the macedonian language was created and everyone was forced to write in the administrational documents that they were macedonians. The ones who refused if they were children were publicly shamed in front of their classmates and many many adults dissapeared. 
I will give you an example. A famous bulgarian writer called Dimitar Talev refused to call himself macedonian so he was send to a labour camp. If you do not believe me check his biograpy. After he got released he always signed all his works as: ""Dimitar Talev the bulgarian"". 
The Macedonian nation is an artificial one. What we bulgarians want is that the truth is simply revealed. WE do not care if they will have their own country. After all the bulgarian national ideal during the world wars was to liberate from discrimination. Macedonians now are nt discriminated, they are free. This is what counts. However as bulgarians we cannot accept that someone steals our history and undermines our identity and we are going to stand up for it.

578,"Actually one reason for why the state is part of the 'marriage agreement' is that it defines the relation of those people to be that of close relatives rather than strangers in legal contexts. In fact marriage generally gives greater right than close relatives.

For example, marriage gives people right in regards of immigration status, inheritance, right of attorney in some occasions and various other miscellaneous rights. For example, if the police show up at your house and the house legally is owned by your spouse, marriage gives you the right to be there and thus the police won't detain you if they find you suspicious as long as you're able to prove your identity. If this were a simple private agreement, you'd have to carry around a legal document that the police would then have to somehow confirm the legality with a notary or the other party or something?

Well, anyhow, my point is that there are practical reasons why the state is a intermediary in marriage and I do agree that its stupid that the state is using that to pick and choose who can get married to whom and how. On the other hand there needs to be some limitations, like preventing minors from getting married simply by singing on a piece of paper, etc.",Bestonia strikes again!,/r/europe/comments/7js4jf/timeline_of_samesex_partnership_rights_in_europe/dr988ou/,NerdPunkFu,1513282782

I made a mistake when I wrote June 1994 but there was no communication between the genocidaires and France during the genocide. If France would be involved there would have been French catched in Kigali. Nothing linked to France was found in genocidaire's policy documents. If there was a real alliance of France with the genocidiare there would be prooves. You can't find a single person name what hapenned a genocide before France cut its relations with the former Rwanda's regime. 

France intervened at the begging of the genocide with the UNO's missions called *Amaryllis* and then we added more soldiers with the *Op√©ration Turquoise* because the UNO cleary failled. It started lately because it was allowed by the UNO and so French had to wait the bureaucrat. The African Union and the UNO thanked France and claimed the intervention safed hundred of thousand Hutus and dozens of thousand Tutsis. Accusation against France began several years after the genocide, in the 2000's, when French judges tried to sue Kegame, who is the bigger serial killer still in power since he killed millions of Rwanda's refugees and Cogolese people.

No, I expect the government to add to anti-discriminator laws sexual orientation.

But it is not, no one uses that. Not in Europe. Pick better one.

&gt; Or we can even do the opposite: we allow people only to marry the same sex. I assume you wouldn't see a problem with 
it, since everyone would have the same rights and there wouldn't be any discrimination of heterosexuals.

Wether the worse thing is worth it's price is up to the consumers, but you can only compare it to competition, not the same product in the past.

&gt; The GPL is a license that grants you rights from the author to use GPL software as you see fit. It only really puts restrictions on distribution but it uses copyright to do so. Essentially the GPL leverages the same copyright rules that any other (non copyleft.) licensed material are protected by.

I'm not sure what you think we disagree about at this point. Everything I just said about compiling a binary without making available the source applies: this obligation sets in as soon as you're distributing, but not before.

""Copyleft"" isn't called that by accident. It is deemed, by Stallman et al. to be a ""hack"" against copyright itself. Essentially, rather than restrict redistribution, it forces redistribution. Crudely speaking.

&gt; Right, but streaming is still piracy, and a breach of the rules. 

I said that didn't I? What is our disagreement?

&gt; I'm saying that Piracy doesn't require you to upload anything, previously there had been an argument that p2p was problematic because you uploaded and downloaded content, you were essentially distributing

I'm saying there can be no online piracy without there first being an uploader. This is entirely correct.

&gt; Now there is clarity that streaming is both a breach of the rules and defined as piracy..

838,"&gt; What statistics are you referring to?

With statistically I mean ""on average""; I mean that I am more likely to lose on social issues than to gain on them.

&gt; You gain the stability your country enjoys with the countries it most trades with being aligned with it in many ways, the economic freedom of your main trading partners having similar economic rules to you, the freedom to move to a variety of different countries which will have very familiar laws to a Dutch person across the board, the ability to impact the lives of many other people positively by being part of a group voting for laws that you think are for the best

I must say that a lot of this to me is honestly. ""trading your social liberties for money"". As it stands I am very poor for the country I live in but money is not my concern right now but the social liberties that I lack which will only get worse with more social power to the EU.

&gt; and the comfort that you don't need to move to an urban area to be happy and comfortable if you aren't a conservative person.

There are many non-urban areas where I live that have a strong progressive showing.

&gt;  If people didn't benefit from being part of extralocal communities then they would never have formed. Even without taking into account economic benefits, there is plenty of stuff to gain from being part of non-local communities whether they be counties, countries or the European Union.

People are then again very opposed often and often secede from such unions or are unwilling to join them because they don't like others deciding things for them.

Also generally what are race relations and or foreigner relations like in Armenia?. Is racism and or xenophobia commonplace or not?. How are black, mixed race and asians, and whites treated &amp; viewed? Are they a common sight?. And how are foreigners treated &amp; viewed?, Are they a common sight too?)..

Armenia is a small country now, but for most of history it would have been a medium-sized country as far as nations went back then. Like any medium-sized population, there is a lot of variation there. Being where it is, that natural variation is accentuated a lot more because Armenia was at a crossroads situated alongside very different looking kinds of populations (Europeans, Central Asians, Arabians, etc.).

There's no conciousness of racial differences in Armenians. The diversity is a given, and is often celebrated, usually with the maxim that no matter how different an Armenian looks from another, ""you can always tell by their eyes"" (and in a lot of cases by their nose :P). So no, there is no intra-national racism or anything of the kind, but that does exist in neighbouring Turkey (Turks who look more Eastern are often derided as having Kurdish or Arab origins).

There is, however, a lot of racism towards non-Armenians. Muslims and darker-skinned folks get it a lot worse.

The problems are multi-national corporations who know they can sell shittier quality of their products depending on the country. Products look completely identical in Germany vs Czech rep but they are different. Funny thing is that big brands are in germany perceived as sort of low end but in Czech rep it is much more high end so the corporations started to ask premium price for them.

1088,"&gt;Well, in practice we fortunately don't have many examples where this comes into play

And I think it shouldn't come into play for abortion either.

&gt;In case of anti-abortion laws we're also often not speaking about direct infringement on people's right to bodily integrity, but mostly about outlawing it to provide certain drugs and medical services. So it can easily argued that a ban on doctors prescribing abortion pills isn't worse than a ban on doctors prescribing heroin. 

And similar as a ban on painkillers and bandages then, if you're arguing that it's okay to ban specific medical services on principle.

&gt;So the train of argument would only work in passive cases, e.g. when it's about someone refusing prenatal care. But not when it's about taking drugs that kill the cell blob. That would be the equivalent of shooting yourself knowing that the bullet will go through you and kill someone else. 

The difference being that the cell blob has latched onto you, and you can't run away from it - so it reasonably constitutes self-defense.

&gt;Really, to me this argument isn't about outcomes, it's about semantics. I simply think the ""choice"" argument is badly crafted and it should instead be emphasized that a fetus lacks all forms of consciousness and abilities to feel and therefore shouldn't enjoy any of the the rights of an actual person. I guess that would also help with the emotional stress abortions cause to some women who decided to have one. 

I agree, but that's mostly a consequence of the need to have a an argument that would stick to the US legal system. The idea that a cell blob is not a person is a much more solid foundation for the right.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/7j9vxq/i_didnt_know_german_was_that_literal/dr8ez72/,silverionmox,1513246248

1094,"It's a historical relic, really.

Jehovah's Witnesses used consistently refuse both military and non-military service. During the 1960s that meant they were sentenced to a ""special work facility"" located in Karvia in Western Finland. This facility had really shitty conditions and people had to spend an average of two years there, kept in rooms of 6 to 8 people and allowed only an hour outside daily. No proper toilet facilities either so they pretty much had to shit in buckets.

In 1968, a Swedish journalist snuck into the facility and reported on the ""concentration camp like conditions"". Then President Urho Kekkonen, who ruled in a semi-authoritarian way that the constitution of that time made possible, **really** didn't like that kind of negative international publicity it could bring. So President kindly asked the minister responsible to do something about it.

1100,"&gt;Nah, we (my country) has not voted in such lunatics into the EP so I'm not blaming myself. Our EP election have extremely low turnout which sounds bad at the first sight, but ironically it produces relatively reasonable results (compared to the national elections) because only people who have an above-average interest in EU affairs (and thus tend to be more knowledgeable about the EU than on average) vote (well at least it was like this in the last 2 european elections).

As you can see the actions of other Europeans affect you wether you see yourself as one or not. The ""we"" is thereby larger than just the Czech electorate. In many countries, the EP elections are viewed as little more than a means to reward or punish the national government based on national policies, rather than to elect proper representatives.

&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by the electoral reform, I'm personally convinced that no electoral reform can change the fact that our votes will always be kind of lost in the EP due to our size, so it will never be in our hands to elect a more capable EP.

Not until we view the EP as more than a chamber to cow-trade national interest, and as one in which we elect representatives of a European citizenry to discuss European issues. 

In the current system, a party that would have broad support throughout the Union but not deep support within each member state cannot be elected. Those views usually see Europe as a whole, and hence are not as linked to national mainstream thought while more open to ideas from othe member states. 

An example of this is ""latent pro-EU right"" in Western Europe which is in favour of restrictive migration, but which simply has no national party to go to because all national pro-EU parties are centre-left/left while all right parties are anti-EU.

1102,"&gt; I don't feel like that's the intent of any such movement though. I would say the intent is to bring some more positivity into people's lives.

I agree with this. But my point is that the author was like ""How do we bring positivity in female persons' lives? I got it, we tell them they are beautiful!"" it's just such an awkward stereotype that the easiest way to keep a woman happy is to tell her she's beautiful.

&gt; Why do you think people prefer sharing pictures of beautiful/cute things, or heartwarming stories, as opposed to ugly things, or stories about how horrific people can be to one another? Like why is it cat videos shared and not children being blown up in Syria? Surely, one is more important and deserving of your attention than the other.

As I said, I wouldn't have mind if it was just a collection of 500 beautiful things in every which way direction. But by simply calling it ""the atlas of beauty"" and making it all about females it re-enforces the idea that being beautiful is one of the most important things for women and girls.

&gt; So I'm not from a Western country and I've never been to the US where a lot of this stuff originates, but I have the sneaking suspicion that a lot of it is limited to pretty specific places and groups. The internet, as always, is a megaphone.

Well I'm not from the US, as I said my native language has no distinction between masculine/male and man/male.

But that's just how English works universally and always has. That's not isolated to the US. ""male"" denotes an object (possibly biological) marker and man denotes a social marker with an associated set of behaviours.

To put it like this, in the thread of Finnish conscription I was talking about ""making men out of boys""; this is a social thing. If I said ""making adult males out of minor males"" it would make no sense; that just happens the moment you turn 18 but ""making men out of boys"" implies a behavioural change; that's just the difference in English. A male person is male regardless of behavioural traits and what not but people will argue what it constitutes to be ""a real man"" or ""act like a man"". There is no ""acting like a male"".

&gt; I have serious doubts you'd be bringing identity politics into any everyday discussion with someone outside of some liberal arts college campus.

I don't, I take it _out of it_.

Using the term ""man"" or ""woman"" makes it about identity. Using the term ""male"" and ""female"" takes that out of it and keeps it clinical. I prefer to not use terms that are linked to social identities unless that is relevant.

&gt; If anything, people will just be weirded out by the clinical language, so if you're trying to not stand out or be neutral, it doesn't really work, since most people don't care or even think about this identity politics stuff (in spite of what the internet would have you believe) and will just find it peculiar that you speak so clinically about other human beings.

I think most people in everyday life are _constantly_ concerned with social identities. That's why such terms developed. When most people say ""I'm a man"" or ""I'm a woman"" they are absolutely talking in terms of social roles and expectations.  When people on the internet are asking you about your sex they're not asking about a biological property in the same way they would be asking about your blood type; they want to draw inferences about your expected behaviour.",,/r/europe/comments/7jloen/atlas_of_beauty_woman_from_northern_romania/dr8bm5w/,my_honour_demands_it,1513238019

I haven't read this before, but I assume that it is in line with the EU's take on financial services.

The rough outline: It is possible, and the default will be for Brexit to cut off access to London.  This will hurt both the EU and the UK significantly.  It is unlikely to be easy to simply ""transfer"" London into the EU in a zero-sum fashion.  The EU has been moving in the direction of providing ""equivalency"" rulings that would permit countries with comparable regulations to offer banking services in the EU.  If the EU were to do this, the UK's (obviously currently compatible) rules could be simply ruled compatible, and the hit to the EU and UK could be reduced.  Some services would still need to relocate to the EU.

The document also saw UK EEA membership as unlikely and probably not politically-viable in the UK (no surprise: I agree here), but identified it as a favorable approach from the EU's standpoint (no disagreement from me here either: for EU members, having countries in the EEA is a favorable deal) that would not require any relocation..",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7jo0zu/eu_to_uk_youre_not_special/dr899ox/,vokegaf,1513233324

There is a lot of things that need to be understood about conscription.

It could (and propably would) very well be better for Finland's economy. It would on the other hand make the Finnish DF a fair bit smaller and less effective. The defence budget would have to be a lot larger to accomodate the salaries of soldiers if the same ""strength"" would be kept.

Larger defence budget would immediately show on other things; taxes, cuts on other government paid things such as pensions and roads and even schools.

Larger taxes could mean less buying power for the citizens and thus adversely affect the economy again.


This is all speculation from my part since I'm in no way an expert on this matter.

I feel like currently we can't keep the strength of the military and phase out conscription.

So in the current political climate it might be better to lose some in economics than in military strength.

1294,"&gt; So are you taking issue with the name (ie: being pedantic), or with what the book itself is doing?

Both I guess.

I find ""a book of pretty female human beings"" some-what annoying in its own right but to call it ""Atlas of pretty"" is antropocentric and if it were ""atlas of pretty humans"" it's just annoying to only feature females.

&gt; When you went on the whole ""only as good as their looks"" thing, you forgot to mention that this is NOT actually a ""500 Hot Girls from around the world"" album, even a cursory look at the webpage and you'll notice that a lot of them are old and many are perfectly average, normal people. Yes, some of them are also quite attractive, but not all, it's certainly not the focus. Also, there is always a little story attached to each picture.

I actually do not much care about this as much as that I care about that they are all female on purpose.

&gt; So what is it trying to tell us? That there are many different kinds of beauty. When it says beauty, it's not talking strictly about the physical.

That I find even more annoying this ""everyone is beautiful"" movement where people redefine the word ""beautiful"" to be able to fit everyone under it because it kind of elevates ""beauty"" to the single most important thing rather than just saying ""You aren't pretty and that's fine"".

In this case doing it with female persons only in the book re-enforces the idea that being beautiful is the single most important female quality. Telling female persons ""You can be beautiful too when you are old because being beautiful is like all youi care about and the single most important thing for you, right?""

&gt; So if anything, this celebrates women and diversity, rather than conforming to those stereotypes of misogyny that you tried to conjure up.

Don't put words into my mouth via pigeonholing. ""celebrating women"" is not something I am interested in or approve of in the slightest and I really dislike those kinds of things.

&gt; PS: Also, do you have to refer to them as females?

Indeed.

&gt; They are women

Or girls?

&gt; It sounds incredibly sterile when referring to actual people.

That is why I do it. ""Human female"" is an objective descriptor ""woman"" is a social identity label which I don't like. I prefer terms to be clinical and descriptive and free of identity politics and labels.

&gt; but when referring to individuals? Do you actually call someone a female or a male?

When the sex is relevant, yes. Apart from that I prefer to avoid words like ""man"" and ""woman"" and use ""person"" or ""someone"".

My native language does not have a distinction between male/man as a noun and male/masculine as an adjective which is a great miss because it's very convenient that English has it for me.

&gt; It's weird, you just end up sounding like these guys, I don't know if it's an attempt to be polite or what.

Ah yes, the Ferengi, I know them all too well.

I do in general prefer to stick anthropological terms on humans in these kinds of discussions discussing human behaviour. ""man"" and ""woman"" are social groups people place themselves under ""male"" and ""female"" are objective terms third observers place people under. The problem is that you can say ""I fail as a woman."" for failing to live up to some social expectation but ""I fail as a female"" makes no real sense.

answer to some of the questions:
&gt;Are there hostilities or not?
Absolutely not. There is a good amount of diversity in our appearances despite what people may think, but all of us are Armenian in the end. 

&gt;How are black, mixed race and asians, and whites treated &amp; viewed? Are they a common sight?. And how are foreigners treated &amp; viewed?, Are they a common sight too?
In all everyone is viewed fine. Of course blacks or people with very different racial features will get curious stares, but that's natural, Armenia is rather homogeneous country. Except for tourists, very few actual foreigners living in Armenia. 

&gt;What's the level of English speaking like in Areminia?
It's getting better especially with the new generation, that being said, Russian is still the de-facto second language, spoken and understood by great majority. 

&gt;What's the LGBT situation like in Armenia?
Not really accepted by society, and viewed negatively by most. We have conservative society after all. Government recently said though they would accept foreign registered marriages as legal in Armenia as well, even same-sex marriage, which was a surprise.

It reiterates its concern at the fact that the preferential treatment accorded to Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses has not been extended to other groups of conscientious objectors. 
The State party should fully acknowledge the right to conscientious objection and, accordingly, guarantee it both in wartime and in peacetime; it should also end the discrimination inherent in the duration of alternative civilian service and the categories that can benefit from it (arts. 18 and 26 of the Covenant).",Finland,/r/europe/comments/7jidrl/81_of_finns_support_current_conscription_system/dr7z6vr/,comall,1513219438

Every other major NI party are anti-Brexit as they know it would be too disruptive (and maybe they are pro-EU too). I guess the DUP are pro-Brexit because it's the 'British thing to do' even though it's doing crazy things to the union they care dearly for.

Plus Russia didn't threaten Denmark, it simply highlighted the natural fact that if Denmark joins a foreign military alliance, it will of course feature in any Russian targeting. That's what I'm saying: NATO promotes danger, under the guise of security. The US would tell Mexico the same: if you join Russia's alliance, there's a chance we'll attack you. It's a strategic requirement. 

&gt;It's in the EU, but the way EU armies are now it's hard to react fast and act independently from the US. 

That's only right now. Would you be open to an EU army or similar, something which doesn't include the US? I think if the US wasn't in NATO, the alliance wouldn't be seen by Russia to be as bad. 

&gt;If Russia were to make a surprise attack they would be able to push far without problems for a while, if the US wouldn't participate we would have a harder time pushing back, probably waste even more lives. And the Baltic countries are afraid of Russia using tactics like they used in the past like using their minorities as a reason for occupation

Understandable. But there's no logical reason for Russia to do this. You know the deal with Crimea was a special case. I just don't think Russia/Putin are into random aggression. But the thing is, if all countries around it join NATO, they will for example be inclined to blocking Russian gas and other resources. Since Russia' economy is super dependant on these resources, that would force Russia to act. Much like it would force the US to act if Saudi Arabia started trading its oil in euros instead of dollars or stopped sending oil to the US.

1616,"A 55-year-old man, V√≠ctor L√°inez, died this Tuesday at the Hospital Cl√≠nico in Zaragoza due to injuries suffered in the early morning of the 8th, after being assaulted by another 33-year-old man who had allegedly recriminated him for wearing suspenders with the Spanish flag. The alleged aggressor is detained and reportedly linked to ""anti-system movements"". Sources of the National Police Corps reported that the event took place in the area of cups of Heroism Street, in the Aragonese capital, in one of its bars. As the police point out, the investigation remains open, and has also identified an escort. The alleged aggressor, arrested on Monday, who is accused of a homicide crime is Rodrigo Lanza and who allegedly had reprimanded the victim in the aforementioned bar to wear suspenders with the Spanish flag. The detainee, of Chilean origin and a nationalised Spanish citizen, was sentenced to five years in prison for throwing a stone at an agent, whom he left a quadriplegic, during an eviction squat in Barcelona in 2006, according to Efe's knowledgeable sources of the investigation. The events for which he was convicted took place during a fight after a squat party. The assaulted officer was then in a vegetative state, and the Supreme Court sentenced the accused in 2008 to five years' imprisonment. The young man was released after serving two years in prison for a crime for which he pleaded not guilty. On the other hand, it has not yet been possible to identify the three persons accompanying the alleged perpetrator of Friday's aggression in Zaragoza, as they were absent from the scene. The investigation is also awaiting the autopsy result to find out what the victim was hit with. The alleged perpetrator has stated that it was a single punch, but the police are trying to find out whether the assault was with any object. V√≠ctor L√≥pez, a supporter of the Spanish Falange and member of the motorcycling group Templarios de Zaragoza, died of brain death, according to sources from the Government of Aragon. According to Falange in a statement, the murder is motivated by ""discrimination and ideological persecution. This organization has announced that it will present a popular indictment in the courts for this reason.

1720,"&gt;What does this even mean?

It means what it says. GDP and the economy overall doesn't matter if people don't like the way they live and the way the things in their country are going. You can be a San bushman in Botswana and live in a hut with no healthcare in your village and still be happier and more satisfied than a middle class Brit. Your original point was that being part of the EU was economically beneficial for both the UK and the EU, but that doesn't mean much, really. A lot of people in the UK didn't vote on economical grounds, but on the grounds of migration into their already inadequately diverse country and probably some other reasons that I am not aware of. Then again a lot of people justified their anti-EU sentiment by citing some healthcare bullcrap and economic issues, but we know what the actual reasoning of many of those people was. 

&gt;What the hell? Where in heavens name is it even a remotely stated goal of the EU to erase minor cultures?

It will naturally happen if the EU federalize. Is this a strange concept to you? National identity was slowly disappearing during the USSR, and it existed for around 70 years only and the minor states were succumbing to Russian influence, with many attempts of the RSFSR to establish Russian as the official language in satellite republics. 

Also the process of the disappearance of the minor cultures will be sped up by the fact that now that every member state inhabitant has a common EU citizenship, migration from Eastern and Southern EU countries to the economic giants will become even larger. Romania, Bulgary, Hungary and Baltics already have issues because their youth is flying to Germany, France, UK, Netherlands or Belgium and work there and correspondingly boost the economy of those countries, while the Eastern European countries' economies only get weaker and weaker. If the demographic trends in Germany and Netherlands continue, soon or late the regions will be overcrowded and the people will migrate to Eastern Europe, i.e to emptier lands where the economy is weaker and could be significantly improved with the help of a larger population. That would mean that now most of the EU would be getting populated by the most populous ethnic groups in the EU. French, German etc. while Lithuanians, Greeks and others get assimilated.

1751,"&gt; So all KRRiT decisions are bad since its always controlled by the ruling party?

No, but it makes the decision seem politically connected. It's in KRRiT's interest to make their case as clean-cut as possible.

&gt; Trwam or Rydzyks University?

Both - she is a lecturer at Rydzyk's university and has appeared on TV Trwam and Radio Maryja as well.

&gt; And? IF they did what KRRiT said they did, then that is a lot worse and dangerous than the flag in shit ""incident"". If anything I think the 500k was too high for Wojewodzkis idiotic stunt. This could have potentially ended a lot worse.

Given the reasoning they gave, I believe proportions should have been the other way around. ""Desecrating a flag? Meh. Inviting wrong people? Outrageous!""

&gt; not informing the viewers the assembly was discontinued by the police

They informed after they interviewed the spokesperson, who is the authoritative person in that regard and have been informing so ever since. And they also informed about it by airing Mateusz Kijowski's call for everyone to leave, which the report doesn't say when happened and automatically dismisses as a fact because it didn't say ""being in front of parliament is illegal"". Hardly an argument, if you ask me.

&gt; misrepresenting what was happening in front of the parliament building (by manipulating their feed and not correcting presented information that turned out to be false)

If you're referring to an accident with a man lying in front of the car, then this is the timeline:

* 2:48 - TVN24 camera shows the situation for 3 minutes straight. The report does not say if that was broadcasted live or it was recorded earlier. 

* 3:30 - TVN24 reporter interviews the police spokesperson. Despite the fact the report says ""presents the position"" (""przedstawi≈Ç stanowisko"") as if they were waiting for releasing this information, the report quotes a dialogue between them, suggesting it was indeed an interview.

The delay can be explained by the fact this was a live situation, as well as the possibility that many broadcasters wanted to interview the spokesperson. Claims this was somehow manipulative aren't proven well enough in my opinion.

&gt; supporting/popularizing the blocking of the rostrum (which was illegal)

They aired an opinion saying they should stay there, which according to the report constitutes not only support of the action (because they even allowed it to air), but it also encouraged it (by means of, including, giving it airtime). By that train of thought, they should also be accused of supporting radical Islamic terrorism (they aired statements by al-Baghdadi, and they gave him airtime by airing them). This is a ridiculous claim.

This whole report was written with a thesis and it's just visible. All counter-arguments to what the author believed are dismissed as ""not being enough"" or countered with quotes from other commentators, as if they on their own annulled any diversity of thought that was present on air. I find it funny the author said that the journalists hosting discussions on TVN24 should have behaved like a conservative commentator they invited (which is ironic, given they accuse them of bias). I find it funny when the author claims quotes by government MPs were disparaged by journalists... by airing a quote from a former Constitutional Tribunal judge 19 minutes later. 

&gt; TVN appealed the decision and the courts will decide.

Which is of course why literally millions of people from african and middle eastern countries, where healthcare is minimal, violence is rampant and the political situation is a nightmare, are trying to emigrate to the EU. Because they are so happy at home. 

&gt; Your original point was that being part of the EU was economically beneficial for both the UK and the EU, but that doesn't mean much, really.

Actually it does mean a lot. Steady economic growth, which such a relationship helps achieve, and forward progress are beneficial to literally every single person in the EU one way or another. An increase in trade income for governments may allow them to invest more in healthcare, or education, or reduce taxes.

I agree with you here. It's a problem that needs to be adressed by the allocation of more federal funds from 'core' EU countries like the ones you mentioned, to 'periphery' EU countries, like the ones you mentioned.

&gt; That would mean that now most of the EU would be getting populated by the most populous ethnic groups in the EU. French, German etc. while Lithuanians, Greeks and others get assimilated.

1770,"&gt;NATO members urge on this expansion.
 
It shouldn't matter, the countries can just not join like Finland and Austria.

&gt;NATO members didn't reject those members.

But they did wait 10 years for Czechia, Hungary and Poland, 14 years for Estonia, Latvia. Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Romania and Bulgaria.

&gt;NATO is irresponsible, as I said, with the ""it's their choice"" argument, which doesn't take into consideration that their choice further imperils them.

If a country wants to join should the member countries say no just not to anger Russia?

&gt;aka ""red lines"", like with Assad, when they said he used chemical weapons against his population, hypocrtically.

NATO isn't involved in the Syrian conflict.

&gt;Feeling the need to defend against Russia doesn't require joining a foreign military alliance out of hand.

Has Russia done or is planning to do something to give NATO a reason to join like in the past?

&gt;you'll know it's by definition always ""in defence"" when it's the US. They always call their actions defence.

That is the USA's excuse, that doesn't mean the EU needs to buy into it, like how France did for the war in Afghanistan, if the EU united militarily every country could do the same because they wouldn't feel the need to suck up to the US. They would most definitively not join because the US would ""Attack said country.""

&gt;Hence why one shouldn't create the conditions for it.

Is NATO the one that is rising tensions or is it Russia that, because they can't bully their neighbours anymore, is powering up to defeat NATO's defences?

&gt;It's that supposed shields can upset the balance.

But they wouldn't destroy Russia because it's destroying their missiles. Are missiles the only way russia can defend itself?

&gt;Russia is not as militarily powerful as NATO, so there's no need for NATO either.

That doesn't stop them from being dangerous, NATO makes sure there's no chance for Russian aggression.

&gt;Also, militarism is not military. You need to look this up I think.

Russia attacking Ukraine is militarism, you could argue using the Crimean referendum but it'd be like using one of the US' excuses for war, Russia didn't like Ukraine getting so close to the west so they thought this was a good opportunity to take the naval base in Crimea directly under them.

&gt;Lastly, the degree of Russian aggression in the world comes nowhere near the US.

I don't care about the world, I said we should focus our attention on Europe and its neighbours and for me, Russia is the biggest aggressor in Europe.

&gt;But the media would like you to think so and to constantly think that the interests of Eastern European nations are the most important.

Russia is *currently in war with our neighbour*, has threatened member countries with bombing, they've threatened non-member countries not to join NATO, they've simulated attacks on member and non-member countries alike and keeps putting on a show of great military might, or better called militarism.

However, **weighing an object**, finding the volume, then doing the division is to find density.

The story has Archimedes doing it to determine whether something was *really* gold, or whether it had less-precious metals mixed in.

http://www5.csudh.edu/oliver/satcoll/archmede.htm

&gt;Tradition tells us that the king was suspicious about the purity of the gold in his crown and asked Archimedes to find a way to determine if it was the real thing. Solving the problem seemed to be impossible because in those days (3rd century B.C.) nothing was known about chemical analysis. One day Archimedes was thinking about the problem while taking a bath. As he lay floating in the bathtub he thought about his ""weightless"" body. Suddenly he realized that all bodies ""lose"" a little weight when placed in water, and the bigger their volume, the more weight they lose. He realized that the density of a metal can be found from its weight and its weight loss in water. The weight of the King's crown and its apparent loss of weight in water would tell him if it were made out of pure gold. Archimedes shouted ""Eureka!"" (I have found it!) and rushed out into the street naked to announce that he had solved the problem. Today the effect he observed is called Archimedes' Principle.

&gt; ‚Äì Sy√∂ksykierre on oikaistu rytin√§ll√§ ja Suomen talous on k√§√§ntynyt ripe√§√§n kasvuun. Viime vuonna talous kasvoi jo l√§hes kaksi prosenttia. Kasvu oli t√§m√§n vuoden kolmannella vuosinelj√§nneksell√§ 3,6 prosenttia verrattuna edellisvuoden vastaavaan nelj√§nnekseen. Kasvu on nyt L√§nsi-Euroopan nopeinta.

&gt; Sipil√§ mustutti puheessaan, ett√§ velan osuus kansantuotteesta on taittunut ja kokonaisverotus on k√§√§ntynyt laskuun. My√∂s ty√∂llisyydess√§ on tapahtunut k√§√§nne parempaan, vaikka hallitusohjelmaan kirjatun 72 prosentin ty√∂llisyysastetavoitteen toteutuminen vaatii yh√§ lis√§toimia.

When somebody covers your entire cost of doing something, they also get to tell you what exactly they want done and how. For example, if you pay someone to build you a house, you get to tell them what kind of house you want, right? If some construction company said, ""Give us money, and we will build you a house however we want‚Äîno guarantee that you'll like it, though. Also, if we screw it up and the house collapses before we finish, it's also your problem,"" do you think they'd have that many customers?

So if any government decided to cover the entire cost of raising a child, it would certainly come with lots of strings attached. You'd probably have to prove that you'll be a good parent (maybe there would be a eugenics program in place), and your freedom to make decisions for your child as a parent would be severely limited.",,/r/europe/comments/7jhdvm/study_many_childless_finns_see_parenthood_as_an/dr759mp/,BurningFox,1513188333

2032,"Someone in the EU came up with a silly idea of redistributing refugees and immigrants, an impossible idea, yet somehow it got to the top and in confusion someone announced it as a done deal. That's something you can't take back just like that, otherwise the whole organization would look like a bunch of idiots who don't know what they're doing or saying. 

So what happened was that everyone pretended that the quotas are a real thing that is supposed to be happening and enforced while stalling for time until they could finally proclaim this idea as pointless and, in better case scenario, obsolete. That's why literally noone obeyed the quotas, everyone accepted only a couple of immigrants here and there to pretend that the quotas are a thing without making an unnecessary fuss about it, since every EU official wanted the whole thing to die down as quickly and quietly as possible.

That is, everyone except Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary, countries where literally no refugees or immigrants want to go in the first place. They freaked out the loudest and the most pointlessly, keeping the whole silly idea alive and in center of attention for a little bit more. Even to such an extent that the ""fines"" for not accepting the immigration quotas came back from the dead. Slovakia at least pretended to ""submit"" to the quotas while still bitching about it to be still on good terms with the V4 cool kids, so they avoided any hassle from the EU and any illusionary threats about ""fines"".

So what happened was that idiots in the EU came up with a silly idea and pushed it to the idiots in the high offices of the EU who then proclaimed something they couldn't backtrack from, and idiots in Poland, Czech Republic, and Hungary fueled the fire by freaking out without having an actual reason.*

*No refugee or african/middle eastern immigrant wants to go there and would escape the first chance they'd get if they be assigned there by the quotas (which is another reason why the quotas make no sense as they would only create a chaos of immigrants strolling to Germany still even after being assigned to Poland for example.)",Earth,/r/europe/comments/7jhz0x/new_eu_brawl_over_migration_policy/dr6r3lh/,potatolulz,1513173475

For women the hair has to be tied into a knot, it can't be visible under the helmet or else it might get tangled up with all the wood branches (we usually operate in forests).

Yeah but I do ~~because I'm sexually frustrated due to the lack of long-haired persons with a penis~~ because it's a useless sexist standard and if females can have long hair then so should males be able to.

&gt; Inside the base you have to look soldierly and not like a hippie (no offense intended to anyone), it's an external form of discipline you enforce upon a unit (women are still required to have the hair in a knot).

""externe discipline"" this was the verbatim term used by the Supreme Commander of the Airforce here (Droste) who wanted to repeal the rules here that indeed permit one to look like a hippie but the government chained him and told him he had no such authority to do that.

His term was criticized for not making presentation seem like discipline while it's just presentation. It has nothing to do with discipline; it's presentation. Discipline is your work ethic, not how you look ""external discipline"" is a nonsensical word.

&gt; If the soldiers can't even groom themselves up to the standard how can you expect them to follow orders when the shit really hits the fan?

I think this is the most important part, though it's so vague. My opinion is that every single Latvian life matters, since without the 2 millions Latvian citizens - we're just an empty piece of land. Our culture is what exists in us, in our mannerisms. 

Our conscription should not be based on outright combat, it should be about delaying, it should be about guerilla fighting, it should be about inter-cultural communication. It should be an outreach programme by itself so that the ''conscripts'' will be willing and able to help both local and international soldiers that'll be here in Latvia. The conscription programme should not be used to turn our men (and/or women) into order-taking machines, or deadly soldiers - if we've gone so far, then we're already fucked.

2089,"In poorer countries people have more children as a) a means to support the family later on. Who's going to feed you if you're old, childless and poor? And b) because contraception isn't readily available. It's not like those people are concerned with supporting mankind. Having children is as selfish a decsion as not having them. Most of our decisions are selfish anyway.

Also, children are a liability even if you're from a richer country. Single mothers are at a much higher risk of falling into poverty in Germany than childless singles. There are over 700000 children of separated parents for whom the father doesn't provide child support. The state has to step in and pay. If you really want to increase the rate of childbirth, the best way to do so would be to make sure that the law protects parents from unfair treatment by employers. You's raise the minimum wage so people with an average education and income could start a family without constantly being at risk of slipping from the lower middle class to the lower classes. You'd make sure that people who took time off work to raise their kids won't be at a disadvantage when it comes to their pensions and retirement. You'd build more child care facilities or force bigger companies to provide them for their employees. Then people would procreate at a much higher rate. The constant stress and worry about their future - on top of work related stress - is putting them off kids.

2091,"&gt; Jehova's witnesses used to be the only religious group that refused to join the military. In fact, they refuse to hold guns or swear allegiance to any earthly power (at least the ones in Finland are like that.) At one time the only other alternative for their young men was going to jail so they did that and the parliament changed the law because that was discrimination against their religious beliefs. This should by now be updated. Also because they could now do the civil service without violating their faith.

Yes, they should be. Just as females should be conscripted.

But no one is interested in updating these laws in Finland while other countries are.

Netherlands, Norway and Denmark made conscription universal. In fact Netherlands made _suspended_ conscription universal; this has _no_ practical effect. No one has been trained in 30 years but they did it anyway simply because they thought the principle of not sending 17 year old girls a letter with ""You can in theory be called upon; this is extremely unlikely to happen"" was sexist in and of itself.

&gt; Women's exclusion is a thing that has been worked against gradually. First by allowing them to volunteer for the military, now there is talk of making the pre-conscription medical check mandatory regardless of gender (One extra medical checkup for everyone is good for the nation. It's free for the citizens and if any medical problems are discovered then it is better that it is sooner rather than later.) and presumably as people's opinions change this unfair treatment based on gender will be fixed one way or another at some point.

Yes, gradually, Saudi Arabia is also working on female rights gradually. The point is that Finland is way behind of its Nordic compatriots here and is akin to a state like the US in this respect, not a modern North-European state.

&gt; Gender specific attire is similarly a representation of what the society considers appropriate.

No argument here which is why I said it's about instilling that into people.

&gt; In time of war women would also get the short haircut. (It's mainly hygiene and gas mask related issue for a military unit to have short hair and no beard.)

I would have no objection if the standard was sex-neutral and females too were required to cut their hair short. Well I would have a different objection as I think it's excessive to force people to cut of a part of their body though one that grows back for a compulsory thing. If it was an elective job I could see it but I don't think a state can require every citizen to cut of a part of their body like that even when it grows back when it can take many years to do so.

I know people who have ""maximum length"" hair; if they cut it off it would take seven years to get it back where it was. Whatever body alternation the military may require has to be very quick to restore.

But if it was applied to females too it would not be sexist at the least.",,/r/europe/comments/7jidrl/81_of_finns_support_current_conscription_system/dr6rgw9/,my_honour_demands_it,1513173964

There are a thousand other religions that are ""pacifist"" but only _one_ is some-how excluded which is really stupid and if you are just pacifist without a religious reason then you're not excluded too but you can do civil service instead while the Jehova's just get complete exemption, no civil service needed.

Then there's the obvious sexism of requiring males only and on top of that the Finnish armed forces are one of those militaries with sexist attire regulations in particular in the form of haircuts for males being required to be short.

[You're quoting Conan the Barbarian](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082198/quotes):

&gt;Mongol General: Wrong! Conan! What is best in life?
&gt;
&gt; Conan: To crush your enemies. See them driven before you. And to hear the lamentations of their women. 

That version of the quote was a bit sanitized by Hollywood.

The original quote, [of dubious origin but theoretically from Genghis Khan](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan), is:

&gt;The greatest joy for a man is to defeat his enemies, to drive them before him, to take from them all they possess, to see those they love in tears, to ride their horses, and to hold their wives and daughters in his arms.

2163,"Because all those metrics are only about labour and economic participation where Finland scores very high.

Socially there is much to be desired in Finland, the country has pretty extreme gender roles and high levels of domestic violence in a primarily male-&gt;female direction. For instance in the Netherlands and Sweden an interesting thing is that the domestic violence numbers are essentially symmetric with respect to males and females.

Finland is interesting in particular because it's one of the few countries where close to as many females as males suffer homicide. You might think ""hey, equality, that's interesting"" until you realize that the vast majoritry of female homicides are domestic violence in Finland.

2176,"&gt;UN helmets are absolutely ineffective in combating terrorism, they have extremely strict rules of engagement and they're just not militarily equipped to handle Hamas or Hezbollah. Those are not some random Palestinian teenagers armed with a kitchen knife, those are real dangerous relatively well-armed terrorist military groups. Besides that, the UN has an anti-Israel bias, so Israel doesn't trust it.

The point is to reduce the points of direct confrontation to reduce the tension... And effectively, to reduce the number of actual Palestinian teenagers that are shot and the consequent revenge terrorism. It would also mean that a Palestinian state could be demilitarized if that can help to reduce the irrational fear of Israel of being conquered by a poor, devastated and hamstrung state when they beat a much larger coalition earlier.

Israel isn't effective at combating terrorism either. If they were, they wouldn't need a permanent occupation anymore.

&gt;Besides that, the UN has an anti-Israel bias, so Israel doesn't trust it.

Which bias? If Israel stops wiping its feet on a variety of internationally agreed standards. Don't keep burglars in the cellar if you don't want to be seen as the neighbourhood psycho.

&gt;You're making it sound as if Israeli soldiers are simply murdering Palestinian kids on daily bases. 

[Which would not be far from the truth - children only, it's one every two days.](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20170601-report-israel-killed-3000-palestinian-children-since-2000/).

&gt;As if they were executed purely for throwing a stone. This is not happening, the Palestinians were only killed in larger number during open conflicts, such as during the infitadas, or during the Gaza war. During this relative peace, there are only very sporadic victims, and often those people who are killed are killed because they attempted to stab an Israeli with a knife.

It's easy to claim self-defense when the counterparty is dead - it's execution without a trial. Even believing them on their word for every single case ([which we shouldn't](http://mondoweiss.net/2017/03/palestinian-occupation-contradicted/)), then it's still undeniable that their presence provokes that violence, and those deaths provoke revenge. So the sensible thing to do is going home, so they provoke no revenge for avoidable deaths.

&gt;They already run their own education in the areas which are in their control. The results of that is that their schools are full of propaganda about the evil Jews.

They *are* evil, they occupy them with no end in sight. There is no other word for it. It's as if they try to confirm all the evil stereotypes.

&gt;And this shows a huge problem - even if you hand over the Palestinians the authority over everything, even if they suddenly have their own state, the hatred will still be there, the frustration that their lives suck compared to the Israelis who managed to create a highly sucessful society, that's also still gonna be there, the conflicts between the various palestinian political groups will still be there, the extremists will not just go away, even if there's some reasonable moderate alternative to them in Palestine (which there currently isn't), 

Of course they weren't successful. How successful are countries while they are occupied by a foreign power and their borders are blocked? They are perfectly justified at being angy against that foreign power.

You again assume that Palestinians are inherently extremist and that will never change. And that is why you advocate that Israel effectively keeps them in a prison camp forever. You don't see the Palestinians as human, but some kind of inferior race that cannot be left without supervision of a superior people.

&gt;the extremists will torpedo any normalization of relations between Israel and Palestine, the Arab countries in the region will also torpedo it, because for them, it's much more useful when Israel has issues with Palestinians, they have no desire to see this problem solved.

That goes for extremists on both sides, not just on the Palestinian side. Don't pretend the Israelis are saints in this regard.

&gt;Arafat has hardly made any coherent counter-offer.

[citation needed]

&gt;Now you're just full of shit, Israel's neighbours hated Israel ever since its existence, they are not wary of it because of its behaviour towards Palestinians, they simply never wanted Israel to even exist and made everything they could to destroy it.

And Israel is working hard to justify that hatred, apparently. You can't claim the moral high ground if you drop down to their level. For the third time: I fully support their defensive war, but not the continued occupation.

&gt;I described that above. I assume that based on looking at the history of the conflict.

There has never been an independent Palestinian state. It's like assuming Germany would always be nazi so it had to be kept occupied indefinitely after WW2. 

&gt;Well Israel certainly doesn't think so. Who are you to tell them what's best for their own security?

The ones that they expect support from, apparently. At this point, I wouldn't give shit if they were conquered: time for them to be occupied for half a century. Don't worry, we'll give them exactly the amount of support the Palestinians got, which you obviously think is too much already.

&gt;No, we technically don't. As I said, we're not a federation, we're still a group of sovereign countries. I agree that it can be useful to have common positions on certain issues, but it's not absolutely necessary and it's not a legal obligation for the member states.

Then the same goes a fortiori for Czechia and the US and Israel. Clearly your ties with the EU are closer than with those countries.

&gt;If we went completely against the EU in this issue and adopted the same position as Trump, then I agree that it would be problematic, but we're not doing that, we're not blocking any EU declarations on this, we are not vocally protesting any of Mogherini's statements, we're trying our best to not undermine the EU but at the same time be loyal to our alliance with Israel.

The EU's position *is* not to take position to avoid burdening the peace talks with expectations on either side. You went against that.

&gt;Trump brought it up, so it became a relevant topic for this moment and politicians usually make statements and assume positions on topics which are currently relevant. That's why our MFA released its position. It's completely normal and it doesn't mean that we're sucking up to Trump, it just means that we're supporting Israel.

That makes no sense, Israel has been claiming Jerusalem since forever.

&gt;Yeah, but they could renounce terrorism as a method of pushing for their interests and then show by actions that they're really serious about that commitment. That would put a huge pressure on Israel, because a big part of their justification why they need to be in Palestine would go away.

98% of Palestinians already don't commit terrorism, and they still are occupied. There already were periods with low or negligible terrorism, and yet Palestine is still as occupied as ever. Israel doesn't give a shit about moral pressure.

Besides, why should the first step come from the side with almost no power? Israel controls everything, they have the power. They have much more room to make a gesture. Palestinians have nothing to lose.

2206,"No, he was always terrible. *Gladiator* is far from realistic - the Maximums character is based on a person who lived a couple of centuries later, Commodus was probably more inept than his portrayal there and more under control of his sister than the other way around - but it hardly started the idea that Commodus was terrible. Gibbon (*Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire*) basically blamed him for being the main cause that the empire fell.

Commodus was the one who truly trashed the Roman economy. He started the long devaluation of the currency that was a big reason it all fell, and the one thing not even Diocletian managed to fix. This may have been understandable, if it had been done in a time of crisis, but Marcus Aurelius left the empire as strong as it had ever been, and there were no wars. Commodus used the windfall to build monuments to himself, give money to his favorites, and massive gladiatorial games - the movie was right about that. When Rome burned during his reign, he refounded it as ""Commodiana"" and referred to its citizens as ""Commodianus"". He renamed the legions ""Commodianae"", and as mentioned, renamed all the months after himself. Megalomaniac didn't even begin to describe him.

To be fair, he is another of those that was an enemy of the Senate and as such was probably described as even worse than he was, but his economic policy is a matter of historical record, and it was a significant factor in the collapse of the Roman economy.

2229,"&gt;  consortium Airbus

Ben justement, le probl√®me de Dassault est qu'Airbus n'est plus un consortium, mais un groupe int√©gr√©, dont le plus grand actionnaire est l'√©tat fran√ßais, et qui √©tait lui-m√™me important actionnaire de Dassault Aviation jusqu'√† l'ann√©e derni√®re. Du coup, Airbus DS est sensiblement mieux plac√©e que Dassault Aviation pour profiter d'un futur march√© europ√©en de la d√©fense dans lequel les √©tats-membres vont mutualiser de plus en plus leurs achats et donc abandonner progressivement la ""pr√©f√©rence nationale"". Ceci est d'autant plus pr√©occupant pour Dassault que le march√© des avions de combat va √™tre s√©rieusement bouscul√© dans un futur proche par la mont√©e en puissance des drones, exigeant des nouveaux savoirs-faire que Dassault ne ma√Ætrise pas n√©cessairement et ouvrant la porte de ses chasses-gard√©es √† Airbus ou m√™me Thales.

C'est tout-√†-fait vrai que les programmes collaboratifs, en mati√®re de d√©fense, ont √©t√©, jusqu'ici, assez d√©sastreux, mais ceci est surtout d√ª aux exigences de retour industriel des √©tats participants. Ainsi, par exemple, l'Eurofighter a √©t√© s√©v√®rement handicap√© par l'exigence des participants d'avoir chacun une ligne d'assemblage propre. Du coup, le consortium Eurofighter a √©t√© oblig√© de cr√©er des toutes petites lignes d'assemblage en Italie et surtout en Espagne, ce qui en a fait monter le co√ªt, neutralis√© les √©conomies d'√©chelle et en cons√©quence restreint les budgets pour son √©volution cons√©quente. Le d√©veloppement de l'A400M a, quant √† lui, √©t√© retard√© des ann√©es par le refus des √©tats participants, sous pression des motoristes europ√©ens, de l'√©quiper de moteurs canadiens d√©j√† disponibles: du coup des nouveaux moteurs ont d√ª √™tre con√ßus et, m√™me si le r√©sultat final est tout-√†-fait impressionnant, ils en auront bav√© pour y arriver. A cela est venu s'ajouter le fait que la Grande Bretagne a continu√© √† lorgner du c√¥t√© du C-17 am√©ricain, pendant que l'Allemagne √©tait toujours tent√©e par les Antonov ukrainiens. Du coup, le programme n'a continu√© que gr√¢ce √† l'insistance de l'Espagne, pays o√π est situ√©e la ligne d'assemblage, et qui pour cela a pass√© des commandes compl√®tement surdimensionn√©es par rapport √† ses n√©cessit√©s r√©elles, commandes espagnoles qui ont d√ª √™tre s√©v√®rement rabot√©es suite √† la crise √©conomique.

Mais le mod√®le des programmes collaboratifs avec retours industriels garantis pour les √©tats participants est r√©volu: on va de plus en plus vers un mod√®le de simple mutualisation des achats. M√™me si le retour industriel continuera √† jouer un r√¥le, il sera plus similaire √† ce qu'on voit aux Etats-Unis, o√π les grands groupes d'armement, pour s'assurer le soutien de tous les membres du Congr√®s, distribuent savamment leurs usines √† travers toute l'Union. Dassault a donc un choix tr√®s simple: soit s'europ√©aniser, comme Airbus mais aussi Thales, soit jouer sur son pouvoir de lobby pour freiner cette √©volution et rester dans un mod√®le franco-fran√ßais d'armement. Je pense que, pour l'instant son choix est clair, mais je doute qu'il soit soutenable dans le long terme...",European Union,/r/europe/comments/7j9jqk/rarianespace_ariane_flight_va240_galileo_1922/dr6k0en/,Rc72,1513159164

2276,"&gt;The thing is that the pro-choice arguments are incredibly weak if it they don't include the notion that abortion is morally not a big deal.

I don't think so, it's generally considered a lesser evil, taking the relative rights of the involved persons into account

&gt;In most moral and legal systems rights are rarely absolute but generally get weighted against each other to find a balance. In this case that would be the balance between the right to live of the fetus and freedom of health choices of the mother. Given that life generally trumps lesser harm and that a pregnancy is temporary, anyone who sees the fetus even remotely comparable to a human being should logically be in favour of draconian anti-abortion laws. The piano player argument is just nonsense, because in most cases people willingly risk getting pregnant (the number of unwanted pregnancies where there was not at least negligence with using birth control is negligible). 

I don't think the interests of the future child are well served with negligent parents, do you? Anti-abortion activists typically avoid speaking of what comes *after* birth, because it contradicts their idealized picture of what life is.

Life does only trump harm in traditional catholic morality, which glorifies suffering. A more humanist approach gives the choice not to live rather than to live while suffering.

2338,"I didn't answer. Besides all of the issues raised by all the others (especially not mutually exclusive answers, no multiple answers etc.): Not only is the method of polling questionable from a technical point of view (this is not a random poll, and if you poll people outside of /r/europe, you'll skew your poll incredibly. The only way of saving this is by presenting this as a poll on /r/europe and have no one else answer this), but also the questions have been poorly designed: contentwise, as well as by the choice of type of question.

The last two questions are way too open ended; I could go on for hours and hours on both. I'd rather not answer at all (so I don't really think you need my survey), because I know you won't be able to analyse that answer in any significant way, because I've done such questionnaires myself, though in another field. This kind of question seems more appropiate in a qualitative inquiry/research, rather than a quantitative one.

Some of the questions are not even well thought through:

-The first question doesn't even acknowledge Europeans born in one country and living in another. It seems directed at people who are either living in Europe but born outside of it, or who were born inside a European country and never moved outside of it. What about those who were born in Europe, but currently do not live in it? What about those that don't live in Europe, but are part of the European Union? And what about those who have multiple citizenship and consider to be 'from' both of those countries and yet live in another? Sorry, but precisely in a questionnaire *about* identity you could have considered all these possibilities. This is not a survey on soda preference. Either exclude these people expressively (by asking them to not answer, or by discarding the results of people who mark certain choices).

-What is the basis for your choice of age groups? (Why not ask for the age by allowing a numerical answer between 1 and 150) They seem incredibly arbitrary. On top of that, by asking on r/europe you'll probably get 2-3 groups incredibly overrrepresented.

And I'm going to cut it short, as I could keep going on about different questions, but I think you should go back to drawing board, read up on how to design polls and think through what you're asking here. If you just threw some questions together in 20 minutes, but actually knew better, then I don't think this poll should be here at all.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/7jedxf/hi_i_am_an_undergraduate_student_at_tallinna/dr6h8t6/,reaqtion,1513152329

If you tell others that you have depression, anxiety, phobias, etc. they'll just tell you that:

* you need to go out and date more, or that you need to stop thinking about your ex so much

It's okay to complain - often people would rather complain than do anything about what's bothering them - so long you don't get very serious with it, especially if you're a male. I don't know where this culture comes from, but if I had to make an educated guess I'd say it stems from childhood. Almost all of the people I know have had a difficult childhood in some form or the other, either with divorced parents or parents having to work 2 jobs at the time and not giving them too much attention. I've learned how to deal with my own problems and not complain about them to others because there was so much shit around the house at the time that I didn't want to add to the noise with my troubles, so I just lied about everything being okay and kept on doing it because I've grown to expect to solve my own problems by myself and the most I'm willing to trust, confide in and request help from are my other male friends. I've noticed most other men here feel the same, and I've also noticed what a dreadful disconnect I feel with other guys who've had a relatively decent life at home with two parents growing up and everything. When you have to deal with your own problems in life, you learn that exposing yourself to others leaves you vulnerable to the other psychopaths with troubled lives at home who feed off the suffering of others such as yourself.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/7jbm9z/percentage_of_male_population_dying_before_age_65/dr6h9ou/,SangerNegru,1513152387

2371,"It could help, however the Finnish labour market is riggid - there are high minimum wages and not that many low skill jobs. If we can transit people into an education system or job training that could help. However if that cost comes after people have retired the burden becomes even bigger. This is also seen for the youth, around 20% of 19-24 year olds are not employed, in education nor in any kind of job training. You see a small part of this group becomming long term unemployed, and hence falls outside society.

When you add a lesser education, language problems and the huge straints it can take on people to move here. Especially if people come from warzones, split with their families and have other issues. 

If intergration isn't working, that is another problem. From an area close to where I come from we have a lot of Bosnians migrants from the war. The integration was very successful, and employment for instance is high. It depends on how civil society deal with outsiders a lot. We don't really have mass migration in Finland though, the annual numbers of migration are not that big.

Overall increased migration would most likely be a positive effect. Especially for high-skill labour.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/7jbm9z/percentage_of_male_population_dying_before_age_65/dr6hhu6/,Thelastgoodemperor,1513152902

2417,"&gt;why Transylvania did not become independent after the first world war.

Hungary didn't want it independent and the majority of the population wanted nothing to with Hungary. So the only viable option for peace and security was to join the rest of romanians. It was the natural choice.

&gt;there are major historical, cultural and economic differences

Not that major. Besides, the differences were the result of the occupation by different empires. Why embrace the result of occupation, forced assimilation, etc? Why take pride in such things? Today the differences are small.

&gt;it was payback for Romania being on the allied side in WW1

You make it sound like the people of Transylvania were sold by force like cattles to Romania or something. That was not the case. They wanted to join. The split of Austria Hungary after WW1 simply finally made it possible.

&gt;it doesn't necessarily seem like the best solution. 

It really was. A divided Romania would be a far weaker Romania. Everyone would make territorial demands. Hungary still cries for Transylvania although they never had the majority, for example.

2478,"&gt; The problem with this is that gas pipes are kinda unidirectional, so capacity needs to exist for Germany to supply all of Baltics, Poland or Slovakia in the event of a crisis. Our own reverse flow from, IIRC, Slovakia is rather limited.

Then the problem, again, is not NS2 at all, but the limited pipeline capacity from Germany to Eastern Europe. And as such it should be solved by adding new capacity.

&gt; Oh, and don't underestimate Russian ability to lose money when it comes to perceived political gains. They have lost one of their biggest direct customers in Naftogaz and still refuse to budge on price.

Russia can lose some customers, and can negotiate hard against some, but it cannot lose all or nearly all of them. Losing Europe would cripple Russia worse than any economic sanction ever placed on it, the economic crisis it had these years after the sanctions for Crimea would be peanuts compared to that.

&gt; eta: this proposal requires certain goodwill from the provider as opposed to outlined approach that would make an EU agency with a mandate and stuff the single buyer instead of, well, BASF, Shell and GDF.

Certain goodwill that is mandated by the agreement, if the agreement is violated the Commission has the right to inflict fines of up to 10% of global turnover, in some cases without even the right to appeal. 
And you cannot have a single agency that acts as a single buyer, or at least that would be very against the nature of the open and free market. The most direct comparison would be with the oil market, and that market too doesn't have a single buyer (and shouldn't).

&gt; And I don't see how it helps EU energy security (rather than German and French security) in any way since the flows are going to be diverted rather than expanded.

No pipeline is closing or is being shut down because of the doubling of NS2, so there is no diversion, but expansion of capacity. As for the flow, that depends on the market. If there's demand, then the flow will not only be diverted, but expanded too. What you should ask for is an expansion of the capacity from Germany to Eastern Europe, that, in conjunction with NS2, would increase energy security in the entire EU.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/7jarf2/italy_declares_state_of_emergency_after_deadly/dr6efpj/,Etain05,1513146649

2482,"&gt;However genocide is the equivalent of a person being intentionally killed (genocide is the killing of a nation). The analogy ends there. This is independent of whether it is ruled that the person who was killed was a victim or not - consider how some jurisdictions have a more aggressive stance against self-defence whilst others are more lenient yet the outcome is the same in all cases - a person was *intentionally* killed. In the case of genocide legally there is no ""self-defence"" possible for killing a nation.  

So i can't order citizens who harm country to ""clear the place so we can defeat the enemy (they won't be able to win against Russia)"" is considered as genocide ? May i ask you (as a half Albanian) did you ever seen Albanians or any other Balkan people got hurt by OE ? Why only Eastern Anatƒ±olia (still) has problems ? Maybe you should look at from both sides, not just Armenian side, we have been also hurted and when we order **moving not killing** of Armenians because of this we are the guilty ones because OE wasn't be able to transport people normally. If OE was intended to genocide, they would not move people but directly kill them.  

&gt;It is ""moving them out towards a desert and let them get raped, massacred, die of hunger in the way, etc..."". The official rhetoric is that the ""marches in desert, rapes, massacres, deaths because of hunger, stealing children and women"" was because of incapacity of the government but the government had to push through anyway.  

Target is Syria ? Which has deserts, OE send also their army with them wnich means they were also in *death march*. Hello, there weren't trucks or roads which you can use and train was too fad away.  

&gt;Well, this excuse doesnt work under genocide law today. That means if Turkey decided to move all Kurds towards the Syrian dessert and many die, the UN Convention on Genocide would get triggered to act, independently of any excuses such as ""inadequate handling of the situation, etc"". It is the state's responsibility to cater for its citizens and protect them and not to put then in harms way, especially if it is a minority group. When this is done intentionally to a whole group so that he group risks being destroyed as that group, it is genocide.  

If Turkey had Syrian land (we are making an assumption about your topic) and if Turkey was in war with Russia and if Kurds are hurting civillians (PKK does) finally if Turkay decides to move Kurds to Syria than they will also fail probably,  

-Wars are dangerous then before  

-Russia is still way powerful then Turkey  

-Kurds (who are about 15-20 million) would create a way bigger danger then Armenians (who were 1.2 million at their peak time in Eastern Anatolia as wikipedia says).  

&gt;Depends what is ""crushing"". War and civil war is not genocide. There is no intent to destroy a nation to achieve whatever the objectives are.  

Armenians were in a war against OE !? They were joining Russian army, hurting civillians etc. Wth man ?  

&gt;Was there an intent to destroy the Cypriot nation, as the Cypriot nation, in order to capture Cyprus?  

Killing Turkish Cypriots isn't considered as a crime ? Well we are done talking.  

You are either racist or anti-islamic (because most of the Turks, not me, claims they ari muslim).  

&gt;That is another question. However destroying a minority is not the answer.  

If Hrant Dink were able to tell stories about Armenians in Anatolia (as a side note Hrant Dinm was killed unfortunately) then they aren't destroyed.  

&gt;But as I explained before they knew they were killing them by these acts and they still kept on going forward killing them. This shows the killings were intentional.  

If they didn't ordered moving them out, Armenians and Russians would kill Turks ? OE was in war against Russia.  

You can say ""war and civil war isn't genocide"" but you can't say ""Russia and Armenians were in a war against Ottomans but since they are Turks they made genocide"".

I'm in favour of making students age 16/17 who DO want to vote take a short course or something, just some crap that takes at least an hour of their time. Done, you've filtered out the people who care enough to vote intelligently from the people who don't give a shit. Then at 18, everyone can vote regardless of that requirement.

I think that having people vote at a younger age might boost voter turnout. At that age they will learn *why* voting is important, and they might carry this idea with them for life.

I disagree heavily here. Group projects taught me why I shouldn't work together with random people. Group projects at school aren't even close to what actual cooperation looks like, because many of the members aren't really invested in the project. They just want it to be over with and that's it. In real group projects there are incentives for people to work together and penalties if somebody refuses to do work.

It is clear by the wording of the rule that it just refers to settlable islands, to the exclusion of simple rocks. It does not set a threshold of economic activity.

The fact that Turkey won't participate in arbitration is not an argument against the validity of the Greek claim though.

&gt; I also make the argument that UNCLOS aside, Greece's claim is simply not equitable, it's just the rational conclusion.

You are probably correct. I mean the royal family doesn't really add much for tourists. It's not like you can go to the Buckingham palace and see the Queen. Tourists go there anyway and the biggest attraction are actually the guards, which are pretty much just there for show already. Like, if the entire royal family died in a plane crash tomorrow but they kept it a secret nothing really would change. And most tourists come to London but the Buckingham palace is the only attraction that is directly related to the royal family and I even though many tourist go see it I doubt that it is a major factor for why they go to London. I never heard anyone say ""I want to go to London because I really want to see the Buckingham palace"". Actually most of the people that visited me in London where actually disappointed.

- frustration
- alcohol
- stress (larger there due to low wages bureacracy)
- suicide (the suicide rates for the East are stagerring)
- macho culture mentioned. I know some disagree, but it is a different type of macho culture than in Italy. Look at the map recently posted here about how many men in each country prefer the traditional model, with women doing house work and not working. Poland had like 70 percent. The thing is that women see it differently and they work, are often better at the jobs and sometimes earn more than their husbands. I‚Äôve seen what that does to some Polish men.

Mind you those Armenians were forced to move there following the genocide, and only got involved in the war after the Georgian army started looting their villages.

2975,"I will shortly sum up the Abkhazian war and the Armenian involvement. 

Apsuas (today called Abkhazians, which is inaccurate) joined the Democratic Republic of Georgia in 1918 by their own will as they wanted to be defended from the turbulence in Russia and the Sochi area was often under attack from different revolutionary or monarchist factions. Upon joining, the region became relatively peaceful and Abkhazia was granted autonomy. During this time the modern borders of Abkhazia appeared for the first time. Prior to that, during all of medieval times Abkhazia was under some Georgian principality or kingdom, ruled by many Georganised Circassian nobles or the Bagrationi dynasty. 

In 1921, after being conquered by the Russian SFSR, Abkhazia was separated as a different SSR until 1931 when it became an autonomous region under the Georgian SSR. Ethnic Georgians became the plurality in Abkhazia during 1920s, as many Georgians were resettled to Abkhazia by Soviet authorities to work in the sovkhoz and kolkhoz. Apsuas rioted multiple times after 1931 and demanded to regain the status of an SSR but were denied. 

In the late 80s, Georgians were around 45% of the population of Abkhazia and formed the plurality, while Apsuas were 17%. Others were primarily Armenians, Ukrainians, Russians and Greeks. During this time the Soviet grip weakened and Apsua nationalism has started to manifest itself once again. They were also pro-Bolshevik and Georgians were sometimes viewed as colonists of Abkhazia, which makes sense but Georgians did not migrate there purposefully and they were ordinary farmers, not some evil conquistadors. 

Many Georgians in Sokhumi gathered and demanded independence from the USSR, but they were attacked by Apsua counter-protestors and a few Georgian students died. This caused an uproar in Georgia, and the Apsua didn't calm down either. There were sometimes raids of Georgian schools and often clashes with Georgian protesters. As the USSR dissolved the Georgian government decided to enter an army into Abkhazia to quell the unrest and the insurgency began. 

Now to the Armenians. Armenians were initially not involved on a major scale, though there definitely were pro-Apsua and pro-Georgian Armenians, but Armenians en masse started to fight on Apsuan side after Georgians were accused of raiding an Armenian village of Labra and torturing a couple. Even if this is true, claiming that Georgians were anywhere near as cruel as Apsuas would be absolute bullcrap. What also leads one to doubt the veracity of that being why Armenians joined is because the Apsua did in fact kill Armenians before and after that. A significant event is the killing of an Armenian poltician Sumbat Saakian by the Apsua. A possible reason might be religious grounds, as most Abkhazian Armenians are Hamshen and therefore Sunni, but there might have been other reasons. Now I don't claim that Georgians didn't do anything bad because the army was disorganized and insubordinance to commands would be inevitable. A lot of Georgians were quickly trained volunteers. That, however, doesn't mean that Georgians were even remotely close to Apsuas in regards to cruelty and the Apsua didn't target just Georgians either.

That's what the French did, it's been more successful than other policies. 

Getting to 2.1 is possible though. Once you reach a certain state of wealth you come at a point where culture and society have a bigger impact on fertility than the base things (because they become stable) like child deaths and female education.

I think having women being able and allowed not to have children (by which I mean socially, not by law) is a good thing because it makes having children a more thoughtful choice instead of being railroaded into it out of pressure (economical or cultural). However, I cringe when I read people saying ""Do we really want to put a child in such a cruel world?"" stuff, by that logic fertility should've been zero in certain older ages.",Flanders,/r/europe/comments/7jaaon/czech_population_rises_in_first_nine_months_of/dr58uda/,Gerrit8500,1513101345

Firstly, there was literally never was a ""Greece"" in antiquity, or pretty much any other period before the modern age. Not a state, or a confederation, or anything. 

Secondly, Ancient Greek colonies weren't the modern kind of colonies. They were never even claimed by their mother cities. Sure sometimes Greek city states helped one another but other than some loose alliances there was still never a ""claim"" to Greek colonies from cities in the Greek mainland.

Thirdly, nobody is arguing for every country to extend its borders. And nobody is making the argument that FYR Macedonia, a ""literally who"" tier country can seriously challenged Greek territory. The problem with the name Macedonia is A) It's laughably sad how made up and historically inaccurate it is, B) Nation building is fine but when you have a sizable Albanian minority and you leave them out of it, in the modern age, it's certainly not fine. 

And lastly, modern Greece isn't even officially called ""Greece"". Yes you're literally **this level or wrong**. it's called the Hellenic Republic named not for some Ancient reenactment bullshit but from Modern Hellenic-speaking peoples who fought and won their independence in the 1820s.

For one thing these are loans to national governments, not free-of-charge building of infrastructure or factories as some people think. Yes, I know investments are often loans but I'm saying this because many people talking about the Chinese ones act like they aren't.    

Secondly, and more importantly, in exchange for funding the Chinese demand that the project is executed by a Chinese company employing Chinese workers. So  in essence China gets their money back twice - once when they're paid for the work and a second time when the loan is payed off.    

This is naturally very lucrative for China but not so much for the country being ""invested in"". They do get some infrastructure which is nice but if they built it themselves it would end up much cheaper.    

Another thing to consider is that when someone else provides a loan they usually do it for a profitable project, otherwise they wouldn't get their money back.

Secondly, I don't think that Norway, a country that relies so much on fishing and is so caring with what they do, should join the EU because overfishing is definitely an issue I bitch about the EU constantly.

Most Irish people were okay with Parnell's proposal for Home Rule; indeed, the IRA (in the RoI) saw themselves as a ""vanguard party"" attempting to instill separatist sentiment where none existed, and not as representatives of the people.

b) Ireland did not instantly receive independence, but step by step, with de Valera's government slowly modifying the Irish Free State's - still a dominion of the United Kingdom - constitution to form the Republic of Ireland. Most of the country, again, backed the pro-Treaty side of the government, and even Sinn F√©in had pro-Treaty forces splinter off into Fianna F√°il. 

c) Provided equivalent democratic representation, a federal central government, and the ability to call for secession, I don't personally think it would have mattered much either way without the benefit of hindsight, which tells me that Ireland would not have been as well off as part of the United Kingdom, so it was a happy decision anyway.",,/r/europe/comments/7j5him/corsican_nationalists_got_65_in_the_recent/dr51alj/,vin-ivar,1513094068

Oh what a surprise. A Sunni Armenian from Sukhumi claiming that Georgians were the aggressors? What a novelty!

If the Abkhaz valued and respected Armenians so damn much, can you please explain why they killed a defenceless Sumbat Saakian? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumbat_Saakian

Or then why were there hundreds of Armenians in the Georgian Armed Forces fighting for Georgia? Why was there no systematic desertion of Armenians in the Georgian army? Makes you think, doesn't it?

Oh yeah, Georgians defending themselves is a true act of terrorism. Teach your kid to turn around and bend over when he gets slapped in the face if that is your moral perspective. Gladly most Georgians don't agree that you should just watch your compatriots get killed and pillaged. 

It is weird how aggressive those Georgians can be, right? I mean, fighting those who burnt your house down and killed your relatives is just intolerable, uncivilized and entirely unjustified.

Davis says: 
&gt;Pleasure, as ever, to speak to my friend @guyverhofstadt - we both agreed on the importance of the Joint Report. Let's work together to get it converted into legal text as soon as possible. 1/2

&gt;I look forward to working closely with the EP in the next phase, including on a top shared priority: ensuring admin procedures for citizens are as streamlined as possible in both the UK and EU. 2/2 

This is just repeating what is already in the EU's negotiating guidelines and indeed in the Joint Report itself.

[Draft guidance from the 8th](https://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-08-08-37_01.pdf)

&gt;It calls on the Union negotiator and the United Kingdom to complete the work on the issues pertaining to the first phase, to consolidate the results obtained so far and to start drafting the relevant parts of the Withdrawal Agreement. It underlines that negotiations in the second phase can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken during the first phase are respected in full and translated faithfully in legal terms as quickly as possible.

[Joint Report](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/joint_report.pdf)

&gt;Under   the   caveat   that   nothing   is   agreed   until   everything   is   agreed,   the   joint  commitments  set  out  below  in  this  joint  report  shall  be  reflected  in  the  Withdrawal  Agreement  in  full  detail.

In other words, the next step in the Article 50 process is to take the Joint Report, covert it to legalese and put it into a draft Withdrawal Agreement. This has always been the next step, long before Davis said anything.

If negotiations break down and we leave without a deal, however, then the Joint Report is just as non-binding as before.",,/r/europe/comments/7jahjp/david_davis_has_damaged_trust_in_uk_says/dr51t25/,GlimmervoidG,1513094595

3187,"&gt; A judge from Spain's Supreme Court, Pablo Llarena, has ordered the Civil Guard to investigate the ""Strategic Committee"" for independence which included deputies and party leaders like Marta Rovira from ERC (Catalan Republican Left), Artur Mas and Marta Pascal from PDeCAT (Catalan European Democratic Party), Anna Gabriel and Mireia Boya from CUP (Popular Unity Candidacy). The ""Strategic Committee"" also included ""independence representatives of social prestige"" and the investigation could result in a large-scale case with a hundred facing charges. The Enfocats document Llarena is basing the investigation on covers the so-called ""Supreme Command"" of the independence process, formed by individuals, the majority of whom are not politicians, considered ""influencers close to the process"".

&gt; Supreme Court sources tell El Nacional that the judge is just starting the investigation and that, at this point, he wants to know ""the roles of other people"" who appear in different documents the court has seen. One of these documents is ""Enfocats"", a strategic plan to move forward the independence process which, although it includes no names, does list the job titles of those who would have formed the transition government.

&gt; Llarena's move follows the public prosecutors' office last week sending the two prosecutors in the case to Barcelona. There they inspected the documents and material held by different courts in the city which could be relevant to the Supreme Court's investigation.

&gt; Specifically, the judge asks the judicial police involved in the case to carry out pending procedures to clarify and justify ""if there was a potential initial agreement between the political parties CDC [Convergence] and ERC and the associations ANC [Catalan National Assembly] and √ímnium, as well as the Association of Municipalities for Independence (AMI) and which could have been aimed at sharing a strategy to achieve the independence of Catalonia"". In the same way, the judge asks whether some of these entities funded some of the actions agreed by some of the political parties.

&gt; The judge wants the Civil Guard to ask for ""objective evidence which might exist which indicate that these political parties and associations or any of their main members motivated, supported or learned of, without later changing their plans, the social mobilisations which were carried out as a tool to achieve or facilitate the declaration of independence"".

&gt; Llarena also calls for the Civil Guard to provide an individual, sequential report on the different ""acts of aggression and damage, as well as of serious resistance and intimidation suffered in Catalonia during the secessionist process"". They are to mainly focus on 20th and 21st September, 1st October, 3rd October and 8th November, to clarify the participation of each of those under investigation.

&gt; He also wants a report on the specific actions carried out by the ""Committees for Defence of the Referendum"" and the ""Committees for Defence of the Republic"" and their leaders.

&gt; Looking for misuse of funds and disobedience
In the same order, the judge asks for another report on the public funds which were available for administrative initiatives which were overturned or prohibited by the Constitutional Court, like civil campaigns, design and broadcasting of promotional videos, printing posters or ballot slips and distributing them, buying ballot boxes, registering Catalans abroad, etc.

&gt; Finally, he asks the Civil Guard to look into the orders given by the Catalan Interior Minister, Joaquim Forn, in relation to the courts' bans on the facts under investigation or on their non-existence. Forn is one of the two ministers, together with vice-president Junqueras, who the judge refused to offer bail last Monday, unlike their imprisoned colleagues.

&gt; Llarena also asks Barcelona's court of instruction number 13 for details of different interventions carried out in relation to the independence process and which could be of interest for the special case investigating members of the Board of the Catalan Parliament, the ministers and the representatives of ANC and √ímnium for the crimes of rebellion, sedition, malfeasance and misuse of public funds.

&gt; Enfocats, source of future charges
&gt; Enfocats is a document which the Civil Guard found at the house of the general secretary of the Catalan Economy ministry, Josep Maria Jov√©, during the searches on 20th September. The Civil Guard places a lot of importance on the report because ""it reflects the existence of a group of individuals who defined how and when to carry out each of the actions of the [independence] process and, consequently, of the violence and tumult"".

&gt; A fortnight ago it emerged that the Civil Guard had presented a number of reports to the National Audience, when the case was still with that court, which indicated the possibility of Marta Rovira, ERC's secretary general, eventually being charged. That report placed special emphasis on the Enfocats document. Although Rovira's name doesn't explicitly appear in Enfocats, her current job title does as one of those responsible for forming a transition government to move towards the republic.

&gt; At that time, the new judge from the Supreme Court hadn't looked at anything yet, and his priority was to resolve the appeals from the imprisoned ministers. Once that was done, and the decision had been taken to leave vice-president Oriol Junqueras, interior minister Joaquim Forn and Jordi S√†nchez and Jordi Cuixart in prison, the investigation could start.

&gt; The first step has been to ask the Civil Guard to undertake these different investigations, including the one which directly affects Rovira and other officials. Enfocats doesn't include names, but it does list the jobs of those who were to form the transition government, including the parties' general secretaries. The government that never came to be is defined on page 40.

&gt; Who formed the ""Strategic Committee""?
The president and vice-president of Catalonia, presidents and spokespeople of the pro-independence parliamentary parties, presidents and vice-presidents of the pro-independence organisations ANC, √ímnium and AMI, representatives of other pro-independence entities, directors of the offices for the development of self-governance, presidents and general secretaries of pro-independence political parties and independence representatives with social prestige.",Catalan Republic,/r/europe/comments/7jbnif/spains_supreme_court_widens_its_investigation_to/dr51xhg/,LiechtensteinerTandy,1513094723

Its non-Muslim and non-Turkish inhabitants should either be forcibly islamized, or otherwise they ought to be destroyed. These gentlemen believe that the time is propitious for the realization of this plan. The first item on this agenda concerns the liquidation of the Armenians. Ittihad will dangle before the Allies a specter of an alleged revolution prepared by the Armenian Dashnak party. Moreover, local incidents of social unrest and acts of Armenian self-defense will deliberately be provoked and inflated and will be used as pretexts to effect the deportations. Once en route, however, the convoys will be attacked and exterminated by Kurdish and Turkish brigands, and in part by gendarmes, who will be instigated for that purpose by Ittihad."" - Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter, German vice consul",,/r/europe/comments/7j6pre/what_do_you_know_about_armenia/dr4v39u/,HakobG,1513086895

3243,"&gt; The reason this is a bad argument is because something is not illegal, does not equate to is good to do so. Because the government can make up laws to justify its actions.

Ok, so if its legal, who gets to decide if its good or not? ""Elites"" in Brussels that barely know what is going on in Poland?

&gt; Google ""Erm√§chtigungsgesetz"".

What are you talking about? From wiki: 

""The Enabling Act (German: Erm√§chtigungsgesetz) was a 1933 Weimar Constitution amendment that gave the German Cabinet ‚Äì in effect, Chancellor Adolf Hitler ‚Äì the power to enact laws without the involvement of the Reichstag.  (...) The Enabling Act gave Hitler plenary powers. It followed on the heels of the Reichstag Fire Decree, which abolished most civil liberties and transferred state powers to the Reich government. The combined effect of the two laws was to transform Hitler's government into a legal dictatorship.""

How are they in any way comparable? Thats ridiculous, thats just a step away from saying Kaczynski is literally Hitler...

&gt; What does that have to do with anything? We're talking about what the government does right now.

I think its a perfect example of the true motives behind all this criticism coming from the EU and media. To be clear, this doesnt excuse other bad actions, but it shows that a lot of bad shit went on earlier and no one cared. Suddenly, when a party like PiS got to power, things that were previously ""normal"" and widely accepted are evil and unacceptable. All of this ""concern"" is purely political, it reeks of hypocrisy and double standards.

In this specific case the judges even asked the government how a negative decision (meaning the law is unconstitutional and will be reversed) would effect the economy. That should not play ANY role in their decision. 

&gt; I'm still waiting for an answer what about the article is false. All I got now is

Well, it starts off great by linking to another of their [articles](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/11/28/polands-in-crisis-again-here-are-3-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-law-and-justice-partys-attempt-to-take-over-the-courts/?utm_term=.35956e97faac) that is full of bs.
Im not going to go through that article step by step like I usually do, but the very beginning just shows its level of ""journalism"":

&gt; Since taking control of both the presidency and the parliament in November 2015, Poland‚Äôs far-right Law and Justice (PiS) party has swiftly changed the rules for public media, the secret service, education, and the military. In doing so, according to news outlets and human rights groups, PiS has consistently undermined principles of the rule of law and of the European Union, and is heading toward authoritarianism.

* PiS is not far-right. If you disagree, in what way are they, which definition are you using?

* What exactly did PiS do to public media, secret service, education and military that 
""undermined principles of the rule of law and of the European Union""? Of course the article doesnt say anything more about this, just hope people blindly accept everything. 

Now, back to the original article you asked about. 

&gt; has struck major blows against judicial independence

While that is true, the judicial independence needs to be ""reduced"". Up until now judges only answered to themselves, they were untouchable, this lead to many different problems.  I personally do not like PiS judicial reforms and do not support it, but that does not mean that judges should stay as independent as they were. 

&gt;  and independent media. 

&gt; The second strike came Monday, when a government-controlled media authority leveled a $420,000 fine on the country‚Äôs most important independent news broadcaster.

Not even going to go into the ""most important independent news"" part, but they got a fine, so what? They can do whatever they want without consequences or else they are being attacked? This isnt the first time media are crying how they are being ""oppressed"" by the government: for example the government stopped ordering the newspaper ""Gazeta Wyborcza"" - you should have heard the out cries of horror then.

&gt; Its offense was covering a protest demonstration earlier this year. 

Lie. Their offense was HOW they covered the protest. In the same way media said people were arrested for counter protesting the Independence March. The issue was HOW they counter protested (trying to illegally stop a registered march) not counter protesting itself. That is a huge difference. 

&gt; That follows a dubious $30 million tax bill the television channel, TVN24, was handed in July. 

Right away picking a side, what happened to objective journalism? AFAIK this case is still going on (TVN24 is fighting this decision), the courts have not made a decision but the ""journalists"" already know it wasnt fair and it was a ""blow"" against the media.

&gt; But Law and Justice leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, following a playbook pioneered by Vladi¬≠mir Putin, appears intent on forcing TVN24 to adopt a pro-government line, or else be sold or shut down.

Empty statements - absolutely no proof of this.

Its non-Muslim and non-Turkish inhabitants should either be forcibly islamized, or otherwise they ought to be destroyed. These gentlemen believe that the time is propitious for the realization of this plan. The first item on this agenda concerns the liquidation of the Armenians. Ittihad will dangle before the Allies a specter of an alleged revolution prepared by the Armenian Dashnak party. Moreover, local incidents of social unrest and acts of Armenian self-defense will deliberately be provoked and inflated and will be used as pretexts to effect the deportations. Once en route, however, the convoys will be attacked and exterminated by Kurdish and Turkish brigands, and in part by gendarmes, who will be instigated for that purpose by Ittihad."" - Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter, German vice consul",,/r/europe/comments/7j6pre/what_do_you_know_about_armenia/dr4v9y6/,HakobG,1513087148

3328,"&gt; But doesn't the word genocide mean ""mass killing meant to destroy a race or ethnicity"".

Not really. Genocide means intentional destruction, in whole, or in part of a group (a nation in this case) and as such genocide is not about mass killings. For example a genocide can be committed without shedding any blood (by *Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group* or *Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.* - [Article II (e) and (d) respectively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_Convention#Definition_of_genocide)).

&gt; The armenian genocide was an attempt to supress uprisings.

The *motives* to commit genocide have no relevance to whether the *committed acts* are a genocide or not. What matter is the *intent* to *commit acts* which destroy a nation (in this case), in whole or in part.

3332,"&gt;That's not the EU integration process but US President Trump who thinks that NATO is obsolete.

Trump will be in office for between 4-8 years (lets hope for the former..) NATO, the relationship that the US has with various EU states and all the rest of it has been around for a lot longer and will be around once he has gone.  A huge amount of time and effort has gone into creating a very capable alliance in NATO. Not only is there the defensive pact at its core, but it manages to do multinational crisis management really, really well. 

&gt;The central European know the ""western betrayal"" when they didn't get sufficient help. What if NATO is a British excuse to not get an appropriate defense for the EU countries. 

That makes so little sense it's almost funny. NATO has had thousands of troops in Germany for decades as a defensive measure, the UK, US and other NATO members spent billions of pounds in putting in infrastructure, troops, equipment, keeping soldiers trained and so on, specifically to defend Europe. 

There are still tens of thousands of soldiers in Germany, there are still air fields, there is pre-placed kit.  Further East you have NATO operations continuing in Kosovo, Maritime and Air task forces, as well as at least one battle group in Eastern Europe (not sure where at the moment..).  NATO has been and continues to be committed to actual defence in Europe, it includes countries not in the EU that are pivotal to the defence of Europe, including Turkey. To turn that around and claim that NATO might be a British excuse not to get an appropriate defence for EU countries is somewhat laughable.

&gt; The NATO is just a military alliance which relies mainly on the US and not specifically on the UK. 

It relies on all its members, the US and Canada happen to be incredibly important as they provide a strategic depth that the EU can't provide on its own, and the US, UK and France are important because they all have very long term, deep  investments in defence.  The point though is that NATO is there for all of its members and everyone is supposed to contribute. There are some disparities at the moment (some that are being addressed..) but it still broadly works.

&gt;If the EU would be one entity it would surpass the UK in military capabilities but still need NATO.

I'd hope that if the EU were one entity it would surpass the UK in terms of military capabilities.. I mean, it includes France which has significant independent capabilities, as well as a slew of other modern countries with large economies.

The point however is that if the EU were one entity, it might well decide to reduce it's spending, training, and capabilities rather than increase them. In short, if it is seen as a cost saving exercise and we see less expenditure in the hope that collective operations boost efficiency, but without bothering with the large investments (and so costs..) required over the first few decades, then you end up with a net negative. 

&gt;EU with the Single Market about the similar size as of the US and China needs to defend its own treasure and good bargaining position that's only when you speak economically.

It should be able to yes. My concern is that it will be less able to if it goes for defence integration and does a really bad job of it.",Royaume-Uni de Grande-Bretagne et d'Irlande du Nord,/r/europe/comments/7j2usm/on_december_7_portugal_and_ireland_announced/dr4r0pu/,ajehals,1513079824

3448,"The UK's commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence is a fudge - it includes a whole load of non-operational costs such as military pensions.

The recent round of budget cuts is baffling.  In theory the UK is increasing defence spending, but budgets are being cut and the three Services are fighting about what they need to lose - hence briefings and counter-briefings in the media.  It is also only a couple of years since the MOD claimed that it had balanced its books thanks to Phil Hammond's love of spreadsheets.

I've seen no official explanation of why we are facing another round of defence cuts, but it strikes me that we are still suffering from widespread financial mismanagement in the MOD.  Major procurement projects continue to go wildly over budget and there have been no serious efforts to deal with the problem.  The Defence Estate is in ""managed decline"" because the Defence Infrastructure Organisation has been dysfunctional for years and we are reaching a crunch point where we may need to pay market rent rates for military housing that we don't own and which we sold off cheap in the late 90s.

Overall despite large defence spending on paper, at maximum effort we couldn't put more than a division in the field supported by a few squadrons of jets and helicopters and a handful of ships.

He knew that all he had to do was wait for a few months and he would be free to return to his people, to this family. And yet deep down the general couldn't bear to suffer the indignity of standing in front of self-appointed judges who called him a criminal to his face. Whatever you may think of the contentious case against Praljak, it's clear that he, like all the other participants in that messy conflict, had his own perspective. He thought he was fighting to defend his people, that is the Croats of Herceg-Bosna against all enemies who wanted to do them harm. In the end he preferred to die for this ideal than to accept the ignominy of being condemned for committing acts of aggression that in his mind (and in the eyes of his people) were acts of self-defense.

3674,"&gt;Mr Clegg, the former Liberal Democrat leader who lost his seat at the general election in June, said it was ‚Äúunforgivable‚Äù of Theresa May, the Prime Minister, not to try to pursue the idea.

If I were King of The EU, I'd certainly do it, even now, were it actually viable in the UK.  But it'd have to sunset at some point, because freedom of movement is intrinsic to blending the EU into a country over time.  And I don't know if that'd sell in the UK.

All that being said, this is missing the point.  You don't need to sell May on Remain.  She supported it.

What you have to do is sell May on having a referendum that says ""Leave"", then saying ""well, the voters didn't really *mean* Leave, because they didn't know about this amazing new deal"".  And there is no way that I can see in which she can get away with doing that from a political standpoint.

She could do it if there were a second referendum.  *But*‚Ä¶to date, a strong majority of Britons are opposed to a second referendum, even though only a weak majority supported Leave.

And there hasn't been any cohesive campaign that I could see for a second referendum for the first year after the referendum.  I do see a lot of articles in the British press trying to promote the idea popping up on Reddit *now*.  So you're talking about somehow trying to effect a major shift in public opinion followed by selling the viability and advisability of a second referendum to the government, then holding it, and getting Brussels onboard with extending the FoM deal, all in a year.  Frankly, that'd be an impressive political operation relative to last year.

Further, the British government cannot announce in advance that it is holding such a referendum if its outcome depends on the result of the treaty negotiotion.  Because otherwise, Brussels will simply give the UK an intentionally-bad deal if it knows that people voting against the deal will cancel Brexit.  So the government would have to be privately-convinced of the need for it, not announce it, complete negotiations, and then hold a surprise referendum *after* the thing is negotiated.  And the Brexit arrangement itself is expected to run up until the deadline.

That's a pretty tight timeframe for a pretty ambitious project.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7iyr3j/eu_leaders_want_to_offer_theresa_may_a_deal_to/dr4j0q4/,vokegaf,1513060557

3721,"* Their surnames end in *-yan/ian*, which means ""son of"".
* Their country's name in Armenian is *Hayastan*. The *Hay* comes from their ethnicity's name and the *-stan* is a Parthian loanword. Prior to having *Hayastan* as their country's name in Armenian, their country was called *Hayk'* which is the plural version of *Hay* (Armenian word for ""Armenian""). According to Armenian mythology, ""Hayk"" was the founder of their nation but he most likely never existed.
* The name *Armen* comes from Persian.
* Capital is Yerevan and they claim the Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) region from Azerbaijan.
* Turkey (under the leadership of the Young Turks) committed genocide on them. Turkey claims it was a deportation in response to Armenians being fifth column citizens during WW1, but it is officially recognized as a genocide and over a million Armens died according to most sources.
* The cultural predecessors of the Indo-European-speaking Armenians were the Urartians.
* 100% of Armenia is geographically in Asia but they are considered part of Europe cause they were part of the Soviet Union. They are culturally and genetically closest to Assyrians.
* They had a Kingdom of Kilikia in the northern Levant.
* The historic homeland of Armenia includes much of modern day eastern Turkey as well as modern day Armenia. Armenia is generally seen as part of the Caucasus today because of it's location, being part of the Russian Empire, Transcaucasian Federation, and the Soviet Union; but if it had it's historic lands (that are part of Turkey today) then it would be seen as a West Asian country.
* Some Armenian nationalists claim the *Javakhk* (*Javakheti*) region of Georgia claiming that it was wrongly given to Georgia because of Stalin (similar to how Azerbaijan acquired Artsakh). It is currently Armenian majority.
* A few live in Iran cause they were deported there by the Safavids.
* Parthians (Arsacid Dynasty) ruled there country for centuries and this left a massive impact on their language which now has a lot of Parthian loanwords. A decent number of Persian words entered their language too I think. Because of this, Armenian was even classified as an Iranic language by some linguists in the past, or at least a branch of the Indo-Iranic languages, but now it is seen as an independent branch within IE languages.
* Lavash is one of the breads there, it's a flat bread similar to the Afghan naan. It's baked in an underground grill called a *tanur* (in Pashto it's called that least).
* Tigranes the Great was their greatest king and was responsible for Armenia's largest ever boundaries.
* Mount Ararat has a lot of cultural significance in Armenia and can be compared to Mount Olympus to Greece. Though it's part of Turkey today.
* First nation to have adopted Christianity as state religion.
* Part of the Eurasian Economic Union. Big allies with Russia who they have helped them survive against Azerbaijan and Turkey.
* I heard a number of Armenians (and Georgians) left to Greece during the Greece-Turkey population exchange.
* Being a conservative Christian country, they are ashamed of the Kardashians.
* Their national church is the Armenian Apostolic Church, which is considered monophysite. Their church belongs to the Oriental Orthodox churches rather than the Eastern Orthodox churches.

3820,"&gt; indeed, but according to you Brexiteers, the UK was to be the first of many countries to walk out of the EU, a missionary spreading the gospel of anti EU. So far, what we have seen is exactly the contrary.

According to some, indeed a small minority of people who supported leaving the EU.  

&gt;And the EU army is at best a thing in a distant future that Brexiteers painted as a certainty because they needed a boogeyman with which to inflame the crowds.

It is a thing in the distant future (and as you point out PESCO doesn't get close). It wasn't just used as a boogeyman though, it was used as an example of an EU that wasn't really what most people in the UK wanted the EU to be.  That was borne out by the remain campaign spending a lot of time debunking the notion that the EU would push specifically on this (PESCO..) and drive a military aspect of the EU. 

If you have a lot of people who see the EU as primarily economic, who aren't terribly happy with, interested in or want to see an expansion of the other aspects that the EU nominally touches on, then this kind of thing is exactly what they see as problematic.  

&gt;Hardly anything resembling a EU army. For that we'd need a common foreign policy and that's decades into the making, assuming we want one. You are indeed paranoid.

I'd argue that this, together with the common foreign and security policy may well be decades away from delivering anything particularly solid, but it shows an EU whose purpose is quite different from that that even many UK remain voters would agree with. That's broadly the problem. The EU as a primarily economic grouping is one thing, an EU that becomes more and more entwined with what a lot of people would see as national competencies is less attractive.

I mean you can throw in the noises about a federal EU we've seen recently too if you want, it's about direction of travel.  The reason defence and an 'EU Army' has been a bit of a bugbear for many is less because it poses a threat, or because it somehow means that Europe becomes some sort of regional military superpower, but rather because it threatens NATO and the current functioning defence structures.  

There is frankly less trust in the EU's ability and willingness to coordinate defence on that basis, there are some (and I'd include myself in that group) that would look at the presentation of a European defence approach as one that is intended to primarily reduce costs, and that has to paper over problems in divergent constitutional and political bases as really quite problematic.

PESCO has some potential in that it might actually be used to increase capabilities if it doesn't turn into a political football, or a prestige thing, assuming there aren't massive fudges, and the EU moves forward in unison without massive concessions to get people on board etc.. In short, if the EU screws this up, or even just doesn't quite get it right, the impact could well be huge, both for EU members, and the EU's neighbours..

Either way, the UK being outside of both EU and obviously this initiative (no doubt working with the EU as a partner where it makes sense) is a good thing as far as the UK is concerned, and no doubt a good thing as far as the EU is concerned too.",Royaume-Uni de Grande-Bretagne et d'Irlande du Nord,/r/europe/comments/7j2usm/on_december_7_portugal_and_ireland_announced/dr463o2/,ajehals,1513044218

3827,"&gt; Why can't Jews live in a Palestinian state? If this is the case, then settlements are not the end of the world. Those Jews could have a choice of getting Palestinian citizenship in that context or get some sort of freedom of movement package like the EU has.

While I am personally not too perturbed by the idea of Israeli settlers staying, the reason why this is often proposed is the settlers dont recognize the legitimacy of the state of Palestine. To be frank, it is going to end in violence either way, with attacks against the settlers by Arabs, or with the Jews just attacking the Arabs. 

&gt; It's just assumed that all Jews will have to leave Palestine during any peace agreement. If Palestinians are going to turn around and let another group like Hamas gain power then sure, they definitely have to leave, but Israel would be stupid to sign a peace agreement if that's the next step.

You make a good point here, but you have to realize that a lot of these settlers have an israeli version of hamas view of Palestine. And it is equally stupid to have there be a bunch of israhamas folks in Palestine. You assume that these people would accept Palestinian citizenship or residency when with the sole exception of some of the Jerusalem suburbs, this is basically their way of saying ""fuck you Palestine, you dont exist"" 

&gt; There are millions of Arabs living in Israel with Israeli citizenship and it's not even on the table that they will ever be kicked out.

Thats not entirely right. While there is not ethnic cleansing at stake, the a derivative of the [Lieberman plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieberman_Plan) has been pushed by the Likud government in the last major negotiation and given the fact that the settlement issue doesnt appear to be moving it will just become more mainstream.

&gt; TIME ONLINE: The PiS decides many reforms late at night, when opposition and media representatives are no longer present to criticize. What about political culture?

What do they mean by this? Parliament working at night is nothing new, especially when opposition spams formal proposals (exactly to complain later that things are done at night). The opposition and media representatives are always present (AFAIK that only happened once: last December, but that was part of the opposition's protest, they did it willingly), no one is throwing them out, the parliament work is recorded, etc.  If they are not there, that is completely up to them.

&gt; But that does not stop millions of Poles from going to England and other western countries to work and bring the money home. This is the Polish hypocrisy, which unfortunately belongs to us.

Idiotic comparison, this ""specialist"" doesnt see the difference between Poles going West LEGALLY to work and the whole clusterfuck of the migrant crisis (most arent refugees, illegally cross borders, only want to live in a few countries like Germany, etc.).

&gt;  there is an enormous amount of domestic violence and other social problems. Neighborly love and solidarity are not far off. There's something wrong.

Whats exactly is ""enormous amounts"", any specific numbers?  No? Shocking... IIRC Poland compares pretty well to many EU countries, our stats are no where near the top (worst).  

&gt; At the beginning of the school year 2017/18, the government implemented a new school reform aimed at gaining control of the curriculum and selecting directors and teachers on the basis of political loyalty.

Any thing to back this claim up? I dont remember any mass firings of directors and teachers.  The reform was mainly returning to the previous system of 8 year primary school and then high school. Funny enough, most people supported getting rid of ""gimnazjum"" (junior high), until PiS decided to do it.

&gt;  The PiS recognises the importance of social media and sends its trolls into all major debates.

Of course, anyone disagreeing with you is a troll... I guess that makes me one also since I dont blindly go along with your empty statements.

&gt; During the summer, hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated against the controversial judicial reform. 

Another lie. The numbers werent anywhere close to that. Even Warsaw Town Hall (opposition politicians that overestimate these numbers) talked about 50 thousand. The police estimated about 15 thousand. I wonder where they got ""hundreds of thousands"" from...

&gt; ZEIT ONLINE: Last week, the EU started proceedings against Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland for not accepting refugees.

Indeed, I guess the rule of law in this case isnt important. 

&gt; Mienkowska: For us, refugees are like the yeti. Everyone knows it exists somewhere, but no one's seen it. 

Wait what? The yeti exists?  What is she talking about? Also, we have to have the specific issue ourselves to know anything about it? We dont read/see things happening in the West? We dont travel there and see for ourselves? Absolute rubish.

&gt; We forget that we were and are also refugees. Millions of Poles have emigrated to Western EU countries. That's the hypocrisy I'm talking about.

Apples and oranges. There is no hypocrisy. Poles were actual refugees during WWII, most of the current ""Syrian refugees"" are not Syrian and are not refugees - they are economic migrants.  And again, comparing Poles (who legally have the right to move/live/work in the EU) to non-EU citizens (who do not have these rights) is idiotic.

&gt; This hypocrisy also exists with regard to the euro. Of course, Poland has also committed itself to converting to the euro sooner or later. But because he had a bad press, the wish was abandoned.

Sure, its only bad press, definitely nothing wrong with the euro, nope, nothing at all.

Snowballs are thrown in the air
No one has any care
About school-only fun 
Because the day is a snowy one

Snowmen are stacked very high
Their top hats almost skim the sky
To make them round they must pat
Then finish off with mittens and hat

As the weather gets cold
The children are told
To come inside and eat
Hot chocolate with a couple treats

Once the kids are done 
They put on their gear for some more fun
Some of them play around
While other kids just lay on the ground

Another kid makes snow angels
Until the dog named Bojangles
Ran through his masterpiece
But then the owner yelled cease

After Bojangles 
Ruined all the snow angels
Kids slid down the hill
'Til they were bitten by a chill

Almost over is the day
The children start to walk away
As snow falls, so does the sun
Time to go in, the day is done

3935,"It wasn't a storm in the sense that it'd have heavy wind speeds, massive amounts of snow, or anything of the sort.
However, our railway system works at a very heavy capacity, to transfer a few million people around the country each day. With snow the brakes on the train don't work as well, which means the trains can't go as fast, which means the schedule already gets screwed with. To add to that, our rail system is complex with loads of switches(for example, this: https://www.google.nl/maps/@52.0930917,5.1067014,164m/data=!3m1!1e3 ) These switches are heated, but still some of them fail every year, taking time to replace, and in the meantime the whole train network clogs up.
At the same time, our highways are just as busy, and when people have to drive slower because of ice, as well as people getting into accidents because they're not used to snow/ice conditions, thus clogging up the rest of the road.
And finally, people love to use bikes, yet after a good snowfall, this becomes a lot harder, and sometimes quite dangerous when it is slippery.
Together, we learned from experience that this means that on a good snowy day, if everybody goes home at 5 o'clock, we get huge trafic jams, accidents, trains failing, etc. and people sometimes take 3+ hours to get home where they'd normally take about an hour or so.
Due to this, people often get half the day off when such a snowfall is expected, so that people don't spend half their day getting home in ""dangerous"" conditions.",,/r/europe/comments/7j114k/right_when_the_storm_hit_leiden_netherlands/dr4059d/,asphias,1513037248

3944,"""Reichsb√ºrger"" are the least of my concerns. They're conspiracy theorists and even if Germany adopted a new constitution, they'd still find a way to deny Germany's sovereignty.

What I'm concerned about with regard to constitutional renewal is the reform of German federalism. Germany has for the most part used the cooperative model of federalism (as has the EU) where law's are mostly made at the federal level while implementation is the task of the states. I'm more in favour of dualistic federalism (as in the Anglo-American model) where feds and states are autonomous from each other in the delivery of their services. What I'd like Germany to do is go down the same road that Switzerland went down at the end of the 90s when the Swiss renewed their own constitution completely and convert to a more mixed federalism. The German states lack autonomy in many regions which they in turn try to make up by stupidly insisting on their self-rule in the education sector.

Moreover, with a new constitution, we could do a lot more (among other things) with regard to:

1) European integration; articles should be included that expressly state that Germany's goal is to become a state of a sovereign, federal Europe.

2) integration of East and West; East Germany got shafted when the GDR got incorporated into the Federal Republic. Something needs to be done about that. I don't know what and I don't know how, but something needs to be done.

3) broader protection of minorities.

4) a new electoral law that does away with the anachronistic 5% threshold and allows for actual proportional representation.

5) taking precautions for the complete economic integration of France and Germany as proposed by Emmanuel Macron in his Sorbonne speech (new √âlys√©e Treaty). France would itself devise the constitution for the VI. French Republic.

As regards European federalisation, Germany ending up a federation within a federation would probably be impractical. To solve this problem - and to strengthen Germany's commitment to a Europe of Regions - the constitution should allow for the European level to be able to legislate directly into L√§nder affairs without having to first accomodate Berlin's concerns.

These are my primary wishes for a new German constitution to cover. Please feel free to add your own.",Est Europa nunc unita,/r/europe/comments/7isffa/german_conservatives_reject_united_states_of/dr40bpj/,Martha-Helen,1513037460

You'd be surprised what can be accomplished with diplomacy. But you're not into diplomacy. You're into suspicion, hostility and the kind of thing which encourages aggression. 

&gt;On the main page they call the Guardian fake news among the numerous posts critical of the Guardian. 

Then the Guardian shouldn't be so into deception and propaganda then. All who like Jeremy Corbyn know this especially well. I don't think they're calling the Guardian fake news either, but rather pointing out how it cheats people often. 

&gt;And of course there are the expected negative posts about Hillary and Macron, and posts defending Russia/Putin. 

Because explaining the other standpoint is *defending* it, right. That's the problem with polarising people like you. That sentence is with Putin name first, would make you be called out as a Putin bot. 

&gt;Funny that there are so many posts critical of censorship, while they praise Putin. Shouldn't they criticize Putin the most? 

It's not necessarily censorship. But also media distortion. That's their point, if you could turn off your knee jerk aggression for 5 minutes. That Putin is not being heard to begin with; while if the Guardian presented things in a much less biased way, they wouldn't need to do anything. Thus they don't need to critisize Putin, because he's already being destroyed in the Western media. 

It's beautiful you reference Freedom House. I assume you know it's US-controlled right? Also, Soros is but one billionaire playing the game. 

Regardless of your attempted derailment, it's not new that the West sponsors terrorists. This goes back to at least WW2. **But you don't deal with any of the arguments head on. instead you refer to outside sources for legitimacy.**

3993,"When you get that far north, the shifting weather with wind, snow, rain and shifts between plus and minus degrees makes for a lethal combo that can be hard to ward off. In my town it comes to a point where salt doesn't do much anymore, because the ice melts and freezes again seconds later. The wind will polish the ice, and the snow will cover it up and add on to it. [Snowplows](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Sneeuwschuiver.jpg/1280px-Sneeuwschuiver.jpg) mainly deal with the snow, and many have an even edge on the bottom, so they'll just end up polishing the ice underneath which makes it even more slippery. Some plowers will have [ice scrapers](https://st.mascus.com/imagetilewm/product/e76b7a24/esko-250,4e4c39fa.jpg) attached that will shave some of the ice off, but mainly they'll just make ridges in it to make it less of an even surface. The ice will still be there, just not as slippery (if you have good tires with good grip). Even so, these guys often mainly focus on the big communal roads and main roads. They require high speeds and power, which doesn't mix well with residential areas (or times of high traffic). Add some mountains and steep hills on top of that, and you've got yourself a real slippery slope. So, for city driving you could be okay with the studfree wintertires, but if you live in more remote areas (Northern Nordics), chances are you could go days without even seeing the plower and would probably be better off with some metal studs (and your own plow). All in all, studs is recommended as it is safer and easier to drive with on real winter roads, as the stopping distance shortens and the grip helps you recover easier if you start to skid.

*    a 17 per cent reduction in heart attack admissions to nine Scottish hospitals. This compares with an annual reduction in Scottish admissions for heart attack of 3 per cent per year in the decade before the ban
*    a 39 per cent reduction in second-hand smoke exposure in 11-year-olds and in adult non-smokers
*   no evidence of smoking shifting from public places into the home

Sources?

&gt;I love that you use an article written by some bartender as evidence that banning smoking isnt helping public health, reducing the amount of smokers does. And what is -one of the factors- of doing that? reducing arenas where you can smoke

Actually, that's **exactly** the issue studies like [The Effect of a Statewide Smoking Ordinance on Acute Myocardial Infarction Rates](http://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343%2813%2900837-1/fulltext), [A Nationwide Assessment of the Association of Smoking Bans and Cigarette Taxes With Hospitalizations for Acute Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, and Pneumonia](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1077558716668646) and [Changes in U.S. Hospitalizationand Mortality Rates FollowingSmoking Bans](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pam.20548/epdf?referrer_access_token=QUp9eblDlSEInJtIoRXTFU4keas67K9QMdWULTWMo8MkuYAmIPtQURQVNxZVh5zJJRrnIl3hqWxPUueuRCFwCDRIN__8Tloa6iC28uzshjNOGUHe7NHKpUmaTqZVK3i7mQMETzdqKZJken38er3z2MRt-dlBDG8BNqg8zYYH9PV1h-6Kn2H4robnEcfAl20_Rcu6zp3fE7AKTmGAX7C08LA4WInWIAHlNP7pt-37h1093WlXW-aTsQ5QfXlLgCwGwHRqQRGw6xg7MbSwLy6VyjrKquWUC-eU6RUUV_uh6v1Pj7PJHGeNTHZuQPtAiRzV) address. 

And those and other studies have consistently found that's false. As I said in my comment. Yet you simply pretend that didn't happen. I mean, if you're simply going to disregard what we know, reject all sort of nuance and intellectual sophistication and just keep screaming insults and repeat the same false assertions over and over while pretending that those who disagree with you are pure evil, there's nothing to discuss here. 


&gt;You are acting like people believe this ONE ban will fix everything, it wont, but its a part of a total package that will help lowering the amount of people who die of lung cancer. But sure, keep up your shitty attitude to people to disgree with you, im sure that helps

4179,"&gt;Let's forget about 2017 for a second. In the end of 2016 we have two growth rates - [the quarterly one](https://tradingeconomics.com/turkey/gdp-growth) and [the yearly one](https://tradingeconomics.com/turkey/gdp-growth-annual). So in the last quarter of 2016 we have 4,2% yearly growth (you said 3,5% but if I remember correctly you were right, they must have revised it up to 4,2%) and 4,9% growth compared to last quarter, so the economy grew by 4,9% in three months (this number has also been revised up).     

&gt;And yes yearly growth in Q3 is 11% like you said.

&gt;I mean Turkey was faster in just that quarter. China has never grown so fast in one quarter, but it has grown faster in a year, yes. Also while we don't have Turkey's growth by the end of 2017 we know that in Q3 it is growing much faster than China currently is.    

We have predictions for the the Turkish growth in 2017 and it is about 5-7%.The predictions for the q3 were 9%-10% so we would see a similar outcome.

China has grown faster in a quarter than 11%(they did just few years ago).Turkish growth in q3 is high but the growth in q1 and q2 were around 5%.

The %11 doesn't mean the country would grow 11% in total.As i said the growth is probably gonna be around 7%.

&gt;Well that's a news article and they're not always accurate. I trust Trading Economics more. I also looked at Turkey's official statistics here- http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/PreTablo.do?alt_id=1098   

Well it seems like it is a different stat that i made a mistake translating.

&gt;There aren't, not compared to last year. The best is Romania at 8% and something. No one around the world is reporting higher yearly growth in Q3.    

I was talking about the q2 and the total growth isn't going to be the highest in the world and some Eastern European countries might be higher depending on the q4 growth (very unlikely atm).

&gt;And you have to ask yourself what is driving that humongous growth. It's not exports, both you and I agreed imports are rising faster so they're actually taking away from growth and something has to compensate them even harder to get 11%.     

Exports are growing faster than imports(in all quarters.You can check that on Turkstas site on growths in quarters and the highest import growth is 14% in q3 which is still less than the export growth).

&gt;It's not private consumption either. While we still haven't agreed what retail sales were, even what you claim is way too low to fuel such high growth.    

Houshold consumption is increasing.Retail turnover and retail sales are also increasing year on year basis(both from Turkstat).

&gt;The only things left are government consumption and foreign investment. That is very unlikely in my opinion. For one thing those two are  usually a smallish part of GDP, so they would need a gigantic increase to pull up overall GDP by 11%.     

Goverment is creating a fund worth 70 billion dollars to support the economy,giving more support to many sectors and cutting taxes on many stuff while increasing consumption.This is greatly increasing the growth rate but this isn't suistainable in the long run.Another important thing is the gdp shrink in q3 2016 which makes the growth higher since this is q3 2017 compared to that.Also the goverment changed the calculation year which make increased the growth 0,5%-1%(i am repeating what i said but this is part of the answer).

&gt;Why would investments be increasing to the highest they've ever been  while the government is threatened by a coup, while the government seizes businesses of suspected Gulenists, while Turkey is entering a diplomatic spat with Europe (by far it's most important partner), while the prospect of EU membership seems to have vanished, while relations with the US are going terribly (just the news of suspended visas sent the lira tumbling)?   

&gt;Any one of those alone should make Turkey much more unattractive for investments compared to before. Combined it seems to me you would have to be crazy to invest right now, and yet apparently investments have gone though the roof?  

The companies that are investing are usually big ones that have connections with Turkey and the goverment.Daimler (which some fuckers said that harbors Gulenists which got removed soon after) said that they want to invest more into Turkey and goverment apologized from them after some super smart guy accused them of harboring Gulenists.Some Arabic(espically Qatar which own shares in some Turkish compared, directly support some projects and gave promises to make billions worth investment) countries are also investing heavly into many projects which boosts production and investment.The political instabilty is mostly over compared to last year because coup didn't have both public and army support while Erdoƒüan pushed a new referendum so he has to worry less now.As i said economy guys in AKP are smart so they try hard to attract more investment and help companies.

Direct foreing investment recovered a lot since 2016 but it is still less than 2015.

&gt;Furthermore investments are just money going in. Even if assume investment has increased so much, there still should be many people, real Gulenists or not, taking their money away from Turkey because it's not safe.

Gulenists already lost basically all of their big companies pre-coup and what is left was small or mid sized companies.The other big companies are cozy with the goverment so they don't move their money away while small and medium ones also don't.

&gt;It just doesn't make sense and there's not enough real data to support such growth, especially in light of increasing unemployment. 

The unemployment is decreasing and also number of employed people is increasing(you are not factoring in the high Turkish population growth and refugees getting work permits).

&gt;This is why we should look at facts and statistics which have more meaning to them than just words. Those economists say investments, but how much investments? They may be big but are they big enough to influence GDP growth by several points? That's why I'd like it if we stick to numbers.       

&gt;The thing is, this just doesn't make sense. Even if it's possible for Turkey to grow 11% this is the last year you would be expecting it to happen. 

The thing is you are trying to think this as a completely healthy growth but it isn't which i think why we are having problems at understansing each other.Goverment is doing the stuff i wrote to increase growth which is working but they can't keep doing it forever.",Meskhetian Turk,/r/europe/comments/7j1dzk/turkeys_11_economic_growth_fuels_expectations_of/dr3mora/,komenistayibey,1513022927

&gt; There is no point in arguing here.

Yeah, exactly, you are just talking out of your ass trying to be a ""centrist"" with this pathetic 'hurr durr I don't support PiS, but TVN is just as bad as TVP"" angle, when any sane person from Poland will say that there is not even a comparison between what TVP does and what TVN does. Buy you know what, I'll give you a chance. Feel free to post fragments of TVN broadcast where they called for 
""abolishment of government"" and ""violence and crowd.""

- Sunni and Shia weren't always fighting. In many places, *precisely like Syria* they resided side by side in peace.

- The West purposely tried to create those problems between the groups. As I linked to before. 

- It's not as big a deal as the media makes it out to be. In Iran for example, all talk of Sunni and Shia fighting each other, is banned. All must treat each other well. 

- In places like Iraq, both groups intermarried too. Until the West toppled Saddam and destroyed society. 

So it's a super basic interpretation and it actually only helps obscure the fact that this isn't simply a religious conflict.

4265,"&gt;I'm not saying what I'm proposing is likely to happen given the political realities, but why would that be, public reaction aside, a bad idea?

Which part, using immigrants to crush the American worker, or setting up cultural conversion centers in the North Dakota badlands?

&gt;I think America's greatest strength is its ability to rapidly integrate immigrant populations, and that in the absence of artificial barriers you get near complete integration in 2 generations.

And I think this is a viewpoint based more on self-serving propaganda and a shallow understanding of our actual history.  George Washington didn't hit the Open Borders button in 1789 and we've been a constant churn of immigrants ever since.  The material conditions have changed greatly since the pre-WW1 immigration boom - we have no empty factories that need filling, nor empty land that needs farmsteading.

&gt;Given the Republican party's poor performance amongst non-white voters of late, it would also be in their interest to find some way to endear themselves to new immigrants. I think they'd find many of the populations would support them politically if they weren't being attacked for their immigrant status. Example; latin american migrants are quite religious and would embrace ""family values"" republican policies, but they don't because the republicans are always talking about deporting them.

This is an infantile analysis of the politics of our immigrants.  Besides the fact that that meme has been repeated forever, where is the evidence that latin american immigrants are more religious than anyone else, and that that religiousity translates into conservative politics?  I've never actually seen evidence backing that up.  In reality, it's just a smokescreen put out by those advocating increased immigration, either pro-business chamber of commerce types who want cheap labor, or their progressive allies who know they can rely on immigrant communities to vote for them.

George W Bush was 100% pro-immigration, couldn't get enough of hispanic immigration especially (the whole Bush clan is like that) and he still only got 40% or less of the hispanic vote both times.  If your statement was true, he should've gotten 90% of the hispanic vote - he was deeply religious, ran almost solely on family values, and was incredibly welcoming to immigrants.  Instead he lost out that voting block by a huge margin.",,/r/europe/comments/7j1x5d/merkel_end_smuggling_and_slavery_allow_legal/dr3fjgm/,ConsoleWarCriminal,1513015605

There's a good argument that Rafale is a better fit for the post-Cold War world, but this kind of dick-waving argument based only on the strongpoints of each aircraft (payload for the Rafale, speed and service ceiling for the Eurofighter) is juvenile and pointless.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/7iwbtv/qatar_buys_24_eurofighter_jets_for_6bn/dr385o5/,Rc72,1513007914

4331,"&gt; First, that would still invalidate a democratic consensus, and thus still not demonstrate how catalan politicians haven't tried. 

The judiscative, responsible for interpreting law, invalidates the democratic consensus. Right.

&gt; Second, you are very hung up on the singular detail of language. To an outsider this means jackshit and is a very, very stupid reason to demolish a democratic consensus reached through a troublesome parliamentary process.

Troublesome parliamentary process... lol you really werent around. No this is a major point and not just jackshit. I could go on to explain why this is a very important point, but if you want another: total authority over immigration. Within the same country. Someone from Madrid could be denied to visit Catalonia. In the estatut it also declared Catalonia as nation *with real legal character*, the spanish constitution would be second to the catalan estatut and there are still some more. 

That is literally just separation light if not full separation. Nowhere would such an estatut from an autonomy within a country be approved. Nowhere. With good reason. 

&gt; Apparently they were ready to compromise as the estatut was a compromise. It's not their fault that the compromise, which had a majority in spanish parliament as well, was destroyed by PP.

Oh yeah? Then lets hear it. On what did they compromise? And why do you keep pointing out the PP when several autonomies fought against it before the PP was even in power?

&gt; The estatut was a nice try. With PP however a similar effort is doomed from the start. I personally don't blame the catalans for realizing that simple fact and wishing for Europe to step in and lead neutral negotiations (even though Europe refused as well).

Sorry you simply have no idea about the estatut.

4352,"&gt; regarded as the world's police force for exactly that role. 

World police has always been an ominous term: 

- It disguises illegal US action behind the term ""police"", which is a positively charged word. 

- It creates the assumption that the US is trying to help and protect and uphold laws, as that's what a police force is meant to do. But the US doesn't. 

- It's particularly misplaced given how violent and militaristic we know *actual* US police to be. Especially towards minorities. 

&gt;True, the circumstances of the country's foundation give it a somewhat unique position and since you find jewish community all around the world, they have support and activists all over the world.

&gt;They are basically really good at internatinal politics. Good for them. 

- No they're playing on the confusion between the Israeli state and Jews. Thus many erroneously think being critical of the Israeli state, is the same as anti-semitism and thus something to do with the holocaust, ultimately. 

- Many Jews are against Israel. But they're rarely put in front of a camera and asked to explain why. 

- Israel is about more than Jews. 

&gt;Because Iran is actually considered a rogue state. Look up the term and you will see what the defining difference is.

&gt;Is there a double standard? Yes! In the West we hold democracies to higher standards than dictatorships.

- How many countries has Iran attacked recently? No. 

- How much sectarian conflict has there been in Iran? None. 

- Has Iran followed the terms of the nuclear deal? Yes, hugely. Also allowing highly intrusive inspections. 

- Has Iran signed up to the Paris climate agreement? Yes. 

- Who destroyed Irans democracy anyway? That's right, the US, in the 1953 coup with the UK.

The US isn't a democracy; maybe that's why it's not being held to a high standard. 

Iran is also considered a rogue state only because it goes against US interests. 

&gt;In geopolitics? Certainly. Did you assume there was?

This is a ridiculous response and I expect better from you. You're only saying this because it's about the US/Israel. I'll bet you'd be condemning the lack of justice or action if some country you and they don't like, did something. Consider that Russia had to be sanctioned for annexing Crimea, but the US launched missiles at Syria at no cost, despite it being done illegally as well. It's odd that when talking about any of this, we talk about the stability the US brought, how it helped create international institutions to help stop injustice and yet when we come to the question of sanctioning/punishing Israel and its clients, then *""Did you assume there was justice?""*.  Before long, we're back to *""Syria should be punished for the gas attacks on innocent people!""*. . . It's a double-standard of huge proportions and shows how captured the minds of Europeans are to US/Israeli dominance.

4354,"This is 100% NOT what I am trying to say.

---

The points I was trying to make with data, rather than a subjective text block were:

- The ""84%"" figure is from a questionable source, CEOP gives it at 75%. (which is obviously still high)
- The 75% is ""only"" for Type 1 offences, not **all** sex crimes
- Type 1 accounts for only 3% of UK grooming charges
- Type 1 crimes are not **specifically** paedophiles, with victims in the 13-29 age range
- The CEOP study is a single year (2012) - and the group themselves suggest it is possible inaccurate

Additonally:

- Type 1 offences are typically groups, rather than Type 2 which is lone operators

There were 65 Type 1 charges in 2012, with the average grouping being 20 individuals, so around 3 seperate charges - versus a minimum of 2120 for Type 2 crimes - which are lone (ie. single) operators. 

Hence CEOP themselves suggests ""conclusions should be drawn cautiously"".

Critique of the actions of a government is not anti-semitism anymore than it's racism to critique the government of Uganda, because they're black. 

&gt;or fight against Jewish nationalism 

There's other Jews who are against Zionism too. Like the ultra-orthodox Jews, who follow Judaism strictly. Are you going to call them antisemitic too? That would be ridiculous. Not to mention it's not Jewish nationalism, it's Israeli nationalism, since you don't need to be Jewish to be a Zionist. 

So how about you stop abusing words. Because when the **real** antisemites come forth, you won't have a word for them.

This has led to the logical conclusion that Catalonia has little to expect within the framework of the spanish constitution.

Socially she's a moderate conservative in that she's against gay marriage and abortion (but the German people disagree with her).

On immigration she's liberal-conservative. She denounced multiculturalism and was never a great advocate for immigration. Merkel only opened the borders in 2016 because she thought it was her best choice. The backlash made her and CDU/CSU go the other way and toughen laws multiple times. For example, CDU/CSU wants to make it difficult for north Africans to claim asylum by declaring those safe countries of origin.

4473,"You can be welcoming within reason, yes. We've long transgressed beyond reason in most of the Western world. Reasonable would be to only accept a tiny number of migrants that'll be beneficial to the nation.

If you're so welcoming that everyone and anyone can freely enter your nation state, as most of Western Europe currently is, you'll just end up destroying the very state you live in, or at least you'll end up destroying all the good things a nation state usually brings with it: social cohesion, safety for the people, social welfare nets, a common culture etc.

It's quite obvious that the large scale immigration from Muslim countries, Africa, Pakistan, Bangladesh etc. is slowly destroying Europe for ethnic Europeans since these migrants are worse than the average European by every single standard of measure, whether it's employment rates, crime rate, social welfare recipience  rates, educational achievements or anything else. You're also actively practicing dysgenics by letting certain people in, for example 30% of genetic birth defects in the UK are caused by the inbred Pakistani community due to cousin marriage.

Fuck that kind of welcoming. Every day I'm more confident in my opinion that an ethnostate like Japan is preferable in every way to the multicultural diversity dystopia we're rapidly ""progressing"" towards.

4527,"&gt; If you beat someone up who breaks into your house, it's self defense. If you lock him in your cellar for twenty years, you're a sick fuck.

These real-life analogies for foreign policy issues rarely have any relevance. But if you want to go there - if the person who broke into your house continues to threaten you, then it's completely reasonable to look him up if you don't want to get hurt, specially if your experience is that every time you tried to let him go, he tried to carry out those threats.

&gt; Now that's bullshit. The USSR kept Czechia as a buffer zone against NATO. Shall we invite them back?

Czechs were not blowing themselves up or stabbing people in the streets of Moscow were they?

But yes, the reality is that the USSR did want to have us in their sphere of influence as a buffer state and in the context of the CW, it made sense from their point of view. It sucked for us and obviously I wouldn't want it to happen again, but I can't deny that in the CW it made sense. Just as it made sense for Israel to maintain buffer zones when they didn't have peace treaties secured with their neighbours.

&gt; More bullshit. Terrorism didn't start until after the occupation. Of course they're going to turn to terrorism if you deny them legitimate representation in the form of a state.

They already could have had a legitimate representation, the peace treaty was very close in 2000 in the Camp David. Arafat had a bigger role in blewing it than Barak. The Palestinians are never ever gonna have a peace treaty when they cannot even mentally accept that the Israeli state exists and will continue to exist. First they have to give up terrorism and only after that they can have the peace treaty, it cannot go the other way around.

&gt; Really, what makes the Palestine territories so different that terrorists would do there what they couldn't do in Lebanon or Syria?

Well, they are geographically closer to Israelis. If Israel hands over the Eastern part of Jerusalem to Palestinian authorities, then the whole western part will be exposed to Palestinian terrorism.

&gt; Your security from Russia depends on NATO and EU. If that fails, Israel is not going to help you.

Of course Israel cannot help us against Russia, they are even smaller country than we are. At best they could help us in cyber defense. But that's not my point. My point is that I wouldn't want the US to ditch us because we cannot help them as much as they can help us, so I don't want us to do the same to Israel.

Or would you like your own country to behave this way? Would you want to ditch every ally that simply doesn't have the means to be as useful to you as you can be useful to them? Why even have alliences between countries of a different sizes and strenghts then if you don't intend to honour your obligations to the smaller and weaker states?

&gt; You just produced a number of sentences with the keywords balanced and moderate. So that was just for show?

Balanced in this context doesn't mean neutral. I meant that we can balance the position within the EU, where some member are more on the Palestinian side, so we can be more on the Israeli side and balance the final position.

We are also somewhere in between Trump and the official EU position, which shows that we're trying to balance between our commitments to the EU and between our commitments to Israel.

&gt; Israel sponsored Hamas in the beginning as a counterweight to PLO. Netanyahu even ordered to release the Hamas leader from prison, even though he was serving a life sentence.

The different threats to Israel obviously do not remain on the same level throughout time, sometimes one threat needs to be handled with a priority compared to another threat and later on the situation changes and so does the approach.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/7i1jek/czechia_announces_it_recognizes_west_jerusalem_as/dr2ydx7/,kristynaZ,1512993410

A favourite technique was to hold a man upside down, his head in a bucket of water, while sand was rammed into his rectum with a stick. Women were gang-raped by the guards. People were mauled by dogs and electrocuted. The British devised a special tool which they used for first crushing and then ripping off testicles. They used pliers to mutilate women's breasts. They cut off inmates' ears and fingers and gouged out their eyes. They dragged people behind Land Rovers until their bodies disintegrated. Men were rolled up in barbed wire and kicked around the compound.

Maybe you'll understand if I directly reply to your questions.

&gt; No they would both own the territory, could move freely, the municipalities would be governed by locals but the state would be open to everyone therefore it is semi-autonomous to be correct. 

That's bullshit. The political system would be corrupted to favor the Greek Cypriot majority and make Turkish Cypriots 2nd class citizens again. Just like picking the national anthem, national decisions would be taken without any consideration for the Turks because ethnicities don't exist on a spectrum like political beliefs on the economy or gay rights. A person wouldn't vote on the Turkish side one day and vote like a Greek the next. If Cypriot politics could overcome this problem we wouldn't be here in the first place.

&gt; You don't think majority rules is how a modern democracy works?

No it isn't. The established order, social contract or constitution or political consensus, whatever you want to call it, is not decided by a vote. An overwhelming number of citizens must accept said order for it to survive. The Cyprus that the Greeks were building was rejected by the Turkish Cypriots and that was enough to break the country. Honestly I'm not surprised at how Greeks can think the Turks on the island would subject themselves to an order they'd consider unacceptable themselves if the roles were reversed.

&gt; Enosis would have been exactly the opposite of what?

4656,"&gt;Because there's a lack of mutual trust. How do you hand over territories to people who plot terror attacks against you on frequent bases?

What do you expect, if the only thing they get from Israel is endless occupation? Don't sit on their face if you don't want them to bite you in the ass.

&gt;Israelies have legitimate fears that if they hand over territories to Palestianians, those territories will be just immediately turned into Hamas and Hezbollah hot beds that will treathen Israelis.

And Palestinians live in the objective reality that Israel keeps them under occupation indefinitely.

&gt;It's not Israel that decided to get in this fucked up situation in the first place. Arabs could have just accepted the 1948 division. Or they could have accepted the 1967 division. They attacked Israel, Israel understandably defended itself and while you can say that they have made mistakes in that, it's not them who started the wars. Palestinians have largely their Arab neighbours to blame for the situation they are in.

I recognize the legitimacy of Israels defensive war and their victory. I do not recognize their legitimacy of their neverending occupation.

&gt;Israel wants Jerusalem to be internationally recognized as their capital, this is not just a political problem, it's sentimental issue for them too. So from our part, this is a warm gesture of good-will towards our ally.

And a legitimization of an occupation which has been the most wonderful excuse for every perfidious leader in the Muslim world to distract their population from their own corruption, in addition to being a prime recruiting point for terrorist organizations. Besides, ""ally""? Israel ain't doing shit for you.

&gt;I know I repeat myself, but the pro-Israeli stance is a traditional part of the Czech foreign policy. It's not always something pragmatic, we are not always doing it with some cold, calculated interest, it doesn't need to have some direct advantage for us. We are just doing it, because we have sentimental ties with Israel.

So you're stimulating terrorism out of sentimentality?

&gt;I agree and I don't blame other countries for picking a different side. At the same time, I don't see why we should be blamed when we pick the Israeli side. We don't necessarily primarely care about the consequences for the peace process - we know that we're a small country in the world context and that no matter what we do, we don't have the diplomatic power to somehow unblock this issue. We are simply supporting a fellow small country that happens to be our close ally.

If you're just a small country then why bother to declare anything at all? Clearly you think it matters. 

Other countries are not picking a different side, they do not recognize Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital. That is the neutral position.

4665,"&gt; Now Theresa May has made it through the first round of Brexit negotiations, a bigger question becomes more pressing: what sort of Europe will Britain be dealing with in next year‚Äôs trade talks ‚Äì and beyond? The answer to this question came from Martin Schulz, leader of Germany‚Äôs Social Democrats, at this week‚Äôs SPD party conference, when he called for a United States of Europe by 2025. ‚ÄòThe Europe we want does not exist right now ‚Äì we need to create it,‚Äô he declared. ‚ÄòEconomic, cultural, social and political integration is the best protection against fascism, war and anti-democracy.‚Äô

&gt; That Schulz should be in favour of a federal Europe is no surprise. As President of the European Parliament until last year, he made no secret of his desire for ever closer European Union. However the timing of this speech is significant ‚Äì and so is the tone. When he became SPD leader a year ago, the Social Democrats were becalmed on 22 per cent in the polls. With his down-to-earth, no-nonsense manner, Schulz was widely expected to improve dramatically on this dismal showing. Instead, in September‚Äôs election his SPD polled a mere 20.5 per cent, the party‚Äôs worst return since the war.

&gt; During that campaign Schulz devoted little time to Europe (clearly, party strategists had decided the topic was a turn-off for German voters) yet his focus on domestic matters didn‚Äôt garner any extra votes. Now he‚Äôs decided to stop apologising for Europe, and make his Europhilia his main selling point.

&gt; The SPD has spent the last four years as the junior partner in a Grand Coalition with Angela Merkel‚Äôs Christian Democrats, and has consequently lost votes to smaller parties ‚Äì on the left and on the right. With his left wing credentials and his working class roots, at first Schulz looked like he might be the right man to win back these disenchanted voters. September‚Äôs election proved otherwise. His ‚ÄòUnited States of Europe‚Äô speech shows he‚Äôs now more concerned about shoring up the party‚Äôs existing base.

&gt; In an interview with Deutsche Welle, on the conference floor, Schulz sought to temper the contents of his speech. Nation states like France and Germany would never become mere states, like California or Texas, he said. ‚ÄòNational sovereignty is strong and will remain,‚Äô he added. ‚ÄòTo deepen transnational cooperation ‚Äì that‚Äôs what I mean by the United States of Europe.‚Äô Yet in his speech, he urged delegates to develop a passion for Europe. ‚ÄòPeople must realise that Europe can make a difference in their everyday lives.‚Äô

&gt; The SPD has been an effective coalition partner these last four years ‚Äì and until a new coalition is formed it remains in office, alongside the CDU. But competence is not the main sticking point. The SPD‚Äôs biggest problem is that voters no longer know what it stands for. Schulz‚Äôs speech is a rebranding exercise, an affirmation that his SPD remains distinct and separate from Merkel‚Äôs Eurotepid CDU. ‚ÄòWe Are Europe‚Äô proclaimed the banners brandished by enthusiastic delegates on the conference floor. Such rampant Europhilia may alienate a lot of German voters, but it will give the party a clear identity ‚Äì an identity it lost governing alongside the CDU.

&gt; Proclaiming 2025 as the target date for a United States of Europe is more symbolic than realistic, a landmark for SPD members rather than Germans as a whole. Way back in 1925, during the Weimar Republic, the SPD made a similar proposal, which is why Schulz has pegged his own policy to 2025. It‚Äôs a reminder to SPD supporters that theirs is a party with a long and illustrious history, not just a pliant partner for Merkel‚Äôs CDU.

&gt; This appeal to the party faithful, rather than the wider audience outside the conference hall, shows Schulz is gearing up to enter another Grand Coalition ‚Äì despite all his previous protestations that he‚Äôd countenance no such thing. If he enters another coalition, there‚Äôll be no new election (and no need to win over floating voters) but he knows many SPD members will be aghast. His ‚ÄòUnited States of Europe‚Äô speech is aimed at reassuring SPD diehards that their party will fight to implement a radical agenda of its own.

&gt; Schulz is determined to drive a hard bargain with Merkel, and he‚Äôs well placed to do so. Despite his wretched performance in September‚Äôs election, he‚Äôs in a much stronger position now than he was before. Despite emerging as the largest party, Merkel‚Äôs CDU also performed poorly in the election, down to 33 per cent (their worst showing for half a century) and the collapse of coalition talks between her CDU, the Greens and the Free Democrats leaves Schulz‚Äôs SPD as the only party who can give her a working majority. Her only other options are a minority government or another election, and both these options are fraught with danger. For Merkel, a coalition with the SPD is now the only show in town.

&gt; Schulz will be a big player in German and European politics throughout the Brexit process. For him, Brexit isn‚Äôt a setback so much as an opportunity. With Britain putting on the brakes, the EU juggernaut was never going to travel in the direction that he wanted ‚Äì towards a unified fiscal strategy and a single foreign policy, a United States of Europe in all but name. At first, Eurocrats were fearful that other EU members would follow Britain out of the EU. Now Schulz has dared them to do so, if they‚Äôre not willing to converge. Rather than retaining members at all costs in a wider, shallower Europe, Martin Schulz favours a deeper (and, if necessary, smaller) EU. And by 2025 he may well get it.",,/r/europe/comments/7j1a4s/martin_schulz_has_dared_eu_members_converge_or/dr2vsdc/,Petemcfuzzbuzz,1512986665

Then why do they have credit ratings?

4863,"&gt; How many decades it took to dismantle communism? 

Around one after people had started getting really fed up over here, from what I've heard. That's beyond the point though.

The point is, every single Maidanese regime change began with a promise of reform and ended in misery. Yuschenko got voted out in Yanukovich's favor. Poroshenko turned out to be just as much of an oligarch as we warned. Saakashvili is the new hot thing, and from the looks of it, he may be able to perform reforms, but it's known how much he loves power. Take a look at the Georgian charges against him to get an idea.

So there goes the obvious question, how long will it take until people like the fringe nationalists and/or Timoshenko start screaming about oppressed opposition again, and bring yet another revolt to completion with the support of an oligarch who's currently out of favor?

A chain of revolutions won't magically bring Ukraine to prosperity. The only achievement will be another redistribution of assets after each regime change, draining the country of wealth and resources. Ukraine needs reform and investment, not perpetual instability and arguments about who's more of a Russian agent, the current ruler or the current rebel.",insane russian imperialist; literally Putin,/r/europe/comments/7iu43x/approximately_10_thousand_ukrainians_protest/dr2qdb6/,z651,1512973505

If they want to get to the EU level of legislation, there needs to be reform, and for that there needs to be at least some stability, not a revolution and a subsequent redistribution of assets.

And we warned this was going to happen, yet now both Ukrainians and European agencies have to open their eyes wide and say ""gee golly gosh, how unexpected that an oligarch took the whole country over when we let him become president!""

I never denied that the refugees being distributed were mostly Iraqi or Syrian. I denied that the refugees were applying for asylum to the Polish government. They aren't, because they don't want to be in Poland. The quota system is about physically relocating the refugees, not asking countries to handle bureacracy. The refugees aren't getting a say on where they want to go under the redistribution scheme. The EU is trying to take refugees that applied for asylum in Italy or Greece and redistributing a certain number of them to each country.

4940,"I'm also from the North of Portugal, from Braga. I've studied in Porto, I've tasted the supposed best francesinhas there and I always found them to be quite meh. The best francesinha for me is from Taberna Belga here in Braga. 

Braga isn't nearly as big as Porto, it's growing but it's still a small town. Taberna Belga is the only restaurant in town that is consistently full with loads of people waiting outside for 20 min to 1 hour for a table depending on the size of the group (they don't do reservations). 

Their sauce is a bit different from the traditional one but people that come here usually say that it's definitely for the better and I agree. It's way more balanced, homogeneous and flavorsome. Also the ingredients they use are usually higher quality and cooked better than the ones I ate in Porto. For example, the steak in the francesinhas I ate in Porto were always from a cheaper cut and cut very thinly that it had no caramelization  and it was always cooked medium-well. In Taberna Belga they use rib-eye steak and you can ask them to get you a thick one cooked medium-rare without extra charge.

Of course this is just my opinion, but it's no coincidence that Taberna Belga is full every day of the week at both dinner and lunch, with groups waiting outside for up to one and a half hours. I've never seen that in any other place nearby and to happen in such a small town like Braga is quite the feat.

First of all let's make something clear. The fact that you are debating germany giving reparations to Greece is positive compared to not discussing the matter. Secondly, at the moment the german state is obliged to give to Greek individuals reparations according to final decisions made by international courts, yet the german state doesn't. Thirdly, the estimated german debt to Greeks and Greece is at the moment 1,5 trillion US dollars. Fourthly, I am certain that Greece and Greeks would be more than willing to accept a deal that will not destroy germany, unlike the attitude germany and germans have shown in the past few years. At the very least, personally, I'd consider fair for ""our debt"" to be completely scrapped or taken by the germany state. Then do with that anything you like, like I'd give a damn. As germany owes greece 1,5 trillion dollars while ""our debt"" is just 500 billion, germany would end up owing us 1 trillion dollars. A part of this could be given in non monetary form (as germany has done in the past for other countries) and another could be given in monetary form. Don't worry, we won't be assholes like you have been, we will be lenient and understanding. But fair is fair, and you owe us 1,5 trillion dollars! Time to give them back.

I wrote kind of a long response and then my phone died, I'll summarize it shortly in some points:

Reliance in hadith isn't divided between 'absolute certainty' and 'total dismissal', there are varying degrees of reliance, which are often informed by ones political persuasion and prejudices. 

It isn't a handwave, nobody believes that you have to dismiss all of Bukhari just because you think he got a lot wrong, it's about degree of skepticism versus trust and about a holistic understanding of the religion to be able to establish a hierarchy of legitimacy. Bukhari and other canonical books have been proven by both Islamic and non-Islamic scholars to be far from reliable to the degree that fundamentalists view them.

I'm not saying this rudely or maliciously at all, but I'm surprised that you'd say 'until modern methods are applied' when they already have. The debate didn't end and nor did it stay within Islamic scholarship. Orientalists have long gone back and forth on the reliability of hadith, and the consensus in the Western historiography is that while many canonical hadith which are considered to have reliable isnad actually show indication of being attributed to the Prophet or his companions *after* the positions they justify have been debated by scholars, among other possible reasons for fabrication, there are also indications that many of them have been justified as being likely to be reliable in that the method of isnad and timeline is consistent. There are many other factors to determine that. 

What I'm suggesting is that hadith has varying degrees of reliability and that the most important criteria for it is if it demonstrates inconsistencies with the rules and limitations in the Quran. 

The canonical books are still used because they are deeply ingrained in Islamic systems of governance and education. To me that is a problem because there is little justification to keep upholding texts that may have seemed hard to challenge the validity of in the past, but have clear flaws and so require serious rigorous revision. This also doesn't come from a place of trying to establish a more 'liberal' Islam and is an attempt to appease Westerners, as fundamentalists argue. The reality is that there has always been dissent against the establishment Islam fostered and shaped by imperial courts, and is more if an attempt to shed and remove the elements of it that are suspect and have often been shown to arise historically from outside the religion's doctrines but from the environment it spread into from Arabia. One of the ironies of fundamentalism is that they attempt to use texts that arose after Islam was influenced by the surrounding religious and ethnic communities to try and gain an understanding of what the Muslim community was like before that intermingling. 

Atrocities that are clearly outlawed in the Quran, such as killing noncombatants, forced conversion etc. are contradicted by some hadith. It takes a lot of weaseling on the part of takfiris to square that circle, and it's always done with transparent lack of real ijtihad or scientific process, while the political goals hiding under the veneer are clear.

On the whole, kharijites and takfiris are dogmatic, they don't care for the science of theology because they are purely reactionary. Fundamentalism as a whole isn't even consistent with the tradition of Islamic theology and diversity of opinion, its a post-colonial attempt to define Islam as a single entity in relation to outside forces, which of course is reflected by some non-Muslim's treatment of it as such.

Of course the issue that is emblematic of this is Sharia, which had never meant a codified and fixed or even particularly strict set of rules and rulings until it various Muslims who saw modernization as a form of cultural colonialism and who were untrained in the Islamic sciences (most were teachers, engineers other technocrats) decided to try and define the religion by the traditionalist practices that the imperial societies who had ruled over them for centuries had established. As this becomes the language of those who have adversarial dialogue with the West, Sharia as conceptualized by these groups and reflected back by those in the West who receive the praise politicized and bastardized understanding of it will then accept whichever version fits their own political needs. It's increasingly clear that both extremist Muslims and extremist anti-Muslims love to collaborate in defining the religion in the most anti-Western way possible, in order to keep at each others' throats regardless of what the majority of modern Muslim scholars may believe or theorize. 

None of this is even getting into the relationship between power and establishment Islam, and the restraints and limitations power puts on how people are allowed to best interpret the religion. The classical example is Saudi. 

Anyways, it's an enormous topic that is mostly historical and political in nature - though early theology is an important aspect of it - and the biggest takeaway for me is that the political aspects of Islam itself are minor compared to it's actually function to the individual human being, and that the political aspects are marred and mangled by the inherent adversity and power dynamics that are at the core of political vision. 

Sorry for the long rant, I actually wrote a longer comment with sources to orientalists like Goldziher and Schacht who studied hadith and those who built on and challenged their views in more recent years, as well as some academic readings from JSTOR (dunno if you have access but planned to provide extracts if you didn't) that I found relevant.

My point was that they do indeed respect and understand national sovereignty. You claim that they don't because they would be upset, but they would still act according to the principle.

&gt; And you said it yourself, they gave their consent. They wanted to be in, they gave their consent and was part of building the 2007 treaty. If they don't like it anymore like us, then negotiate like we are doing, or leave like the UK is doing.

The meaning of which was unilaterally changed. We'll see what they do.

All of these people almost always exist outside the 'tribe' in power economically, and often ethnically.  It's psychologically difficult to get people to care about a perceived 'outside' group, especially if they have very different social norms and if their violence is largely inflicted on each other.  Also keep in mind that America is very large and having 'gang areas' does not really cause much of a problem to the rest of society because it happens in places that nobody cares about and that don't have any economic relevance.  They aren't warring on top of an ocean of oil.

I'm not sure of a good analogy for you.  Let's assume for the sake of the analogy that you don't particularly care for Romani.  Consider how much you would care if Romani lived in some relatively secluded part of Romania that has no economic relevance and they were killing each other, but otherwise not really interacting with the rest of Romanian society.  You simply never encounter them.  It's hard to care about an 'outside' group having 'their own problems'.  You might even resent spending a lot of money and police resources in trying to combat their killing each other over drugs and such, especially when your area has its own problems you'd like that money to be spent on.

Now compare all this to the so-called heroin epidemic in America.  In the past fifteen years or so it has started to largely affect middle- and upper-class white people; generally the dominant tribe.  Suddenly it's a big deal and a lot of resources are being put towards combating it.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7isy50/comparison_of_homicide_rates_of_malm√∂_with_a/dr28g56/,Leitos,1512950704

5130,"I have carefully listened to the arguments it gives. That is why I am against it. 

That change on the Constitution was imposed by the EU, we had to comply as any other member of it would. It is something we assumed when entering the EU.

I did not say they actively want to, I said they did not care if the people in poorer areas were poor or even hungry. You can see that in all the discrimination towards people from Andalusia or Extremadura. God I have seen several nationalist politicians comparing them to Africa in a mocking way. I find very funny the ""we also need Spain to grow"" excuse. Will that be after or before you continue supporting other independentisms within Spain? Because that would be a curious type of diplomacy.

Oh come on, just have a look on twitter regaring any separarist movement and we are considered cultureless, fascist savages. You do no see ""the Spanish Government"" as much as you see ""Spain"", as you see ""the Spaniards"". Apart from that your whole ideology is based on generalizations on the Spaniards.

I said nationalism, not independentism. Nationalism has always been conservative and it jumped on the independentist bandwagon when it could not coerce the government for money anymore to save itself. Anyway, your dear Oriol Junqueras has made a life of repeatedly insulting Spain, specially the south.

There is not a lot of violence in unionist demonstrations. Just the very few exalted ones that compose the Spanish nationalists. Paraphrasing you: idiots are everywhere. More population, more idiots even with the same percentage of them. Falangists are absolutely not a representation of unionism but you seem very eager to generalise about them every oportunity you have.

You are the guys not making sense. You want independence because, allegedly, we drag you down. We are not as sophisticared, literate and democratic as you are. Yet you are heading to economic death. Its just proves how wrong you are.

The demonstration organised by SCC was not fascist. Socialists and even Communists were there. But of course you are saying that because some falagist meatheads tagged along.

 I have read about the accusations of SCC being related to fascist groups and its a load of poor journalistic bullshit. You basically say that one of the founding members has a relationship with Opus Dei and basically stretch that until they are all tagged as nazi child-eaters.

You really should see how those votings against franquism work. I still remember one in Palma where they wanted to change names of streets with franquist references. Thing is that included for them the Catholic Kings, Cristopher Columbus and Salvador Dali. Carmena had to stop one of the projects because they were taking away names of catholic martyrs too. It is not supporting franquism, it is not supporting the very skewed notion of franquism the left and specially nationalists have.

How very clever you have been with your wording there. Yes, majority of SEATS but not of VOTES. You got 48% of the votes and got majority of seats thanks to the fact votes in rural areas count twice as much. It takes more than that to declare independence. Also, the 1-O referendum has no validity, had no control and there were photos of people voting several times or even the voting urns already filled beforehand.

I dont hate you, I do admit though that I hate your ideology. I want to share my homeland and country with the world and people share their land with me. I don't consider you fascist because I do not agree with you, I consider you fascist because your ideology is filled to the top with elements of fascism covered in sparkling good will, pacifism and ""democracy"". You say you don't want to impose anything, too bad because imposition is *intrinsic* in your ideology.

I am sorry but that is how it is, the mere action of disagreeing with catalan nationalism is an offence. ""How can you not see our unbreakable will as a nation?!"", ""You do not understand, its a feeling we have"". You keep acting like if its a supreme plane of existence you have access to but you see we do understand it and we understand that you consider yourselves diferent just because you were born in a random place in the world and that is excuse enough for you to be treated differently.

There are no economic arguments that support you, the last months are undeniable proof of that. There are no historical arguments that support you, there is ample empyrical proof of that. What is left? The ""we are different"" argument. But you are different enough to prefer being alone in the dark than with us and it takes, willing or not, disdain towards us in order to reach that conclusion.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/7it7gm/catalans_cant_agree_on_what_independence_means/dr28juf/,Fenrir395,1512950814

It's not a game. The Dublin Regulation reflects the intent behind this treaty, and that was understood by Poland. The idea that now it all goes out the window and Germany gets to redistribute asylum seekers all over the EU is ridiculous.

Poland's sovereignty will win out, because theirs is the only one that matters in the end when it comes to the internal situation in their own nation.

5359,"I already tried to explain this in other posts in this thread - the problem is that most Czechs don't view the EU as something that should have any authority over us in areas of migration and asylum.

They are willing to swallow when the Czech state introduces, say, new tax policy they don't agree with, because as much as they may not like some specific Czech politicians, they recognize the Czech state as the legitimate authority, no matter whether they're from Prague, Brno, Ostrava or some small village in Southern Bohemia.

But they never recognized that the EU should have the authority to send non-EU nationals over here against our will, because no one ever explained to them that this is what could happen when we signed Lisbon Treaty. Nobody even told them that there is something like common asylum policy in the EU.

Czechs were sold on the idea of the EU by underlining the economic benefits. Thus they overwhelmingly view the EU as a trade union + they appreciate Schengen because it makes their tourist trips easier. Young people know about Erasmus and other educational programmes of the EU, but that's pretty much it.

So when you say, 'but this is what you agreed to, you signed the treaties, this is how the Union works' - well most of our society doesn't understand how the union works, they don't identify with it, they just kind of went along with it because the Czech society is in general quite passive and uninterested in European affairs and so the true state of affairs only appears when there is some controversial decision such as this one. And the true state of affairs is that the Czechs never conciously agreed that this authority should be handed over to the EU, it just happened without them even knowing that it happened.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/7isfbh/czech_pm_designate_eu_should_not_push_us_over/dr1ujmn/,kristynaZ,1512936160

It's a settlement with 9 houses and 15 inhabitants that's part of a larger town of 6000, but is not part of a contiguous urban area, it's about a kilometre out in the forest

During the times of the GDR it was built as habitation for the workers in a factory that produced charcoal briquettes from wood. It became property of the Federal Republic of Germany after unification and was sold as a rental property to 2 private investors.

Those investors never visited the village and simply restricted themselves to collecting rent, causing the houses to be increasingly run-down.

The case attracted attention when the property was put on auction. It has nominal rent revenues of 30 000 a year, but only 16 000 are actually being paid.

It caused some interest as a curiosity and sparked some debate about the obligations of those who own property.

5526,"They were fleeing violent religious extremists more so than the Assad regime. Notice how so many Syrians still support the Syrian Government? They do so because it is better to live under Assad than it is to live under the religious extremists fighting for a theocracy. If Assad did not have support he would be long dead by now and the rebels would be fighting between themselves for power.

Also - Refugee law and international human rights law are closely connected in content but differ in their function. The main difference of their function is the way in which international refugee law considers state sovereignty while international human rights law do not. One of the main aspects of international refugee law is non-refoulement which is the basic idea that a country cannot send back a person to their country of origin if they will face endangerment upon return. In this case, a certain level of sovereignty is taken away from a country. This basic right of non-refoulement conflicts with the basic right of sovereign state to expel any undocumented aliens.

So if it can be guaranteed these people will be safe from persecution from Assad then they will be sent back as Syria needs to rebuild. If people continue to leave Syria it will struggle to rebuild  for a long time. The important part is that a power vacuum hasn't been created like it was in Iraq. Assad is still in power while he is not a democratic leader he is certainly far better alternative to a religious extremist that would have turned Syria into Saudi Arabia/Iran 2.0 Do not mistake the rebels as freedom fighters. The FSA may have been fighting for democracy in the beginning but the belligerents have changed since 2011 and the rebellion was captured by Islamists that sought a theocracy not very different from ISIS' caliphate. 

I also doubt the regime used chemical weapons at least the last time where the US proceeded to bomb Assad after doing that. The reason why is because I've seen the bullshitting before. SWAPO and the MPLA (South African Border War) Said we had used chemical weapons at one point in one of the battles where we attacked their positions yet ""miraculously"" our troops were not affected by the chemical weapons yet they somehow only affected the SWAPO and FAPLA (MPLA) troops and civilians and they said the SADF bayoneted babies yet those claims were completely unfounded. They said that to try and cause outrage among the international community basically it's propaganda with the intent to gather sympathy for one side and seething hatred for the other.

Anyway the Syrian gas attacks stink of the same BS in my opinion. Especially the last one because Assad knew the repercussions of using chemical weapons after Ghouta where the US was on board with invading Syria and conducting regime change like they did in Iraq. And Assad isn't stupid.... He wants to live and maintain his grip on power. He would not risk using chemical weapons on civilian targets not to mention the gas somehow had ""selective"" targeting notice how no one was wearing protection from the gas yet only certain people were dying from it despite dozens of people standing around them. Gas does not dissipate that quickly it contaminates the area for certain time depending on conditions. And even if the gas attacks were real as a conventional air strike did happen on the last gas attack event. The Russians said a building was hit and it is possible that the building had chemical weapons stored inside that were ruptured from the bombs that were dropped. 

Anyway war is confusing as shit. I just don't buy into the BS anymore... the fucking propaganda is everywhere and conducted by all sides. There are two phases to war, the military phase where all the bloody fighting takes place and the political phase where the propaganda, lying and misinformation is spread to discredit the opponent. 

I really find ""incidents"" during war difficult to believe after being lied to so many times like the baby incubators bullshit that was used by the US during the Iraq-Kuwait crisis. The WMD bullshit again used by the US to justify the invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam's regime.

I'm fine with all of those. The problems with Visegrad countries lately are:

-The normalization of conspiracy theories about Soros and the eeeeevul Brussels. If you don't want to be part of the EU, Magyar brothers, so be it. But quit trying to destabilize it from within.

-The questionable regard for the rule of law in Poland.

-Significant issues with demagoguery (I'm intentionally not discussing immigration at all) by politicians like Okamura (if you can't prove your wealth is legit, we'll take it all! I am economically more left-wing, or should I say more committed to left-wing ideals, than most people on here but that is madness)

-A corrupt political class (Babis for instance)

-A very particular definition of Christian/Catholic values in Poland for instance that amounts to more or less spit in the face of the Pope and millions of devout Catholics around the world

Look, I'm fine with nationalism, I'm fine with being religious (religious and royal leaders have been some of the loudest voices standing up to 1930s-style demagogues), I'm fine even with social conservatism so long as it isn't at execute-the-gays levels, and I'm fine with being anti-immigration when your country doesn't have the will or means to integrate migrants from a region that is in the midst of its worst sectarian strife in centuries.

5758,"&gt; So, Malmo, Bratislava, Tallinn would need less immigrants to make its homicide rate closer to Paris?     
         
Why not compare Malmo to Honduras and Brazil? That would make the graph even more disproportionate. Then you can say that immigration is actually reducing the crime in Sweden, because Brazil doesn't have as many immigrants.             
          
The primary factors for Bratislava and Tallinn are different than the primary factors for Malmo. The same way the primary factors causing the Honduras crime rate are different. Slovakia has 3 times lower GDP/capita than Sweden. The countries are not comparable at all. Sweden is comparable to other rich Scandinavian countries. If you want to make the point that immigration isn't a big factor here, compare Malmo to Oslo, Stockholm, and Copenhagen.          
         
               
          
Malmo has a 3 times higher rate compared to Stockholm, could the main reason be that a demographic which according to Swedish statistics is 2-5 times over-represented in violent crime over-represented in Malmo?

5843,"That's not how it works. Actually most economists agree that some immigration is an engine for economic growth and thus job creation. It's actually easy to see why in practice as much as in theory.

Low skill workers don't actually displace locals, but tend to push them up into more lucrative and high paying fields. If you have a small business and you do all the low skill work, you don't exactly have time to do things such as plan, consult and manage your business. Sure, you could hire a local, to help you out but they are more expensive as the demand for low skill work far outweighs the supply. Here is where immigrants come in. That small difference between being able to hire someone or not one has raised millions of businesses in the western world out of obscurity and financial ruin and has added greatly to the overall economy. It also is a greater opportunity for immigrants than they would otherwise have, hence why they immigrate, so it's good for them too. It's a win win.

Now, none of this is a valid reason for **unrestrained** immigration. Again, everyone agrees that too much of it and it has the adverse effects of genuinely pushing wages down and pricing people out of work. Everyone also agrees that in the western world no country is at this point or even close to it, and many country suffer from the lack of immigration or even emigration (Japan, Eastern Europe, etc). But at the end of the day, a country is more than its economy. It's a civil society, and a common sense of identity. No government has the right to sacrifice that in a long run for a higher GDP figure.

Immigration is good, but it must have limits, and the incentives must be in the right place.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/7irfc4/unemployment_rates_october_2017/dr17dl7/,Thodor2s,1512900237

5953,"Greenpeace designates your source as ""a Russian energy propaganda site"". Given the Russian government's history of constant pathological lying about scandals they are likely involved in, or even for no reason whatsoever, I am inclined to believe them. 

This includes Russia's latest ""satellite"" theory, which has already been rejected by the IAEA, because no satellite containing ruthenium-106 fell to earth during the period in question. This means that the Russian government is lying ***again***. The international community has lost count.

&gt; #The mysterious radioactive cloud‚Äîwhy the ruthenium-106 story matters

&gt; A week ago, the Russian meteorological service, Roshydromet, reacted to a month-long standing request for information from Greenpeace. It triggered extraordinary interest among journalists world-wide in a rather unknown bit of nuclear physics: the radioactive substance [ruthenium-106](http://www.greenpeace.org/russia/en/news/nuclear-1121/).

&gt; For weeks, two Russian state-run bodies, Rosatom and Roshydromet, made statements negating or misinterpreting each other‚Äôs information and the data coming from French and German sources. The International Atomic Energy Agency ‚Äì the UN body in which all nuclear states are supposed to cooperate ‚Äì did not give any clarity, and only a Russian energy propaganda site leaked what looks like the IAEA‚Äôs [measurement data](http://geoenergetics.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Summary_of_Ru-106_measurements_in_Europe_at_2017-10-13_at_1900_UTC_UTC_Technical_Attachment-2.pdf). The Russian disinformation services were working overtime over social and even official media, making denial statements and sometimes pointing the finger to France and the Ukraine. In other words, there is no reliable information on where the cloud of this rare man-made radioactive substance came from.

&gt; The only thing that is clear, is that at its source there must have been a lot of it ‚Äì sufficient, [according to the French nuclear research institute IRSN](http://www.irsn.fr/EN/newsroom/News/Documents/IRSN_Information-Report_Ruthenium-106-in-europe_20171109.pdf), to activate precautionary measures for some kilometres around. The scary thing is that we still don‚Äôt know what caused it. Speculation abounds: medical waste burned in an incinerator? Or an incident in the recently started new vitrification plant in the nuclear reprocessing facility, Mayak, or [like in 2001 in a similar installation in France](http://www.nuclear-transparency-watch.eu/activities/nuclear-emergency-preparedness-and-response/strong-secret-radioactive-release-in-russia-analysis-of-the-french-association-for-control-of-radioactivity-in-the-west-acro.html)? We know it was no satellite and no nuclear power plant.

&gt; The Russian nuclear giant Rosatom has a legacy of denying accidents at nuclear facilities and radiation pollution: The explosion at Mayak (also known as the Kyshtym disaster) in 1957 and [continuous contamination of the area](http://www.greenpeace.org/hungary/PageFiles/762727/Rosatoms_Mayak_more_reprocessing_more_contamination.pdf) in the South Urals; the Chernobyl catastrophe that was denied in the first days, and the effects of which [last until today](http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/Campaign-reports/Nuclear-reports/Nuclear-Scars/); [the 1993 explosion at the Siberian Chemical Combine](http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/p060_scr.pdf) where, among other isotopes, the same ruthenium-106 was released into the atmosphere and about 2000 people were contaminated. The emergency situation in 2007 at Mayak resulted in the radioactive contamination of water; and many other incidents. In these cases, the event was immediately denied, then later reluctantly admitted after denial had become impossible.

&gt; Earlier this year, we saw [similar denial and disinformation](http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2017-03-new-radioactive-iodine-detected-in-norway-and-finland-%C2-more-breaking-fake-news-likely-to-follow) when particulate Iodine-131 was measured all over Europe and IRSN could only conclude the source was [‚Äúlikely situated in Eastern Europe‚Äù](http://www.irsn.fr/EN/newsroom/News/Pages/20170411_Radioactive-iodine-detected-early-2017-in-Europe-not-related-to-incident-of-October-2016-in-Halden-Norway.aspx).

&gt; Rosatom is building, or is planning to build, nuclear power plants in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America. It boasts a portfolio worth some $133 billion. We need a high level of safety culture: full transparency, immediate cooperation with regulatory authorities, the IAEA, international partners and competitors, whistleblower protection, and attention and care for the potential victims.

&gt; Rosatom has done nothing to demonstrate it is a responsible actor. No early and constructive publication of measurement data, no constructive analysis of what the source could be. Only denial, diversion of attention, and shooting at the messenger. In order to get more clarity, Greenpeace saw no other possibility than to request an investigation from the public prosecutor. The fact that the source of this ruthenium-106 emission remains a mystery is a reason for concern in itself. But the fact that Rosatom, one of the largest nuclear operators in the world, reacts as it did makes it really scary.

&gt; Jan Haverkamp is nuclear expert consultant at Greenpeace Central and Eastern Europe.

&gt; Andrey Allakhverdov is press secretary of the Greenpeace CEE nuclear project.

5985,"Your belief in following whatever you want is relativism. My problem with relativism is that it is very loosey goosey and as the name implies has little to no objective basis.

I would say reality is objective in every form including the spiritual. There is a force called gravity even if I do not believe in it. Either a religion is right or wrong there is no imbetween. There cannot be one God, no God, and many gods at the same time just because I believe a certain thing.

Since reality is objective which means there either is or isn't a God then that means there is a right and a wrong as there has to be a truth. If there is a God who wants to have a relationship with human beings then there MUST be an absolute way to accept Him or reject Him. As in all relationships the two parties have to agree. This is where organized religion comes in to guide people into getting communion with God, with varying degrees of sucess.

The reason I follow an organized religion like Catholicism is that there is an objective clarity to it. It doesn't hold every answer and I probably will never get an answer to all my questions but there is a reality to it. I believe it is the best guide out of every religion. In it I (a very finite human being) do not define what is right and wrong and being finite in an objective universe is precisely why I should have no say in what it right and wrong.

A false religion is one that is made up by the individual because it relies solely on one's feelings and reason. You have to admit that a group of people that have had thousands of years to contemplate, meditate, reason, and be divinely inspired is more credible than an individually made up religion. I believe that Jesus Christ, God Himself, created my Church so I personally trust it.

While you are right that communism is not to be equated with atheism some of the logic behind the ideology has to do with the end of religion. ""Religion is the opiate of the masses"" said Marx in the Communist Manifesto. In the ideology of communism the world revolves around class and two of the biggest perpetrators to the problem of classism is capitalism and religion. It wasn't just the Soviets who attempted to smother religion but other communist regimes as well like Pol pot's Khmer Rouge that attacked and sacked Buddhist temples and Maoist China which banned some religions because they were a distraction to the state. Some of these instances of violence was caused by atheists taking Marxist teachings to the extremes to get rid of ""the opiate of the masses"".",,/r/europe/comments/7imasb/polands_incoming_prime_minister_my_dream_is_to/dr157lu/,Catholic_Crusader,1512894036
