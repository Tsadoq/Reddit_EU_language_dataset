And yes I’m general the idea is:

If: Casualties from deploying troops &gt; number of casualties from jihadis= dumb move.

If: casualties from deploying troops &lt; number of casualties from jihadis= justifiable move. 

So far, twenty years of data suggests that this is a dumb move. 

And at any rate, the idea with Hitler was less, “well he was tactically impaired and this guy is not,” and more, “destabilizing geopolitical situations invites worse by allowing pre previously understood or controlled elements to become uncontrolled/ not understood.

There will be no world-scale invasion where one country or group of countries attempt to establish global dominance. World War 2 was completely different than what this is.

Just as PTSD, veteran suicides and cripple veterans were a problem after WW2, Vietnam and Soviet-Afghan War (among literally any other war), it is going to remain a problem in any modern conflict and on both sides. Yeah, we can recoil in horror when it happens to a first world country, but it's nothing out of the ordinary when it comes to these wars. The difference is, as much as the US is criticized, it's still a democratic nation with free speech, which will see reports of these issues much more then from a semi-authoritarian nation like Russia or a full on-authoritarian state like Syria.

When we ignore that, we can see that in the end both the Taliban and ISIL/ISIS remain crippled, both the Afghan and Iraqi armies were restructured and are no longer in shambles. Yes, new fighters emerged, and were destroyed just as the ones prior. Yes, war crimes happened, but in most cased the perpetrators were punished. 

And when we look at Syria, I'm with you on Trumps retardation when it came to leaving the Kurds to their fate against the Turks. I can kinda see why he'd do that, as Turkey is a much more valuable ally then YPG, but it's still a move of cowardice and his ""hot takes"" on the conflict are straight up retarded. But at the same time Syria defined a new way how the US fought - special forces and drones, and less conventional army units. 

As for the *military-industrial complex* and *politicians whine about how a single payer healthcare system is impossible*, it's more of a problem with the US government then with the operations it conducts. Unlike something like the Ukraine conflict, these operations do not hamper the US nearly enough thanks to their (comparatively, as despite being the largest cash wise, it's still not overly huge percentage wise) ridiculous defense budget. 

Anyways, you're points are valid as well, and I mostly wished to explain why I stand by my opinion that my short response most likely did not encapsulate.",中華民國將復活!,/r/europe/comments/ejbzk2/when_you_wake_up_at_7am_as_a_european/fcx5t82/,RifleSoldier,1578052445

It's been all over the news, (and we saw it ourselves too, that Americans with those ""freedom fighters"" from Chechnya travelling to Syria), but even US congresswoman and presidenttial candidate Tulsi Gabbard says it herself:   
   
gabbard.house.gov/news/StopArmingTerrorists  
    
You should google it yourself, although the US gov't has been deleting a lot of it online there's still ton of stuff about it online.    
   
&gt;They have not that is Turkish propaganda and has literally been denied by the united nations.    
    
Just because you take everything said by the Western media as ""fact"" and everything else ""propaganda"" doesn't mean it's true. The Western media also propagates to push an agenda and doesn't show you the genocidal killings in Syria by Kurds in Syria by displacing/forcing out and killing the Arab (especially Alawites, Shia Muslims), Turkmen, Assyrian populations in the area. Turkmens there, for instance, have been there since before the crusades.  
   
You're buying a lot of propaganda yourself and it's funny you refer to UN now while supporting Haftar who's fighting the UN recognized government of Libya.   
   
The agenda they're pushing is to take out lands from sovereign countries and create a Kurdistan to destabilize the region and create another puppet regime while denying Crimeans and eastern Ukranians, for example, the same right to self-determinate because they want to unify with Russia. Also denying any rights to Palestinians.   
   
Personally I don't care if Kurds of Turkey went there (left cities like Istanbul) and joined their compatriots in Syria and Iraq to form a Kurdistan, personally I find borders stupid and shouldn't exist (as they won't in the future) and I think everyone should have their right to self-determine, but it doesn't seem like Turkish Kurds really like the Western idea of doing that. 
 
&gt;The SDF has tens of thousands of arab fighters.    
    
Turkish army also has tens of thousands of Kurdish citizens. And Kurds of Turkey hate PKK and Syrian Kurds. Ever spoken to any of them? Turkey has about 15-20 million citizens of Kurdish origin (most of whom unfortunately vote for Erdogan, ironically, a fact by the way) and most of the live in big cities in Turkey's West (like Istanbul which has more Kurds than Syria alone).

317,"Month and a half of intense conversations and strips and loosening between the negotiating teams of the PSOE and Esquerra Republicana, piloted by Pedro Sánchez and Pere Aragonès, culminated yesterday in the public diffusion of the agreement reached between the two formations.  The pact, black on white, takes shape in just one and a half pages.  But the document has a significant political effect: Sánchez opens the channel for the first time to hold a consultation with the citizens of Catalonia to ratify the agreements that can be reached at the bilateral table between the governments of Spain and Catalonia, which will be constituted immediately.  though still without a deadline, to overcome the ""political conflict"".

 The agreement, which was endorsed last night by the ERC national council and which today will be unanimously ratified by the federal executive of the PSOE, definitely slams Sánchez's inauguration in the second vote, which will conclude the plenary of the Congress on Tuesday.  The guaranteed abstention of the 13 members of the Left in the investiture will, in turn, allow the formation of the first coalition government since the restoration of democracy in Spain, between the PSOE and Unidas Podemos


Despite the ambiguity, the agreement goes far beyond the bases laid down in Pedralbes in December 2018.  The signatories of the agreement - the PSOE and the PSC on the one hand, and the Left on the other - say that ""we are facing the opportunity to unblock and direct the political conflict over the future of Catalonia and to lay the groundwork for its resolution"".  Both sides also recognize that ""there is a desire for dialogue to reach an agreement that will allow us to overcome the current situation"".  Recognizing this opportunity, together with the ""political will and firmness"" of both parties, according to the preface of the document, ""allow exploring and addressing the opening of a new stage based on effective, open and sincere dialogue, and opting for recognition and  institutional understanding. ""

 The agreement, which claims to be anchored in ""the principles of institutional loyalty and bilaterality that govern the political framework of relationship between the Government of Spain and the Government of the Generalitat de Catalunya"", consists of only two points.  The first emphasizes the recognition that ""there is a conflict of a political nature in relation to the political future of Catalonia"".  And that conflict ""can only be resolved through democratic means, through dialogue, negotiation and agreement, overcoming the judicialization of the same.""  That is, by activating the political path and without the only recourse to the courts of law that the Socialists reproach the seven-year term of Mariano Rajoy's term, which led to the application of Article 155 of the Constitution in Catalonia, although  with the competition of the PSOE.

The second point of the agreement, however, is the determinant.  He is the one who announces the commitment to create a ""bilateral table of dialogue, negotiation and agreement between governments"", to try to redouble the situation and overcome the political conflict.  Said table, according to the document, ""will start from the recognition and legitimacy of all the parties and proposals"".  And ""it will act without limits other than respecting the instruments and principles governing the democratic legal system.""  Any express reference to the Constitution in the document, as well as to self-determination, is bypassed.

 The bilateral table between governments, ""as a political instrument"", will be based on the four legs defined by Aragonès in an article in La Vanguardia.  The first is the composition: at the table will be representatives of the Governments of Spain and Catalonia, without explicit mention of the Presidents.  ""Delegations will be established on a parity basis and with members who decide on both sides,"" the document states.

The second leg refers to the content, in which there will be no vetoes and, therefore, the Government of the Generalitat will be able to put on the table the self-determination of Catalonia or the amnesty for those convicted of the process, as set out in the agreement.  of the Government of October 22 following the ruling of 1-O.  ""Open dialogue on all proposals submitted,"" the agreement guarantees.  ""All parties will freely submit their detailed proposals for the future of Catalonia.  And positions on each proposal will be evaluated, debated and argued, ""he says.

 The calendar of the government table, the third leg, will be ""transparent"".  It will begin its work, according to the agreement, ""within fifteen days from the formation of the government of Spain, and will establish specific deadlines for its meetings and to present its conclusions"".  The document, therefore, does not set a maximum deadline or time limit for the conclusion of the table negotiations.  The claim, in any case, is that it be confined to the current legislature.  Although the fourth leg sets out guarantees and follow-up: ""the table will establish mechanisms to guarantee the start and maintenance of its activity and the fulfillment of agreements"".

The document signed by socialists and Republicans concludes with the real crux of the matter, the keystone of the agreement: the final citizen consultation.  And at that table, according to the document, ""agreements must be sought that have the full support of Catalan society"".  And so both parties ""are committed to promoting the effectiveness of agreements that are adopted through appropriate procedures.""  ""The measures in which the agreements are materialized will be subject to democratic validation through consultation with the citizens of Catalonia, in accordance with the mechanisms provided or that may be provided for in the framework of the legal and political system,"" the paragraph states.  most important of the document.  It is necessary to take into account the safeguard - ""where applicable"", but also that mechanisms of consultation are not contemplated in the current legal system.

 However, this table between governments, according to the document, will ""be coordinated"" with other existing institutional and parliamentary dialogues, ""which must be strengthened"", with reference to the bilateral Generalitat-State commission and the Table of Parties formed in the  Parliament, at the request of the PSC.

 ERC has imposed its times and to the required distance.  The document does not carry the logo of any of the signatory parties, and although the communications of Republicans and PSOEs followed the same script, they focused on different elements.  ERC, simply in the ""consultation to the citizenship"";  the PSOE, in the procedures that can be foreseen within the framework of the legal and political system.

Imagine if Iran had detonated a car bomb in and killed the commander of Central Command, would you feel too scared to continue?  Would you feel like the US should just leave the Middle East and not dare invoke the wrath of surprise bombings? No?  Of course not.  You'd be mad as hell as insist someone else go fight and die for you.  That's exactly how they think as well, they are not scared of our bombs so hut the fuck up with this God Damn nonsense.

It has been nearly FORTY FUCKING YEARS since we deployed the first modern guided bombs.  We have been dropping precision bombs in the Middle East since the Gulf War.  Just how much fucking longer will it take for you people to get the idea that they aren't scared of these weapons and they aren't going to be deterred by them.  They aren't cowards, they've accepted a bomb from the sky can be their fate at any time, and they are still willing to fight.

One of the greatest mysteries of my life as someone who has spent 10 years in the Army, all of them during war time, is how the fuck people can still talk about how great and strong we are and how we just need to flex some muscle to make our enemies run home.  This is fucking absurd.  I'm sorry dude but you need to learn some God Damn humility, it doesn't matter how powerful you think the US military is, it cannot do everything and it cannot simply scare the ""bad guy"" away.  This insane policy of primarily relying on force to achieve our goals has lasted nearly two decades in the Middle East and we have accomplished ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOTHING but here you are thinking a single bombing is going to make them feel the need to run and hide to ""live the rest of their lives in a tunnel.""

You remember ""Shock and Awe"" during the 2003 invasion of Iraq?  Nearly 20 years ago we were talking about defeating the enemy by shocking them with our amazing air power, are they shocked yet?  We've dropped thousands and thousands of these bombs in the Middle East, we're miles and miles and miles beyond any kind of surprise or ""shock"" that we have this capability.  Dropping bombs is routine, its just how things go, its not surprising, shocking, unexpected, or anything else.  The US military has been a one trick pony since the Gulf War, and we still haven't figured out no one is impressed by it anymore.

The thing with immigration is that it can serve as a short term cure, but comes with its own long term problems. First, immigrant fertility rates tend to match the natives within a generation or two. Second, it tends to take a generation or two for the average immigrant family to acquire the skills and capital to be contributing large amounts of taxes (at which point their fertility rates drop off anyway). And finally, perhaps most importantly, there are many people concerned about the amount, type and speed of immigration into their countries which limits the amount of people we can realistically integrate.

Try Cologne.


&gt;Hamburg which is the 2nd busiest train station in Europe with just 8 intercity platforms 

Actually only 4.

The only exceptions are trains going to or coming from Copenhagen and trains changing directions and going to or coming from Lübeck.

More platforms doesn't always mean better. Thanks to having 25 platforms, frankfurts track situation is so complex that sorting the trains takes an eternity.

Since you work in the US for instance there is the time where a state in the south tried making it harder for immigrants to work there in an attempt to help the local population getting more jobs. This backfired as a lot of farmers couldnt find the necessary workers anymore to pick the fruit and it either started to rot on the trees or the farmers employed workers illegally. No local people rushed in to take the jobs as they were hard and low paying and they were often not as efficient as immigrants had been. The laws were soon reversed.

Of course its not great that many of the jobs going to immigrants are underpaid and hard but I guess to a degree you have to see it in relation to what they were used to before. A worker that gets little pay here still gets more than he would have at home and has enough to send some to the family and support them as well.

Had that been the law in 1898 the Maine would never have gone to Havana Harbor. She never would have been blown up. There would have been no war with Spain with its attendant loss of life. Two hundred miles is ample, in the opinion of experts, for defense purposes. Our nation cannot start an offensive war if its ships can't go further than 200 miles from the coastline. Planes might be permitted to go as far as 500 miles from the coast for purposes of reconnaissance. And the army should never leave the territorial limits of our nation.

483,"&gt;The largest Ruhrgebiet city it stops in is Osnabrück

Because you're taking the wrong train. 

The direct train Amsterdam-Berlin (IC Line 77) is what's called a Heckeneilzug and is only Intercity in name, Offroad-Interregio in practice. While currently not possible due to major timetable restructurings caused by preparations for major repairs and reorganizations, it's normally faster to take the ICE (terminal station Frankfurt) into the Ruhrgebiet and then change. Hell, even with this connection currently being busted, it's still faster to change out of this IC in Hannover and into an ICE to Berlin, because it will overtake the direct IC.

There are talks to upgrade it to a proper line, but neither NS nor DB have made substantial advancements.

&gt;Where is the ICE that stops only in Amsterdam, Osnabrück, Hannover and Berlin? That could truly rival the airplane.

Not marketable. North Rhine-Westphalia and by extension lower saxony pretty much in its entirety is overloaded and a massive delay hotspot. Fast connections are therefore primarily reserved for the truly big traffic flows such as Cologne/Ruhrgebiet-Hamburg, Cologne/Ruhrgebiet - Berlin, Ruhrgebiet-Frankfurt, Cologne-Bruxelles/Amsterdam. After that, local transport is sorted around those. After that come basically Scrap collectors which stop everywhere where a fast local into main line connection isn't possible for their directon, like Cologne-Leipzig, Cologne-Emden, Cologne-Norddeich, Aachen-Berlin, Amsterdam-Berlin etc.

Taking one of the main load spots out for an Amsterdam-Berlin-Line that misses half the important Cities but still takes up a spot on the chokepoints like Osnabrück-Hannover isn't reasonable for the profit-oriented, private company that DB is. Also these trains have to fit into the hour-standard-time imposed by NS, so they rank even lower in the timetable priority.",,/r/europe/comments/eiycie/germany_cuts_fares_for_longdistance_rail_travel/fcwju2h/,LightningEnex,1578027580

On six pages, she thoroughly explained the absurdity of parents' demands. Referring to religious beliefs, she pointed out that the Catholic Church never issued an official position on a series of books about the adventures of magicians. She also cited positive reviews of people associated with the Church, including Fr.. Janusz Królikowski from the Pontifical Academy of Theology in Krakow, who simply said that:

* reading Harry Potter books is not dangerous;
* children can distinguish fiction from reality;
* and many examples of attitudes presented in the book have an undoubted educational value.

Polonists also pointed out that the inclusion of ""Harry Potter"" in the list of reading took place at the request of the children themselves, and discussing readings close to their interests allows you to fight reluctance to read and raises students' competences. They also emphasized

&gt;**educational values ​​of reading, among others** **the value of friendship, love and loyalty, and the equality aspect - not dividing students due to their origin and material status.**

Despite this, ""for the good of the children"", the teaching staff and management decided that ""Harry Potter"" would disappear from the reading list.

""Respecting the right of parents to raise children according to their own worldview and religious beliefs, we are terrified by what discussions the children were drawn into,"" they wrote.

Our green energy sources (not just wind power) might produce electricity that amounts to around half of our consumption of energy. But that is not the same as saying that half of our energy **usage** can be traced back to green sources. In theory, you could produce 100% of the energy consumption from wind, while at the same time producing another 100% from coal. Reducing black energy production and usage is what matters.

Lots of that green energy gets wasted, especially during night time and during storms. So we still rely allot on black energy.

A better way to measure the impact would be to look at the actual emissions, they are still higher than most other countries in the world. To what extent our 'green' energy actually reduces black energy production, is much harder to say. Sometimes it gets exported to other countries. Also, our economy also relies allot on shipping, which requires oil. And most other countries won't be able to rely as much on the wind.

Lisów - a dangerous precedent

Parents of students from Lisów supported art. 48 of the Constitution, which speaks of the right to raise children in accordance with their beliefs. In this situation, however, the interference limits were exceeded. Parents demanded a correction in the didactic program, which according to the law on education depends on the teacher.

""The teacher in Poland in the field of teaching has full autonomy, and its support is the core curriculum. It indicates what the teacher must accomplish, and the rest of the content can be freely expanded.

Parents sending their children to school naturally rely on the teacher's qualifications and wisdom. ""

\- explains [OKO.press](https://OKO.press) Anna Schmidt-Fic, a teacher from Poznań, a member of the group ""Protest with an exclamation mark"".

The rigid boundaries between didactics and upbringing guarantee the functioning of the school. ""Let's imagine that a parent has the right to change every element of the didactic program. For some, Harry Potter disturbs, for others evolution, others would prefer to erase a few complicated characters from history.

In this way, we will come to the point where students under the covers with flashlights will gain knowledge from forbidden books, and the teacher will be on a leash of beliefs and parents' vision ”

\- adds Schmidt-Fic.

Teacher, courage!

The discussion about Lisów warmed up teacher's online forums . They believe that school should not bow to the absurd demands of parents. Schmidt-Fic is convinced that the decision of the management and the teaching staff was largely influenced by the political situation.

""Every now and then we receive aggressive messages from the Ministry of Education and school superintendents that threaten with controls and encourage parents to censor teachers"" - explains the teacher and adds that she is afraid that similar situations will antagonize teachers and parents who should work together.

""Parents are increasingly questioning the selection of textbooks and individual teacher decisions. We meet with this every day. We must clearly define the limits of interference, but at the same time show fields of cooperation. Educational issues are the ones where real dialogue should take place, ""explains Schmidt-Fic.

And he demands courage from teachers. ""School cannot afford booms today. We must defend what has not been broken after the reform.

One of these values ​​is undoubtedly the teaching autonomy that allows educating young people with respect for the past, but above all for the future. Let's not take it away. """,,/r/europe/comments/ej8slk/parents_harry_potter_infects_the_souls_of/fcw89n9/,bm52oc,1578019416

&gt;this is just the culmination of it

I think this is the right answer. much of your world view, either slowly or rapidly just lead to one thing or another and it set off this.   
but I am still confused about this part: 

&gt;because French Citizens don't usually die in American custody, that's an oddity, than I read he was of Angolan origin and that clicked in an extremely negative way

what do you mean ""clicked""? why was an Angolan origin French citizen even in ICE custody? do you mean you understood why he was there or did you mean you felt connected to him because you are part- black?   


&gt;you who say it's ""just a statistics""

but you too are just using statistics. him being french, him being Angolan and therefore ""closer"" to you. what you are doing is exactly what we are doing. you say you have a problem with the anglosphere, etc. those are all descriptions/statistics of the person that makes you emotional- the same way we may not find it emotional as it is not close but ""far"" from our understanding.   


&gt;This man died after being imprisoned and no one knows anything.

but that's not true- is it? its not that a man died. its that a french citizen of Angolan origin died in an Anglo- country.  for sure if he died in Angola- this would not be in the news- nor would you care. in fact- i will say that both of us will forget about this news before the new day comes tomorrow.   


and in fact you are correct. I am american, and i am not black. I do not really feel any kind of kinship with the dead guy nor would i shed even emotional tears of his passing- like you may. but you are correct in that given this thread alone- you are one of the more compassionate commenters here. but that doesnt mean others are heartless all the time. i remember last time, 2 Norwegians were beheaded in north africa and this thread was all gloomy and dread. mostly because then most people in this thread could be related more to the dead- just like you can currently. so understand that most people do have more kinship with others like themself. you are not in any way special for feel like this for a fellow countrymen. most other people in this thread would feel the same way if it was their race or nationality rather than yours.",,/r/europe/comments/ej2t5e/a_french_man_has_died_while_at_a_hospital_in_ice/fcw9qxf/,JoeWelburg,1578020402

The mail is primarily processed by night, so it'll be flown up the following morning. That way it might take an extra day (or delivered the same day, I've had both happen), but that's that. 

  For Svalbard it gets processed once more in the northern Norwegian city of Tromsø*, before being flown out to the islands, but seeing as there is little mail and the flight duration is a little over 90 minutes, the mail shouldn't take more than a day extra or be delivered that day.

677,"Both you and the person you're replying to misunderstand how the index works. HDI (Human Development Index) is a value that is derived from how rich, educated, and healthy people in a country are. It was invented in 1990 and is used by the UN and many other entities as the most accurate proxy for quality of life in a country. 

One critisism of the index was that it didnt account for inequality. If for example two countries had the same the HDI score, but the one country had more inequality than the other; then you would expect the country with less inequality to have a better standard of living. Because an extra dollar improves the standard of living for a poor person far more than that dollar would improve it for a rich person. So in 2010 the world started using the IHDI (Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index) instead as a more accurate proxy.

For example, the UK and the US have the exact same HDI score of 0.920. The UK has a moderate amout of inequality, while the US has a great deal of inequality. So when adjusted for inequality the UK gets a IDHI score of 0.845, and the US drops down all the way to a IHDI score of 0.796. This shows the usefullness of the adjustment because brits pretty clearly have a higher stardard of living than americans do, which is reflected in the different IHDI scores.

The index doesn't give scores based on inequality, inequality just modifies the original score. For example Ukraine has less inequality than the US or the UK, but it is also poorer, has worse healthcare, and worse education than both; so it has a HDI score of 0.750 and an IHDI score of 0.701.",,/r/europe/comments/eci0sy/ihdi_by_country_data_collected_in_2018_published/fcvvc0w/,Joeyon,1578010928

2. They gave a yearly bonus to 1.5m people that actually needed it, which the current government reduced to just 300k people.

3. Unemployment levels were lower.

4. They expanded what's called ""Μεταφορικό Ισοδύναμο"" by adding more islands to it, which allowed the residents of those islands to travel and the businesses to make orders at half the price of what they used to pay before. Again, this was cancelled for many islands two days ago, by the current government.

5. They drastically improved hospitals on islands, by hiring much more doctors and adding new machines.
To be exact, the number of doctors in my island was almost doubled, and we also got a kidney unit, which was extremely helpful for people who had to travel to Athens to have access to that kind of machines.

6. Tourism, which is one of our main sources of income, was improved as well.

7. They made the media actually pay for their licenses, which hadn't been paid since forever.

&gt;ICE has expanded the number of people it detains to record levels under President Donald Trump. The peak came this summer, when around 55,000 immigrants were in custody in local jails and private prisons across the country. As of mid-December, the agency was detaining nearly 42,000 immigrants in custody.

There's unsavory rumors of what's done in those private prisons and detention camps.

921,"The C919 has just over 300 orders, almost all of them from China (it does, however, have another 700 options). I do suspect it will disrupt the Chinese market but it will struggle to go global. There is a tendency by companies to deploy streamlined fleets with minimum diversity in order to minimize maintenance and training costs. Switches from Beoing to Airbus and vice-versa exist but are increasingly rare disruptions. Furthermore, after betting in airlines going big with the A380, Airbus now hedges its bets on increasing numbers of long-distance flights using the A321 or long-range versions of the A320. This seems to be partially coming true. For example, the coast-to-coast US market [has all but ditched larger planes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-airlines-shift-to-smaller-jets-for-many-domestic-flights-1429119094) in favour of A320s and B737s.

In this new economy the A320's longer range (6400 km vs 4100 km for the Comac and 5500 km for the B737) is a winner.

How is Airbus production impacted negatively by the 737 debacle? Does not make sense to me at all.

Airbus is speeding up its plans to build a new assembly line of A320 that is supposed to be ready by 2021 adding a 10 to 15% additional capacity. While I don't argue that Airbus will not be able to soak up all the demand if the 737 keeps grounded for the foreseable future, it is definitely helping with shifting the market shares durably in favor of the A320 especially thanks to the higher capacity segment with the A321 and the longer range as you mentionned with the XLR- both having basically no competition.",France,/r/europe/comments/eiw8i8/airbus_beats_delivery_targets_surpasses_boeing_by/fcuhh43/,forsakenMule,1577981063

But I certainly also read articles online.

The negative outview on the aviation industry's growth if Boeing continues to struggle (if the 737 Max won't be recertified for example) was shared in a statement by the CEO (or CFO/chief salesman?) of Airbus a couple of months ago. The newspaper's analysis was that both parties are comfortable in the duopoly and prefer to merely compete for the dominant position. A severe crisis of either Boeing or Airbus would endanger the extremely advantageous market position both companies find themselves in. Basically they prefer to fight over who can skim the most cream.

Other parts are just factual reports I read over the course of the year. Boeing continued to produce 42 737 Max a month from April to the end of December which are all awaiting recertification. Airlines still want these planes for the fuel advantages they offer and it is only logical that airlines currently possess a strong negotiating position which could result in massive rabates.

1160,"&gt; That poster is hilarious with how all South American nations on it were invaded by the USA

If you're remotely interested in opposition to those interventions, there is a famous speech/book called ""War Is a Racket"" by Marine Corps General Smedley Butler that was published in 1935.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Is_a_Racket

He was involved in the Banana Wars and had some scathing critiques of what he was ordered to do:

""I spent thirty-three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country's most agile military force, the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major-General. And during that period, I spent most of my time being a high class muscle-man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the Bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.""

""I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.""",,/r/europe/comments/eivi8t/the_fight_for_freedom_1942_poster/fcu6270/,Ericovich,1577973436

1251,"&gt; Energy consumption in Germany is actually decreasing, due to energy conservation but mostly to moving factories to other countries

There was a slight drop from 2013 to 2014 after which it has stayed about the same [There was a slight drop from 2013 to 2014 after which it has stayed about the same ](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/164149/umfrage/netto-stromverbrauch-in-deutschland-seit-1999/) 

&gt; ⁠Gas consumption is increasing

According to the source from OP the share of gas increased from 8.2% (2018) to 10.5% (2019), yes. But if you look at the overall trend, the share of gas started at 8.0% in 2002, increased in 12.1% in 2008, then fell to 5.5% in 2015 before it went upwards again until today. I would not sum that up as „Gas consumption is increasing“. Renewables on the other hand steadily increased from 8% in 2002 to almost 50% today. 

&gt; Of course, brandishing hyperboles is rarely an efficient manner to comprehend a question.

Yeah, I was a bit angry about the „anti-nuclear are the anti-vaxxers of energy“ comments in this thread, because I think those are beyond ridiculous and don’t contribute anything to actually finding a solution.

Yes. But their are not Indo-European, they are originally from Central Asia.


&gt; Finns and Estonians are the most blonde blue people in the world so I dont get your point, especially when you look at brown skinned dark haired romanians.




So Spain, Italy and Greece shouldn't be in the EU  either?



&gt; Also Gypsies speak an Indo-European language, so by your logic, gypsies are European if Romanians are Eurpean.



Gypsies are Asian nomads who came from India and Pakistan. They are not Europeans.


We are European people.



&gt; Romania was a shithole 100s of years before communism



Oh please! We were far from a shithole! Yes the life wasn't perfect and we were still poor compared to the West but still.



&gt; during communism and after communism. 



During communism yes. But that's just because we had a stupid peasant with 4 classes who believed that paying back external debt is exactly like paying a loan shark.



After communism. Yes the 90s were awful but we came a long way since then. 


We still have problems with corruption and lack infrastructure but we are not a shithole.



&gt; Many countries in Eastern Europe had communism and they are still not as shit as Romania.


Oh come on! Bulgaria, Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, North Macedonia,  Albania,  Moldova, Ukraine and Belarus are way worse than Romania! 





&gt;  Romanians are a shitty people and shitty country



Maybe. But we did came a long way from the 90s and we are nowhere near as bad as the third world African countries you're comparing us with.


&gt; and culturally we have more in common with Turkey than Europe



No we don't! Some Ottoman influence here and there doesn't mean we are related to the Turks. 

By your logic the whole Balkan peninsula (including Greece) is Turkic and not European.



&gt; even by appearance, Romanians look like Turks and not Europeans.




Bitch please! We are white as shit and we are mistaken more often for slavs than turks.

Absolutely not. This is total bullshit.

We are talking about 1939, not 1944. In 1939 Stalin wanted to make somekind of ""mutual assistance pact"" that included all nations west of them, he wanted from western powers approval to enter them in case of German attack at any of them. Basically he wanted legal reason for invasion of free countries in 1939, without any guarantee he will fight with Germany after that. If UK and France would agree on that, he would invade Poland 1st Sep (wouldn't have to pretend he waited until ""Poland was destroyed""), wouldn't have to organise phony elections in Baltic States, but would straight up enter their territory.

First- Copts are absolutely culturally distinct from Muslim Egyptians hahaha. What kind of ignorant statement is that?? It's like you've never met Copts or Muslims in your life and live in some childish fantasy where everyone in Egypt is wearing the nemes headdress and singing kumbaya. Copts are an ethnoreligious group. Literally all of their daily religious customs differ from Muslims and the vast majority do not intermarry across groups. Which leads to the fact that: 

Copts are genetically distinct from Muslim Egyptians. This is a fact illustrated by every available genetic study. If you don't know about it, you're either lying, or just plain ignorant. I'm on vacation and can't be bothered to dig up studies. Since you have free time, go and do your own research. Even 23andme gives a separate figure for Coptic and Egyptian ffs. I only got 4% Coptic according to them. Anyway it's totally obvious if you look at any cluster plot that Copts cluster in a distinct group separately from Muslim Egyptians. 

As for the rest of your comment, it's childish garbage. Seruously it's like talking to a little kid. You're fascist. *No, you!*

You are so fucking intellectually lazy it's unbelievable. Egyptians were not the least to agree to the artificial borders question in the poll. They were in the top 5 or 6 least pan Arabist respondents, and even still 76% said that Arab states are 1 nation. 70-fucking-6 percent. That's a higher approval rating than the EU has ever had in its history. You know how many Egyptians responded that Arab states are separate nations with weak ties between each other? A whopping 12%. 

So as usual, I am aligned with the common Egyptian identity and common Egyptian political ideology, and you are living in a diaspora reddit English bubble.

As for king crane. Fucking obviously it's to do with the Levant. It pertains to the Levant and Arabia and illustrates my point that the Levantine people did not want to be split up from Syria or Arabia in 1919.

&gt; Let me be clear: Egyptians are *one*. How fascist of me to think of Egyptians as united.

Gooooood are you sure you aren't a 12 year old girl?? 

No country on earth is *one*. Because we don't live in the fucking Mickey Mouse Club. Egyptians are not one. They weren't even one in the Pharaonic period you fucking illiterate ignorant horse's ass. Syria isn't one. Italy isn't one. Germany isn't one. Spain isn't one. Finland isn't one. This is 100% emotional masturbation bullshit that means nothing. It's like your favourite past time is blowing hot air. Hahaha so juvenile it's unbelievable.

Anyway I'm finished with this idiotic argument. You have nothing of value to add. You're a fascist who wants to control how others identify, and you bitch about pan-Arabists while casually denying the identity of the majority of Egyptians, without any sense of irony or awareness. And supporting a union of Arab states does not make me a nationalist. It makes me a federalist and an anti-colonialist. I also support the EU and closer ties within the EU, and no one has called me a European nationalist yet, probably because they're not ignorant children and understand that close cultural and historical ties lead to political unions that benefit everyone.",,/r/europe/comments/edn2t5/3500yo_egyptian_sphinx_on_the_bank_of_the_neva/fctnflg/,kerat,1577950127

Everyone on reddit keeps beating the same dead horse, the supposed signing of a pact as a proof of an alliance and friendship of USSR and Germany. In truth, both sides wanted to slit each other's throats, but both had different ideas about timing. Stalin in particular was not keen to start an expansionist war into Europe as he toppled Trotsky and his ""world revolution"" doctrine in favour of ""communism in a single country"" view. 

&gt;Also non of the pact mentioned above included secret protocol that divided half of Europe, unlike MR pact.

Stalin knew Hitler was going to invade Poland. In 1938 he sent diplomats to Paris to get the English and French on board with an anti-Hitler alliance. He was rebuffed. Read the link I posted, I can also link to some academic papers later on this subject, if you have JSTOR access. 

After being rebuffed by Western Allies, Stalin was faced with two choices: have a very much hostile Germany take all the territory up to the Soviet border. Or, he could make a temporary treaty with Germany to stall for time and seize some buffer land to further insulate USSR from Nazi Germany.

Yohanan Cohen describes Lipski's discussion with Hitler, which took place on 21 October 1938, as ""characteristic of the kinds of things that had come to dominate the Polish establishment and public were comments by Jósef Lipski.""[4] Responding to Hitler's suggestions, Lipski said that ""if he can find such a solution we will erect him a beautiful monument in Warsaw"".[4][5][6][7] Timothy Snyder stated that ""historians of these negotiations often quote Lipski's remark that Poland would build a monument to Hitler if he found a way to resolve the Jewish question. With knowledge of the Holocaust we can find this remark even more revolting that it, in fact, was. Lipski was expressing the hope that despite the overwhelming difficulties, Germany could induce some maritime power to open some overseas colony to Polish Jews.

1713,"&gt;The President of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, has called for the rapid start of accession talks with Western Balkan countries, despite the blockade, particularly by France. The prospect of accession for northern Macedonia and Albania is very close to his heart, the Italian told the newspapers of the German Funke Media Group (Tuesday). ""I very much regret that the Council was unable to give an ok for the talks in October due to the vetoes of some states and I hope that we will soon be able to correct this decision"".

&gt;At the EU summit on 17th and 18th October French President Emmanuel Macron and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in particular had prevented the opening of accession talks with the two countries, which had been advocated by other EU countries, including Germany. The government in Paris is demanding a fundamental reform of the accession process as a condition for agreeing to the start of negotiations.

&gt;Northern Macedonia, in particular, has invested a great deal of political effort in advance of the start of accession negotiations. Against massive resistance from the nationalist opposition, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev had pushed through the change of the name of Macedonia to Northern Macedonia. EU member Greece had demanded the ultimate, because a province in the north of the country is also called Macedonia. The refusal from Brussels triggered a domestic political crisis in Northern Macedonia. A new election was therefore scheduled for 12 April.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not a fact because this is not happening. Nobody is reporting anything any differently because they feel less safe about anything. This is what happened in Europe after the Danish cartoon controversy when people were actually scared of publishing things. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No. Government should be transparent. It wasn't ""Trump"", a person, it  was ""the President of the US"", the head of state and head of government.  They have a responsibility to keep the public informed, which is what  media is for. Compare this to the way press conferences work in the  Bundespressekonferenz in Germany: the press conference is held by the  press, and politicians are invited in.

&amp;#x200B;

Who cares? It was still his press conference because he is the President. This happens all the time, and the Court ultimately said that he couldn't exclude the press firms he wanted to exclude anyway. Nobody cares how it happens in Germany.

Laws and taxes were put in to place to mitigate the damage it causes in health issues and as far as i am aware those tax monies from alcohol are used to fund government funded healthcare and so on... but if you feel they have been wrong step up and go change things.

1891,"Lol, nobody in the West knows about [Polish-Nazi Germany Non-Aggression Pact of 1934](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%E2%80%93Polish_Non-Aggression_Pact) either, what's your point? Nor do you know of [Stalinist efforts to make an alliance with the West](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/3223834/Stalin-planned-to-send-a-million-troops-to-stop-Hitler-if-Britain-and-France-agreed-pact.html) before finally signing a Pact with Hitler. Stalin was mortally afraid of Hitler because Hitler made it plain as day that he was going to invade the East for its land, he even said so in Mein Kampf, a book that was hardly a state secret. 

And Molotov-Ribbentrop is not at all unknown in Russia. Putinists just rebrand it as a pact of convenience. Which it was. That's literally why you sign a non-aggression pact, to hopefully buy yourself time from an enemy. You don't sign non-aggression pacts if you're friendly. This is why Poland signed one with Nazis, they were also wary of them. 

I refuse to shed a tear for anything prewar Poland did, they were cunts just like Russia. Poland invaded Ukraine and Lithuania, the two main ""brother"" nations of the erstwhile Rzeczpospolita. Poland participated in the slicing up of Czechoslovakia when they nabbed Zaolzie, which pleased Hitler to no end, he used that as proof that carving up Czechoslovakia was not just a German crime. 

The difference between me and a Putinist vatnik is that I recognise and very much feel bad for Katyn and the postwar oppression of Poles. But prewar? Poland was the sworn enemy of Russia and there is no reason to believe that bullshit victimhood narrative Poles spin. Poles tried to [take out USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheism) just as USSR tried to take out Poland. Poles fought an expansionist war in Ukraine where they came in conflict with expansionist Russia. 

But am I supposed to feel sorry that they were weaker and lost despite expanding in every direction? If they were stronger, we'd have repeat of Lzhedmitry and the Time of Troubles, a period of history every Russian is intimately familiar with, when Poles marched on Moscow and installed their puppet monarch in Kremlin. This has always been the goal of Poland until after WWII, when it became clear they lost their chance finally. 

WWII was not Poland's fault, but nor was it Russia's. WWII could have been easily prevented if the Western Allies actually made a Pact with USSR in 1938 against Germany. Or if Western allies invaded West of Germany when Germany was busy in Poland. Instead the West chose to cower. For which the French paid, except not really because they just surrendered rather than letting their country burn and bleed like it did in WWI. So instead they let Russians burn and bleed against the Nazis. 

But yes, let's blame USSR for WWII even though half of Europe wouldn't be alive if Soviet troops didn't put an end to Nazi extermination efforts.",Apparently Serbia according to /u/cLnYze19N,/r/europe/comments/eihr2t/partition_of_eastern_europe_under_the/fcsu78c/,Aemilius_Paulus,1577925215

1963,"&gt;The fact is that the entirety of the law would be drawn up by the EU in a federalist state.

By merit of the fact that the EU would be a state; the EU legislature would draw up legislation for the EU. This is not to say that a federal arrangement would not delegate significant competencies to the states and their regional governments. 

&gt;the EU has often been weak on both defence and offence when it comes to military conflict

Of course. It doesn't have the capacity to act because people not unlike yourself oppose any and all centralisation of critical powers to the Union. When you have to get 28 states (two of which have a population smaller than my town) to agree on things like foreign policy and taxation(areas where, as far as I know, the veto still stands), of course little will get done. In fact, I would argue that such a system is undemocratic as member states representing 512 million people may vote in favour of something but then Malta with its 500K people can come along and say no; therefore overriding the will of governments representing 512 million people. Which brings me to this:

&gt;I don't think you could get the EU council to agree on any kind of military intervention when it is really required.

Yes. The veto is unacceptable and undemocratic.

&gt;Talk of disbanding NATO or that NATO is weak

NATO is weak, by merit of the fact that Europe is weak. Why is Europe weak? because it's 28 disparate militaries using different equipment, training, etc. It doesn't help that defence budgets are so low. The Union has never promoted disbanding NATO and speaks only of strengthening the European pillar through military integration.

&gt;The fact is that sovereignty would not exist in a federal EU state

Your nation states sovereignty? No. Your sovereignty? Yes. Geopolitical players like China, India, etc can pressure your little state in to doing what they want right now. Look at how your government sucks off Xi and buys up your ports. This is because Greece on its own is weak. A European federal state is a way to protect the ability of Europeans to govern themselves and make their own decisions in the world. A world with a disunified Europe is a world in which the many individual European states are subjugated to foreign interests.

&gt;because in a federal state everyone must follow the rules and be as one.

By definition a federal state is the opposite of this.


&gt;What benefit does being a federation give us?

Already addressed above. It's necessary to ensure that Europeans (note: Europeans, not the states) continue to maintain their sovereignty and wealth in a world in which powers that don't have Europe's interests in mind are rising.

&gt;When it's the same people, in the same country (as with say Germany) then it's not a problem

You say this but you forget that merely 200 years ago Germany didn't even exist. Germany is a perfect example of a federation and the creation of a common identity. It's like when Brits complain about the EU taking away the UK's sovereignty as if the UK isn't a product of destroying the sovereignty of the English and Scottish states.

Also, the name was/is elk, originally (compare to Swedish *älg*, for example).

So the end result is that instead of borrowing the Algonquian name *wapiti* for *Cervus canadensis*, they were mislabelled as elk, and instead of calling *Alces alces* elk like it is in all continental European languages, North America borrowed ""moose"" from Algonquian for those.

And being ""dangerously-close"" to something doesn't need to imply that that someone may lose life or limb.    ""Dangerously-close"" just means that something is at risk of crossing the line.

You can find plenty of *Daily Mail* headlines referring to someone being ""dangerously close"" to a ""wardrobe malfunction"", for example.

2307,"Even this pretty one-sided article worded one thing right about Soviet proposals:

&gt; The USSR proposed the conclusion of a formal five- to ten-yearagreement for immediate mutual assistance of every kind including military ’in case of aggression in Europe against any of the contracting parties’. Following points spelled out reciprocalobligations including the rendering of assistance to all the East European states from the Balticto Black Seas, along Soviet frontiers. Military staff talks should take place ’in the shortest periodof time’ to establish the details of military assistance to all the countries named in the proposal.The contracting parties would agree to no separate peace. The Soviet proposal dotted the ’i’s, ormost of them. 

Soviets wanted to include all Central European neighbor of SU, even the one that were not under direct danger of invasion, like Baltic Countries. And enter them without even permission of their governments in case of German attack at any one of them. 

So for example if Germany would attack Poland, then Soviet forces would enter Polish eastern territories, Baltic States and Romania, and possibly stalling against the Germans.

The same scenario that actual have happened in 1939 and after, but this time Soviet actions will be somewhat legal (they wouldn't have to wait two weeks to make an impression that ""Polish state was destroyed"", or stage elections in Baltic States).

Also claim of the author that German-Soviet talks started in August 1939 is laughable. He didn't give even explanation why Litvinov was deposed, which is obvious.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/ei5dba/imports_from_the_ussr_as_a_percentage_of_total/fcqincp/,iwanttosaysmth,1577886670

Untrue, nuclear power plants were completely replaced with renewables, not with natural gas. In fact in 2010, the year before Fukushima, 63 TWh of electricity were produced through natural gas, in 2019 it was 54 TWh. Gas use is actually down, not up.

Obviously there was a small uptick immediately after taking down several nuclear power plants in 2011, because you can't install all the renewable energy capacity over night, but it has since been reduced massively again. **Coal went down from 230 TWh in 2010 to 151 TWh in 2019.**",Europe,/r/europe/comments/eigsmb/renewable_electricity_production_in_germany/fcqix8w/,linknewtab,1577886815

2411,"I think the whole concept of it being a meassure of freedom is missleading since it's mostly loking at how democratic a country is and public participation in politics. For us in the west it might seem logical and fair to have that as our golden standard but many of these questions are heavily influenced by not only the wealth of a nation and its people but also the culture.

If we take Egypt for example we saw that having fair democratic elections did not cause the country to become more free since the people opted to vote for a very populist oarty that didn't want to protect everyones basic human rights. I would argue that in their case having a tolerant dictatorship for example would cause a higher level of freedom whereas the scoring would argue otherwise.

Basically, my main point is that the focus is too much on the political proces eventhough politics should be a tool in order to attain freedom. It's not the end goal itself. Also, having just 3 categories to grouonall countries in is a bit too narrow in my opinion, i would rather see a ranking of all countries. Also the questions used should focus more on the freedom people have relative to their socio-economic group in my opinion, like a relative freedom score from an individuals perspective.

Ideally we would have questionaires filled in by local inhabitants of each country and area but that would need to be completely anonymous since people could be pressured into lying and even then we wouldn't be sure about those results but it's better than nothing.",,/r/europe/comments/eigpmf/freedom_in_the_world_2019_freedom_house/fcq61f5/,younikorn,1577879516

&gt;So when one party of the court case funds the judges, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it in your opinion? It wouldn't compromise impartiality of such a court at all?

With the difference being that a judge makes life-changing decisions. You just cannot disqualify research because it's conducted by one party.

if we did that we would have to disqualify all pharmaceuticals research effectiveness , medical imaging technology etc since they're funded by big pharma industry, same goes for all other industries.

But we don't do that since they adhere to a methodology. Point out the flaws in the methodology, do it.

Ironically the whole point of the EU WAS to protect Europe from globalism, or whatever globalism is supposed to mean since that term changes definition constantly. From the perspective of European nationalists, they were under a pull from America and the USSR, the Americans wanted to financially dominate all the countries and the USSR wanted to conquer it. With Europe so fractured and divided, each state was at the mercy of one of them. However, if they banded together and formed a federation, they could become a power in their own right and keep them from being dominated by outside powers. 

In this perspective, the UK is leaving itself at the mercy of globalism, allowing its sovereignty to be further eroded by outside powers making lopsided trade deals. The UK left the EU and found that it had no bargaining power and is complaining that others are being unfair to it. The EU is basically a mixed bag.

One of the richest, most powerful businessmen in the country is behind bars, the PM’s ex Chief of Staff is being accused of being complicit in the murder and the PM admitted to accepting gifts (wines worth €6,000 and a €20,000 watch) from this businessman (essentially bribes, with an obvious quid pro quo).

Practically non existent except $20 million worth of gasoline and lubricants from Standard Oil and 13,000 tons of crude oil every month from Venezuelan subsidiary of Standard Oil.

Yes, USA formally took out Germany from the trade concessions list but it did not forbid trade with Germany and US companies who owned factories in Germany like Standard Oil (IG Farben) and Ford (Opel) supplied Germany with strategic resources as part of their inter-company transfers.

...so much for non existent.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Signaling out USSR isn't a hypocrisy, because USSR renewed trade relations with Germany after they started the war. 

USSR wasn't at war and was trading with Germany just like USA, Sweden, Romania, Turkey, Spain, Portugal. Moreover, Poland would have continued to trade with Germany too, had Germany attacked someone else and not Poland. So yes, it's hypocrisy.

2781,"Pay attention to the dates and the units themselves: they are percentages. Not absolute values. That is, they do not reflect a specific contribution to the economy, only a proportion.

Why? Well, let's open the same source as OP: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi%E2%80%93Soviet_economic_relations_(1934%E2%80%9341)

And let's look at this table:

**German Imports in millions of Reichsmarks**

Year|USSR|Poland|Finland|Estonia|Latvia|Lithuania                 
:--|:-- |:-- |:-- |:-- |:-- |:--                                                                                                                                    
1934|223.0|78.1|42.3|8.2|21.1|15.1   
1938|47.4|109.4|88.6|24.0|43.5|27.6
1938|52.8|140.8|88.9|24.3|43.6|27.8

And what do we see? That the USSR in absolute terms was one of the most important importers of Germany before the Nazi coup. And after that their trade relations were cut so drastically that even **Lavia** was a more profitable import partner than the USSR.

But you will not see this in the percentage chart, where one USSR is displayed. Do you know why it starts specifically from April and May?

They did the opposite of most of Europe: massive capital injections and nationalisation of key failing assets (TARP, Auto Bailout, etc) their government even made a profit from these when they sold the stock they bought! It was very shrewd behaviour and America was out of recession by 2009, GDP reached pre-recession in 2010 and unemployment recovered in 2014.

Austerity in Europe on the other hand failed miserably, most of you took nearly a decade to get back where you were (UK: left recession 2010, GDP 2015 and unemployment 2017. France: left recession in 2010 only to have another in 2013, GDP recovered in 2016 (!!!) and unemployment still hasn't recovered.

With the energy-rich waters of the eastern Mediterranean becoming ever more strategically important, Cyprus, like Greece, has worked hard in recent years to boost relations with Israel. The alliance is seen as increasingly significant at a time of growing Turkish belligerence in the region.

Campaigners have pointed out that on 28 July, the night the Briton reportedly revoked her rape claim, the Greek foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, was in Israel meeting the country’s political leadership. “I must say that the briefing here on everything that is happening in Cyprus is very important to us,” Dendias told reporters at a press conference in Jerusalem.",,/r/europe/comments/ei7ygq/cyprus_defends_its_courts_amid_rising_anger_over/fco1d6k/,am3l1a,1577822312

3284,"Czechs are proud of their currency and their central bank is a very respected institution. It's not only about common people, but the shitstorm of Eurocrisis in 2011 convinced many elites (academicians, politicians also people from business) that Euro is a no-go in forseeable future.

They are also not afraid to actively use monetary policy. In 2013-2017 crown was not allowed to go beyond 27 CZK/ EUR. This was mainly to prevent deflation. Some politicians criticized this decision, but it was a successful operation. Something similar that Swiss bank did with franc.

In short, Czechs trust Czech central bank more than ECB.

In Slovakia, Slovak crown was also managed good, but there was less national pride in it. In usual discussions about comparing Slovak and Czech economy and how Slovakia is catching up with Czechia it always included currency comparison. For Slovaks this was always a bittersweet remainder. Czech and Slovak crowns in 1993 started 1:1, but soon Sk was devalued to 1,1 SKK to CZK. Since around 1998 it was devalued to 1,3 and this difference was never equaled since then. However wages were numerically similar (or sometimes even higher in Czechia), which meant Czechs were richer. Prices were often numerically lower in Czechia which meant they could buy more.

3326,"Currency control enables mercantilism. You reduce the value of your currency to increase exports and depress imports. In this model each country is an economic island with a large domestic economy and a relatively small international trade component. Combined imports and exports equal 12.2% of USA GDP for example, enabling it to depress imports and boost exports by weakening its currency without fatally damaging the economy.

However, take the case of many Eurozone countries where combined value of imports &amp; exports is almost as large as GDP or even greater. In 2018 the value of trade as a portion of GDP for Belgium was 82.6%, for Ireland 122.3%, Germany 47.4%, and Netherlands 84.3%. With that level of international integration what's needed is not the ability to carry out beggar thy neighbour currency devaluations; rather, these economies need a stable store of value to facilitate trade and bring predictability to systemically important imports and exports. Where's the sense in devaluing your currency when imports comprise a third of your GDP in value?

Circle K, the gas station, is one of the best places to quickly get decent coffee and has the price range about similar.

Ristiisa pubi is a pub, so not to expect much from it. It's not oriented to go and drink coffee.

3419,"Alright. She is a chancellor, not a dictator and not even a president. She doesn't have the power to decide this on her own but even if she did, we live in a democracy where the majority of the population is opposed to it. 

Additionally even in the 70s, one of the reasons the anti-nuclear movement was more successful here than in France is that Germany isn't as centralised as France. Berlin can't just decree 20 new reactors to be built.

But even if they could, it's not the 70s anymore. Just look at France *today*. They're doubting the future of Nucelar too, because of the clusterfuck that EDFs current projects turned into and because renewables will likely turn out to be cheaper anyway.

Let's ignore the financial fuckery: Flamanville was started in 04 and originally sheduled to be finished in 2012, currently scheduled for 2022 and 13B. Olkiluoto was opened to bidding in 03 and supposed to be finished in 2012, currently scheduled for 2022. Hinkley Point C was started in 2013 and is scheduled for 2025. At this point it would be a nice surprise if even one of them makes that date.

So, even if she were to spent an enourmous amount of political capital to restart Nuclear power in Germany, a timeline of 10 years to replace coal is absurd. We'd probably need a decade to even start building, nevermind finishing. Even after pushing it through the political opposition, finding places to built them, securing the financing - there are only a handful of companies in the world that can manage these kind of projects. And frankly, even they suck at it.

Or, instead of forcing a bunch of expensive and problematic projects against the will of the people, she could increase support for renewables. Which are in comparison trivial to built, can be scaled up quickly, are cheaper, have no issue attracting private investment and have broad support of the population.

Nevermind how you personally feel about nuclear enegery, it's a no starter in Germany so critizising Merkel for not pushing it is frankly uninformed. In any case though, the timeline of 10 years to replace all coal puts it into the realm of fantasy.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/ei2qs4/all_manmade_merkel_vows_to_keep_fighting_against/fcnasl7/,Svorky,1577807598

Little Venice is a 10-15 minute walk tops. If you think that's some can't miss activity, you must be a boring person.

&gt;the famous windmills

Those windmills can be found on every island in the Cyclades, they're nothing special. It's a freaking windmill lol. How long are you going to stare at it? For hours?

&gt;Dine in the restaurants where the most famous chefs in the world come to cook for the famous guests?

Sure, if you have the money. Most people unfortunately don't which is why one of the biggest downsides of visiting Mykonos is that it puts a big dent in your pocket unlike other islands in Greece that are much more affordable.

&gt;Enjoy the most beautiful sunsets in Greece second only to the famous [Oia, Santorini](https://atasteoftravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Santorini-Sunset-10-1.jpg)?

The sunset in Mykonos is average IMO especially compared to other places in Greece and certainly doesn't even come close to the one in Oia. If you want to experience a beautiful sunset, I suggest visiting [Meteora](https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/07/71/73/6d.jpg).

&gt;I could really go on forever but it just sounds you are ignorant and could have googled what to do in Mykonos other than clubbing yourself if you actually cared?

Definitely not ignorant about Greece considering I spent most of my childhood there.

&gt;One reason for this is that American companies offer fewer vacation days.

After one year of employment, these workers were granted 10 days of paid vacation, on average.

I put ""invasion comments"" into quotes. Again, the 1968 events are described as ""invasion"" in Russia.

""Conflict"" would be a better analogy here, since it's a more general term for ""war"".

&gt; A law commemorating the victims of that totalitarian past, to ensure it never returns, therefore its definitive end is entirely in the spirit of the treaty, especially since it does not single out the USSR or its successor Russia, which it very well could have, since the invasion was ordered by it.

**How would you feel it half a million Estonians died in the process of deposing Estonia from a dictator?** was the question.

&gt; No, it's more like ""if you support dictators too much, you discredit yourself"".

How? And how did I ""support them too much"", since it was what you implied.

&gt; What do you think dictators do?

Depends on the dictator. But in many cases a dictator is better for stability and peace than a decades long civil war.

&gt; Oh ffs, you are just a full on xenophobe...

How? Lol. You seem to like making just baseless statements.

&gt; Estonia has been forced to take in the second-most (after Latvia) share of foreigners in the last half a century, which almost made us a minority in our own country. Of course we see a problem with an additional number of foreigners, who are difficult to integrate.

Maybe, but that is still nationalistic. I didn't say Estonia and others aren't justified in their opinion. I was saying that the instability in Iraq, which was caused by the US, has caused the refugee crisis. And this caused many countries, including Estonia, to become more EU-skeptic, which damages our ""little"" European project to quite a big extend. And you seem to argue, or at least act, that this instability is not a biggey and is ""just what happens"" or ""had to happen"".

&gt; What a xenophobic stereotype you are...

What? That was literally one of the main reasons of Brexit. How is that xenophobic?

&gt; Iraq and Libya are similar? One was an illegal invasion, while the other was a UN-sanctioned intervention...

And led to about the same thing. A civil war. And if Russia didn't step in in Syria, we would have the same with Syria and probably a new refugee crisis somewhere down the line.

&gt; Why are you entering these conversations if you clearly don't know the backgrounds of these conflicts?

Who says this? You can always find how conflicts are vastly different, because all conflicts are in many ways unique. One can still compare them. And looking at the big picture, Libya and Iraq are rather similar. And Syria could have been the next one.

&gt; Russia would be the hostile dictatorship invading our country for imperialistic reasons - all the deaths would be on them...

3629,"States control their economies with fiscal and monetary instruments. Adopting Euro means giving up one of the two. If things are going pretty well it may not be the big issue and benefits may very well outweight the costs, but if there are economic problems and the monetary policy of ECB happens to be exact opposite of what your country needs (like with Greece) while you are a peripheral country with little real control over it (like Greece) the results may be catastrophic (like with Greece). 

All in all many economists argue that adopting common currency without deeper (mostly fiscal, so common budget and common taxes) integration is putting horse before the cart. And that the Euro is actively detrimental to EU economy in its current state.

Also the fact that leaving the Euro is an economic suicide in all but name (it would make Brexit look line non-event) isn't helping. 

So while I'm for further EU integration (if it moves away from its current neoliberal position) I'd rather wait for those plans to materialize before considering the adoption of Euro. 

As a sidenote Euro main use as I see it atm would be as a kind of blood pact preventing theoretical nationalist governments from attempting to pull us out of the EU. Which may not be as stupid as it sounds considering that the interconnected nature of German and Polish economies means that we're very unlikely to end up on the wrong side of the ECB policies. This, however, assumes that Germans aren't batshit crazy when it comes issues of deficit spending and fiscal/monetary policy as a whole.

In turn, due to weaker economies like for example Greece, the Euro has a lower value than the Mark would have which makes it easier to export German goods. So the already strong (and very export-focused) economy of Germany gets a boost, and the already weak economy of Greece is further weakened by both having the same currency.

This sort of approach adopted by our partners runs counter to our bilateral agreements enshrined in the Russian-Czech Treaty of Friendly Relations and Cooperation (of August 26, 1993), where the two parties announced their “desire to finally draw the bottom line under the totalitarian past related to the inadmissible use of force against Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the further unjustified presence of Soviet troops on Czechoslovakian territory.”

&gt;Prague’s aspiration to return back to the events that happened fifty years ago in order to include them in a modern political context, its reluctance to turn over this page of history, which is beclouding the atmosphere of Russian-Czech relations, is unlikely to facilitate advances in bilateral cooperation.

3657,"Here seems a lot of misconceptions going around.

To start of ... 'you' (as in a state) have no influence on the monetary policies at all. In the US, in the UK, the Euro-Zone ... central banks are doing the monetary policies. A state have no influence on it, because it is for a good reason independent.

Now, whats the benefits of an own currency. It is easier to answer it the other way around. The Euro-Zone have the big problem, that it has many regions/countries with different economical strengths. But they have one currency and so one monetary policy. At the moment the EU has a 0% central bank interest. For some countries like Greece or Italy this is important and right, because they have big problems in their economy and high interest rates would result in a high unemployment rate. But on the other side, you have Germany for example with nearly full emplyment and the need of interests to cool down inflation.

But this isnt possible anymore. If there wouldnt be a Euro, the central banks of Greece and Italy could basically have 0% interest and printing money to keep the problems of the states in bay. But Germany which hasnt the same problem, could have a high interest rate and tackle down their own problems.

But with one currency this is gone. It brings plenty of benefits of course too, but it brings this problem, that the central bank isnt able to tackle the issue of the single states properly.",,/r/europe/comments/ei1cs2/support_for_the_eus_single_currency_the_euro/fcmuwlj/,Rochhardo,1577793426

If two currency areas have different inflation rates then the exchange rate will tend to adjust to keep the exchange rate of actual goods/services roughly constant. To take an unrealistic example, double all your prices overnight and your currency value will typically halve (foreigners are not going to suddenly agree to pay twice as much of their own currency for your products).

Put those two countries in a single currency area whilst not solving the divergence in inflationary pressures and you're left with only harder solutions to that problem - solutions such as forcing down prices and wages. Until you manage to do that you're left with flows of money out of your country that you either have to fund somehow (such as borrowing from abroad to finance a private-sector property boom, like in Spain, or doing so to finance government borrowing, like in Greece, or via TARGET 2 balances which might give creditor countries a problem one day) or which end up cutting your total demand.

We don't sometimes :) We treat the summer like winter is treated elsewhere. Something to put up with when bad and enjoy on the milder days. 

We go outside early and late and use a/c in the middle of the day. We don't walk around in it in the middle of the day like tourists do as we realise it is the equivalent of a harsh winter elsewhere. We plan life around the weather. Home, office and car all have good a/c.

Our Brisbane winter, on the other hand, is mostly like a perfect mild summer elsewhere. Dry,19- 24c, clear blue skies. It really can be glorious. You are almost always guaranteed a great day.

What in the hell are you talking about? WW2 ended in 1945, that's just a fact. The Cold War followed and that's what CEE experienced, but that was an entirely seperate affair and not a continuation of WW2. It also wasn't even an actual war.
&gt;And Germany was occupied by decades, deprived of the real choice, given opportunities to thrive in Pax Americana or descend into chaos and poverty. 

Incorrect. Germany was only occupied for a few years. The Federal Republic was founded in 1949 and it got its most of its sovereignty back with the General treaty in 1954. That's where the occupation period ended.

Here's some research:
 https://www.thecumbrialep.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Cumbria-Rural-and-Visitor-Economy-Growth-Plan2-FINAL-edited-for-PDF.pdf

Lake District international visitors: 200,000. London international visitors: 20 million. That same document states that domestic tourism has flatlined. It also says, under visitor future growth drivers:

""- UK economic and population growth concentrated in London and the South East where Cumbria’s market penetration is low
- UK population change is leading to an increasingly ageing population. This may behelpful in the short to medium term as Cumbria’s market penetration isconsiderably higher in the 45 plus age group. 
- However, it raises a longer term concern as the current younger generations age and if there has been a loss of the “habit” of coming to the Lakes/Cumbria amongst younger people now that is reflected in a falling future propensity to visit""

So who am I to believe?
- Angry redditors who haven't been to the lakes

Or

- What I've seen with my very own eyes after being there 5 times (it is very much a white 35+ middle class fest)
- The person in charge of marketing
- The tourist board's own research

That seems to imply that we have no speed limits at all. We do have them and plenty of them...........where-ever they were needed based on security or noise pollution needs. No reason to limit speed on a Autobahn just going straight for the next 100km. As for road deaths.......only about 13% of all German road fatalities are on the Autobahn.....and a significant chunk of those again down to accidents involving Lorries. Which certainly arent going over 120km/h.  Most deaths happen on country roads........all of which are speed limited.

4090,"&gt; What is the movement of the magnetic pole in relation to the movement of the true pole? Do they move completely independent of each other?

No, but the magnetic poles do occasionally reverse, which is as extreme a movement as is possible.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal

&gt;A geomagnetic reversal is a change in a planet's magnetic field such that the positions of magnetic north and magnetic south are interchanged (not to be confused with geographic north and geographic south). The Earth's field has alternated between periods of normal polarity, in which the predominant direction of the field was the same as the present direction, and reverse polarity, in which it was the opposite. These periods are called chrons.
&gt;
&gt;Reversal occurrences are statistically random. There have been 183 reversals over the last 83 million years. The latest, the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, occurred 780,000 years ago,[1] with widely varying estimates of how quickly it happened. Other sources estimate that the time that it takes for a reversal to complete is on average around 7000 years for the four most recent reversals.[2] Clement (2004)[2] suggests that this duration is dependent on latitude, with shorter durations at low latitudes, and longer durations at mid and high latitudes. Although variable, the duration of a full reversal is typically between 2000 and 12000 years, which is one to two orders of magnitude less than the duration of magnetic chrons.[3]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ehlb0a/earths_north_magnetic_pole_is_heading_for_russia/fcmb4z4/,duisThias,1577769276

\- Maybe I would call Vladimir Putin, but I know why the whole dispute was raised. To share us with Europe and Russia, but also to divide us internally. First, I would meet with all those responsible for foreign policy plus the opposition and work out a common Polish position for these lies - said in the ""Guest of Events"" program presidential candidate Szymon Hołownia.

&amp;#x200B;

Bogdan Rymanowski asked Hołownia how he would react to the statement of the Russian president, who stated, among others, that Poland cooperated with Hitler.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Before calling Putin, I would meet with everyone who is responsible for foreign policy plus the opposition in Poland and have developed a common Polish position on those lies and manipulations that were found in Putin's statements - explained Hołownia.

&amp;#x200B;

The presidential candidate stressed that ""he is fed up with this argument."" - I am absolutely convinced that this is also playing a dispute within Poland. There are issues that should be above divisions. We should speak with one voice about our history - said Hołownia.

&amp;#x200B;

""We are not a significant player for Russia""

He added, ""We should think about our role in Europe."" - Such things can only be afforded to someone who is weak in Europe and it is known that Brussels will not react - said Hołownia.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I would subscribe to the words from the prime minister's statement. This is a sharp and firm position, but the situation is unprecedented. The president of the country, who is an important neighbor, no matter how our relations are arranged, plays tactically with a historical card, shaking and differentiating - said the presidential candidate.

VIDEO: see the entire conversation with Szymon Hołownia

&amp;#x200B;

He emphasized that he is ""a supporter of the best relations with Russia"". - But I know exactly that for Russia we are such a partner that we are part of a larger whole, even the EU - he added. - For them we are not a significant player in their calculation - he explained.

""It's easier to hit someone like that""

Hołownia asked, ""what does our position in the EU look like, our agency when it comes to the EU's eastern policy?"". ""If there is a message in the world that we are more and more on the EU border, not more in its center, it is easier to hit someone like that,"" he said.

&amp;#x200B;

He emphasized that ""one of the basic lessons we should learn from this crisis is that we should seriously consider our place in Europe and how strongly we are connected with those with whom we could answer such things together.""

On the other hand, in the ""Events and Opinions"" program, guests of Piotr Witwicki will be: Witold Waszczykowski, MEP, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and Paweł Kowal, MP, former deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",,/r/europe/comments/ehw91c/i_would_call_putin_but_first_i_would_work_out_a/fclx80k/,bm52oc,1577758678

4293,"I'm not saying they are exclusively Roma, because living in a rural area also increases the risk of teen pregnancies. I suspect that's where most of the rest come from, along with families which are very economically deprived.

However, I do have a lot of Roma neighbors and I know whom the children belong to, so there's not much room for confusion there. Sure, you'll see a woman with a bunch of children, but I know they're not all hers. In some cases, you don't see the mother at all because she's abroad doing mysterious things while the children are being raised by grandparents and even grand-grandparents. In others, I know that both parents were very young, but that they're responsible and have family support. But I also know when the mother is 16-17, already has a couple of children, and has no real source of income of her own (and will likely never have one because you can't get a job if you've only finished middle-school and are functionally illiterate). She gets by because the guy is in Italy, also doing mysterious things, and for now sending her money. 

In the villages, I'm sure there aren't significant differences between ethnic groups. A majority village likely has similar numbers of young mothers as minority ones. 

I also teach university, as does my mother, as do my friends, and we hardly ever see pregnant students or students who need special accommodation because they have small children. The ones who do tend to be women in their late 20s or even 30s. Of course they are a self-selecting group, but it's obvious that the reason why they're able to study and work is because they don't have children (or if they do, they're married and have supportive families). On the other hand, in Moldova, this is quite common, and the vast majority of the girls with small children are not Roma.

I'd like to point out that perhaps there is also prejudice in how willing we are to accept the validity of someone else's experiences. Please understand that you don't live in our environments, you don't deal professionally with the same people we do, and that we are not all unapologetic bigots. You can't pretend that everyone has the same chance to become an adolescent mother because that means groups which are actually at risk don't receive the support they need. My issue isn't that there are a lot of rural kids, or poor kids, or brown kids running around, but that there are all these young women whose potential is often entirely wasted.

&gt;Socialism can be defined as a system of collective ownership and management of the means of production and the distribution of goods. Socialism also views that in a capitalist state, the wealth and power is concentrated among a small section of the society. Socialism can also be stated to be a society where all people work as equals in cooperation for the common good of all.

&gt;Democratic socialism gives more importance to a democratic character. While having almost the same principles as that of socialism, democratic socialism believes in a socialism through the ballot box. It states that any change in government and society should be through fair elections.

4490,"It should be noted that Serbian propaganda machine has been in overdrive for the past few weeks. As such, any information concerning this topic should be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism.

Anyway, the claim that SOC ""property"" is being ""stolen"" by our government is nothing more than a blatant lie. The law clearly states that ownership of any religious building, built prior to 01.12.1918, for which it's respective religious communities can't provide **any proof of ownership** (in accordance to the laws that applied either at that point in time, or currently), shall become property of the state.

The reason SOC finds this problematic (to say the least) is because they can't provide anything more than hearsay. This is because SOC as we know it, wasn't present in Montenegro until 1920. Knowing that, it is easy to understand, yet impossible to support their reaction which comprises of claims that Montenegrin courts are biased against it, the claims that the law itself is ""unholy"", and desperate attempts to incite revolt.

The information that is consciously being omitted not only here, and on other similar topics, but on practically all Serbian media-outlets as well, is that the law in question clearly states that the court of last instance is not Montenegrin, but the European Court of Human Rights. Should SOC be dissatisfied with results of any court proceedings that may occur in the future, they can always take appeal it in Strasbourg.

On top of that, curiously enough, they also fail to mention that as per the law in question, all religious buildings it applies to, are to be treated as separate entities, and be assigned separate court cases, should any religious community object to the transfer, or rather a return of ownership to the state. As such, we're years away from any resolution. They will have their 

And if that wasn't enough, they also fail to mention that even if they can't prove ownership, they will still be guaranteed a right to use the religious buildings in question. That said, in order to do so, they will have to register in Montenegro as a religious organization, and pay tax on any profits they may have. In return, all religious workers will be guaranteed a state pension, funded from the aforementioned proceedings.

To sum it all up - nothing is being taken from them, let alone stolen, and the SOC priests aren't being purged from Montenegro, as the Serbian propaganda machine is claiming. The law in question is a modern, just law, that has been in the works for 5 years, and has undergone numerous changes. All religious communities were given a chance to take part in it's creation, and all accepted - all but the SOC. On top of that, before the law was even taken to the parliament to be voted upon, all religious communities agreed with it - all but the SOC. Even if you're not well versed on this topic, you ought to see a pattern emerge...

What we have here is an organization that refuses to even register in Montenegro, refuses to pay any taxes, refuses to accept Montenegro as an independent state, and spews hatred on a daily basis - as of this moment it's mostly towards Montenegrins, but not exclusively towards us. They also have a hate boner for the believers of ""false faith"" (muslims), ""dirty latins"" (catholics). These are their words, not mine. This same organization has sainted war criminals such as [Slobodan Šiljak](https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slobodan_%C5%A0iljak) and [Milorad Vukojičić](https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milorad_Vukoji%C4%8Di%C4%87). It also sheltered and protected numerous war criminals, most notorious of which were Ratko Mladić and Radovan Karadžić. On top of that, in addition to the Serbian state, it is also doing it's very best to present the Chetniks, as an anti-fascist movement.

Anyway, what best sums up Amfilohije's, and SOC's views of Montenegro and Montenegrins is the following quote : When asked about the prospect of a independent Montenegro in 2005, his response was ""you don't make a pie out of shit""

To sum everything up, what we have here is a well organized, orchestrated propaganda war towards Montenegro. Harsh words, I know, but true nonetheless. Just use google translate, and go to some of the most popular Serbian media-outlets, and look for the most popular news in the last week. I recommend sites such as kurir.rs , blic.rs, informer.rs, b92.rs , alo.rs , etc. All of them have the same news, and all of them spew nonsense and hatred. The most common themes are that Montenegro is on the verge of civil war, and they all but try to paint a picture of a genocidal campaign being undertaken against Serbs in Montenegro. How deep this goes is best exemplified by the case of priest they claimed was severely beaten by our police. Police denied it, and so did the priest in question, yet that disgusting lie meant to incite an uprising is to this day being presented as the truth!


Given all that, I can't help but say that the law is far too lax. It is also a dire necessity, as evidenced by the response to it, provided by Serbian state officials, SOC and Serbian media.

4601,"There are good reasons she was found guilty by court of law,most  key one video evidence i, mentioned in the BBC article.

There are three key evidence against the Briton, that are decisive. 

The first was the fact that one of the accused for the rape had a time stamp photo of the time of being with his girlfriend in another area. https://meaww.com/selfie-girlfriend-saves-18-year-old-israeli-from-rape-charge-brit-teenager-cypress

Here is what he claims:

&gt;I was with my Israeli girlfriend at the time but the police still connected me to it.

&gt;'When they came to arrest my friends they thought I was with this woman too.

&gt;'Apparently when she was shown my picture she said that I was there as well.

&gt;'It was all lies. It had nothing to do with me.

&gt;The police just believed that she was saying. But you saw that in the end she admitted she lied but it hasn't worked out so well for her.'
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7309649/Selfie-proved-wasnt-rapist-Israeli-freed-Brits-gang-rape-claim-tells-ordeal.html

The second, and decisive on its own, is the video that shows her having consensual sex with 3 of the accused of which is the only DNA of others that was found on her body. This video has been leaked, I haven't seen it, but British commentators who claim to have seen it, in sites with comments (yeah I know not high quality outlet) like dailymail, also claim it is consensual and that is how the content of the video has been consistently described, rather than depicting rape. I haven't seen any source describing it as rape. This video has been used by the authorities to determine it wasn't rape. How is it justice to ignore fucking video evidence and support a false accusation of rape just because of the ethnicity of the accuser or pushing racist falsehoods the country this has happened? Incidentally she was 19 and the men who had sex with her were younger, one 15. Though she is called teenager. Incidentally, the Israeli teens were those arrested first and were released due to the video evidence. In the Israeli press on the mean time the same narrative accusing of how outrageous and evil the Cypriot justice system was for arresting them and that it was out to get them. Catch 22 between two prejudiced narratives. If they were guilty of rape and video evidence did not clear them, I expect a narrative about antisemitism instead. In either case the right thing to do is to act based on evidence and resist pressure of malignant actors trying to exert pressure against propet justice through defamation/false accusations.

the bbc article says:

&gt;*Her lawyers had argued* that the video found on some of the Israelis' phones showed her having consensual sex with one of the group while others tried to enter the room as she told them to leave.


Then there is the retraction statement she signed, but the video itself is more decisive. Now, she claims of pressure but she did sign it. My opinion is that the cops concluded that she was lying since she was called after the video evidence, and time stamp pictures (judge also said inconsistencies with testimony, for example after the time stamp photo she might have changed her story)  and indeed pressured her to sign a retraction statement. She claims she asked for a lawyer, the cops said she didn't. I am going to be fair here and claim we don't know, perhaps she was right. But considering the above two facts of video, time stamp photo, she is not trustworthy. Cops worldwide can be assholes to get people to sign what they want. She claims she was treated with sensitivity until the video evidence period when the cops pressured her to recant, my own view is they were ambivalent until time stamp plus video convinced the cops she was lying. 

I think some commentators here are running on identity and prejudice, rather than the evidence. Seems moderators deleted some of the more racist of those posts.Before making racist spewing statements about court systems for a case not ending how you like, maybe you should acknowledge the evidence.Else you are detrimental influence on justice   I would love to blame entirely the way it is reported, and it plays some role but at least the video is mentioned. This part directed more on some other commentators here and elsewhere than just you.

The Cypriot women right activists who appeared there as protestors are similar. Just because she is a woman they assume she is a victim. Instead of evidence, they go with identity. Imagine a justice system based 
on identity than the facts.

Anyhow. 

In the video it is claimed it is said: 

&gt;“You’re my whore, say you’re my whore,” one of the men allegedly said.

&gt;When the British woman asks them to translate, one of the teenagers replied in English, “We are saying you’re sexy.’”


Considering the above and them taking the video, the Israelis were assholes, she got offended and falsely accused them of rape because she didn't like the fact that they filmed her, she must have concluded they disrespected her.

Punishing her for the false accusation was correct. Obviously on a moral perspective you can behave in ways that are an asshole  that aren't a crime but are immoral. Just because the Israelis were assholes didn't justify a false accusation. It is in the interest of justice to punish false rape accusations. 

This isn't a case of a rape victim being punished. There is fucking video evidence, one of those accused was of a photo time stamp in a different location. Even Jessie Smollett kept denying his lies and accused cops. Evidence matters.

&gt;Throwing possible rape-victims in prison is not something I want to see inside EU.


Video evidence, time stamp photo, signed recant, stronger evidence for false rape accusations don't often come by.

Based on available evidence, you don't want prison as punishment in the EU for false rape accusers. Someone will always claim possible rape victim and deny everything. I disagree, it is just and compatible with European values to punish them. But only if there are strong evidence. Go where the evidence can get you.
If evidence showed rape, I would support the rapists being punished.

4686,"&gt; No because it would 100s different companies who would provide service for money and they would compete for that tax money.

In an ideal world: yes. In reality: under the table deals where companies convieniently end, when their competitor starts plus if you're a giant like let's say t-mobile you can buy the tiny company that starts threatening your status quo.

&gt; Sorry but back then roads also had to be maintained and roads were waaaaay more expensive than today. 

Not true, actual roads you use to commute to work, aren't the same as the back alley ones from the main roads to your house ^^which ^^are ^^relatively ^^cheap, cost a lot to upkeep, cause it isn't like in ye olde days where 100 horse carts a day was a busy day, but nowdays every decent road has at least 100 cars per hour, so to have it in good condition, you would visit a toll booth every country.

&gt; Already explained. The only reason why we don't have problem with food industry is because it is completely private. I live in Poland under communism food was nationalized and we had frequent problems with food production and price.

Are you geniuenly playing dumb or are you dumb, cause you're comparing apples to fish, both are food, but not the same i.e. food industry and schools, public utilities are to totally different things, one should be of course privatised, the other should never be privatised.

&gt; Yes because companies care most about their profits it would ensure that medicine and healthcare would be cheapest because they fear that someone new will pop up and reduce prices all around and make them go out of business.

Works perfectly well in America, where one does of Insulin costs 230$, compared to [INSERT EUROPEAN COUNTRY], where you go to your local farmacy and it costs 10$ to buy a pack of insulin. And the sad reality starts only there: a ride with an ambulance to the hospital 5k, basic procedures 800$ and so on, but yeah, they'll definetly lower the prices due to competitions

&gt; You are already paying for that in taxes. The difference is that instead of receiving 100 something for your 100 in taxes you receive only 60 because 40 is wasted by government and beurocracy. Here is simple math for you: Doctors + nurses + hospitals + ministry of health + rank and file beurocrats. Now cut down ministry of health and beurocrats. Does medicine and healthcare gets cheaper or more expensive ?. Cheaper.

That's what it would look like in a perfect world, but the reality is... just look at how great the US Semi private healtcare is.

&gt; Socialism has to itself that as disease doesn't spare anyone. Economist today are completely different breed of economist and no economist from 1900 would even allow those people to make any law.

Holy fuck i want some of your drugs you're taking.

&gt; That is how socialist economist thinks. He thinks that governments should have income. No. Government should have bills to pay from which tax rate is set. If there is extra money then that money should be returned to people which paid that extra money. It is completely unacceptable that government ""balances"" budget by changing one tax income to another. It is typical socialist thievery.

As i mentioned earlier: You think that way, until you realize how much is paid back by the goverment and how many jobs the goverments directly or in directly creates, which in poland equals to: **ALMOST 2 MILLION JOBS or 5.3% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION**

I won't point out the whole paragraf, about the wild wild west prior to WW1 in Europe and so on, *but why do you think those things happen?

4712,"I don't think you understand percentages.  
  
Firstly, what the employer pays in pension contributions are completely irrelevant in this - You'd never be entitled to that money as salary.  
  
These figures will not be perfect but they're not far off:  
  
Apparently the average gross salary (before tax) in Poland is around 60k PLN.  
  
Your first deductions are 11.26% for Pension Insurance and then 2.45% for Sickness Insurance. Don't start to add these percentages up, as that's not how it works.  
  
11.26% of 60,000 = 6,756.  
  
You now have 53,244.  
  
2.45% of 53,244 = 1,304.48  
  
You now have 51939.52.  
  
Next is income tax. Tax rates are 18% up to 85,828 and anything over that is taxed at 32%.  
  
Your remaining income is below the higher threshold, so you are charged as:  
  
18% of 51,939.52 = 9,349.11  
  
You now have 42,590.41.  
  
I appreciate that taxes on fuel, alcohol and cigarettes are higher than standard VAT, that is normally charged at 23%. However, there are plenty of products at reduced rates of 5% or even zero-rated products. 5% VAT applies for common food items like dairy products, meat and fish.  
  
So, let's assume you spend all of your income while also paying 23% VAT. This is absolutely ridiculous, but let's just do it for effect.  
  
You buy 42,590.41 of products and pay 23% in tax. 9,795.80 goes to the government.  
  
You can't just add percentages up. So we'll do it properly.  
  
You paid:  
  
6756 in Pension Insurance
1304.48 in Sickness Insurance  
9,349.11 in Income Tax  
9795.80 in VAT (Sales Tax)  
  
Total taxes paid are 27,205.39  
  
(27,205.39 ÷ 60,000) × 100 = 45.34%  
  
The maximum amount of tax you would pay is 45.34%.  
  
But, as said earlier, that amount of spending attracting the full VAT rate is pretty ridiculous and unrealistic.

There's actually a serious issue with charging rates below the market rate. You're essentially guaranteeing that, if you aren't constantly vigilant and present, that your apartment will be sublet or if you're in a touristy area, that it will be rented out on Air BnB. 

You can't fight market forces. You can't make places that are attractive to live in or attractive to visit cheap. It just doesn't work. What you can do is make those places less attractive.

The primary way to do this is to build more housing. More housing means more traffic, more crowding, more noise but if this works, you now have empty housing which is a bit of an issue.

You can also try to make different places more attractive, though that's significantly more difficult given that no one wants to be in the transitional wave of people that need to come before a place can become an attractive place to live.",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/ehapz7/young_people_in_spain_need_to_spend_94_of_salary/fck1qdd/,neohellpoet,1577713920

So the problem IS the economy.

Like i said. Because of socialism, families lost strong economic bond that tied them together. IT was something more than people feelings that kept family unit together. For poor families kids were valuable assets. For price of 4-5 years of food you could have small worker for family, like cattle it would increase family wealth and with each year that kid would provide more and more for family. Kid was the best investment poor families could have in order to escape from poverty.

Thanks to socialism not only you are taken away reason to have kids but also kids belong to state and their slave owner wants them to not work but sit in schools till they are 18 or 22 which means that family can't get their return on investment until nearly 20 years instead of 5 and it is not even sure there will be return on investement as when kid hits 18-22 he starts to think about his starting his own family so in the end family could in fact only get something when they will get old.

4843,"&gt;The EU must confront an “existential” problem of population decline faced by a swath of its member states, Croatia’s prime minister has warned.  Andrej Plenkovic, the country’s centre-right prime minister, told the Financial Times that countries including his own were grappling with a shrinking population and rural depopulation because of low birth rates and emigration to more prosperous regions.  The population fell in 10 of the 28 EU member states in 2018, including Croatia, Latvia, Bulgaria and Romania, according to Eurostat, the EU’s statistics agency.  “This is a structural, almost an existential problem for some nations, and we are not the only one,” said Mr Plenkovic in an interview in Brussels. “We are losing a city of 15,000, 16,000 people per year just by the fact that we have 15,000, 16,000 more deaths than births. For a country of around 4m, that is a lot, right? Plus we have freedom of movement now”.     
&gt;  
&gt;Croatia, the EU’s newest member, is the fifth-fastest shrinking country in the world, and is set to lose 17 per cent of its 2017 population by 2050, according to the UN.  Lower birth rates are one cause, but so is emigration. Between 2013, when Croatia joined the EU, and 2017, approximately 5 per cent of the country’s population moved to other member states.  Croatia wants to put demographics at the heart of its agenda for the EU during its six-month presidency of the bloc starting in January. Zagreb also successfully pushed for its EU commissioner, Dubravka Suica, to receive a portfolio dealing with democracy and demography.  Mr Plenkovic wants Brussels to examine which countries are most affected and what policies and measures have been implemented to boost birth rates, helping the EU to confront the problem.  “We really did a lot in terms of demographic politics, tax, childcare, amounts of money that we give to parents for motherhood, etc — we are doing as much as we can. But I think we should do something at the European level,” he said.  EU cohesion policies would also be critical to addressing the problem, he added.

4867,"&gt;See, you were wrong with your first sentence, believing that something like birth rate is a black-and-white absolute.

I don't believe it is completely black and white but pension system is responsible for 85% of those issues.

The other 15% is public forced education which further changes kids from investment of family and asset to liability.


Previously in few years since birth children would start to work with their parents helping them, which meant that like cattle kids were investement that had ROI.

Since socialists took over they outlawed kids work which means that until kid hits 18-20 it is liability to family and as usual the poorest are the one hurting the most because previously if they were poor they could make 5 children and quickly rise out of poverty by share combined force of 7 people but now 5 children are liebility till they are 20 and poor family simply doesn't have the money to support 5 children.

4869,"&gt;Pure kafka: EU parliamentarians take plane or train to Strasbourg, drivers chase empty cars to pick them up  
&gt;  
&gt;A large proportion of the 120 or so cars driven from Brussels to Strasbourg for the monthly plenary session of the European Parliament make this journey without passengers. A spokeswoman for the Parliament has confirmed this to the German news agency dpa.  
&gt;  
&gt;Members of the European Parliament move from Brussels to Strasbourg every month for the plenary sessions of their assembly. The Parliament's chauffeur service then also makes that 450 km journey. The approximately 120 cars are driven to Strasbourg, so that the elected members can be brought from the airport or station to the Parliament.  
&gt;  
&gt;Most of these 120 cars, with the exception of the driver, remain completely empty during that journey. Only a few of the 751 Members of the European Parliament take the opportunity to travel to Strasbourg with them. For example, for the November part-session barely 25 elected members were taken on board. During the other months, too, that number is rather low.  
&gt;  
&gt;The spokeswoman for the European Parliament defends this practice. She says that 'in the interests of sound financial management' it is not advisable to station cars in Strasbourg. She also stresses that most of them are electric or hybrid cars.  
&gt;  
&gt;The monthly movements of people between Brussels and Strasbourg have long been the subject of criticism because they are considered expensive and not very environmentally friendly.

I don't claim to know the rates of Western Europe salaries, legislation of each n' every member state, I'm venting how this could be resolved without additional government programs or lynching, and prevent civil unrest.

---------------------
Motto: ***”I don't have to rent it to you if you don't like the rent, I can wait for someone else or not rent at all.”***


**Resolve #1 (a)**  – Parity prices based on taxes &amp; dues

The tax for rents is set at €100 (for one room + kitchen, WC, whatever else; OR just in general for anything regardless of rooms). The renters can't ask for less than €100 (*obviously*) and, according to parity prices based on taxes &amp; dues, the most they can ask is €200; so that €100 is obligatory for taxes/dues, while €100 maximum for renters.


**Resolve #1 (b)** – Fractional prices based on taxes &amp; dues 

The tax for rents is set at €100 (for one room + kitchen, WC, whatever else; OR just in general for anything regardless of rooms). The renters can't ask for more than a specific % based on that tax. Renters can't ask less than €100 and, according to fractional prices, they cannot ask for a specific % of what has been decided (supposedly, one that doesn't exceed another €100 because then it would be a parity pricing).


**Resolve 2** – Affordable housing

The general thought for many when they think how to solve any housing crisis &amp; don't care of how fluctuations work on the market in response to these residential facilities.


**Resolve 3 (a)** – Legislative complementaries in regards to renters &amp; against predatory renting

Supposedly, a renter doesn't manage to find any tenants, while underhandedly they give the excuse to potential tenants that they can wait indefinitely without renting (despite rent announcements). This will require an agency's oversight (same as it is with food quality) for renters, especially unwilling ones that ”can wait”. Some of these can be, depending on the situation:             
\- a registry for tenants of every willing (and unwilling) renter to choose from where they want to live, which of course this will be a ”*first come, first serve*” outcome for every tenant;                   
\- (unwilling) renters are given a month or two at their disposal to find tenants, should they can't find anyone, then those 
tenants who came to search rent on that aforementioned registry are appointed to that renter, thus rendering that renter's underhanded excuse of ”waiting indefinitely” null;               
\- if renters aren't complying with the new legislative measures in regards to rents, then an ultimatum is neccesary: quickly sell the unused property on the market/to the authorities at a discount or face eminent domain without compensation;         
\- the aforementioned go the same (bar some other specifications) for commercial rents in order to make sure goods &amp; services aren't overpriced because of renters, and to protect small-medium businesses from commercial predatory renting (*surely not a lot of people thought about this, the next time they wonder why are goods' &amp; services' prices so ridiculously inflated compared to flea markets*) that can affect their goods and/or services towards customers.


**Resolve 3 (b)** – Legislative complementaries in regards to tenants' protections

Eventually, you'll need protections for tenants against asinine renters. I think every Western country has them so I'll leave it up to you, then.         
As for the obligations part, it may be a requirement requested from potential tenants in case they have to use the registry due to the sheer number of unwilling renters (*eg.* they want to get work in the city).


**Resolve 4** – Legislative complementaries in regards to real estate developers

It will be neccesary for, again, an agency oversight to make sure any new buildings (residential, commercial...) aren't used for money laundering &amp; making sure of accounting, in order to be sure that their price tag isn't unwarrantly, artificially, inflated while in development.

5200,"&gt;The biggest flaw of the EU is that its political structure is impossibly complicated to understand even for educated people.

It's not, actually. However, the media and our educational systems have failed to inform us about it. 

First, a 'normal' democracy: you, the citizen of your country, have to follow laws your country makes. Since you have to follow those laws, it's only reasonable that you have a voice in how those laws are made. You follow the law = you have a voice in creating the law. That's the rule in a normal democracy. 

But, the EU is not like a country. In the EU, PEOPLE have to follow laws, but STATES have to follow the laws as well. So there is not ONE group, there are TWO. Both are equally important. 

This makes creating a democratic system difficult. How do we create a system in which both the PEOPLE and STATES are represented fairly and equally? 

Well, first, it's logical to give both groups their own bodies. So, the PEOPLE are represented in Parliament, and the STATES are represented in the Council. Here is the catch: give the PEOPLE (read: Parliament) the right to enact legislation and... well... the STATES are, in comparison, weaker than the PEOPLE. So giving Parliament the right to enact legislation doesn't work; it would mean both the PEOPLE and the STATES are not on the same level of power. 

Thus, a new body should be formed that does have that right. This body should represent the PEOPLE **AND** the STATES. That's the Commission. Only the Commission has the right to enact legislation, because only the Commission represents both the STATES and the PEOPLE. Our representatives *have* to make backroom deals with the representatives of the states, because otherwise there would be an inbalance of power. 

&gt;It would make more sense if the head of the EU commission were popularly elected 

If the Commission were to be elected directly, it would mean the Council would lose power. The Council represents the states, meaning: the states lose power. The states losing power over the EU means, simply put, less sovereignty. 

I'm all for a federation, so I would support the idea of directly voting on the Commission. But I'm not sure if you actually want that, though. Calling for the direct election of the Commission is the same thing as calling for more integration and placing the mandate of governance on the EU instead of your national government.",Erdogan small PP,/r/europe/comments/eh8hxw/what_are_the_biggest_flaws_of_the_eu/fcj6grm/,CreeperCooper,1577678449

They also have an incentive to build mostly for the middle-class and above, because the working class and those with lower incomes (such as single young people) have lower purchasing power, and thus can contribute less to profits.

To solve the housing crisis you need a massive buildout of affordable housing. Only the state can do that. Look at Singapore's housing corporation for inspiration. They have a near-monopoly on housing and do their job well.

You also have to remember that people were talking about this being a problem long before we ever heard of Rotherham, they were just called crazy racists and the issue was ignored.

Then you also have the fact that the police is apparently afraid to deal with any issue pretty much uniquely relating to specific ethnic or religious groups. Most of the West thankfully hasn't gone *that* far down the crazy-road (yet at least).

The UK media is also downright shit when it comes to reporting on things relating to immigrants, refugees, certain non-British ethnicities, certain religions etc. They've been at least as afraid as the British police apparently have..

The concept that our judiciary is impartial is demonstrably false, all legal decisions have some degree of political aspect to them and when you have a judiciary with less diversity than the BNP you end up with individuals making political decisions based on their own views that people have no way of scrutinizing or any mechanism for recourse.

Since introduction of pension system people think when they will get old they will get security from state instead of family.

It took a while for this idea to take a root so old people who didn't live in socialism in war times were not fooled by this horseshit and strongly believed that kids was their only security.

Unfortunutelly socialism is so advanced now that this disease took over brains of people and they seriously believe it is state not family that should keep them safe when they are old.

So why the hell you should get kids ? Without state it was normal to have 5 kids because there was strong possibility that 2-3 of them wouldn't live toward their 30-40s and kept you safe and cost of keeping you safe would be spread out among them.

The report conducted by the European Union Agency for Human Rights on anti-Semitism is an interesting read;

“(...) over half (59%) of the cases of anti-Semitic violence they [the 2,700 members of the Jewish community questioned] have experienced in the past year [2018], were perpetuated by someone with a Muslim extremist view”.

However, the FRA report differs a little from other reports on anti-Semitism by suggesting that left-wing anti-Semitic harassment is actually more prevalent than right-wing anti-Semitic harassment.

“(...) one third of all cases of anti-Semitic harassment (...) were perpetrated by ‘someone with a Muslim extremist view’. About one in five point to ‘someone with a left-wing political view’ and about one in seven to ‘someone with a right-wing political view’”.

5502,"&gt; Its way way overrepresented with pakistani brits making up 1% of the population.

Show me reliable data that Pakistani men overrepresented child rape in Britain, I ask for reliable because all studies I've seen note that their data is inherently unreliable when it comes to ethnic breakdown. It's also been found that ethnicity is more likely to be recorded if the perpetrators are of an ethnic minority, i.e. white men aren't recorded as white men.

&gt; I don't think you understand the difference in absolute and proportionate.

I do and it changes nothing. White men perpetrate the majority of child sexual abuse, proportionally. Not only that but when it comes to the victims it's irrelevant, they don't care who's raping them per capita.

By convincing people they should focus on ""Pakistani men"" you're pushing attention away from the wider picture and the kind of people kids are more likely to become victims of.

&gt; It's Pakistani Muslims men.


I can only assume you've based this on the media because the data doesn't (currently) support it.

&gt; CLAIM: Pakistani men are disproportionately involved in _grooming gangs_.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; CONCLUSION: Some studies have found that a disproportionate number of offenders and suspected offenders in child grooming gangs are categorised as being of Asian ethnicity and most don’t break this down any further so we can’t know if they are Pakistani. But __all of the studies stress that the data isn’t good enough to know whether this is a true reflection of offenders in these cases.__

Child abuse grooming *gangs* appear to be overwhelmingly Asian, grooming of children for abuse is not.

More from that page:

&gt; At first glance this would seem to suggest that the group identified as Asian are overrepresented (compared to the proportion of Asian people in the general population) but CEOP said that the data was too inconsistent to draw “national conclusions” from.

Its no surprise that politicians ended up taking a simple approach to the problem. With it many doctors, nurses and professionals have contributed. It can't be viewed as only a negative thing. 

If you didn't view this as a game of skins and merely the passage of time you might be less worried. I am a complex point associated with East London. I know why my Grandma moved out, I know how that passage of time played out, why it did, how it is now, a vague understanding of what it was then. Is much lost? Its different but the sadness is not more sorrow and the cheer not much less gaudy.   
I'm not mad about it, what's the need to be? I don't feel as though my skin defines me, what does it matter who lives in that house now?    

I am a combination of a Uralic strain combined with arbitrary Germanic, Anglo-Saxon, Norse, Norman and then British culture. This isn't a popular combination, I don't have a team, if I did we'd really struggle for numbers.  
When I read the works of Shakespeare (I've done a fair bit of am-dram) they don't speak to me because they're mostly the whispers of a bygone culture, an older root that was abandoned, agrarian terms and terminology that's alien to me. My own culture is not my own. My English ancestors were forced from their lands by the crown into the cities seeking work.  
This is when I start to understand the culture more, and familiar faces appear; the working-week as opposed to the harvest cycle, social structures to enable the working classes, the merchants, the professionals. However there's still a crazy maritime off-shoot that means nothing to me. Much of our lexicon is trapped into a distilled time-frame that means nothing to me. Shanghaied, Slice the mainbrace, these are the words of half of my ancestry but the words mean nothing, their way of living defunct. I'm no merchant navy.  
So when you ask me what my identity **IS**, its nothing in particular, its a way of thinking and one I've found in urban cities like Jakarta or Calcutta or Berlin or New York as much as I've found anywhere else.  
So I shed no tears for this story, as long as people are thinking, I trust the future generations to do what they always do, question their elders and re-imagine the present and change things about what their parents did.

But than why in the case of admitting Bulgaria and Romania in the Schengen Area, when we have met all the criteria since 2011 and all EU and EEA members and Switzerland have voted in favor of letting us in and only the Netherlands has been vetoing us in the last couple of years. How is this different and does not apply with the voting system you have provided?

Also with Article 7 against Hungary and Poland when it is needed unanimous vote to pass and both of them have said they will veto each other's cases, making it practically impossible for it to pass, making it useless as it is impossible to implement, since whichever the case member will be, there will be always at least one other member on their side.

And up until recently with the veto of starting membership talks with Albania from a couple of members and North Macedonia from one.

There are also other examples. The question is why are they different from the voting system set by the EU in the official website you have provided where it says:  ""The blocking minority must include at least four Council members representing **more than 35% of the EU population**.""

I will concede, though, that the maturity levels between a 20 year old and 16 year old might be similar if they both grew up in a quiet rural area.

5596,"&gt;And if they are, that's supporting my point.

No it's not. They're a tax haven for INTERNATIONAL companies. meaning companies from US and other places come to netherlands and pay dutch taxes, they don't avoid all taxes completely.

Why ? Because they're lower than the US ones.  They improve dutch economy by far.

&gt;If they're not, or not anymore, then someone high up wasn't happy with the situation, don't you think?

No. Dutch government was plenty happy. EU wasn't. 

&gt;Here's a link to a New York Times article on the subject.

Which if you actually read it, says exactly what I say. Some quotes from it

&gt;For tax avoidance purposes, the Netherlands offers the status of a European country, while allowing big multinationals, like Google and Ikea, to move global profits through Dutch subsidiaries, drastically lowering their tax payments.

Exactly what I said isn't it ? They pay taxes. Dutch taxes

&gt;. In addition, legislators must close loopholes to avoid breaching new European Union rules that take effect in 2019.

As I said, the only reason they're doing it is EU rules. Not that ""someone high up wasn't happy""

&gt;Those business-friendly practices help explain why the Netherlands, with a population of 17 million, attracts more foreign investment than some much larger countries, like France and Germany. In 2017, the Netherlands ranked fourth worldwide in the amount of foreign direct investment into the country.

Why ? Lower taxes. Among other things such as respectable courts and less corruption.

&gt;Nike has used the Netherlands to significantly reduce the taxes it pays on sales outside the United States, according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. (The New York Times is a member of the consortium.)

Exactly what I said again. They pay it in Netherlands because it's cheaper.

&gt;At least until recently, the Dutch Finance Ministry was a willing enabler for such arrangements. Corporate accountants and lawyers could call at the ministry for preapproval of their strategies. The Netherlands long justified its laws by arguing that they encouraged multinational companies to establish their headquarters in the country, creating jobs and investment.

Dutch government was a full and willing participant. And it worked great for dutch economy. 

They're stopping because of the EU wide rules, not because they want.

And even now they're fighting against it! Why ? Because it works for the dutch economy. It's good for the dutch economy.

&gt;“The Netherlands is not serious about ending its tax haven status,” said Sven Giegold, a German member of the European Parliament who is the Green Party’s spokesman on tax policy. He noted that the Netherlands had resisted attempts to prevent European countries from competing to have the lowest corporate rate.

And why are they lowering it such as we previously said from 25 to 21% ? 

Answer is easy.

&gt;Tax cuts in the United States also affect the appeal of the Dutch system.

[Ella Cockbain](https://policinginsight.com/analysis/when-bad-evidence-is-worse-than-no-evidence-quilliams-grooming-gangs-report-and-its-legacy/) is also a researcher who studies child sexual exploitation who gets repeatedly ignored by people who want to blame certain ethnicities or religious groups.

You know why nothing will be done? Because people want to blame ethnicity and religion instead of acknowledging that child sexual exploitation is done by groups from all ethnic and religious backgrounds and that the police in the UK see the vulnerable children on the streets and from broken homes as ""trash"" and ""prostitutes"" instead of rape victims, and some even participate in the abuse themselves.",,/r/europe/comments/eh3bl3/grooming_epidemic_as_almost_19000_children/fcfywpi/,Wolphoenix,1577634998

[Ella Cockbain](https://policinginsight.com/analysis/when-bad-evidence-is-worse-than-no-evidence-quilliams-grooming-gangs-report-and-its-legacy/) is also a researcher who studies child sexual exploitation who gets repeatedly ignored by people who want to blame certain ethnicities or religious groups.

You know why nothing will be done? Because people want to blame ethnicity and religion instead of acknowledging that child sexual exploitation is done by groups from all ethnic and religious backgrounds and that the police in the UK see the vulnerable children on the streets and from broken homes as ""trash"" and ""prostitutes"" instead of rape victims, and some even participate in the abuse themselves.",,/r/europe/comments/eh3bl3/grooming_epidemic_as_almost_19000_children/fcg09gj/,Wolphoenix,1577635330

5943,"This is key, some people were married off young in order to secure themselves a future. They didn't have (or need) the same educational rigour we have today. As such, it was seen as less essential for people to wait until 18 to marry off. There's a reason for example, that traditionally a Bat Mitzvah happens at 12 for girls and a Bar Mitzvah at 13 for boys in Jewish culture.

Children were not necessarily married off at 12-14 years old, but it was not unheard of. As we know, some eastern cultures traditionally practiced arranged marriage between children under 16 (usually between 14-16) and even western cultures did so to an extent - though this was primarily an aristocratic practice. In many Roman Catholic countries however, the age of consent for marriage and sex remains (or remained until recently) 14 or 15, based on the fact this is when 'sexual maturity' is seen as complete.

Boys are typically seen as less mature than girls culturally and often required more education or training in order to enter a specific profession. Whereas girls might be married off very young (in that 12-14 age bracket sometimes), boys would typically only marry once they reached 'maturity' between 14-16, and while it is impossible to gauge the true scale of the matter, it is probably unlikely that most people had sexual experiences that often prior to adulthood.

It is always important to remember that the purpose of marriage has always culturally differed, in many traditional societies it was seen as a way to build a cultural and financial alliance between two families. Today it is mainly viewed as a sexual and romantic endeavour with financial consequences. Whereas in the past divorce would be seen as a problem regarding finances with lesser emotional attachment, the increased availability of divorce in the west today means that divorce is seen as an emotional matter with lesser (but still significant) financial consequences.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/eh3bl3/grooming_epidemic_as_almost_19000_children/fcf9y92/,Wardiazon,1577627900

5980,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_culture#In_India

India has a rape culture rooted in both its traditional Indian culture as well as its British colonial legacy, which blames victims of rape, is sympathetic to perpetrators, and which treats women who have been raped as ""damaged goods"" who then suffer further afterwards.[115] While there are laws on the books to protect victims of rape, these laws are often not enforced, especially when the perpetrator is from a more powerful caste or is wealthier than the person who was raped, there is often a failure to properly gather evidence from rape victims and to care for them afterwards, and there is little legal assistance for them.[116][117] Two main types of rape that are prevalent in Indian Society which are political rapes and honor (izzat) rapes. Beyond the typical type of assault for dominance and control, comes rape with the intention of revenge. Because women are not seen as individuals but rather as objects or possessions, rape is sometimes a political move to seek revenge against an enemy. Fights and feuds are settled by raping the rival's mother, wife, daughter or sister. Honor rapes are used as a tactic to take away sometime of value belonging to the woman. Because women are seen as objects for men to possess, taking away her honor through rape diminishes her worth. The societal attitude of linking a woman’s celibacy with family honor compels her to safeguard the family’s honor in India. However, in the case of rape, instead of endeavoring to transform male-dominated, socially constructed, biased attitudes, people expect women to change by demanding that they dress properly or restrict their activities.[118][119]

Historically in India, journalistic coverage of rape and sexual abuse has been limited and typically prejudiced against the victim. Women victims who reported rape were seen as people who do not believe in preserving the honor of their family. The victim often fights a lonely battle against her tormentor where justice is not delivered timely. The increase in media coverage of the 2012 Delhi gang rape case helped to draw attention to the prevalence of sexual brutality towards women in India.[120]

According to NCRB 2015 statistics, Madhya Pradesh has the highest raw number of rape reports among Indian states,[121] while Jodhpur has the highest per capita rate of rape reports in cities.[122]",,/r/europe/comments/eh3bl3/grooming_epidemic_as_almost_19000_children/fcfb6zv/,Grasswalker,1577628297
