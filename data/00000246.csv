96,"Here is some random facts regarding Danish telephone booths:

- the first Danish public available phones was made available in 1886 - but the first booths was made available in 1930

- in 1977 all the doors was removed from the telephone booths in the greater Copenhagen area because of a series of incidents with pipe bombs that triggered when the door was opened.

- in 1978 the perpetrator was captured at a leftist rally when one of the pipe bombs exploded in his hand and blew of three fingers. He turned out to be a 19 year old high school student with right wing sympathies. He had used old instructions from the WW2 Danish resistance groups to construct the bombs.

- the pipe bomb incidents led the Danish military to purchase the first remote controlled bomb defusal robot. It was named “Rullemarie” (English: “Rolling Marie”). 

- the latest (and last) version of the Danish telephone booth was designed by Jørn Utzon (the architect behind the Sydney Opera House) and his son.

- the last telephone booth was situated in the city center of Aarhus and not Copenhagen. The telephone in it had been removed the year before..

Yes, and they do not have for mission to find the responsible of the attack. How convenient ?

&gt; There are two sides to every situation. They still do not have 100% concrete proof that Assad launched these strikes. 

You never have 100% concrete proof that something is happening, especially in an area under siege by a regime that doesn’t want you there. 

All you have are a body of evidence and facts, and all of those can tell you a story. There is one possible story with what we know, and it puts the blame on Assad. 

If it wasn’t Assad, then who was it ? who was it for Assad to refuse an investigation putting the blame on him ? 

How would the rebels, under siege for month, be able to launch this attack on their own ? While the Assad government has the weapon, the mean to manufacture the weapon, has already used the weapon no later than last year, and the reason to use it.

188,"There is strategic interest to the usage of gas attacks. Firstly, terrify peoples. The local organisation (Jaich al-Islam) refused to negotiate to surrender before the attack. Those chemical attacks changed their mind as Yasser Delwane member of the political office of Jaich al-Islam said to AFP. 



It is also very useful to move people outside of their shelters, the gas (or the set of gas) being heavier than air, someone hiding underground (for example) is not protected. Once an individual flee the gas by going outside then more conventional weapons can be used to eliminate said individual. Said individual would have likely chances to die from the gas if he stays in hiding) 



Now for speculations :
It may also be a test of the western reaction: we all remember the ""red line"" from Obama which was given up by himself shortly after. Maybe the perpetrators of these chemical attacks wanted to see what could happen, and if the answers were ""nothing"" then they could do anything without fear of retaliation from western powers.



It should be noted than local population were trained by non governmental organizations into trying to mitigate the effects of chemical attacks. This training was done after the ""red line"" event.

204,"British foreign policy has a way to be seen neutral, or inexistent. But they are there. Look at the massive investment they have in Azerbaijan and the interests they have there from a geopolitical point of view. Also check the curious selection of languages BBC News broadcasts - look how the majority just happen to be ridden with conflict and are strategic.

&gt; On a general picture they agree, though one side continues to provide weapons to both sides to continue fueling the conflict and one side refuses to sell weapons to Azerbaijan and this is the same country that prohibited aid to Azerbaijan (the only post-Soviet country to not receive aid) because of lobbying work. Back to Russia, they aren't that far from showing their bias when their weapon sales to Azerbaijan are at foot kicking prices and then they turn around to the other side by subsidizing weapon sales to Armenia, at times giving Armenia weapons at the cost of nothing.

But you are going with the assumption that the US and Russia do not agree with Russia selling weapon to both sides and the US having an embargo in place. I *paraphrase* from memory a quote coming from a US Department of State (ex)official ""the Karabakh conflict is one of the very few foreign policy issues we see eye to eye with the Russians."" They obviously agree with how things are being done most probably with one of the main goals, in my opinion, being that of keeping Iran off the South Caucasus - a goal both super powers probably share. Therefore arming both countries to the teeth is probably something that the US wants as well. The weapons prices could very well be also the arrangement they all have with Russia. The region is complex though. Much more than a simple narrative can adequately describe. 

Also Armenia depending on Russia is not exactly in Armenia's favour either. Russia plays a balancing role - to keep both equal. That is not benefitting Armenia, nor Azerbaijan. It is benefitting Russia first. In 1994 there was no balance, the Armenian side won and had superiority, and yet it was precisely Russia which blocked them to push for something more than a ceasefire, from which point Russia's balancing role began. 

&gt;  it's only Armenia who can benefit from the west by introducing a religious twist

Oh it absolutely can for example in the US and yet for some weird reason this is not being done with the outcry of a sector of right wing Armenians in the US. Point is that there is no effective policy of Christian solidarity in existence. Really, there is none. Check the answers in one of the latest threads on ARF in the Armenia sub which actually touch on this.

&gt;&gt; unlike Pakistan

&gt;You just acknowledged that Pakistan has ""realpolitik"" incentives for their relations with Turkey and Azerbaijan.

Yes. The issue is not the real reason why they do what they do. The issue is that they officially use religion to this end.

&gt; Turkey is nowhere near an Iran 2.0. Turkey is evermore so becoming authoritarian and dictatorial in a way similar to Azerbaijan.

Turkish children are being brainwashed into Islam faster than Iran ever did. Unless some drastic changes occur that is what is waiting for Turkey. Ask a Turk *who lives in Turkey* who is in touch with what is going on in the school system. Sure at the end a synthesis of nationalism and Islamism could be put in place. But I assure you that Erdogan is not only using Islam as a rhetoric, but as a concrete policy for Turkey... and beyond. I agree with right wing policies of the others you mention including their use of religion. 

Sure, how Iran came to be Islamic in its modern form has nothing to do with what is going on in Turkey. Precisely maybe why it is even more dangerous in Turkey's case, just look at the trend with youth in Iran compared to the trend in youth in Turkey. What matters is that Erdogan is employing a policy of Islamism in the country beyond rhetorics and foreign policy realpolitik.

&gt; Turkey and Azerbaijan have similar problems, common origin, similar language, similar culture, etc. There is reason for Turkey to back Azerbaijan

Sure, but my point with the link is him saying this in the EOC (Another islamic union like the OIC). The context is religious in nature. That is Turkey using Islam to favour Azerbaijan. A bad analogy could be Armenia going to the EU Parliament (not same thing but I cannot think of a similar Christian OIC, it doesn't exist) and officially stating that EU members should support Armenia because of it being Christian. That would be an insane thing to do.

&gt; ''The Azerbaijani territory of Karabakh has been occupied for 20 years. The negotiations in order to settle the issue peacefully seem to have failed. **The ECO, as well as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)** need to intervene and make necessary arrangements so that the Armenian invasion is condemned on a world stage,''

...

&gt; ... that Azerbaijan is Armenian lands and that we are nomadic invading Mongols who need to return to the steppes of Mongolia.

I would say this has more to do with Arab-Turkish issues than with Arab-Armenian issues - again it matters which country, as some have (or had) significant Armenian population.

&gt;  Look at Turkey, bending its ass for Palestine and they get spit on.

That was the perfect time for an intervention, but nothing happened. Assad got the message, escalated more, and saw how nobody did anything even after multiple chemical attacks in 2013. And last year he saw again that he can use chemical weapons as the response will be small - the US launched some missiles against an airfield and even warned about it beforehand.

This round of strikes will be somewhat stronger probably, but it doesn't threaten Assad, nor his ability to continue the war. It won't even slow down his current operations.

323,"&gt; I don't consider the English to have a political bias in this conflict.

Not sure about that one: 

&gt; The UK is the largest foreign investor in Azerbaijan. There are around 400 British companies in Azerbaijan. BP actively participates in the field of exploration of oil and natural gas in such projects as Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli, Shah Deniz and Shah Deniz-2.

France has a lesser (if any) role in the OSCE Minsk Group. The group is helmed by US and Russia. Everything you see happening in OSCE Minsk Group is mainly spearheaded by the US closely followed by Russia. Both of them have their own self interests first and foremost with Armenia and Azerbaijan being just chess pieces for them more than anything else. Russia and the US have worked together and until today at least agree with each other on the conflict - they say this themselves, it is not an opinion. 

Re Religion, sure I totally agree that there is realpolitik involved and not religion, in most if not all cases, specially with Pakistan. But that is not the point. The point is that at the end of the day *religion* is used for political goals and that is the whole point, that it is an extremely dangerous and wrong thing to do which is what Armenia gets accused of and which such accusations have no leg to stand on, there is no Christian solidarity of any kind beyond a few extremist cases like Le Pen which didn't come to fruition as policy, unlike Pakistan. Turkey is a big unknown. For all we know tomorrow it can become fully Iran 2.0 (it is partial now) and expand its influence through Islam competing with Saudi Arabia (and Iran) and attempt to sway Azerbaijan in its direction. History repeats itself. That hasn't happened yet, but Turkey is moving towards that direction. Even though Alevis and Shiites have not been great, they are still largely there in Turkey.

https://www.dailysabah.com/diplomacy/2017/03/01/erdogan-calls-for-solidarity-with-trnc-azerbaijan-during-pakistan-trip

As for the Arab world supporting Armenia, well it's not that it is great support either, I mean I don't know of any case apart form the obvious ones where Armenians have a strong presence, but the main reason why they do this is most probably geopolitical, for Azerbaijan having sided with Turkey politically and afaik many Arab countries have rivalries with Turkey.

537,"You’re confusing *personal* racism with *systemic* racism.  I’m not talking about undocumented border crossings, I’m talking about the issues of accessibility of ID cards and paperwork for PoC.  A white man in an office job might be able to take time off work to go to the office to get their ID renewed, but a woman of color (especially trans women of color) working a service job doesn’t have that same luxury.

So to deny them healthcare or public assistance just because they missed their ID renewal appointment because their child was unfairly suspended from school (which PoC are targeted by at disparate rates) and they had to go pick them up, or the stress of living with a backdrop of white supremacist violence gave them too much anxiety to complete the forms,  it’s completely dehumanizing.

558,"&gt;But they still made the claim. The claim still happened. That was my point. The point is that company give promises full of hot air. The fact the person saying it is a PR-person gives it even more weight, because the PR-person is the one who should be able to give most accurate information concerning their project.
Why did you emphasize that he is a PR-person? Are you implying that ""they are not to be trusted""? Are you implying that nuclear energy companies might give incorrect information about their projects to make them seem more rosy?

This is a very Finnish way of thinking here. When startup companies launch they often give ridiculous press releases about changing the world and huge possibilities their business could provide. PR-person is probably the least skilled person in the company to evaluate if these claims are realistic or not. Anybody worth two shits immediately knew that 2018 was just hype and not a real target. It was dropped from Fennovoima press material by 2009 if I recall correctly.

I dont know how else Fennovoima should have handled this. Finnish way of marketing simply does not work.

It often surprises people unfamiliar with nuclear stuff that the whole process of periaatepäätöslupa is completely optional according to the current nuclear law. Parliament just has chosen to give itself the ultimate power over nuclear projects because energy is hugely political issue.
Aspiring nuclear companies can not apply for periaatepäätöslupa before politicians signal green light as failing to secure the permit might kill the project completely. It takes sufficient will from political parties to let companies invest and this takes time.

This is the fault of the government

Then force majeure happened when Germany went full anti-nuclear and E.On left. It's not reasonable to fault Fennovoima for this unforeseen event. It should be mentioned that both options for the original power plants (Toshiba and Areva) went *essentially* bankrupt over failed nuclear projects so finding the Russian partner was a very good choice.

This is nobodys fault.

This is a public forum so only thing I will say about STUK is that their [layoffs](http://www.stuk.fi/-/stukin-yt-neuvottelut-paattyivat-irtisanottavien-maara-arvioitua-pienempi) hurt really bad their ability to process the amount of documents this project requires. Every round of papers from Moscow to STUK takes forever as unlike ROSATOM, STUK can't just assign 500 more people to handle the project. 

This is essentially fault of the government for cutting the funding.

It's not really an economical disaster since we basicly get a NPP majorly funded by Russia. Politics concerning NPP are messy, but that is the fault of politicians for making it full of needless bureaucracy.

You're of course right on that point that these predictions might not come to pass but that's only if we change our policies.

I don't think that's quite feasible as everyone is ""in need"", of course everyone wants to live the most ideal life but that's not a right and I don't think that turning Germany into a dumping ground of people who had it bad will solve anything in the long term because it creates cultural divide, social friction, probably increased crime rates and certainly increased costs for funding the welfare state and you can only increase the costs for so much...

&gt;My grandmother was a refugee after WWII.

With all respect, that's a false analogy. Your grandmother is from Silesia or Pommerania correct? Territories that are today part of Poland, meaning she emigrated to a neighbouring country which is the main difference. She didn't travel to a different continent, she didn't travel through 5-6 other countries just to get to a place that gives the most optimal amount of welfare benefits and social aid.

&gt;I'm not going to turn around and refuse to help people in a similar situation now

You what you do, but let's be clear on the differences between your grandmother, who sought refugees in the first safe country (which is what refugees are supposed to do anyway) and people from the Middle East and Africa who travel thousands of kilometres to Germany, which is less about seeking the closest safe country and more about seeking the country that gives them the most material gains.

Most of them live in separate districts among themselves, creating a parallel society in the process and let's not even mention that considering that MENA migrants make only 3% of Germany's population they commit a disproportionate amount of crime.

645,"&gt; 100% european, mostly christians, white, even the muslims we'd have would be balkans people, just converted. You honestly think anybody would see that as ""multicultural"" ?

But then all of Europe put together is barely multicultural... White, Christian, European, influenced by largely the same empires and schools of thought (starting with Greek philosophy and Roman law). Hell, that same culture with ""slight"" variations got exported to Americas and Oceania, even - partially - to Africa and parts of Asia. The only ""very alien"" cultures to that would be... China? Bloody Afghanistan? But even the Middle East was very involved in the building of European culture, and same works in reverse.

My point being, if we view it that way - and we *can*, I'm not saying there's a correct way to view such matters - then there's really very little multiculturality left in the world, period.

Personally, I wouldn't go that far. Yes, the rich in Tokyo live very similar lives to the rich in London, humans almost everywhere are very, very similar, but I think that if we go that far, then we can stop talking about culture for the most part.

Though Merkel not becomming chancellor again was actually a possible option after the elections. If the SPD would have said no to a coalition and the CDU would have not established a minority government (which would have led to re-elections), then it very well could have led to the end of Merkel's chancellorship. Losing 8 % and then going into a grand coalition (which has barely 50 %) is not excactly an unquestionable mandate. 

Another point about Merkel's CDU that doesn't get noticed so much in other countries is that they are becomming are very unpopular coalition partner (which also weakened her position) because effectively Merkel sucks the life and ideas out of other parties and gets credit for everything, even if other parties initiated it, while they get all the blame (see FDP &amp; SPD).

714,"&gt; Maybe like a Switzerland, I think.

I'm assuming that you'd have a Serbo-Croatian core, and that religion would become less important and the Bosnians would turn into ""muslim Yugoslavians"". Then what's left of ethnic minorities could just have the normal minority exceptions or in extremis their own country still, but by then you'd have a stable core.

&gt;There was a degree of assimilation, yes. But given that in the period of 1918-1990 the number of Yugoslavs barely rose to double digits (?), it wasn't working properly - or at least, not the way the ideologists imagined it. The problem with nation-building in the way it happened in Italy/Germany/etc is that: a) there was no single core identity that could overpower the others (Piedmont role), and b) it came too late.

Yes, I think that was the main problem: centralization/assimilation policies like other European states used were no longer acceptable at that point in time. You see it in states that unified later, like Germany and Italy: they have much more local cultural diversity than early centralizers like France.

&gt;Even if we accept that modern nation-states weren't a thing through most of history, they did get built in the 19th century for the most part, or at least the idea of them got built (I am Croatian, he is Serbian, that other fellow is Slovenian), statehood/borders came later. And, in this area the idea got built in terms of resistance to assimilation by Austrians/Hungarians/Turks. So, yet another attempt at assimilation was greeted with hostility.
So, Switzerland. They did it differently when compared to most other Europeans, and maybe their model could have worked for us.

If I may pitch the Belgian model: that's a little more flexible because you have both the Regions and Communities. Given the mixed habitation patterns of different ethnicities (unlike Switzerland which is basically an assembly of distinct valleys), that would be more suitable IMO.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/8brioa/eastern_and_central_europe_most_countries_lack/dxayui2/,silverionmox,1523633680

Other substratum words can be found in modern Sardinian toponomastic.

Europe's dependency on Russian gas. It's a ""take it or leave it"" type of deal because of this dependency. It's a monopoly held by a country which is not an EU member.

Russia gets to dictate whatever prices it wants because we currently have no other alternatives.

The same goes for the freedom of travel deal with the US. The EU gets visa free travel to the US with the exception of a few countries. Turning down the entire deal would be detrimental to the whole EU. Meanwhile, the EU keeps trying to get the deal to include all EU countries but the US gets to dictate the terms because the US holds a monopoly on entering the US.

""By 2050"" lol!

Newsflash: Sweden had to increase the retirement age to cope with the skyrocketing costs. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Germany's ""robust"" economy is manufactured for a short term boost. You can make a lot of dough by increasing cheap, state sponsered consumption and maxing out on a equally cheap workforce (which will be increasingly irrelevant with increased automation). But this is not sustainable for even the next decade. For that, you need well educated, culturally homogenous peoples. France's national IQ just plummeted! How will they fare in terms of MINT graduates, I wonder? 

Theres plenty of other factors you don't want to grasp. For instance that up to now, Canada and Australia had a lot of high IQ foreign influx, essentially the reverse of a brain drain (which in itself is morally wrong!). This looks nice on paper, as you clearly reduce education costs if you can simply import PHDs. But it still atomizes society and sows the seeds for a huge identitarian crisis. Not to mention that even high IQ foreigners share a completely different outlook on culture and policy, resulting in an abundance of opportunity costs for everybody. So Australia is a laughable example for Europe.

Now Europe did not even enjoy the luxury of tight immigration laws. Germany got low IQ peoples, and 85%+ are from hostile cultures. I remember a plethora of jubilant articles, all assuring( !) that the ""new Europeans"" would be well-educated and eager to work. It is official now that the majority are analphabetes. 80% won't pass even rudimentary language tests (""My name is x, I want to buy this y""). But don't worry, Australia and Canada will, in a few years, catch up in terms of inclusiveness.

Can any of you ""doom &amp; gloom"" guys show how our cultures are collapsing and it's the fault of immigration?

I'm seeing the countryside abandoned, but that's because the modern economy no longer supports living in tiny villages in the middle of nowhere.

I'm seeing regional languages dying out, but that's (again) because the modern economy no longer supports speaking a language that is only fully understood in a 50 Km radius around your town.

I'm seeing small local shops close, but that's because it's cheaper and easier to do your shopping in supermarkets and the little guy just can't keep up.

I'm seeing people move away from religion, but that's because nobody wants to bother with its many obligations, and because religion doesn't really seem to offer many answers anymore.

I'm seeing people express themselves in ways that would have once been socially stigmatized, but that's because those people fought for the right to be themselves openly.

What of this is the fault of immigrants? there's a mosque near my house, is that why fewer and fewer people attend the local church every year? we have Chinese and Indian restaurants, is that why fewer people know how to make traditional Italian food from scratch? North African immigrants are listening to Arabic songs, is that why we listen to so much foreign, mostly American, music?

The reason is that Germany, as well as other 'Northern' countries, want to see reforms first, otherwise Eurobonds or an EMF will just be a wealth transaction from them to the 'Southern' countries, without fundamentally reforming/improving the economy/country. This would mean adding a lasting burden for the 'Northern' countries. Mind, the EU already does a lot to help poorer regions. 

What Macon wants will probably take longer than he would like. To have countries properly integrate more into a well functioning Eurozone, more reforms are necessary, which will take some time. 

At least Macon has given a vision for the future of the Eurozone. This has spurred other countries to think about the future as well, which was necessary.

It seems to me like a win - win. You ensure that the children of migrants are skilled and employable on par with a citizen to promote a stable economic situation at home by ensuring there is a least one provider, you can teach local cultural values within the education system, traditions and heritage not to be passed on but at least to familiarize children who don't get that contact or knowledge from home (coming from an atheist family, a big part of what I know about Christianity came from my religious education classes in school, I imagine it's the same if you're from a Muslim or Hindu family), so that there is at least an understanding of **why** certain festivals are important etc..

It would also help if schools were a bit more equipped to deal with children who are raised in a very different environment/cultures at home than in the school, we **need** them to be the ambassadors of our culture when they go home, to encourage their parents to learn, step in and take part.

I know it's expensive and unpopular right now, but funding for education would benefit all children, but it would benefit some much more than others with a mostly equal investment on the taxpayers part.

The 'problematic' issue with the first is that it will require large parts of the centre-left/left to come to terms with 

a) one culture can be preferred over another,

b) (Sunni) Islam must either be europeanised or actively faught with education/social policies.

The centre-right/right will have to come to terms with the idea that people of different ethnicity than what Europe had previously can be fully European. Mind you, this can be perfectly in line with traditionalist outlooks elsewhere.

If the above does not occur, the moment a serious political and economic crisis hit at the same time somebody will abuse the divides present in society and engage in the age-old European sport of religious prosecution and ethnic cleansing. 

Edit: what gives me hope is that my state (NRW) - the most populous in Germany, with the most Muslims - is experimenting with b). These are early days, but Germany has an advantage France or Britain do not have: mandatory religious education in schools. We are beginning to release state-educated Islam teachers on the next generation, taught by Islam Theologists who are synthesising mainstream Islam and humanist values.

Besides there are also countless examples of native populations being exterminated or displaced by newcomers.

Nonsense. Legislators were discussing sanctioning countries that do not produce passports within a reasonable amount of time. The same goes for not taking people back. Letting them stay as long as the legal process of deportation isn't completed is according to international law and treaties.

&gt; people go lenient on people who break the law.

That isn't even remotely true. Criminals are detained and often deported. But even that has to be done in due process. You can't just brake laws and treaties by dumping people in another country. This is how some people want it to work, but the world is a bit more complicated than that.

&gt; How about this, claim refugee status in the first safe country you enter or you are not allowed elsewhere.

You're aware that states in the EU help each other by taking in refugees that landed elsewhere, right? Those people then have the right to claim asylum in that new host country.

""Mevlut Cavusoglu ... writing an article for Foreign Policy to take credit for the group’s demise, insisting that Turkey’s actions in northern Syria have helped lay the groundwork for a sustainable peace.""

Those actions (in Turkish operations ""Euphrates Shield"" and ""Olive branch"") actually **slowed** the real fight against ISIS since the Kurdish YPG was already steamrolling ISIS at a steady pace. 

Before the start of operation ""Euphrates Shield"" Turkey just stood by and watched while its Turkish armed, supplied, trained and funded Jihadi mercenaries inside Syria were getting their asses handed to them to the point where only one city (Azaz) was still held by those jihadi mercenaries.

Only when the risk of the Kurdish militias linking up their eastern Cantons with the Afrin Canton in the west became substantial, did Turkey finally and forcefully invade Syria. By that time, ISIS had ceased to be a conventional threat to the Turkish border. Also, Kurdish YPG units then had to be used to defend against Turkish lead Jihadis taking their recently captured from ISIS territory instead of continuing the fight against ISIS.

Talking about double standards:""The Olive Branch operation is not only about protecting Turkey from terrorism.""

Actually, Turkey was the party shelling, bombarding and repeatedly (ineffectively) attacking Afrin with its Jihadi mercenaries on dozens of occasions over the years, while the Afrin Kurdish YPG showed remarkable restraint in ***not*** retalliating to those Turkish provocations. On top of that, I have yet to see ***any*** evidence proving that the Afrin YPG had anything to do with any kind of so called ""terrorist attack"" in Turkey. 

The invasion of Afrin, the only region of Syria that was still unspoilt by war, has caused lots of deaths and destruction, causing well over 150,000 people to flee the jihadi invaders, who immediately started to loot everything and who have been treating the locals very badly. Reports of people being kicked out of their house, tortured and even killed, women being forced out of all local administrations and Yazidi women being forced to wear the headscarf and the jihadis acting as badly as they did in the Euplrates shield area abound.

Add the Turkish organised influx of non Kurdish Syrian refugees in another attempt to change the ethnic make up of Afrin and the term ethnic cleansing seems fitting here.

Stating that the Olive Branch operation is ""not only"" about protecting Turkey from terrorism is therefore nothing short of hypocricy.

The OCR letter asserted that universities must use a “preponderance of the evidence” standard to evaluate guilt, meaning the accused must be disciplined if a fact-finder is 51 percent certain he is guilty. The letter also stated that schools should allow a student to appeal if her alleged abuser is found not guilty. Moreover, OCR discouraged schools from allowing the accused to cross-examine accusers because this experience “may be traumatic or intimidating” to the alleged victim.

1314,"&gt;why didn't he just accept concessions and allow democracy? 

Why do you automatically presume that that *must* have been what the majority of people wanted? People don't automatically want democracy just because you want it. Look at the Spanish civil war as another example.

The Baath and their supporters are fully willing to destroy their own civilization if it means that groups like the Muslim Brotherhood *never* have a chance to publicly assemble &amp; obtain power. Many, many Syrians support them in this. Of course, many don't, but it's foolish to suggest that the Baath don't have a significant amount of popular support. 

And with regards to your original comment, you must understand that this war has been going on for quite a long time. 2011 was 7 years ago, and things have drastically changed. The urbanized protesters &amp; original army defectors were completely sidelined by rural &amp; suburban revolutionaries circa 2013. 

7 years on, the entirety of the opposition is comprised of Islamists. However many civilian protesters who got shot should not be what you think about when you question why someone would support Assad. The values those protesters died for are not the values that *the largest rebel organizations in the country fight for*, plain and simple. 

Anyway, I must ask, why is democracy the end goal &amp; good result in your opinion? To me it's incredibly naive and optimistic, and reminds me of people who thought that Communism in China or Russia was a good idea, as opposed to actually developed nations. 

Would you still support democracy in a country like Syria, knowing it's fully possible that Islamist organizations are very likely to achieve a popular mandate? Do you realize the scale of suffering that could inflict on the minorities? Secularism and western progress are only achieved at gunpoint, by the hands of a well armed secularist vanguard.

The neighborhood that got gassed was the last chunk of East Ghouta to be captured. The entirety of the rebel area minus the gassed section was captured in an extremely quick campaign that started in Feburary.

FaR &amp; JAI were considered to be some of the strongest &amp; well equipped factions in the war, &amp; it was once thought that East Ghouta was a ferocious stronghold that would never fall.

Look at JAI's famous military parade (i'd link but I can only find Liveleak mirrors), they were one of the only groups that could claim to be a real army.

[Here is a map of the situation, the two areas circled were the first to be captured at the beginning of the campaign.](https://southfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/15feb_eastern_ghouta_Syria_War_Map.jpg_)  Previously, these front lines have remained mostly unchanged for years, and East Ghouta remained probably one of the deadliest fronts to be assigned to, as it claimed the lives of thousands of Syrian soldiers.

And the entire thing minus Douma (which is surrendering now) was taken in a month long campaign that consisted of more routing than actual fighting. Kilometers of expertly crafted trenches entrenchments, earthwork defenses, underground tunnels, fell in days.

This was a Syrian Army operation, mind you. Tens of thousands of Syrian soldiers of every religion.

So what is this again about the ""your people hating your guts"" comment? Do you seriously think that real life is that black and white? SOHR reports on rebel casualties are usually in the 60-40% local-foreigner btw. Government numbers have a much higher percentage of Syrian deaths. Before this campaign, hundreds of FAR, JAI, and HTS men died fighting each other, and Idlib has been having a mini-civil war for several months now, between AAS + FSA vs HTS. Are these who you think have the mandate of the Syrians?

The severity of response attached and brought forth by the OP is ridiculous, especially so given his attitude towards the atrocities committed during the multiple genocides during 1915.

&gt; Starting in 1942, the port city of Pahlevi (now known as Anzali) became the main landing point for Polish refugees coming into Iran from the Soviet Union, receiving up to 2,500 refugees per day. General Anders evacuated 74,000 Polish troops, including approximately 41,000 civilians, many of them children, to Iran. In total, over 116,000 refugees were relocated to Iran. Approximately 5,000–6,000 of the Polish refugees were Jewish.

&gt;Erdogan wants Turks to do politics abroad
&gt;
&gt;T he Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has urged Turkish citizens in EU countries to increase their political influence. ""Take personal responsibilities in political parties and political mechanisms,"" Erdogan said on Tuesday in an appeal to ""my citizens in Europe."" Erdogan reminded members of his AKP in Ankara that a year ago more than 60 percent of Turks in Germany had voted in favor of the presidential system he was aiming for at the constitutional referendum. ""That means there is power there. This power must also be effective in local politics. ""
&gt;
&gt;The goal must be to suppress the influence of organizations such as the banned Kurdish Workers' Party PKK or the left-wing extremist DHKP-C in Europe. ""Do not leave the politics there to the PKK. Do not leave the politics there to the DHKP-C, ""Erdogan told ACP members. ""If our citizens, loyal to their country, their people, their flag and their call to prayer, stick together, they have the opportunity to be ten times, a hundred times more influential in the political parties and politicians than they are.""'
&gt;
&gt;""Your country is yours""
&gt;
&gt;Erdogan urged Turkish citizens to learn the language of the country in which they lived and to know the local social environment. At the same time he appealed to her: ""Never make concessions to your mother tongue, your faith and solidarity with each other."" He added, ""Your country is yours.""
&gt;
&gt;Erdogan complained that EU countries neglected to deal with supporters of the PKK. In this context, he criticized the police in Stuttgart for their dealings with a Turkish-born citizen who had protested against a demonstration by Kurds. ""Why are the German authorities and their police tormenting an honest Turkish citizen who opposes this terrorist organization while blandly dealing with the terrorist organization?""
&gt;
&gt;With the terrorist organization the PKK is meant. The case in Stuttgart has been discussed by the Turkish government since Monday. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said on Monday, referring to the Turkic-born victim, ""kiss the eyes of our brother who called Erdogan to death"". That's exactly Heimatliebe and that's exactly what fatherland love is. "" Erdogan and Yildirim had phoned the person concerned.
&gt;
&gt;A spokesman for the Stuttgart police had said in view of the allegations on Monday, on the sidelines of a demonstration of 30 Kurds had come on Saturday to insults and fisticuffs. A 39-year-old German of Turkish descent was identified as a provocateur and detained by the police to determine the personal details. Since he had resisted, he had been ""laid to the ground"".

1378,"&gt;Thousands of Croat conservatives protested on Saturday against the proposed ratification of a European treaty that describes gender as a **“social role”**, fearing it could undermine traditional family values in the predominantly Catholic country.

Croats are simply protesting against post modern (marxist) social constructivism that is stating that gender is just a ""construct"" rather than biological fact.

&gt;**While supporting the protection of women**, opponents object to the treaty’s definition of gender, which they say paves way for introducing transsexual or transgender as separate categories, which they oppose.

https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/03/how-skyscrapers-can-save-the-city/308387/

&gt;The cheapest way to deliver new housing is in the form of mass-produced two-story homes, which typically cost only about $84 a square foot to erect. That low cost explains why Atlanta and Dallas and Houston are able to supply so much new housing at low prices, and why so many Americans have ended up buying affordable homes in those places.
&gt;
&gt;Building up is more costly, especially when elevators start getting involved. And erecting a skyscraper in New York City involves additional costs (site preparation, legal fees, a fancy architect) that can push the price even higher. But many of these are fixed costs that don’t increase with the height of the building. In fact, once you’ve reached the seventh floor or so, building up has its own economic logic, since those fixed costs can be spread over more apartments. Just as the cost of a big factory can be covered by a sufficiently large production run, the cost of site preparation and a hotshot architect can be covered by building up. The actual marginal cost of adding an extra square foot of living space at the top of a skyscraper in New York is typically less than $400. Prices do rise substantially in ultra-tall buildings—say, over 50 stories—but for ordinary skyscrapers, it doesn’t cost more than $500,000 to put up a nice 1,200-square-foot apartment. The land costs something, but in a 40-story building with one 1,200-square-foot unit per floor, each unit is using only 30 square feet of Manhattan—less than a thousandth of an acre. At those heights, the land costs become pretty small. If there were no restrictions on new construction, then prices would eventually come down to somewhere near construction costs, about $500,000 for a new apartment. That’s a lot more than the $210,000 that it costs to put up a 2,500-square-foot house in Houston—but a lot less than the $1 million or more that such an apartment often costs in Manhattan.

Dutch doesn't have it as in the clinical term there is only ""man"" and ""woman"" except that ""man"" is not also the name of the species so there's that but I prefer clinical terms at the end of the day and they mean a different thing.

I remember reading some stupid lifestyle blog which opened with something like. ""You were born a male but that doesn't make you a man yet."" with some stupid tips on how to become ""a man"" but it does capture the difference in English between ""male"" and ""man"" and there's nothing quite like that in Dutch sadly.

Also note that in Dutch ""first man in space"" would always be translated as ""eerste mens in de ruimte"" which unambiguously means ""human"" because if you say ""eerste man in de ruimte"" in Dutch it essentially implies that there were human females in space before that point similar to what ""first woman in space"" in English implies but even the term ""mens"" in Dutch for ""human"" isn't clinical like the term ""human"" is.",Je kon de macht der goden hebben!,/r/europe/comments/8bpghv/today_is_the_57th_anniversary_of_yuri_gagarins/dxa0dne/,Kringspier_Des_Heren,1523584334

1440,"&gt;You can openly read pretty much racist expressions and it's somehow ok if it's against Turks or Russians

This *technically* belongs in /r/EuropeMeta but since I just responded to a [similar situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8apdjk/on_yesterdays_events_shitholes_and_qa/dx16lfz/?context=2) in another thread I'll try to repeat the same sentiment here.

In my personal opinion bias exists against Russians and Turks both in the subreddit as a whole and within our moderation. *However* that bias on the moderation level is not because we somehow dislike or even hate Turks or Russians.

The classic racist expressions (and all rule violations for that matter) are much more likely to be reported if the user in question has a flair that the majority of our userbase 'dislike' at whatever point in time (or if he doesn't have a flair and 'sounds' like he's from that nation anyway) and the team as a whole is a bit too removed from those areas in my opinion to catch some of the more subtle attacks.

Russians and Turks are a pretty clear winner on this list (mostly due to people conflating the average user with their governments) but similar things happen in most threads.

Due to time constraints we can't always look into all reports in-depth (we'll add a new round of mods because of this soon(tm)), then it can look like we're taking a side and in return users from Russia and Turkey report even less and it all spirals from there.

1) First of all you're assuming that defending identity means shutting yourself off from anything else, which is stupid and not very feasible. If you're listening to german rock music you're already ""tainting"" your cultural identity with a cultural form that wasn't part of your culture before. That doesn't mean that by listening to rock you're giving up your identity.

2) You're assuming people will keep islam en masse. This is the usual poor logic ""THEY all follow a deterministic life as if they were brainless robots, US choose individually our destiny"". 

3) You're assuming that different cultures canno't cohexist by any chance. In fact, in 5000 years of recorded human civilization, we do not known any meaninful society that was monocultural or ""monotribal"", yet here we are. 2nd century Rome had close to 1 millions people, most of them outsiders from an empire that stretched from far west from far east. Didn't stop the empire from shining. Hundreds of spoken tongues, hundreds if not thousands religious cults, dozens different skin colours. Tensions are inevitable in every society (if not black vs white, poor vs rich, commies vs nazis) but multicultural life has been the norm, not the modern exception. A good policy goes a long way to avoid infighting of any sort. A us vs them does the opposite. But I'm thinking a certain part of the population is actively wishing for infighting to happen, so they can come out and act like prophets. ""guyse I tould you so them muslims would rebel"", yeah, because you keep telling them everyday how different and inherently evil they are. 2nd class citizens.

4) You're showing a poor understanding of modern democracies. Certain rights are protected regardless what people vote. 

Last, could you please educate me what german culture entails? Is there only 1 german culture? Does every german behave the same? Think the same? Are they all lutherans listening to Bach at church in Sunday? Do they all vote one political party? Do they all believe in the same human and political rights? Do you have to eat pork sausages and drink beer to be german? Then what about vegetarians?

All the people defending ""my culture!"" (on reddit, because usually these people largely ignore any cultural achievement of their own countries) never manage to give a ever-working definition of their culture.

There was a time when Breton, Alsacien, Flemish, Corse, Tahitian, kanak languages were far more useful to speakers than French. French made itself useful becayse French speakers imposed their structures on them. That is why Tahitian is losing speakers in Tahiti, when for all the millenia before, it had no need of French and is thousands of KMs away from mainland France. How is it that the Kanak languages are dying? 

 You don't need to massacre people, true, to kill their language. You just need to turn their world upside down. you need to take away the whole economical basis (you mention centralisation) for living by themselves, you make economic and professional success dependant on learning the language, you conscript people into armies, you undercut the previous leadership or even better you co-opt them to be your agents (some of the most fervent Republican jacobinists were from the provinces) etc. ",Australia,/r/europe/comments/8bsy7j/language_and_dialect_groups_of_italy/dxa36lj/,paniniconqueso,1523587338

My wording might sound condescending or abusive but it's really not meant it that way.

This is just a simple and plain fact. In 2028 Islam will play more of a role in German culture and politics than it currently does.

&gt;Since its adoption and entry into force in January 2012, the Constitution of Hungary (the “Fundamental Law”) has been amended six times. The Venice Commission expressed its concern regarding the constitution - making process in Hungary on several occasions, both as  regards  the  the  Fundamental  Law  and  amendments  thereto.  The  criticism  focused  on the  lack  of  transparency  of  the  process,  the  inadequate  involvement  of  civil  society,  the absence  of  sincere  consultation,  the  endangerment  of  the  separation  of  powers and  the weakening of the national system of checks and balances.

-

&gt;In  its  statement  adopted  on  9  April  2018,  the  limited  election  observation  mission  of  the OSCE  Office  for  Democratic  Institutions  and  Human  Rights  concluded  that  the  2018 parliamentary  elections  were  characterised  by  a  pervasive  overlap  between  state  and ruling party resources, undermining the ability of candidates to compete on an equal basis. Voters  had  a  wide  range  of  political  options  but  intimidating  and  xenophobic  rhetoric, media  bias  and  opaque  campaign  financing  constricted  the  space  for  genuine political debate,  hindering  the  ability  of  voters  to  make  a  fully  informed  choice. 

-

&gt;The competences of the  Hungarian Constitutional Court were restricted as a result of the constitutional reform, including with regard to budgetary matters, the abolition of the actio popularis, the possibility for the Court to refer to its case law prior to 1 January 2012 and the  limitation  on  the  Court’s  ability  to  review  the  constitutionality  of  any  changes  to  the Fundamental Law apart from those of a procedural nature only. The Venice Commission expressed  serious  concerns  about  those  limitations  and  about  the procedure  for  the appointment of judges, and made recommendations to the Hungarian authorities to ensure the necessary checks and balances in its Opinion on Act CLI of 2011 on the Constitutional Court of Hungary adopted on 19 June 2012 and in its Opinion on the Fourth Amendment to the Fundamental Law of Hungary adopted on 17 June 2013.

-

&gt;In  the  concluding  observations  of  5  April  2018,  the  UN  Human  Rights  Committee expressed  concerns  that  Hungary’s  legal  framework  on  secret  surveillance  for  national security   purposes   allows   for   mass   interception   of   communications   and   contains insufficient safeguards against arbitrary interference with the right to privacy. It was also concerned  at  the  lack  of  provisions  to  ensure  effective  remedies  in  cases  of  abuse,  and notification to the person concerned as soon as possible, without endangering the purpose of the restriction, after the termination of the surveillance measure.

-

&gt;In its Opinion of 22 June 2015 on Media Legislation, the Venice Commission insisted on  the  need  to change  the  rules  governing  the  election  of  the  members  of  the  Media Council to ensure fair representation of socially significant political and other groups and that the method of appointment and the position of the Chairperson of the Media Council or  the  President  of  the  Media  Authority  should  be  revisited  in  order  to  reduce  the concentration of powers and secure political neutrality; the Board of Trustees should also be   reformed   along   those   lines.   The   Venice   Commission   also   recommended   the decentralisation of the governance of public service media providers and that the National News  Agency  not  be  the  exclusive  provider  of  news  for  public  service  media providers.

-

&gt;On  7  December  2017,  the  Commission  decided  to  start  legal  proceedings  against Hungary  for  failing  to  fulfil  its  obligations  under  the  Treaty  provisions  on  the  free movement of capital, due to provisions in the NGO Law which indirectly discriminate and disproportionately   restrict   donations   from   abroad   to   civil   society   organisations.   In addition,  the  Commission  concluded  that  Hungary  had violated  the  right  to freedom  of association and the  rights  to  protection  of  private  life  and  personal  data enshrined  in  the Charter, read in conjunction with the Treaty provisions on the free movement of capital.

-

&gt;In  its  concluding  observations  of  5  April 2018,  the  UN  Human  Rights  Committee expressed  concerns  that  the  constitutional  ban  on  discrimination  does  not  explicitly  list sexual  orientation  and  gender  identity  among  the  grounds  of  discrimination  and  that  its restrictive definition of family could  give rise to discrimination as it does not encompass certain  types  of  family  arrangements,  including  same - sex  couples.  The  Committee  was also  concerned  about  acts  of  violence  and  the  prevalence  of  negative  stereotypes  and prejudice  against  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual  and  transgender  persons,  particularly  in  the employment  and  education  sectors.  It  also  mentioned  forced  placement  in  medical institutions, isolation and  forced  treatment  of  large numbers  of  persons  with  mental, intellectual and psychosocial disabilities, as well as reported violence and cruel, inhuman and  degrading  treatment  and  allegations  of  a  high  number  of  non-investigated  deaths  in closed institutions.

-

&gt;In  its  concluding  observations  of  5  April  2018,  the  UN Human  Rights  Committee expressed regret that patriarchal stereotyped attitudes still prevail in Hungary with respect to  the  position  of  women  in  society,  and  noted  with  concern  discriminatory  comments made by political figures against women. It also noted that the Hungarian Criminal Code does not fully protect female victims of domestic violence.

-

&gt;In  its  Fourth  Opinion  on  Hungary  adopted  on  25  February  2016,  the  Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities noted that  Roma  continue  to  suffer  systemic  discrimination  and  inequality  in  all  fields  of  life, including housing, employment, education, access to health and participation in social and political life. 

-

&gt;It  noted  with  concern  the  push-back  law,  which  was  first  introduced  in  June  2016, enabling  summary  expulsion  by  the  police  of  anyone  who  crosses  the  border  irregularly and  was  detained  on  Hungarian  territory  within  8  kilometres  of  the  border,  which  was subsequently extended to the entire territory of Hungary, and decree 191/2015 designating Serbia as a “safe third country” allowing for push-backs at Hungary’s border with Serbia. The   Committee   noted   with   concern   reports   that   push-backs   have   been   applied indiscriminately   and   that   individuals   subjected   to   this   measure   have   very   limited opport unity to submit an asylum application or right to appeal. It also noted with concern reports  of  collective  and  violent  expulsions,  including  allegations  of  heavy  beatings, attacks by police dogs and shootings with rubber bullets, resulting in severe injuries and, at  least  in  one  case,  in  the  loss  of  life  of  an  asylum  seeker.

I think it’s funny how you completely ignore the Soviet invasion and the first name that you come up with is the US aid to the mujahideen. 

Most of the terrorists that emerged afterwards like bin laden were foreign fighters that did fight in Afghanistan against the Soviet a but did not receive any US aid. The CIA made it a policy and instructed the Pakistanis to not aid the foreign fighters. There were also CIA agents inside Afghanistan making sure that the money and arms didn’t end up at the hands of the foreign extremists.

930-770 BC (and beyond). ""The presence of various Nuraghic objects in Villanovan contexts could now take on a definitive meaning, in particular it suggests a connection by sea which, in the context of a complex commercial network, connected protourban centers devolved to the exploitation of mineral resources (the Metallie Hills and 'island of Elba), as Vetulonia and Populonia, to a multiplicity of Nuragic communities.The Nuragics, starting from the recent / final bronze age, were engaged in intense maritime activities, increasingly recognized in recent studies (it is not necessary to refer to the Phoenician mediation for the import of nuragic objects in Italy.)

All these maps are such bullshit. I was hiking in Italian alps last year and nobody spoke any dialect.

In the parts that are supposedly Occitan and Francoprovincale nobosdy understood me when I tried in French. 

Before that I met a couple of young Sicilians and none of them knew dialect. 

Yeah well they 'spoke' it like I 'speak' my dialect. That is to say, I know a couple of phrases from my Grandparents and I can  imitate the accent.

1768,"Hm. Victoria 2 is imho the best grand strategy and paradox game out there. It does have a horrible and confusing UI, It's basically excel with a few maps attached, and It has some serious flaws, but God Damn It has an awesome population system and It does try to somewhat simulate a global economy(It's pretty broken tho).

It is set in 1836-1936, does a good enough job with wars and politics, and really damn satisfying to just observe your country doing It's thing. I have some AARs I can show you: [1](https://imgur.com/a/jy37T) [2](https://imgur.com/a/gEMvF) [3](https://imgur.com/a/aLXf4)

From other paradox games, well, CKII is easily one of the best, more of an RPG-Grand Strategy mix. 

EU4 is probably the most beginner friendly, but has a pretty damn bad DLC policy. It can be quite addictive though.

Stellaris is pretty good as far as I have heard, but I haven't played it.

HOI4 is a more casual game, has pretty underwhelming DLCs, but there is a mod called Kaiserreich which is pretty grand.


From your wallet's pov, You can get Victoria and It's two *mandatory* DLCs for around 7-8 euros during a sale(There's a Victoria Collection containing all DLCs and Vic 1 and 2), for the other games you have to pay some big bucks. Stellaris has a few nice DLCs I believe and the base game ain't too shabby, EU4 has a few mandatory DLCs as well, HOI4 has a few DLCs out, but so far most of them is pretty underwhelming, and with CKII having a pretty good selection of DLCs with basically none of them necessary to enjoy the game fully It""s also a good starting point.(The base game was free to get for a few days last weekend) ",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/8bqnxu/major_trading_partner_in_europe_surrounding_areas/dx9dkku/,Isuckatnicknames,1523562174

1772,"&gt;  They are dictators because they were elected by stupid people first and foremost and then they could seize more power because of the same people being happy about whom they have elected.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So no - democracy at its worst is not better than autocracy because it can easily change into one.

So? You're telling me democracy is worse than dictatorships because it might lead to a dictatorship, which is worse? What kind of logic is that? Obviously it's worse to have had the bad option all the time then to have had it only part of the time. 

It's better to have had democratic Erdogan and Putin even briefly than to have had them being dictators from their first days. And if the people had guarded their  democracy better Erdogan and Putin would be a lot more manageable today. If they could even get reelected that is, without help from propaganda, censorship and jailing the opposition.

&gt;And if anything autocracy can be bad or good depending on authority that has the power.  But democracy that allows one government to go into autocracy is always bad.    

   

Autocracies being good is a very questionable statement. Corruption is a very human trait and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Just because you have a competent dictator doesn't mean he'll be good for the country. He's primary interest would be himself, not the people.  Democracy is much better at forcing the leader to work for the people.
  

And lol democracy is always bad when it leads to dictatorships, but dictatorships are sometimes good? But that would make democracy sometimes good too according to your logic.

As I said, some variability in the product is allowed by the brand. What I'm trying to understand is where the problem is.

&gt; IMO it's clearly a deception.

It is.  But who is the deceiver?  Are producers skimping out? Should brands tighten rules? Are product rules different for different regions?

&gt; OTOH in EE the market has very few players (local producers mostly export) and so they get away with doing this...

As with Malta, I suspect the problem is complex and related to market dynamics.  Some companies were state monopolies in the 80s and 90s, and got away with crappy products.  As competition intensified, some collapsed and some just survived and kept similar practices (perhaps improving slightly).  If they didn't have any need to improve, they didn't and since they produced a popular product, they didn't get much competition.

1879,"&gt; As I recall, Ukraine pulled gas after she had had gas cut off.

Source for that please. As fas as I know Ukrainie's Naftogaz has a take-or-pay clause with Russia's Gazprom. They bought cheaper Russian gas via Germany/France and refused to take the agreed amount. That's when it all started. Naftogaz could have easily gone to the arbitration court in Stockholm which favors anyone but Russia really. Just look at their record. Ukraine decided to cut everyone else off instead.

&gt; My understaning is that Poland makes next to nothing on it. Ukraine is very poor — is squeezing her economy for cash right now, at a politically-vulnerable time and under serious economic pressure, in German interest? I don't see how. It's, what, a couple billion a year? German is a wealthy country that exerts soft power. She buys influence, doesn't sell it. If $2 billion/year is what Germany's political interest in eastern Europe is worth, how about giving the EU right of first refusal on coming up with the funds? Or the US — I suspect that if we have to do so, we can scrape together $2 billion/year from our foreign aid budget. But if that happens, understand that Germany will be selling her political clout in part of the continent, which I think is just inane. $2 billion isn't spare change, but it's nothing like the funds being put into ensuring a contiguous Europe.

Poland wants to make more via LNG which fails right now since they don't have contracts with anyone but Qatar for two tankers a month. LNG goes exclusively to Asia at the moment because the prices there are higher. Their only chance to make LNG viable is when all European countries decide to go for that route and preasure producers into better price conditions. Ukraine is the country that gets the most macro financial assitance of any non-EU country (who pays that really? think about it). Germany's interest is a reliable gas supply only not cash. No country to the east can and wants to provide that so NS2 needs to be build.

&gt; The EU under Barroso pushed for Ukraine to work with the EU, to deal with her exclusively. To turn her back after Ukraine acts to work with her is to sorely undermine future EU efforts — if the EU cannot be relied upon by a partner in something as essential and core as this, then where will she maintain credibility?

&gt; I can see gains for Russia in Nord Stream 2. But I see no gain for Germany, and no gain for the EU.

That's just an emotional statement and it is also wrong. Ukraine still gets transit fees, a huge amount of cash (google MFA) and cheap (Russian) gas via Germany and France. The gain for all European countries is a reliable and secure gas transit.

1886,"&gt;SINCE the fall of the Berlin Wall the Ampelmännchen, the jaunty, behatted “little traffic-light man” of communist East Germany, has escaped his dictatorial roots to become a kooky icon of Germany’s trendy capital. Tourists pose with life-size models and snap up memorabilia in souvenir shops. The Ampelmännchen’s quirky coolness is an increasingly apt symbol of the country as well as its capital. As our special report in this issue describes, Germany is entering a new era. It is becoming more diverse, open, informal and hip.

&gt;At first blush that seems a preposterous suggestion. The Germany of international newspaper headlines is a country with anxious citizens and stagnant politics. Angela Merkel is Europe’s longest-standing political leader, a woman who epitomises traditional German caution. Last September’s election saw a surge in support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD); it took Mrs Merkel six months to cobble together a lacklustre new coalition. To conservative foreign observers Germany is a byword for a reckless refugee policy; to others it is the country that bullied indebted southern Europeans.

&gt;But take the long view, and the Ampelmännchen captures how Germany is changing. Post-war German history has moved in cycles of about 25 years. First came the era of reconstruction. Then, from the late 1960s, the federal republic began to reckon frankly with its war guilt. In its latest phase, from the 1990s, Germany has reunified, become a normal country again and shed some of the fetters of its past. Now the wheels of history are turning once more. The Merkel era is drawing to a close. Many of the country’s defining traits—its ethnic and cultural homogeneity, conformist and conservative society, and unwillingness to punch its weight in international diplomacy—are suddenly in flux.

&gt;The biggest change comes from Mrs Merkel’s “open door” policy towards refugees, which brought in 1.2m new migrants in 2015-16. This has confirmed once-homogeneous Germany’s transformation into a melting-pot. A more inclusive identity is emerging—a country that waited until 2000 to extend citizenship to many of those without native ancestors increasingly defines nationality in civic rather than ethnic terms. A patriarchal culture has become more gender-balanced: the share of working-age women with jobs has risen from 58% to 70% in the past 15 years. Germans are divorcing more and marrying less. Even the Mittelstand’s firms are adopting disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence. And having undertaken no foreign military operations in the half-century to 1999, Germany has sent troops to Mali, Afghanistan and Lithuania.

&gt;This is shaking up a society that has long prized stability, opening cultural divides between those who embrace the new Germany and those who hanker for the familiar; between urban and rural voters; between young and old. The emergence of a new generation of more combative lawmakers, the AfD’s arrival in the Bundestag and the battle over the future direction of Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democrats are all stoking debates about the country’s identity.

&gt;The outcome will determine the future of Europe’s biggest economy. It will also matter beyond Germany’s borders. The country is grappling with the rise of a more plural society at the same time as many others are doing so. Germans are temperamentally moderate and, thanks to their history, particularly sensitive to the dangers of demagoguery. How they navigate their country’s transition could set an example for others.

&gt;At home, the new Germany has shed its post-reunification economic woes and is booming, but it is also ageing fast; the largest age group is the 50-to-54s. Preserving its prosperity requires forward-looking reform. Internet access is patchy and slow; roads and classrooms can be surprisingly shabby; a tangle of red tape restricts service industries; and under Mrs Merkel the retirement age has fallen for some and will soon be lower than in France. The flow of newcomers to Germany can help cushion the demographic crunch, especially if immigration procedures are streamlined, education is improved to break the tight link between background and results, and the strictly regulated German professions are made more accessible.

&gt;Abroad, the new Germany could also become a different sort of power. It remains frustratingly prone to a small-country outlook: reluctant to spend enough on defence, to confront the imbalances caused by its trade surplus and to accept more burden-sharing in the euro zone. Yet there are signs of movement. Under pressure from France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, it will reluctantly accept some moves towards euro-zone integration, albeit tentative and insufficient ones. Germany’s vulnerability to trade disruption makes it a natural broker in an age of tariff wars. Last month its new economy minister helped to persuade the White House to suspend planned steel and aluminium duties on the EU and other allies.

&gt;Meanwhile, the refugee crisis is expanding German horizons. At its peak Mrs Merkel requested a map shaded to highlight Germany’s true borders: North Africa, Ukraine and Turkey. Then at last year’s G20 summit in Hamburg the chancellor advanced a “Compact with Africa” to accelerate development and improve governance on the continent. Though overhyped and underfunded, it gives a hint of the convening and stabilising role a normalised Germany could yet play.

&gt;All of which makes the character of Mrs Merkel’s successor pivotal. Her uncontentious, reactive style has suited her times. But a new Germany requires a different type of chancellor: proactive at home, ambitious abroad and with the skills to persuade German voters of the case for this ambition.

&gt;With the right leadership, there is little doubt about the country’s capability. In its latest historical phase alone it has absorbed the sclerotic, ex-communist east, overcome economic crisis in the early 2000s, taken in over 1m poor, often desperate immigrants—and coped. Now, as in the past, it would be a mistake to underestimate Germany.

I don't know of any politician over here that actually *spies* on opposition politicians. Get informed about them? Of course. But spy? And slandering doesn't happen that often over here either. If it does happen, it's mostly done by national-populists similar to Orban. Other than that, not much. 

But hey, I live in the developed part of Europe.

But go ahead and ignore the rest of what he said. People like you always like to cherrypick:

&gt; Paid men to vandalize opposition posters (while the police watched them in civil cars) and refused to have public debates.

Over here we have a couple of politicians refusing public debates as well. But only the same kind of national-populists like Orban. The rest of our politicians, the decent ones, still debate like they should. Cause that's what you do in a democracy.

Men getting paid to vandalize opposition posters (while the police watched them in civil cars) *definitely* doesn't happen over here.

Btw, why are you using quotation marks when describing democracy? Are you one of those conspiracy theorists claiming the EU is a dictatorship?

&gt;Orban and similar political forces across the Europe are gaining strength...

They have been gaining strenght indeed. But that was bound to happen anyway. Those forces were always present in our society. Hidden, but present. But in some countries it seems they've reached their maximum already though (Netherlands) and in others their support is even declining (UK). Both the Netherlands and France rejected that kind of populism in their latest elections. Gaining strength? Sure, but it's relative. They seem to have a maximum, especially in the developed part of Europe, and they are rejected by a large part of the population as well. Besides that, it only takes time for people to see that those national-populists do not offer solutions and only make things worse. That [always](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_and_inequality_how_populists_mislead_people) happens in the end with those kind of people. We only have to look across the ocean to see that happening already.

1952,"Some fun facts about Yuri Gagarin: 

- He was pretty short and had problems making a clean landing as a pilot since he apparently couldn't see the runway properly. His solution? Sit on some cushions. 

- When he landed after his space flight he was pretty much in the middle of nowhere (a pattern with soviet flights, since they had no water landings. Gherman Titov had to offer first aid to a lady who saw him land, drove her car over uneven terrain to get to him to help and then banged her head on the steering wheel since she was going way too fast). Some random soviet farmer lady and her granddaughter (iirc they were planting potatoes) saw him come up, weird orange get up and all, and he introduced himself with the words that he had ""descended from space"". I'm sure that reassured them (she did help him take off his helmet and offered him milk though). Here's the actual quote: 

&gt;When they saw me in my space suit and the parachute dragging alongside as I walked, they started to back away in fear. I told them, don’t be afraid, I am a Soviet citizen like you, who has descended from space. And I must find a telephone to call Moscow

- When Valentina Tereshkova was selected for the first flight of a woman (Nikolai Kamanin, head of the cosmonaut training, called her 'Gagarin in a skirt' since their characters &amp; backgrounds were quite similar) Gagarin apparently noticed her nervousness and sympathized with her, saying: ""I understand stand you. It’s hard to be the first"". Gagarin also gave her her callsign ""seagull""

- During the period of staying in an isolation chamber, each Cosmonaut had to do something to not lose their minds. Gagarin sang. He also sang during re-entry.
(Andriyan Nikolayev painted winter landscapes to distract himself from the heat tests that were performed)

- Most of the control over the Vostok spacecraft was handled on the ground. There was a code to override it and establish manual control for the pilot, which was kept in the cabin as a sort of compromise so the cosmonaut could only use it in an emergency. Lead Engineer Sergei Korelev whispered the code to him while he got strapped in. As did a bunch of other engineers and flight technicians. Even though they could lose their job over it, they wanted him to know it. 

- Valentina Tereshkova says he had been collecting notes for a second book, one closer to the 'real' story and ""[...] a very serious book, not only on the preparation and the spaceflight but also on the history of the Soviet cosmonauts."" Gagarin also detested the fact that he was relegated to a ground job after his flight.  

- [Here is a picture of him dressed as neptune](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryPorn/comments/38vchm/yuri_gagarin_at_a_party_for_cosmonauts_1965/)

No, the point was if it is active support. It isn't. It is passive.

I'd have zero problems with any of this if people joined the church out of their own volition.

This has no relevance to whether people have been indoctrinated.

&gt;The entire core of the problem here is that in this case the vast majority of people have never signed up for this service themselves, and do not need/want it, but people still keep paying for it.

2071,"&gt;If it was still in question, at least the CIA looks tell us pretty much that they think the mafia in Russia has connections to the highest level of government. Add to that how the country is 'steeling' from their people, Oligarchs collecting all the money while the average citizen is poor and calling it a Mafia state isn't dishonest anymore.

Well, like I said, I don't know how much Russia is a mafia state in reality. But the term is still a loaded one and would never be used if relations were fine with Russia. 

&gt;To me, murdering your opponents, oppressing the opposition and taking the freedom away from 145 million people is pretty evil. But hey, maybe you think differently.

I don't think 145 million people would largely support Putin if they had lost their freedoms or if he was an EVIL leader... Yes, opposition is being harassed and disenfranchised, but such is the way dictatorships work. Democracy is not some divine thing that is objectively and universally the way things should be. That's just the way it works in the West. 

I'm 105% sure that when Xi Jinping steps down as the leader of China, China has changed tremendously while we have just maintained the status quo without changing anything in the way our countries work... 

&gt;We had a news from RT recently, doesn't seem like its banned. And ofc the majority of Reddit is biased as fuck, often to the point of delusion. That's standard on this site.

Well, I remember once commenting RT(dot)com and my comment was automatically removed... 

&gt;And no reason to limit it to American elections; we know Russia is financially and otherwise supporting lots of disruptive and anti-european political parties in Europe. Maybe not everything is true, but the amount of evidence and reports makes it the intent pretty obvious.

They are, there's no doubt about it. There has been pictures circulating about the leaders of our ""Finland first"" movement visiting Donetsk and even speaking on television. But again, do similar groups exist thanks to Russian influence, or do they exist because people really are becoming more euroskeptic and Russia has just thrown some gas into the flames? In my opinion, the root cause for euroskepticism comes from EU itself, and Russia takes advantage of that. 

&gt;Calling it ""Western"" is a bit of an unintentional lie in itself. It's a generalization of dozens of different states with diverse cultures. Everyone of those countries has thousands or tens of thousands of news outlets, some also pro russian. Some countries are even pro Russian, eg Serbia.

But the biggest and most popular media outlets are generally Western. Of course there are always alternative sources, but they can hardly be called mainstream. 

&gt;Can't really compare that to Russia, with it's extensive state media and being one of the most dangerous places on earth for journalists.

Well, they have their own bias. Here the ones who have the money dictate what we see, and there it's the Russian government. 

&gt;Sure it is a matter of perspective. But you can also be open minded and consider the vast spectrum of news and evidence. Some people can do that better than others, that's even scientifically proven. And the crux here is that the western, democratic model is provenly superior. Not perfect, but the standards of living, personal freedom and safety are far above any autocracy. So in comparision, Russia suffers, and that is why the countries government is often derided. Some try to paint that as arrogance, but there is more behind that.

Well, I'm not saying the Western model is not better. I mean, personally I think it's utter shit from almost every aspect, but that's just me. It is probably better as a whole. But the difference is not like day and night. When you look at Russians, they don't look very suffering. They still have decent quality of life and are largely supportive for their leadership. Especially when you compare the current situation to the one 20 years ago when American ""shock therapy"" had entirely fucked up Russia's economy. 

&gt;I mean, like who gives a shit if the state is 'strong' in a geopolitical sense? What is even strength in national concepts? That alone is something you can extensively debate. In the west, we like to take humanist principles. And yes, my bias tells me they are more important than nationalism.

I do care about nationalism because currently I'm seeing my country eroded from the inside by promoting values inherently hostile to it, and that's directly the fault of the system the whole (Western) world has submitted. Serving the multinational interests goes above everything else. People rather climb up the sweet corporate ladder than form healthy and happy families. And with the money get, they buy useless shit because corporate propaganda tells them to. The only thing you're supposed to care about is your next paycheck and the short term pleasures you can buy with it. Money is the only thing that is supposed to have any value. What's the point of culture if you can't commercialize it? What's the point of nature if you can't commercialize it? 

And I should be happy that I must study almost 20 years living in a tiny box inside a busy and faceless city, just so I can achieve this state of being? Yayy, high quality of life! High standard of living! I'm depressed and I'm stressed and I'm obese, but at least I have those! I have no real freedoms, only a freedom to consume whatever useless shit I want! 

This society is sick to its core and should be reformed ENTIRELY. We are Nietzsche's last men... 

But yeah, to answer to your question, many people do give a fuck about the strength of one's country, especially Russians.

Tell me how the Skripal family are ''Putin's opposition''. They haven't been relevant since the spy exchange deal with the UK in 2010. It's interesting how I referred to the main argument being used about ''past cases'' and here you are bringing it up since you're dismissing everything else and throwing this around ad nauseam. 

&gt;You say it might not have been Russia, Iran can also make the chemical, so tell us please why do you think Iran is doing it

Yeah, that's precisely what I've demonstrated that it's possible to recreate this nerve agent under the right conditions and any government could have been able to do so. The fact that Iran achieved it with commercially available products just shows how simple it is. The US and UK had undisclosed Novichok programs that were uncovered in the Wikileaks dump in 2010, but they never made it public for fear of terrorists getting a hold of it. There are members outside the OPCW that have not held their chemical weapons stockpile to account, such as Israel and North Korea. Do you want more examples of governments having the possibility to synthesize a Novichok? According to the evidence we have as of now, we know that a Novichok was used. Where do we go from here? Well, we look at all those actors that could've synthesized it and here I am giving relevant examples showing that other governments had the *capabilities* to do so. You're actively trying to dismiss this claims for reasons I cannot understand. Your argument has ultimately succumbed to being:

- Putin, *allegedly* did the same on UK soil many years ago. He must've done it again. Then I ask you, *cui bono*? Do you honestly think it's a case of ''sending a message'' that makes it sound as if this scenario is taken directly out of a Clancy international spy thriller.

2123,"&gt;I provided the dictionary definition of the word indoctrination and this doesn't qualify.

But it does, it totally does: look at the definition you used: ""the process of teaching a person or group to accept a set of beliefs uncritically.""

You're saying that because the people don't accept the theological claims of the church it means they're not indoctrinated. I'm saying that even though they're not _religiously_ indoctrinated they're still indoctrinated to the extent that they're continuing to give money to said establishment. They accept the fact that their income is being taken by the church uncritically and do nothing to change it, even though they could very easily do so.
 
If I got a bunch of people to send me money each and every month even though we disagree on what the money is being used for, it would be the same deal: in that case I wouldn't have indoctrinated these people to share my beliefs, but I'd have successfully indoctrinated them to support me financially.


&gt;They are passively supporting the church because the money is just taken out of their pocket unless and until they actively take measures to stop it.

But not resigning from the church is still an an act. It's an active  _choice_ to continue to send money to the church. Just because their parents made the original decisions to join them to their church does not mean it's not an _active choice_ on the part of the people to stay on the church.

I resigned immediately when I reached the age of being able to do so precisely because not doing so is a statement of support for the church and I did not want any part of my income to go towards that. 

Now, is it true that some people simply don't care? Sure, sure it's true, but again: the fact that the church has pulled off via long history and in co-operation with the educational system (the religious teaching received by members of the church is crafted by the church in part) this thing were a segment of people go: 'yeah take my money even though I disagree with what you're using it for' is proof that the church has managed to essentially brand itself as a harmless establishment that people are entirely fine supporting monetarily based on a decision made by their parents.

It's like if your parents signed you up for Spotify at birth and you never used it but kept paying for it for your entire life. The fact that you're not using the product does not negate the fact that you've still been convinced, either by the company itself, your parents, or the culture around you that it's worth paying for. In that case saying that 'oh these people are not indoctrinated because they never even use spotify! is not a counter-argument.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/8bdv4z/german_state_looks_to_ban_headscarves_for_girls/dx8jl88/,ZenOfPerkele,1523532880

2155,"Sargentini is a textbook case of an ultraliberal, but if you like, do it, Poland will veto it anyway or Czechia or Slovakia. Or Austria. And I can think of others. 

Look, it's clear. There are incompatible values in the EU. The question is whether we should split over it or accept that things will be done differently in different countries.

Mostly I mean that you guys want to take liberal values absolutely to the wall. While kind of consider liberal values a good idea in theory, but if in practice they do not work well we more pragmatic and flexible. Meaning

1) If human rights means being overran by fake asylum seekers, well, too bad for human rights

2) If juridicial independence means letting old Communist judges let their old thieving  comrades go,  well, too bad for juridical independence (Poland)

3) If liberal democracy means the global liberal establishment can pay a lot of activists and journalists to spread a propaganda that undermines your basic safety, well, too bad for liberal democracy (Hungary)

It doesn ot mean these values are not good, but we are not going to take them as entirely absolute but only use them when they work well and break them when they don't.

I think we should not split over this because there are other useful things, like trade. But it should be accepted now that different countries do things differently.

No, Nation states are not responsible for that. Migrants bore whole responsibility for better integration on themselves.

Latvians who migrate to Germany, overwhelmingly give their children ""German"" first names and make sure that they will be able to speak German without accent. They do the same in UK, Ireland, Sweden etc.

2233,"Then you may find it interesting that the majority of the Turkish diaspora in Europe (or anywhere else for that matter) is pretty much a very condensed version of pro-government rural people with very low levels of education and/or skills (exceptions are of course a big reality but you don't see those people swearing at Kurds or Arabs). So it's pretty normal that your experiences do not reflect reality and I don't blame you for that.  

To clarify things even further, at least 50-60% of the people in Turkey (even more) have ARABIC names. At least 15-20% have KURDISH names. So how can someone claim that people in Turkey with Arabic and Kurdish names are turned away by companies? Even our president has two Arabic names. This is a huge lack of knowledge and generalization. 70-80% of the Turkish people have these names so it's extremely ignorant and orientalist view.

From my understanding competition over here for example is much fiercer which means companies can get away with smaller margins, pushing the price down. 

Companies are milking eastern Europe to quite some degree because they can get away with it due to overall lower amount of competition (it helps to be able to swoop in and buy up stuff).

2249,"&gt; You know very well what that means.

No, I don't. You said language isn't a feature of nativity. Are you going to say it's direct descent, like a blood tie? You do not tell me what the connection between the dead and living is. You just call them the same thing and expect me to accept that without question. Some logic.

&gt; You've said in some other reply that Turks lived in the Balkans for 600 years. No Turk lived there for 600 years either. Ottokebab being Ottokebab again.

Yes, to contradict your statements. I am not concerned with a word I can't even define properly. If somebody is born and raised on a piece of dirt that's enough for me to say they're from that piece of dirt. You shit attempts are racist slurs are not amusing in the slightest, they're also terrible enough to not cause any injury.

&gt; You don't need to state word by word an opinion about something in order for other people to read between the lines and get an idea of what you're inclined to believe. You say no one is native to any place basically beause they all got there from somewhere else. If you didn't believe so, you wouldn't use this argument all the time I assume.

I don't subscribe to a binary definition of nativity. I stated this clearly, therefore me using counterexamples to get _clarifications_ in return is completely normal. You haven't told me what the cut-off time is. You evade explaining your criteria is every time I demand clarification.

This is a very simple process: You define what you mean by something, so we can argue about substance rather than semantics. Until you provide a definition this is where we are: ""I am native and they're not because I say so and I won't tell you clearly why.""

&gt; Me showing sympathy to one group over the other doesn't mean anything. I'm allowed to have a bias, I never claimed to be 100% objective.

It shows your sympathy for one group over the other. It shows your bias. You claimed multiple times to be objective, saying that you were just stating facts and providing historical information.

&gt; In fact that's what really happened, Romanians (Vlachs and Moldovans) sucked up to it. Shit happens. This doesn't mean I have to agree with it.

It also doesn't mean you get to excuse atrocities committed by people you like.

&gt; Yeah, I'm sorry, your Ottokebab empire was so great, it influenced the world in so many ways. Compare it to other big empires of the time and you'll see it was a shitty empire, based on military power mainly. I fail to remember one cultural movement that started in the Ottoman Empire and is known worldwide today. There's no mention of it in universal literature, art, music etc. Some dude writing poems about Allah and fucking 40 virings doesn't make it art.

All empires are based on military power. Show me one empire that isn't.

Please show me a single Ottoman poem about fucking 40 virgins. Put some substance in your beliefs. Go on. Don't be such a child who can't stand behind what they're saying.

Despite the fact that there is no such thing as ""universal art"", the Ottomans both had their flourishing of the arts and influenced European artists. The reason philistines such as yourself are unaware of this is because this flourishing happened outside of what you perceive to be the renaissance and had more in common with Persian art. Despite this, here you go;

All the communication to rest of the world is cut off so they can't claim it was CIA sabotage and bourgeoise propaganda. They are not allowed to trade with capitalist countries so they can't claim they were subject to imperialist economic dictating. We give them their own intranet. We put Chomsky as their leader, he has been longest telling everyone how things should be ran, so let's see him run things for once, give him full reign over 200 million people. This complete liberation of everyone on terms they themself have propagated as true freedom is, in fact, the greatest possible display of selfless human empathy.

*Toomas Hendrik Ilves, the president of Estonia who visited Israel this week, has the chutzpah to openly say explicit and distorted things, even at the President's Residence in Jerusalem. The two nations, the Jews and the Estonians, so he said, ""are partners to the same historical experience.""*

Your president showed a great sense of humour.

[Most people in Estonia](https://www.haaretz.com/whdcMobileSite/1.5143154), *just like the citizens of its two Baltic neighbors Lithuania and Latvia, welcomed the arrival of the Nazis and considered them liberators and not conquerors. It was the good fortune of the Jews of Estonia that, after the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, they held back for a few weeks until they were ready to overrun that country. In the meantime, around 3,500 Jews managed to escape to the Soviet Union.*

*Of the approximately 1,000 Jews who remained in Estonia, 993 were murdered by the Nazis and their Estonian collaborators. Thousands of European Jews were transported by the Nazis to Estonia and murdered in the concentration camps there. The camp guards were Estonians. The 36th battalion of the Estonian security police took part alongside the SS in the mass shooting of the Jews of Nowogrodek in what is now Belarus.*

Estonians are so proud of their Nazi past that they hold yearly parades of SS veterans.",,/r/europe/comments/8bfake/in_a_new_cold_war_with_russia_balkans_become_a/dx8d7d4/,tristes_tigres,1523518925

&gt;
&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_status_referendum,_2014#Post-referendum_polls

That's one of the polls I was talking about. After the invasion.

&gt;Crimea's independence and/or joining of Russia was something Crimea had been trying to hold a referendum about for a looong time but Ukraine blocked it all the time probably because they knew damned well what the referendum would be turning out to.

Even if there isn't a public referendum, there are polls. 

Can't find the link right now because google is being stupid and doesn't give me the old results, but there were multiple polls in 2012 and 2013 were crimeans were perfectly happy with their situation as an autonomous part of Ukraine. IIRC only 23% thought anexxation by Russia would be a good thing. They even identified more as Crimeans than as Russians.    
I mean, I'm german, we got a history with Austria that shows how a national awareness can grow over time. Of course, it's not in Russias interest to let that happen.

&gt;This is most definitely a situation which at the very least was far more nuanced than a lot of the media reported and if anything the media reporting where I live (Netherlands) was pure and utter propaganda designed to paint Russia as the bad guy while doing my own research I'd really conclude that Ukraine was way more of a bad guy and most of the international community siding with them did so not because of the actual situation but to be able to use it as a political vessel against Russia. If it was another country doing the exact same thing that wasn't Russia like say the exact same situation happened except a part of Mexico wanted to join the US like that and the US let them in in the exact same with the exact same circumstances you can bet that the exact same referendum is suddenly declared valid by all those nations.

I'm honestly not sure what german mass media said about the whole thing, bunch of our further left and right love Russia; but I got most of that information from American and British sites. They did note that, yes, there were a bunch of polls after the invasion showing now Crimeans want annexation. Actually took me a while to find out that those are all post-invasion and Crimeans had the opposite view before euro-maidan.

What stands is that nobody asked the Crimeans. Only after Russian invasion they seem to prefer annexation. While I didn't see save number on it, it seems about the same with Donbass at this point. Cut off from the world, treated like a part of Russia, they'd just prefer it to be over and be annexed.

* People do not purchase identical houses.  That is, in the US, a house built in 1947 would tend to be much smaller than one built today.  The average sales price of a house may rise, but that doesn't mean that any given house is rising in value.  I believe that the Case-Schiller Index takes this into account, so this one may too.  Point is, the average price of a house available on the market may not be connected to whether houses have seen increases in value, and visa versa.

* If what we care about is how affordable a house is, this also may not matter.  If people start making more money, they may choose to buy more-expensive houses.  But there may still be plenty of stock available for someone willing to spend less.

* House prices in a country do not change as a unit.

2529,"&gt;You don't know how industrial production works, to put it bluntly. You don't require an entire new factory specialised for an inferior version of the same product. These products are often made in the same factory, with the same equipment, but differences in materials supplied.


And there's no problem changing products like that once the bill comes into force.

However plenty of products have origin country stamped.
That happens to be different.  So you say they lie about country of manufacture?

 And just happen to like, what, torturing EE by providing inferior product for slightly higher price than WE pays for product that looks exactly the same externally?


&gt;This is the 21st century, there is no such thing as ""exorbitant shipping fees"", especially in the Union.

It's exhorboant in context of regular consumer shopping.

Well, so adding a +30eur for each source you are ordering your monthly products from should be NBD?  (As you won't find single online seller that sells everything, ships to your country and does not have an often silent limit on how many items they will ship? So, your monthly pantry bill is probably up 150eur or so. Average monthly salary is 700eur posttax.

Yes, shipping from UK is significantly cheaper, but UK is an outlier and brexit looms - and anyway it adds up once you account for forwarding services and having to maintain an open UK issued credit card just to be able to shop online for stuff that's not sold to people with EE cards even with uk shipping address.

These are the biggest settlements in history, all of which happened in the US

&gt;TOBACCO SETTLEMENTS FOR $206 BILLION
In 1998, Philip Morris, RJ Reynolds, and two other tobacco companies agreed to a $206 billion settlement, at a minimum, covering medical costs for smoking-related illnesses. Attorneys general for 46 states participated in the settlement, providing annual payments over 25 years.


&gt;BP GULF OF MEXICO OIL SPILL $20 BILLION
In 2016, a federal judge in New Orleans granted final approval to an estimated $20 billion settlement resolving civil claims over environmental damage from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Most of the funds cover federal claims and penalties, while approximately $5 billion to $6 billion provides payments to state and local governments. Like the tobacco settlements above, this is not a traditional class action because it was led by public prosecutors rather than the plaintiff’s bar

&gt;VOLKSWAGEN EMISSIONS SCANDAL $14.7 BILLION
In 2016, a federal judge in San Francisco approved a $14.7 billion settlement resulting from a Volkwagen scheme to cheat emission tests on its diesel cars. The settlement provides funds for vehicle buybacks at market values prior to the scandal, plus additional cash payments for 475,000 diesel car owners.


&gt;ENRON SECURITIES FRAUD $7.2 BILLION
In 2008, a federal judge in Houston approved a $7.2 billion settlement resolving claims that the energy trading company Enron defrauded shareholders prior to declaring bankruptcy. JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce provided over 90 percent of the settlement funds. About 1.5 million individual and institutional investors were expected to receive payments. The settlement includes a $2 billion deal between Citigroup and the University of California, the lead plaintiff that represented Enron investors. Former Enron executives Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling were convicted of conspiracy and fraud for their roles in the scandal.


&gt;WORLDCOM ACCOUNTING SCANDAL $6.1 BILLION
In 2005, a federal judge in New York concluded settlements totaling approximately $6.1 billion in shareholder fraud litigation against the telecommunications company WorldCom. New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi led the case on behalf of WorldCom stock and bond holders, including New York State’s public pension fund. JP Morgan Chase agreed to pay $2 billion of the total. Other banks involved in the settlement include Bank of America and Citigroup. Former WorldCom CEO Bernie Ebbers and CFO Scott Sullivan have served jail time for their part in the WorldCom accounting scandal.


&gt;FEN-PHEN DIET DRUGS $3.8 BILLION
In 2000, a federal judge in Philadelphia approved a $3.75 billion settlement over a diet drug known as fen-phen that had been associated with potentially fatal heart valve damage. Six million people reportedly used fen-phen, sold by American Home Products, before it was pulled from the market in 1997. The settlement provides up to $1.5 million to users, depending on their injuries and how long they used the drug.

Poor or unsophisticated consumers cannot afford to pay lawyers in most European countries. They have no way to sue in the first place. Even if 100% of the award would go to the consumer, that does nothing if the consumer can't afford to file a lawsuit in the first place. The only people who benefit from this system are rich people who can afford to enforce their rights. It's a joke. Also, the lawyer with a contingent fee only gets paid if he wins the case. The flip side is that he gets nothing if the plaintiff loses.

But the whole of your text is based on «them vs us», as if there was a special category for every single person on earth you dont consider to belong to your identity group and those people had interests that were against yours.

Imho, being a cosmopolitan and an internationalist is not about spreading your lega and becoming the lover of the USA. Its about selling what you produce to those in need, regardless of wether they fall in or out of your frontiers, and allowing someone fron the «outside» to help me out with that which I cannot do myself.

The idea is to bring that notion of identity (inner group) and expand it to encompass all people.

Ofc, Im guessing the key to this whole thing is simmetry, one can absorb positive traits that were not present in «his» culture/state but just as long as other places are also open to absorb whatever good things you jave produced.

If the big enterprises of your country are controled by private and public agencies not belonging to your state logic mandates that they would act on the interests of those they serve. If on the contrary they didnt and they politically favored an other group in detriment of Romanians, then Im guessing they are rather the opposite of cosmopolitan, they are relwntless nationalists expanding their agenda not caring about the interests of «others».",Earth,/r/europe/comments/8bgtj9/armenfrancesca_banciu_my_fatherland_is_the_worl/dx871eg/,Tavirio,1523507929

Probably.

&gt; If they could pass on those costs they would already have increased their prices in order to increase their profits.

There are two errors here that I see.

First, the environment before and after passing this law is not identical.  Facebook isn't going to charge $5/user/month or whatever if its competitors can act without charging.  But if no social media in the EU is allowed, if the EU blocks all outside providers of social media, does a Great Firewall of Europe, that changes supply available (nothing exists below $5/month, if you want your social media fix), and what the optimal price is.

Second, a company is not *constrained* to charge the optimal price.  That's just what will make it the most money.

2751,"Welcome to capitalism ABC. The cost of something has nothing to do with what it costs to produce, only what people are willing to pay. Also any good capitalist dreams of a monopoly and they are incredibly creative in finding ways to limit your choice. 

From a capitalist perspective: EE are poor and more price conscious than WE. WE knows what this product is supposed to taste like, and is in stable competition through many years with competing brands. EE have no idea what good shit is, so they started to peddle cheaper stuff for more profit. 

Now, that the brand fans are used to the cheap taste and love it, it's really difficult and risky as hell to change the taste of a product! There are countless example of consumer revolts over brand taste
changes. Now they also have to take a hit to their rep by them admitting they peddled crap!

I wouldn't be surprised if they solve this by lowering quality across the board WE+EE to stay profitable over the inevitable backlash. 

As much as I think the situation is unfair for EE consumers.. it is actually an opportunity for local companies to bite into their own market. (And let's face it, lots of local EE stuff is not that good either. EE Capitalists are perhaps even more cynical than WE ones, since they can and do bribe their way out of annoying regulations and the countries have weak systems of company and food control.)

I think this could play out in many ways, will be interesting to see how it plays out, but I think it's not so black and white as many makes it out to be.

When corpos arrived in EE they had fresh, ignorant consumers who were super happy about the feeling of holding a western brand in their hand. So they decided to make more profit, because that is their job. The bosses get fired if they don't make max profit. Companies die because they don't maximize profit. More profitable companies eat them. 

This is capitalism. And changing an established taste is extremely risky, since fans will rage, and the action admits you peddled crap. 

So even if they ""wanted"" to upgrade their products, it's just a horrible business decision to do so. Since reputation is everything to a brand. That's why you buy the brand! You don't have to think, you don't have to risk trying something new, it's simple, and you pay for that.

Anyway, in a way, this decision is democracy at work in the EU. EE voice was heard, and now policy is coming.

2842,"&gt; but... you receive tons of EU funds?

Yeah, but where does that come from? Western companies profit off of us by selling us overpriced garbage, then they pay taxes in their home countries, those taxes go into the EU budget, then the EU money comes to us, when it's our damn money to begin with, and they expect us to be grateful for it. Or something, I dunno. Like I said, I'm not trying to logically argue this, I'm trying to convey the feeling a lot of people have around here, which is that we're being exploited. The fact that the vast majority of people (myself included) haven't the faintest clue about money flow in the EU doesn't help. I feel a lot of political issues would be solved if the EU explained itself better. Or at all.

&gt;What is the reason for high food prices though, is there a lot of competition between supermarkets?

Fuck if I know. Most people here would say ""corporate greed"". Same thing with things like gas prices. Oh the price of crude oil has gone up 5%? Better hike up the price of gas to match! Crude oil down 25%? Whatever, leave it as is. What are the schmucks going to do, walk?

&gt;Are local brands offering better alternatives to the second-rate crap?

No, they've either been bought out and are now also producing crap or been driven out of business.

That's actually something I know does happen. You're a big international company, you flood a market with cheap garbage, people deceived by your heavy advertising buy your garbage because they don't realize it's garbage, that drives the quality local producers out of business, and then you raise the price of your garbage to or even beyond of what the good stuff used to cost while lowering the quality even further. By the time the consumers catch on to what you're doing it's too late, the better alternatives are gone and you remain as the only option, [which you keep the consumers ignorant of by offering the illusion of choice.](https://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/Behind-the-brands-illusion-of-choice-graphic-2048x1351.jpg) Should anyone attempt to start a competing company offering better products, you can just buy it out and make it produce the same crap you're making in different packaging. You can do the same with defunct local brands that you destroyed, bring back the old package but now filled with new crap, to exploit the residual consumer goodwill and nostalgia.

&gt;Isn't that how all new issues get addressed? You have to stand up for yourself to get things done.

* there are **1444 torture,** **2769 restriction of freedom cases**. There are also **112 violations of the body immunity** with at least 1 case of documented rape. **There have been a total number of 1, 764, 056 (almost two million) cases of sexual abuse IN LESS THAN A YEAR.**

Minden egyes szavazókörben ott ült legalább 1-1 delegált minimum az MSZP és a Jobbik színeiben, de az LMP és egyéb pártok is küldtek ilyen delegáltakat ha úgy tartotta kedvük. A fidesz is ugyanezt tette természetesen, így a pártfüggetlen választási bizottságok *mellett* még legalább 3-6 mindenféle pártkatona IS figyelt árgus szemekkel mindenre egész nap. Minden mozzanat legalább háromféleképpen dokumentálva van, és senki nem tud ""félrevonulni"" pl. a névjegyzékkel (amiben aláírnak a választók), hogy belehamisítson bármit, mert legalább öten szólnának rá azonnal, hogy mégis mi a faszt csinál. A nap végén EGYÜTT számolja meg mindenki a szavazatokat, és minden egyes delegált betelefonál a saját pártjához, hogy azonnal jelentse a végeredményt, annak minden fiszfasz részletével, hogy pontosan hány szavazó volt, melyik pártra mennyien szavaztak, hány érvénytelen szavazat volt, stb. Így a jobbik és az MSZP **a teljes ország összes szavazókörének összes adatáról a saját delegáltjainak hálózatán keresztül szerez tudomást**, a választási weblaptól meg minden ilyen szartól teljesen függetlenül. A tiszafütykösi művházban leadott 22 szavazatról ugyanúgy mindent tudnak, mint a legnagyobb pesti választókerületről, és ebbe a fidesz semmilyen formában nem tud beleszólni. Az MSZP hamarabb tud mindenről, mint a választási iroda, vagy annak a honlapja, így aki azt képzeli hogy a honlappal bármit is lehetne manipulálni, annak halvány lila segédfogalma sincs a választások menetéről.

Az meg, hogy sok volt az érvénytelen szavazat megint csak egy hülye kitaláció, minden választáson van egy rakás fasz aki több karikába is ikszel, vagy egybe sem, esetleg valami személyes üzenetet ír ikszelés helyett, de amikor az urnákat kibontják és a elkezdik a szavazatokat számolgatni, akkor ugyanúgy ott vannak az ellenzéki delegáltak, mint az egész nap során bármikor máskor, tehát ott sem lehet semmit variálni. Egész pontosan az történik, hogy a teljes bizottság (7-8 ember) körüláll egy asztalt, senkinél nem lehet toll vagy bármi hasonló, és úgy borítják ki az urnák tartalmát ellenőrzésre, tehát ha valaki érvényes szavazatokat érvényteleníteni akarna plusz X-ek húzásával, eltépéssel vagy ilyesmi, azt 6-7 másik ember (köztük az ellenséges pártok delegáltjainak) orra előtt kellene megtennie úgy, hogy ne vegyék észre.

What it represents for you is irrelevant.

&gt; changing the demographics of a territory by murdering a minority (usually) in order to ensure the dominance of the majority. This was not the case, exactly in order to avoid that, population exchanges happened.

It was the case. There has only been one population exchange between """"""Ottomans"""""" as you call us and Balkan nations. Another display of your ignorance.

&gt; The fact that the language died out doesn't mean the people died out.

You based nativity on language? Do you rescind this claim? Is nativeness not related to language?

&gt;  They got mixed with the Romans, adopted their language and culture.

Yes, they were dominated. Much harsher than the Ottoman treatment. v0v

&gt; We have no idea what Dacian language even looked like, some believe it was related in many ways to Latin, hence the easiness of the Dacians when it came to adopting Latin.

Nationalist wishful thinking.

&gt; People in the Balkans today aren't descendants of the Ottomans who mixed with the natives, that's the difference here.

To some extent they are. If they aren't, it's because the empire chose not to forcefully convert folk or impose the adoption of a culture/language.

&gt; As much as you want to be called European

A strawman used to make yourself feel better. I have no such desire. Being European is a worthless label only the most ignorant pick to feel better about themselves, not even realizing that the very same identity places them in the same category as the nazis and stalin as well. v0v

&gt; Turks in their majority today aren't native to the Balkans

You still have not given me a definition of being native. Neither are the Balkan peoples. All indo-europeans migrated to Europe, the Slavs conquered the area and Romanians are essentially cut from that same cloth.

&gt; Your origins are related to Asia, not Europe.

Same for all indo-europeans. Humanity has origins in Africa. You have offered no definition for the cut-off point for ""origins."" How many years from now will Turks be native to Anatolia? 2000? 4000? 50000? Since when are Romanians native and can fairly be considered to ""originate"" from Romania? You offer no answer.

&gt; They're not ethnic cleansing for me, do I need to repeat that?

Your feelings are irreverent. This is the wikipedia definition of ethnic cleansing: ""Ethnic cleansing is the systematic forced removal of ethnic or racial groups from a given territory by a more powerful ethnic group, often with the intent of making it ethnically homogeneous.""

It includes population exchanges, _by definition_. I don't care if you call a dog a cat. It's still a dog.

&gt; You consider every anti-Turkish crime to be ethnic cleansing it seems, I don't.

A strawman to make yourself feel better. I do no such thing.

&gt; Population exchange was a great thing because it prevented further tensions between Greece and Turkey.

At the cost of the Greeks and Turks who were kicked out of their homes, where they were _actual natives_.

&gt; It's not like Turks were ever a majority in the Balkans either. Also, why should we take out Bulgaria?

Turks being a majority or not is irrelevant. This does not justify the cleansing of Turks in the Balkans. There are hardly any left compared to the historic presence. I took Bulgaria out to make the point of how it is an outlier and that the rest of the Balkans have almost no Turks anymore. If you take out Greece (Thrace), you're left with 50k-100k.

&gt; I don't care what you asked for, I gave you my opinion about it, since you've been demanding it for the last 2-3 posts. 

You contradict your opinion at every turn. We do not care for your shitty historical revisionism, we aren't taking your historical claims or definitions of what happens when an empire collapses as knowledge anyway. You attempted to say that you were just stating facts rather than making moral claims or stating opinions. This is a falsehood, you did all these things.

&gt; In the general context of what happened in the Balkans, with all the ethnic cleansing and stuff, my sympathy still goes to the Greeks, not the Turks.

Once again, you show your tribal inclinations by picking your moral values based on who the subject is. More evidence of your petty nationalist chauvinism. You openly display your bias and in the next breath claim to have none, yet it is plain to see that you value a Greek life more than a Turk's.

&gt; Please do.

The internet took a bad situation and added wasps. Before we had shitty journalists reading scientific papers and overhyping their findings. Now we have blogs taking parts of papers and extrapolaiting conclusions that sometimes directly contradict the conclusion in the paper, get reposted a few times, get's picked up by a lazy second rate news outlet and then explodes on social media.

The same pattern can be found with every other kind of story. Basically, regular people are utter shit at reporting or even compileing the news. I don't know if this is the answer, it's probably not, but at this point I think even a propaganda ministry would be preferable.

Oh, thank goodness I ”twist words”, at least I'm not into whataboutery.

**Austria** - Honestly, I'm rating it as the last one and I'm out of words. It was interesting. I liked it. Was good. One of the best here.

**Azerbaijan** - That was good - music, singer, whole package. Sounded kinda international, it could easly be a Polish entry and I would be completely satisfied with that. Language sounds nice. Btw, she sounds like she starts the sentences with a ""mordo""/""morda"", which is hard to explain/translate popular Polish post-ironic expression (it has meaning of ""dude"", ""mate"", but with different context)

**Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina** - that's cool. I like the flow and how the words sound. And like it somehow feels bosnian without cheap tricks

**Croatia** - Cheap tricks like this. I don't find this kind of stuff funny at all

**Finland** - Damn, those first 30 seconds took me back. Considering I don't listen this type of music at all, it was not that bad. Actually time kinda flew by. Not a strong contender though

**France** is strong. And I like the video a lot (and him, he's kinda ugly, yet sexy). Love the video transitions throughout: sitting - close ups of the body - en face close up. I will check other things by this guy.

**Germany** - I guess it relies too much on text. Musically it's ok, but it's too intense and repetitive for me to enjoy it

**Hungary** is just unlistenable and I'm not talking about only about this bad autotune.

**Iceland** - first beats - fuck, that sounds familiar. Anyway, music was lacking something, but it was alright, vocals not so much. Probably because it was live recording.

**Ireland** - They're nice. Fun, funny, cute. I liked the old hip-hop influences, they incorporated it well.

**Italy** - my toes started to move so I can't deny I liked it

**Moldova** - bonus points for folk/national theme that contributes to originality. Quality of music is very good, I feel it in my ears. One of the best contenders.

**Netherlands** - actually that's something I could listen on my own. Not entirely my cup of tea, but it's interesting, musically diverse. I will check this guy. 

**Polish** one is so calculated and corporate I have no idea how anyone is buying it

**Portugal** - I'm a sucker for portugal language. And she has a nice voice. Like it a lot. Very pleasant song. I will forget it soon, but while it lasted it was nice.

**Romania** - okay, I'm listening. That's something different (honestly I was ready to hear another discoslavo). It's very low key and it doesn't get power to get thorugh, but it was a nice break for ears.

**Serbia** - they think people will upvote this because of the girl? Anyway, it's not very, very bad, better than Hungary, but still - tiring and derivative

**Slovakia** - it's fun. I like the energy and the flow

**Slovenia** - Yeah, it's a straight-up disco-polo with a pinch of polka. That's nothing wrong with that, but the song and the video itself are unoriginal and boring.

**Sweden** - I guess we have another funny entry. Among the genre it's not that bad, but I don't have a heart for this genre, sorry

**Turkey** - another nice one. Interesting sounds, so melodious

**UK** - He's, like, okay? He's obviously a talented pop-rock star, but he's so generic.

3279,"**Showdown in Syria: Donald Trump announces a military attack, Moscow is alarmed. What goals do the Americans have in mind? How does Russia react? Answers to the most important questions.**

 Donald Trump has cancelled his planned Latin American trip and on Wednesday officially only three dates. The US president will sign a law, have lunch with his vice president, Mike Pence, and have dinner with leading Republicans in the evening. Nothing more. Nevertheless, the White House is likely to be very busy - and the focus is on one country: Syria.

After the regime's alleged poison gas attack on the rebel stronghold Duma outside the gates of the capital Damascus this weekend, Trump attacked Bashar al-Assad and his allies Russia and Iran. He wants revenge and now announced a military attack in Syria.

 &gt;Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and smart! you shouldnt be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!
    Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 11, 2018

The European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) has already urged international airlines to be too careful about possible air strikes in the Eastern Mediterranean. The most important facts about the showdown in Syria:

**What will a possible retaliatory strike look like?**

Military experts expect an attack by the USA with ""Cruise Missile"" medium-range missiles, similar to the one year after the poison gas attack on the Syrian city of Chan Sheikhun. Appropriately, the American military reported that the destroyer ""USS Donald Cook"" left Cyprus for the Syrian coast, the ""USS Porter"" could also reach the sea area in a few days. 

The USA had fired 60 missiles from the destroyers, 59 of them reached their target, but the attacked Syrian Air Base in Schairat was rebuilt with Russian help within weeks and has long been in operation again.

**What are the possible goals?**

The main targets of attack are bases of the Syrian army, from which the helicopters or airplanes are said to have taken off with poison gas. There would also have to be special storage facilities for the warfare agents, almost all of them have to be cooled at great expense. Since the equipment needs a lot of energy and you can see cold stores through infrared images, the US and its allies may have been able to locate them.

**What role will France play?**

Although President Macron has spoken out publicly and has been talking about retaliatory strikes for days, his army is likely to play no more than a symbolic role in the attack.

Since France has no destroyer in the region, the only option would be the use of fighter jets, which would easily be intercepted by modern air defence at Syria's borders, which Russia has installed there for Assad in power. Air Force experts therefore consider the use of French jets to be virtually impossible.

**How does Moscow react?**

The Kremlin and other representatives of the leadership have been sending out different signals for weeks: sometimes there is advertising for restraint, the alleged poison gas attack is dismissed as fake news, then sharp warnings are issued.

In Moscow it has also been declared for some time that ""terrorists"" are preparing a poison gas attack that could serve as a pretext for an American military attack against the Syrian leadership. Such an attack would not remain without consequences, chief of staff Valery Gerassimov declared in mid-March. He referred to the Russian soldiers stationed at various Syrian military locations, while military advisers are on duty in Damascus, for example. 

If Russian soldiers are harmed in an attack by the West, Moscow will react with a counter-attack.

It is unclear whether Gerassimov's statement still holds true, because the Russian ambassador to Lebanon declared on Wednesday in Arabic in a TV interview that every American missile would be shot down.

**How is the mood in Russia?**

Tense because it is not clear how the US and the Western allies will proceed now. The state television channels and newspapers close to the Kremlin are lighting up the mood. Their reports focus less on the question of the presumed poison attack in the Duma than on how serious their own threat situation is.

""If there is war tomorrow,"" headlines Moskovsky Komsomolets and lists the fronts on which Russia is forced to fight: the case of poisoned ex-double agent Sergei Skripal, the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the tightened sanctions that have caused a rouble crash, and Syria. The mass newspaper ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" even asks: ""Is Macho Trump starting a third world war?""

The state news channel Rossija 24 showed how people can prepare themselves for the event of war, what food to buy and that, above all, water must be stored - but with the reference that the panic in the USA is much greater.

**What does the situation mean for Putin?**

The situation is ambivalent for the President, who will officially take up his fourth term of office on 7 May after his re-election. On the one hand, he can present himself as Russia's protector. On the other hand, Moscow's military engagement in Syria is not exactly popular with many Russians. They wonder why billions of rubles are spent on the operation when there are a lot of problems in the country itself, such as rising poverty.

This was another reason why Putin announced his victory over the terror militia ""Islamic State"" (IS) and a partial withdrawal of the Russian units at the beginning of December. The fact that Russia could now face a direct confrontation with the USA and the West as a result of an alleged poison attack by the allied Syrian government troops carries great risks.

In Moscow, one sees oneself at eye level and even at an advantage, since one controls the airspace over Syria. But unlike after the use of poison gas in 2013, there is hardly any possibility of averting a counter-attack from the West. At that time Moscow had put an elegant diplomatic solution on the table: Assad's consent to the disposal of chemical weapons. Five years later, there is hardly any room for diplomatic offers.

**Can the UN Security Council still defuse the crisis?**

The chances of this are very slim. In addition to the USA and Russia, China, France and Great Britain are permanent members of the UN Security Council. Anyone can block each other's draft resolutions. 

On Tuesday, the panel discussed three resolutions on recent events in Syria - and all three drafts failed:

Russia prevented a draft resolution of the USA. According to this, it was to be investigated how exactly the use of chemical weapons had taken place in the Duma.
The United States then argued for a resolution according to which the Security Council itself would have assigned the blame as a result of an investigation. Moscow voted against.

A second Russian draft resolution also failed due to the veto of the USA. He called on the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to investigate the events in the Duma - although the OPCW had previously declared that it would send investigators to Syria.

In the meantime, the Russian Syrian special envoy Alexander Lavrenziev is said to have travelled to Iran. He called the alleged use of poison gas in the Duma an ""assertion"".

**Is Israel being blessed with a possible US attack?**

Israel will look closely to Syria in the coming days - and is likely to be informed by the US in the run-up to the attack. Israel and Syria have been officially at war for decades. Both armies are on high alert due to recent events. Two days after the alleged poison gas attack in the Duma, the Syrian military airbase T4 in the province of Homs was attacked from the air - apparently independently of it.

Seven Iranian soldiers were also killed. Russia blames Israel, Iran threatens retaliation. The government in Jerusalem declared that it did not know who carried out the bombing. The Israeli security cabinet around Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to meet on Wednesday.

**Syria to chair disarmament conference**

It is possible that Iran's announced response to the attack may coincide with the West's reaction to the presumed use of poison gas in the Duma. This would give a new dimension to the war on many fronts.

One thing is certain: the Syrian regime will take over the chairmanship of the Geneva Disarmament Conference on 28 May, which also monitors the ban on chemical weapons.

3290,"&gt;That's entirely irrelevant to the point about indoctrination: once a child is baptized he/she is a member of the church. This then turns the burden of proof on its head: instead of being able to freely decide whether or not to join the church, the child/teenager is faced with the notion of: 'Why would you want to leave the community you've been a member of since childhood?'.

This isn't remotely how it works. The baptism means nothing. A baby doesn't even know that it has been baptised.

If the parents are going to raise them christian, then they are going to raise them christian and a splash of water one way or the other makes no difference.

&gt;In fact, looking at statistics of church membership (around 60 %) and number of actual believers in God (somewhere in the 30 % range) it looks to be the case that nearly HALF of the members of the church are only so because they happened to be baptized. If that's not effective indoctrination, I don't know what is.

Wait. You think that the fact that half of the people the church baptised turned out to not believe what the church told them is evidence of **effective** indoctrination.

3296,"&gt; There's even slightly more support since East Germany is less religious and the GDR ""supported"" LGBT rights more than West Germany. 

I find it difficult to believe. Yeah, Ossis might be less religious than Wessis but attitudes toward LGBT issues are not dictated by religion only. The Communists suppressed religious organizations and promoted state atheism, so a lot of former Communist states have people who are not religious but are homophobic.

3325,"I don’t personally think they should be banned, but i think theres an interesting argument to be made. Granted most of the people pushing for this are probably christians who want to promote their own theology, but theres a very real secular component to this as well.

Most veiled women in the muslim world don’t do it out of their own free will. They do it because islamic faith mandates it, and failure to do so puts them in real danger. These women are viewed as whores and are typically disavowed by their own families. They risk having acid thrown in their faces or even worse. Refusing to abide by the rules of the faith in this manner puts women in real peril.

Of course, things are a bit different in the western world. An unveiled woman walking through times square is subject to far less physical danger than if she were walking in saudi arabia. Despite this, islamic fundamentalism is still a legitimate problem in the US. We have to acknowledge the harm, be it physical or social, that a young girl refusing to wear the hijab would be subjected to if her parents were islamic fundamentalists. A law   banning her from wearing it would take the pressure off her, as the parents couldn’t really blame her then.

I don’t think we should go as far as banning young girls to wear the hijab, thats a bit totalitarian to me. But we have to recognize the hijab isnt a symbol of empowerment as muslim apologists might have you believe. Its a tool of oppression for hundreds of millions (if not billions) of women around the globe. Thats like saying a civil war era slave escaped the south and fled to the north, only to continue wearing his shackles out of his own free will. Therefore shackles are a form of empowerment. See how foolish that sounds? Sure you could argue for this specific person they might be, but its dishonest to extend that and say that shackles are empowering.",,/r/europe/comments/8bdv4z/german_state_looks_to_ban_headscarves_for_girls/dx6g436/,popesandusky,1523446492

3331,"Well Libya probably would've been worse off if NATO hadn't acted; remember that no matter what the Russians try to tell you, the civil war was already in full-swing by the time NATO intervened. If not for the air campaign it could well have turned into the sort of bloody, multi-year stalemate that Syria has. Now I absolutely am not calling Libya a success story; there was simply no follow-through once Gaddafi was out of the way, and the situation there is fragile. But ultimately, far fewer lives have been lost in Libya compared to Syria. I think that the results intervention in Libya, as opposed to non-intervention in Syria, is quite clearly the lesser of two evils.

Iraq is another matter entirely, 2003 was not the right moment to invade, and the invasion occurred under a false pretext and was horrendously mishandled. If we were going to act against Saddam, the proper thing to do would have been to wait for a popular uprising against him (such an event is inevitable with those sort of tinpot dictatorships) and then backed the rebels.

You see, I don't propose to start wars, simply to end them. Kosovo, Libya, these are reasonable actions. Iraq certainly not. 

Ultimately we ought to have struck Syria in 2013, Assad would've been toppled in months. The situation would probably be like Libya; bad, but not nearly as bad as it is today.

&gt;“Naftogaz was **awarded damages of $4.63 billion** for Gazprom’s failure to deliver the agreed transit gas volumes,” Naftogaz spokeswoman Olena Osmolovska said. There was no immediate comment from Gazprom.

&gt;Since the court previously ordered Naftogaz to pay Gazprom for gas supply arrears, **the net payment Gazprom will have to make to Ukraine is $2.56 billion, Osmolovska said.**

&gt;But it also ordered Naftogaz to pay $2 billion to Gazprom for the gas arrears and ruled that it should buy 5 bcm of gas from Gazprom annually from 2018.

Since we have to buy gas anyway, might as well honour the revised contract, especially since the price according to the ruling should be slightly better than the one European traders were offering.

Nope. Shinto is also a religion. There's a concept of afterlife (reincarnation), even though there isn't (IIRC) a complete pantheon or monolithic god

&gt;If Karl Marx kept his philosophies on socialism identical but he called it a religion and his followers started to use that word socialism would be known as a religion today

Also nope, a movement based around seizing the means of production couldn't become religion unless a lot changed, and if it did it would no longer be socialism it would be something entirely different

3480,"&gt; Wrong, you twisted my words. I said ""got kicked out of the Balkans"" and by that I meant the Ottoman Empire.

That was not the context in which the post you replied to was speaking.

&gt; What cultural development happeend in the empire?

Architecture, literature, law, you name it. Your ignorance is not a reason to discount these things.

&gt; While Europe was drowning in Renaissence, the Ottomans were making plans on how to conquer Vienna.

Not mutually exclusive. Most European powers were busy going at each others throats and enslaving half the world in the period you want to highlight for an explosion of culture.

&gt; Before the innocent farmers who never agreed with the Porte came to the Balkans, the Ottoman army came.

Not what you limited it to.

&gt; The killing of those people was more than justified, since it was a war and you were invading others.

You're literally writing _you_ in the sentence and implying _Turks as a whole, including myself personally_ are responsible at an individual level. You defend ethnic cleansing even when you're trying to distance yourself from it.

&gt; Now what happened afterwards in the 20th century is a different story. I told you, I don't think those particular farmers were guilty, but neither were the Greek or the Armenian farmers. What goes around, comes around.

Still defending ethnic cleansing by citing tit far tat, when the Ottoman Empire didn't even attempt to cleanse the Balkans in any way until Turkish nationalism became a thing, at which point the Balkans weren't even an Ottoman possession. More ignorance on display.

&gt; What happened in Berlin wasn't ethnic cleansing.

So why did you bring it up? You specifically said you didn't feel sorry for German civilians being raped and murdered and the like. I wasn't the one to bring it up?

&gt; Someone kills 3 Turks tomorrow and you will call it ethnic cleansing too apparently. That was war.

A strawman and a lie. A lie that can be used to excuse Ottoman massacres as well by the way. How shameful.

&gt; The Ottomans committed horrible war crimes as you know already in their attempt to expand their borders. Why should I feel sorry for those in the Ottoman army got tortured and killed?

You did not restrict your definition to the Ottoman army and I never asked you to feel sorry for the Ottoman army. If you're going to state openly that you think the ethnic cleansing by massacre and deportation of Turks in the Balkans (who's descendants make up about 1/4 of Turkey today) was wrong, we can drop this right now.

&gt; I will never consider ethnic cleansing is right

So far you have implied otherwise and made excuses.

&gt; but I also think you gotta have the moral ground to say those things. 

Moral ground to say what?

&gt; While the Ottoman Empire ethnically cleansed millions of people from different countries

Didn't cleanse any ethnicity in the Balkans, although massacres were aplenty. Also ""people from different countries"" were part of the empire back then. This is a really shoddy, lazy statement.

&gt; you should understand that the ethnic cleansing of Turks if you can call it like that was a consequence of that

Either you're defending ethnic cleansing when it's carried our as revenge and justifying it by making excuses for it, or this statement means nothing within the context of the discussion anyway.

3520,"&gt; I hate whataboutism, it's such a cheap tactic, and usually is just used to muddy discussion.

And I hate it when people cry ""whataboutism"" when you point out a dual standard.

Ever since the word ""whataboutism"" popped up it seems like people magically suddenly think you can't criticize people on dual standards and hypocrisy any more because that's suddenly a ""whataboutism"" now.

&gt; Comparing bikinis that I can guarantee 100% the girls want to war themselves

Oh please, let's be honest about that a lot of kids want to run around naked and kids would run around naked if their parents didn't hoist them in clothes.

Parents say all the time to kids of either sex ""No, you can't go around naked outside, put on some clothes!""

The only reason human beings wear clothes when it's warm is because they were socially conditioned to do so as children.

&gt; The hijab is such a disgusting thing in general, it makes Muslims look bad.

It is, so is every single gender role.

But that doesn't defeat that this rule is a massive dual standard and that all the traditional and oppressive German gender roles get to stay and it's  weighing with two measures.

We both know that if this exact same headscarf was a traditional German piece of folk clothing it would _never_ be banned because ""muh cultural heritage"" and parents who put their children in it would be commended for keeping German traditions alive.",Je kon de macht der goden hebben!,/r/europe/comments/8bdv4z/german_state_looks_to_ban_headscarves_for_girls/dx69qhw/,Kringspier_Des_Heren,1523432264

The problem is that you can only prohibit all scarfs or all caps. Otherwise you get discrimination of one religion or another which is prohibited by the Austrian constitution.

(That's why they are thinking about passing the ban as a qualified 2/3 majority with some oppositional forces, elevating it into constitutional status, thus withdrawing it from the jurisdiction of the constitutional court.

As far as sympathy for Saddam Hussein and his baathist Iraq. While I disagreed with the war due to the strategy they were using (invasion), I am happy his regime was toppled.

4. If some Russian servicemen will be killed anyway, Russia will hide it and pretend that nothing has happened, like with Wagner guys, and all reaction will be limited to voicing some angry statements.

The southern and eastern parts Australia is experiencing very hot weather, and in places such as Adelaide, there has been three-four consecutive days of temperatures above 33 degrees. Some places even got to 45 degrees...in April! Talking about the major cities, Adelaide has been the hottest and it’s been a record-breaker here. On Sunday, it was 33, on Monday, it was 34, Tuesday, it was 35, and now today (Wednesday) its a scorching 36 degrees. But a cool change is coming through on Thursday, dropping it to 24. That all means we’ve broken the record of three consecutive days above 33 degrees. And let me tell you something, it’s extremely unusual and it’s pretty much never happened before here. I don’t think I’ve ever seen it reach 36 degrees in April ever. In April it’s usually around the 18-21 degree mark so this is very unusual.

I thought I’d just explain that because it feels like we are still experiencing summer in Australia and over where you guys are in Europe, it’s still feels like winter.

Sure, it 'smells fishy' to you, so you invent some colossal conspiracy by an evil billionaire doctor to do a false-flag attack (why do you guys love false flag attacks so much?) from his secret lair where his minions toil away making advanced chemical weapons to 'unite Britain' that's much more believable than a dictator who kills his enemies as dictators often do, especially from the country in question.

3903,"**French President Macron considers an attack on chemical weapons in Syria possible. A decision will be taken shortly. The US has sent a destroyer to the region.**

In the case of a French military attack against Syria, the Syrian regime's chemical weapons would be the target, according to the government in Paris. According to President Emmanuel Macron, attacks on ""chemical capacities"" are possible.

Macron said after a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Paris that under no circumstances would the allies of the Syrian government, Russian or Iranian units, be attacked. France does not want ""an escalation"".

The decision on an attack in Syria will be announced ""in the next few days"". After the suspected poison gas attack in the Syrian city of Duma, in which at least 150 people were killed, France exchanged experiences with partners - especially with the USA and Great Britain.

Earlier, US President Donald Trump had called British Prime Minister Theresa May. The White House then announced that they both agreed not to allow any further use of chemical weapons in Syria.

**Trump cancels trip to Latin America**

In Paris, the Saudi Crown Prince also made clear his country's willingness to participate in any concerted action against the Syrian Government.

There is currently speculation about a possible retaliatory attack by the US and its allies, in particular France, following the alleged use of poison gas in the rebel stronghold the Duma in Syria. Trump cancelled a trip to Latin America at short notice to deal with the situation in Syria, according to the White House. His minister of defense, Jim Mattis, also cancelled the planned dates for the weekend.

Meanwhile, the US guided missile destroyer ""USS Donald Cook"" has arrived in an area from which it could reach Syria.

The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has issued a notification to aircraft for the Eastern Mediterranean airspace in the Cyprus area. It warns of possible air raids in Syria with air-to-ground missiles and so-called cruise missiles over the next 72 hours. There is a possibility that navigation in this area could be disturbed.

3907,"Well, it's usually just the original name of the place with an -as ending, because almost all masculine nominative case words in Lithuanian have -as endings. But the endings change depending on grammatical cases.


So in Nominative case, Minsk becomes Minsk**as**, in Genitive, Minsk**o**, in Dative Minsk**ui**,  in Accusative, Minsk**ą**, in Instrumental, Minsk**u**, in Locative, Minsk**e**.


A person from Minsk becomes Minsk**ietis/iškis** if male, and Minsk**ietė/iškė** if female.


Some cities are feminine like Warsaw, Varšuva, so no -as ending is necessary, some cities are both feminine and plural, like Mikolaik**os** here. If it wasn't plural it would be Mikolaik**a**.

3916,"Anyway this is becoming really pointless because I am repeating myself the whole time. ARF Armenia =/= ARF =/= MHP I explained why and I showed you their program. ARF Armenia is first and foremost subject to the laws of Armenia, to the whims of the ruling establishment and of the regional politics which are also subject to the powers to be. But none of this matters anyway as that document as I said a million times has to do with reparations and does not in any way imply that ARF Armenia or even are ARF = MHP anyway and that link says nationalism for ARF and yet the MHP link says ultra nationalism. Nationalism =/= ultra nationalism. The Armenian-Turkish issues are not a myth nor are they settled and in fact that was the whole point of the 2009 protocols and one of the reasons why Germany fully recognised the Armenian Genocide in 2015. ASALA and JCAG do not exist anymore. Nor does the USSR nor the Cold War. This is already getting really boring. 

&gt; The MHP's view represents the Nine-Light doctrine, based on Turkish nationalism shaped by Islam. The MHP used to be described as a neo-fascist party[22][25] linked to extremist and violent militias.[26] Since the 1990s it has, under the leadership of Devlet Bahçeli, gradually moderated its programme, turning from ethnic to cultural nationalism and conservatism and stressing the unitary nature of the Turkish state. Notably, it has moved from strict, Kemalist-style secularism to a more pro-Islamic stance, and has – at least in public statements – accepted the rules of parliamentary democracy. Some scholars[who?] doubt the sincerity and credibility of this turn and suspect the party of still pursuing a fascist agenda behind a more moderate and pro-democratic façade. Nevertheless, MHP's mainstream overture has strongly increased its appeal to voters and it has grown to the country's third-strongest party,[27] continuously represented in the National Assembly since 2007 with voter shares well above the 10% threshold.

Yeah exactly the same thing.

3972,"To tie the prosperity of the early 2000s with Fidesz happening to govern in 98-02 tells us one thing for certain: that you don't have the first clue about Hungary's economy and recent economic history. 

If you want a quick rundown on that, I suggest [this video](https://444.hu/2017/11/06/a-nemzeti-diszletepites-rendszerei-1-resz-a-nyugat-kultusza) of evil liberal 444 (you can skip to 3:20 if you want), who will give you a 10-minute summary about what really happened, how the one-time boosting effects of the '90s privatisations have finally ran out by just around the time we've joined the EU and how every government, Socialist or Fidesz have failed to use the money at hand to make the desperately needed improvements and modernizations that the Polish for instance have done (suffered through) in the 90s. 

While the first two Socialist governments were terrible in money management, I feel like you're kind of forgetting a teeny-tiny thing that also happened during their governance. And no, I'm not talking about Őszöd. 

The fault of the '90s Socialists, '98 Fidesz and '02-'10 Socialists is how harder Hungary has fallen compared to regional peers. Maybe 20-30% harder. The other 70-80% was unavoidable and hurt all nations. 

And the rebound happened to all just the same, the economy is booming for everyone. And we're showing one of the most lacklustre growth in Eastern Europe, because our economy is structurally messed up. Between 2005-2016, with 5 years of Socialist and 6 years of Fidesz governance, we have edged [5% closer to the EU-28 average](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00114&amp;plugin=1) (with 2% of that happening in 2010-16), while Poland, Slovakia and the Baltic states recorded total raises between 15 and 22%. We've been 3% weaker than the much richer Czech Republic. And that's with [barely any EU-funding arriving](https://www.portfolio.hu/img/upload/2016/09/eutamogatas160923-20160923.png) (compared to current levels) until the end of 2009. 

The workfare program indeed only accounts for a fraction of employed people. The [numbers](http://www.ksh.hu/docs/hun/xstadat/xstadat_evkozi/e_qli038.html) are publicly available by KSH. Just like the [number of unemployed](http://www.ksh.hu/docs/hun/xstadat/xstadat_evkozi/e_qlf022f.html). And here's the [unemployment rate](http://www.ksh.hu/docs/hun/xstadat/xstadat_evkozi/e_qlf027f.html). 

In Q4 2017 we've had around 135.000 workfare program participants to 175.000 unemployed, the latter amounting to the 3.8% unemployment rate. So with the workfare participants counting as unemployed, the unemployment rate would be around 6.75%, ranked 17th instead of the current 4th, slightly [below the EU-average](https://i.redd.it/l3hi6ralu4j01.png), but significantly worse than the Czech or Polish data. 

It's great that we have wage growth, now the only part I don't love is how it's possible to put up those numbers because we have the third lowest in the entire EU, only ahead of Romania and Bulgaria. Kind of easy to record large % growth when it's small net amounts. I'd much rather get a 3% Luxembourger raise added to my salary. 

But sadly, just like with the economic growth, it will finish out by 2020 as well as EU funds dry up and companies portion out all the ""savings"" they accumulated during the crisis in paying for quality workers.

Given that the people did not change due to migrations as dramatically as the current theory says; ancient DNA testing has revealed genetic continuity in the area of central europe since the Roman iron age. This tells me that; while true that slavs/and the language originated in the east which occurred in the b.c.; their ancestors have been in those areas much longer that we had originally thought. Archeology could only explain the cultural and linguistic strata and change but genetics seems to be painting a much more dynamic picture.

4037,"&gt;“They agreed that reports of a chemical weapons attack in Syria were utterly reprehensible and, if confirmed, 

That's a very big 'if'. The accusation of a chemical weapons attack comes from the Saudi backed/funded, islamist group 'Jaish Al Islam' (army of Islam) which was occupying Douma. In 2013, The leader of JAI, Zahran Alloush, stated: ""The mujahidin of al-Sham will wash the filth of the rafidha (shia/alawites) and the rafidha from al-Sham, they will wash it forever, if God wills it, until they cleanse Bilad al-Sham from the filth of the majus who have fought the religion of God."" [source](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-vocabulary-of-sectarianism). Does this sound like a trustworthy group? Do you understand why the religious minorities in Syria and Lebanon fear massacres and ethnic cleansing if the Syrian government fell?


Gassing a few civilians has no strategic value. [Here is a map of East Ghouta from 1 month ago](https://muraselon.com/en/2018/03/ghouta-map-update-syrian-army-liberates-60-of-east-ghouta-areas/), blue is the area taken by the Syrian army in the last 2 months. [This is the latest map showing almost all of it taken 2 weeks ago](https://muraselon.com/en/2018/03/ghouta-map-update-syrian-army-takes-over-as-militants-surrender/). So the Syrian army is winning on all fronts and gaining ground without using chemical weapons. They retook all of Deir Ezzor and Aleppo without using chemical weapons. They have no reason to use chemical weapons. JAI/Israel have good reason to use or stage chemical weapons as [they are desperate for the US to bomb the Syrian air bases to pieces.](https://twitter.com/camanpour/status/983407942509641729)  A couple of weeks ago, Trump said he was taking the US out of Syria. Israel [didn't like this](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-trump-talk-amid-israel-fears-over-us-plans-to-leave-syria/). Israeli ministers are now [calling on the US to go to war with Syria.](http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Israeli-officals-US-must-strike-in-Syria-549144)

This CW accusation is a pathetic excuse for Saudi Arabia, Israel and the US to get what they always wanted, justification to attack Syria and US military bases to remain in Syria forever.

Attacking Syria and further destabilising it would be utterly reprehensible as well as a war crime.  If you think Syria has chemical weapons then send in inspectors. ",,/r/europe/comments/8bbnke/syria_chemical_attack_uk_us_and_france_agree/dx5ftvw/,[deleted],1523396495

What?  No.  No, it's not.  It's not even close.  Your guess is a paltry shadow of the ones being made by massive intelligence and law enforcement agencies filled with experts of all kinds reviewing physical evidence and gathered intelligence.  

And you're suggesting that a random un-named 'pharma tycon' risks execution and develops a secret lab somewhere undetected, despite needing to hire possibly hundreds of techs and scientists, and train an assassin, to murder some random former Russian spy in the hopes that it somehow 'reunites europe'??  

How is that in any way more plausible than the the scenario where the head of an authoritarian state who has a history of executing his rivals and has made thinly veiled threats to former spies, has access to all the information needed to make the weapons because HIS COUNTRY MADE THEM, believes he is immune to reprisals, has the US POTUS by the balls, and has motive to murder traitors ordered his already existing spy agency to carry it out?

4176,"&gt; We shouldn't be asking ourselves whether this closing down is due to Orbán's victory or not.

Of course we should, if it isnt then its irrelevant.

&gt; The title is correct, by the way, but that doesn't matter. The papers did close down after Orbán's victory. It doesn't state it's directly due to his victory. 

While technically true, its still can be misleading, a title like this suggests its because of Orbans victory.

&gt; But for some, it's always easier to blame the free press instead of recognizing the underlying problems. Apparently, some people are only here on r/europe to divert the attention. 

So questioning or pointing out a misleading title/premise is blaming/diverting attention? Should we just blindly believe anything that is said against Orban or anyone else for that matter? 

&gt; Whether this closing down has anything to do with Orbán or not, doesn't matter much anymore. We are way beyond the point of asking ourselves whether it's directly related to Orbán or not. Fact is, Orbán is making it really difficult for dissenting opinions to be heard in Hungary. And that is textbook authoritarianism. Opposition newspapers closing down, for whatever reason, is part of that whole process. That's what matters.

Of course it matters, if Orban is so bad, why make up things that only invalidate other actual criticisms of him? Your statement about that being a fact is suddenly a lot less believable because of your earlier claim that the reason of shutting down isnt important.

4187,"&gt; **Rajoy sees the German government's action on Puigdemont as ""exemplary""**

&gt; *The President emphasises that Germany is ""a classic and first-class democracy"" because of its respect for the independence of judicial decisions.*

&gt; For Mariano Rajoy, ""the German government's approach has been exemplary"" and its recent behaviour, following the controversial release by the judges of one of its Länder (countries/states of Germany) of the former President of the Generalitat of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont, has been ""that of a classic and first-class European nation"". During a press conference during his official visit to Argentina, the Spanish president tried to reduce the tension that this judicial decision has caused with Angela Merkel's executive after one of his ministers declared that she was waiting for Puigdemont's release.



&gt; Official sources at La Moncloa argued that Rajoy's words of praise for Merkel's cabinet as a whole have to do with the fact that the overall position of the German government remains that of considering that the institutional and political crisis in Catalonia is an internal Spanish matter that must be resolved in accordance with the laws and the current Constitution.

&gt; President Rajoy was reminded that last week he himself had stressed during another official visit to Algeria that Europe could not and should not be just an economic and trade area but a common area of values, democracy and the rule of law and was asked how this is to be reconciled with what has been going on in Germany for a few days now, following his release from Puigdemont prison because judges from the Land of Schleswig-Holstein refused to extradite him on the grounds of rebellion and the unmarking of several German politicians. The Spanish leader reiterated his idea that ""Europe is first and foremost a set of values"". And then he went back to its formation, even before the 1957 Treaty of Rome, to indicate that the founders sought to build ""an area of peace, freedom, human rights and the rule of law with all three powers: that is Europe"".





&gt; Rajoy declared himself to be a ""profound Europeanist"" before reiterating that he had little more to say about the current controversy with Germany than that ""the decisions of the courts are respected and complied with"". The Spanish president continues to support this thesis, which is valid for all judicial matters in general and specifically for the legal strategy followed in the face of the separatist conflict in Catalonia, to the point of stressing once again that you cannot support a democracy or a society in which each person decides for himself which laws and sentences he respects and which he does not. ""That's a democracy,"" he stressed. [sic - translation accurate]

&gt; Under this basic democratic principle, the leader of the PP accepted that the judges in Germany ""can be wrong, like the legislature or the ministers"" and remarked that in this case on the crimes attributed to Puigdemont the Spanish judges, and in particular the Supreme Court, have issued Euro arrest warrants, the prosecutors have supported them and only mentioned that there has also been a German court that has taken a different decision. Rajoy stated that Spain ""will respect the final decision"", in reference to what will happen when the approaches and reports that the Public Prosecutor's Office will now issue in Germany are resolved.

4192,"Ah, the age old question.

Like others before me have said, EU  countries are countries that have embraced ""liberal democracy"" (Much like USA, Japan, even Russia and Turkey) It's not just good ol' democracy. Liberal democracies are fundamentally in opposition to dictatorships. Liberal democracy promotes rule of law, but most importantly it sets politic fundamentals to society that say: ""Look, you're a democracy alright, but the public has agreed beforehand that it has principles that cannot be changed or argued upon"" Therefore dictatorship (with its regular meaning, one person can make any change to any rule in the country) is not possible in liberal democracies. Public cannot be in favour of a dictatorship because public has agreed beforehand that the country cannot be a dictatorship. This kills democracy's fundamental principle that the public can decide whatever. But liberal democracy says that if even one person is against a certain fundamental change, it cannot happen. This doesn't mean that a person cannot be made king-like, but that person must respect the boundaries liberal democracy sets.

4247,"&gt; And I'm not making accusations, just quoting statistics.

You're misinterpreting them.

&gt; Foreigners or [non-Germans](http://www.krimlex.de/artikel.php?BUCHSTABE=&amp;KL_ID=24) are, in accordance with § 2 (1) of the Residence Act, any person who is not German within the meaning of Article 116 (1) of the Basic Law. Accordingly, foreigners who have neither German citizenship nor German ethnicity. Since people who are willing to naturalise and become German citizens are usually naturalized immediately after entering the Federal territory, only German nationality remains as a criterion of distinction. The group of foreigners staying in Germany is very diverse. **These include vested EU citizens, diplomats, workers and self-employed persons with residence permits, foreigners living abroad, pupils and students, tourists and transients, asylum seekers, tolerated foreigners, foreign armed forces and persons who are staying illegally in Germany.**

while

[42.6% of foreign nationals are EU citizens.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Germany#Population)

When people here say ""foreigners"" they automatically think of immigrants as you yourself did.

&gt; ""non-Germans"" (called ""Nichtdeutsche"" in the German version) refers to what would be commonly called ""Immigrants""

Non-Germans and immigrants are not one and the same group. All immigrants are non-Germans but not all non-Germans are immigrants. Most of them, 42.6%, are EU citizens.

So, when you're quoting statistics that show how 38.1% of rapes are committed by ""foreigners"" you need to keep in mind that most of them are EU citizens and not immigrants. Immigrants commit 14.8% of rapes which is in line with their share of the total population.

This was my point all along.

Crime rates, for one particular group, naturally increase as does the size of the group.

Most crimes are committed by German citizens because most people living in Germany are German citizens.

Claiming that foreigners or immigrants commit more crimes relative to their population size is not true.

&gt; a report by the German Federal Office of Criminal Investigation, the number of crimes committed by refugees did not rise in proportion to the number of refugees between 2014–2015. According to Deutsche Welle, ""between 2014 and 2015, the number of crimes committed by refugees increased by 79 percent. Over the same period the number of refugees in Germany increased by 440 percent.""

His 2nd Song, be Deutsch, was quite famous on reddit already. It's a song about being proud to be german, because liberal policies, the way we handle history and all these values of enlightment, as an alternative for the Alt right that's on the rise in most parts of europe. This time the style is similar to Rammstein. It has even english lyrics so most of you will understand it: https://youtu.be/HMQkV5cTuoY

This song now is now tackeling Justitia. The style is once again similar to the Gangster rap scene.

The refrain translates to 'constitutinal patriot - justice is coming and stands above everyone'. This is of course tackeling the tendencies to take freedom rights from the people through surveillance and more rights of the police (he supports an organization that fights for freedom rights through constitutinal challenges) and through the Alt right.

He has some other songs as well, but they are not so politcal, for example a Song written by chimpanzees to show how generic german Pop music has become.

It's a possibility. All I want is the truth, and so far no one has provided it to me. Personally I do believe Russia is responsible, but it could as well be a false flag. 

&gt;Russia was proven to be lying out its ass (and the West were proven to be right) about MH17, Russian forces in East Ukraine, the use of chemical weapons in Syria, bombing UN aid convoys, previous assassinations on British soil and so on, so why does this KGB-lead mafia state still have more credibility?

Breaking News: Great powers tend to lie and twist the truth when it suits their cause. Russia is not an exception. However, that doesn't change the fact that you can't accuse Russia for anything without any proof. 

&gt;I somewhat doubt a state-sponsored assassination attempt would leave ""waterproof evidence"" behind, so how convinced do you need to be to accept that it was Russia? Looking at the cumulative evidence: the type of nerve agent used (military grade, of a type developed by Russia), the target of the nerve agent (a Russian dissident on a Russian hit list) and Russia's extensive history of assassinating Russian dissidents on British soil, it's convincing enough for me to accept the governments assessment that it was Russia.

How easy would it be to use a Russian chemical against a Russian national in your own country, and then accuse Russia? Very easy...

&gt;How convinced would you need to be to accept that the 489th bomb dropped on London during the Blitz was dropped by the Luftwaffe? I mean, lots of countries had developed a capability to drop bombs. Can we know for sure that the Luftwaffe aircraft ""coincidentally"" flying overhead during the time the bombs were dropped were being dropped by them? Maybe they're just sightseeing on the off chance and are being framed by the intercepting RAF aircraft? Perhaps the German bomb fragments were copies made by the British? Also, RAF airfields were located near many bomb sites (how suspicious). Perhaps it was a false flag by the ""war-mongering"" RAF to demonise Nazi’s? How can you really know? Convince me.

They're doing everything they can to provide the appearance of stopping people.  Not the same thing.  Politically-awkward situation: the public does not want immigration, but it must happen to sustain Europe, one way or another, if Europeans cannot be made to have more children.

The aging phase of the EU's society already happened.  The next phase started in 2016, where deaths outpaced live births.  Past birth rates are no longer sufficient to keep EU-28 population up.  Now, barring an increase in fertility, immigration is the only thing keeping the population up.

http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Population_and_population_change_statistics

In future years, the rate of deaths will accelerate more and more as people keep dying, with the (smaller, due to past Europeans not having had children over decades) youthful portion of the population having children increasingly unable to make up for the deaths of their elders.

In 2015, the peak year of the migrant crisis, you pulled net migration of about 1.9 million.

Its only after one of the Super powers failed that you had problems like Yugoslavia, Ukraine war, and Georgia war. Of which the EU proved rather inept. The Srebrenica massacre happened right under the EUs watch after all. 

Also the timing could not have been worse, the EU was given the award in the midst of the immigration crisis and Greek Debt crisis. IF the EU took in these people in some selfless way, or just straight up forgave Greek debt, or became a country to solve the problem, that would be one thing; it did neither and neither problem has actually been solved. Southern Europe is only recovering now from 2008 and all the migrants are very marginalized. The EU went austerity first after all, the opposite of forgive thy neighbor.

4335,"&gt; Extreme claims

My extreme claim is that 'it's a bit different', stop being such an emotional child.

You are a moron, I am sorry. I have prefaced my opinion saying that I do not know much about Finland. From what I know, as I stated multiple times, it is different from the rest of Scandanavia. That does not entail ignorance, that simply shows my own awareness of my lack of information, and that is the reason I haven't made any concrete statements. The fact that you call my opinions 'rather uneducated', shows how much of a complete idiot you are. NO SHIT. I have literally stated that 50 times, I am unaware of many finnish policies. The fact that it took you 4 comments for your brain to process that makes you seem more than a little ignorant.

Secondly, what I'm referencing, the social situations, does not really require me to have a strong idea about Finland itself. I base it on trends that we have seen in many other countries. You can literally see it in elections in Germany. East germans vote considerably different than Western ones.

4396,"&gt; Ethics is a relative thing.

That is no excuse for not even discussing it. Who supports unnecessary circumcision has an ethical issue. In every culture. Maybe different cultures can solve this issue in different ways, but the discussion should be there. I could e.g. ask now, if it is in your culture thinkable and allowed that parents cut of the ears of young babies. We do not really need our ears and you can imagine some strange religious or asthetic reasons. Or to split the tounge of a baby. Cut off half a finger. Nothing would be very harmful. Would you see such things also as a decision of parents? As something strange but acceptable? And you wouldn't say that his should be the decision of an adult for himself, if he wants to follow in this regard the tradition of his ancestors or beauty standards? If you would not allow this, then it is very likely that you make an exception only for what you think is normal for you. And if this is the case, it is very likely that you do not follow any ethics based on logic but only random moral beliefs. 

&gt;Better to have no study, than a study that proves nothing.

It proves that at least these ten babies feel pain as much as an adult. So it doesn't say nothing. It gives at least an indication on how the body in general works. Just saying that the sample size is too small is not very useful when it comes to very basic body functions. Other studies support these findings. 

If you have no study at all for your opinion, then you are just guessing.

4397,"&gt;Ok, the exact shit was ""lists of Jews who pose a 'national security risk'"".

I think you have a weird definition of ""exact"". The *actual* proposal was to have a list of **Israeli-Hungarian dual citizens** in the Parliament.

Which is still not very nice, but it's far cry from *da Jews* you're saying here.

&gt;he most hilarious thing was that the same party claimed it ""grew up"" (exact shit, not ""a shit like that"", so don't panic, calm down) and found out that jews are actually great and should support Jobbik :D

Just where do you get this shit from I wonder... The hilarious thing is that you're very keen on rushing on judgement based on misinformation.

As for antisemitism in Hungary... it's present. However it's no worse than anywhere else in Europe. Moreover it's actually better than in France (and some could argue UK or the US). The antisemitic crimes in Hungary are usually some morons defacing a gravestone in a Jewish cemetery every couple of years, and not shooting up Holocaust Museums (Washington DC) or going on murder rampages.

4398,"I'd say that if anyone is trying to compete in terms of highest quality they're doing it wrong, because what gives higher prices isn't as much quality (which isn't noticeable for anything over 20€), but just the added value that France and Italy have by default. They should be instead competing in other terms.

A good example of marketing is Sumarroca's True Colours, directed to an LGTB audience, which has been selling like crazy... just because of design. It already a normal quality spumous, nothing expceptional but not bad either (very important), but you can boost the prize quite a little through good labelling. It looked for a niche, and found it.

Many of the best wines in Spain, however, keep on with the traditional labelling, and it's there that they can't compete with France or Italy's pedigree. Thinking Rioja's. To me it's quite incompatible, you can't land new targets while keeping the old forms.

I wouldn't say, however, that most of wine produced in Spain is good. There's plenty of mass-produced venom. Only exceptionally, a bottle under 3€ is drinkable, and I may be wrong, but I fear that many of those exports is that kind of wine sold at water price, and then boosted —just because there're places where they don't have vineyards, they'll buy anything.

4424,"So I actually listened to all the entries in their entirety. Took me the better part of the afternoon. I am a bit of metalhead myself so this list might have been a bit out of my comfort zone but I am pleased to say Europe has got some great talent. There wasn’t a single truly terrible song :P. 

One recommendation for the organizers is perhaps to include a short (English) description of what the song is about. We don’t need the entire lyrics but just so we know in which context to listen to it.

Please enjoy my observations as a Dutchy:




Country | -
--|--
**Albania:** | Great start of the eurredditvision contest! Sweet, short and simple song. Albanian (?) really works great as a sung language here.
**Austria:** | After having listened to all the songs I had to come back to this one. I’d say my “douze pointes” go to Austria this year. This is without doubt the most interesting of the bunch. Imho they got every aspect right: great voice, lyrics, music and videoclip. Added to my playlist!
**Azerbaijan:** | Azerbaijanis is another another language that turns out to be a nice language for singing. The song has got a nice beat and I like the voice of the singer.
**Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina:** | What the heck. I have no idea what's going on but I love it!
**Croatia:** | I guess that can be considered music as well ... I think my bobbing head could be used as an excellent power source though.
**Finland:** | I had high hopes for Finland and was not disappointed. I think I will need therapy after I've heard all the songs though. Shame Suomi is still destined to end up underneath the Netherlands in the ranking :/
**France:** | J'adore! Beautifully sung and some good lyrics as well (though my French is very limited). One of the few songs I immediately put on repeat after listening.
**Germany:** | It is always nice to see Jan Böhmermann.  We got a pretty much identical format in the Netherlands now. I think it is a strong song regardless. JUSTITIES!
**Hungary:** | Sorry, I can’t really stand this kind of autotune so no “douze pointes” to Hungary from me. It’s a shame I don’t speak Hungarian. It is hard to judge for me what is going on in this song.
**Iceland:** | Good voice. Can’t help but swing along with the music. It doesn’t strike me as something special though. It probably depends a lot on the lyrics. Are those real working instruments or just props btw?
**Ireland:** | I now understand why most of the songs in the real eurovision are in English these days. Some native languages will just never have a chance.
**Italy:** | Very happy and upbeat song. I like it a lot. The clip makes me think I was watching one of those weird telecom commercials though …
**Moldova:** | Time for a more serious song. I really like the music of this one and it’s got an excellent singer as well. The clip is simple but powerful. This is definitely one of my favourites.
**Netherlands:** | “Wilhelmus van Nassouwe ben ik, van Duitsen bloed, ...”
**Poland:** | We haven’t had much “rocky” songs in this line up so far. I am glad Poland is able to provide. This song has got a great vibe. I think I would place it pretty high in my ranking if I cared enough to actually make one. Has anyone seen their otamatone player though?
**Portugal** | Sweet little song. The singer has a very pleasing voice. This is probably another song that would enjoy the benefits if we got the actual lyrics. I’d say its pretty bland otherwise.
**Romania** | That voice! Certainly something different. I enjoy the calmness of this song. Simple and elegant. 
**Serbia:** | More autotune madness in this song. Again, not really my thing. Serbia got some “interesting” things going on in that video clip though. :P
**Slovakia:** | My roommate wasn’t happy I shattered his plates…
**Slovenia:** | This could be a Dutch “carnavalskraker” with only minor adjustments. Language isn’t necessarily one of them. Best served with lots of alcohol.
**Sweden:** | Song starts with a fart. This must be art.
**Turkey:** | Turkish is a pretty pleasant language to listen to. Especially in gently lapping songs like this one. It’s got a nice videoclip as well.
**United Kingdom:** | The UK obviously has an advantage with the songs they got to choose from. I don’t mind this choice though. I still can’t get over Ezra’s voice/appearance combination. Dude’s got some amazing talent.

Honestly? If you want to get a basic understanding of a topic, Wikipedia has reached a point where it essentially does most of the work for you. 

In fact, I initially googled ""soviet order of battle in the battle of stalingrad"" to demonstrate how improving your special vocabulary and google-fu can help you find more scholarly articles, and the first thing that came up was a word-for-word Wikipedia page of the very topic: [Soviet order of battle in the battle of Stalingrad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_order_of_battle_for_the_Battle_of_Stalingrad)

I was pretty dumbfounded, to be honest.

Now, I'm going to get ballsy and point you straight towards the good stuff. Your adventure can start from the bottom of a Wiki page. A small tip: the more broad a Wikipedia page is, the better its sources. So, start with a broad topic, like [military doctrine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_doctrine) and work your way down. At the very bottom, in the external link section, is where the ""fun"" begins:

First of all, check which links end in .gov or .mil. Governmental and military webpages are always underappreciated. Sometimes, the best way to learn about a complex topic, say doctrine, is go to the webpage called [doctrine](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/development-concepts-and-doctrine-centre#doctrine) and click on a link about, let's say [NATO doctrine](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/allied-joint-publication-ajp). Suddenly, you're presented with megabytes upon megabytes of files and information. You can just start clicking random links and read to your heart's desire.

The issue is that they made a law that is supposed to be above the Constitution and the Statute of Catalonia when they didn't have either the legal right or democratic legitimacy.

It's like if PP makes a law that acts as a temporary Constitution for the country, even though they didn't follow the legal way of reforming the Constitution or even have the necessary majority to do so. I don't care if you're not pointing a gun to the roof, that's still a coup d'etat regardless of there not being violence.

&gt;Well, that's your opinion.

I never said otherwise.

&gt;M. Rajoy's strategy doesn't look like is working.

It's not, which is why I wanted a legal referendum despite not wanting Catalonia to leave.

&gt;What is clear is that everyday more Catalans support the independence

And yet that means nothing if the current strategy means more people in Spain are against a referendum. Either you leave violently and somehow Spain loses or you have to convince the Spanish people and staging coups imo sets you back decades.

Iraq is the biggie for me rather than Snowden. The Snowden leaks didn't really surprise me as I'd assumed that level of observation was taking place. 

'Spies proved guilty of gathering information' didn't really strike a chord. Also it was mostly legal and continues to this day. 

&gt;Well, I respect your optimism.

It's not optimism to say the UK government is more trustworthy than the Russian government, they are entirely different species where public accountability is concerned. 

&gt;I'd say the UK is pretty bad.

It was  a surprise to me when I came to this country that I couldn't bribe police and that appeal/reassessment processes in government departments actually worked and wouldn't be seen as a challenge from the person who's decision you were questioning complete with shit-list. 

I have encountered issues with UK local government but not on the same level I've seen elsewhere. Only Germany was better of the places I've lived (and they earned their reputation for having three forms for everything) and I wasn't there long enough to really see the grime.

- France do import spanish wine. This wine is mostly used to conceive products that contain wine (for it's cheaper than local wine and that the consumer doesn't really care) but are not actual bottles of wine. It is also sold as bottles of wine in supermarkets or cheap unlabelled wine but from my own experience there is only a few bottles of such wine sold in supermarkets compared to french wine, which is why I doubt France was the first importer of spanish wine.

When that happens BEVs will get to or close to price parity with gas powered cars.

When I bring Spanish wine to Australia, it actually gets way more oohs and aahs because it's something a bit different and people are so used to French and Italian wine.

4604,"&gt;You realise most of the ""Quran is awful quotes"" are cherry picked by fascists and have specific context, right? 

I'm not talking about ''kill the infidel'' type discussions, but rather Islam's rejection of homosexuality, transsexualism and gender equality. Especially for the latter, Islam is completely indefensible. Bottom line, I strongly disagree with muslim values, the scripture is preventing them from ever drastically changing, and I don't want them being an influence on the society I live in.

&gt;In cases where this isn't the case, you can always find a Bible quote that's worse. Do you demand of every Christian or Jewish person to ""denounce that turgid scripture"" just so they can be a citizen?

No, and nor would I require it of muslim citizens. Citizenship is not something I'd put ever requirements on for those that already have it. That'd be a very slipperly slope.

There is a huge difference in legal terms between a participation process and a referendum. I encourage you to read about them if you don't know it.

&gt; Which is what happens when you participate in embezzlement of funds and do an illegal referendum. Nothing new here.

A participation process can legally be held by the Catalan government. Again, read a bit about what you are talking, please.

&gt; Then explain why were the Guardia Civil trapped there for hours if it was that easy to get out. I highly doubt they stayed there because they wanted to.

That was their choice. They had a safe corridor to cross (one line made by volunteers and another one by Catalan police). I understand that if there is a huge demonstration in front you might just stay a little bit longer inside so you don't have to go out during the demonstration, but still, that was their choice and nobody forced them to stay there.

&gt; Economical privileges or independence. My, what a negotiation offer. 

Huh, what? Catalan politicians wanted to negotiate about everything. You can listen to any of their speeches, they always say they are open to negotiate about everything without red lines. And the Spanish government is always denying any talk with Catalans.

&gt; That does not mean they did not declare it. That only means they were stupid when doing it. Apart from that you never know what could have happened when declaring it. That was risky, completely idiotic and a crime nontheless.

They didn't declare it legally just made a symbolic declaration. Again, read a bit about what happened those days because you look very uninformed.",Nomad originary from Catalonia,/r/europe/comments/8b5s46/arrested_at_least_four_members_of_the_cdr_accused/dx4ae15/,PandaVermell,1523352883

4811,"If any individual is attracted to someone with a very different physical appearance, I don't see a problem with that. Not do I see a problem with a different looking minority.

It is also worth pointing out that the original Hungarians, so to speak, were Asian looking, short, yellow people, rather than the largely slavic genetics of today. 

People always have and always will migrate from one region to another, and it's rather silly to want to limit that based on skin colour of all things. After all, it's not something that can be chosen, nor is it something that impacts whether they can be a productive member of society.

All future Hungarians will not look African, this is absurd. The USA with its _massive_ importation of slaves is the only country which has an actually sizeable black population. Besides, the ""black"" look dilutes after a few generations, this is also the reason no modern Hungarian resembles the steppe nomads of old. Even though a lot of them did migrate to Carpathia, there was a larger agrarian Slavic population that the Hungarians at the time would have had children with.

Blending in visually should only _really_ be important in the way someone acts and dresses. In other words, blending in _culturally_ is the important factor, because skin colour is inconsequential.

To illustrate my points, there's actually a tribe of Hungarian descent in Africa, likely ending up there during or after the Ottoman occupation of Hungary. They look African and they no longer speak Hungarian, at least nothing resembling modern standard Hungarian, but the story of their people is alive and well. Some people moved to Hungary, and despite it being a foreign cultural to them and despite being Muslim, they integrated wonderfully. Knowing this story and feeling some sort of ethnic continuity, Hungarians were more accepting of them, even though they were really just as foreign. This is all they needed to properly integrate into Hungarian society, a chance.

Clearly not every migrant is like this, but even so, the majority won't cause problems, certainly less problems than the already present Roma people, for example. In fact, coming from Islamic cultures where ""eye for an eye"" is more common, they may actually be less criminal than the average Hungarian in a lot of ways. 

Sweden is mocked a lot, but they effectively spread western liberal values among the children of immigrants, creating a rift between parents and children, if the parents don't adapt. This means, in a generation, they're well integrated and quite possibly look down on reactionary Islam and extremism.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8apvtj/hungarian_elections_megathread/dx43wb7/,GalaXion24,1523338924

4826,"I think the craze about EQ is recent, and there are countries where this is more frequent than others. Sure, we are social emotional creatures, and we are actually smarter now than in the past, but this obsession with positivity and empathy is a modern snake oil. Sorry to say this but I don't think I met one single person who talked about EQ as the solution to everything, who was actually wise. In fact, EQ&gt;IQ is like double jeopardy, it distracts from logic and relies on superstitious intuition and hunches , and then it takes those distracted from logic and mixes them together until misinformation is spread like fire. This is because it's obviously easier to modify EQ than IQ, and you can seem to have any quality you want without actually having it. Of course EQ is promoted, it's like a gift from god for charlatans. The most important quality for manipulators is charm. 

About relying on trustworthiness as a solution, I doubt we can make the chain of trustworthiness work as flawless as digital certificates for example. Especially since trustworthiness is a little bit subjective because it involves having a specific ideology. The right doesn't trust the left and the left doesn't trust the right for example. The right or the left are not the problem, or any other political spectrum, it's the number of times people are actually lied to about what to believe. Politicians who promise something and then don't deliver or even bait and switch.

4892,"To add to this, the romanian communist regime was one of the, if not the most oppresive in europe. The Securitate(political police) was outright brutal(stories about what they did to *ordinary* people dwarf any american horror movie, i cant imagine what they did to actual political opponents). This has been one factor that contributed to the regime’s longevity. Second, Ceausescu started to dislike the USSR’s take on communism after visiting the Far East, and began shifting to Maoist views, especially because he absolutely loved the cult of personality he’d seen in those countries. This lead to megalomaniac ambitions and projects in Bucharest and Romania, but it also meant extreme brainwashing policies were implemented, to the point that impressionable people started seeing him as a god, so that also might’ve had an effect. What is more, because Ceausescu didnt like the USSR that much, he didnt implement the Glasnost and Perestroika policies that well (close to not at all, actually), which lead to Romania being a bit more isolated from the european revolutionary current. The western propaganda played a huge role in the revolution, people would hear about how other countries removed their dictators from power and how they changed to democracy by listening to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (if you were caught listening to these, you were pretty much done for). If only people had known thay the revolution would *not* be as peaceful as they hoped. However, it is also a reason that the youth is quite respected in romania, politically speaking: the students were the first to join the revolution and many of them died. The youth is usually seen as the voice of the future, they are very progressive in values and hold a good presence, especially against the corrupt leftovers of the communist party. Unfortunately, the bulk of the voting demographic is older.

I don’t think they cared about communism nearly as much as Vietnamese nationalism.

China has invaded Vietnam several times over the past 500 years and the Vietnamese relationship with China is about as bad as the Japanese one. The Vietnamese communist party even fought a border war with China in the late 1970’s. 

Nowadays, the US and Vietnam basically have pretty friendly relations because the Vietnamese have buried the hatchet with the Vietname war because they feel more threatened by China. Everyone in Asia feels threatened by China.

4938,"China was barely a statistical rounding error in 1978, with less than 1 percent of global trade, China rose to become in 2013 the world’s leading trading nation with almost a quarter of its annual flows. Nothing on this scale or speed has been witnessed before in history. Since 1970, Asia’s per capita incomes have increased fivefold. Even in Africa, the world’s worst performing continent, incomes have almost doubled. The west’s median income, meanwhile, has barely shifted in the last half century.

In arguing for China’s entry to the World Trade Organization, Bill Clinton, the then US president, said globalization was ‘the economic equivalent of a force of nature, like wind or water’. In addition, he argued that China’s entry would reduce America’s bilateral trade defect by binding China to lower tariff rates on its imports. Following China’s WTO accession in 2001, America’s trade defect with China has leapt almost five fold. It is clear, in retrospect, that Beijing had better grasp of the global economy’s dynamics than Washington.

In terms of purchasing power parity - measured by what you can buy in the local currency - China economy surpassed  the US in 2014. Within a decade, give or take a few years, China will overtake America on more conventional dollar measures. By 2050 - a century after its communist revolution - China's economy is likely to be twice the size of America's and larger than all the Western economies combined.  And by then, even India's economy will be roughly the same size as America's.

4950,"If God does not exist, everything is permitted.

~ Dostoevsky

Modern civilized man cannot endure cruelty, pain and suffering and is more merciful than men of the past, but this is not because he is morally and spiritually higher than they. He fears pain and suffering more than they did; he is more effeminate, less firm, patient and courageous than they; in other words he is spiritually less strong. 

~ Nicolai Berdyaev 

There are only two possible forms of control: one internal and the other external; religious control and political control. They are of such a nature that when the religious barometer rises, the barometer of external [i.e., political control] falls and likewise, when the religious barometer falls, the political barometer, that is political control and tyranny, rises. That is the law of humanity, a law of history. If civilized man falls into disbelief and immorality, the way is prepared for some gigantic and colossal tyrant, universal and immense.

~ Juan Donoso Cortes

Wherever an altar is found, there civilization exists.

~ Joseph de Maistre

For contemporary [written in 1916] European societies, conquest by foreign eugenic groups has been of no significance since the last great barbarian invasions, and it no longer exists as a factor in the European social organism. But there is nothing to indicate that it cannot appear again in the future. If European societies were to model themselves on the ideal dear to the humanitarians, if they should go so far as to inhibit selection, to favor systematically the weak, the vicious, the idle, the ill adapted—the “small and humble” as they are termed by our philanthropists—at the expense of the strong, the energetic who constitute the elite, then a new conquest by new “barbarians’ would by no means be impossible.

http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/china-now-has-the-lowest-fertility-rate-the-world-18570

&gt;China began relaxing the one-child policy in November 2013 for some couples (in which one member was an only child). Given the tepid response, the policy was fully relaxed on January 1, 2016, and now everyone in China is allowed to have two children.  But many are not interested and the response has been lackluster, despite an initial burst of built up demand.  China now has the lowest fertility rate in the world—1.05 according to China’s 2016 State Statistical Bureau data and reported by Liang Jianzhang and Huang Wenzheng in a recent Caixin article.  Liang, the CEO of C-Trip, has been an ardent advocate of policy change. China has been in “below replacement fertility” (under 2.1 births per woman) since about 1990 and there is little hope of reversing this. The new normal, after thirty-five years of non-stop propaganda and exhortations to control births, is that one is enough and for some, even that is too many.

In Mao's early days, he tried to encourage huge families, as he thought that more population density would permit for an industrialized society.  Then concerns about overpopulation came up, and the One Child Policy was put in place to correct that policy.  Then under that, fertility plunged down again and the state is trying to yank fertility back up again.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8b2872/china_is_now_pushing_a_panasia_card_a_future/dx3tbxp/,vokegaf,1523325999

Like this shit isn't going anywhere by 2020, 2030, 2050 - it's the present and foreseeable future. We're laughably deluded. I'm almost past the point of caring, it's just so funny that we've voluntarily imported cultural civil war.

I don't think any civilisations have ever really done that before. I don't think it will play out well.

As for islamic extremism having anything to do with Christianity that is nonsense.  In Christianity, God judges you after you have already died.  If you do not believe then it simply does not apply because you are already dead anyway.  In islam, man judges you and punishes you while you are alive.  If you are an unbeliever or somebody that no longer believes if anything you will be treated far worse.  The two are not at all the same.

5101,"Again, you're still not getting it, you don't know that Spain and Portugal are way too different economically. Don't extrapollate what happens in Portugal to what happens in Spain. Spain's average wage is 1749€ looking at Eurostat data, not very far from Belgium or UK which are circa 2000€, meanwhile Portugal averages 925€. 

There is **nowhere** in Spain with ""high emigration"" rates **but quite the contrary, many with high immigration rates**. Unlike in Portugal (well, neither in Portugal nowadays) in Spain there aren't noticeable native emigration movements since the late 1960s. In fact even the poorest region, Extremadura, has it's fair share of immigrants. Spain is the world's 9th country by immigration.

The number of Spaniards abroad is misleading as literally 70% of Spaniards abroad are not born in Spain but have the citizenship because they had Spaniard grandparents or even older relatives, but the Spanish law allows them to have it. 

Most Spanish people by citizenship lives in Argentina, Venezuela and Cuba nowadays so this proves my point.

**Btw the Spanish population grew up a looooot from 2001 to 2012**, extreme growth I would say (**2001: 41 million inhabitants, 2012: 47 million**) about 500k immigrants left Spain in the crisis, and about 100k Spaniards born in Spain as well (100k from a total of +40M native Spaniards is a very, very low migration rate) but in 2016 and 2017 the population grew again due to new immigrants and Spaniards returning from abroad, especially in 2018 we will see a much bigger growth for Spain due to the economic performance.

Extremadura is the poorest region of Spain with an avg wage circa 1200€ , yet the average of the country by EURES is 1749 , much closer to France (2240) or Belgium and UK (both rounding 2000€) than to Portugal (925) or Greece (under 900) isn't it?

Spain does have a bigger unemployment rate but even when Brits and Germans came to work in Spain in the 2000-2010 decade, Spain's unemployment rate was rounding 10%. Spain has a massive underground economy which moves lots of jobs, lots of tax evasion and bigger wages than the real, legal ones, as by this way, you can pay less taxes and both employer and employee are more benefited. It is sad, but happens the same in Portugal, Italy and specially Greece as well. Don't believe Greeks or Portuguese earn just 900 a month lol.

The poorer regions Spain has aren't growing that much because the investment is low, so there aren't new job opportunities but just job replacements so many youths from there flee to other Spanish regions, that's why places like Extremadura or Castilla la Mancha lost population while Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Valencia or Zaragoza gained it. This is excluding immigrants of course.

Just like I said, there Spanish regions with +2100 wages on average meanwhile the poorest barely surpasses 1200. But still, Spain is a net receiver of immigrants, even these of the poorer regions receive immigrants, life in Extremadura is almost as cheap as in Poland but the wages are still significantly higher than in Poland, so that's why you are not seeing none northern European country with hundreds of thousands of Spaniards or no country where Spaniards are an important part of the immigration. Well, it does happen just in Andorra, along with French. Can't say the same about Portuguese or Italians, both making an important part of the population in Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, Switzerland...

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaniards as you see, there is only a noticeable number of Spaniards in France, yet the majority arrived there in the 60s or the early 70s.

5133,"Sorry, you seem to have misunderstood (Both me and the source).

What I meant to say in my first comment was:

1) Crimes like rapes or murders involving foreign nationals (**not** naturalized germans who immigrated here, since the statistics rightly counts them as germans), are the ones that get more publicized.

2) However, foreign nationals also make up a significantly higher percentage of perpetrators.

I'm not cherrypicking, I'm not ignoring context. The discussion was specifically about crimes like rape and other serious crimes that tend to get more publicity.

I got my data from the full report.

And we are talking about foreign nationals, not just ""refugee"" immigrants/asylum seekers. Though the report speciffically uses ""Immigrants"" only refering to asylum seekers, refugees, and similar cases.

When you look at those numbers, you'll see that foreign nationals (aka. ""non-Germans"" in the report) account for 30,47% of all crimes, violent or otherwise. 

Read it more carefully, including the footnotes.

Though I must correct, that the updated foreign national population share for 2016 is 12,14% (I went of 2015 numbers).

That makes the crime rate for foreign nationals 3,15x that of german citizens.

The real reason is a pre-euro economy based on devaluation of the currency. Once it was no longer possible for the Italian government to print extra money as they wished to balance their national economic system, that model got its legs cut away. But while that method was lost, nothing else took its place for some time, and the change is costly.  

The pre-euro economy of Italy was not compatible with the other national economies who took part in the shared currency, nor was it compatible right away with the general management of the shared currency. The other nations who gained more after adopting the euro either had: national economies already set to work without relying on devaluation, economies already in line with the management of the shared currency, or they took the most advantage from the european funds.  

Then there are also surely lots of other unresolved problems since ages, but the adoption of the shared currency didn't help either, the impact of it wasn't smooth.",,/r/europe/comments/8ayv5d/gdp_per_capita_growth_in_european_regions_since/dx3konc/,zeando,1523317574

When the tow truck comes down, they’ll work very slowly, hoping that the car owner will come out and give a bribe to not take the car away.  City employees are not well paid, and it’s cheaper to pay the bribe than the fee.

For example:

Give more power to EU parliament (e.g. legal initiatives) -&gt; PMs throw a hissy fit because they want the Council to have that power.

Have more EU-wide direct elections (for presidents etc) -&gt; countries throw a hissy fit because they don't want to give more legitimacy to EU over themselves.

Require higher majorities (in parliament and council) for bills and acts to pass -&gt; nothing ever passes and the EU becomes even more unable to react to quick situations like the migrant crisis.

Require lower majorities -&gt; people in more countries will get pissed off by the bills that pass.

5305,"Did you miss the part where I said I had nothing against America?

What I am against is America's hypocrisy where they are absolutely fine and happy to surgically modify the genitals of their baby boys but horrified at doing the same thing to baby girls. 

It's blatant hypocrisy. Because it is not how much tissue that is removed that is the problem it is the lack of consent from the person receiving the permanent surgery. The consent from a mother or father should not be sufficient because the mother or father will not be suffering the consequences if the often unnecessary surgery goes wrong. Go look up some stories of where circumcisions have gone wrong and the child was not afforded the choice so basically their parents forced them into having a permanent cosmetic surgery that carried risks all because the parents wanted his dick to look ""better"" or whatever other bogus reason and it backfired because it went wrong. So if the child was spared the knife he would have lead a normal life but instead he's got a mutilated penis.

I would not be against it if the baby said ""Yes I'd like to have a circumcision"" that would be the baby's choice as it is the baby's body. But in this world a baby isn't capable of doing that. 

So why not wait and let the baby grow up to allow them to decide for themselves whether they want surgery conducted on their genitals? 

The rest of the world thinks what Americans, Jews and Muslims do to their children's genitals to be pretty barbaric. Because a foreskin doesn't grow back. A clitoris doesn't grow back. A clitoral hood doesn't grow back. 

So don't fucking cut them off of children without their consent you bloody animals. 

It's that simple. I really don't see how you're that ignorant to not see the hypocrisy in America where they scream their heads off about FGM but very quiet about MGM because they know they do it to their own children.

America is a great country. It's well run (except their healthcare which is abysmal not in quality but in accessibility). It is fairly liberal in many things but when it comes to chopping baby dicks Americans become the most conservative people on the planet. It's pretty ridiculous... where is the freedom of a baby to choose for himself whether he wants his dick circumcised or not? Is that freedom not afforded to him? If so then why? Because that freedom is afforded elsewhere in the world which falls under children's rights. 

I've seen some ridiculous arguments and excuses some people (often Americans) use to justify child circumcision. 

Ranging from things like babies aren't human til a certain age. To parents having the right to remove any part they want from their child according to their beliefs and many other ridiculous arguments. 

It's stupid really just stupid. There is no strong argument against giving the freedom to a child to decide for himself. Baby girls have been afforded that right so it is about time baby boys are afforded the same. 

Europe: Babies have the right to bodily integrity

America: Babies have the right to bodily integrity especially girls. But as for boys and that icky foreskin eeeeewwww cut it off!

When America goes apeshit about their freedom yet somewhere along the line they screwed up because baby boys aren't afforded the freedom to remain free from genital mutilation.

I make decent money, in western company (that has nothing to do with EU), but I cry for people being forced to work longer hours in deplorable conditions for lower wages than the same people doing easier work, but being placed in a different place in european """"""union""""""

&gt; You say that there should be a minimum wage equal across all EU. Let me guess, if someone asked you and others who hold your opinion in Poland and other EE countries about federalization, you would flip your shit and start talking about your sovereignty and jurisdiction.

No, because EU federalisation would not mean the same wages everywhere. I can assure you. If people of Eastern Europe would have proposed western salaries for EU-federalisation they would agree with that.

Also Poles are the most pro-eu federalisation people in Europe, which I found strange to be honest.

&gt; Am I right? How do you think a law such as minimum wage could be enforced across all EU without any power over the government in that country?

If we live in union yes, but we don't live in it. This is, as I said an abomination of union. This is union that benefits only some of people, the greediest and the least honest one.

5509,"Speaking for US strategy the US conducted what are known as the two ""Offset Strategies"". Essentially what the US did was look at Soviet/ Warsaw Pac advantages and seek asymmetric means to nullify those advantages.

First Offset occurred in the 1950s and 1960s when the Warsaw Pact had an overwhelming advantage in conventional military power, at least as it came to Warsaw Pact armies. They (the ""commies"") had more men, tanks, artillery, etc. than NATO could hope to match. The US being the largest NATO army would have to ship all it men, tanks, and war fighting material across the Atlantic just to get to the fight. So the US decided to ""offset"" the Warsaw Pact conventional war-fighting advantage by building a massive, diverse, and flexible nuclear arsenal. We put nukes on everything and I mean everything. Strategic bombers, tactical fighters, battlefield missiles, artillery shells, recoilless rifles which would fit on a jeep, hell there was even a proposal for a nuclear hand grenade. For comparison the USSR had about 900 nuclear weapons in 1960, the United States had 25,000. [chart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/US_and_USSR_nuclear_stockpiles.svg/555px-US_and_USSR_nuclear_stockpiles.svg.png) On the battlefield these weapons would have served three purposes. 1. Target concentrations of enemy combat forces and destroy them. 2. Create terrain features which would make further advance difficult or impossible (ie use a nuke to cause a mountain slide) 3. Destroy enemy lines of communication, logistics, and troop reserves on which Soviet strategy depended. By the 1970s the combination of Soviet nuclear parity and concerns regarding the use of nuclear weapons meant the US needed a new strategy.

Enter the Second Offset of the late 1970s which started under Carter, but matured in the 1980s under Reagan. Question: How do you achieve effects similar to nuclear weapons, but without crossing the nuclear threshold? Answer: You use your technology advantage, build lots of ""smart Weapons"", and put them on everything. You build smart bombs, anti-tank missiles, digital fire controls for your tanks, even your ICBMs get more accurate (which has real implications for first-strike use). However, most of these ""smart weapons"" would be used against those Warsaw Pact reserve/ follow on troops alluded to earlier. NATO can match up man for man along the front lines (there's only so much space), but NATO doesn't have the reserves the Warsaw Pact is able to deploy. NATO strategy would have been to use its advantage in precision guided weapons and destroy these follow on troop s before they are able to deploy on the battlefield thus cutting off, isolating, and starving those Warsaw Pact units already in the fight. Essentially the same thing NATO wanted to do in the 1950s and 1960s, but could now do without having to use nuclear weapons.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8awlry/the_strengths_and_weaknesses_of_russias_military/dx2oczo/,ManhattanThenBerlin,1523288099

5519,"I anwsered to abother comment like yours so I'll copypaste: a freshly paved asphalt holds its ""elasticity"" and stickyness for a while and the structure of the asphalt they use to fill that spot in the picture is the same as the asphalt they originally paved the road with. On a hot day try walking on a road that has been paved within a couple of days. You can feel the asphalt almost bounce under your feet and it's sticky as hell. Compare that to a year old asphalt and it's rock solid. In old asphalt the bitumen has evaporated/worn off by rain/cars etc and it makes the asphalt crumble easier. So basically new asphalt has different thermal qualities than new asphalt even if they're made from the exactly same materials. Thats why fixing a fresh road holds but fixing an old road is a temporary fix.

You can also pour bitumen to the seams of the spot to strenghten the bind of the two pieces. We do construction sites that take multiple days like this and it doenst affect the wuality in a noticably negative way. The ideal situation would be to do everything in one go when the asphalt is hot but thats logistically and financially impossible.

If it's not going well they will just not work that day and claim the controlling agency prevented them from performing their work by not having the work path cleared. I think people would be surprised how often contractors sue the controlling agency(I work for a state DOT) fully knowing that they would never win and that they would just end up dropping it. Why? I'm not clear on the specifics, but something about currently being in a lawsuit prevents debtors from coming after you and allows the company to make up for it on other current jobs. Being able to show that the controlling agency didn't allow you to do your work goes more towards actually winning a suit...but less likely you're gonna receive another contract from that agency.

In the US at least, we can’t tell the contractor what means and methods to use to accomplish the work (otherwise we’d take on tort liability) so long as the contractor complies with safety regulations and the final product meets specifications. So if this happened in my city I wouldn’t have any means to say anything until the contract deadline. It probably works the same way in Europe. I imagine the project timeline was probably moved up and they weren’t able to give the owners the necessary time before towing the vehicles. This looks like the pavement was milled down to the aggregate (gravel) base course, then it opened up to traffic temporarily, and people decided to park there and probably ignored the signs about not parking in the work zone. Then the contractor had to hurry with the heavy paving equipment. Instead of being a jerk, he took extra cost upon himself to pave a neatline a safe distance away from each car and come back later.

Anyways, you might be able to go straight to the towing company which possibly is named in the contract. Or you can pick a company, and have them bill the car's owners. That's what happens if you ignore private parking signs.

Otherwise, you'd have to go through the municipality, whose best interest it is in to get rid of the car, but that sounds awfully complicated, considering the municipality has already given official warning through a sign.

Either way, if you go through the trouble of setting up a sign to warn of cars being towed, you will have set up a way of making it happen, too. I do not know what it is in practice, but it's irrelevant in this thread. What matters is that there's an easy way.

*(Just googled it and found a random [court case](https://www.123recht.net/Wie-fruehzeitig-muss-ein-voruebergehendes-Halteverbot-angekuendigt-werden-__a30535.html) where the owner had to pay the towing company directly. That, in addition to the warning sign, leads me to believe that you do not have to contact the municipality any more before having the car towed (the court case is about how early the signs have to be set up, but it mentions the owners being billed directly by the towing company - and makes it sound like common practice).

You pretend to have a moral authority over a tiny slice of a bigger cake like reddit when not even the admins of reddit, which could be said they own reddit, enforce rules beyond the simple reddiquette which is reasonable enough for a civilized discussion. So this is not about order or the community, it's about your own comfort and interests, otherwise you wouldn't even consider not asking the users. So we're back to the 15yo fighting in a IRC war.

You want to mod a non-controversial sub, go mod cats and puppies pictures. You can't pretend to not have a controversial debate in a political sub. In fact, you can't pretend to not have a controversial debate about EU and Europe and politics and social issues in real life either. There are delicate subjects that are only solved with a debate, and a debate implies arguments from all sides with conflicts of interests. Silencing a debate, aka censorship, has never yielded any results ever, it's a poor coping mechanism like burying your head in the sand and ignoring the problem. 

You want to mod, then mod, that's your job if you wan to have any authority, so do your job. Reddit has plenty of options for modding that don't imply censorship. Hell, there are bigger communities that complain less and work better than this one.

The Helsinki Final Act regards all principals as equal and obviously the self determination principle cannot be violated which is what Azerbaijan did by clearly acting against this principle including the revocation of its autonomy and prior to any declaration of independence by Karabakh I might add.

&gt; Declare their determination to respect and put into practice, each of them in its relations with all other participating States, irrespective of their political, economic or social systems as well as of their size, geographical location or level of economic development, the following principles, **which all are of primary significance**, guiding their mutual relations:

(page 4) https://www.osce.org/helsinki-final-act?download=true

The official stance of the international community in all their declarations and statements is the upholding of the self-determination principle of Nagorno Karabakh and actually this is one of the core principles (out of three) of the peace plan.

The mediators tirelessly repeat that that the self-determination principle is **not optional**.

You also are conflating the Nagorno Karabakh (NKAO under Armenian control*) with the surrounding territories. The international community authorised with overseeing the conflict unequivocally distinguishes between these two, and considers only the latter as occupied territories and obviously has never recognised the Republic of Armenia having invaded nor occupying any territories.

&gt; Whether Armenians have more history in Karabakh doesn't mean they have superior rights on Karabakh over azerbaijanis.

I agree and that is not the point I was trying to make.

Finally Azerbaijan is the entity working against the resolution of the conflict and against all the recommendations by the international community including those of the UN Security Council, UN General Secretary, EU, NATO, the OSCE Minsk Group and others. I can provide their official stance and that of Azerbaijan if you wish. The reason Azerbaijan does this is because it simply does not want to grant self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh.

Finally the peace plan involves fixing any violations of the Helsinki Final Act by the Armenian side which basically is the return of all the surrounding territories as well as right of return among others but also fixing the violations of the self-determination principle which as you know Azerbaijan is totally against and why the status quo continues.

Furthermore Azerbaijan is radically against the hardening of the ceasefire regime against the recommendation of all international entities (UN, EU, NATO etc...) which is another stumbling block in the peace plan. Again I can provide their official stance and that of Azerbaijan.

5784,"**Stop calling gypsies Roma!**

&gt;After gypsies were politically renamed ROMA in a move Romania had no say in, media and politicians of the Western European countries started a racist process of amalgamation between the two ethnicities. Although Roma gypsies are only about 5% of Romania’s population, overnight Romania became de facto the country of the Roma gypsies and Romanians started to be treated as they were all gypsies. Roma gypsies were conflated with Romanians and the word Romanian was used for any gypsy (Roma) irrespective of their real citizenship, see Leonarda case in France. Leonarda Gibrani was a young gypsy woman from Kosovo, not Romania but she was called “roumaine” (Romanian) not Kosovo gypsy. https://lemuslimpost.com/racisme-jean-vincent-place-maghreb-palestine-roms.html (original article changed)
&gt;
&gt;Most Roma gypsies in Europe are NOT Romanian citizens yet the word Roma and Romanian are used interchangeably. Anyone who said that Romanians are not Roma is labeled racist (see the case of Cyprien, French of Romanian roots, who was forced to apologize for saying that Romanians were not gypsies).
&gt;
&gt;**The racist amalgamation plays a political role and has a clear purpose.**
&gt;
&gt;The amalgamation Roma (gypsies) with Romanians also prevents discussing specific cultural features of the Roma for fear of being labeled racist, by example child marriages, removing children from school and sending them to beg and earn money for their community, etc. When a Gypsy from Romania is discriminated, he/she is Roma, when he/she breaks the law, he/she is Romanian (sic).
&gt;
&gt;In fact, the amalgamation of Roma with Romanians is very useful for all countries of the old European Union. **It was done on purpose.**",Romania,/r/europe/comments/8awaik/how_the_germans_are_changing_the_largest_roma/dx2cb0c/,ssander,1523274403

5891,"&gt; It doesn't prove anything. And I already explained why.

No, you didn't explain anything. And you certainly have not shown any proof for your claim. Here is a longer article with several links on how babies in general experience pain: http://theconversation.com/the-mystery-of-how-babies-experience-pain-88714 Still waiting for something proofing your opinion.

&gt;A very insignificant number.

First, it doesn't really matter how ""insignificant"" this number is. Every child has the right to be protected against a permanent and sometimes harmfull modification of his body. You can later be circumcised but you cannot later be uncircumcised.
Second, it doesn't seem like the number is very insignificant. Males certainly do not tend to say negative things about their penis in public. You would certainly not tell everyone or even anyone that your penis has ugly scars or that you are not feeling that much anymore. You will maybe not even realise that the reason why you need lubricants for every sexual activity is your circumcision. But in every discussion about this topic in the internet men will show up which report that they wish that they never had a circumcision or at least they wish they had a choice. 

And their rights count, too. 

Wether it is for religious or for beauty reasons: You can get your circumcision when you are old enough to have a grasp about the consequences. There is no reasons and maybe no right at all for parents to decide about this.

5913,"&gt; Transylvania was an inseparable unit

Yes and Austria-Hungary's motto was ""indivisible and inseparable"", nobody gave 2 shits about that after the war, it's not like dividing Transylvania would've been absolutely unimaginable. The supposed driving force behind the WWI borders was the creation of nation states, so drawing the lines according to demographic maps would've completely made sense.

&gt; Also, there was no territory with 99% majority

Romania inherited several major, historically important Hungarian cities that had a 90%+ Hungarian majority which are basically located on the border like Arad and Nagyvárad (Oradea). If we only talk about counties, then maybe not 90%+, but it wasn't at all unheard of for half or more of the county to have a majority like that.

&gt; These are also szekely people, which didn't identify as hungarians for a very long time. Plus the autonomy, given or not, has nothing to do with Hungary.

Then why did hundreds of thousands took up Hungarian citizenship in this decade and why are they celebrating Hungarian national holidays like March 15 even if Romania is constantly trying to sue them for it (despite how the right for that was granted 15-18 yars ago or so).

5975,"Without going back into historic rights (which is not how you explained it anyway), the point is that Azerbaijan handled the separatist issue in a very questionable way as I am explained in my comment when comparing it to say Catalonia. Nagorno Karabakh as an Armenian entity has a much older and stronger history than Catalonia even having been part of an Armenian state in the past which is not the case of Catalonia. I repeat, what has happened in Catalonia is orders of magnitude worse than what happened in Karabakh prior to the start of the war, yet not a single Catalan has been targeted in Spain. But none of this is what my point is about, simply that had Spain done the same things as Azerbaijan had done there would be BIG problems in Spain and possibly in Europe. Karabakh self determination has got decades of history prior to 1988.

&gt; But it doesn't give Armenians a right to occupy neighbouring countries territories, and ethnically cleanse all azerbaijanis.

Armenians have always lived in Karabakh and it is these Armenians which stood up against Azerbaijan with Armenia supporting them.

&gt; There's no justification of what armenians did in Karabakh.

Again, there is no justification in modern Europe to do what Azerbaijan did with its Armenian population and act against the self determination of Armenians of Karabakh.

&gt; In this situation they are a clear aggressors and international community recognises it in that way.

The international community does not see Armenia as an aggressor nor as an invader or an occupier as evidenced by the UN Security Council resolutions, the UN General Secretary position, the UN General Assembly resolution, the EU's official position, NATO's official position and of course that of the OSCE Minsk Group which is the sole organism with authority over the conflict. Their position is that Nagorno Karabakh is a separatist entity which has occupied the surrounding territories, not Nagorno Karabakh itself.

Sure, the mutual ethnic cleansing of Armenians from Azerbaijan and Azeris from Armenia and of course the surrounding territories is very wrong. However there is a peace plan to fix all of this which Azerbaijan refuses to implement.
