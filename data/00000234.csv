3,"&gt; dude, in the list you sent me, The Americans win in every case, except Munich vs New York, at least for the particulates, the stuff I was talking about (the lower the better). In any case, you compare Stuttgart with New York and New York, one of the largest, busiest and congested cities in the world, still wins.

What is going on with you? Do you have some kind of problem to read simple charts or are you a paid troll? Nürnberg has air pollution of 15 vs. 54 in NY. Stuttgart 45 vs 54. Only some fine particles are a bit more dense, because there are more diesel cars. 

And why do you still pick random cities and compare them? Are you aware of the differences? Industry? Service focused? Subways? Means of travel? 

&gt; e.g. Chicage vs Frankfurt: 2.7 millions vs 700k. Chicago has PM10=22 and PM2.5=12 while Frankfurt has PM10=27 and PM2.5=18 (source is WHO http://www.who.int/phe/health_topics/outdoorair/databases/cities/en/ - download the excel and have a look). Houston (2.3mil) is better, with PMs of 19 and 10. Los Angeles is a bad case, because of special meteo conditions there, so they get close to Frankurt at Pms 20 and 11. But remember, Los Angeles has 3.9 million people.

Dude, you are starting over. We already talked about the average of all this values you randomly pick here, whenever they fit you. The USA is 27 times as big. If you want to compare anything, add that to the calculation or get the fuck out. The size of a country does not play a role if you want to understand how much pollution a country produces per capita. And that is the only relevant measurement to give a answer to the question ""Is a country acting pro-environment?""

82,"I dunno. I've never heard the positive case for *environment-only*. Usually they just cite current limitations in the hereditarian argument and call it a day. In my opinion these really arent 'arguments against hereditarianism' per se, because the competing proposition is just assumed to be true in a very ""god of the gaps"" style (to reference old Atheist versus Theist debates). 

These debates mostly boil down to, 'you cant be totally certain with the tools at your disposal so we should assume it's all environment.' Which is obviously silly, you dont get to assume you're the default position. Science is about determining what is more or less likely based on research, because absolute proof is hard to acquire using the scientific method. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning

**Granted** these would be good arguments against instituting horrifically brutal policies, which I think suggests the motivation behind the people making them but they should be more honest

It's a lot of stonewalling the hereditarian position by saying they always need more evidence. First it was denying IQ matters, then it was denying race can be studied (you can think it's an arbitrary category, it still reflects some differences), then it was demanding the specific genes be found, then epigenetics was suggested as the real reason, now twin studies seem to be the target. 

To make matters worse: the environmental factors are becoming more nebulous and abstract to cope with a lack of explanatory power. From socioeconomic status to 'systems of oppression'

114,"&gt;I never said intelligence was just determined by climate.

You did, you said Europeans and East Asians were smarter because they experienced cold winters. But Vitruvius Pollio had his own theory, which matched his experience in the Roman Empire that hotter regions tended to be more developed. Something that you can clearly see from the [GDP map](https://brilliantmaps.com/roman-empire-gdp/) of the Roman Empire.

Btw Native Americans experienced the harshest and most volatile winters as they made their way down the North American plains. European winters aren't anything to write home about, in comparison. Thanks, Gulf Stream.

&gt;especially if you consider that many of the rulers of ancient Egypt and other Middle Eastern regions were closer to Europeans genetically than to the modern day Arabs and Africans that inhabit those regions today.

This is literally 'WE WUZ' for white people. Ancient Middle Easterners are not closer to Europeans than Middle Easterners genetically. Modern Lebanese [share more than 90% of their genetic ancestry](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/07/canaanite-bible-ancient-dna-lebanon-genetics-archaeology/) with the ancient Canaanites. Arabs did not replace the native people, they simply 'converted' them to their culture.

Also, Ancient Egyptians are not shifted towards Europeans, and especially not northern Europeans, they are shifted slightly towards Levantines (modern day Syrians and Lebanese) but still share overwhelming amounts of DNA with modern-day Egyptians. There was a migration of Middle Eastern farmers to Europe in the Neolithic era, so there is a genetic overlap between Middle Easterners and Europeans, but this is not remotely the same thing as Ancient Egyptians actually being 'European.'

Well I'd counter that these statistics disprove the need for diversity quotas. Racial discrimination must be prevented, and we can do that by striving for equality of opportunity instead of equality of outcome.

Borrowing from someone else's example here, it is illogical to think that the racial composition of neurosurgeons in a society will reflect the overall racial composition of the society. If you have X% Whites, W% Blacks, Y% East Asians and Z% Ashkenazi Jews in an overall White society, it's just mother nature determining that the proportion of neurosurgeons by race will be ≈X% Whites, ≪W% Blacks, &gt;Y% East Asians and ≫Z% Ashkenazi Jews.

He was given a one-hour miltary trial without substantial proof or defense and killed directly after, which is just as unfair and barbarian as his regime was. And this was the start of the democratic Romania unfortunately. I would have loved to see him being given a fair trial and live the remainder of his life in prison instead.

But that is not even the most important part. 

The most important part is that some old Communist partners of Ceaușescu (out of which most notably first democratic Romanian president Iliescu) became the face of the revolution because they were controlling the television. People were uninformed, happy to see Ceaușescu go and hopeful for a fresh start and couldn't really realize what was happening during the whole revolution.

If Ceaușescu (or at least his wife) hadn't been killed then, he/she/they could have served as an important witness for the Communist crimes in which the ""new democratic leaders"" took part and maybe today we would have had a ""cleaner"" political class than we have, or at least one that was not part of the old Communist nomenklatura.

Don't get me wrong, I think Iliescu's presidency, as terrible, bloody and corrupt as it was, was still a better outcome for Romania than if it had stayed with Ceaușescu and Communism. The fraudulent and propaganda-driven elections after 1989 were still better than no elections, and I believe that Romanians actually gained unimaginably much freedom after the revolution compared to before.

But that doesn't mean that Ceaușescu's killing in December 1989 was fair and good thing and that it was a ""people's revenge"" against the regime.

283,"I've already dealt with what I think are the problems with the OP's initial point, but I'm intrigued how much you seem to be reading into this.  While I suppose you could read the OP's point as a threat, I'd argue you really have to work at it to get there, and his responses to you (above and below) suggest otherwise. 

I wonder if you'd have taken the above point in the same way if it had been in the context of Northern Ireland for example. We see lots of people suggesting that we could see a resumption of violence in Northern Ireland if conditions there deteriorate, often with the suggestion that politicians would be to blame for that consequence if they fail to take the possibility into account in how they act.  Yet that generally isn't seen as a threat.

Not to mention that the general premise of the OP's point is generally seen as valid, that in a societies that lack viable peaceful political avenues to create change, they will under certain circumstances resort to violence, because people want change and there is the perception that there are no other avenues available.  Again, we've seen this brought up in a whole range of areas, from China (political repression and a lack of self determination) to Spain (independence movements clashing with the constitutional framework that would allow for change).

Suggesting that something that we know has happened before, and that we know is a risk under certain conditions is possible, isn't threatening. It is alarming (and I think the OP is wrong that the UK is in a state that is even close to justifying political violence) but it's not unreasonable to suggest that it is a logical step when no other means ways of pursuing a political aim (again, even if that is clearly not the case in the UK).",Royaume-Uni de Grande-Bretagne et d'Irlande du Nord,/r/europe/comments/8qkk82/mps_murder_was_to_be_white_jihad/e0kv5un/,ajehals,1528856047

I don't tolerate them, I hate them for their backwards values. But there's no legal recourse, you can't just deport citizens you disagree with, especially if they have no citizenship in any other country. It would also be rather unethical. This does not extend to illegal economic migrants.

&gt;So if you are at Bodensee, Sniardwy, or Bassenthwaite Lake with a friend, and you see a boat in serious distress would you cross your arms and tell your friend that these guys had it coming and you glad they are dying because most likely their death frees your nation from ""reactionary"" people?

I'd try to save them because 1. I could get in trouble for failing to render aid, and 2. presumably they didn't throw themselves in the lake just so someone could rescue them and drag them to the other side. If I were in trouble (that I didn't purposely inflict on myself), I'd expect the same from them. Do unto others, and all that. 

&gt; What does it matter that they are illegal?

Makes it much easier to get rid of them. If they were illegal agnostics/atheists with values similar to mine, I'd want them rescued, legal or illegal. Statistically, they overwhelmingly aren't like that. Like I said, I discriminate based on an ideological basis, which is not an inherent trait like race.

I'm not against taking in people from the Syrian conflict, as long as they leave when it's safe for them to return. With financial assistance if needed.

Are you truly trying to defend the imperial drug trade that was [intended to subdue a sovereign state and get its citizens addicted to opioids](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-opium-wars-the-bloody-conflicts-destroyed-imperial-china-17212)?

I honestly don't actually blame you for not knowing a lot of this, it's not taught. But it's also fact that the Irish famine was, to a large degree, intentionally exacerbated to punish the local population for not submitti to British rule.

&gt;	Back in Famine time, the same potato crop disease occurred most heavily outside Ireland in Scotland, yet there were relatively few casualties as the landowners and government ensured, for their own sakes as much as anything, that there was no mass death. 

&gt;	That was not the case in Ireland, where a very different mentality prevailed. The damned Irish were going to get what they deserved because of their attachment to Catholicism and Irish ways when they were refusing to toe the British line. 

&gt;	As Coogan painstakingly recounts, every possible effort by local organizations to feed the starving was thwarted and frustrated by a British government intent on teaching the Irish a lesson and forcing market forces on them.

In fact, in several instances [British civil servants were punished for giving food to starving Irish citizens.](https://www.irishcentral.com/news/proving-the-irish-famine-was-genocide-by-the-british-tim-pat-coogan-moves-famine-history-unto-a-new-plane-181984471-238161151)

Charles Trevelyan was one of the worst offenders. He was in charge of implementing a policy following the famine best described by him as “Protestant and Catholic will freely fall and the land will be for the survivors.” 

Another gem from this asshole: “The real evil with which we have to contend is not the physical evil of the Famine but the moral evil of the selfish, perverse and turbulent character of the people.” 

What's left, the Boer concentration camps? oook, here we go! From the British Archives;

&gt;It has been estimated that between 20,000 and 28,000 white civilians died of disease in these camps. There were also 14,154 recorded deaths of black people from disease in the camps (over one in ten of the black camp population) and such deaths were under recorded.

&gt;While the policy may have succeeded in military terms [forcing the Boers, it is believed, to surrender - thereby ending the war], it was a political disaster, earning the British a level of unpopularity on an international scale comparable to that of the USA during the Vietnam war. One contemporary critic even used the term 'holocaust'. Public criticism was, however, centred on the white camps; those for Africans, where provision was usually even poorer, were hardly mentioned in the debate.

Even British politicians at the time were calling it ""barbaric.""

From Emily Hobson, a British woman who visited the camps herself; 

&gt;I call this camp system a wholesale cruelty … To keep these Camps going is murder to the children...

364,"&gt;It's Aritcle 3 that gives only credible research institutions the right to mine data, the definition of which is up to the government

I suppose that this probably impacts product recommendations.

That may or may not be desirable, but if your competitor has an established market abroad and has built a recommendation engine based on data there, then it's going to be hard to compete with them, I'd think.

To put this in terms that might resonate with French cultural conservatives irritated about American influence, let's take gog.com and Steam.  Both are online video game retailers.  Steam is American, and GOG is Polish.  Now, if GOG can't mine what people like and Steam can, two things are likely to happen:

* European companies like GOG will enter the market unable to do recommendations and will have to compete against companies that are putting what the customer more-or-less wants in front of him constantly.

* When American companies enter the European market, they will bring in recommendation engines trained on American consumers (or French Canadian or whatever), whom it is legal to mine.  Computers will push content that reflects American public preference and culture, because that is where the training data will come from.  Same thing for music.  Same thing for movies on Netflix and whatnot.  Same thing for books.  Same for products on Amazon in general.  Meanwhile, the preferences of the *French* consumer will be restricted from being used to influence recommendations, as Article 3 use will be commercial, so recommendation AIs in vendors across the board will be actively stomping out French culture and replacing it with American.

Second, mandating such filters makes it nearly impossible for new players to enter the scene. Want to host a forum? Compete with Facebook? Launch a new video site? A blog where people could leave replies? All of those would require you to set up filters as well, which increases the capital and other resources required to become a player.

«The jury heard that Renshaw and his fellow defendants regarded the government as **“race traitors”** and had been preparing for a war against Jews, gay people, ethnic minorities and anyone not following their violent ideology.»


«He explained his plan was then to take some people hostage in a pub and when the police arrived he would demand to speak to DC Victoria Henderson [a police officer who interviewed him].

“When the officer arrived, **he would kill her**. Renshaw said that after he had killed Ms Henderson he would then **commit ‘suicide by cop’** by pretending to have a suicide vest on.”»


«Prosecutors said the would-be terrorist intended to **make a video stating that the attack was carried out in the name of National Action** that would be released after his death»

«**Christopher Lythgoe**, 32, of Warrington, denies giving Renshaw permission to murder the West Lancashire MP on behalf of National Action at the pub meeting.

He allegedly **advised Renshaw to destroy all of his electrical equipment before the attack, so the police could not link him to his neo-Nazi allies, then told him: “Don’t f*** it up.**”»


«**Mr Lythgoe** stands accused of leading the northwest faction of National Action after the group’s prohibition, when it split into several factions that operated under aliases to evade authorities.

On Tuesday the prosecution presented emails he allegedly sent using the encrypted Tutanota service **organising meet-ups, combat training, recruitment and issuing instructions on secure communications**.»


«On a USB stick found at Mr Hankinson’s home, police found a text reading: “**We are racial national socialists, the nation is our blood … we must split the people into two groups, the racially loyal nationalists and the traitors. This must be done.”**»

That's pretty much the problem with all of Scandinavia in this historic period. The [Jelling stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelling_stones) mentions that Harald Bluetooth won all of Denmark and Norway, what's considered Norway is especially a topic for debate. Though Norway in this case is probably only the southern parts with access to Skagerrak Sea.

528,"Subsidiary protection is the only status that would have an immigrant who is *not* a refugee qualify for asylum. If you do not qualify for subsidiary protection, it doesn't matter what the legal situation in the home country is.

That does not mean the person will always be *extradited*, meaning explicitly handed over to the authorities; instead, the person may simply be put on a plane and deported. Of course, it is likely they will just get caught as they enter their home country's airport, but at this point it is no longer Europe's problem, to put it bluntly. Depending on the decision by the local agency, the deportee may also be escorted all the way by enforcement officers, especially if they are considered dangerous (which is possible if they really did commit a serious crime).

The details will simply depend lot on the country doing the deportation, and the agencies involved -- the tricky thing here is how it's essentially two different/separate processes, and the regulations do not tie into each other, leaving room for interpretation as long as the member state does not violate any parts of either.

Not that violations do not still occur, of course. Germany has in the past deported a number of immigrants into countries only to have the deportees end up in a torture chamber, such as when Germany and Syria entered into a repatriation agreement in 2009. There was [a prominent case from 2010](http://www.taz.de/!5139676/) where even ordinary deportees who had committed no crime got snatched up by Syrian police and tortured solely for ""making Syria look bad"" by requesting asylum.

Fates to keep in mind when debating topics such as this one.

The point I'm trying to get across is that, there is no easy way to handle disputed territories in mapmaking, and that mapmakers will inevitably need to adapt to their ""target audience"". This is nothing new, and has been around since forever.

625,"Kind of an unrelated question but I understand that you are being sincere.

Keep in mind that I’m explaining this from my own, subjective point of view. This is not a strictly factual, scientific analysis. 

Earlier this morning I sat on a subway train into Stockholm’s old town. I sat beside 5 children and 2 adults, all of them dark-skinned and belonging to the same group. The children were loud, unruly and generally unaware of what Swedish cultural norms dictate behaviour in public space is supposed to look like. The two adults however, acted according to all those norms, they were quiet and humble (altough easygoing). They left their seat for elderly and projected an aura of trust. They did what they could to calm these children down, but nothing worked. They acted disrespectfully and defiantly.

Most of these kids will grow out of this behaviour and become like their caretakers.


1 or 2 of them won’t.

Those two kids are the consequences of many problems, the fact that they are strangers to the cultural norms of the country they were *born* in, results in them either integrating by pure luck and positive connections (which is hard to aquire when you live in areas where 90% of the population aren’t ethnic Swedes), or failing to develop a Swedish identity. And when an angsty teenager can’t find anything positive to identify with, crime and radicalism flourish.


This is a problem the Swedish people and it’s government have been trying to fix for the past years, but the problem is unfathomably complicated and the methods are costly not only from a financial view but also from a spiritual one. People quickly forget all the good they’ve done for the world when they read the news and wish it back. This is why SD (Sweden Democrats) has started to grow immensely the past years. This is a shame, since ideally we shouldn’t have to resort to such means in the first place. But since it’s a proportional system, reasonable middleground between the moderates (conservative liberals) and the more populist anti-immigration party will result in a favourable result for most, altough I fear the people who deserve a solution to this problem the most (the non-problematic 2nd gen immigrants) will get burned for no justified reason. I have never felt unsafe on the streets of Stockholm, annoyed maybe, but never unsafe. I live quite close to a home for the recently arrived, there’s a family with a little girl who’ve lived there for the past year. Sometimes I see her laughing and playing in the frontyard on my way to town, and everytime I do I’m filled with pride and renewed optimism that closing our eyes to suffering like many here seems to promote is what makes us no better than the fools who caused the crisis in the first place. That doesn’t neccessarily mean that we **have to** take in every single person who knock on our borders, but that we can work harder on a solution that satisfies everyone.

TLDR: Crime is a growing problem due to the situation some 2nd generation immigrants are put into when they grow up without a way to identify with Swedish cultural norms. These kids belong to a criminal minority whom cause the majority of the damage. Non-ethnic Swedes are piece by piece stigmatised which in turn accelerates the cycle.",Jarl Karl med Karlahår,/r/europe/comments/8qcful/italian_minister_declares_victory_as_spain/e0jwb7d/,Ymirwantshugs,1528823882

This is a completely different thing and I completely agree with you, historical revisionism is wrong. However, is this historical revisionism a majority opinion or just a movement inside a party? Because, in Romania, we have PLENTY of historical revisionists but they're mostly confined to dusty old people in shitty fascist parties, like the equivalent of your Golden Dawn.

&gt; There's no court where we can sue them for trying to rewrite history this way

I'm finding it VERY hard to believe that historical revisionism is a majority opinion in Macedonia either, but please convince me you are correct, I'm sure you can find a couple of articles to prove your claims.

&gt; We don't have irredentism towards FYROM.

That's good to know but again, it's a little hard to believe - but I believe you nonetheless. Golden Dawn has plenty of irredentist policies and I'm afraid they don't like Macedonians too much.

672,"&gt; mid-brick huts in Sudan

I've been to several Sub-Saharan African countries and in many cases you are right about the 'huts'. But you may be surprised to hear that many actually have access to the internet (courtesy of, among others, Bill Gates, even if you can argue it wasn't purely altruistic) and in any case well-placed campaigns could spread information more effective than you would think. The problem is that these countries actually like the emigration because many of them send remissions back to their families.

Honestly for most Sub-Saharan Africans objectively life standards have been improving the last 30 years across the board. The side effect is that many now get access to media in which they can see glimpses of life elsewhere. Combine that with a youth bulge, contact with relatives already living in Europe and not much going on for employment, and you have a strong pull factor. I've met many young people that think they could become a professional football player like many people with African roots in Western European football clubs. I honestly understand them, but that does not mean I think we should just accept them.

Pekka Seppänen is a Finnish serial killer who killed several people by drowning and causing boat accidents.

Pekka later killed him by drowning him in his shore and avoided charges as usual... The victim's sister discussed about the killing on the internet mentioning Pekka, and Pekka successfully pressed defamation charges and she had to pay 3000€.

If you mean those during Colectiv and in February, you mean illegally without permit.                        
The recent protests against abuse were too announced via Facebook and with authorisation to do it. Big difference in conducting, especially since it was humongous.

*And before anyone else says it, other countries ask you for permits to authorise protests, so if a xenophile needs clarification, there it is: other countries in the West require permit to authoritise protests.* 

&gt;at that time PSD was saying that Soros paid everyone and this time his party actually paid them

It wasn't PSD saying it more than being obvious on itself. Soros [pays](https://youtu.be/N8CBBn0YxQA?t=28s) a lot of NGOs that operate in Romania - that's not a secret nor untrue. Their organisation is structured like paramilitaries. A lot of operatives (or NGOers), tied to NGOs &amp; Open Foundation money injections, are paid by Soros. There's a payer (Soros) and receivers (NGOs and the NGOers). 

Saying Soros paid over tens of thousands of people is incorrect, sure.                                      
It's not incorrect to say, however, that Soros pays NGOers, agitators, and ”activists” to convince those tens of thousands to organise and protest. Moreover, those tens of thousands didn't knew those protests were illegal since those that agitated for them didn't bothered to follow the law. Speaks volume.

&gt;also the other protest did not have a stage were lies were told pure propaganda style

752,"Firstly, there was a serious lack of workforce. That was due to war losses, mass fleeing to the West, deportations etc. What is more, due to Stalinist repressions, Estonia and Latvia missed the 1950s-1960s baby boom rest of Europe experienced.

The Baltics were border territories, so they always had a significant Soviet army presence. That, in turn, brought non-military people as well (family members, builders etc). 

Estonia is near St. Petersburg (Leningrad at the time), so it served as a comfortable transit region and supplier, which increased demand for workforce even more.

Latvia had an important city and major port Riga, with also direct railway connection to Moscow. So they had kinda the same thing with Moscow.

There are some other commonly named factors, like Baltics being more developed than Russian provinces, so even with communist economy, that kinda left an impression; and Moscow's aim to mix populations in order to suppress nationalism. 

Meanwhile, Lithuania had a longer guerilla war with USSR and they kinda gave a signal that Russians were not welcome there.

758,"I did a longer post about it. But I think it comes down to who's able to write history.

Like most people forget that whole build up to the Jew hate of the time. Nationalism was on the rise, and Jews were seen as not part of the state the lived in, but an outside group living within the borders. Jews would come into cities, all collect around each other, then dominate the financial world. Through this they would be able to take over industries and basically keep all the money earned within their local Jew economies, while lending out money. This made them very rich, which they'd then use to influence politicians to make favorable decisions and laws for the Jewish people. This pissed off pretty much everyone, because they saw a group of ""outsiders"" corrupting governments for their own personal gains over the greater culture/state. 

Hence the rise of anti-semetism. Almost universally everyone began blaming the Jews for all the problems, under the idea that the Jews don't give a damn about the country they are in, only other Jews. So countries started hating them and wanting them gone. Germany was the first to take really really extreme measures. 

After the war and the whole Final Solution came to light, the rest of the world wanted to distance themselves as much as possible from their anti-semitism and part of the culture that lead to the atrocities, so they just threw everything right onto the Germans and then played dumb. What could the Germans do? They lost, and had no say in this writing of history. 

I think something similar happened with Japan.... On one hand, yeah there is that cultural disconnect. The US was the last standing person out of the whole conflict and were now on the rise as a super power, so they had the last say in everything. With Europe we have a direct history... So what happened on that front can't really be brushed under the rug. Too many connections... But with Japan? Culturally completely removed from the West. They were just these other people over the Pacific. 

Then the USA did A LOT of absolutely awful things to the Japanese... Like the fire bombings were absolutely brutal, and not to mention the whole nuclear devastation we brought onto them. The USA now being the new superpower and looking like the good guys everywhere, really wanted to brush their atrocities under the rug... So they sort of tacitly agreed to not make a big stink about what happened in Japan to avoid putting the things that they did also under the microscope of criticism. A sort of, ""Listen, you don't spend too much time dwelling on what we did, and we won't dwell too much on what you did. We have Germany by the balls right now, and we both can benefit if we just sort of forget about this whole thing as much as possible.""",,/r/europe/comments/8qh1kg/congratulations_scandinavia_the_worlds_nicest/e0jntmy/,chadbarrett,1528816779

893,"Most EU countries have more political influence then in poland:

Spain

In Spain, judges are selected by the General Council of the Judiciary, roughly the counterpart of Poland’s KRS. The council is headed by the president of the country’s Supreme Court, and its remaining 20 members are selected by the parliament by a three-fifths majority from among candidates recommended by the Electoral Commission operating out of the Supreme Court.

The Spanish system is close to the model urged by Poland’s ruling conservatives.

Germany

The five most important judicial institutions in Germany are the Federal Court of Justice, the Federal Labour Court, the Federal Social Court, the Federal Fiscal Court, and the Federal Administrative Court. They are roughly equivalent to Poland’s Supreme Court and Supreme Administrative Court. Under the German constitution, candidates for judges on these courts are named by the federal minister of justice (equivalent to Poland’s Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro) and by a 32-member recruitment commission (of which 16 members are selected by the parliament and the other 16 by the justice ministers of the country’s individual states).

The same commission selects judges for the five courts. The appointments are subject to approval by the German federal government. Once such approval is granted, the country’s president formally appoints a judge.

All this goes to show that judges in Germany are selected by politicians.

France

What about France, a country whose presidents, both the current one and his predecessor, have been known to rebuke Polish politicians over rule-of-law issues? It turns out that in that country too, politicians have a significant influence on the selection of judges.

Judicial appointments in France are determined by the country’s High Council of the Judiciary. This is composed of 12 members, but given the specific features of the French system of government, the nation’s president has the majority of votes in the council. How so?

The president of France is himself part of the High Council of the Judiciary, and he also appoints three of its members. The other members are: the heads of the National Assembly and the Senate (both usually come from political parties allied with the head of state); the justice minister (usually politically close to the president); a prosecutor; a representative of the country’s constitutional court; and five judges. This inevitably means that the president -- a politician -- has the majority of votes in the High Council of the Judiciary.

Netherlands

The European Commission’s Timmermans, a Dutchman, has often hit out at Poland, suggesting it disrespected European standards. He has also lambasted the government in Warsaw over judicial reforms.

In Timmermans’ native Netherlands, judges are appointed by royal decree. This takes place at the request of the justice minister. Candidates are named by the country’s Council for the Judiciary, which is half composed of judges selected by members of the judicial community. If there are two candidates for one spot, the justice minister makes the final choice.

This brief overview shows the extent to which democratically elected politicians have a say in the process of selecting judges. Their influence varies from one EU member state to another.",,/r/europe/comments/8q23ge/officials_poland_done_making_concessions_in/e0jgdbl/,Culaio,1528809664

No we should not. This would push them towards isolation and crime. Embracing people regardless of their backgrounds and showing them the values we have here is the right way to go. Of course some losers will do shit, this should not cause any step back.

&gt; You had one or two communist terrorists

I gave you a fucking link, why don't you look and see how many attacks they did? It's not ""one or two"", RAF terrorized Germany more than ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Hamas combined.

&gt;  but fact is 90% of worlds terrorism is done by one type of religion. 

Back then it wasn't. Organizations like RAF, FARC, IRA, ETA, PKK were way more dangerous than the Islamic ones (which did not even exist back then).

&gt;  This isn't a coincidence. It's a huge problem with their religious scripts and teachings. 

So why weren't Muslims terrorising here and there in 1960s? The script did not change. It's the same book. Use your fucking brain.

&gt;  Look at Bosnia. It was one of the most moderate developed Muslim societies in the world. Where for a large portion of the population drinking alcohol or eating pork wasn't such a big deal. But then came funding from saudi arabia and wahabism and look at that suddenly we have extremist in bosnia.

Then why do you say it's the script only? It's the world conjuncture and international politics that cause this kind of shit to take place. The script is not specifically worse than Torah or Bible. 

&gt; The Muslims community has a huge problem and instead of fixing it we're all ignoring it and sweeping it under the rug.

Acknowledging the problem is one thing, portraying the entire community as murderers is another thing. You did the latter, which is why you are called a right-wing nutjob in the first place. No one denies the existence of the problem. But if you think you can take advantage of the situation and push some nationalistic agenda,  you are wrong.

910,"As a fellow [~~Balt~~ Baltic](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8qb0ne/estonia_one_of_the_best_in_the_eu_at_combating/e0jbarr/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=europe), I love that we counter Russian propaganda so well. But I see it as a failure when we do it with our own propaganda.

Take my country, Lithuania, for example. We used to have [an atomic power plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignalina_Nuclear_Power_Plant) (yes, just one - we're not France), which was same make as **THE one** in Chernobyl. It was known by Lithuanians as safe, cheap, and clean means of power production. Not to mention, it was a sort of national pride given that the Latvians and Estonians didn't have one (sorry, fellow Baltics). And within good reason, even the prefabricated second generation nuclear reactors were and still are very, very safe. 

Now there is a new [Astravets power plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarusian_nuclear_power_plant) being built near our capital Vilnius. And everyone is very seriously freaking out about it. The news outlets make it a national discussion whenever there is even the tiniest incident at the construction site. Yes - a construction incident, not even an operational one. 

And I won't get into details on how operational incidents at a NPP are similar to those in aviation - they do happen often, an most of the time it's called an incident because there is a paperwork procedure to be had. Only a very fringe minority of aircraft incidents are what the general public would think when they hear ""aviation incident"". Same with nuclear power plans. Someone fell off a ladder. That's what most incidents are, it's no Chernobyl.

Now, back on topic. Living in Vilnius, we get news every other week how something is terribly wrong in Astravets, and the moment this new, modern and safe power plant goes online, we better have our fallout vaults ready. The hysteria is absolutely insane. Ask around, and 5 out of 10 people will tell you how the plant is being built on the border so as to somehow minimize the fallout on Belarussia when this ""Chernobyl"" happens. Would we still have our Ignalina plant, no matter that it had relatively outdated prefabricated soviet reactors, we'd be all so pleased with how safe it was.

But why would someone who isn't biased and knows this is propaganda care? Well, there's a simple reason. So long as the public is frightened, we won't buy the cheap electricity that is produced right on our border. We have a beautiful and very clever [pumped storage power plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruonis_Pumped_Storage_Plant) in Kaunas which can pump up and accumulate water in it's upper tank during the night when nuclear electricity is cheaper (can't really stop a reactor every night), and then run the water throguh a generator during peak hours. The Kruonis PSP can generate up to 900 MW of power for 12 hours straight during the day. Which means that Lithuania is primed for buying up cheap nuclear power during the night time and powering our grid during the day for a fraction of the cost. The Astravets nuclear power plant is an amazing opportunity for cheap, clean and safe electricity in Lithuania. With the tremendous added bonus of not having to deal with nuclear waste. And yet, there are very real plans for boycotting its power, because our people would generally like that.

What a detour this was. Either way, what I meant to say is that counter-propaganda is also bad. And it has a very real effect on our lives in the Baltics.",,/r/europe/comments/8qb0ne/estonia_one_of_the_best_in_the_eu_at_combating/e0jaq3l/,[deleted],1528802105

2. ALDE as a party is divided on this issue due to article 11 &amp; 13. But they support this bill as it's a pretty decent bill. However both their members on LAC are a tossup so they are counted into approve side.
3. Same goes for the opposition many are pro this legislation but against it due to the article 11 &amp; 13.
4. One ALDE member on LAC is being lobbied by people and organisations to vote against.

982,"The thing is that liberalism is encompasses such a hopelessly broad spectrum of politically ideas that all can really be said about it is that it is, and has been for some time, at the centre of politics, rather than leaning to any significant extent to the left or right. 'Conservative' isn't the inverse of liberalism, its the same side of the same coin. Its just the conservatives tend towards classical liberalism, and """"""left"""""" liberals tend towards social liberalism. Liberalism in this context is an ideology that aims to create a representative democratic government under a constitution (a parliament), who's purpose is to protect civil rights under law, and in order to do so maintain some degree of economic regulation, but overall support a free market economy (I'm no expert, but thats a quick summary of my understanding of the ideology). This is something supported by both ""conservatives"" and ""liberals"" (again, both of which are actually Liberals). Its just that ""conservatives"" advocate for less regulation than Social Liberals, while SocLibs have a different understanding of what constitutes civil rights. However, to both, property rights and the free market is essential.   
Anyway, the point I'd really really like to make is that you shouldn't tell these people not to call themselves 'Liberal,' you should just acknowledge that Liberalism no longer representative of the world you want to see (and that liberalism for some time hasn't been the be\-all, end\-all of leftism, nor indeed has it been on the whole of it any more than vaguely left at its fringes), and look for new alternatives.

1092,"No, that's not how it works. I'll explain. (I've been in a legislature and I've worked with copyright law for five years now, but I'm not a lawyer.) 
 
The wording ""may"" means that it's entirely up to the member states to either allow or ban it, make a limitation or exception. A member state is entirely free to simply ban the use of copyrighted material for caricature, parody or pastiche. That was the case in the UK up until 2014 - it was de facto illegal. After the reform, it became explicitly legal to do parody in the UK. This doesn't mean that parody of copyrighted material didn't exist, it just meant that it was actually a copyright infringement was illegal. This is the case in many other European countries. 

The current draft directive has the objective to *harmonize* those exceptions laid out in the InfoSoc directive of 2001. Those exceptions do not mean that if you're using a film for educational purposes that you're allowed to do it - no, it just means that the nation state is allowed to make an exception allowing you to do it.

In terms of (a) there will be a new mandatory exception, which is in article 4. That exception will be mandatory and is outlined in article 4. This article is for digital use of works for the purpose of illustration for teaching but it also lays down where this exception takes place: *""takes place on the premises of an educational establishment, or in any other venue where the teaching activity takes place under the responsibility of the educational establishment, or through a secure electronic environment network accessible only by the educational establishment's pupils or students and teaching staff;""*

So, the exception for illustration for teaching will not help with article 11, but instead this exception of digital uses for illustration for teaching will also have to apply to 11. Making it much more layered. 

Again with (c) - they are allowed to make an exception - but they don't have to. The article 11 will make it necessary for the member states to give press publisher's the right to 'obtain fair an proportional remuneration' for their 'press publishing'. This doesn't only cover news - this covers all manner of sins that's in a press publication: opinion pieces, stories, news, comics, pictures, whatever. The whole publication is what they will get an explicit right to get remuneration. 

Notice this: 

&gt; (c) **reproduction _by the press_**, communication to the public ...  

This doesn't mean with the new right that YOU are allowed to circulate the news on a google platform or twitter but it is the _press_ that has the right to reproduce what you say. **This isn't an exception for the user, but for the reporter to be able to report on things.**

Article 11 and 13 will make new rights to publishers, not authors. The exceptions you listed above will not affect the optional exceptions that member states may or may not produce.

No, but they were morally inferior because they probably weren't fond of Jews, atheists, gays, etc.

&gt;The Romans were arguably less racist than the US are nowadays. Unless I've been seriously misinformed, they cared whether or not you're a citizen, not whether or not you're European-white.

Nobody except Americans have this white-black dichotomy. The Romans were Mediterraneans who looked down on all other peoples. North Africans are also Mediterraneans, as are the Greeks, who they got a good portion of their culture from. And you can easily look up Greek views on the Barbarians in the North, whom they considered mentally inferior. A stereotype very much shared by the Romans, as can be seen in their biased writings on the Germanic peoples.

But all that aside, you seem to  be saying that being a slavery-based expansionist, authoritarian military empire is somehow less bad than rather mild forms of racism. That's ridiculous. As bad as even Jim Crow laws in the US were, that pales in comparative evil to the absolute subjugation of a majority of the population in the Roman Empire, their war-lust, and many other despicable aspects.

Pay an extra [$2 per device](http://x265.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/HEVC-Advance-Content-Royalties.png) for codec licensing (plus more for streams, and lawyer fees, and a bunch of other overhead), and have no open source codecs, and stifled innovation in the codec space, and next to no ability for startups to compete against established players with huge patent pools.
2. Google owns a few patents they're going to make no money off of, which makes you feel bad because patents are bad. Everyone runs AV1/AV2/whatever and nobody has to care about video compression patents as long as they don't try to abuse patents themselves. Anyone can feel free to innovate in the video compression space. Open source codecs are legally licensed everywhere.

Which world do you prefer? Yes, ""3. Software patents are illegal"" is the better option, but unless you have a magic wand to make that happen, I'm going to go with 2 for the time being.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/8q9bw3/polish_inventor_says_google_is_patenting_work_he/e0j46y6/,marcan42,1528788250

1264,"I find it applaudable that you're able to express that you agree with me at least on the matter that there are problems. I've met some swedes who completely refuse to even discuss these matters. Personally I think they fear of being labelled since it can result of them being fired from their jobs even or so I've heard.

I think you should see things from my perspective. I live in Finland but I have some relatives living in Sweden. I visit Sweden maybe at most two times a year and every year since 2010 things have been getting crazier there from what I've seen and heard while being there. Past few years the change has been shocking. My Swedish friends have also started to talk about voting Sweden Democrats in fall elections which I find little bit worrying.

When I wrote that Sweden is a third-world coutry I very specifically referred in this context to general behaviour of certain demographic of people, stagnation of Sweden's HDI value in U.N. reports &amp; HDI forecasts for Sweden, and few other things (e.g. IIRC almost 20% of the government's budget is spent on immigrants and most of that money is borrowed from the market so that the welfare system can run). These are all visible metrics we can look at and discuss about.

Then there are these two kinds of people who behave in non-Swedish manner which is straight out of a third-world countries. First people are these people who live in Sweden but speak little to no swedish language. They also tend to not follow Swedish customs &amp; laws. They don't have any respect for Sweden's interesting culture and event-rich history. They also have no Swedish identity and no intention to integrate into Swedish society. And then there are these native swedes who have an extreme reactions to various issues.

I think you cannot honestly argue that increase of vandalism like burning cars, breaking car windows, [throwing explosives like hand-grenades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_grenade_attacks_in_Sweden), people being [stabbed at IKEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_IKEA_stabbing_attack) and so on during last ten or so years is first-world activity which is part of the first-world Sweden. It isn't normal that synagogues have faced [arson attemps](https://expo.se/nyheter/2017/12/h%C3%A4r-%C3%A4r-de-anh%C3%A5llna-f%C3%B6r-attacken-i-g%C3%B6teborg) and [explosive attacks](https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=493&amp;artikel=5289458). It also isn't normal that asylum centres and mosques have been attempted to arson several times these past years as well in retaliation.

There have been several riots over the country like the ones at Rinkeby. One of the most stunning ones was Malmö anti-Israel riots in 2009 where over 100 people were detained because of a Tennis match. There have been serious harrassment of women at We Are Sthlm youth festival also.

There are large amounts of general social unrest in Sweden no matter how you look at it. These are part of a growing and very worrying trend in Sweden. A lot of economic immigrants have arrived to Sweden at pace where you've been unable to integrate them to your society. And when you import people and culture from third-world countries you now face transformation of Sweden where those third-world values are part of the everyday life there.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/8q7ogo/number_of_skyscrapers_in_each_european_country/e0j07tv/,Kuronuma,1528781435
1265,"I'll address the points that have little to no interest first and leave what actually matters to the end:

&gt;So in short, Trump hasn't changed any of these, merely complained at various times about them, and you've readily read into that that he supports policies that differ?

Nope. In short, that was Obama's legacy. Period. I mentioned those things are the consequence of Obama's approach. They were all true the day before Trump was elected President, so just imagine your ead it there. What Trump might or might not do about them is completely immaterial. 



&gt; No, I'm just profoundly disappointed that the sales tactics worked as well as they did. I'd had a higher opinion of the electorate.

This is what half of the country, or rather the partisan fanatics of the other half of the country, kept saying between '08 and '16. It means nothing except ""I'm a partisan fanatic"". It's what you mean now that you write it, it's what it meant when it was written when Obama was president. It's just people like you, who write that sort of stuff, aren't able to be aware of that. 

Do you have a point? Sure - and you'll be happy I agree with you. More interesting here: did they have a point? I suspect you believe they don't. And yet, if we're looking at sales tactics, the past President was elected on the basis of vaguely esoteric speeches about ""hope and change"", and utterly bizarre, messianic, cray cray rambles about, and let me quote this ipsis verbis, "" this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal; this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last, best hope on Earth"" [the moment being him being a candidate for President, like dozens of guys before him]. For all Trump's faults, he doesn't use this sort of lunatic imagery to this point of hyperbolical frenzy. Or that was elected talking about ""one American, no red and blue"" and being ""the great uniter"" and after being elected literally calling the other party ""the enemy"". Not ""our opponents"", not ""the opposition"", but ""our enemies"". Or how Joe Biden accused the Republican candidate of, let me quote this too, ""He is going to put y'all back in chains"" to an audience of African-Americans. 

Was this kind of stuff unsavoury? Pathetic? Ridiculous? Debased pitching? Sure - just like Trump's. 

(cue you shrieking about ""bothsiderism"", ironically just like Trump partisans do if I tell them Trump's campaign rhetoric was no better than Obama)


&gt;He's no social conservative. Trump has Mike Pence as VP specifically because Trump has minimal social conservative appeal and has to somehow try to fill that gaping hole.


That's simply not how any of this works. Go ask any pro-life activist in the country what they think about Trump in terms of public policy. Well, or read them: 
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-is-proving-to-be-the-most-fearlessly-pro-life-president-in-history/2018/05/23/c72f2886-5e8a-11e8-a4a4-c070ef53f315_story.html?utm_term=.56fce7147d0c

http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-most-pro-life-president-ever-says-anti-abortion-group-president-940193

Let me quote this part:

**&gt;An anti-abortion group that discouraged people from voting for Donald Trump has done a complete U-turn, now lauding him as “the most pro-life president.”*

Was Trump's campaign rhetoric particularly pro-life? Not really. To the point some important groups never supported him. 

And yet, his policy has been bazillions orders of magnitute better than every Republican president since maybe Eisenhower, from a pro-life perspective. 

Okay, let's put these two together because I think this is a great opportunity to explain to you where you're missing the point:


&gt;Fiscal conservative? Okay, what did Trump do that was fiscally-conservative that was out-of-line with the standard Republican line?

&gt;If you mean ""there is a difference between the Democratic Party and Republican Party position on the specific point of Iran"", sure, no dispute. If you mean that Trump is in any way a variable other than being Republican, then no.

Is Trump actual policy in line with Republican candidates normal rhetoric? Sure. 

But that means Trump isn't  governing, in terms of policy, like a normal Republican because there has always been a great disconnect between Republican campaign rhetoric and Republican policy in the WH (which is also true for Democrats). 

Was Trump's decision to end the Iran deal in line with what other Republicans were *saying*? Sure. 

Was Trump's decision to move the embassy to Israel in line with what other Republican candidates were *saying*? Sure. In fact, it was in line with the campaign rhetoric of every single presidential candidate, from either party, in decades. And yet, only Trump did it. 

Is there any reaosn to believe any other Republican president would actually end the Iran deal? Nope. Just like no other Republican president would have moved the embassy to Israel. 

Do you get it?

Another example. You ask ""Okay, what did Trump do that was fiscally-conservative that was out-of-line with the standard Republican line?""

Nothing. And that's exactly the difference - the only Republican president about you can say that, all the way back to the 50s, is Reagan and even him to a lesser extent. 

Heck, the last Republican president was elected on a fiscally conservative platform, way more than Trump, and yet when he got in office his accomplishments were:
* anentirely new entitlement program, the first and only President since Lyndon Johnson to do it
* an explosion in discretionary spending with pork-laden stuff like the Farm Bill, the Energy Bill, the Highway Bill. To quote from wikipedia ""discretionary domestic spending by 62 percent, Medicare spending by 131 percent, social security by 51 percent, and income security spending by 130 percent"".
* left the corporate tax rate, the stupidest tax in existence, untouched, and instead promoted a temporary tax cut that obviously would only become definitive to the middle and upper middle class, which already were the most undertaxed Americans (reason why the US has the most progressive taxation system in the developed world). 
* increased the regulatory framework and mechanims at a pace never seen since probably Roosevelt. [On an article titled Bush's Regulatory Kissoff - Obama's assertions to the contrary, the 43rd president was the biggest regulator since Nixon](http://reason.com/archives/2008/12/10/bushs-regulatory-kiss-off) you can read stuff like 

 &gt;In eight years, Bush increased the federal government's regulatory staff by 91,196 employees. Clinton cut it by 969.
-signed into law the No Child Left Behind Act, probably the most anti-conservative law coming out of DC in decades

And this not even mentioning the absurdly expensive war policy, or how he nominated freaking pro-choice Harried Miers to the Supreme Court (you won't find her there because both party senators opposed her). 

Bush 43 was easily the most left-wing POTUS, in terms of actual domestic policy implemented, not rhetoric, since 1980 (which ties up with the ""Democrats are the same I mentioned above"", Clinton and Obama governed wlel to the right of their campaign rhetoric, especially the first). 
 
His father? Google ""Read my lips, no more taxes"". He literally entered history for violating his campaign pledge on fiscal policy. 

So when you say ""well, Trump's policies are no different than the typical Republican line"" you're, albeit uninentionally, admitting Trump is not a normal Republican.

And I don't think people on your side of the aisle are aware of this, but visit conservative sites, read conservative magazines and so on and you'll see that ""when it comes to actual policy, Trump is even more conservative than Reagan"" is already the dominant view, ont he way to be consensual, and these were people who were highly suspicious of Trump, exactly because of policy (Trump hardcore supporters aren't exactly the type of people who voted for Cruz or Rubio in the primary).

I don't think you will ever be able to understand my comment, but I'll try to explain: even though Trump's views on immigration are far less restrictive than the current Germany ones, or any mainstream views in Germany (this is factual, Trump is willing to give legal residencen and a path to citizenship to millions of illegal economic migrants, something no mainstream European politician would even come close to defend), Germans believe the opposite. They believe Trump is an ""anti-immigrant hater"", and a ""nativist"", who wants to ""close the borders"" - even though Trump is far more pro-immigration than them. 

Germans have entered on one of those frenzies where they simply start ignoring actual facts and seeing themselves as civilizationally opposed to the Anglo world. Hopefully this time around they come to their senses sooner rather than later. 

So, no, having the same legal immigration framework Australia has is not a sure path to the Fourth Reich.

1315,"USA is mostly empty with huge cities. Europe is mostly uniformly populated. This makes skyscrappers waste of money in most places.

The few places in Europe, where skyscrappers make sense because of land prices - often there are old city centers, with narrow streets and lots of historic buildings, and it makes no sense to destroy them just so you can build motorways, parking lots and skyscrappers. And you can't have skyscrappers without all that ugly infrastructure.

In Poland for example almost all skyscrappers are in Warszawa, which was heavily destroyed in WW2, so there was nothing to protect and there was plenty of land and ugly comieblocks to destroy and build skyscrappers and associated infrastructure (motorways in the city center, parking lots, etc) there.

For comparison, Lublin (which is much smaller city, but bear with me) has a well preserved Old Town, and because of that has a law forbidding to build stuff that would spoil the panorama of the Old Town. It's not like investors queue up to build 150m skyscrappers in Lublin, but even 50m buildings have to be consulted, and build far away from the Old Town.

In the end, you can have a very dense city with 4-5 stories historic buildings, or 5-10 stories commieblocks without skyscrappers, and it's actually walkable and public transport works better there, too.

1339,"All right, I leave the kitchen psychology aside as well as the contentions that ""your facts aren't facts, because my facts are facts although I never bothered to provide a source"" and ""my crowd size is bigger than yours, because that's what I count on when I want to give the impression to make a valid point"". For one, because reddit isn't really the place where I would expect to *convince* anybody of anything. And secondly, because it's a well-known fact that most conversations on the Internet are essentially ways to cope with your own confirmation bias: If you're primed on dealing with a bunch of ingrate anti-American Eurotrash freeloaders, that's exactly what you'll find every time.

That, however, is bound to get us nowhere. It's a waste of my and your time. So let's instead get straight to the question you've raised:

&gt; So you do agree that making sure NATO has a high-level of essential capabilities and has it without overreliance in the US, by having European countries reaching the targets they agreed are necessary to achieve that goal, is a good on itself?

I do agree, and our American brethren have indeed a valid point, that Europe has to step up its efforts to have access to a high level of essential capabilities without overly relying on the US in that regard. However, I and a significant number of my fellow Europeans do disagree that the way to achieve this is to just throw more money at existing structures and frameworks. 

The 2% target corridor on defence spending agreed upon in 2014 mainly was a way to give Obama some wiggle-room with an obstructionist and increasingly hawkish Republican congress: He had his diplomatic victory (""commitment from our allies"", ""strengthening the alliance"", ""we have it in writing!"") while those allies had plausible deniability because the 2014 accord *explicitly does not require* a fixed amount of 2% of GDP in defence exenditures, but a commitment ""to work towards"" that. And moreover, there are no sanctions for missing the target, so it doesn't cost anything to miss it besides the usual whining, which is bound to happen anyway, not matter what we do.

The underlying structural problem, which is the basis of much of the misunderstanding we're dealing with right now, has never been addressed: If you want your allies to cough up more money for defence, you have to explain to them why it needs to be done. If Germany were to spend 2% of GDP on defence, it would singlehandedly outspend the Russian federation - and there's no way that would ever fly with German taxpayers.

However, there is another way: Achieving high-level military capability in Europe can be done without just clamoring for more money. It can be done by way of increasing efficiency. The American military is supported by one state funding one defence department. The European military is supported by 28 states funding 28 separate military departments. That's why Europe spends [$250bn](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-defense-spending-challenge-new-transatlantic-order/) on defence overall, but doesn't get anywhere near the effectiveness the US can muster. 

You can get Europeans to rethink their spending habits if you show them a) why it's necessary and b) a way it can be done without feeding a ridiculously bloated bureaucracy of 28 separate defence departments. We could get a lot more bang for our bucks if we streamline those 28 military structures into, say, a single European one. 

But nobody ever did that. Nobody ever explained to Germans why their sons and daughters are dying on the battlefields in Afghanistan - a country that meant us no harm and the Western alliance invaded and tore asunder because the big, scary uncle across the pond said so. Nobody ever explained to Germans why all of a sudden they should spend more on weapons when they don't see a purpose.

And most importantly, nobody ever explained to Germans why they should spend more money on a military alliance that is perceived as the enforcer of *your* foreign policy, not ours. ",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8qdejc/if_europe_is_serious_about_challenging_trump_it/e0ivlan/,ColourFox,1528775277

&gt;“There was more antisemitism in this country in the past, and there are some worrying aspects like attacks on George Soros, but we are lucky in relation to other places that there have been no terrorist attacks against us for example and the main parties have been very supportive,” he said, referring to the Jewish Hungarian-American billionaire who is a figure of hate for the far-right.

I remember when his campaign started and he had, I believe, *three* issues on his website, one of which was ""protect gun rights"" (absent specifics and the stock Republican promise), [""build a wall"" recycled from Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Fence_Act_of_2006), and some other item I forget that was also a stock Republican point.  He had one thing and one thing alone to distinguish him — his abrasive image.  He offered nothing concrete and gave nothing.  He has never managed to con another country.  But he did manage to con those who voted for him.

The legacy of Trump will not be one of policy, as he *has* no policy.  It will be that he demonstrated that it's possible to find voters gullible enough to which one need promise *absolutely nothing*, yet have them believe that they've been given the world.

&gt; As the author said, Obama basically ignored Europe, due to the ""pivot to Asia"" talking point and whatnot

And no change has been presented.  Trump didn't come to office promising to forge bonds with Europe.  Trump merely continues along the path that the bureaucracy has crafted.  You are looking at his presentation and believing that it means *anything*.

&gt;That was a disaster - by the time Obama left office, Europe was engulfed in a completely avoidable migration crisis, Brexit, Russia invading countries, the NATO targets had become a laughing stock, the missile defense system had been scrapped (ironically because Obama wanted to please... Russia), authoritarian parties were on the rise pretty much everywhere and, as I've written in this sub literally hundreds of times, the EU drifting into a protectionist racket.

So Trump managed to convince you that he is addressing the migration situation in Europe, addressed Brexit, stood up to Russia forcefully, changed anything WRT NATO implemetation and — most priceless of all — encouraged *free trade with Europe*?

That is truly remarkable.  Not only is there no meaningful Trump-specific action on any of these, but many of them *directly* conflict with what Trump said he would do, like avoiding pressure on Russia.  Perhaps I've *underestimated* how effective he was in selling himself to his supporters.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8qdejc/if_europe_is_serious_about_challenging_trump_it/e0inpu7/,vokegaf,1528767361

1480,"&gt;Unfortunately for you I can still read the comment that you made your bogus claims in. You were talking about storing grid power and you said that rare earths were needed for the batteries

They are for some, there is no lie. I never claimed it was used by them all.

&gt; No engineer would use nickel cells for that application because they have a poor c rating. Magnets are not batteries and we both know you're just trying to cover up your lie.

You can not know what will be used until it happens. This is just speculation. NiMH batteries have their own advantages and disadvantages. They are obviously used in quite a bit of hybrid cars as I said. If they were shit nobody would be using them.

&gt;Maybe English isn't your native language but rare earth elements are not rare. They are called that because in the 1800s they were difficult to extract and separate and chemists thought they were rare. Some of them (such as lanthanum) are more common than common elements like copper and lead. Yes China is currently the world's biggest producer but the elements are found in every country even the Vatican.

Whether they're present or not everywhere doesn't matter. If they're hard to extract and separate and refine, they're rare even if they're all around us.

I mean english isn't my first language but the term rare is not limited like you're suggesting. For all realistic purposes if they're hard to extract and separate and refine and such we are able to produce only small amounts of them they are rare.

If all we had was ice and no easy way to melt it, water would be rare. Despite being all around us.

1529,"&gt;Ergh no. The island is Great Britain. This isn't open for discussion, it's a fact.

[Just saying this does not make it so...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain)

&gt;The **Kingdom** of Great Britain, officially called simply Great Britain, was a **sovereign state** in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. **The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706**, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, **which united the kingdoms of England (which included Wales) and Scotland** to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole **island** of **Great Britain** and its outlying islands, with the exception of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. **It also did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm.**

As for the 'Little Britain' point you make, you seem to be [confusing Ireland with Brittany in France oddly enough.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany) I thought you were smart enough to tell the difference between a peninsula and an island, I guess I was wrong lol.

&gt;Brittany has also been referred to as Less, Lesser or Little Britain (as opposed to Great Britain, with which it shares an etymology).

So lets recap. Britain = the island comprising England, Wales and Scotland. 

Great Britain = the kingdom created following the union between Scotland and England (which already included Wales). Since it's coining it can be used interchangeably to denote the island, but the original name remains simply Britain.

Little Britain = Brittany in France.

However, Africa also has a population of 1.2 billion people and we definitely cannot handle that. We need to make sure that illegal immigrants have no hope whatsoever of staying in Europe to prevent them from trying. This will also kill a source of income for human traffickers and prevent a lot of immigrant deaths at sea.

1642,"&gt;So you ignore Wikipedia and a Video about the topic. How about these:

Because the video is made by environmental nazis and ""futurists"" which are a joke

Wikipedia article is a farce, because it speaks of one research paper which is heavily disputed by every other researcher. Even the article itself admits it

And seriously linking vice for any kind of an explanation is the equivalent of showing shit to someone and saying it has the answer to all your issues.

&gt; Jacobson's conclusions have been disputed by other researchers.[11]

&gt;And that batteries need to be made without harmful materials is not an issue. You can recycle them.

Of course you can't. No recycling is 100% complete. And there is no such thing for recycling rare-earth materials.  Practically no company in the world does that right now in any significant way. Moreover, the quantities used of rare earth materials make the recycling hard and not worth it. Generally you use 50 milligrams of neodymium in a product for example. Recyling generates 90% loss of those 50 miligrams.

&gt;Indeed, a recent study from the Materials Innovation Institute in Delft in the Netherlands found that shredding hard drives for recycling resulted in a 90 per cent loss of the rare earth neodymium, used along with dysprosium in powerful magnets for the hard disk drives, with the researchers noting: “The large losses of material incurred while shredding the material puts serious doubts on the usefulness of this type of recycling as a solution for scarcity.” 

About your ""calculations"". That's all nice and dandy. For you personally. But you are not the state. You are not the world. What pays off for you, doesn't mean it pays off a state project too, or a world project.  For example state needs to built entire plants. Need new lines to it. needs to adjust the network for them, if using solar needs to figure out how and when batteries will kick in. Just  because it pays off in your little world, doesn't mean it pays off on a large scale. Renewables always had that as a bug. Large scale use, not small scale.

I myself can look further than that and now millions of Americans dont agree with Trump at all, but i expect my representatives dont do such things. They must see what is there: a very clear threat to Atlantic relations. If European leaders simply ignored that ''because millions of Americans dont agree with those policies'' we could very much be shooting ourselves in the foot. We'd risk our own futures based on goodwill and blind trust in a foreign power. Thats batshit insane. 

Im not saying European leadres are actively trying to make up some master plan and step out of NATO or anything, but im very much certain theyre developing long term ideas about how the EU should be more independent. Not per se making the militaries bigger of EU member states, but more long term plans. Think of relying less on US tech for our militaries, invest in EU military programs instead of investing in US ones like with the F35 where a lot of nations like the UK and the Netherlands are a partner in. Also creating a EU defense force would literally have the same main goal as NATO, but only for Europe. 

Im not supporting a Atlantic break up and i do fear such a future, but i expect my political leaders to look out for us and future generations and dont ignore a trend in our most important ally. I mean, we can try to sway the trend in some ways. Trump was right on one thing; the EU should increase its defense budget, especially my country the Netherlands. Its often forgotten Obama already very clearly stated this dozens of times, and the EU countries already pledged during the Obama days that we would increase it gradually for the next years, but Trump sure is pressuring that.

So maybe, just maybe, closing US bases in Europe would benefit us both. US bases arent in Europe simply to defend Europe itself. Theyre here to defend the US. Thats not a bad thing, EU leaders know this, Washington knows this, Trumps voters base doesnt know this. Im in favor of closing US bases gradually within the EU over the next 1-2 decades. It will take away any senseless arguments about the US paying for the EUs safety and it will also decrease Europes dependency on US politics. 

Besides even with the current EU military budgets we far outspend and outpower any country that neighbours the EU, including Russia. Russia isnt a military threat. Theyre a political threat.

In 2030 it is expected that solar energy plus battery storage reach price parity at which point no more fossil or nuclear power plants will be constructed and by 2050 the world is completely powered by renewables.

Quite frankly, building new nuclear power plants like in England Hinkley C with a designed lifetime of 60 years sounds like a giant gamble to me with the odds stacked against it just from an economic perspective.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100%25_renewable_energy

&gt;It is estimated that the world will spend an extra $8 trillion over the next 25 years to prolong the use of non-renewable resources, a cost that would be eliminated by transitioning instead to 100% renewable energy.[35] Research that has been published in Energy Policy suggests that converting the entire world to 100% renewable energy by 2030 is both possible and affordable, but requires political support.

The city will not cope with the 100,000s of African illegal migrants that will now be ferried straight from Libya to the port of Valencia under the orders of the champagne socialistas like Mayor Ribó, who lives in his nice neighbourhood with zero migrants. He's great for building endless cycle paths throughout the city, but useless on matters of migration.

1854,"&gt; Of course it is MY situation I talk about, it's the only one I know. Why do you think you can talk for others?

I don't know, perhaps because this isn't a thread about the specific situation of Luxembourg?

If you're actually saying you have no problem with the Italian government, and others, refusing this ship, and further economic migrants, then fine - really puzzling why you would even comment on this thread though.

Of course, that raises the question: why aren't you lobbying Luxembourg's government to volunteer to receive these people? And all the others that Italy/Malta/Greece/etc don't want to receive? There are hundreds of thousands in Italy alone, there are  dozens of millions still in Africa and the middle-east. If you're such a charitable soul, that is willing to make a sacrifice, as you claim then surely you're up to Luxembourg receiving at least a few million people? And I don't mean Portuguese families, I mean a few million of young Sunni men, many of them religious fundamentalists and with little to no skills? 

&gt;Knowing taxi drivers in Luxembourg, it's not an issue here because of regulations. We have no Uber and taxi drivers make a comfortable living here because of licensing rules and regulations that limit competition.

This made me chuckle. 

Limiting competition to Luxembourgian taxi drivers? That's great!

Limiting competition to poor people in Southern and Eastern Europe? That's, and I quote you, ""no reason to not let migrants in"".

1892,"&gt; German Energy Minister Peter Altmaier, rejecting calls from a group of other EU countries to boost the share of renewables to 33-35% of the bloc’s energy mix by 2030.

[Relevant](https://www.volker-quaschning.de/artikel/2018-01_Klimaschutzluege/index.php)

&gt; Even months after the federal elections, we do not know where a future government is heading in the areas of energy transition and climate protection. After all: With the exception of AfD, which has not even understood the simple physical background of climate change, all relevant parties officially stand by climate protection. Even at the FDP, the election platform said: ""The basis of our trade is... the Paris climate protection agreement."" However, effective measures have not yet been taken. **Even the Greens are struggling with climate protection. In the election campaign, they called for carbon dioxide neutrality by 2050 and an end to combustion engines by 2030 - too late for the 1.5 degree target of the Paris climate protection agreement.** More, according to the Green party leadership, cannot be communicated. In the end, the climate protection commitments of all parties are just fine words.



&gt; Two years ago, the international community in Paris decided nothing less than to save the earth that people could live on. The German Bundestag unanimously ratified the agreement in 2016. However, most politicians obviously did not understand what they were voting on.
&gt; 

[also relevant](https://www.volker-quaschning.de/publis/studien/sektorkopplung/index.php)

&gt; At the Paris climate summit it was decided to limit global warming to 1.5 °C if possible in order to keep the consequences of climate change to an acceptable level. **This will require a reduction in energy-related carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2040.** This means that fossil natural gas, crude oil and coal may no longer be used, or the excess carbon dioxide emitted must be removed from the atmosphere and finally stored using complex and cost-intensive CCS processes. Energy supply in the electricity, heat and transport sectors should therefore be fully covered by renewable energies by 2040.
&gt; 
&gt; The potential for biomass, geothermal energy and solar thermal energy is limited in Germany. Therefore, the major part of the future energy supply must be covered by electricity from wind power and photovoltaic systems. If patterns of behaviour and consumption remain the same, electricity consumption will rise from around 600 TWh at present to a good 1300 TWh. Ambitious efficiency measures are a prerequisite. Motorised road traffic must be almost completely electrified. By 2025, the production of vehicles with gasoline and diesel engines will have to be stopped and important trunk roads for freight traffic will have to be equipped with overhead lines. No new gas or oil heaters or CHP plants may be installed in the heating sector from 2020. For reasons of efficiency, the vast majority of room heating will in future be covered by heat pumps.
&gt; 
&gt; If the efficiency measures are not implemented, the electricity requirement rises to up to 3000 TWh. It is unrealistic to cover this amount of electricity in a climate-neutral manner in the foreseeable future. Even for an electricity requirement of 1300 TWh, the expansion speed of solar and wind power plants must increase significantly. The recommended annual net increase for onshore wind power is 6.3 GW, for offshore wind power 3 GW and for photovoltaics 15 GW. To integrate these renewable power plant services cost-effectively, **coal must be phased out by 2030 at the latest.**
&gt; 
&gt; **With today's targets under the Renewable Energy Sources Act, there is no way to achieve the Paris climate protection targets. Political leaders are either unaware of this or deliberately accept that climate protection obligations will be violated or are relying on a subsequent correction through CCS technologies. Since none of these options is socially acceptable, rapid and drastic corrections to energy policy are urgently needed.**



&gt; Conclusions of the study
&gt; 
&gt; - **For successful climate protection, the electricity, heat and transport sectors must be completely decarbonised by 2040.**
&gt; 
&gt; - Coal-fired power plants are among the biggest sources of carbon dioxide emissions. The phasing out of coal should therefore be completed by 2030 at the latest. This also requires the rapid construction of storage facilities.
&gt; 
&gt; - **With the current energy policy and the expansion corridors for the expansion of renewable electricity generation under the Renewable Energy Sources Act, renewable energies can only cover up to 35 % of the required demand by 2040. It is therefore absolutely impossible to comply with the Paris climate protection agreements.**
&gt; 
&gt; - In the future, a large part of the energy demand in the heating and transport sectors will also have to be covered by electricity from solar and wind power plants. This increases electricity consumption from the current 628 TWh to at least 1320 TWh.
&gt; 
&gt; - If ambitious efficiency measures are not implemented, electricity requirements can increase fivefold to over 3000 TWh. This demand cannot be covered by renewable energies in Germany until 2040.
&gt; 
&gt; - For efficiency reasons, vehicles with combustion engines, gas heaters and CHP plants will be phased out in the future.
&gt; 
&gt; - Therefore, new vehicles with internal combustion engines should no longer be registered in Germany from 2025, but at the latest from 2030. The most important trunk roads are to be equipped with electric overhead contact lines.
&gt; 
&gt; - Gas condensing boilers and CHP plants may no longer be built from 2020 onwards. Instead, efficient heat pumps must largely take over the supply of heat to buildings and the production of hot water.
&gt; 
&gt; - By renovating the building, the heat requirements of the buildings should be reduced by 30 to 50 % if possible over the next 25 years.
&gt; 
&gt; - For the year 2040, an installed capacity of 200 GW is recommended for onshore wind power, 76 GW for offshore wind power and 400 GW for photovoltaics. The required net increase amounts to 6.3 GW per year for onshore wind power, 2.9 GW for offshore wind power and 15 GW per year for photovoltaics.

1904,"You ignore the fact there is a legitimate crime and terrorism problem rather than just ""hurr durr they dont like brown neighbors""

I never said anything about deporting people, I'm talking about not letting people from societies with incompatible cultures in to begin with without proper vetting. There are people in mid east and Africa who have something to offer, who want to live in a free society and respect other people's freedom, who have knowledge and skills to contribute to society; I don't have a problem with them (they're a tiny minority, though). I have a problem with those who come to the west for economic reasons but who despise our values, who don't want their kids to be like us, who raise them to hate the west and not to integrate. People have a right to refuse entry to such a person. Once they're in, it's a legal and ethical nightmare trying to deport them because you have to wait until they commit and crime and hurt innocent people before you have grounds for kicking them out and by then it's too late because victims of their crimes are already raped/robbed/dead. 

I said ""*highly* disproportionate"" specifically to hedge against the argument that if there is any difference at all, that ipso facto requires a change in policy. In case of Serbians and rape; it's 3 times higher than native, which is high enough to raise an eyebrow in my opinion. Once your eyebrow is up, you can look at other factors like terrorism, differences in other crimes, differences in behavior in economic sphere, level of integration, etc and make your judgement based on this more holistic approach. Maybe certain cultures produce twice as much welfare fraud but everything else is fine, in which case it may not warrant action. I think any fair analysis of immigrants from mid east and Africa will show they do *significantly* worse in virtually all of these categories and it's reasonable for a country to restrict immigration from such places and/or institute a vetting system that insures only those who meet the criteria get in. If Germany decided to institute a tougher vetting process against Serbs or anyone else, I wouldn't have a problem with it. I'm not in favor of mass deportations of anyone but I would definitely support policies that encouraged problematic people to leave (reduction of welfare, more aggressive integration policies like banning niqab, teaching western civ, closing down Saudi funded mosques and not letting in Wahhabi and islamist preachers) so that those who are here for the wrong reasons leave of their own volition.",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/8q7zux/german_girls_murder_highlights_asylum_system_flaws/e0hlkgy/,domyne,1528730091

1911,"&gt;IIRC it started on Brexit day

Not really, and there are two other indicators that would suggest it goes beyond brexit, the first is that it wasn't a diversion from the UK to the rest of the EU, and secondly, Germany saw a similar hit over the same period.

&gt;See what happened to Montreal when Quebec tried to become independent from Canada. Even though it didn't happen in the end, the city lost a lot of clout in favour of the next best thing.

There is an impact, but the UK, specifically London, has continued to see (albeit depressed) growth, but then so has Germany. And while France has seen a boost, it isn't significantly higher than that of the UK, and its still far below both the UK and Germany's position.

&gt;See also Spain's -23%, should be related to political turmoil affecting Barcelona's economic area.

￼Quite likely.

Just on Brexit though, there are some other mildly novel counter-indications, for example Scotland has seen a major boost (even though it is leaving the EU with the UK) which would again suggest that there are a number of factors that had an impact, even if leaving the EU is one of them.",Royaume-Uni de Grande-Bretagne et d'Irlande du Nord,/r/europe/comments/8q8uhz/paris_overtakes_london_as_most_attractive/e0hllvm/,ajehals,1528730127

I would not be surprised if we suddenly see a spike in news stories that upset Bosnian Serbs and other groups, causing a bit more division than one might otherwise expect.  

Election outcomes depends more and more on Internet based news, and we've seen hate / division groups emerge into politics everywhere in Europe, which only after careful retrospective analysis can be traced back to particular exploitative sources. 

If you can meddle in elections in Germany and referendums in the UK, a place like Bosnia, with all its underlying tensions, is not going to present much of a challenge.

1948,"On **unemployment**, let me be brief but succint. Whether you were worst or second-best in the class is immaterial. What matters is that you paid a *huge* social cost completely unnecessarily.


There's no economic law that dictates that a country must go through such a wrenching economic loss for so many years. Even beyond the numbers, we're talking about a substantial part of Polish youth essentially a lost generation for 20+ years. Much like many of the Southern European countries are going through now. 

You argument basically boils down to ""well we weren't worst in our neighbourhood"". How is that ever a good argument to make? The 'inevitability' meme is often used by those who have a weakness they don't want to debate and Poland's unemployment disaster for much of the post-1991 cannot be covered up, or sold as anything else than an abysmal policy failure. 

Unless one argues that double-digit unemployment for 20+ years is 'normal price to pay' (some neoliberals will claim this!), but then you are not worth having a serious debate with.

&gt; No trade connections to the west. 

Applied to East Asia in the beginning, certainly to Japan.

&gt; &lt;5% people with higher education. 

Applied to East Asia.

&gt; 30% of employed in farming and another 30% in inefficient heavy industry producing backward stuff poorly.

Actually *better* than what East Asia had.


&gt; our choices seemed to result in the best effects.

I guess this is our dispute. I simply disagree and the numbers - barely 2.2X increase in 27 years as compared to 4-5X increases in similar time periods for East Asia - are on my side, not yours. All you are left with are defeatist and fatalistic arguments that ""it was inevtiable"". That's a sign of someone who is at wits' end.

&gt; Whatever, then 3rd best.

By the way, you accused me of ""manipulating data for ideological reasons"". But why should I accept your nonsense proposition to exclude all of Asia? Asia is the majority of the world's population and most of the economic success stories from a development Point of view are from that area. 

Excluding them makes it *far* easier for you, so I understand why you'd want to do that, but why should I agree? If you can't stand up to the success stories of Asia, maybe you don't have such a great story to tell in the first place. I stand by my conviction that the neoliberal doctrine in EE failed. EE had *great* human capital at the start of the 1990s and most countries basically wasted the first decade. Even the so-called 'success stories', such as you, only managed to grow about 45% or so. That is pathetic for a country that was as poor as you were back then, and the 1990s had very favourable global conditions. The only real crisis, the 1997 East Asian crisis, didn't really touch Europe's shores.


P.S. I am not against *all* neoliberalism. My argument is simply that countries need re-adjustment periods. I'd recommend you read Ha-Joon Chang's book ""kicking away the ladder"". You'll note that the US was doing Everything it is accusing China of today, including IP theft, trade protectionism and more. 

Friedrich List, the great German economist, wrote a seminal book on state intervention and how the state had to lead industrialisation. Germany followed this path for over a century and it was a key reason why we emerged as a strong power by the eve of WWI. The point is that transitioning countries need a grace period and East Asia studied the examples of List(Germany) and Hamilton(USA). EE didn't, and the result was sub-par performance to your potential. 

Understand that every economic system needs political legitimacy and there is wall-to-wall propaganda about the supposed benefits of neoliberalism in EE. Just because it was an unquestionably better system than rotten communism doesn't make it the optimal system, at least at the level of development you were and to some extent still are.

The main reason they'd rarely try to take one out is that they rarely met them. Besides, the Panther was a better tank all round and still got demolished at Arracourt. 

As for the Soviets, they were doing fine with the T-34 at the time by most accounts.

SFRY isn't my ideal state regarding human rights and personal freedoms, but I think you're unfamiliarity with it is showing. You're exaggerating a bit. The main ugliness really came out in the war, excepting for some suppressions in Croatia in 1971 and Kosovo in 1981 and 1989. Like I said, it was not for the state's authoritarianism that Slovenia and Croatia wanted to secede. There were a lot of reasons for it, but eh. 

Croats weren't trying to escape oppression for being Croatian in the way blacks in Sudan created South Sudan to escape persecution for being black by the Northern Arab ruling classes.

Indeed. I didn't say that the UK did better than Sweden, we clearly did worse.

That's right. I didn't say it was a distinction or anything, just that in terms of economic growth we weren't far behind.

2136,"&gt;Yes but new infrastructure will become legacy at some point and become expensive and costly to maintain and replace. 'Fresh' infrastructure is in part why poor countries get the high growth rates early on, but that advantage doesn't last.

Absolutely, but the point is that it does mean that it's easier to catch up to other countries than it is to simply develop further at that 'top' level. In short, what might have taken the UK, Germany, the US and others 100 years is doable in a fraction of that if there is the political will and resource available.

&gt;The chances of China maintaining a 5% average growth for 82 years? 0.

We seem to be conflating GDP growth with standard of living, and using some slightly off figures for GDP growth while we are at it (China's growth is consistently around 7% down from 9%, not at 5% and the US growth for the same period is closer to 2% than it is 2.5%.

Yes, before the spring of nations, nationalism was an anachronistic concept. But so was modern citizenship and individual sovereignty. The first thing we see when feudalism and absolutism make space for democracy is an ethnic split among political units and all multi-ethnic states prove instable, unless they are crushed and eradicated/homogonized, like in France.

2320,"But ""[marmelada](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmelada)"" refers specifically to jam made of [marmelo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmeleiro) (Cydonia oblonga), like the name indicates (in Portugal, at least). It is generally (though not always) hard enough to be cut with a knife, so I wouldn't even classify it as a ""jam"", in my head (I associate ""jam"" with something that flows).

""Marmelo"" is called ""membrillo"" in Spanish and ""quince"" in English.

At least in English, ""marmelade"" generally does not refer to something made of quince. According to Wikipedia: ""Marmalade generally refers to a fruit preserve made from the juice and peel of citrus fruits boiled with sugar and water. It can be produced from kumquats, lemons, limes, grapefruits, mandarins, sweet oranges, bergamots, and other citrus fruits, or any combination of them."", so it's something different.

The [Spanish term](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mermelada) seems to follow the same meaning as the English term, while the Portuguese term retained the original meaning (marmelada = jam of marmelo).

So, in this particular case, it makes sense to retain the original Portuguese spelling, when you specifically want to refer to ""Portuguese-style quince jam"", since the terms ""mermelada"" and ""marmalade"" refer to a different thing.

In the case of chorizo/chouriço, it seems more irrelevant to make the distinction, since we're mostly talking about the same thing: cured (usually pork) sausage (usually seasoned with paprika).

TL;DR: Go on google image and look for ""mermelada"" and then ""marmelada""... it's different things. You will *never* find ""marmelada de morango"" (i.e. ""mermelada de fresa"") in Portugal, ever... we call that ""doce de morango"" (i.e. ""dulce de fresa"") instead.",,/r/europe/comments/8pzczd/happy_portugal_day/e0h2udi/,fdskjfkjds,1528701452

2358,"You are being downvoted, but as a gay man I can understand this sentiment. 

One of the replies to your comment was ""every day in your life"". That's right, but it may not be obvious to you. 

Let me explain the gay situation. Even in the most acceptant of societies, showing any type of affection in public gets you raised eyebrows, and there's always the risk of being shouted at (or worse). And by showing affection, I mean pretty broad things, from kisses to holding hands, to saying ""see you later, honey!"" and even entirely mundane things like asking your partner whether we still have enough cat litter in the supermarket (because anime  could deduce you're a couple). Consequently, most gays keeps any public affection to a bare minimum. 

At the same time, public straight sexuality and affection is literally everywhere. It just is _so_ common, most of us really dont notice (heck, i barely notice it myself if I'm not actively paying attention). Next time you're having a coffee at a cafe, perhaps just count the number of straight couples holding hands walking by. Then count the number of billboards you pass on your way home showing outright sexuality. Then watch any tv series or movie at night, and even the most timid of children's shows will probably show some form of straight affection. 

The above isn't wrong. After all, 90+% of all humans are straight. But it is useful to realize you can celebrate straight sexuality every and all days of your life, just by partaking in every day society.  

I don't particularly like gay prides. I don't go there. I too think they are too flamboyant for my tastes. But I do recognize the only time I can go into town and show affection in public _without_ getting raised eyebrows - finally it's gay affection dominating the view! - is during gay pride events.

On the topic, I think this ""copyright reform"" is distilled insanity.  It is going to cause far more problems than it solves.  How are any decentralised platforms supposed to work with this?

It is just the same old song over again, lobbyists see a threat to their industry as decentralization is growing in its practical applications, and instead of trying to go with the flow they are trying to block the entire river by making it excessively difficult.  Technically, even reddit would have to *filter every post*, and they get 2 million a day.  Also, filtering is **not free**.

Fortunately, I can't see this passing through parliament.  These 'copyright reforms' have tried multiple times, each of which has failed.

2418,"Many US states block foreign companies from bidding in public tenders.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) has already concluded a Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) for the purpose of mutual market opening. This agreement has been signed by the US and the EU with their Member States, among others. However, 13 US states have so far been excluded from the agreement. These include Indiana, Ohio and New Mexico, for example. In addition, several US states have special regulations that provide for mandatory use of US products for public contracts. This applies, for example, to the use of steel in public contracts. States that have not signed the GPA or have made exceptions can discriminate against foreign suppliers and goods in favour of domestic ones. Such access restrictions, which do not exist on the EU side, constitute a significant obstacle to European suppliers' access to US procurement markets. It is therefore important to achieve further opening of the US procurement markets within the framework of TTIP.

I know what losing your freedom and being culturally hegemonized by the catalans first and castillian after means. We still even have a catalan city here. We are linguistically related to the basques by pre-indoeuropean linguistical substrata and even one of our ancient tribe groups takes the name from the Balearic Islands. Our native noble families come in part from Catalonia, from Besalú. Many of our surnames are catalan like Aymerich, Loy, Roych, Carroz, Canelles, Berlinguer, Sanjust, Cadalanu etc. So I know what being culturally hegemonized means.

2539,"Nah, it's the exact same thing. In France the president passes a decree when the parliament authorizes him to. This is exactly the same in the US. Whenever the US president authorizes a regulation it's only because the Congress specifically delegated that authority in a normal law. Also, yeah the US president appoints the highest civil servants too, but only with the approval of the senate. Very similar. 

Also, both presidents have the exact same authority over the military and foreign policy. 

When the US president has a majority in parliament, he doesn't even have that much more power. It's the congressional leaders that actually write the legislation and negotiate everything between them. The only real power the president has is to lobby members of congress.

2594,"I love how palpable your anger and frustration with life altogether is. You're in a tiny minority with this, most of the people sharing your views here are teenagers rebelling against whatever they can get their hands on, with next to no real life grievances or experiences at all. 

With you, it's beautifully clear how resentful you are. Based on your &lt;10 comment  history, you not only hate ""negroes"", gays, transsexuals, ""mulattos"" are your targets as well. 

I'm going to break something for you: you don't just hate these groups. You hate everyone who doesn't come from the exact shape mold of a loser you grew up to become.  The people who hate plurality of opinions, looks and more are the people who are uncomfortable with their very own and are forced to draw their personal identity from belonging to the faceless mass. And when others dare to go against that, where they dare to be their own people, it upsets you to your core. 

I'm sure you've convinced yourself things are going to get better for you right around now. I've been listening to far-righters write that online for nearly 15 years now and always with the same suggested imminence. Things were turning around for them in 2006, just the same as they were in 2011, just the same as they are now. Anytime now. Will happen for sure. 

Until then, there's a fix to your anger issues. First of all, inform yourself. The world has been the safest it's been in history. European countries crime rates have been dropping majorly compared to even just the 90s. The women, on whose behalf you loathe the ""negroes"" are safer than they were 5, 10 or 20 years ago. 

They also are much more aware of their rights, which is why they are less willing to be treated as property by their partners. Because, by the way, the overwhelming, nearly 90% majority of sexual abuse occurs between people who knew each other beforehand, not at the hands of the mythical negroes riding on the bus. 

Thank the feminists for that, who I'm sure you also hate and think they are destroying your culture. Speaking of culture: you're protective of it, right? You treasure it? So when was the last time you consumed any of it? Read a novel? A poem? Been to the theatre? Just some ballpark figures will suffice. 

The second major fix to your issues is even simpler. Stop being poor. All the hate in life you direct at every minority conceivable mostly comes from your dissatisfaction with your own life. Whether you are poor in finances, emotional standing or in some other way(s), I cannot know, nor am I interested in, but this much hatred can only accumulate in people living with severe regrets.

2595,"No, that's not true.

First, you could say that a country with an isolated economy — where trade is a small percentage of the GDP — isn't impacted as much by a reduction in exports, simply because there are few exports, and the dollar/euro/etc value is low.  But that doesn't mean that the domestic currency is the value that is meaningful for valuing exports when it shifts dramatically relative to the rest of the world.  Why do you care how many currency units in your domestic currency something costs?  It's just an arbitrary number.  If Russia had hyperinflation,  she might be exporting quintillions of rubles in value, but the goods she gets from the outside world are no more numerous that they were prior to hyperinflation.  She isn't suddenly getting vastly more *stuff*.

Second, I'm not sure that I'd actually call Russia highly isolated on trade.  Compared  to an EU member that does a lot of trade with other EU members, maybe.  But:

well, you seem not to have read my comment properly, because I never claimed that Trump speaks for the whole of the US. I am sure that inside the Republican party there are voices against his bullish approach. 

And while he sees himself as the leader of just the US, there are other things that the US, and thus him, should consider when negotiating with us. There are other factors to be considered in the relationship between the US and Europe other than trade balance. After all, when Italy or Germany had their own economic miracle, we practised up to a certain degree dumping and other unfair economic strategies that taken alone were hurting the US economy. But the US had more than one goal. It tolerated dumping as long as Italy or West Germany were *inside the American sphere of influence.* 

The first and foremost goal of any administration was to lure and retain Western Europe inside its sphere and well away from Soviet one. Obviously, with Russia not posing as big as a threat to its own power, this toleration has fewer and fewer reasons to exist. However, if the US wants to remain a global superpower, it cannot do without a large sphere of influence. And who replaces Western Europe, if Trump alienates it? Certainly not the poor and fickle Eastern Europe. India and China have their own political agenda and even at the height of the cold war were not part of any block. Do you seriously think India will want to get in the US sphere of influence? Don't get me even started with China.

What Trump fails to see is that the US projecting its power onto Europe is the geopolitical ROI it gets back from having us.

The US runs a trade deficit with Europe, so on balance, trade is not even that great

What is the ""ROI?"" What does the US get from protecting and catering to Western Europe? When Trump is rousing his blue-collar voters, what should he say when they ask, ""What does Europe do for US?"" I am from a European family. I was even born in Europe. I have very strong ties there, but what do I say to the 20% of the country who are first or second generation immigrants who have no ties to Europe?

The US will become minority ""white"" (the descendants of Europeans) in the next 20 or so years. The majority of the country will have no cultural link to Europe. What do you say to those people, when they ask the benefit of Europe to the US?

These are real questions. Europe has made a concerted effort to minimise its inflence in the world, and this is the result. The US is evolving beyond it's Euro-centric past.

2666,"A: This only applies to democratic countries in which the region can take due part in the legislative process and has adequately protected minority rights (including cultural rights, such as own language education for regions with endemic languages separate to the language of their country). In such countries the right of self-determination is fulfilled without secession and the right to territorial integrity triumphs. But the right to self-determination **does** translate into a right to secession for undemocratic countries culturally oppressing a regional minority, where self-determination cannot be achieved without secession. Obviously, shaping international public opinion as to which of those categories each specific secession movement falls into is often the main battle ground

B: This says regions can only secede with approval of the state they secede from. It does not state which form this approval has to take. It can be automatic (such as a constitutionally guaranteed right to secession), it can be granted by parliamentary approval (e.g the Scottish referendum), by constitutional amendment (e.g. Canada, which would approve a Québécois declaration of independence by constitutional amendment which doesn't require a referendum) or by national referendum (e.g. Ukraine, Spain, Germany). Determining how a country grants approval to a region's secession is fully up to the country's constitutional system and not part of international law.

International law does not provide that there needs to be a country-wide referendum for secession. The need for a country-wide referendum is Spanish law.

""Article 13

1.) Use of protected content by online content sharing service providers 1. Member States shall provide that an online content sharing service provider performs an act of communication to the public or an act of making available to the public when it gives the public access to copyright protected works or other protected subject matter uploaded by its users.

An online content sharing service provider shall obtain an authorisation from the rightholders referred to in Article 3(1) and (2) of Directive 2001/29/EC in order to communicate or make available to the public works or other subject matter. Where no such authorisation has been obtained, the service provider shall prevent the availability on its service of those works and other subject matter, including through the application of measures referred to in paragraph 4. This subparagraph shall apply without prejudice to exceptions and limitations provided for in Union law.

Member States shall provide that when an authorisation has been obtained, including via a licensing agreement, by an online content sharing service provider, this authorisation shall also cover acts of uploading by the users of the service falling within Article 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC when they are not acting on a commercial basis.

2. Deleted.

3. When an online content sharing service provider performs an act of communication to the public or an act of making available to the public, it shall not be eligible for the exemption of liability provided for in Article 14 of Directive 2000/31/EC for unauthorised acts of
communication to the public and making available to the public, without prejudice to the possible application of Article 14 of Directive 2000/31/EC to those services for purposes other than copyright relevant acts.

4. In the absence of the authorisation referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1,
Member States shall provide that an online content sharing service provider shall not be liable for acts of communication to the public or making available to the public within the meaning of this Article when:

(a) it demonstrates that it has made best efforts to prevent the availability of specific works or other subject matter by implementing effective and proportionate measures, in accordance with paragraph 5, to prevent the availability on its services of the specific works or other subject matter identified by rightholders and for which the rightholders have provided the service with relevant and necessary information for the application of these measures; and

(b) upon notification by rightholders of works or other subject matter, it has acted 
expeditiously to remove or disable access to these works or other subject matter and it
demonstrates that it has made its best efforts to prevent their future availability through
the measures referred to in point (a).

5. The measures referred to in point (a) of paragraph 4 shall be effective and proportionate, taking into account, among other factors:

(a) the nature and size of the services, in particular whether they are provided by a
microenterprise or a small-sized enterprise within the meaning of Title I of the Annex to
Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC, and their audience;

(b) the amount and the type of works or other subject matter uploaded by the users of the
services;

(c) the availability and costs of the measures as well as their effectiveness in light of technological developments in line with the industry best practice referred to in
paragraph 8.

6. Member States shall ensure that online content sharing service providers and rightholderscooperate with each other in a diligent manner to ensure the effective functioning of the measures referred to in point (a) of paragraph 4 over time. Online content sharing service providers shall provide rightholders, at their request, with adequate information on the deployment and functioning of these measures to allow the assessment of their effectiveness, in particular information on the type of measures used and, where licensing agreements are concluded between service providers and rightholders, information on the use of content covered by the agreements.

7. Member States shall ensure that the measures referred to in paragraph 4 are implemented by the online content sharing service provider without prejudice to the possibility for their users to benefit from exceptions or limitations to copyright. For that purpose, the service provider shall put in place a complaint and redress mechanism that is available to users of the service in case of disputes over the application of the measures to their content. Complaints submitted
under this mechanism shall be processed by the online content sharing service provider in
cooperation with relevant rightholders within a reasonable period of time. Rightholders shall
duly justify the reasons for their requests to remove or block access to their specific works or other subject matter. Member States shall endeavour to put in place independent bodies to assess complaints related to the application of the measures.

8. The Commission and the Member States shall encourage stakeholder dialogues to define best practices for the measures referred to in point (a) of paragraph 4. Member States shall also endeavour to establish mechanisms to facilitate the assessment of the effectiveness and proportionality of these measures and provide the Commission regularly with information on those mechanisms. The Commission shall, in consultation with online content sharing service providers, rightholders and other relevant stakeholders and taking into account the results of the stakeholder dialogues and the national mechanisms, issue guidance on the application of the measures referred to in point (a) of paragraph 4.*""

2838,"&gt; Still, MENA immigrants have arguably one of the worst integration records when compared to any other immigrant group.

On what metric, and due to what causes? Mentioning a problem, pointing at MENA immigrants and leaving it at that is not a proper political analysis.

&gt; When I see countries outright deny such differences exist among different demographics, I just don't know what to do.

Nobody denies differences, and I will be a happy man once that strawman finally burns.

I recommend you read some literature on the history of migration instead of following Reddit narratives as I can't simply start writing essays in reddit comments. Most of the problems we have are not even related to them being MENA or Muslim, aside from their affinity with the unstable region making the disenfranchised youth more vulnerable to radicalisation.

In a nutshell, we needed low-skilled labour to fill gaps in our industrial economy and keep the momentum, because not enough Belgians filled that up. For this task we made agreements with countries like Morocco and Turkey, in which we recruited labour force from their rural traditional areas. Then globalisation sped up, industries were moved to developing countries and we became a largely service economy with high-skill entry. Our biggest failure is that we have failed to make the children of low-skilled migrants ready for the new reality of the labour market, compared to migrants of other countries which mostly were already high-skilled, not poor people which expected their kids to reach and finish university or trade school degrees.

2858,"&gt; Saying we are importing ready-made problems is dishonest at best

It is dishonest (at best) to suggest that I am doing so, because I have repeatedly said that it is mostly an issue with their descendents.

E.g. Shia Islam isn't a problem in an almost entirely Shia Islamic country, but it does cause a problem in a largely agnostic European country.

&gt;It's the moment they have kids for which they are not in the best socio-economic position in Belgium to bring up, never had anyone inform them about the working of the school system and not used to the necessity of long studies for both men and women that problems arise.

The idea that the failure to integrate is solely due to economic issues (and therefore the fault of the hosts) isn't backed up by analysis.

Take terrorists, for instance - the most easily quantifiable data points regarding critical failure of certain cultures to integrate.

Terrorists are wealthier and better educated than their peers, studies of ISIS fighters from Europe have shown disproportionately many middle-class and graduates (especially engineers).

Yeah, but I assume that's not how it'll work.  Reddit will reduce it to ""how much do I need to pay to some company to provide a service that maintains compliance with an up-to-date union of policies across EU members and indemnifies me"".  They pay money and forget about the rest.  That'll just be a dollar value: Reddit's problem just becomes ""My costs for EU users are rising.  How do I best increase revenues from EU users to compensate?""

Also, my guess is that some members will voluntarily adopt the same policies, so it'll be less than 28 policies.

Kinda like, I dunno, how sales tax policy differs from state to state here.  In theory, that's a big headache for online vendors (""50 different policies"").

Caroline de Gruyter

In late 2015, Janes Jansa, the man who won the Slovenian elections last Sunday with his tough anti-immigration slogans, spoke in a Viennese gathering about his political plans. This was in the midst of the peak of the refugee crisis. But Jansa, a former prime minister of the right conservative party which was in the opposition then (he himself had to spend some time in jail because of a bribery scandal), mainly spoke about privatization which he wanted to enact if he came to power again. He wanted to break the Slovian old boys’ network. After the fall of the wall, he said, there had been no revolution in Slovenia. Apparatchiks started working for themselves and helped each other acquire state-owned companies. The old communists became the new capitalists. According to Jansa the real cleansing still had to begin.

Jansa had little to say about refugees, who just about walked along that Viennese window. He thought the cooperation between European countries was worthless: everyone sent the refugees on to the next country. Slovenia as well. When somebody asked if migrant panic would break out in his country, he replied: “Only if Germany or Austria close their borders.” That has not happened now, more than two years later. There are checks, but the borders are open. Thanks to the deal with Turkey the Balkan route is closed for the most part. Slovenia has accepted exactly two hundred refugees in two years, 2015 and 2016.

Why then did Jansa decide to go on an Orbán-tour this election? Why did he use an election poster with foreigners at a stop sign? Why did he say every day that Slovenia can only be safe with zero immigration? They is almost zero immigration already.

No refugee or migrant would consider staying in a country where he is treated as trash. As we know many Slovenians emigrate themselves, when they are given an opportunity to build a better life elsewhere.  The same is happening in Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Czechia, Bulgaria, and Romania. The crux of the matter: unlike Italy or Germany, where political opportunists exploit a real refugee problem, these East-European countries are emigration countries. 

At a speech in Berlin last week, the Bulgarian political scientist Ivan Krastev said that the East European hysteria about refugees reminded him of 9/11 in America. “9/11 was not about the numbers. This attack changed the way America viewed the world. The refugee crisis is doing the same to Europeans.” Suddenly there is the insight: everything in the world is connected. There are great differences in wealth. Impoverished Afghans or Africans might not come to Slovenia or Hungary, but they could come, that demographic realization took root in 2015.

What makes this alarming for Eastern Europeans, is the declining number of inhabitants of the region. In the Balkan countries the decline is greatest. Bulgaria lost 21 percent of its population since 1989. Between 2007 and 2017 3.5 million people have left Romania. Hungary lost more people after 2008 than after 1956. Add to this the endless European discussions about refugee distribution and the feeling of powerlessness is complete. “Many Eastern Europeans are facing their mortality” said Krastev. “Bulgarians are afraid that in fifty years, nobody will speak Bulgarian, or read a Bulgarian novel. They fear extinction.”

It is no coincidence that the voters who choose AfD are mainly from the emigratory regions of Germany. It this is deep, existential fear which, with the realization that you are not in control of this world, makes for people who are ready to vote for cunning demagogues. All you need are politicians like Janza, who have such hunger for power and recanche, that they are prepared to make people even more afraid than they already are.

Any kind of reform in the country should be taken with the wellbeing of the whole of Spain in mind. Not some ridiculous concession and screw the rest of the regions because the nationalists do not only want to feel special but they also want to feel over the rest.

Apart from that the very way of acting regional nationalisms have here makes giving them something highly counterproductive. You give them anything, they will make a freaking epic story out of it and will start chanting about ""how the noble people of Catalonia have epicly triumphed over the evil hordes of Spanish fascism"". We are talking about people that are already erecting monuments and naming squares and streets for the 1st of October referendum. They will assume that the way to do things is to keep coercing the rest of Spain for whatever they want, they are better and it is their right to do so. 

The Estatut of 2006 had abominations like giving Catalonia a fixed &amp;#37; of the budget every year independently of the economical situation of the rest of Spain and Catalonia's situation. They also wanted to take direct control over their judicial system and absolve their politicians from any cases of corruption. Another unconceivable thing they wanted in that Statute was having a right to veto any decisions made by the Central Government if they thought it would not be good for them. Even if vetoing them screwed the rest of Spain.

3076,"&gt; Is this even remotely enforceable?

Jurisdiction and thus enforceability is always a question on Internet policy.  GDPR, for example, may assert extraterritorial jurisdiction to mandate information policy just due to use of someone in the EU, but the US judicial system has already said that it does not recognize claims of jurisdiction from Europe based purely on being accessible in Europe — and I'd say that that's really the only sane stance, else you'd have France imposing the death penalty on French online service operators because some country has the death penalty for blasphemy.

And you need it to be enforceable, else it just means that companies move overseas and your policy doesn't work.

So, is it enforceable?

Guesses as to how Brussels can impose policy on Internet companies:

* **Can fine companies that do have an EU business presence.**  Obviously relevant to many people here.

    Reddit may not, but the server operator (Amazon, via [EC2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud), IIRC) could be made subject, and you could build a structure to control their customers via arm-twisting server providers.  Even if the EU has some sort of ""common carrier""-like status for hosting providers, they could obviously change that.  Obviously, a company could find server providers without an EU presence.

    [CDNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) also make ""who provides a service"" often lap across international borders — even if Reddit doesn't live in the EU or make use of servers located in the EU, that doesn't mean that their CDN provider isn't vulnerable, given appropriate legislation.  Dunno what the legal history is here.  

* **I suspect that it's possible to block payments to companies without an EU presence.**

    The payment provider will have an EU presence.  Obviously, doesn't work on companies that do business via selling information and never do financial transactions with end users, because they don't have a business model based on payments.

* **In the long run, I suspect that the EU may acquire the ability to mandate that a remote service be blocked by EU ISPs.**  This is the Russia/China [Great Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall) route.  Means that you don't have to screw with international legalisms — just ""do what I want or I block you and you don't have a userbase in the EU"".

    This is, for the moment, fairly technically viable, as with present Internet protocols, the destination to which you are talking does not normally enjoy [confidentiality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security#Confidentiality) from your ISP (and thus, from the government of your ISP) and thus use of a domain (going to reddit.com) may be detected and blocked, if ISPs deploy appropriate hardware.  Today, the EU doesn't require ISPs to deploy that hardware and conform to block orders from Brussels, but they could.

    Today, [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) exposes hostnames in plain text during the handshake process (i.e. the Starbucks you're at may not know the exact video that you're streaming off big-titted-latex-whores.com, but they do know that you've pulled 2GB of data off big-titted-latex-whores.com).  Ditto for your cell phone provider.  Ditto for your wired ISP.  This is necessary to efficiently support TLS-using [vhosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_hosting).  Plus, DNS is plain-text — even [DNSSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions) doesn't provide confidentiality — so your DNS queries are leaked and can be blocked.

    We could rebuild Internet protocols to provide domain-level confidentiality, but it isn't there today.

    Some people can use [VPNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) which tunnel traffic and provide confidentiality over all of its contents.  Russia's taken the ""we ban VPN providers that don't comply"" route.  Unless a VPN provider is accepting Bitcoin or something, so that you can't go after its payment mechanism, they can probably be blocked.  Also, if non-conformant VPN providers abroad are few enough, you can probably use IP-level blocking against the VPN provider.

    There are also things like [Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_\(anonymity_network\)).  That's pretty easy to defeat today via [traffic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis), if your goal is merely to detect and ban all Tor traffic, as Tor is not hardened against traffic analysis used to simply detect Tor.

Remember that you don't need to perfectly block all users from using services that you don't like.  You just need to make it inconvenient for 99% of them.

3087,"Well, I really think that the portrayal is a lot more positive nowafays dont you think?

Also, the huge development and positive impact that joining EU has had on our states has meant that the profile of our migrants is completely different (as they now tend to be educated highly qualified workers) to what it used to be.

Also the fact that we are legally allowed to migrate there nowadays as opposed to when we had to hide in trains or worse is a big achievement if you ask me!

To me all of this shows that negative portrayal and impact of migration is context dependent,not universal and absolute as some might argue, and that when the right actions are taken everyone ends up getting benefitted. This is definitivelly food for thought, IMHO, and it does make one feel gratefull for having being allowed in the Union.

I really recommend you give a look to the video I posted on the other comment, veen if its in Spanish you should check it out for the images do give a sense of what sort of country we were leaving. 

An other big thing is how things that used to be a big cultural shock for  us and our immigrants are not so much anymore, as a result of more openess, interconection and sharing of ideas between the countries, an example you cna see in the video is when a woman speaks about how shocking it was for them to see german women ""smoking"", ""drinking alcohol"" or sitting in a bar without their husbands.

3431,"In Romanian pastor is used for protestant priest, it comes from here:

&gt;Metaphorically, the term ""shepherd"" is used for God, especially in the Judeo-Christian tradition (e.g. Psalm 23, Ezekiel 34), and in Christianity especially for Jesus, who called himself the Good Shepherd. The Ancient Israelites were a pastoral people and there were many shepherds among them. It may also be worth noting that many biblical figures were shepherds, among them the patriarchs Abraham and Jacob, the twelve tribes, the prophet Moses, King David, and the Old Testament prophet Amos, who was a shepherd in the rugged area around Tekoa. In the New Testament, angels announced the birth of Jesus to shepherds.

&gt;The same metaphor is also applied to priests, with Roman Catholic, Church of Sweden and other Lutheran, and Anglican bishops having the shepherd's crook among their insignia (see also Lycidas). In both cases, the implication is that the faithful are the ""flock"" who have to be tended. This is in part inspired by Jesus's injunctions to Peter, ""Feed my sheep"", which is the source of the pastoral image in Lycidas. The term ""Pastor"", originally the Latin word for ""shepherd"", is now used solely to denote the clergy of most Christian denominations.",,/r/europe/comments/8ptauy/cioban_a_romanian_highland_shepherd/e0fbcej/,atred,1528622364

So while short-term the deficits has hurt them, they are still on the same kind of levels they have historically always been at, basically 20-25%.

My point is that the lost votes to SD basically have just cemented M to where they always were before 06-10 elections. Of course that is good and bad depending on how you look at it :)

Those smaller countries that depend on those luxury sales will be hurt very much. The leaders know that, if the people don't. 

Germany's car production required Russian sanctions be lifted on steel/aluminum. They were days away from a shut down. Merkel went to Trump, and he lifted them temporarily to help Germany's economy remain stable. 

The EU is very dependent on Russia for steel/aluminum and gas. Trump knows this, as does Merkel. He also knows the EU is afraid of Russia. The ONLY way to fix both issues is to turn Russia from an enemy of the EU to an ally of the EU. It can be done, but trying to get 28 different countries to set aside their fears and try something new for their own stability and safety is a monumental task.

It might even be the case that if the EU people think it's in their best interest to look elsewhere for possible markets, they might consider looking to their ""enemy"" for assistance. It would be a first step to a new way of thinking.

3651,"Things did change after WWII, mostly because of the Cold War. Shortly after WW2 our alliance of convienence deteriorated with the Soviets as we started to think that [they were trying to infiltrate American government](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c2/46/22/c24622008cc0a720b5a43a765882bd00.jpg). This idea is often called ""The Red Scare."" The Red Scare was so horribly widespread and believed by the masses that people were accusing others of being Communists, there would be regular hearings in Congress where a Senator named McCarthy would accuse people in government or military positions of being Commies, usually without any proof, and eventually a law would be passed that was a huge violation of free speech, a law that banned being part of the Communist party and espousing any pro Communist views. 

As WW2 ended, the US was actually demobilizing a huge chunk of its forces (going down from 10+ million to about 2 million), and the forces that were remaining were being used to occupy and rebuild Germany and Japan and were expected to be demobilized eventually. However, 5 years after WW2, North Korea invaded the South. This war required the US to start up conscription again. After this war conscription was actually left in place during peace time, which was a first in American history. I don't know the exact reason why, but I assume it's because US Presidents and other American thinkers had at this point developed the ideas of Containment. Containment was the idea that we needed to keep Communism from growing by stopping it from spreading to any other countries, because we also believed in something called the Domino Theory, the idea that if Communism sprang up in one country it would spring up in all the surrounding countries. I believe this fear is what lead to the US setting up military bases in multiple countries around the globe, so that it could maintain a global presence in case it needed to be anywhere.

Obviously, a lot of this is more complicated than I explained, but I believe that the crux of what changed America's culture to be more militaristic and interventionist/imperialistic (depending on how you want to look at it) was the Cold War. You suddenly had a case where the majority of Americans did not want to participate in WWII until Pearl Harbor happened to now more Americans than French or Germans say they would be willing to go to war with Russia over the Balkins or Poland. You also see a change in the way leadership handled things, from telling the Dutch to let go of their colonies right after WW2 to trying helping the French keep Indochine as part of their empire only a fear years later.

 Then I realized he's trying to bring awareness to all those silly people who think their country doesn't impose tariffs on American goods. Then when the ignorant rant that unrestrained free trade is wonderful, someone else will spend the time explaining that all countries should impose protective tariffs, because their businesses and economies can be easily be destroyed by other country's lower wage-rates in production. 

In the worst case scenario, if those country's leaders are actually stupid enough to impose the unrestrained free trade that they loudly promote, they would soon destroy their own businesses, economies and social programs.

His approval rating can still go up, simply having low unemployment doesn't mean it won't get any higher, what if Trump brings peace to the Korean peninsula - you don't think that would bump up his approval ratings? Such an event would be completely agnostic to unemployment levels.

&gt; This one from Reuters/IPSOS is also reputable and they think Trump's approval rating is 38%. 

Based on around 1500 respondents, ""--- No/insufficient data available for this period"", small polls like this will have very big swings, just last month the same poll had him at 48% approval

&gt; The right thing to do is what fivethirtyeight does. Aggregate approval ratings and weight them by how reputable the organizations are. As in which ones came closest to calling previous elections.

Putin's kleptocracy where he keeps going on and on about ""tradition"" is something Republicans would love in the US.

I'm not 'shitting' on anything, I'm pointing out that polls should not be taken at face value (which is that you're doing), Trump's average approval rating will be somewhere in the mid 40s, which is quite standard for a US president in a two party political system.

I'm saying historically it's very hard to unseat a sitting president, which Trump will be in 2020, now, regardless of whether you like Trump or not; it seems a little childish to refer to me as 'one of those people' (in a thread about European UNITY no doubt), while conjuring all these events that will mean Trump definitively loses 2020.

You may interpret it the way you like it, but in the end, the numbers are more similar to the polls than you seem to accept.

Also, a thing I noticed about Eurosceptics or Brexiteers, is that they always reinterpret what voter disengagement means according to their convenience. If voter disengagement is against their position it's as you said it ""**people who don't vote, don't count**"". If voter disengagement is for their position than it's also like you said it ""**Well, but they didn't get a majority of the population! So really they're tyrants and despots acting against the WILL OF DUH PEOPLE!**"", but against the EU. Kind of funny how you used these phrases to mock a remain position (which is europhile (or whatever the opposite of eurosceptic is)), while Eurosceptics use more or less the same phrases to tell the world how undemocratic the EU is. I'm not saying that you also hold such views, but at least that is what I gather from Eurosceptics online.

3828,"What I'm saying is that it doesn't just represent the European Union. If it did it wouldn't apply to Swiss peope or Moldovan people for example. It has the usage as the official flag of the European Union, but it was not created for that purpose and was only adapted to fit that purpose. The European Union falls under European unity, but European unity does not necessarily equivocate to the European Union. 

As many others are saying in this thread, the ideas of Europe and the European Union are too often conflated, which ends up excluding many Europeans who are not citizens of the European Union. I just wanted to make the distinction that the EU flag is not just for the EU. The flag is being used in its original intention, but it is not restricted to just this usage either. 

Think of it like this, if the US flag was also the flag of North America then it would be relevant to mention both interpretations when talking about the flag. Sure it means the USA, but it would also mean Canada Mexico and a whole host of Caribbean nations. It's just relevant to say that the EU flag represents all Europeans and thus its colour scheme would as well.

In the Sentio poll until now, they have been floating at around 2nd largest party in Sweden, give or take. However, in the second last Sentio poll they tied as first and in the last Sentio poll that was just published they are clearly in the lead with 26.1% (a 4.4% lead).

[You can view the election polls here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_Swedish_general_election,_2018#Parties).

One interesting thing to note about SD's growth is that they are always the inverse of the Moderates. This means that if they grow, the moderates are losing support and vice-versa. So if the trend continues as it has done for the last 4 years, they are due for more growth right before an election.

Of course they would need to gain a majority seats or get in bed with a king maker, and nobody has entertained that before.

I don't envision any scenario where supports aimed at economic or regional disadvantage (i.e you grew up in a statistically identified ""ghetto"" black spot where average school scores are far lower), would be less effective at reaching minority people in need than those identified solely by race. If the goal is to overcome racial barriers and boundaries, the existence of such supports prepetuates them as separate, different, and bound by superficial racial attributes in the eyes of the state. The very assumption that ethnic groups must automatically have barriers and advantages in common ensures a continued degree of segregation forever. I will *always* be materially different than you on the basis of my race? The longer you have an immigrant ethnicity diffusing freely through society, the more their experiences will diverge. African Americans were lumped together by slavery, and later institutional racism maintained them in a similar, disadvantaged state, but with the removal of that, we're already seeing the natural emergence of completely different cultural and class upbringings. It happened before with Germans, Swedes, Slavs, Irish, Italians, Greeks, etc - groups which could previously have been easily grouped and set apart. Once that divergence occurs, the racial group identity starts to become meaningless. The idea that government or organizational policy would use race alone to underpin targeted aid becomes horrific and unjust, because it should tell us nothing at all about a person's circumstances or situation.",,/r/europe/comments/8pu0a2/oxford_and_cambridge_threatened_with_fines_for/e0emftc/,[deleted],1528586415

Meritocary is an ideal that modern western civiliation is built upon. It's something to be pursued, but obviously difficult to reach for 100%, just like any other ideal. Saying that just because we can't have 100% meritocracy, we might as well throw it out of window and enact racist rules is as much logical as saying that just because democracy we have isn't perfect, we should switch to dictatorship.

During Felipe II's time Portuguese looked very favourably to union with Crown of Castile. Felipe IV is definitely underrated I agree with that.

Carlos I was not interested in well-being of Spain, indeed he was not even raised there unlike his brother Fernando who ruled in Austria. Really I would say while Carlos I was kind of a decent person, and did come out of correct marriage which afforded Spain its European dominance, he was not a good ruler. He inherited a very powerful rising kingdom, a recent overseas conquest and some of the richest areas in Europe then left a wholly stretched and deteriorating empire. All because of how much he invested in trying to be Emperor.

Here is what Wikipedia has to say about it:

&gt;Romanian (obsolete spellings Rumanian, Roumanian; autonym: limba română [ˈlimba roˈmɨnə] (About this sound listen), ""the Romanian language"", or românește, lit. ""in Romanian"") is an East Romance language spoken by approximately 24–26 million people[4][5] as a native language, primarily in Romania and Moldova, and by another 4 million people as a second language.[6][7] It has official status in Romania and the Republic of Moldova. In addition, it is also one of the official languages of the European Union.
Romanian is a part of the Balkan-Romance group that evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin separated from the Western Romance during the 5th–8th centuries.[8] To distinguish it within that group in comparative linguistics it is called Daco-Romanian as opposed to its closest relatives, Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, and Istro-Romanian.
Romanian is traditionally known as Moldovan in Moldova, although the Constitutional Court ruled in 2013 that ""the official language of the republic is Romanian""

Just because the soviets taught them a bunch of lies, including that they speak a different language called ''moldovan'' and many still repeat it, as those living in the soviet times are the majority these days and the pro-russian politicians there still encourage the soviet propaganda, doesn't make it right. Just as being canadian and identifying your language as ''canadian'' is laughable, being american and identifying your language as ''american'' is retarded or being swiss and calling your language ''swiss'' is delusional.",,/r/europe/comments/8pqt5a/meanwhile_in_moldova/e0dvlgo/,vladgrinch,1528557535
4317,"I do not yet know what to think of this theory, but it does have some interesting points. Humans carry a lot of evolutionary baggage with them that to this day influences how we react to certain stimulus -- take our reaction  towards negative news compared to positive ones, for example, which (supposedly) goes back all the way to reacting to forest fires, and today makes us vulnerable to knee-jerk reactions and ignoring the good because the bad is much more on our minds.

That's not to say that this should be regarded as the sole deciding factor, of course. Upbringing by parents, environment, political climate and consumed media all influence one's disposition. I might consider that genes, however, are a small *part* of this formula, which might result in some regions of the globe trending more towards various cultural traits than others.

We also shouldn't overestimate this anyways, however, even *if* the theory would be true. There's plenty countries near Poland that should have been influenced by the same gene-pool yet are much more moderate in the current climate. Even during the height of the Soviet Union, post-1950s Hungary was the least-authoritarian country in the Eastern Bloc, including East Germany. To point at genetics alone would be way too much of a simplification, but I also do not think this was intended here.

As for Japan, I agree it's a bad example, at least the way it was presented here. However, it also makes a *good* example if we consider that the Japanese in general are still a collectivist, traditionalist and spiritual people, much as they were during WW2 and before. As such the use of geographical features to try and assess these hypothetical genes might be misleading. If anything, I'd rather expect something like an open loop of culture affecting genetics affecting culture, where a ""tribe's"" challenges and ideology play a role in who gets to pass on their genes (either by survival, or by privileges or desirability).",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8pp0xb/these_are_some_of_the_articles_from_polish_online/e0dvmn5/,akashisenpai,1528557571

4343,"one thing is the fact that much of the people connive with it, either because of fear of retaliation or because it is convenient (e.g. underclass workers will not be picky about the ""job"" they get and who  provides those jobs).

Another thing is that the mafia is well equipped and connected while the police forces are often underfunded in Italy or have to struggle with the lengthy and intricate mechanisms of judicial cooperation. The ndrangheta, the mafia of Calabria, is the biggest crime syndication of Europe and directly cooperates with the Colombian cartels on the export of cocaine and other drugs. The ROI they get is massive. On the other side, police forces have to often scrap by. Also, the mafia has become bery good at money laundering, not just in the South of Italy, which is poor, but in the rich parts of EUrope and beyond. An important prosecutor in Calabria often complained about German politicians and judges wilfully ignoring the massive money laundering happening in Germany. As long as there are no bloodsheds (e.g. the 2006 Duisburg massacre), they are lenient on money laundering. Mafia syndicates have now taken root and prospered in Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Netherlands, France, etc. As long as judges get territorial and police cooperation is weak, and as long as politicians think that money laundering is a somewhat more acceptable crime, the mafia will prosper in this no man's land.

Racketeering is only a small part of their profits, and it works only in the South (where it is receding anyway). The bulk of their profits come from drugs, prostitution, and public procurement contracts. More and more countries, including Italy, are moving towards the legalisation of marijuana, but it is not enough. War on drug started in the 70s has failed. We need a different approach. Same with prostitution. The German and Dutch model have failed somehow, but still try to address the need for bringing the prostitution out of illegality.

4450,"As a rule of thumb, the more tourist oriented the restaurant is, the more expensive. I would follow these few rules:

1) try to find trattoria, osteria or bacaro (all of them mean tavern or bistrot, bacaro is a venetian term), which are normally cheaper than full fledged restaurants, usually offer only a limited number of dishes and stick to tradition instead of experimenting.

2) try going to places that cater to local people rather than tourists. There are a few signs for that. If they have a menu in English, German, Japanese or Chinese, pass on it. They will often have a daily special written on the blackboard.

3) try to spot in the menu dishes that reflect the local Veneto tradition. Restaurants catering to tourists adopt dishes that come from regions far away or are outright non italian (e.g. spaghetti bolognese). 

4) try to venture into sestieri (Venice is divided into 6 districts + Giudecca) that are untouristy. Tourists are so blind that they stay on the route St Lucia train station - Rialto Bridge - St Mark's. Most outside of this restricted area is ignored by tourists. Venues near the University, thus catering to students, or in untouristy sestieri like Cannaregio (outside the station), Giudecca or Castello are better than the central one.

5) try asking students of the university of Venice. They will know the cheap-ish places for them, where they serve cicheti (Venetian tapas) and spritz (Venetian aperitif).

Bonus point: if you can go to the lesser known parts of the lagoon, you will be able to eat even cheaper. Places like Chioggia or Torcello, for example. They are a bit far away (~40,50 minutes by boat) but there won't be almost any tourists.

4528,"**England’s Last Gasp of Empire**

LONDON - From Elizabeth I to Elizabeth II, England was an empire. No more.

&gt;Brexit has turned the twilight years of the reign of Elizabeth II into the final chapter in the history of Great Britain. What its partisans, celebrating with flag-waving in the street, tearfully called “Independence Day” will unravel the role that England has played since the 16th century as a great power, along with the City of London’s reign as a financial capital of the world.

&gt;After Elizabeth I ascended to the throne in 1558, her merchant-venturers began an imperial quest. By Elizabeth II’s birth, Britain’s empire spanned nearly a quarter of the globe.

&gt;Brexit’s fantasy of revived greatness — “taking back control” — will achieve the opposite. England’s wish to withdraw from its union with Europe appears now to have made inevitable Scotland’s eventual withdrawal from its union with England. It has also placed in doubt the status of Northern Ireland, where a majority also voted against leaving the European Union.

&gt;This misguided craving will turn Britain’s seat, created by Winston Churchill, on the United Nations Security Council into a rotten borough (as parliamentary constituencies that persisted despite low populations were known historically). The great powers will never allow this little England to exercise a veto right against their wishes.

&gt;Why did England choose this? The key is not sovereignty but a rejection of ethnic change.

&gt;“It’s not England anymore,” people told me as I traveled around the country covering the referendum.

&gt;In Tonbridge and Grantham, in Romford and Witney, this is what I heard, hundreds of times: 

&gt;“We don’t recognize our country anymore.”

&gt;Middle England did not treat this as a referendum on European Union membership but as a plebiscite on one thing: “immigration.” For Middle Englanders, “immigrants” is also a synonym for nonwhite British. Identity, not austerity, motivated their vote to Leave.

&gt;At her coronation in 1953, Elizabeth II also became the reigning monarch of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The nonwhite population of Britain then was probably less than 20,000. Over 70 percent of British workers were manual laborers.

&gt;London was far from the cosmopolitan capital it has become. In 1931, less than 3 percent of Londoners were foreign-born; that was the historical norm for the city. For all London’s trade and commerce, historians believe it was essentially mono-ethnic as late as the 17th century.

&gt;Metropolitan elites often use the Irish and Jewish settlement in Britain from the mid-19th century to bolster a national story of Britain as an immigrant nation, but the history does not fit this narrative. We prefer to forget it, but Britain’s Irish communities suffered appalling levels of ethnic hate and communal segregation into the 1980s.

&gt;Jews were expelled from Britain in the 13th century and barred from settling here until the 17th century. The extreme hostility to Jewish immigrants saw Britain largely close its borders to them in 1905, and later refuse asylum to hundreds of thousands of European Jews fleeing Nazism. In Wales, there was even a pogrom against Jews in 1911.

&gt;Before World War II, only three waves left a demographic trace on this “island nation”: Huguenots from France and the Netherlands in the 16th century, Irish migration in the mid-19th century and Jewish immigration in the later decades. The numbers were always small. Huguenots numbered about 1 percent of London’s population; Irish migration, even at its 19th-century peak, amounted to less than 3 percent of the population of England and Wales. Fewer than 250,000 Jews migrated to Britain between 1880 and 1914.

&gt;So the most striking historical trend of Elizabeth II’s reign has been a sudden ethnic transformation of Britain. 

&gt;In 1931, when the queen was a child of 5, only 1.75 percent of Britain’s population was foreign-born. Her rule saw the Empire come to Britain: For the first time, the island experienced large-scale nonwhite immigration from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. By 2011, when she was 85, about 20 percent of the population of England and Wales were immigrants or the children of immigrants.

&gt;When the queen celebrated her 90th birthday this year, more than 12 percent of her subjects were nonwhite. This is the new England, but London is already another country. In 1971, 86 percent of Londoners were still white British. 

&gt;Forty years later, fewer than half were. Urban areas with a population less than 60 percent white British now include such major cities as Slough, Leicester, Luton and Birmingham. Ethnic change is gathering pace: By 2050, roughly 30 percent of Britons could be nonwhite.

&gt;Remain campaigners argue that it was areas with low immigration that voted most heavily for Brexit. This misses the large flow of white British families from diverse cities to such areas and misunderstands them. People were voting against their town turning into London; they were voting against becoming an immigrant nation.

&gt;In Tonbridge, I heard “Enoch was right” — a reference to Enoch Powell, the politician who scandalized party colleagues in 1968 but won broad public support for a speech that predicted racial strife resulting from mass immigration. 

&gt;In Grantham, Margaret Thatcher’s hometown, I was told Britain would “collapse with these millions of Turks.” 

&gt;In Romford, a suburb east of London, I was warned that “there’ll be a civil war between the English and the immigrants.”

&gt;Since Brexit, a wave of attacks, arson and abuse has hit Britain. Historically, ethnic change is one of the most difficult things a society can go through. But why is this anger flaring with such intensity now?

&gt;Part of the reason is that the messaging of the Leave campaign suggested that Britain was under a camouflaged German diktat. A majority of those I met thought a tide of immigration from the European Union was imminent — thanks, they believed, to impending Turkish membership. This made the Brexit referendum eerily similar in emotional content to last year’s bailout referendum in Greece, which encompassed a similar psychodrama of World War II refought.

&gt;On my travels, I thought often of the writer J. G. Ballard. The English are a funny old lot, he said: They *“talked as if they’d won the war but acted as if they’ve lost it.”*

&gt;The suburbs dream of violence, he wrote. Beneath the surface, he saw an angry, lost society in which the centuries-old pillars of Britishness — empire, church, navy, class — were crumbling. This unraveling has continued inside Britain long after it ceased to exist in the world. And now the dreamers, unwitting, sickened with nostalgia, have torn down that last, threadbare vestige of Great Britain. This is the queen of England’s England no more.

And then people wonder why they call Ciudadanos philofascists.

Personally, I do not like it when politicians turn the parliament into a theater, but that is just me. About Ciudadanos, it turns out [they are in favor of withdrawing the medal](https://www.eldiario.es/politica/Ciudadanos-Billy-Nino-Rivera-Iglesias_0_777622405.html) and they have previously expressed their [support for the families that would like to find their dead relatives.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1myyVvtJQs) 

So, yes, I am one of those that wonder why do you (I do not buy the neutral ""they"", as if you did not share the same opinion) call them philofascists.  I suspect you do it just because they disagree with you, and disagreeing is fascism, apparently.

Not entirely correct. Architecture, just like art and music speaks for certain ideologies, religious beliefs and so on.

All this spamming is working counterproductive, to be honest. I myself usually ignore posts about this issue these days and I'm guessing many others do so, too.

Cause spam = annoying. 

Every new spam about it makes me less interested.

Also, dragging Orwell into the debate or calling the EU authoritarian and accusing them of censorship, or claiming it will be the end of the internet and Reddit, isn't helping to convince the masses either. Not saying *this* article does that, but many other topics about this issue do.

Stop with the 1984-bullshit and stop accusing the EU of wanting to decide what we read. Most of us don't buy it. So don't go there if you wanna convince the masses (and you need the masses).

Sticky would be better indeed; an *unbiased* explanation of what's going to happen without all the drama and with both the cons *and* pros about it. There's always (at least) two sides to a story and so far, on here, I've only seen one.

Ahora, tras el levantamiento del artículo 155 la revisión semanal y previa de las finanzas del Govern ha quedado anulada. Celaá no ha aclarado si también se ha eliminado la obligación de presentar las cuentas cada mes y eso es lo que ha generado la confusión.

in the skripal case, the russian government actively chose to use a chemical weapon on foreign soil. i don't think i have to state how absurd that is. in any other day and age the only sensible response from the uk for such a breach would have been imidiate declaration of war.

in the mh17 case it's not as black and white. as absurd as it sounds, particulary with such a high deathtoll, you would probably not wrong to assume individual fuckup or you could even argue an accident rather then a state responsibility. but if you would want to hold governments or companies responsible, its still not as black and white. malaysian airlines chose to fly over an active warzone. ukraine chose not to close the airspace, even though several military aircrafts have been shot down in that exact airspace by similar weaponsystems before and there was always a chance of those weapon systems reaching the civilian airspace. the russians chose to supply their weapon systems to the separatists (they backed). the separatists chose to shoot the missle at at cruising altitude. you could make a case arguing for the majority fault of every of those parties above. and thats even leaving out the whole other can of worms of russia saying that the weapon has been shot from ukraine and the missle was an outdated one not in use in russia anymore and the ukrainian side stating that those missle systems would have only been able to have been operated by russian special forces and not ""drunk seperatists"".

4744,"&gt; My first thought is three weeks is not nearly long enough for all those destinations. Even if you spent only two days in each destination listed (excluding travel) that's eighteen days out of twentyone.

I agree, you'd spend many of those days on trains or planes. Granted, short trips like between Berlin and Dresden won't cost you an entire day, but still much of it. You have to take into account that having a scheduled departure also will restrict what you can do before, and you have to account for checking out, getting to the station, and bringing your stuff to your next hostel.  
Put differently, you'd technically have visited many places, but you wouldn't have really experienced them. It takes some time to develop a feel for a place, and some of those cities are already pretty heterogeneous in themselves. In Berlin, for example, Mitte (the central district with post-Reunification modern big money projects and the government buildings) and Neukölln (hipster central, where you could spend a lifetime getting by speaking only English, Turkish or Arabic) are a world apart. If you only hop from one city center to the next and tick off the main attractions, it will all turn into a blur. You'd also deprive yourselves of the chance to meet people, be they natives or other travelers, and meet up with them the next day to go to the cool event they told you about, because you'd already be on your way by then. You wouldn't give yourselves the time to just hang out in a café or a park, have a beer (in most places in Europe you can have beer at 16 and are allowed to drink in public places like parks), soak it all in and reflect on the things you've seen so far. Instead, you'd end up arguing over whose must-see favorite you should visit before you need to catch the next train. It's really when you *don't* go anywhere specific and just walk around when you notice the little things that make a city what it is.

That said, some suggestions:

Sure, you want to see castles while you're in Europe, and you should. But note that there are essentially two kinds of castles, residential ones and fortresses. You can often find residential ones in the cities you'll visit anyway, but they'll tend to be of the 18th century place type. The Medieval fortresses are usually up a hill outside smaller towns that will take some time to travel to. They were intended to be strongholds, and to spot approaching armies from afar. In areas where the countryside is flat, odds are they've been razed to the ground when cannons became a thing, and their stones will have long been used for new construction if there was an easy way to get there with a cart.  
Some might tell you to visit Neuschwanstein when you'r in Munich. I know it's popular with tourists, but it's actually quite modern, from the late 19th century, when proper castles had long been obsolete. It's just a romantic indulgence of a crazy king who bankrupted himself for it. You might just as well visit the Disney version, it's basically the same thing. If you want something authentic, you'll need to go elsewhere. Your days in Munich would be better spent [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsches_Museum), or [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Englischer_Garten), or even [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dachau_concentration_camp) if you're up to it (short trip with local public transport), IMHO. Then again, he was a king who could have chosen just about any spot for his fantasy castle, so you know the landscape around Neuschwanstein is nice.

As for Dresden, I don't know. I'd recommend Leipzig instead, but at 16 you wouldn't be allowed into the clubs anyway, and Prague is well worth visiting and kinda between Berlin and Munich, too, although it would add much more travel time than a direct train between Berlin and Munich would (&lt;5h). If you took the direct connection, you could also take a break in Nuremberg and visit [the castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) there (I like smaller fortresses better, though) and then get back onto the train later that day (some train tickets allow for interrupted travel for up to three days, others are tied to specific connections).",European Federation | Germany,/r/europe/comments/8pqaio/16_year_old_traveling_to_europe_for_the_first_time/e0dfjus/,CountVonTroll,1528529245

*There were long discussions before signing the union treaty. Lithuanian magnates were afraid of losing much of their powers, since the union would make their legal status equal to that of the much more numerous Polish lower nobility. Lithuania had been increasingly on the losing side of the Muscovite-Lithuanian Wars, however, and by the second half of the 16th century it faced the threat of total defeat in the Livonian war and incorporation into Russia. The Polish nobility (the szlachta), on the other hand, were reluctant to offer help to Lithuania without receiving anything in exchange. Nevertheless, the Polish and Lithuanian elite strengthened personal bonds and had opportunities to plan their united futures during increased military cooperation in the 1560s.[5] Sigismund II Augustus, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, seeing the threat to Lithuania and eventually to Poland, pressed for the union, gradually gaining more followers until he felt enough support to forcibly evict landowners who opposed transition of territory from Lithuania to Poland.[6] A clear motivation for Sigismund was that he was the last Jagiello and had no children nor brothers who could inherit the throne. So the Union was an attempt to preserve the continuity of his dynasty's work since the personal (but not constitutional) union of Poland and Lithuania at the marriage of Jadwiga of Poland and Wladyslaw II Jagiello. The Union was one of the constitutional changes required to establish a formal elected monarchy that would simultaneously reign over the two domains.*","European Union, Republic of Lithuania",/r/europe/comments/8pkafs/map_of_europe_1500/e0dfxjq/,M_K_R,1528530028

I... have no idea what you mean by that or how it relates, actually.

Cultural neuroscience is what im talking about. Neurral connections in our brains vary depending on our upbringing - a lot of things are factored into that - class, climate, geography, genetics, and of course, culture. Different people feel same emotions in different way, for example. The differences in how we are wired are what causes different groups of people to be more or less interested in different fields as a whole. Which causes divide in class and society, because different fields pay different and offer different prestige, and since there's a class divide between identity groups, things get messy.

What does it have to do? You tell me. You say diversity does not kill. I say diversity leads to yugoslavia 2.0 due to splits in society and there being a limit on resources, as well as tendency of groups to vote as blocs when not in majority to put their hands on resources.

4855,"[Polish media veers back to pre-1989](https://www.politico.eu/article/polish-tv-viewers-turn-off-tune-out-drop-out-poland-kaczynski/)

Bit outdated article, but not less true.

&gt;The government is pushing a deeper overhaul of public radio and television, although international criticism from the EU and the Council of Europe prompted it to delay the legislation, probably until next year.
&gt;
Under a draft bill, national media are supposed to “preserve national traditions, patriotic and human values,” to “counteract misrepresentations of Polish history,” as well as portray “family values” and “respect the Christian value system.” The law would also force most public media employees to reapply for their own jobs.

This is just proper state propaganda in its purest form.

Poland dropped to [#58](https://rsf.org/en/poland) on the World Free Press index for a reason and it's still dropping.

My best guess is, that they simply *want* that authoritarianism. They *need* it and can't do without it. Maybe it's in their genes.

If our public broadcaster (NOS) would pull shit like this, there'd be public outrage and heads would roll.

But not so much in Poland.

Venezuelans had the most asylum applications in Spain last year, ahead of Syrians and Ukrainians, according the Spanish Commission for Refugee Aid (CEAR).

Perhaps there's a reason. Don't think they want even more refugees washing up on Spain's shores.

Actually yes, both issues have been taken into account as well as their negative effect. As I have said, there are many studies on this subject, in which obviously the bad scenarios that can happen are analyzed.

It would be absurd to face something as important as independence without analyzing everything positive and negative.

&gt; The problem is that you've never got more support than 48% of Catalonia's voting electorate

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/qrCum5m.png) you have the most recent results on support for independence. Independence is the preferred option right now.

I'm down for a referendum whenever you want. 

&gt; territorial integrity is a principle of international law

It is, and as the International Court of Justice have stated (like France and any other country), this principle only applies between states. Therefore, when an internal entity of a state declares independence (unilaterally), that is not considered a violation of the territorial integrity principle. Read ICJ resolutions.

&gt; If you want independence, ask for a constitucional reform that allows all of us to give it to you

It's not necessary to reform the Spanish Constitution so Catalonia can become independent. International law regulates it, not Constitutional law. Right to self-determination applies to Catalonia.

edit: As a further side-note, someone should point out to Johnson that Intel and Qualcomm (both American companies) have been leading the modem development for 5g, and Finnish, Swedish, and Korean companies are competing with a few Chinese firms on infrastructure development. 

The US has already freed up the 5g spectrum and the EU intends to partially open some of them by 2020.

And it was T-Mobile and Nokia who [conducted the first 5g data transmission test](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-mobile-nokia-collaborate-5g-145702893.html) and there are already 5g networks [deployed or in deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G#5G_Network) in many nations.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8pp19w/uk_foreign_secretary_boris_johnson_says_he_is/e0d72dp/,jayman419,1528515615

Also, you can't be a literal nazi in 2018, even if you tried. Even if someone hates and goes out of their way to cause injury to Jews, the other relevant features are not present. What about the irredentism and the expansionism and the ethnic cleansing of lands for resettling by Germans? You can't be a nazi only by being anti\-Semitic.

&gt;300 years is nothing 

Its actually quite a lot evidently, the USA literally didnt exist 300 years ago and now it's the no.1 super power. Islam did not exist in 500 AD and by 800 AD it ruled from Iran to Spain.

Hence why I also mentioned Toronto and Ottawa. A huge chunk of Canadians live in the Greater Toronto area. 



Yes. Of course language links countries, it's a huge deal, you know why Ireland spends so much money trying to revive Irish Gaelic? Why Catalans insist on speaking Catalan, or why koreans hid their literature from the Japanese who tried to stamp out the Korean language. Language is a massive part of our identity and culture, even today the Quebecois canadians and French share a special relationship for example.


.. what about Celtic? The UK speaks English yes, hence why we get along with Aussies and kiwis and such. We dont interact with France anywhere nearly as much, most of us literally cant due to language barriers 


We arent linked to Australia or Canada by language alone. Australia has a Union jack on their flag for a reason (and Canada used to have one too), they're literally descendants of British people, the queen is their head of state, many of us are literally cousins. They used to sing God save the Queen until the 1950s or so, until the 1980s anglo canadians sang the Maple Leaf Forever (""[Wolfe] planted Britain's flag on Canada's fair domain""). These ties exist because we literally created them (except Quebec ofc). Despite all this, they are independent and separate now, and none of us want a reunion either.

Learning another language is one of the best ways to learn about another culture.

Art and culture happens at obstacles, it is not meant to be easy.

A lingua franca like English is a technicality, it gets the job done. But if English is your excuse for not learning another language than you are missing out on a whole life that you are not living. For every language you are speaking you have lived another life. The more languages you speak, the more you are becoming human.

Travelers who only learn one foreign language contribute to destroying our cultural diversity. Note, that whether you speak a language perfectly or not is not important.

The UK's opposition to NS2 is almost certainly pragmatic (regional security, and national interest), I'm not sure what principled opposition would be relevant given that we trade with Russia, China, and half the middle east on resources.

So assuming that you then agree that the UK has no stake in NS2, would you also agree that Germany has a significant stake in NS2, both in practical and financial terms, and indeed that there are political constraints that mean that in the context of NS2 Germany is putting its national interests ahead of its responsibilities to its EU partners (and indeed balancing the risk to the EU from Russia with the benefits it sees in terms of gas supply?",Royaume-Uni de Grande-Bretagne et d'Irlande du Nord,/r/europe/comments/8pkw2u/all_eyes_on_denmark_after_sweden_awards_nord/e0cmf8t/,ajehals,1528492670

People do't just come over and suck on welfare, because any kind of welfare is really tough to get, especially for undocumented immigrants. Many who come here settle down and work. They do jobs that no one else wants. They take care of the fields in the Central Valley or Ventura, they mop up the floors and wash the windows, they're the ones who take care of houses.

Their children are fully American and can bleed red, white, and blue. They learn English and become assimilated. They aren't at all a burden on society.

It's so frustrating to see immigrants from Mexico and Central America painted in broad, nasty strokes. Your average man in Montana has no reason to fear the Mexians are gonna come rape his daughter, lynch him, and rob his house.

5355,"Having half of your citizens unable to vote, either because of their gender or their social status is not very democratic. And while yes, they were treated better than African slaves in the Americas two millenia later, that is setting the bar really low. A pet dog has more rights now than a black man in the pre-civil war United States. 

These are extracts from the Wikipedia page on slavery in Ancient Greece: 

&gt;Athenian slaves were the property of their master (or of the state), who could dispose of them as he saw fit. He could give, sell, rent, or bequeath them. A slave could have a spouse and children, but the slave family was not recognized by the state, and the master could scatter the family members at any time. Slaves had fewer judicial rights than citizens and were represented by their master in all judicial proceedings. A misdemeanour that would result in a fine for the free man would result in a flogging for the slave; the ratio seems to have been one lash for one drachma. 

&gt;Slaves had special sexual restrictions and obligations. For example, a slave could not engage free boys in pederastic relationships (""A slave shall not be the lover of a free boy nor follow after him, or else he shall receive fifty blows of the public lash.""), and they were forbidden from the palaestrae (""A slave shall not take exercise or anoint himself in the wrestling-schools.""). Both laws are attributed to Solon.

&gt;Slaves could not own property, but their masters often let them save up to purchase their freedom, and records survive of slaves operating businesses by themselves, making only a fixed tax-payment to their masters. Athens also had a law forbidding the striking of slaves: if a person struck what appeared to be a slave in Athens, that person might find himself hitting a fellow-citizen, because many citizens dressed no better. It astonished other Greeks that Athenians tolerated back-chat from slaves. Athenian slaves fought together with Athenian freemen at the battle of Marathon, and the monuments memorialize them. It was formally decreed before the battle of Salamis that the citizens should ""save themselves, their women, children, and slaves"".

So they could serve in the army and another extract of the same page says that they could take part in religious cults and murdering them or hitting them without justification was illegal. They do not sound like the rights of a free man, do they? They were property and any society that uses human beings as currency is not a proper democratic one.

TIL trying to keep an open border between Northern Ireland and one of it's biggest trading partners is an attempt to crash it's economy.

The EU hasn't done that, because the UK has made no attempt to do that. Saying that theirs a magical technological solution isn't an attempt.

&gt;is the best way to no deal.

Yeah but the thing is, the EU knows thats not going to happen. The Brexit-bunch might think its an option, but I assure you, the UK government knows that it is not an option, and the EU knows that the UK knows that. You aren't leaving without a deal, and we know it.

&gt;The Common Travel Area isn't ending, people will still be able to go from Ireland to the UK, just not goods, customs are the issue, not VISAs or immigration.

We want a completely open border. That includes goods and customs. This is not a negotiable position.

As well as that, I don't think thats completely true. How do you intend to deal with the fact that the Republic still has free movement with the EU? If you want to not have free movement with Europe, then you can't continue free movement with somewhere that has free movement with Europe.

5498,"&gt; Erdogan had enough power to change the constitution and change the Presidency into a much more powerful role - and then sent the country into elections so he can assume that role.

He'd been insisting that he'd wait till the regularly scheduled time in 2019 but the economic program they ran to get the growth to secure that election (there's also municipal elections in 2019) started blowing up on their faces.  They figured they'd have to risk it with a rushed election against an unprepared opposition because the way the economy was going    they'd surely lose in 2019.  The opposition performed a few tricks and proved to be agile enough to field OK candidates.  That's the story.  

&gt; If he had the majority needed to pass that constitutional change, how is he suddenly in possible danger of losing the elections, or at least having such a tight race? 

It's always been tight for him after the 2010 referendum (his side got 56% then). The amendment you're thinking of passed with a little over 50% (where the irregularities were meaningful).  All the linked piece says is the presidential election is likely to go into the second round and he may lose the majority in the parliament.  The margins the poll shows are slim though so he may slide through on both (figure in voting irregularities and when he might do between now and the election day).

5510,"sorry for the wall of text. coffee break syndrome, i guess.

i was being sloppy. the direction i wanted to point to is: in the US, the established culture seems to be that every topic has multiple pressure groups trying to push legislators whatever way. ""ordinary folks"" seem to consider this the way things are done, to reach those ""up there"" on The Hill; and the pressure groups and NGOs around ""civil society"" problems tend to be comparatively well funded because of that. I guess the sheer size of the US made this a necessity, but all the entrenching technicalities (FPTP and gerrymandering, etc) definitely don't help either.

there are lots of well-funded lobby/pressure groups in the EU as well, but they overwhelmingly represent corporate interests instead. Civil societies in the EU are lagging behind, ""ordinary folk"" have not owned up to the (new-ish?) reality that they personally need to send money to some ""far away"" NGO to represent them in ""far away"" brussels, lest their side of things be drowned out by the chorus of corporate interest groups already present there. the EU is made up of a lot of not-so-big countries, and the legislators there are closer to their constituents in terms of the lives they live. most europeans aren't used to that ""detached central gouvernment"" problem (maybe the french? dunno).

in germany, we do speak of the ""berlin bubble"" and the ""brussels bubble"", but those terms are young. american pop culture made jokes about ""buying senators is the best investment"" long before the EU made laws.

and even the really well funded publicly-owned mass media in germany isn't up to the task, yet. not too many years ago, the german gouvernment got away with taking a ""tame"" stance on a topic on the national level, lobbying for an ""outlandish"" position on the EU level they would never have gotten through on the national level, and then when the EU bowed to their will and adoped that horrible german proposal, they turned around and told their constituents in germany that they now have to flipflop on their previous ""tame"" position, ""because EU!""... and no-one at ARD or ZDF connected the dots and called them out for it. journos've gotten better, but only slightly. we're going to see the gouvernment exploit that pattern again, i fear.

all that to say: those people that do speak up on ""digital"" civil society matters do that with a lot more idealism than funding. (netzpolitik.org in germany, laquadrature.net in france, epicenter.works in austria, to name a few, and EDRi, of course). also, even if english is the de facto lingua franca for ""digitized europe"", don't underestimate the language/culture barriers and what they mean in terms of outreach workload for NGOs.

wrt germany and 5% thresholds: there was something floating around about the threshold going to be challenged on the national level again, but i can't recall any details. i thought it was ruled out on the european level by the top court? geez, tbh i'd not even be surprised if the social democrats helped enact a ruling that'll end up banning them from the parliament on the second-next election.",,/r/europe/comments/8pdlja/the_eus_copyright_proposal_is_extremely_bad_news/e0bxnj9/,z10-0,1528470972

5632,"&gt; You're right that they are a fairly recent thing, but as others have said, the pace of the world has increased dramatically. If a big company catches wind of your revolutionary idea, they can be raking in all the revenues within months without having to spend a single euro on R&amp;D and you are left with nothing to show for your hard work and, more importantly, the money you sank in development.

There are no individual inventors making breakthroughs in their garage anymore. Science is a team effort. 

Even so, what really would happen is not just one company doing that, but many of them, and the result would be that the invention would be available to as many people as possible, as fast as possible and as cheap as possible. Currently they would just get bled dry for 50 years or whenever the patent expires until it becomes affordable.

The inventor, meanwhile, can never be certain of his ROI if it comes to that because he's doing avant-garde research: that's inherently uncertain. So individuals will not risk that much money, unles they are willing and able to afford it anyway even if it fails, for the sake of the project. So the lottery ticket of copyright is not much of an incentive.

The real bottleneck is finding funding before you even know whether you will get a marketable product as a result. Again, research is a public good, it should be publicly funded. Perhaps by awarding prizes to researchers if you really want to encourage individuals: individual researchers typically don't have the expertise or inclination to market their invention and just end up selling their rights to corporations anyway. The money made with patents does not go to the researchers.

&gt;If you get rid of these protections, you will leave large companies as the only ones who are able to effectively wield technological development, which is one of the biggest complaints about this proposed bill. That's not to say big companies aren't already abusing intellectual property, they are, but if you're trying to better the system by getting rid of them, you end up giving them even more power.

Patents and copyright are used mostly to protect them from *other* companies. Private individuals are no threat, even if they sell their things freely they cannot match the price advantages of mass production and the established brands.

&gt;It can even happen with large companies. Let'sts look at China for example, who piggy backs off success in West. All the time and effort spent by researchers and developers on things like aircraft that China can easily just copy because somebody else had done the hard work. If Airbus spends billions researching some new material or innovative solution, and China just copies it immediately and mass produces it on a scale Airbus can't compete with, Airbus isn't going to make its money back on it's investment and would probably collapse.

And did patents protect them? No, they didn't. So why waste time and resources to squash small enterprises within Europe, while the real competitors in China don't give a shit about copyright anyway?

&gt;In short, removing patent protections or similar leads would likely lead to a race to the bottom where only the large players can compete

That's already the case. The large players have the most patents, and they don't even have to compete because they have demarcated their own territory by means of patents and copyright.

We are sadly right to be cautious.   
I hope you are similarly dubious of those brandishing claims when you find them appealing.      


How unlucky you are. The ""journalists, bloggers, politicians or friends/random people"" ""nuclear power enthusiasts"" you've encountered so far seem to always be absolute fundamentalists, who are ""100 % sure that nuclear is the only way"" whose issues are "" once-and-for-all resolved matter"", calling for ""leftist fear-mongering"". Almost as if moderation and pragmatism is only applicable to the renewable advocate, for whom 10 or 30% is already an achievement that ""payed off, and spectacularly so"".   
I gave you example of arguably nuclear tycoon who have been investing in renewable fro decade; can you show me similarly big renewable advocate with moderated message like ""renewable should be use when appropriate, and nuclear is important to fill the gaps; fossil is the primary target to fight climate change"" ? Because from what I see (from my biased nuclear shill point of view) is very much [1](http://www.go100percent.org/cms/)[0](http://thesolutionsproject.org/)[0](http://www.go100re.net/)[%](http://there100.org/companies) [is](https://environmentamerica.org/sites/environment/files/programs/energy/100-percent-renewable.html) [the objective](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/renewable-energy-future/), with zero space for nuclear.    
Sure, ""10 % or 30 % is still valuable"", but what if it means that the remainder has to be filled with fossil, and you end up worse than if you had kept your nukes in the first place? You end up with having a good conscience and a dead climate.



""scientists who don't have any vested interest in a particular outcome of their research"", Do you feel as strongly about the WHO, UNSCEAR and ICPR scientists when they talk about the consequences of Chernobyl, Fukushima or nuclear power in general? Or maybe are they not real ""scientists""?   
With the huge amount of power to be produced from renewable, there is a lot of money at stake too, do you also expect ""natural for a business entity to defend its profits"" and guard yourself from ""commercial entities trying to influence redditors""?     

Are you upset about bloggers/politicians/friends who whine that nuclear contribute to climate change (like 44% of French believe, even though the IPCC says otherwise), or that Fukishima has and will have catastrophic consequences (even though the WHO and UNSCEAR say otherwise)? Should you be?    


Again, if you think 2kg/pers/year is unacceptable, then I understand that **any** increase of radiation to the wildlife is also not acceptable to you. I invite you to get a good understanding of what a +3-4C climate change would mean for the planet. To put it simply, [this](https://xkcd.com/1732/) and [this](https://xkcd.com/1379/). Less [simply](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/7ki1gu/how_will_climate_change_affect_the_worlds/drf1s54/?context=3).    
And [again](https://i.imgur.com/sSTpTud.png) (or if you don't trust the IEA data, here is the [wordbank](https://www.google.co.jp/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=eg_use_pcap_kg_oe&amp;idim=country:DNK:SWE:FIN&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=en_atm_co2e_eg_zs&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:DNK:SWE:FIN:FRA:DEU&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false)).    
I let you judge what those who care about wildlife should do.    


You are very right, grid instability is, after all, nothing but an engineering challenge. Nobody is asking for faster than light travel. All you have to do is store it. Surely few billions in R&amp;D should do the trick?    
(Double standard, or is it just me?: ""there's no solution for nuclear shortfalls, we'll never find one, we should close all the plants!"" vs ""there's no solution for renewable shortfalls, we'll find one, we just need more time and money!"")     
I go back to my crisis mentality. Would you bet the climate on the fact that your R&amp;D can deliver in time? Because if it doesn't, you won't have time to turn to me and my folk to pull plant out of our ass in time for 2050, and if you want to keep the lights on, it's gas and coal for everyone.   
But, batteries?! Well, an optimistic estimate I found some time ago gives the **global** batteries storage capacity in **2040** to [759GWh](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-07/u-k-wind-drought-heads-into-9th-day-with-no-relief-for-weeks) (let me know if you have better number), tremendous, isn't it? Until you do the math: 759/24=31.6, meaning all this battery across the entire planet can store the equivalent **1** single 1000W plant. [see the problem](https://www.statista.com/statistics/530569/installed-capacity-of-coal-power-plants-in-selected-countries/)?      
.... how does that compare to digging a whole in the ground?     
(oh, and by the way, your renewable, solar panels, batteries and wind turbines, are not exactly made out of sugar and tofu. How much waste can you expect if everyone hit 40-60% of renewable? How dangerous, for how long, how much will treatment cost, who will pay, is it counted in the price? You are not planing on burying it in the ground now, wont you?)     



How would you feel if I were to find you an internet article with three scientists denying the conclusions of the IPCC? Would take it as a convincing piece of evidence? Well why your article should discredit the WHO and UNSCEAR?   


About the Friend of the Earth proposal, it says basically:   
""You can keep your plants until 2024-25, but you must:   
- have 2000GWh worth of efficiency by 2025.   
- have 2000GWh worth of renewable by 2025-30.   
- have 55% of something else in your total mix by 2031 (six years after the plants are shut down).""   
Please, do the test around you, have your savvy friends have a read and confirm that the above summary is appropriate.    
Surely the proposal sound reasonable too. They are not asking to close the plant tomorrow, nor to build a billion wind turbines in a week.    
They did the math and it reads like a pragmatic approach, right?     
Then ask them a simple question: how much are the two plants producing?     
Surely it must be somewhere in the 20 pages, right? I mean, they did the math.    
Except it isn't. They have a very convincing proposal on how to replace two nuclear plants with renewable but never do they mention that the two plants produce [8000GWh](http://www.world-nuclear.org/reactor/default.aspx/DIABLO%20CANYON-1) [each](http://www.world-nuclear.org/reactor/default.aspx/DIABLO%20CANYON-1).      
So, yeah, 2+2=16.    
On that kind of math, it's easy to sell convincing stories and be optimistic, isn't it?

5786,"&gt; So you agree that the muslims we have in Europe don't agree at 40% with bashing a woman's head in for adultery.

I'm sorry for barging in on this conversation, but that's actually a true and valid number that may even be a bit underrepresented. It's unlikely to be universally true for Muslims everywhere, but at least in one instance it has been confirmed:

In 2008 the [WZB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WZB_Berlin_Social_Science_Center) (Berlin Social Science Center, a research institute) executed a study of the results of around 9,000 phone interviews with both Christian natives in six countries (Belgium, Germany, France, Netherlands, Austria and Sweden) as well as Muslim immigrants from Turkey and Morocco. Among others they were asked the following three questions, freely translated by me from [this German language news article](https://religion.orf.at/stories/2619481/):

1. Do you believe Christians/Muslims should go back to the roots of their religion?
2. Do you believe that there's only one valid interpretation of the religious texts (Bible, Quran)?
3. Do you believe religious rules are more important than the laws of your country?

On average, 44% of all questioned immigrated Muslims to these six countries replied with ""Yes"" to all three of them. In Austria, because the article is from the ORF, the country's public service broadcaster, the number was at 55% for all three and 73% answered affirmative to the third question.

In comparison, only 4% of Christians native to Austria replied affirmative to all three questions, while 13% said yes to the third one.

The study asked some further questions, where 69% of all immigrated Muslims to Austria stated they don't want to have homosexual friends, 63% don't trust Jews and 66% believe Islam wants to destroy the Western culture.",,/r/europe/comments/8pi0ey/austria_to_close_7_mosques_expel_imams_in/e0bkpeb/,DanTheMan74,1528456965

5931,"&gt;  So you think not reporting about deaths would make us feel MORE like there is a war going on?

Its not the fault of the media. Its the egoism of the people, who only care for their only ""problems"". At first they are interested. Like a gawker gazing at an accident. Then they state their opinion. Something like ""How Horrible!"". And then they go on.

In my opinion this peoples fake emotions, to hide the fact to everyone - including themselves - that the only reason they are watching is because they are fascinated and well entertained. When the entertainment wears out, they don't care any longer. The result is that the the political pressure to stop this war is very low. To me these people are not much more like modern slaves and media-zombies. 

&gt; Islamic terror has been going on for over 1300 years and it would be going on regardless of if the US ever existed or not. They hate the US because we are the Great Satan. Satan is what lures people away from islam. The only way we can not be the Great Satan is to have a more miserable culture and standard of living than them. No thanks.

I agree. If you take a closer look the golden age of Islam was nothing but a glorified constant state of slavery, civil unrest and war. They destroyed the heritage and eradicated the collected knowledge of entire cultures. They have cut off Europe from their most important food supply and were therefore part of the reason of a more then 500 years lasting dark age. Also because the piracy in the Mediterranean sea killed almost all the trade. 

But what does this change about the fact that we had almost zero islamic terror directed at Europe before this wars? I'm also quite sure that before the US meddling in Iraq and Iran beginning in the 80s they were also save.

5966,"&gt; A good animated sub can even be superior to its orignal as they can change jokes and references around.

I disagree.

The current (and good) animated movies have a lot of work with the actors, they record the actors previous to the animation, so they animate the movie properly, and after the animation is done, they do the final record. And all of this work is controlled by the director of the movie. That work is lost in the dubbing to other languages, they are not going to care about the subtleties nor the director is going to be present.

So, for a current and good animated movie (like one of pixar), subs are always superior too.
