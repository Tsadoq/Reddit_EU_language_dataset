6,"Of course it isn't. Because we live in the 21st century and everywhere in the industrialised world (if not the entire world) is pretty great at the moment. Outside of a few unstable enclaves like Syria, Lebanon or Congo the world is a pretty good place to live. But the US still has a lot of catching up to do in terms of wealth disparity. There is absolutely no reason why children in Flint, Michigan should have to drink contaminated water or not have access to clean water for YEARS. Or why people in PR should go months without electricity or basic medical care. Or why entire regions such as the Appalachians, Georgia, and Pensyltucky are just abandoned to the wilds of the opiate and meth crisis, lack of schools and healthcare, gun crime and suicide and chronic underemployment and rural underdevelopment. 

What really really annoys me though is seeing all this and then watching the conservative news outlets in the US shit all over every other country that does anything slightly different than America does without addressing any of their own issues.

I'm not having a go at you, it's just tiring dealing with the constant superiority complex and false premise in American media that the US is a ""beacon of freedom that every other country aspires to.""

9,"Let me start of by saying I support the decision to leave. That being said:

The way leave was sold was horrendous. Nobody with any degree of foresight should have thought that leave was the better economic decision. It simply can‚Äôt be beneficial on its own. Maybe some other deals with other countries could be reached that would be better overall, but let‚Äôs be real here. That ain‚Äôt gonna happen. 

The argument for leave should have been national sovereignty from the beginning. Does the UK wish to be a Country or a State? Does the UK want London to be the capital or Brussels? At this point Brussels may as well be D.C. and Berlin may as well be Austin. (I would compare London to Albany but the UK is leaving soon)

I also have a fundamental problem with how legislative power is handled in the EU. The European Parliament is the the only directly elected branch (European Parliament, European Council, and the European Commission) yet it is the only one without legislative initiative. The only one that directly answers to the people is the only one that cannot propose legislation. 

I would have supported remain if there were 3 changes to the way the EU is run

1) the European counselors were directly elected by the people of the member states.

2) The president of the European commission was directly elected by the people of the European Union.

3) The European Parliament should be able to propose legislation (though if the other two were fixed this one wouldn‚Äôt be important)",,/r/europe/comments/a7cyqh/brexit_no_matter_what/ec5skww/,darknesscylon,1545279854

If we exclude holidays and keep the same ""last two days of the week are off"", a year of 52 weeks of 7 days (+1 day) has 104/105 off days, while a year of 72 weeks of 5 days (+0 because the bonus days are special), or a 36 weeks of 10 days (3-2-3-2, work off work off) has 144.

I'll also say that this ""second most often used division"" might not be that common in different culture : in France you'll hear people talk in half and quarter of an hour, which both would still work with decimal time, but I don't remember anyone talking about a third of an hour, we'll use ""20 minutes"" instead.

.. at Belgian Parliament (Belgium is next to France)

- Raoul Hedebouw (Workers party from Belgium) .. Both Macron and √âdouard Philippe have had to back down after almost no real change in French government for 10 years this is the first anti-government victory in a long time 
.. the Gilets Jaunes have spread to Belgium and soon they will impact the EU .. does this give you the jitters?!? it should .. it gives me no pleasure to say this
.. the GJ movement is in the process of radicalizing and becoming more violent .. they are asking to remove the taxes on fuel and second they also DEMAND a tax on the rich
.. the prime minister knows it is possible to establish a tax on the rich here and in Belgium .. do not tell us that there is no money left to invest in daycares for children and pensions for the elderly
.. when people are telling us that they can not longer make ends meet after over a year we need to send a clear message

- Charles Michel (Prime Minister Belgium) .. we need to find a compromise and a way to slowly introduce a fuel tax to bring usage under control and encourage ""environmental behaviors""

- Raoul .. (to Charles) I don't believe you really understand the seriousness of this movement and how angry these people are at the moment .. they are currently organizing for even larger demonstrations than before 
.. why should the middle and lower classes pay even more when they are already broke? the working classes pay dearly for the rises in fuel prices and you are still talking about pollution .. that is not the immediate problem
.. I told you that this problem would happen 3 years ago .. the spending budget for Belgium in 2014 was 16 Billion and now has jumped to 27 billion and yet we cannot find anything to help these people and stop the violence on the streets
.. this violence has many causes but a main one is making people live on 1000 Euros a month which is a type of violence itself .. you have told the working people no more help and if you do not negotiate there will be more violence coming
.. this is a scandal and the Gilets Jaunes will spread all over Europe if you do not compromise .. this revolt is because the people have waited 10-15 years and nothing has truly changed .. and if it stays this way the worst is yet to come from the mobs of angry people",,/r/europe/comments/a7to51/the_gilets_jaunes_have_spread_to_belgium_and/ec5nahp/,lurker_101,1545274943

Which seems very likely. Albanian has relatively few Greek loanwords but very many (down to core vocabulary) Latin loanwords despite being situated today in the ancient zone of Greek influence. At the same time Albanian has no native vocabulary for nautical terms which were borrowed from Greek, proof that ancient Albanians didn't live next to the sea unlike today. Also, very many place names and hydronyms in Albania and Romania were acquired through Slavic (or straight up are Slavic), rather than being continuously used Dacian/Illyrian names. Thus it seems very likely that Albanian and Romanian came from somewhere else in the Balkans compared to their current positions, and might have been the same language until they split and Romanian was completely Latinised with only a few Paleo-Balkan words remaining.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/a7le23/knowledge_of_bulgarian/ec5ck01/,wegwerpacc123,1545265158

Economies that are richer or less dependent on selling to the UK will be fine, unless 1) their functioning is dependent on the ECB backing their bonds and 2) spreads increase as a result of lack of confidence in the future of the Euro area after Brexit (remember that the UK can control its currency).

On the other hand, economies that 1) have a smaller GDP and thus are less able to shift revenue around and 2) are more dependent on selling to the UK than vice-versa will find it difficult to adjust to no-deal.

536,"&gt;How about half of Europe speaks a language that is a direct descendant to Latin and the Roman Empire and as such it's of enermous cultural value to us?

I am not claiming that Latin is of no value. Latin should be studied by scholars and enthusiasts but not made a mandatory subject all cross the world (as it once nearly was). There are only so many subjects that can be taught at school and I think computer programming or logic and reasoning might be of more use in the 21st century.

&gt;I understand an Icelandic not wanting to study Latin because it's incrompehensible but in countries which speak Romance lanaguages not only is it used as a tool to learn other romance languages but also to understand where grammatical features of our language come from or which sound changes made a word sound like this in French and another way in Spanish etc.

If you want to be a linguist then it might make sense for you to study Latin. For a Spanish speaker to study Portuguese is not that much work nor any other Romance language if the individual is truly interested. I would never study Old Norse to have an easier path to Swedish. All it would do for a normal person is add a few thousand unnecessary hours of study before getting to the useful part (the actual modern language).

&gt;Plus it's way easier for us because we can understand 70% of the words at a surface level and don't have to learn much as far as verbs, only noun morphology. Memorization of vocabulary is also a non-issue.

I have only lived in and travelled to South America for nearly a decade now but I have seen many people here learn another Romance language quite quickly once exposed to it, such as when living in the country where the language is spoken, frequently travelling there or by taking lessons. Very few people I know actually know Latin, but none of them can speak all the Romance languages fluently because of it.

569,"&gt; Whatever the reality is, I think It is not normal to attack police who are helping an injured person. It is not normal that if police show up to arrest a person suddenly 50+ family members show up and force the police men to withdraw. It is not normal to call a police officer ‚Äûasshole‚Äú just because it is fun to insult them. It is not normal to ignore orders by a police officer. Even if the order happens during an emergency. Classic situation: police and ambulance are at an emergency. Crowd is blocking The location. Police tell people to move on. People ignore, insult and even block the way to the location where the support is necessary. It is not normal to laugh about and make fun about Firefighter who are - well - fighting a fire in the night. And those persons were not drunken.

You would be surprised what is considered ""normal"" or ""abnormal"" in those professions. Every area, even the more rural ones, has that one bit where every police officer/firefighter/social worker will hate to go to because it always causes issues. While certainly shocking from a civilian point of view, it's not abnormal having to deal with such situations in those respective professions, no matter the country. 

&gt;You ask for statistics? Talk to the officers about their DAILY experiences. Talk with the unions about this.

I am familiar enough with the profession, by personal as well as professional contact, to be able to paint my own picture. The frustration in the police force originates from a lot of points, ""lack of respect"" is certainly a minor one, but nontheless one that likes to be brought up because it supports the myth of ""In the past everything was better"". No matter how nonsensical that statement is. I could go into greater detail about the ""big frustrators"" of the police force in Germany but that's not the point of this. 

 &gt;But there are extreme situation and such situations occur more often.

They occured a thousand years ago, 500 years ago, 50 years ago and they will occur still in the future. Don't let the amount of coverage and reporting, that is available to us nowadays, fool you into thinking that these events are extraordinary or only happen today. The only difference is that 20 years ago you would have only read about it on the 4th page of whichever newspaper you buy daily, instead of receiving a message on your phone about it 5 minutes after it happens. 

&gt;And of course THE THINGS WHICH HAPPENED RECENTLY with the right-Wing network are just NOT ACCEPTABLE and need TO BE PUNISHED!

&gt;This is a very bad development which should cause concerns!

The issue with those events is not the actual danger that these forces in the police present. While that is still a concern, the image damage is much more of an issue. Every police force in Germany is already understaffed and faces a shortage of fresh recruits, a problem that is going to become worse at the same pace that the public perception of police integrity slips into the negative. 

&gt;on, sehe, dass du offensichtlich deutscher bist. Es geht mir nicht, um die Gewalt durch die Idiotien, die eh Gewalt Wollen. Hools zB. Die gab es immer wird es immer geben und damit muss Man sich abfinden. Es geht mir um diese t√§glichen Respektlosigkeiten. Diese selbstverst√§ndliche Beleidigung von Menschen untereinander. Bin da vielleicht etwas altmodisch. Aber gerade bei Personen, die nun tats√§chlich vornehmlich Menschen helfen sollen/wollen geht das gar nicht.

Das hat man aber nunmal in jedem Beruf, selbst in solchen wo man es vielleicht nicht direkt erwarten w√ºrde. Krankenschwestern und Pfleger haben auch keinen Spa√ü auf den Rettungsstellen und dort ist es sogar noch milder als das, was Feuerwehrleute und vor allem Polizisten sich t√§glich anh√∂ren d√ºrfen. Das ist aber nunmal Teil des Berufs, so tragisch das sein mag. Im Endeffekt sind Polizisten daf√ºr geschult das an sich abperlen zu lassen - ein Polizist wird sich schlie√ülich eher selten in Gegenden stark besch√§ftigt befinden wo die Menschen die Polizei und das Gesetz sch√§tzen und respektieren. Klar fragt man sich was in dem Kopf von jemandem abgeht der einen Arzt auf der Rettungsstelle angreift oder einen Feuerwehrmann beleidigt. Genau die gleiche Frage kann man sich aber zu allem m√∂glichen Stellen. Wieso formen die Leute keine anst√§ndigen Rettungsgassen oder stehen absichtlich im Weg?

651,"In most EU countries, Brexit news get covered rather factually with only major developments getting much coverage. It is also agreed by most that Brexit isn‚Äôt really a good idea and opposed to their countries leaving the EU. Most other EU countries have also largely moved on and have much better plans in place if the worst happens. Brexit isn‚Äôt the only issue affecting the EU and all of the other countries aren‚Äôt really at risk of leaving, despite what Brexit ideologues might claim. Brexit is also the UK‚Äôs fault, the EU didn‚Äôt want Brexit and a lot of the issues voted on were domestic rather than EU problems.

&gt;Cherry picking and even wurst

It is a really problem. The EU has institutions it needs to protect and can not have them constantly undermined by having a country only agree to the parts that they like without any obligations. 

&gt;  the likes of Verhofstadt and Junker were easily as bad as Boris and crew.

You clearly not watching closely then, Verhofstadt while being a strong supporter of a federal Europe has been very accommodating to the UK demands as well as sympathetic to the issues raised by UK polticans. Junker hasn‚Äôt been that bad in that regard either and what gets interpreted as harshness is just his unsal sense of humour. 

&gt; And can we also just briefly point out that the UK wanted to enter into pre-negotiations with the EU before triggering A50 and was rebuffed, it then set out its plan, 


There was obvious reason why that wasn‚Äôt allowed and you don‚Äôt need to enter formal negotiations in order to have a plan. 

&gt;Yeah, the UK has a pretty hostile press environment. It is confrontational, it is activist, that's not necessarily a bad thing, and its certainly not a new thing.

It is not a good thing why they spread misleading information and represent certain organisations for their own gain. I am not keen on press regulation but the British press is a great argument in favour of it.

&gt;Information on how the EU works is very much out there

You can not really blame for public for it, plenty of people have busy lives and don‚Äôt have strong enough interest to research this issue in depth. The EU is also a very hefty issue, that even people who study it in depth aren‚Äôt that confident about and it doesn‚Äôt really do it favours by forcing this into a binary question. It is up to the media and politicians to put that information out there to properly inform the public. They should probably do more in education to make sure the general public are more aware of how the government institutions work. 

&gt;more people know about the EU the more likely they are to be Eurosceptic,

I am guessing that it is just the more vocal ones who are as being knowledgeable and having strong opinions aren‚Äôt the same thing. Personally I find the opposite and I have became more pro EU over time as I have done more research about the EU and come to support the EU and have a more positive view about many of its institutions of course it is not perfect but that is a far call from the negative view that many people have of it. This assertion also isn‚Äôt really supported by the data, considering how the more educated you are the more likely you are to have supported remain. 

 &gt;Euromyths seem to be the EU upset that the UK press is reporting unfavourably

No they are misrepresenting EU policy and how it works. That is why there is that list exists to help combat it.

&gt;You know, like we did in the various EU copyright pushes over the last few years and indeed the current attempt.

The outrage about that seems to be more of an online thing and there is plenty of misunderstanding of that too.

&gt;Yes.. And? There is, and has always been a Eurosceptic component within the Tory party (and a larger one within Labour).

 The Labour Party is pretty pro EU these days, with the vast majority of its members supporting staying in the EU, even among voters that is pretty high at 64%.Conservative parties elsewhere in Europe tend to be pro EU and it is pretty funny how in the UK how staying in the EU is seen as generally a left wing thing.

There is also a difference between having that component there and having them completely dominate the party like they ended up doing.

838,"&gt;In particular, Member States should take measures to ensure that UK citizens legally residing in the EU on the date of withdrawal will continue to be considered legal residents. Member States should adopt a pragmatic approach to granting temporary residence status. It is recalled that the Commission has already adopted a proposal for a Regulation which exempts UK nationals from visa requirements, provided that all EU citizens are equally exempt from UK visa requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

Well that's good to see.

Lack of point-to-point flights within the EU from UK carriers probably won't be much of an issue given that EasyJet already has a European subsidiary since the vote - is there still a major UK-headquartered airline corporation that flies point-to-point within the EU?

&gt;Regarding **road transport**, in case of no deal scenario, as of the withdrawal date, UK hauliers would have market access rights limited to the permits offered under the European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT) which would allow for considerably less traffic than what currently takes place between the Union and the United Kingdom. Current EU law contains no mechanism to extend the Community licenses, which give wider access rights to hauliers within the European Union.

This is probably going to fuck UK hauling companies isn't it?

Edit: uh

&gt;By virtue of Article 355(3) TFEU and to the extent provided for in the 1972 Act of Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities, Union law applies to Gibraltar as a European territory for whose external relations a Member State is responsible. Article 355(3) TFEU will no longer apply to Gibraltar when the United Kingdom is no longer a Member State. **As a consequence, contingency measures will not apply to Gibraltar.**

839,"&gt; Third-country nationals who want to reside in an EU Member State for more
than 90 days for any purpose need to obtain a residence permit or a long-stay visa from the
national migration authorities. Third country nationals who have been legal residents in one
Member State for a period of five years must be granted, subject to certain conditions, longterm resident status in that Member State in accordance with Union rules. 

No concrete protections for UK citizens living for less than 5 years.

But

&gt;Against this background, the Commission calls upon Member States to:

* take measures, in compliance with Union law, so that all UK nationals legally residing
in a Member State on 29 March 2019 will continue to be considered as legal residents
of that Member State without interruption;
* stand ready to issue residence permits to the UK nationals concerned as evidence of
their legal stay and right to work. Member States, in particular those hosting the
largest numbers, are invited to take a pragmatic approach, in compliance with Union
law, to issue temporary residence documents, until definitive residence permits can be
issued. Several technical options, such as national legislative measures, issuing
temporary documents or recognising pre-existing documents, can be used to take into
account the specific situations of each Member State; and
* take all necessary legislative and administrative measures to be able to issue temporary
residence documents by the withdrawal date, and to process applications for definitive
residence permits under the uniform format by the end of 2019.

906,"Ireland has historically claimed Northern Ireland as part of its territory, a stance shared by many, many people within Northern Ireland. Terrorism in the name of reunification with Ireland devastated the North for decades in the twentieth century.

With the Good Friday peace agreement and EU membership, the issue became irrevelant for a time, because there was no need for a border since we had the exact same rules and regulations about trade, and in effect the North could be part of the Irish and British spheres of influence at the same time. We even dropped our claims to the North written into our constitution.

Introducing the need for border controls at all, no matter how automated and convenient, serves as a constant reminder to Catholics in the North that they're still part of the UK, and of how they suffered under British rule (Irish Catholics endured severe discrimination during the sixties). The two communities up there still deeply resent each other, and caches of IRA bombs and weapons were still being found by the police as recently as last year.

So the prospect of outright violence breaking out isn't as far-fetched as it might seem. This isn't in any way comparable to the US/Canada border or the France/Switzerland border. It's more comparable to Jammu/Kashmir, where exactly who owns what is still very much in dispute, not a normal international border where the two sides don't claim each other's territory.

The British don't even recognise that there is any conflict, they're just treating the North as if it's indisputably part of the UK and that there is no prospect of a return to violence. It's totally reckless to ignore Northern Ireland's unique situation and just treat it like a roadblock on the way to a glorious anarcho-capitalist UK.

The only way for the UK to have everything they want is if we left too and copied all the regulatory changes they made. Either they have to stay in lockstep with the EU, or the EU (that is, us) have to copy the UK. Needless to say, that's not happening.

982,"&gt; Further, there is still [ongoing debate on the export numbers at the time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland)#Food_exports_to_the_British_mainland), 

Not really.  The wikipedia article you cite does not reflect the current state of the scholarship.  The view put forward by Christine Kinealy in the 1990s (on which much of the wikipedia section is based) that Ireland could have fed itself despite the potato blight has very little support (for the current state of the question on this, see p. 559, note 18 of the Oxford Handbook of Modern Irish History, which describes Kinealy as an exception from the consensus opinion - ""Few historians support the case ...""). Kinealy's entire view is based on the idea that all the documentary evidence we have for exports is inaccurate and that we should replace the evidence of actual historical documents with her own undocumented estimates based on a selective reading of news reports.  Unsurprisingly, not many other historians have been able to get behind that idea.

Study of the topic has also moved on in precision since then.  A more recent, and exhaustive, account of the Irish grain trade from 2004 shows that at the height of the famine in 1847 3.7 million hundredweight of wheat was imported as part of the relief effort vs 335 thousand exported. A net 13.6 million hundredweight of corn from the US was imported and the only grain that was exported more than imported was oats, which were primarily considered to be horse-feed rather than food for humans.

[http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/ecesc/Articles/Irish%20Trade.pdf](http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/ecesc/Articles/Irish%20Trade.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

The export of (comparatively small amounts of) butter and meat is completely insignificant in this picture except insofar as it looks callous for any food to be leaving the island at all. 3 million litres of butter leaving the island (probably the most shocking figure) sounds a lot, but half a litre of butter per person in a year would have made an insignificant difference to the famine.  The net of more than 1.8 billion pounds weight of grain that was brought *into* the country in the worst year of the famine, on the other hand, could and eventually did make a difference. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; While calling it genocide implies a level of coordination that was not there, it's also really irresponsible to act like the response to the famine was in any way reasonable. 

I don't think the response to the famine was at all reasonable but I was replying to the claim that it was genocide.  Obviously, I picked out the counter examples that disprove that claim.  They don't represent the whole picture but they do refute the suggestion that there was a deliberate attempt to kill the population of Ireland.

On the Greek islands where Europe‚Äôs biggest humanitarian crisis in a generation was meant to be solved, rubbish piles up for days. On Samos, which lies less than a mile from the Turkish coast, 4,000 refugees and migrants are crowded into a camp that was built for 600.

Under an agreement struck between Turkey and the EU in March 2016, these island camps were supposed to temporarily shoulder the burden of the 1.2 million refugees and migrants who had streamed across the Aegean over the previous year.

Ankara would take steps to shut down the people smugglers, the richer European countries would resettle those who had already reached Greek shores, and any new arrivals would be returned to Turkey ‚Äî for which Ankara would receive ‚Ç¨6 billion.

Islands such as Samos would host hotspots where people could be swiftly processed and dispatched back to where they came from. And gradually, so the thinking went, they would settle back into their former role as picture-postcard holiday idylls, rather than the waypoints for the world‚Äôs most desperate.

That is not how it has turned out for thousands of people living under flimsy canvas and without proper access to clean toilets as winter closes in.

By almost every measure, the agreement is either failing or falling apart ‚Äî but no one is able or willing to admit as much.

Apart from the migrants themselves, everyone else invested in it ‚Äì the EU, Turkey, and even Greece ‚Äì has their own reasons for refusing to concede the obvious, that the deal is dead.

Almost 12,000 people are now crammed into the five hotspots, which have a total capacity of just over 6,000. In Moria, a camp on the island of Lesbos that has become a byword for the squalor that Greece‚Äôs migrants now live in, the authorities have withdrawn medical services and septic tanks are overflowing, prompting the UN‚Äôs refugee agency to warn of ‚Äúsevere implications‚Äù from overcrowding.

Ariel Ricker, an American lawyer who represents people seeking asylum on Lesbos, said that over the past three years he had seen migrants die of preventable disease, hypothermia, car crashes, suicide and gas explosions, and ‚Äúmany, many others‚Äù disappear. ‚ÄúIt is a terrible thing to know deaths will come and we can do nothing.‚Äù",,/r/europe/comments/a7kjqq/europe_turns_blind_eye_to_plight_of_refugees/ec3nz94/,StirlingSauce,1545207672

1024,"International aid groups are urging Greece to pull out of the deal and move thousands of the people from the islands to the mainland. Michalis Angelopoulos, the mayor of Samos, threatened to take legal action against the government over its failure to transfer 2,000 refugees from the camps.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clearly not the solution to the problem,‚Äù Mr Angelopoulos said. ‚ÄúBut it would help ease the dreadful situation that is choking my island and its people.‚Äù


This mounting misery on the Greek islands is largely down to one glaring oversight in the 2016 agreement. It assumed that the genuine asylum seekers, who in 2015 had only passed through Greece on their way to the richer countries of northern Europe, would pliantly return to Turkey once it was made clear that they would not be allowed to go to their country of choice.

In fact, as soon as the deal came into force, the people arriving in Greece began applying for asylum there, as is their right under EU law. Nobody with a genuine political asylum claim can be forced back.

So, 33 months into the agreement, just 1,775 people have been returned to Turkey. Most are of nationalities that are almost always denied asylum, such as Pakistanis and Bangladeshis; just 337 are Syrians, the majority of whom returned voluntarily.

The returnees represent just over 2 per cent of the 75,558 illegal sea entries recorded since the deal came into effect. Greece deported 17 refugees back to Turkey in October, just one return higher than the lowest count recorded in November last year.

According to the EU, however, the deal is working. In its two-year assessment back in April, the bloc lauded it a ‚Äúgame-changer‚Äù that has cut the number of crossings by 97 per cent and deaths in the Aegean from 1,175 in the 20 months before it was signed, to just 130 since.

The numbers arriving on Samos have rocketed in recent weeks and have crept up across the islands compared to last year‚Äôs record lows, driven by rising violence in Syria and Afghanistan as well as an increasing number of Turks taking the refugee route to escape Mr Erdogan‚Äôs crackdown on political opponents.

However, the numbers are still nowhere near high enough to convince Brussels to pull out of the agreement. ‚ÄúThe deal may have proven a complete failure for asylum seekers, and for local communities enduring the devastating repercussions of illegal migration, but for Brussels, this deal remains a success story,‚Äù said Vassilis Papadopoulos, a human rights lawyer at Greece‚Äôs Council of Refugees.

That's only half the quote. The full quote is was that people are tired of experts saying they know what's best and getting it consistently wrong.

1026,"Meanwhile Turkey ‚Äì the other major player in the agreement ‚Äì has its own motives for keeping this zombie deal going. Ahmet Davutoglu, the Turkish former prime minister who brokered it with Angela Merkel in early 2016, scored some major concessions from Brussels.

Not only would Ankara receive the ‚Ç¨6 billion of EU money to help pay for the 3.5 million Syrians it is hosting, but Turks were promised visa-free travel in the Schengen zone and a kickstart to the accession negotiations that had stalled for years.

President Erdogan has used the deal to rail against the EU, complaining that Turkey has not received its money. In fact, an initial ‚Ç¨1.9 billion has been paid to 72 refugee projects in Turkey, on schedule, with a further ‚Ç¨1.5 billion already allocated up until 2020. Brussels, meanwhile, is happy to stay tight-lipped, safe in the knowledge that behind Mr Erdogan‚Äôs brickbats he is keeping hundreds of thousands of migrants off EU soil.

‚ÄúI think that the deal at hand is this twisted transactional arrangement, which works,‚Äù said Asli Aydintasbas, a Turkey expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations. ‚ÄúI call it ‚Äòthe discreet charm of hypocrisy‚Äô. Ankara keeps the refugees and is paid a hefty sum and in return, Europeans do not give Turkey a hard time about its human rights record and keep the accession process alive. This is a very cynical arrangement and as long as refugees are a factor, it will continue.‚Äù

Now struggling to cope with more than 60,000 refugees overall, Greece has also slammed Brussels for dropping a plan to relocate some 160,000 asylum seekers stranded there and in Italy to other EU member states. Only 27,695 had been moved by the plan‚Äôs end in September.

Further adding to Greece‚Äôs woes, illegal entries have surged along the country‚Äôs land borders with Turkey, choking reception centres on the mainland.

Migrant arrivals along the Evros river the divides Greece and neighbouring Turkey have shot up from 1,130 in the start of 2017 to 8,554 at the end of the second quarter of 2018, according to Frontex, Europe‚Äôs border protection agency.

Nonetheless, the prospect of 3.5 million Syrians and a mercurial leader over the water in Turkey are enough to keep the Greeks invested in the deal too.

‚ÄúAll of this set up in Greece was temporary, just an aspirin to cancer,‚Äù a senior Greek migration ministry official told The Times. ‚ÄúNow we have been left with an almost permanent situation that is continuously deteriorating and becoming more difficult to manage.

For some reason they forked WebKit into Blink. They want to have control over projects and will not let in any changes that aren't good for Google even if they are for the users. The same goes for Andoid. Both were steered away from the community while they could be developed along with the community (remember that Android started as nothing more than a Linux distro).

It would require the will of some major powers (such as MS) to fork chromium, and even then there are other factors, such as the store.

Yet the main problem is not Google, the it is that innovation requires diversity. If we all end up defining Chromium as a de facto standard basis for browsers, everything besides that will simply become unsupported, and the project stagnates, just like it happened with IE.

People made websites specially tailored for IE and forgot that there was anything else. The result of that was a decade of stagnation. Using other browsers wouldn't render webpages properly.

Google right now seems innovative, simply because that's what make them gain market share and profit. The day they no longer require innovation to profit, they'll cease to innovate.

And yes consumer capitalism had brought wealth and growth, but it's not infallible and is often exploited by the people st the very top who get totally eschewed proportions of the wealth.

I mean, how do you make sure right now in your country that only eligible people get a vote?
It really does not make a difference whether you make sure someone gets the right weight of either 0 or 1 or a weight between 0 and 1.


And repeatedly, it's not ageism. Ageism would be, if old people would lose or reduced  their vote after a supposed age of unreliabiluty, btw. Exactly as you currently don't grant votes to young people below a certain age supposing the same level of maturity/immaturity for all of them: the current system is already massively ageist.

Here, your weight does not suppose you to be fit or unfit to make decisions, only takes into account how long you will likely be bound/affected by it.

This system weights every likely personyear equally.

Right now, the longer the term of the decision, the more weight the elder get proportionally. Again, the current system is ageist (in this case, again, as with the youngster cutoff, in massive favor of the elderly).


But you don't seem to be reasonablr anyway. I eyplicitly said that only nationwide average age is acceptable, exactly because otherwise that would open up the way for arbitrary criteria and abuse. This is objective giving every person the **same** weight based on the likelyhood of them being affected by their decision for how long: it's not arbitrary, it's logical, reasonable and fsir. *And* using (reasonable) discrimination by age is not ""adding"" a critetion to the system, as the system already applies this criterion (minimum age cut-off), even worse: it applies the minimum age of cutoff **independently** whether the person contributes or not: if you are a school dropout and work *and pay taxes* with 15, or if you are a rich orphaned  heir of age 4, and pay property taxes, you still don't get a vote. What is this, if not ""taxation without representation"", which has often been the major driver for pro-democratic revolt?

In Spain there is a court room only for violence against women, you heard it right, against women. Men are jailed without being proven guilty, you can hear politicians say ""women should be believed always"", and a long etc of discrimination and inequality towards and against men.

Spain is one of the European, and hence the world, with less cases of genre violence (though in Spain there is only one genre violent against the other), every woman death is wrong but the % if well bellow 1% for women cause of death, oh and by the way, the current law hasn't fixed anything, the cases have been the same this century.

Vox wants to get rid of that law, and instead of having a ""Man against Women"" law they want a ""Violence in the family"" law, where men and women are prosecuted all the same, and go even further, they want to prosecute violence of sons and daughters against parents, against grandparents (it happens) and the other way around.

I don't think people have to lie to show their disdain towards Vox, specially here in reddit with their vocal left. Vox wants to protect Bullfighting, they want to rework how the Schengen area and the euro-orders work because of the whole Puigdemont issue and some other I can't remember, I guess you can put the gay marriage here.",,/r/europe/comments/a7f0zu/right_wing_to_farright_vox_reaches_record_high_of/ec3ivje/,WorkingSpaniard,1545200391

This was all good with the EU, which has open borders amongst its member states, but once the UK leaves the EU there is the situation of does the border remain open: since the UK will have hard borders with every other nation in the EU, assuming a ""hard"" (no special deal) Brexit, will this be enforced with Ireland and reignite the Troubles/conflict.

Confucians and Buddhists don't know what a Jew is, don't care, or in the case of ethnic Chinese, idolise them as role models for financial success. 

You might have a case for a vanishing minority of Christians who have beliefs about the Christ-killers, except that much, much larger numbers of modern Christians either feel vaguely guilty about something, or are outright worshipful and obsequious towards Jews. 

I really, really don't think that there is a similar proportion of the Muslim world that will die en masse to distract attention from Israel or to rescue individual Jews from persecution. 

What else is there, really? Zoroastrians, voodoo priests...actually, neopagans might hold really anti-semitic views, not sure on that one. But that's about all.

It's been the experience in Europe and elsewhere, that as the Muslim population rises, the number of hate crimes committed against synagogues, Jewish schools etc rises as well.

The British empire was one of the most evil empires in history and the revisionist Irish historians give it far too much credit.  A bit of maize here, a soup kitchen there, sure they tried lads....nah fuck off. There were famines wherever the British empire went because food was a weapon, a strategy they mastered in the second boer war and something they and their  partners are continuing to  inflict on Yemen today. 

What you wrote about Tim Pat is just an  ad-hominem. Whether or not he is an academic historian according to your lofty standards of who is acceptable to write about Irish history is irrelevant.

1196,"Another example involves a PRIVATE scholarship, offered by the widow of a male veterinarian in his honour. Looking for a male wanting to specialise in large animals, like he did, in a medical field that's greater than 90% female students. Still had people frothing at the mouth and throwing a wobbler about muh soggy knee.

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/08/sydney-university-under-fire-for-vet-scholarship-giving-preference-to-males

&gt;A female student, in her second year of her doctor of veterinary medicine degree, told Guardian Australia she was ‚Äúvery surprised‚Äù to see that preference would be given to male students and thought that it was an administrative error

&gt;The student said that though there were more women in the veterinary medicine program than men, there were more structural barriers to their advancing in the profession. There was also a gender pay gap, compounded by fewer women in senior positions.

&gt;She said the university was ‚Äúmisguided‚Äù to offer the scholarship

&gt;They‚Äôre not addressing gender inequality in an intelligent way, and I think the university should be held to a higher standard. ‚Ä¶ It seems they care more about money than they do about my being a woman and getting equal opportunities

&gt;Fellow women‚Äôs officer, Imogen Grant, said the comparison with scholarships for Aboriginal Australians was a ‚Äúcompletely inappropriate‚Äù, and that there was no excuse for the university to be ‚Äúcomplacent about discrimination‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúThe way I think about it, affirmative action should only apply to people who have structural barriers to receiving an education ‚Äì that‚Äôs what the exemption in discrimination law is about, so you can procure particular benefits for women in Stem [science, technology, engineering and mathematics], Aboriginal students and so on,‚Äù Grant said.

&gt;‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not for further advantaging men. It‚Äôs really quite bizarre.‚Äù

&gt;The University of Sydney Women‚Äôs Collective is calling on the university to remove ‚Äúmale‚Äù from the eligibility requirements ‚Äì to ‚Äúsend a clear message to all students that sexism and discrimination on campus is unacceptable‚Äù

It is true that a 2nd referendum is warranted, but not for the reasons you mention. It is necessary because the results were so close, the electorate changed (new voters, deaths), illegal campaign acts have been identified and much more is now known. Having said that, the whole idea of a referendum on this issue is very bad, it is not an example of good democracy. Parliament is sovereign exactly for the reason that voters are unable to make informed decisions about such complex issues. MPs have the time and the resources to find out what the consequences will be, while voters do not, they vote on gut feelings.

This is really a decision that should have been made by MPs in the first place. They decided to shirk their duties and have the voters decide on something voters cannot understand in full. The result was a disaster.

As we all know, the referendum was launched to save the Tory party, it ended up harming the nation. May is complicit in this and that is her sin.

1255,"Well, our Andreotti I cabinet lasted 8 days only, from June 18th to 26th in 1972. It didn't win the required confidence motion after the appointment (a vote to be held within 10 days), and thus resigned even before reaching full power. Similar events happened before and after (De Gasperi VIII and Fanfani I in 1953 and 1954, Andreotti V and Fanfani VI in 1979 and 1987, respectively). Instead, the shortest cabinet having won the initial confidence motion in both houses was Moro V which lasted 78 days before losing another confidence vote.

Whatever the case, the above said figures refer to the number of days elapsed between the formal cabinet appointment and the moment they lost (or missed) the confidence motion in either house: after their formal forced resignation they remained in office as current-affairs cabinets for a number of days until a new cabinet could be appointed. Fanfani I (1954) was the overall shortest: 11 days before losing (or missing) parliamentary confidence, 12 days in office. Among those that never won the confidence motion, Andreotti V (1979) resigned after 10 days, but overall remained in office for 137 days (there was an early election in-between).

The longest cabinet of the Italian republic has been the Berlusconi II, which remained in office for 1412 days (1409 before resignation) between June 2001 and April 2005. The overall longest since Italy exists as a unified country is the Mussolini cabinet which is formally counted among Italian cabinets having been lawfully appointed by the king: it lasted for 7571 days (7573 days in office), that is 20 years, 8 months, and 25 days, from October 28th, 1922, to July 25th, 1943 (the day Fascism fell). It was preceded by the Facta II cabinet and followed by the Badoglio I cabinet. Besides Mussolini, the longest of the kingdom of Italy was the Lanza cabinet (1871-1873) which nonetheless did not reach the Berlusconi II longevity.

Instead, if we count how many days each prime minister hold office, irrespective of how many cabinets they led, Mussolini is still the longest holder with 7573 days in office (one cabinet), then comes [Giovanni Giolitti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Giolitti) with 3839 days (five cabinets), and third Berlusconi with 3339 days (four cabinets). The ones who led the highest number of cabinets were [Agostino Depretis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agostino_Depretis) during the kingdom and [Alcide De Gasperi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcide_De_Gasperi) (a father of the EU) during the republic: eight cabinets each.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/a7e74j/belgian_prime_minister_resigns_after_losing_vote/ec3dqgu/,gerri_,1545194555

But, when we rely only on our politicians, it‚Äôs their viewpoints that the citizens choose from and not the other way around, and that allows money to have a very very loud voice IMO.

1290,"* I know that If Britain and Germany never got into two wars with each other but instead allied together(which is what in hindsight we shouldve done, and its what Hitler personally wanted(he offered very good peace terms(ie Britain would be left alone if we stayed out of the war) many times) as he admired Britain and wanted Germany to emulate the UK, The Germans considered Brits to be their brothers a family etc) we'd of been unstoppable together with our combined scientific, cultral, military &amp; economic might &amp; know how. We'd of easily achieved a scientific, cultral &amp; economic &amp; military total victories and of been ruling the world for centuries to come etc even today, oh what couldve been eh... Instead we chose the short term view and chose bloodshed. It was all so avoidable. All so unnessecary.


* I also know that war couldve been avoided alot early if France and co had just marched into the Rhineland or the CzechSlovakia etc in the mid-30s and halted German advances before they really got going. As at that point Germany didnt really have the capacity to fight back or do anything. But alas nothing was done to stop Germany sooner when it wouldve been possible and very easy to do so.


* I know that Germany was very close too and shouldve won the Battle of Britain. They were successfully bombing the RAF bases, absolutely destroying Britain's airforce, nearly bringing it too it knees &amp; Britain too surrender... but for some reason Hitler called off and stopped the bombing of RAF bases and air fields instead to focus bombing on the cities(aka The Blitz), and well it allowed the RAF to recover and rebuild, and the rest as they say is history. 


* Dunkirk... I know that the Germans had a chance to wipeout the British army, but again for some reason Hitler called off the German advance allowing the British to escape across The Channel. The war in the West and the Battle and defeat of Britain wouldve been achieved if not for those two strategic blunders by Hitler.


* I know that Hitler he was Germany's worst enemy in a way. I say that cuz he made soooo many avoidable mistakes and truly brain dead, stupid decisions that cost Germany a war that they couldve &amp; shouldve won. I mean he thought he was smarter and knew better than his highly capable generals, when its clear he had no clue what he was doing. Yet he saw himself as a military genius when he was anything but. 


* I know that Hitler's own generals in the Wermacht and many in the intelligence service(The Abwehr, infact The Abwehr many times throughout the war iirc delibrately gave Hitler information &amp; intel that they knew was false or completely made up or they purposefully sabotaged many spying operations etc, such was the dislike and ideological differences between Hitler and the many anti-nazis in the Abwehr, who could not stand Hitler. It seems they were some of the few Germans at the time who saw Hitler for what he really was) had secret plans to get rid of him prior to WW2, as they saw him as a dangerous, insane nutjob who'd end up destroying Germany. Hitler at the start was not well liked by many senior people in the army.


* It maybe hard to understand, but I know that Hitler did actually genueinely think and believe he was doing the right thing. He didnt see himself or Nazi Germany as the bad guys.



* I know that the UK to a large extent did pretty much saved Europe from itself and its tribal nonsense. Without us Brits stepping in Europe would be a very different place today... Its why i always shake my head at how the EU and this sub is so often very anti-British, and has such hate, sneering &amp; contempt for the uk... Oh how quickly they forget everything Britain did for them and their respective countries. Infact they're only able to be on this sub ultimately cuz of the UK's effort and sacrifice. So some gratitude would be nice.


* I know that the cutting edge, advanced German technology &amp; R&amp;D &amp; German IP was all stolen by America after the war. Infact it was German WW2 scientists &amp; science that took America/put a man on the moon in 1969.


* I know of the immense effort and sacrifice by the UK's Empire/Commonwealth troops(Indians, Australians, Africans, Canadians, Kiwis, Caribbean/West Indian) and also of the USA's Black GIs etc which all too often the contribution by these two groups is overlooked and ignored, its as if they werent there, when it really shouldnt be. They deserve far more recognition.


* I know that ultimately it was a conflict that didnt have to happen. It was not inevitable, and if the correct actions were taken beforehand WW2 wouldve been all so avoidable.",England,/r/europe/comments/a7a254/what_do_you_know_about_world_war_ii/ec3ev4r/,GoGoGo_PowerRanger94,1545195681

1336,"&gt;Not really, as it would lock in those policies and create a soft legal framework to reject changing those policies towards a more restrictive policy even if the population would favor so.

I personally wouldn't mind, in fact that would be my personal desired outcome. Nonetheless, I could imagine that some people don't like that, so:

The pact builds further on existing UN treaties. Human rights, the refugee statute,... It's a pledge to among other things, guarantee basic human rights for migrants. We were already doing that after signing the existing UN treaties. Those are the ones that are already restricting possible new policies. Unless people have a problem with the UN human rights, in which case they can fall from a bridge for all I care, there is no problem. If the population suddenly would be for policies that violate human rights, then I'd be glad our government legally can't have them because of already existing treaties.

This whole issue that it's kinda soft law, is only a problem if you have a problem with the content of the text, again, which NVA didn't seem to have untill very recently. 

And if the populations wants something that is not ""allowed"" by the pact, Parliament just needs to passes legislation so it is legal. Hard law trumps soft law, I believe.



&gt; At what point does a majority opinion become populism or democratic outcome?

~~When I agree with it~~  jk jk

When people have based their opinion on correct information, with which they were able to correctly see and assess both sides of the issue at hand.

Sadly, when it comes to controversial topics, populist tactics are the most effective to be seen as right, regardless of whether they were actually right or not. I'm just as vulnerable as the rest to these tactics.

You're saying this as if the military is the only form of employment. There are plenty of establishments suited for people with a low IQ that the free market would provide for.

That won't be the case once the UK leaves, so that is not really a good negotiation advantage

&gt;the reason the EU doesn't *want* a decent deal is purely to make an example

That seems true to a certain point, but remember that other models like the ones with Canada and Norway are seen by the UK negotiators as insuficient. The UK wants to leave the Union and also wants all of the privileges, but has a lot less to offer in return, since it's what all European countries are alone: small. The age of empire is gone

&gt;it's not like there's no one else in the world to trade to.

There is plenty of countries to trade with, but look at it from this perspective: 1/4 of the riches in the world are produced by the US, 1/4 by the EU and a little bellow 1/4 by China. That leves a bit more than 1/4 of global market activity. It represents \*all\* the other countries, mine (Brazil) included.

You are wellcome - and I know it was a next try to be sarcastic or ironic...

&gt;You don't have an argument IMO.

Argument about what?

&gt;This is a sad state - for me, I would be embarassed.

Your emotions are important for me.   You know it.

&gt;I hope you can find something with substance - instead of accusations.

What accusations - what are you talking about?

&gt;If you have it - please post below.

Ok - no problem - once again:

By the way - you accused me that I used eristic arguments.If it was a serious accusation than please try to prove your POV. If you can't then please don't use arguments that you don't understand.

yes, leaving is a right of the members, intimidating others from using it is tyrannical.

&gt;They are just looking after its own interests over the UK's.

making an example out of the UK is not in the best interest of the EU besides the intimidating effect. would you argue a bully is just defending its interest in beating someone up to make others give them money?

&gt;A UK that has shown that it doesn't care about the interests of the EU, so why should the EU care about a country's interests that doesn't care about the interests of the EU!?

1. International organizations such as the UN, OSCE, Amnesty International, the EU and the Human Rights Watch consider Russia a party to the war in Ukraine.
1. No UN member has recognized the so-called ""DPR"" as an independent state because it is seen as a puppet state of Russia.
1. Russia actively supplies the militants with weapons and supplies- to the tune of more than 2000 tanks since 2016.
1. Russia has introduced the ruble in the Donbas. Sides in a civil war do not switch to international currencies.
1. Ukrainian culture and language in the Donbas is being suppressed.

Now often times if a status quo happens the vote can be repeated after some time, often because a situation changes. BUT if its not status quo, whatever action that was called for have to actually takes place before a new vote can be proposed.

1552,"Farmers worked for subsistence and when they received monetary compensation (prior to 18th century tenant farming) it was not by virtue of owning/renting capital or through an employer-employee relationship. More importantly, the land owner in question was not subject to competition or risks like the merchants who would come to replace them. Land ownership was tied to title, it was not like owning assets as it is today.

There is something truly special about the famous example: the VOC in the Netherlands. It is the first large-scale example of the return on capital being divided into arbitrarily sized pieces, which represents a compartmentalization between a business as a legal entity, its owners an its (productive) assets. This is a defining moment in the relation between state and financial power and the catalyst for the development of capital markets.

The point isn't that capital is _owned_, every hammer is a capital asset too. The point is that it's ownership is akin to private property today: transferable, usable in any way as preferred by its owner, sole or majority ownership of profits or accumulated capital, and obviously the legal framework to protect these rights. A feudal lord is either missing or is severely limited in all of these rights.

After all that has happened to Hungary due to Fidesz, the majority of Hungarian people still supports it,am and it‚Äôs a huge amount of support for a single party - over 50% would be gigantic in any democracy. This means Fidesz has gigantic support in the society itself. And this.. makes me think some not very good things about Hungarians themselves..

It‚Äôs ridiculous that Fidesz has such support among Hungarians, and it means the Hungarian society itself is ridiculous, masochistic, shortsighted, and easily manipulated. They themselves choose the despot and mafia state to rule over them and control them.

Before you mention Poland, with its PiS - PiS is nowhere near as bad as Fidesz. Sure, it‚Äôs pretty bad, but it‚Äôs not nearly as organized and merciless in its evil, it doesn‚Äôt have huge overarching connections over every institution and bigger company in the country. Also, they don‚Äôt have 50+% support. Their support is around 35%, and the complete opposition‚Äôs support is over 50%, and the main opposition coalition‚Äôs support is around 35% too.

1700,"&gt; When talking about the lack of Apprenticeships, I would like to note that Switzerland has some 195k paid apprenticeships yearly, and Switzerland is much smaller then the UK. 

The point is that the difference with the apprenticeships is in scope. The UK, as in many other nations, has always had the apprenticeship system for traditional skills like carpentry, building, pattern making, plumbing etc. In Germany, they have an apprenticeship for everything: IT support, restaurant management, cheesemaking. You name it, they have it. The reality in the UK is that this wouldn't work because nobody has any faith in the ability of the public sector to regulate employees for the private sector. 

&gt;a flood of pseudo-academically educated people

Don't know why you'd call them pseudo-academically educated. They've all proven to some degree that they have some modicum of academic skill, although how much differs widely from institution to institution. The problem is that academic skills are not in demand in the economy. In the past, university was just a way of proving your worth that gave employers the confidence to invest in you and turn you into a useful asset. Nowadays, employers want someone who can start the job yesterday and will be working at nigh on full productivity by next week. The new deal of employer and employee relations has totally screwed that relationship. Even people with STEM skills have to work their arses off to actually get into an industry moving from theory to practice, and, in IT for example, half of the time Comp Sci grads end up working next to less qualified or even unqualified people who are self-taught and are trusted because they know how to do the job and have the track record for it. 

&gt;is the severe lack of the second sector which got lost to globalization and not the EU.

What is the point of investing in the second sector when China and Asia are taking over, and Germany, which already has all the best know-how and talent for a lot of manufacturing skills, is fighting to keep the stuff that the rest of the world doesn't trust China with (alongside Japan). 

Sounds like you're saying ""Be more like Germany"", which is clearly not a viable economic strategy when you have to compete with... well... Germany. Personally, I think moving into services was a wise choice overall because services can adapt so much faster due to less dependency on infrastructure. The real failure was not doing more to support white working class communities throughout this transition and instead shrugging them off as the hangover of a bygone age, hoping that the reaction would be that they'd all embrace Thatcher's ""aspirational society"". 

&gt; As wages increase, you either need to have a ever better functioning education/apprentice system to justify the wages with productivity (German model) or you place your factories where they still are cheap (US model). In my humble opinion, the US model is not viable.

I honestly think that neither are viable for the UK, and that the German model may not even become viable for Germany someday.  Going against the grain of globalisation is a fool's errand when you're up against billions of people in Asia who incredibly motivated to see their quality of life increase. Germany is going to have to constantly work hard to ensure that they don't slowly decline as China and other countries like Indonesia become more and more competent trading partners. The British are far more cynical these days and used to the assumption that we've already peaked. I fear what would happen in Germany if their system were ever undermined or broke down to some degree. 

&gt; The middle ground, middle class, has effectively been dropped into the lower class

Not really sure how true this is. The British middle class still command a pretty high level of wealth, and high level of purchasing power, compared to a lot of Europe. The real change is macroeconomic, with the middle class commanding less of the relative wealth of the country than before, thus making them less influential in the shaping of society. This creates a problem where although people have more access to consumables, things like property become out of the reach of more and more people because, due to limits on supply, their value always reflects the economy at large rather than the wealth of the people that actually want to live or work in those properties. Imo people aren't poorer, but they're poorer where it really matters.

1717,"&gt;EFTA doesn't negotiate anything, that's the point. The EU negotiates for them. They basically don't have a say. 

In terms of what? On the international stage it's the completely the contrary. Each EU member state has a 'common position' at meetings of WTO, The UN, The Hague and so forth. The voices of EFTA are not diluted in the same way, and therefore can express opinion on legislation that accommodates their respective nation states. 

&gt;right now they basically follow all the rules and regulations of a member without representation.

Well firstly, they certainly don't have to 'follow all the rules' as you put it. The only policy adopted in the EEA-EFTA Agreement is with respect to efficiency of the internal market, and other flanking legislation. Political policy is completely off the table at this point. There are also many examples of Norway and Iceland defying obligations set out by the commission regarding the postal service, oil, tax and the banks. 

Secondly, you should note that the EEA-EFTA Agreement accommodates for lack of voting power within the Council and Parliament. Senior figures, politicians and experts from the corresponding EFTA states are invited to the initial committees of legislation proposals to help shape them. EFTA members also maintain the right to veto legislation that they do not see fitting within the relevance of the EEA Agreement.  Whereas since the REFIT programme, less and less legislation can actually be vetoed by EU member states, as QMV has taken precedent to allow further swaths of legislation to be chundered out.

1822,"&gt;Well firstly we're assuming Kosovo is ready for EU membership so by then it would have less problems, economic or other. 

So, not before 2040? Or even ever?

&gt;As for what EU countries get, they get another country to trade intimately with. More exports and imports (which contrary to what a certain confused world leader says can be a good thing), access to Kosovar public tenders, scientific collaboration and having added Kosovo's weight to its own, the EU gains more global importance allowing to strike better terms with other countries. 

Kosovo's too small to make any real worthwhile difference in those, even if it became EU ready.

&gt;For sure those effects would be small because so is Kosovo but those are generally some of the ways the EU benefits from members. 

Well, as you, small.

&gt;The money is balanced out by the economic benefit of having it. As for the immigrants those are considered good by the government and experts (I'm not saying that all immigrants should be considered good) and bad by part of the people. However since Kosovo is so small European citizens aren't going to feel bad effects from them. 

Again, are the benefits really gonna be worthwhile considering Kosovo would certainly be the poorest EU member by far? As for the governments and some would be experts considering immigrants to be good you may simply refer to how the people responded to that idea. And yeah, Kosovo is small but it could still offload a couple hundred thousand, which would also leave it even smaller.

&gt;And it will decrease it in the further future. We already have Eastern EU countries that have gone through this process. Nowadays Czechia and even Poland have positive migration. 

Yeah, but that's not cause of them being a part of the EU but cause of the economic situation getting better, especially compared to their eastern neighbors. That won't be the case with Kosovo. It's almost certain to remain the poorest member and poorest country in the region.

&gt;Meanwhile it's some countries outside the EU that are taking the heat the most. Ukraine and Moldova are bleeding people and there's no end in sight to that. Even Bulgaria and Romania are trying to get workers from there. And as the flow of people from Eastern to Western EU slows because of economic development in Eastern EU, Western EU will double or triple their efforts to get workers from outside the union.

Again, that won't happen with Kosovo. Nobody's gonna come there besides Albanians from Albania itself.

&gt;And is Kosovo going to join the EU as part of Serbia just because some consider it so? Does Serbia pay Kosovo's bills or defend its territory with its army? Does it enforce its laws or spend its budget there? Nope. Whether we think Kosovo is part of Serbia or not, one obvious thing is that Kosovo doesn't benefit from being part of Serbia and it wouldn't directly benefit from Serbia joining the EU either.

Yes, that's the only way they're gonna join, as a part of Serbia. Didn't even Spain say something along those lines a while back? And ultimately, you think all those facts you listed interest countries? They're not gonna recognize them just cause of that or view them as independent.

That‚Äôs why I specified *modern* socialism (such as social democracy in the Nordic countries) to point out that I‚Äôm not referring to Marx‚Äô original ideas from the 19th century.

A stock market in modern socialism can be quite alright, as long as it‚Äôs well regulated, there are clear rights for workers in the country, and taxes funding welfare and so on. The stock market needs to be subject to the state and play by the state‚Äôs rules.

Really rallying protests against goverment with way more then 40% aproval rate (Poland, USA, Hungary) is democratic, not supporting goverment rallies against president with less then 20% aproval rate (Macron) is democratic , and funding ideas like open borders (in almost every country in Europe more then 60% people want better border control) and so on and on.

1936,"I'm learning both Spanish and German and there are some grammatical aspects about German that are easier than Spanish and some grammatical aspects about Spanish that are easier than German. 

German verbs are much easier to deal with in my opinion. There's less conjugation, less verb forms than both English and Spanish, many verb forms are rarely used if ever, more verbs tend to be cognates, and many verbs are formed similarly to English. For example, in both English and German you just have to use helping verbs (will, would, werde, w√ºrde, etc.) to form verb forms like future or subjunctive. There's also less irregularities than in Spanish, and many irregularities are shared with English. For example: I drink-Ich trinke, I drank-Ich trank, I have drunk-Ich habe getrunken. 

Meanwhile, in Spanish, there are so many verb forms and conjugations you need to memorize, and many verb forms aren't in English so you need to learn when to use one and when to use the other. For every verb you need to know how to conjugate into six different forms and a bunch of different tenses depending on whether it ends in -ar, -er, or -ir. Less verbs tend to be cognates in Spanish in my opinion too. Oh yeah, and then there's a shit ton of irregular conjugations, especially in tenses like the preterite. 

Noun gender in Spanish and adjective inflection is much easier though. Spanish only has two genders, and most masculine words end in -o and most feminine words end in -a, so if you don't know the gender of a noun you can just look for that and if it doesn't have an -o or -a ending there's a 50% chance you'll be right. You also only need to learn 4 different adjective endings: The masculine and feminine endings and their plural forms (which just add an s). Also, plurals in Spanish tend to be easier as you usually just have to add an s like in English.

Meanwhile, German has three genders, and most nouns don't have endings that allow you to guess the gender, so, unless you memorize the gender of each individual noun, you're guessing at about a 33% success rate, and gender also inflects adjectives as well. Oh yeah, and then there's cases, which also change and inflect articles and adjectives too, and then there's also strong, mixed, and weak inflection for adjectives depending on the article or lack of article. The amount of adjective endings you need to know when to use is insane. Also, the plural forms for German nouns take various different endings and forms and you generally need to memorize the plural forms of nouns in addition to their gender. 

Personally, I find Spanish to be overall more difficult than learning German, but that may be because I enjoy learning German more than learning Spanish. ",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/a79uq4/knowledge_of_german/ec1mjnq/,FREAK21345,1545142882

2004,"&gt; Did it though, plenty of people say that denazification was a flawed and incomplete process whose end was precipitated by the start of the cold war. The german elite which was overwhelmingly affiliated with the nazis still kept it's social position until the 70s esp atop big political parties like CDU.

Mh. We only had one Chancellor with Nazi affiliation, which was Kiesinger. Adenauer was imprisoned during the nazi regime (he was also the guy who opened the first Autobahn, before hitler btw), Brandt spent the time of Nazi Germany in exile, Schmidt fought as a Wehrmacht officer in Russia, but did not have nazi party affiliation. 

Yes, the structure of our courts, authorities and government still included a lot of former nazis, but establishing a state without them would not have been possible, there wouldn't have been enough personnel and expertise otherwise. What matters is that those people either stopped believing in that ideology after WW II, refrained from trying to implement it again or were hindered from doing so. The establishment of ""liberal"" institution like our constitutional court really helped a lot as well. 

&gt; My point is, I don't think foreign powers were able to root out german authoritarianism, at least by occupation. Germans did it themselves.

If the allied leaders hadn't taken an approach that allowed for western and european integration of Germany, and credit especially goes to france in this regard, I think we would be a worse country today.

2053,"Germany‚Äôs Misunderstood Trade Surplus

Mar 7, 2017 MARCEL FRATZSCHER

The ongoing debate about Germany‚Äôs current-account surplus ‚Äì which has now set a new record ‚Äì has been counterproductive, and is based on three common fallacies. Criticism of Germany‚Äôs export prowess, and accusations of currency manipulation, are just as wrong-headed as Germany‚Äôs own defense of its bloated surplus.

BERLIN ‚Äì Now that Germany‚Äôs current-account surplus has reached a record ‚Ç¨270 billion ($285 billion), or close to 8.7% of GDP, the ongoing debate about its economic model has intensified. Eurozone politicians and Donald Trump‚Äôs administration in the United States are each blaming the other for the economic imbalance; and all are blaming the euro.

Trump‚Äôs administration, for its part, has attacked Germany for exporting too much, and accused it of manipulating the euro. In fact, Germany‚Äôs trade surplus has little to do with the euro; which has become a convenient scapegoat ‚Äì a stand-in for other policy mistakes.

Many Germans view the latest wave of criticism as a sign that others are merely envious of their country‚Äôs success, and they have angrily refuted arguments that Germany has tried to gain an unfair competitive advantage. Germany, they point out, does not engage in price dumping or direct export promotion, and its leaders do not target the euro.

On the contrary, prior to adopting the common currency, Germany had for decades pursued a strong-Deutsche Mark policy, because it wanted to encourage domestic exporters to maintain competitiveness through innovation, rather than reliance on the exchange rate. This was the central feature of Germany‚Äôs economic model after World War II, and the main reason its long Wirtschaftswunder (‚Äúeconomic miracle‚Äù) could be sustained.

The criticism of Germany‚Äôs trade surplus suffers from three fallacies. For starters, many of the critics seem to believe that Germany‚Äôs trade balance can be systematically manipulated with the exchange rate. But, owing to the integration of global value chains, industrial exports now comprise many imported inputs, which means that the effect of exchange-rate movements on domestic prices and the trade balance has decreased substantially over time.

In fact, Germany‚Äôs bilateral trade surplus with the US has barely changed, despite substantial swings in the euro-dollar exchange rate ‚Äì which was as high as ‚Ç¨1:$1.60 in 2011, and as low as ‚Ç¨1:$1.04 more recently. Germany owes its export success not to currency manipulation, but to its strong market position and the pricing power of its highly specialized manufacturing champions.

A second fallacy is the belief that politicians and central banks can actually set exchange rates. In most advanced economies, the exchange rate cannot simply be decreed; rather, it is endogenously determined by the underlying real economy and the state of the financial system. Currency markets are too deep for direct intervention to be worth the risk, as the Swiss National Bank discovered a few years ago when it tried to stem the franc‚Äôs appreciation. The US Treasury abandoned currency-market interventions in the 1990s; and the European Central Bank has tried to intervene only once, very briefly in 2000.

Accusations that the US Federal Reserve and the ECB have pursued unconventional policy measures to weaken their respective currencies miss the fact that exchange-rate movements have only a limited, short-lived effect on domestic inflation, exports, and growth. Both central banks are guided by their mandates, not by an implicit or explicit exchange-rate objective.

A third fallacy ‚Äì which one often encounters on the German side of the debate ‚Äì is the belief that a country‚Äôs current-account balance reflects the competitiveness of its exports. In reality, a country‚Äôs external balance is determined by its preferences and its intertemporal saving and investment decisions. Fundamentals such as Germany‚Äôs demographics alone probably account for only about three percentage points ‚Äì or one-third ‚Äì of its current-account surplus.

As these three fallacies show, the debate over Germany‚Äôs external surplus should not be about the euro exchange rate or German exports. The euro is not too weak, and German exports are not too high. Rather, the problem is that Germany‚Äôs imports are too low, owing to its huge investment gap.

Germany has one of the lowest public-investment rates in the industrialized world. Its municipalities, which are responsible for half of all public investment, currently have unrealized investment projects worth ‚Ç¨136 billion, or 4.5% of GDP; Germany‚Äôs school buildings alone need another ‚Ç¨35 billion for repairs. Meanwhile, private investment in Germany‚Äôs aging capital stock has been weakened by many German companies‚Äô desire to invest abroad.

The gap is the result of policy failures ‚Äì namely protectionist policies in the non-tradable services sector. The International Monetary Fund, the European Commission, and the OECD have long tried to convince Germany to deregulate services, curtail vested interests, and improve competition. But, as it stands, wages, productivity, and investment remain high in the German export sector, and low in the non-tradable services sector.

The international debate about Germany‚Äôs current account should thus focus on measures to liberalize the country‚Äôs services and remove other barriers to investment. To that end, Germany should improve its digital and transportation infrastructure; strengthen market mechanisms to encourage more renewable-energy development; address its shortage of skilled labor; change its tax system to strengthen incentives to invest; and reform its regulations to reduce uncertainty.

Germany is an increasingly important political and economic power in Europe and on the world stage. But, until now, the debate about Germany‚Äôs current-account surplus has been counterproductive. Criticism of Germany‚Äôs export prowess, and accusations of currency manipulation, are just as wrong-headed as Germany‚Äôs own defense of its excessive surplus. Ultimately, Germany can serve everyone‚Äôs best interests ‚Äì including its own ‚Äì by reducing its surplus, and thus the harmful economic imbalances that lie just beneath the surface.",,/r/europe/comments/a7akqv/germanys_misunderstood_trade_surplus_by_marcel/ec1getw/,Djngrndk,1545135798

One thing that can happen is if USA decides to sanction Russian gas for whatever reason and Germany does not want to follow.

Elected supreme judge in Poland is an independent as in Germany it seems. The current controversy comes from the weird way the constitution describes the retirement age: it is to be set by a normal bill. The ruling party has ruthlessly exploited it and changed the bill; thus making some of the current judges exceeding it and shortening their term. As reprehensible as it is, the law allows it.

Before wording a strong opinion about changes in Poland, we should wait for the EU Court of Justice ruling. 

In my opinion the ruling party is just using tricks and being cheeky, while all they would have to do would be reforming the justice system to resemble german solutions. It seems it works well and would achieve exactly the same results as they chase.

That being said, the justice system in Poland is absolutely in need of changes, even opposition confirms that. Current system is totally ineffective and unparalled (in europe) independence of judges creates a lot of pathologies, like literal dynasties of judges, simple cases lasting decades and absolutely unnacceptable, from the society point of view, rulings.",,/r/europe/comments/a77p2k/poland_reinstates_supreme_court_judges_following/ec1c5n5/,Spirit_Inc,1545128622

2246,"&gt; Getting more seats than the ratio of the elected vote is normal in a country, which has more than two parties. It's in the constitution of most EU countries.

And the opposition got less seats than the votes they got. I guess this is also normal, and is nothing that should be fixed.

&gt; You have a problem with Hungarians outside Hungary voting?

I wasn't really clear about this, so let me rephrase. Hungarians, who wanted to vote by mail, were met with hardships - they received the mails too late, etc. Those, who were living just over the border could vote easily. Especially considering many of them were carried by organized bus services, and they were given hungarian citizenship by the gov't. And they received a lot of promises from Viktor Orban, so it was easy to convince them. They never lived in Hungary? All the better, they are not affected by the negative things, so why not vote the one who made the best promises.

&gt; Judiciary independence meant the judges had no oversight and were chosen from among themselves by themselves. 

Now Fidesz basically has control over who sits there. Basically the last independent branch of power has started to merge into Fidesz.

&gt; If you want to prove elections were fraudulent, do it.

Here's the thing. If we look at the law, the election didn't break any of it. But if we look at the changes made to the constitution, we can see that each of them was made to help Fidesz win. Other things were just ""oversights"", but far too many. Look at all the things I listed above, and you can see these are questionable practices to say the least. And they *barely* got the 2/3 this way. The opposition's weakness must also be mentioned, they are just as guilty as the ruling party, but this doesn't mean Fidesz did nothing wrong. (Oh, and there are even more things I left out, like ""forgetting"" to cross out candidates who backed out, or that valasztas.hu (""election.hu"") died a lot on the day of the election, etc.) There were so many things wrong, that all the minuscule advantages added up to just enough advantage to turn a relative majority into an absolute one.",,/r/europe/comments/a6ywvf/budapest_hu_opposition_representatives_demand_of/ec187w4/,nulloid,1545121544

Additionally, things like snap elections are different because they are decided by the winning side. A 2nd referendum now would be like having new elections before the winning party/coalition even had a chance to form a government.

It is anti-democratic, in democracies people exercise power by voting, you want to ignore a decision (vote) made by the people, hence it being anti-democratic.

2289,"&gt; Separation of state and church doesn't work if a foreign government has heavy influence on the church. 

If a foreign government has too much influence on the church, then it is the responsibility of the local church chapters and their members to force a change or to sever the connection to the parent body. The government in my opinion should stay out of it.

The same is true for Germany, we have issues with the Islamic federation Ditib, because it is controlled from Turkey with allegations of spying being present. But it's not the job of the German government to inject itself into church internal matters. If an entity is actually guilty of spying for outside actors, then you should simply ban that entity, even if it is a church.

There‚Äôs no need for political parties today by that logic, and yet they still exist.

They are originally from Ingushetia but live in Susuman, a gold-mining town on the route between Magadan and Yakutsk - the [""Kolyma"" highway, aka ""the Road of Bones""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R504_Kolyma_Highway). 

The first time they met him during the day, when he was cycling by the side of the road. They asked/gestured if he needs help and offered a lift to the closest town, but he refused. (Not sure if they even understood each other, because Jose speaks zero Russian. The level of preparation is off the scale.)

In the evening it got dark, and the wind started (in addition to that -50C). Jose got extremely fatigued and could not move further. To make it much worse, there was no one on the road during the night\*. So he decided to sleep (fortunately right by the roadside) in his *summer* tent. 

These nice men thought about him freezing to death, so they asked around if anyone saw a cyclist. Because no one did, they drove back along the road and found his tent. They feared the worst but he was still alive (though already half-coherent and frostbitten).

\* There is a reason why people in this region try do not drive at night in -50C even if they have good cars that fit the climate. If anything breaks down, you have only a few hours before you die from hypothermia. Burning each tire adds ~1-2 hours of life - if you can dismount them. Some keep extra old tires in the car just in case. This is also why not stopping to help the car or man in distress is extremely frowned upon, even though in 1990s it carried a good chance of being carjacked/killed by the bandits. However, the bandits that tried that also did not have long or happy lives. *""Taiga is the law, and the bear is the boss""* [*""–¢–∞–π–≥–∞ - –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω, –º–µ–¥–≤–µ–¥—å - —Ö–æ–∑—è–∏–Ω""*], as they say.

Poached ivory would be destroyed yet antique ivory would be safe. Alongside a regulated market I‚Äôd propose more support at the source, more funding, equipment for the people‚Äôs whose job it is to protect these animals. 

I think recent history has shown that simply making something illegals looks good but doesn‚Äôt always solve the issue.

2673,"None that affect undergraduate university admissions. There are ""contextual admissions"" which will take into consideration how well-off the student's school is, but that would have the opposite effect you are expecting (it would increase the proportion FSM students in higher education).

Funding for state schools across the country is in a dire state. Naturally, schools in more peripheral towns, which is where most of the white working class live, struggle even further. The Conservative government since 2010 has attempted to deal with this by selling off schools, or turning them into academies (which lets them be funded by external benefactors, but also gives an excuse to slash their state funding), but this frequently results in their finances being further mismanaged and are unable to deliver the quality of the education they need.

Because this essentially being going on for the last four decades since Thatcher came to power in 1979, it has also developed into a cultural reality. As high-equality education has increasingly been distanced from white working class, families, they in turn have viewed it less favourably, and are generally less likely to push their kids into higher education. 

The inverse cultural factor is that immigrant families - generally anywhere in the Western world, but nonetheless in Britain too -- value education highly and see it as a vehicle for their own social mobility.

This ""tech"" tax is an arbitrary tax on revenue (as opposed to profits) on tech companies. It doesn't make a lot of sense. 

* It would tax revenue, not income. This is silly. An online retailer can earn 3% to 6% net margin, whereas a software company can earn upwards of 20%. A 4% tax on revenue would be the equivalent of 100% corporate income tax rate for a retailer and 25% corporate income tax rate for a software company. You're taxing one four times higher than the other. Why?

* It's a tax on tech companies to avoid shenanigans that are available to literally hundreds of thousands of other businesses. 

* We have a broad tax proposal which, if combined with restrictions on expensing non-EU R&amp;D/intellectual property, would perfectly tax these companies. It even has more support!

- We're not talking a bar, we're talking a country with 47 million people.

- The top labour wages (which are the ones generally used for these comparisons) are nowhere remotely as high as you might think they are, people who have a lot of money don't get their huge earnings in day-job paychecks.

If they wanted they could have already gone to the ECHR long ago. But they can't expect the busiest Court in Spain (who doesn't have the privilege to simply deny with no motivation the appeals like the Supreme Court of the US can) to solve everything they throw in a single week. The trial is coming close and they need to put up a show. But even the people in the seccessionism know that this is just an act to get attention:

2724,"Although the history books went on with the safer line of ''revolution'', anyone who uses his/her brain realizes this was most likely just another coup staged by foreign secret services. More and more evidence lead to that conclusion.  Both the eastern (USSR) and western (USA) wanted the most opressive communist regime in Europe gone. The west cause it wanted to bring democracy and its own interests in a soviet influence area and the soviets because Ceausescu was a nationalist that was insubordonate towards Moscow.

The attempt to remove the priest Laszlo Tokes, a known traitor working for the hungarian secret service, was used to ignite the coup in Timisoara. According to several testimonies of people working at the top of  the Securitatea and other romanian services, both the hungarian and russian secret services were active in Romania in those days. The hungarian ones mostly in Timisoara while the russian ones in Bucharest. There were many soviet ''tourists'' those days. Although some of the high ranking officers knew months before that something big is cooking, they kept  Ceausescu in the dark and made everything possible, being complices with the foreign secret services like KGB, GRU, MI6, etc. Most of them were controlled by the soviets. The decision to execute the Ceausescus was taken far before everything started.

Iliescu and Roman were the successors wanted by Moscow and their link with the soviets was Silviu Brucan (real name Saul Bruckner, jewish born in Romania), another product of the USSR secret services, that was constantly visiting Moscow, idealizing communism and the USSR and even asked for the execution of communist disidents back in the day. He was just one of the romanian jews that fancied communism before WW2 (when it was irrelevant in Romania), idealizing USSR, becoming a KGB tool and betraying his own country over his communist ideals. Ana Pauker (real name  Hana Rabinsohn) and Valter Roman (the father of Petre Roman, future prime minister of Romania; real name Erno Neulander) are 2 other examples of traitors that fled to Moscow before WW2 and only came back with the soviet tanks, as leaders of the communist movement imposed in Romania.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/a733ef/today_29_years_ago_the_revolution_that_would_end/ec0908y/,vladgrinch,1545085288

Yeah. Those areas we left behind. But that's because of their economic irrelevance. Dublin, Paris, Tokyo, various cities across world are doing exactly what London is doing. Its a global phenomenon that's just following industrial revolution trends: Cities are more economically viable than rural areas, and as such, attract investment.

The ""economic anxiety"" bollox is just a smokescreen for genuine racism most of the time. Sure, these areas have been neglected. And they shouldn't be. But if you want that, you want state controlled economies. That's incompitable with the free market that institutions like the EU are built upon. You cannot have both. You'd think brexit would be coming from the far left if that was truly the source of people's anguish but its not.

I'm with you mostly anyway. The EU is in need of reform and soon. It's currently a clusterfuck. Brexit is evident of that. I think Yanis Varafakous is right in the money with his Diem 25.

Spain and Italy are really far worse, also german/French dubbing is actually somewhat decent, while eastern Europe employs some of the worst tricks. 

Point in Case: Mostly not as good as original audiotrack but possibly the best dubbing industry in the world and still high english proficiency (in Germany at least, France is also still better than their southern romance neighbours). I don't think Germany/France are really the black sheep. 

Apart from that dubbing has probably less of an impact than just lingual proximity.

Maybe we can be generous here and say that with the economy being in deep shit, most of people needed to be fired, and so they chose to fire the Albanians who were majority. Or maybe, it was just another tool on making the lives as miserable as possible for Albanians (together with closing of schools, universities, systematic beatings of young people, martial law etc) in order for Albanians to leave Kosovo.

On a personal note, my father was fired in 1990 together with all Albanian workers in a factory. He was actually vice administrator of the factory so hardly a low skilled employee who just got fired cause the factory was having problems. The factory continued working.

2895,"&gt;We all know what Peter Said means, and you mean the same thing.

Considering you entirely misrepresented Peter and myself (given that I don't have a opinion of if he is right or wrong), apparently not.

&gt;""the homogenisation of a identity is disadvantageous""  
&gt;  
&gt;That's what an identity is. That's what a nation is.

Identities are not homogenous, to be Spanish is clearly not homogenous, to be German is neither (Given some identify to a degree by the State). Oh look and Italy has regional differences as well. This is likewise in other places. Not every person of a identity has to have the same opinion, or be of the same race etc. to share that identity. Hell he points to United States, or Australia and New Zealand as examples, still strong viable countries with there own identity without being homogenous. Allowing others to become apart of your identity - making it not homogenous, will not destroy it.

&gt;You say that's not his intention, but it's like you are saying ""It's only manslaughter, not murder... I didn't mean to kill him when I shot him""

This is a spacious analogy which is entirely without merit.

&gt;It's ok wipe out an indigenous people and destroy their ethnic identity via mass immigration as long as there is the possibility of the GDP rising .5%. Fuck the environment, let's create more pollution and use up more resources while breeding native people out of existence. Native people can't do certain jobs.

See he isn't in favour of this occur and none of it is occurring. So you can't accuse him of accidentally letting it happen, allowing it to happen, or causing it. Second if any of it did occur he might well be against such immigration, given that the article seems focused on controlled immigration particularly in high skilled areas (the article is predominantly talking about students, and academic staff - not mass immigration).

So again I say that you entirely misrepresented him. Never do anything requiring academic integrity, because you don't have any. ",,/r/europe/comments/a6qwmr/brussels_protest_over_un_pact_turns_violent_bbc/ec00eyq/,SavageJunk,1545078894

Dude you got really offended on the childish part, so let me make things clearer. Its not childish to protest, its not childish to fight for what you feel is right.  Childish are the politicians that we expect to make a change. 
As i said try imagining an other group of people trying to break in in the news station and read their demans. Imagine a group of minorities doing the same. You would be applauding that these radical people were stopped by a building security. Again, in what European country does storming a news statiom with your demands is met with serious respect and the heed for changes were met?

Im sorry but its turning into a rant from me. But please, the the oposition is minority to Fidesz no? Fidesz won. Maybe it would be better to win back votes with reason, because this is just making Fidesz supporters more confident in the party.  I feel like the left and the right in this country are now the most disconnected, and hating, screaming, trying to take over news station will not persuade grandma from the village to change her vote. I do not expect you to answer this nor anyone. This is what politicians would have to do, in my opinion, hence why I called this action of storming the building childish, since it only reinforces the main parties belfies in grandma.

Nope, the mother church is indeed Constantinople, since it was never transferred to the ROC in the first place, but only temporarily placed under its administration for contemporary practical reasons. Hence, as I already said, the Patriarch of Constantinople can unilaterally grant autocephaly and does not need any of his lesser equals to agree.

To address the other point. We don't live in a normal democracy. I don't think you understand how unlikely it is that the opposition will ever win an election under the current system. Not only is the election process rigged, fidesz has a 100 times bigger budget and about 90% of the country's media under it's arms as well as judges. The opposition is silenced at every step, this isn't the United States where the opposition can build up with a good campaign and candidates, grandmas don't listen to reason when they watch M1. You expect the opposition to work reasonably in an unreasonable environment where everything is unfavorably turned against them. I actually think people like you who can't see how fucked the current situation is are keeping it alive to a degree.

3200,"&gt; The days of unions fighting for the common good are long gone. They are just another lobby organisation fighting for their members and fuck everyone else.

heh good luck with this statement on a European subreddit!

I actually do think we're going to need unions again, since workers' rights are going down the toilet with the √úber/Foodora/etc. model (or temp agencies for white collar work) but both my experiences with unions do match what you are saying.

Case 1: the teacher's union in Ontario protects a lot of extremly useless and bad teachers, which led to damage to my education when I was in school. They even fought against evaluating teachers, which happens in pretty much every workplace ever. As a result, you cannot be fired from being a teacher, even if you don't do your job at all (and I've heard worse stories I can't list here).

Second case is when I was forced into a union while working at the grocery store in high school. This union made a lot of sense for the small minority of people working there for life, because it had secured guaranteed wage increases. However, the overwhelming majority of workers were temporary, people who were studying or otherwise planning to move on within a few years or less. I calculated my union fees vs. my wage increases and found it came out about even. So, yes, this union was profitting for themselves. Oh yeah and I worked with a lot of lazy people who couldn't be fired from our unionized store.

I'm not against unions in general and, liike I said, we're going to need them again, but I think you are right that there are a lot of unions out there who are looking to fill their own pockets, in the same way that any people in power try to do. However, I do think German unions seem to have a better respect for the company than North American ones.",Canadian / German,/r/europe/comments/a6yh95/german_union_calls_strike_at_amazon_warehouses/ebz1ulu/,matttk,1545049068

A vote to leave ought to have a high threshold because re-joining is a potentially many year long process where all existing members have a veto, and so the potential damage of making the wrong decision is massive.

Such decisions also ought to include a clear process for triggering votes to potentially reverse the decision after set amounts of time, not be left up to parliament.

The problem would be setting out a process to objectively assess the risks to determine the threshold without said process getting heavily politicised.

3281,"&gt; the 2016 polls were accurate within the normal margin of error

Exit polls are accurate. Survey polls are much less reliable. The 2016 referendum was around a 50/50 split swinging backwards and forwards for the weeks building up to the referendum because it was incredibly close. People did not know which way to vote because of the sheer amount of misinformation. 

You referenced the 2016 polls being accurate when only 55/168 online polls conducted before the referendum predicted the correct result - let alone percentages. You then go on to say the result was within the margin of error - which is silly given how close the split was, staying around the bounds of 50/50 for months prior to the referendum leading all the way up to it. The vote was so close that obviously most polls would be within their standard error. 

https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/how-eu-referendum-pollsters-wrong-opinion-predict-close

Now first off whilst I do believe polls are complete shite, youre taking my use of 'landslide' too far. Imo any result hitting near enough 60% in favour of one side would be a landslide. 

Polls aside, over the last year or so we have had close to no solid arguments for a brexit. We have seen our government and opposition meltdown over their opinions on brexit. We have seen forecasts of potential futures outside of the Union which were not visible prior to the referendum. The sheer amount of evidence bearing against leave is overwhelming at the current moment in time. Comparing the current vote to the prior vote with the notion that remain will win is silly. The context has entirely changed with the factors leading me to believe that remain would easily win being completely novel. 

We can talk about irrational biases but that takes the presumption that most voters on this matter gave a terrible shit which way the result went. The average person in the electorate gives a shit about what happens to their wallet, and nothing else.

I would also make voting for a referendum mandatory. All adults should vote for it to reflect the intent of the people. If you didn't vote for a referendum, you should be fined as you are not fulfilling your duties as a citizen. 


Enforcing a referendum like Brexit with such low participation should be illegal. First, it doesn't represent a majority of the population. Second, as a government, shouldn't you need to address why so many people is not voting for a fucking referendum? Maybe they don't have access to polling stations? Access to information to do the proper research? Maybe they simply don't give a fuck? Why? Do they understand what is at stake? If so many adults in your country don't understand the importance of a referendum... You need to address and solve that first.

On average fiscal adjustment based upon spending cuts have very small output costs and in some cases they are expansionary.

&gt; If the UK upsets the balance in an organisation that only negotiates trade deals and does not envisage political integration, surely joining the EU would be so much worse? It's a bigger balance upset and in more important matters. 

EFTA doesn't negotiate anything, that's the point. The EU negotiates for them. They basically don't have a say. That's why common sense would be for EFTA members to join the EU, right now they basically follow all the rules and regulations of a member without representation. Their position is honestly beyond stupid, whether you like the EU or not this is a terrible place to be. At least people who are anti-EU in France, the Netherlands, Poland or still the UK for a short while could elect MPs like Farage to voice their opposition. Norwegians just have to apply what Brussels decided.

&gt; She says it will upset the balance between EFTA and the EU, as if it's a bad thing.

She said the UK will upset the balance *within* EFTA. The UK would be a behemoth compared to the rest of the members combined. I mean honestly, if you're from Iceland or Liechtenstein, would you believe the UK will listen to your voice as an equal partner? Of course not.

&gt;""Estonia also stands out for the high number of *alcohol-related* deaths: 21.4 percent of all casualties.""

Also, I *really* question this line. You can go to www.stat.ee and look up stats on causes of deaths. In 2012 there were 15,450 deaths. Of that 3,702 were neoplasms (cancer) (C00 - D48) and 8,357 were diseases of the circulatory system (I00 - I99). [Source: stat.ee](http://pub.stat.ee/px-web.2001/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=PO57&amp;ti=DEATHS+BY+CAUSE+OF+DEATH%2C+SEX+AND+AGE+GROUP+PER+100%2C000+POPULATION&amp;path=../I_Databas/Population/03Vital_events/06Deaths/&amp;lang=1)

(8357 + 3702) / 15450 = 0.78

Or in other words, 78% of deaths were basically heart disease and cancer. It's true that alcohol contributes to both of these, but considering the numbers are similar in other countries that seems a bit far fetched.

Now, another thing to keep in mind is that most people who died in 2012 lived a large chunk (most) of their lives even before the re-independence of Estonia, which means that the current policies aren't even involved to a large degree.",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/a6nzsr/international_tourist_arrivals_per_capita_in/ebyczpn/,Aerroon,1545014553
3752,"Actually, she is very wrong. Here is why. 

 1. Everyone of the four red lines she cited are not red lines for the vast majority of MPs in parliament. (edit: That majority increases even more if it's for a proposed transition deal and even more again if a sitting government supports it.)

 2. She says she wouldn't want to let the UK in as it would upset the balance. However she is the president for the Norwegian European movement that advocates for Norway to join the EU fully. If the UK upsets the balance in an organisation that only negotiates trade deals and does not envisage political integration, surely joining the EU would be so much worse? It's a bigger balance upset and in more important matters. 

 3. The above point makes it blindingly obvious that she is just trying to get into the EU's good books and maybe even helping to engineer the UK remaining in the EU. She is after all a mere backbencher, no one really significant. Where as the Icelandic foreign minister has come out in support of the UK joining EFTA/EEA. 

 4. Don't forget keeping smooth trade between Norway and the UK, is good for Norway, it's good for Norway if we remain in the EEA. She is clearly being dishonest about her intentions. 

 5. She says it will upset the balance between EFTA and the EU, as if it's a bad thing. How is that a bad thing? Giving more power to EFTA (and by extension, Norway) is somehow bad. It's almost as if she isn't being honest, as explained above. 

 6. Finally the point about ""messing it up"" was not an argument at all. This interview is obviously staged for the purpose of discrediting the EEA/EFTA option. The loaded question from the interviewer makes that perfectly evident.

The problem is that both the president and supreme court judges are picked by the parliament. The parliament can also change the constitution with 2/3. 

So when Orban got 2/3 he changed the constitution, picked his own president, and lowered the retirement age of constitutional judges, and changed the election law.

-

&gt; Criticism started after a feasibility study by AECOM was published

-

&gt;In 2017 several Estonian environmental groups claimed that the lack of public participation on the decision made by Baltic governments and building of a new line, rather than upgrading the existing network, is in conflict with the Aarhus Convention.

-

&gt;The Estonian Association for the Club of Rome advised the government to abandon the Rail Baltica route.

-

&gt;Problems in the environmental assessment programme have also been claimed.

-

&gt;In 2016 and 2017, three open letterswere composed in Estonia by public persons including scientists, academics, and architects who called on the Estonian government and parliament to stop the project in its planned form. The main arguments in these letters were that the new track as a greenfield project will cause too much damage to nature and does not essentially improve the travelling possibilities.

-

&gt;On 8 June 2017, Priit Humal, Karli Lambot, Illimar Paul and Raul Vibo, experts on logistics and engineering, published a critical analysis of the Rail Baltica Cost-Benefit Analysis made by EY where they claimed that ‚Ç¨4.1 billion of the stated socio-economic benefits are faulty and therefore the Rail Baltica project is neither feasible nor eligible for the EU financing.

-

&gt;On 16 January 2018, Priit Humal, Karli Lambot, Illimar Paul and Raul Vibo published a 73-page study that includes replies from EY, RB RAIL AS and the European Commission. The authors of the study claim that issues raised in their previous analysis were not adequately addressed in the official replies, and that therefore Rail Baltica will be detrimental to society.

There's a handful of Finno-Ugric languages, some diversity in far Eastern Europe (the Caucasus, Urals, the Pontic Steppe, etc), Maltese is Semitic, and some Turks, but otherwise it's pretty uniform‚Äîexcept for Basque.

Basque is the only surviving pre-Indo-European language west of Russia, bar arguably some of the Finno-Ugric languages in Fennoscandia. Spanish, French, Aragonese, and other nearby languages are all much more closely related to Hindi, Persian, and Armenian than they are to Basque, whose only known relatives are long-dead neighbors. It provides the best glimpse we have of European language and non-material culture before the arrival of the Indo-Europeans from the east, the last survivor of many ancient cultures and languages.

It's got a lot of loan words from, and has even borrowed some grammatical features from and adapted most of its sounds to, the romance languages, so at times it can sound just like a highly divergent Spanish relative, but it's really totally different. People often try to connect it with languages across the globe, often proposing a pre-Indo-European family that once stretched across Eurasia, some proposals even grouping it with Native American languages, notably the Den√© languages like Navajo. But it's really just so unique that no one can say if it has any distant cousins, despite being by far the most studied language isolate on Earth thanks to its position in Western Europe.

4051,"Depends on your definition of ""better"". In my definition it's definitely getting worse, and the trends are obvious: middle class is shrinking, all branches of power are controlled by putin (unlike 90-s, where there was literary a fight between parliament run by communists and Yeltsin's government), all media are now in control, the economy is gradually sinking without any hope for structural changes. 

I mean, yeah, you can compare it to the times when the oil cost $10, but it wouldn't be an honest comparison, and the result of putin's rule will be a great calamity (just as the result of Brezhnev's rule).

As for russian people, they do not like putin or government in general, and are not happy with their living standards, which are gradually decreasing.

Oh piss off, I said nothing about historical geography and historical impact at all.

&gt;Point is we as EU defeating ourselves on immigration issue with our policies and na√Øvety. We could stop these boats with fraction of the effort we must muster now.

Regarding the third one: Parliament has exactly the same problem with reaching a majority as the general population. There simply is no clear, non marginal majority for any option at this point. So this will lead to a situation where, after weeks of strongly polarized debate before such a second referendum, a lot of people will feel they have lost. Things will be particularly bad if Remain wins by a small margin (which is the most likely outcome). Brexiteers will not see the result of the second referendum as a result of democracy, but as denial of democracy because they will feel betrayed since their vote in the first referendum was overturned.

4436,"\&gt;  Not all power comes from veto. 

That's why it was vital to discuss how the entire structure of the EU emphasises equal representation per member state. Despite what the UK tabloids tell you, EU legislation is not some arcane process conducted in dark corners. The process is well defined in the treaties that founded the EU in its modern form. Germany cannot decide one day to walk in with a piece of legislation and say ""we are voting on this"" like a national government can. The Commision, in which again every member is represented in equal proportion, proposes legislation. Even that legislation has to be justified given the long-term planning of the EU and every member can ask for consultation and so on. Every piece of this is public.

The fact that soft power is limited by EU legislation by design is evident in the whole Brexit negotiation. UK huffs and puffs and threatens that if they don't get the deal they want they'll drag everyone down! Ireland will have no medication or foodstuffs! The Polish residing in the EU will be deported en masse! Obvious attempts of fearmongering with the goal to undermine the unity of the opposing multi-party side and get a better deal. And it did not work. Another example: The public opinion in Germany, most of CDU politicians and as their champion Schauble the finance minister of Germany at the time all leaned towards not extending the Greek bailout. Fiscal austerity for members that fail to meet debt to gdp ratio goals is a major point for the German foreign policy. Yet a compromise was found and the bailout extended.

You say: 

\&gt;  I never said any countries consistently aligned with the UK. 

Your original post reads:

\&gt;   Some countries actually agreed with the UK on many things

Aren't those two statements contradictory?

Then again you say:

\&gt;  I don't want to present an argument, but two paragraphs is a lot for a post with no content.  

And in the very next sentence:

\&gt;   I wasn't saying your view was invalid 

So the post explaining my view was without purpose according to you, which of course would diminish the validity of the argument. And on the next sentence you say ""I am not saying your view is invalid"". 

Then again, you make a sad attempt at ad hominem:

\&gt;   But hey, I guess you really can't take people having a dissenting view... Sad for someone who claims they care about community and bringing people together.

4497,"Anyone interested in how the male and female ideal has changed throughout the history of mankind should read Camille Paglia's Sexual Personae.

Here is an excerpt regarding [Venus of Willendorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_of_Willendorf), a [little figurine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_of_Willendorf#/media/File:Venus_von_Willendorf_01.jpg) not unlike the one in OP's picture dated 30000BC.

&gt;The Venus of Willendorf is comically named, for she is unbeautiful by every standard. But beauty has not yet emerged as a criterion for art. In the Old Stone Age, art is magic, a ritual recreation of what-is-desired. Cave paintings were not meant to be seen. Their beauty for us is incidental. Bison and reindeer crowd the walls, following rock ridges and grooves. Art was invocation, a summoning: mother nature, let herds return that man might eat. Caves were the bowels of the goddess, and art was a sexual scribbling, an impregnation. It had rhythm and vitality but no visual status. The Venus of Willendorf, a cult-image half-molded from a rough stone, is unbeautiful because art has not yet found its relation to the eye. Her fat is a symbol of abundance in an age of famine. She is the too-muchness of nature, which man longs to direct to his salvation.

&gt;Venus of Willendorf carries her cave with her. She is blind, masked. Her ropes of corn-row hair look forward to the invention of agriculture. She has a furrowed brow. Her facelessness is the impersonality of primitive sex and religion. There is no psychology or identity yet, because there is no society, no cohesion. Men cower and scatter at the blast of the elements. Venus of Willendorf is eyeless because nature can be seen but not known. She is remote even as she kills and creates. The statuette, so overflowing and protuberant, is ritually invisible. She stifles the eye. She is the cloud of archaic night. 

&gt;Bulging, bulbous, bubbling. Venus of Willendorf, bent over her own belly, tends the hot pot of
nature. She is eternally pregnant. She broods, in all senses. She is hen, nest, egg. The Latin mater and materia, mother and matter, are etymologically connected. Venus of Willendorf is the nature-mother as primeval muck, oozing into infant forms. She is female but not feminine. She is turgid with primal force, swollen with great expectations. She has no feet. Placed on end, she would topple over. Woman is immobile, weighed down by her inflated mounds of breast, belly, and buttock. Like Venus de Milo, Venus of Willendorf has no arms. They are flat flippers scratched on the stone, unevolved, useless. She has no thumbs and therefore no tools. Unlike man, she can neither roam nor build. She is a mountain that can be climbed but can never move.

There are no European ethnic values that include everyone from hardcore christians on farms to atheist gays but excludes immigrants I hope you realize that. You don't even know what you are talking about when you say values. You're just differentiating people based on ethnicity and saying that one is wrong for us without any reason or proper evidence, it's like you've never met an American before whose grandparents were Iranian or Persian immigrants or whatever and now their grandson is just like any other American, but their skin is a little darker oh no. As I said in another comment, if 500-1000 years later the majority of Hungarians won't be white I won't give a shit, why would I? At that point they have lived here for enough time, they were born here, they helped to grow the country, they speak the language and know the traditions, they are just as Hungarian as me, fucking skin color doesn't matter to me nor does religion, if they are integrated they will be atheists or agnostic soon enough anyway. I don't support illegal immigration, I like the idea if dispersing immigrants and especially refugees so they don't form ghettos, I don't support fucking going around on the street with your face hidden. I never supported the ""open borders"" shit that Merkel did. **I just think you can allow immigration to a point where all immigrants can be properly integrated into society and it also helps to boost the economy (there is an AND statement there, I'm not contradicting anything)**. That's my view. I don't think there is anything wrong with that, it's not even in any way radical.

If you want to live in an ethnostate just grow some balls and say it and skip this whole arguing part, it's fucking painful. Just say that you want no immigration and you're willing to accept that economically your country will be in shit and will die out with it's culture anyway but at least it stood """"""""pure"""""""" till the end. Japan is a great example, very old society with no immigration and they now struggle to fill in positions, their future on economic growth and healthcare and ability to pay pensions is as uncertain as ever. They will have to either bear more children, which you can't force a population to do especially since the more educated/wealthy a population is the less children they have or they will have to start accepting immigrants.

4698,"By not showing solidarity, I obviously meant the immigration quota and relocation schemes that were the point here. The reason for that is we just don't agree that this is the path to fixing anything. It's just trying to push part of the problem to other countries.

Firstly, Belgium has pursued its own immigration policy and the result is, to put it mildly, very unattractive. The immigrants have largely been taken from only a narrow part of less developed world with different religion and culture, there's no balance geographically, nor by socio-economic classes e.g. it's all mostly low-educated workers (granted, it's more difficult to attract educated talents and well-off people, but importing a new underclass should still be avoided).

This makes one reason for Eastern EU members to not even consider any proposal that would give even the slightest power to Brussels to control migration flows in the union. Simply put, when it comes to immigration policy, many Western European countries are seen as total failure already whose example should not be copied. Brussels would likely do the same mistakes again.

Secondly, migration flows are such a delicate topic, especially in Baltics which suffered massive colonization in USSR, that this just isn't something to even debate. Migration is and will remain under member states' control only. Which means any kind of obligatory migration quotas, no matter how small or for what reasons, should be out of the picture.

Now what concerns voluntary quotas, it's already a bit different subject. Baltics have, so far, participated in that, but results have been pretty disappointing. More than half of the migrants have escaped to Germany or so. In Estonia, two have been convicted for violent acts. Nevertheless, I think Estonia should participate to an extent, considering our nation sent tens of thousands of refugees during WWII.

V4 has several populist governments that have rejected even voluntary quotas. While that's not the most productive step, it's also not as dramatic as many like to pretend. Most of the migrants leave to Germany anyway, and there are legitimate reasons to be scared of terrorists among the refugees. However, so-called populist acts by Hungary (fence) or Italy (shut down NGO human traffickers) have done wonders to decrease migration flows, while they have been screamed at for being 'populist', 'racist' and what not, while claiming there's no other way than to accept all migrants. The latter has been proved to be complete bullshit.

Adding to all that, it's Western European countries that have the pull factor for migrants. Your social benefits are way too generous for migrants and there was a chancellor who literally invited migrants to her country. This is again, seen as a problem alien to us, or at least something that can be fixed by Western Europe, not us.

&amp;#x200B;

So the conclusive point is not that we are not showing solidarity because we are scumbags, it's because we see the main reason of the problem being stupid decisions by Western European politicians. It's clear today that the 'bring them all in' policy has been a total disaster, it's clear that supporting NGO ships on the Mediterranean had caused more deaths than banning them etc. It's clear that removing pull factors (like decreasing benefits for migrants, openly saying that don't come here etc) decrease illegal crossings. But all that was only done when faced by 'populists' and what not. We live in an era where political correctness in Western Europe is so bad that even controlling the continent's borders are seen as racist (granted, not anymore though).",Eesti,/r/europe/comments/a6fa4y/belgian_pm_suggests_visegrad_countries_should_be/ebwfplf/,toreon,1544950847

The first New Year's Eve party that I remember - I must have been about six years old - all of us kids were plonked in front of the TV when ""Dinner For One"" came on, and of course we almost pissed ourselves laughing.

Now that my friends have kids, I'm kinda looking forward to seeing them watch ""Dinner For One"" and almost pissing themselves laughing. And so the tradition continues.

Edit: About the catchphrase and how famous it is in Germany: my dad and a colleague had the same birthday. So every year, they'd stand at opposite corners of the office and one of them would quote, in English: ""Same procedure as last year?"" and the other one would respond: ""Same procedure as every year!"" before they approached each other and shook hands.

4906,"""The current deal includes more negotiations which will result in Brexit. This is because UK is very hard to negotiate with and the current negotiations are running out of time""

Nonsense, May just went to the EU and they point blank refused to negotiate and there is a clause that the UK can not leave unless the EU agrees.  That is permanent until it changes and that is not Brexit.  IF the Eu wants a plan they have until Mar 31 to get the UK parliment to agree to it and they are refusing to negotiate.

""Current deal makes it possible to continue negotiations without hard exit""
Again, the current deal does not involve the UK separating from the EU and the EU not the UK is refusing to negotiate which is a growing trend.  Look at the PA and IA.  Trump repeatedly offered to negotiate deals that were not approved the the EU flat out refused to negotiate so Trump just walked.  The Eu is not a sovereign entity.  If it makes itself hard to deal with then nations will not deal with it.

""What are the aspects EU should cooperate with? What negotiation points the UK wants but the EU has rejected out of spite? Can you single out any real examples?""

Literally, 100% of the deal is the part that the EU is refusing to negotiate.    As for what the UK wants, that is very very simple.  It wants to leave the EU and control its own borders and who does and does not enter and they want to trade with whomever they choose.  Just like they did before they entered the EU.

1.	Barnevernet are not allowed to comment, hence desperate and often insane parents fight it one sided in the media.
2.	Eastern European parents are conditioned to be afraid of state systems + language barriers lead to situations escalating. (Child protection services use a variety of tools including monetary support, psychological support, child care help etc, BEFORE they go to the drastic step of taking away the child.)
3.	it sells. The idea of a flaw in the ‚ÄúPerfect paradise‚Äù goes right home in Eastern European minds. Thinking they are at least better in _something_. It‚Äôs probably false however.

4944,"&gt;The budget needs slimming down at the very least.   

......... What...?   

The EU's budget was 137 billion in 2017 which represents 2% of EU nations' budget and of which a majority is reinvested into infrastructure projects and subsidies for struggling sectors. Only 6% of the EU's annual budget goes to salaries, pensions, buildings, ... It employs 70.000 people. The city of Vienna alone employs 65.000 people.    

So when you say the budget needs slimming down, I'm really not sure what you're talking about. Unless we want to defund the EU so much that it becomes effectively irrelevant.    

&gt;Obviously you want a bigger and bigger EU because you're the capital.   

I don't work for the EU and considering my job is completely irrelevant in any way to servicing the people that come here for the EU, I really have no stake in having the EU capital in Brussels. For all I care they put it in Antarctica, maybe that way some real estate space in Brussels opens up.

For example Wales‚Äô biggest parties are the same as working class England‚Äôs. It‚Äôs not even close.  It‚Äôs not like Scotland or Northern Ireland where there‚Äôs unique parties that are wildly popular.

We thought so too - but this is not how it turned out. Instead we have criminal gangs, manyfold increase in violent and gun crime. The people who came here are not learning the language, but instead forming parallel societies (ghettos). 

The immigrant areas remind me of the places I visit in Cairo and neighbouring countries. I don't know if you've travelled there, but it's not quaint. The current demographic trend would mean that in a couple of generations, the natives are minority, and that would turn the country into just that.

Noi siamo rimasti gli unici a combaterli anche dopo essere traditi si dal Veneto si dai serbi, che erano tutti e due christiani. La converzione albanese e cominciata nell secolo 18-to. La ragione e che l'Impero alzo le tasse per i non musulmani e introdu nuove leggi x i christiani. Anche dopo eser diventati musulmani i albanesi sono rimasti   contro i Ottomani e hanno lavorato con il Vaticano ed altri paesi europei per batterli. E ogni singola volta ci hanno tradito. Non ti dico questo per compassione o per aparire come vittime ma per spiegarti che la religione non significa niente per noi. Siamo diventati musulmani per sopravivere doppo essere fottuti da tutti i nostri alleati, chiamarci traditori per questo e un grande insulto sull sacrifico che i nostri antenati hanno fatto. Se vuoi sapere piu della vera situazione nel balkano oggi  puoi chiederchi.

 Ti posso anche parlare del' bell tratamento che i serbi avevano riservato per noi albanesi christiani, dopo che abbiamo battuto i Ottomani ed annunciato l'indipendenca. (questo lo dicodico xche credi che se non sarebemo diventati musulmani tutto sarebe GUCCI tra noi e loro)

Alla fine puoi pensare come vuoi e hai il dirotto di piacere ed oddiare cosa tu vuoi. Io non ti posso imponere niente, se ti piace la serbia e i serbi e non ti piaciamo noi il tuo business e di nessun altro. Ma non fare il cane d'attaco facendo propaganda/insultandoci solo xche siamo Albanesi.

5101,"&gt;  Racism is bigotry + power

No, it isn't. Racism is:

&gt; *Prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.* Source: [The Oxford Dictionary](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/racism). 

So:

5105,"&gt; Several EU politicians and EU members have hinted at or outright said that they won't let them back in.

The UK can, as per the EU's legal decision (which I am not convinced is a great idea in terms of precedent down the line, but whatever) unilaterally cancel A50 during this period.  So it's not a question of them being permitted back in, technically.  My argument was that this should be irrelevant, because it would be highly beneficial to the EU to have a Brcancel, so the EU would accept a cancellation anyway.  Various people (Juncker, for one, as I recall) have made statements along those lines.

The UK *may* want an A50 extension to hold a referendum, in practice, and that could be blocked by the EU.  But if she *had* to, I suppose that she could hold it in less time, cut into campaign time.  Lord knows that the last two years have been one giant Brexit conversation.

Also, as I said again ‚Äî it makes no sense for the EU to block a cancellation, and blocking a referendum that has the potential to offer cancellation would be crazy.

The only case where I could see that making sense is if the UK, absent referendum, would take the May deal and the referendum would be expected to cause no-deal to win, which would be disadvantageous to the EU.  Not permitting an extension for that would make sense from the EU's position.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/a6i6ns/how_could_a_second_brexit_referendum_happen/ebvc81i/,vokegaf,1544912354

5162,"&gt; Your argument is based on fear and by that standard we shouldn't do a lot of things or be afraid that a meteorite can wipe out half or all of us or yellowstone could errupt and we might stop bothering.

We have no control over either. We do have control over our choice of power plant. It's not because I may get lung cancer without doing anything special, that I should start smoking.

&gt;More than that though, it's denying reality. It is a fact are that the world wouldn't look as it does (good and bad) if nuclear power wouldn't be harnessed. 

That's if you make major assumptions about what the alternatives would be. OPEC would still try to leverage its kartel position, and at that point renewables would be the only option for energy independence.

&gt;If you live in Europe you're surrounded by nuclear power plants and nothing major has happened.

If we take that argument seriously we don't need to do anything about climate change either.

&gt; We're scared to create a place that might pose a problem in the future.

You try to frame it as fear, but it's simply unethical to shove off the risks on other people while pocketing the benefit ourselves.

&gt; I think it's hard to take care of that, but not impossible.

I think we shouldn't pretend to guarantee that we can safekeep something for a period longer than most states exist - hell, longer than most *languages* exist.

&gt;There are serious risk management and control assessments and procedures, audits, planning and conception and QA of materials and components used to do what humanity can really shine at.

I'm pretty sure everyone involved is doing their best. I'm also sure that that best is very good. I'm even more sure that by definition we can't reduce the risk to zero unless the future is deterministic and we can check it.

&gt; Solve engineering problems and come up with great solutions. 

Well, let's focus those efforts on renewables then. There are many more angles to work on there, so there also are many more possible findings.

&gt;It is the cleanest reliable form of energy generation satisfying the energy needs our population has. 

Nuclear energy has a very peculiar risk profile, significantly different from all alternatives, that makes such comparisons specious.

&gt;If anything, governments should be even harder on enforcing.

Nuclear waste requires aftercare for a longer period than most states exist.

&gt;There's no real alternative available (I'm sure someone has great ideas that weren't considered commercially viable, which is a different and unfortunate problem). 

That applies to all hypothetical nuclear solutions to the limitations of nuclear energy though (breeders, thorium, fusion).

And those problems are long-standing. At least for renewables the full force of the market can be leveraged, and innovation has a much shorter implementation cycle. If we order a nuclear plant now, it will take at least a decade before it works, and then it will remain at the same technology level until it is decommissioned - for the better part of a century, so it will be antique. It's as if we still ran steam engines in 1970.

&gt;I'm sure that there still will be fission plants for special purposes.

Likewise take another look at the text you are quoting. Nothing there says the people of the UK have to decide in a Ref. Or even that the Commons have to vote. Or that MPs from Scotland, Wales, or NI in their regional parliaments have to agree. It just says that the decision has to be valid with regard to the UK's law. That is not an issue that anyone disagrees with.

By the way, IIRC, the UK SC already ruled that the devolved parliaments, specifically Scotland, do not have to ratify the decision and can't stop it. I'm not even sure technically the UK HoC have to formally approve. From what I remember UK govt is providing for a 'meaningful' vote because they wish to have support of MPs, not because they need it.

The late 80s reforms weren't minor at all. The economic transformation stared in late 1988, and ended in 1992. As with all economic overturns, the GDP was dropping *during it*, but it resulted in good economic growth later on from 1993 onward. So if you want to compare growth rates, 1993-2004 and 2004-2015 would be a much more honest comparison.

You are. Brexiters are not rioters. If they were then they have had years of decisions going against the general public opinion on the EU to riot and they haven't. The idea that people would be dying in the streets is simply fantasy.

The worst that would happen is UKIP coming back to life or Farage starting a new party.

&gt;I think the only solution in my poor opinion, is for UK to leave for a no deal, suffer a little bit, come to their senses and then rejoin EU. It's like letting someone who insists he can survive alone, sleep outside in the forest in the cold winter night, they will return first thing in the morning, In UK's case, several years.

I voted Remain and would be happy if we somehow end up staying but the UK is not some small country that is going to fall apart outside of the EU. We will take a hit but we've been there before many times through many recessions, high unemployment and bad times yet we got through them.

So the problem is that the EU should have bended backwards more? Lets not pretend the exceptions are only those kinds. Not being part of Schengen and the Euro are pretty big exceptions that make the cohesion much harder but go right in the direction of solving the main issues people supposedly have that lead to Brexit. Note that I'm perfectly ok with the exceptions that exist right now, but lets not pretend the UK doesn't have a great deal with the EU. The things that Brexit is supposedly about, if anyone really knows what they are, are all already possible (borders, economic independence, etc).

&gt;The reason everyone agreed to the rebate when the UK joined, despite the EU having so much more bargaining power, is that the existing system would have been ridiculously unfair without it.

The reason everyone was willing to accommodate the UK is that everyone really wanted this to work. Now we're getting into a much more cynical view of the EU everywhere, for this and other reasons.

When European countries conquered colonies because of their advanced technology and overwhelming force, did they invest and build those countries and make sure they had a free democracy so that they were in control of their own destiny? No, you exploited them and stripped them of their resources. When Germany lost WW1 did France or Britain let Germany have a do-over or did they force the treaty of Versailles on you? We treated Germany with mercy which is way more than they deserved.

Completely subsidizing their national defense and protecting them from complete Soviet invasion. For always fighting for their national interest and propping them up on the world stage. For creating a fair global system in which Germany could export its goods and grow its economy. For being the deciding factor in its reunification and existence as we know it.

Poland is our ally. They realize that they need us much more than we need them so they try to help us out when they can. I know a lot of people in the military and they would much rather be stationed in Poland where the locals treat them well than Germany.

The US enters these alliances because it makes us stronger when we are allied in a large defensive bloc. Our politician's jobs are to do what's best for us but they always have choices as to whether or not they help other people in the process, even when it's not directly advantageous to do so. Why do you think the US supported Montenegro's ascension into NATO? They have nothing to offer us but we still agreed to protect them. For every Dick Cheney out there there's a George H.W.

5795,"&gt;And that's not all. Britain used this flow of tribute from India to finance the expansion of capitalism in Europe and regions of European settlement, like Canada and Australia. So not only the industrialisation of Britain but also the industrialisation of much of the Western world was facilitated by extraction from the colonies.

Has the author actually verified that, for example, Canada was a net beneficiary?  She was a set of colonies too.

I mean, we revolted and split off the British Empire long before the Raj existed, so we're a bit of a control.  If funds from India were what industrialized Canada, you'd kind of expect an underdeveloped US and an industrialized Canada.

I mean, I get complaining about System X way back when, but I think that he's kinda jumping from there to pretty broad claims about the way the world is without a lot of support.

5801,"In the US, he probably wouldn't have [standing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_\(law\)), and the court would throw the case out.

&gt;In law, standing or *locus standi* is the term for the ability of a party to demonstrate to the court sufficient connection to and harm from the law or action challenged to support that party's participation in the case. Standing exists from one of three causes:
&gt;
&gt;* The party is directly subject to an adverse effect by the statute or action in question, and the harm suffered will continue unless the court grants relief in the form of damages or a finding that the law either does not apply to the party or that the law is void or can be nullified. This is called the ""something to lose"" doctrine, in which the party has standing because they will be directly harmed by the conditions for which they are asking the court for relief.
&gt;* The party is not directly harmed by the conditions by which they are petitioning the court for relief but asks for it because the harm involved has some reasonable relation to their situation, and the continued existence of the harm may affect others who might not be able to ask a court for relief. In the United States, this is the grounds for asking for a law to be struck down as violating the First Amendment, because while the plaintiff might not be directly affected, the law might so adversely affect others that one might never know what was not done or created by those who fear they would become subject to the law ‚Äì the so-called ""chilling effects"" doctrine.
&gt;* The party is granted automatic standing by act of law.[1] Under some environmental laws in the United States, a party may sue someone causing pollution to certain waterways without a federal permit, even if the party suing is not harmed by the pollution being generated. The law allows them to receive attorney's fees if they substantially prevail in the action. In some U.S. states, a person who believes a book, film or other work of art is obscene may sue in their own name to have the work banned directly without having to ask a District Attorney to do so.
&gt;
&gt;In the United States, the current doctrine is that a person cannot bring a suit challenging the constitutionality of a law unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that he/it is or will ""imminently"" be harmed by the law. Otherwise, the court will rule that the plaintiff ""lacks standing"" to bring the suit, and will dismiss the case without considering the merits of the claim of unconstitutionality. To have a court declare a law unconstitutional, there must be a valid reason for the lawsuit. The party suing must have something to lose in order to sue unless it has automatic standing by action of law.

Do you think its because the US government just loves to do expensive stuff for other nations because the US government is headed by the best and brightest and most altrusitic people? Or maybe its out of self interest? Nah probably because people like Dick Cheney and Bolton and Bush and Kissinger and Brzezinski etc are such saints who just love foreingers so much they want to spend a lot of money to help them. Out of the kindness in their hearts.

5871,"''it was a natural and useful ‚Äúcheck and balance‚Äù against blind progress.'' 
That is the way the British want to perceive their stance yet what is blind and what is useful is not a prerogative of the British to decide, rather it's a covering term for trying to steer the project into an intergovernmental cadre, a cadre that they had professed ever since 1945 but that had failed to take hold in the post-war years. 

''We‚Äôve had millennia of war - assuming that it can all be brushed aside and forgotten in a few short decades is wishful thinking.''
A fallacy based on a wrong view of history. The probability of the upcoming event is not based on for how long it has been going on before that. We've had millennia of early infant mortality, that doesn't mean that because of that we need to have it for a lot longer afterwards. That is determinism. In fact, there has not been a tension of war between any member states since the Schuman Plan and the biggest antagonism that it was meant to pacify (between germany and france) has become one of the most productive partnerships of the last decades. 

''I know this is not the case - or at least I hope it isn‚Äôt - ''
So to part of you it makes sense that it might just be. The siege mentality of Britain in which the other side of the channel is a place of war is a world war II founded concept that has made a large imprint on the British psyche and is a large factor for their euro-skepticism. 

''The UK‚Äôs initial attitude was ‚Äúless haste, more speed‚Äù, which wasn‚Äôt wrong, it was just unpopular. But by trying to forge ahead regardless, Europe has helped galvanise the British into a more reactionary stance. Europe isn‚Äôt entirely blameless in Brexit.'' 
Britain signed off on all of this, again the myth of a more level headed Britain has no bearing on reality. Either way, Britain was there at the negotiations, they signed off on it and got major concessions on the points where it disagreed. The UK is leaving the UK at a time where her terms have never been more favourable and that is not up to the EU, it is up to Britain. 

''Now that the UK is leaving, the continent wants to unify the military.''
This idea has been circulating for decades now and it was always out of the question to force the entire EU into it. The basis of the European army is always a ''coalition of the willing''. 

''I just hope that the Irish government values our neutrality enough'' 
Your neutrality towards what? Ireland, through being linked in the market, shares in the EU in a lot of foreign policy objectives, not the least of which are the sanctions against Russia. 

''it should use our veto to steer this ever tighter union onto a course that‚Äôs in line with ALL of our values.''
what values are you missing out on specifically.

5890,"&gt; Fundamentally the UK is politically at odds with the rest of Europe. 

As it has always been, hence the dozens of opt-outs and exceptions it gained over the decades.

&gt; Which makes the UK politicians feel hamstrung by leftist in Brussels. 

Quite the opposite, the UK has been preventing further integration in some policies (especially economic ones) for quite a while, while it strongly supported the EU expansion to the east - something at odds with its desire to end free movement of people.

&gt; Plus the EU is quite a hypocritical organisation that the UK has had trouble with for a while. 

Brexit and the entire UK government has been considerably more hypocritical than anything the EU could come up with. TBH the EU has always opted for negotiating in favourable terms to the UK before this shitshow. 
People seem to forget that the EU offered mechanisms for the UK to restrict the freedom of movement in exchange of not moving forward with the referendum, in clear contraction of the 4 pillars, and I'm sure the UK could've gotten even more if it wasn't being led by a bunch of hypocritical politicians.

&gt; We the people don't benefit from a United states of Europe. Unless someone can show how everyone benefits from a European superstate I will be against it.

5935,"Moore's law technically refers to increase of transistor density, saying that it grew exponentially.

The reason it was so important, though, was because that density produced as a side effect exponential *serial* computation speed (do A, then do B that depends on it). Serial computation speed, which had previously exhibited exponential growth (doubling about every 1.5 years), stopped doing so in the early 2000s.  When that growth had been happening, it just made everything faster, no effort from programmers.  That's the best kind of speedup.

Today, processors are still seeing improvements in parallel processing power (do A and do B that does not depend on A and tell me when both are done), but while all tasks can be done in serial, not all can be done in parallel.  Also, a lot of conventions and tools and ways of thinking are oriented towards serial computation, so it's generally somewhat harder/slower for a programmer to produce software in parallel form than serial.

That rapid increase kept letting computers do more and more for half-a-century at an unheard-of-pace, and the improvements spilled over into all industries.
