3,"Mo is getting absolutely crucified in the media.

I'm a lorry driver for those who don't know and Mo is known by quite a few as he attends lots of truck shows and exhibits his lorry in them.

It is commonplace for a trailer to come into the UK without a lorry on the front of it, it is known as ""Unaccompanied Freight"" and I'm sure all of those who have ever used a ferry have seen the signs for the trailer parks on the docks as they've travelled through them. Trailer is dropped off at docks in EU, a tug loads it onto the ferry on the EU side, it sails over to the UK, a tug pulls it off the ferry and drops it in the unaccompanied freight trailer park. UK haulier picks up the trailer from the docks and takes it to its delivery.

When you pick up a trailer from the unaccompanied trailer park it is sealed and secured. You can't break the seal and open the trailer to inspect it because then if there's any shortages you're accused of stealing and pretty much every delivery location will automatically refuse a delivery if the seal is broken or the number on the seal does not match the paperwork. You therefore have no idea of what is on the back nor have the chance to inspect it but even though the authorities all know this they'll pin the blame on you for anything found as if you'd put the stuff there yourself.",England,/r/europe/comments/dme794/39_found_dead_in_lorry_were_chinese_nationals/f503ngh/,MinuteNoodles,1571921297

18th century PLC had all of these problems. There is more: some of magnates were billionares by today standards: had their own private armies, and income bigger than the crown. That's not all - they tried (and suceeded) to elect their own kings. They forced lack of reforms on the Commonwealth. They were allying themselves with foreign powers for own gain.

In the same way, if we recognise that these things that constitute ""white privilege"" were done by particular empires and countries of the 16th-20th centuries, and we don't want to do that any more, then we can work to dissolve the assumptions on which these are based.

Even to the point  of people recruiting to take part. Turkish nation is militaristic and patriotic by nature and the PKK is seen as the greatest extential threat to the country's integrity. People also tend to forget that not every Kurd is a PKK sympathizer, PKK has committed plenty of massacres in Kurdish villages they seemed as ""traitors"" so a good portion of the Kurdish population in Turkey hates them.

&gt;IHS Markit’s Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 50.2 in &gt;October, missing economist estimates of 50.3.

&gt;Euro-area economy struggles to gather pace at start of fourth &gt;quarter
&gt;The outlook is gloomy, with future expectations sinking to its worst &gt;since 2013, according to Markit. A rebound in French services &gt;provided a boost while the pace of German decline slowed, while &gt;the rest of the region showed weakness.

&gt;A key divergence between France and Germany remained trade, &gt;with the former seeing modest growth in new business from &gt;abroad, while Germany’s exports remained in steep decline.

Till this day Kurds resist and the PKK forces are Kurds who rise up against Turkish oppression.

This is huge bs. PKK came to exist as a Soviet project. They have committed countless terror attacks against civilians, cops, teachers and soldiers. They are not a legitimate militia but a terrorist organisation.

435,"Ohh, Berlin. What is Berlin? Berlin, as a city, brings nothing but shame to Germany on the international stage. When comparing Berlin with other European capitals such as London, Paris, Madrid and Amsterdam, any decent human’s face must blush in humiliation. Even small countries like Austria, Belgium or Switzerland have Vienna, Brussels and Zurich: presentable cities, complete with high standards of living. Germany gets punished with Berlin, capital of losers. In all the republic, Berlin is home to the largest number of arseholes by far. Deutsche Bahn, Bundestag, Air Berlin and Axel Springer are but a few examples of all the incompetent scum being kept here. Glorious times have long since passed, the city is face down in the dirt. Berliners are lazy sods to their very core. Traits that would, in any civilised culture, pass for nothing but laziness, rudeness, incompetence, dissocial personality disorder or idiocy, are taken by the Berliner and declared a way of life. That is why the Berliner harbours intense feelings of hatred for anyone who’s better than him in any way. Especially the all-around superior Southern Germany are a thorn in his side. He envies their success, and Munich makes the top on his list of hatred. That city is – and has! – everything that Berlin wants to be and have. Berliners take no interest in the fact that it is Munich that finances their dissolute lifestyle, in fact, they secretly believe that they have earned it. So instead of freeing themselves from their envious and resentful lethargy, instead of rolling up their sleeves and improve their city, they revel in their antisocial freeloading and praise their so-called global city. Culturally, Berliners are set up rather weakly, great works lie far back in history. Moreover, mispronouncing “g” as “j” is considered a great cultural feat. Advanced students have mastered ending each and every sentence with a “wa?”. The city’s culinary performance is second-rate. Here, a sausage made from glued-together, meaty odds and ends adorned with ketchup and curry powder is sold as a culinary masterpiece. Hardly any reasonable person would consider a bratwurst with ketchup a recipe, let alone the holy grail of culinary arts. Yet, in their magnanimity, the rest of the republic lets the Berliner keep his delusion, not wanting to amplify his inferiority complex. Economically, Berlin is an utter disaster, even the late GDR stood on more solid ground. The local economy is based around alternative blogs, something-something-media and, if universities are to be believed, gender studies. Disregarding his own bankruptcy, the Berliner treats himself to prestigious projects like the city palace and the airport – which, considering its inoperative nature, is likely an art installation. Moreover, the city houses all popular parties’ headquarters, who refrain from using “traitors” in their official names (Probably for marketing reasons). For the longest time, this “town’s” “mayor”, the jolly Wowibear, butchered anything he found left in a presentable state. Long story short: Berlin is Germany’s tiled coffee table. It is to Germany what Greece is to the European Union, and if it had open sewerage, it would be Germanys Romania. Berlin is a blemish, the abscess on the arse of the nation. Berlin is the uninvited party guest, who didn’t even bring any booze and wouldn’t even understand he’s not welcome if he had is teeth beaten out and got thrown down the stairs. Berlin is the Detroit of Germany and should be sold to Poland for 200 Złoty.",,/r/europe/comments/dm6ms1/berlin/f4z45yq/,watershed2018,1571894126

514,"I decided to look it up. The lowest ever recorded temperature in Toronto was -33 °C on January 10 1859. In the past 50 years my city has gone under that in 23 different years. Our lowest ever temperature was -41 °C in the late nineties. Two years ago we touched -40 °C once again. Remember when I said that Toronto had a 44% chance of a white Christmas? Well my city has only had one since 1900. Combine that with close to no sunshine in the winter (it's one hour south of the arctic circle by car) and I seriously doubt that your climate is so bad that I can't even relate to it. As I said, there were a couple of months a year when I didn't bike either, but for the majority of the year it's still okay. There are definitely warmer places than Toronto were people are biking. You're average high in July is 26.6 °C, which is close to perfect biking weather. Even if there are a couple of days where the weather is too hot, there are still plenty of days where the temperature isn't an issue. Anything between -10 and 30 °C is perfectly fine.

You can always look at other cities around the world and see the success they've had. It's hard to imagine if you go there now, but Amsterdam used to be full of cars up until the 1970's. My suggestion is to start with some roads and see how it works out. History shows that if you build paths, bikers will emerge. Saying ""no-one bikes today"" is a bad argument in my opinion, since what options do people really have? Get out on the freeway with the 18 wheelers?

A reminder that original comment that started this discussion was this:

Implying that ""current criminals"" are not being punished, along the same lines of other commenters who keep proclaiming how supposedly ""nobody is ever getting deported!"" and ""they never face any consequences!"". 

Which is something I vehemently disagree with because laws are actually applied: People suspected of breaking it will be investigated, maybe even arrested, a court will hear the case and based on the evidence make a judgment. Just like it's supposed to be in any nation of law.

942,"&gt; A mother who uses a cannabis-based drug to treat her seven year old son’s epilepsy has announced she will go on hunger strike to pressure the government into funding the treatment.

&gt; Karen Gray, 44, from Edinburgh, uses oil from the whole cannabis plant, illegal in the UK without a license, to treat her son Murray’s rare form of epilepsy.

&gt; But the treatment of Bedrolite and Bedrocan costs £1,200 a month, which Ms Gray has been sourcing via donations since Murray was given the prescription by a Dutch doctor in March.

&gt; Ms Gray has lobbied the government for an NHS prescription to fund the drug along with other mothers in the same situation as part of the campaign group End Our Pain.

&gt; Twenty families wrote to the Prime Minister in September to demand NHS prescriptions and government funding to cover the costs in the meantime, but received no response.

&gt; Now Ms Gray and at least 17 other mothers plan to go on hunger strike from November 1 outside Downing Street to put pressure on the government.

&gt; “We’re at a desperate situation, we’ve absolutely had enough. We feel like we’ve got no option and we have to do something drastic,” Ms Gray said.

&gt; “The government needs to step in and provide funding until the prescriptions are sorted out,” she said.

&gt; Ms Gray would like the same provision granted to her son as to Alfie Dingley, who was granted an exception by the Home Office in 2018 to give NHS funding for the whole plant cannabis oil he takes.

&gt; British law was changed last year to allow prescription of medical cannabis, but only containing cannabidiol (CBD), not tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the active ingredient in whole plant cannabis oil.

&gt; The British Paediatric Neurology Association says that THC may negatively affect brain development, structure and mental health.

&gt; Murray received his first course of Epidiolex, a legal drug containing CBD, in August 2018. It appeared to work, but the positive effects subsided after three months and Murray was admitted to hospital in January unable to “eat, talk or walk.”

&gt; Gray said she thought her son “was going to die”, until a Dutch doctor prescribed a drug containing THC. Murray began treatment on Bedrolite in March, and Bedrocan in May.

&gt; Now Murray is a ‘changed wee boy’, at school full-time and taking part in normal play and other activities despite his Doose syndrome.

&gt; Ms Gray currently has just enough funds to pay for Murray’s treatment until the end of the year.

&gt; She recently took part in a sponsored walk across the Forth Road Bridge, and will attend a fundraising Race Night in November.

&gt; “It’s difficult, I don’t like asking people for money but I’ve got no choice,” she said.

957,"There's no 100% guarantee but the likelihood of parliament returning another hung parliament is incredibly low. Our electoral system is literally designed to give the least unpopular party a majority to aid stability. (you can form a large majority on 30% of the vote; if you get 30% in half the seats and the opposition get 25-29%). All current polling points towards a large Conservative victory at the next election, although the campaign could change this (if they do something insane like propose repossessing their voters houses to fund their care bills again, which I doubt they will). If the Conservatives somehow managed to fuck up the election process the likelihood is enough of the independents who've been formed in the current parliament (independents notoriously struggled to get elected - 1 was elected in 2017 - there's now 35 sitting in parliament (kicked or resigned from their parties). Those independents being replaced should likely lead to enough members for bigger parties for a coalition of some sort emerge rather than a confidence and supply arrangement like the one with the DUP in the unlikely event that happens.

**The Spanish government retires its cartoon video on the sentence of 1-O because ""it would hurt sensitivities""**

*The networks explode against the images that represent the independentistas leaders like thieves*

[Link to the video]

The Spanish government has withdrawn the cartoon video about the 1-O ruling, published by Global Spain on Twitter, because ""it would hurt sensitivities"". Foreign Ministry admits ""the mistake"" and says they did not intend to ""hurt anyone"" by disseminating this content to social networks. The video broadcasted in English argued that the independence leaders were condemned by the Supreme Court because of ""acting outside the law"" and not ""because of their ideas"" and characterized Oriol Junqueras as a delinquent dressed in a striped pajamas and a mask.

""We did not intend to injure anyone, not even those who describe us as a fascist state exercising their right to freedom of expression,"" they say from the Spanish government. In fact, the head of the communication from Spain Global has made a tweet in which he assumes ""the error"":

After Global Spain published the video, the controversy broke out in the networks, which were filled with criticism of the images represented by the jailed independentist leaders and in exile with cartoons of characters like thieves, accompanied by the message : ""The defendants have not been tried by their ideas, but because of acting out of legality.""

971,"&gt;More generally, however, and particularly for people elsewhere in Europe looking at this, it is worth bearing in mind that even the vast majority of UK Remainers would be seen as Eurosceptic elsewhere on the continent.  They generally don't favour ever closer union, an eu army, tax harmonisation, or UK entry in Schengen or the Euro.  It seems very unlikely to me that, even if this referendum result is thwarted, that the UK will comfortably sit in the EU for very much longer.

This point really doesn't get made often enough tbh. I honestly think there is some sort of strange gulf of information about the EU between the UK and the rest of Europe. It was just sort of this thing that we're attached to but nobody knows what it is or where its headed.

In fact, more research on FGM might be useful for you since most cut women (as questioned in West and East Africa) vehemently defend the practice and consider themselves cleaner and as having healthy sex lives. 

There’s a lot of hysteria and bad faith in Western anti FGM campaigns that leads them to be dismissed as colonial attempts at culture change. You see this in britain especially where adult consenting women to Type IV procedures for religious reasons and/or from migration background are considered “harmed” and “abused” but a white woman with a labial piercing (technically also type IV) is exercising bodily autonomy.

&gt; We need to become stricter and reduce incentives.

Ah, the good ol' ""They *all* just come for free stuff"" narrative. It's not like that's been peddled for [decades before](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostock-Lichtenhagen_riots) against people you now consider our ""union partners"". 

&gt; We need to control our borders we need to install a system to hold and deport illegals

Once again implying that such systems don't exist and the EU has some kind of ""[open border](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/eu-border-wall-berlin-migration-human-rights-immigration-borders-a8624706.html)"". 

&gt; we need to cooperate

That I can agree with, and if that would have actually happened then Germany wouldn't have been stuck with so many. Instead the ""cooperation"" consisted of EU countries passing the problem on to each other, with some flat out refusing any cooperation.

That's where you should direct your rage for lack of cooperation, not on the imaginary problem of the EU supposedly not having secured borders and supposedly nobody getting arrested and deported.

1097,"Nope. You are completely full of lies and distortion yourself. Nice projection there.

&gt;The Syrian Kurds of the PYD actually acted against female genital mutilation, forced marriages and gave women equal treatment.

Bull.shit. Kurdish treatment of women has always been horrid. Also FGM is something you assume everyone else agrees. Except a few crazies, no faction in Middle east has supported FGM.

Also PYD and PKK have committed several atrocities in Iraq, and in Syria. They likewise killed and displaced other ethnic groups to create their ethnostate, which you Westerners are drooling to see happen.

It. Will. Not. Not because Kurds don't deserve a homeland, mind you. Just so you don't get your wish (out of spite).

&gt;Your remark about Kurdish treatment of women is sadly enough true for too many Turkish and Iraqi Kurds, but with you painting the whole ethnic group of Kurds as treating their women worse than Arabs makes you a racist.

You use the word ""racist"" like you what it means. Nice job taking a page out of Trotsky and Lenin.

&gt;As for claiming that the Kurds have more Armenian blood on their hands, that only proves how much you deny your own country's past and how much you still seem to be living in that past.

&gt;It also confirms your hatred for Kurds, despite all of the Turkish nationalist claims that they have equal rights and are treated just the same as every other Turkish citizen.

But if it houses PKK which then passes over to Turkey to cause terrorism, we will give it the Hulagu treatment. And be thankful! Erdoğan easily bends over before USA threats of corruption and account persecution of his wealth.

If it was Bülent Ecevit, Iraq and Syria would be annexed now. That old CHAD man shut down Incirlik when USA got uppity! 

Pray to your white redneck midwest corn-fed image of Jesus that you will always manage to support a dog like Erdoğan who SEEMS to oppose you, but secretly does your bidding just enough to look cool to gullible Turkish yokels.

Rescue\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rescue_of_the_Bulgarian_Jews&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3)\]

Some who had previously supported deportation of Bulgarian Jews recanted and refused to co-operate when their imminent death became clear.

Bulgarian politicians, including [Dimitar Peshev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimitar_Peshev), were originally in favour of anti-Jewish legislation and only opposed requests for deportations of Bulgarian Jews\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\]. The Bulgarian government gave no protection at all to Jews living in [Macedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_(region)) and [Thrace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrace). [Alexander Belev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Belev), who was responsible for the [Jewish problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_problem) in this region at the time, met little resistance when he sent Jews from there to the [Treblinka extermination camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treblinka_extermination_camp). Belev's actions were never scrutinised or morally questioned until he turned to Bulgarian Jewry when he could not meet the 20,000-person quota without including them. Moreover, [Tsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bulgarian_monarchs) [Boris III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_III_of_Bulgaria) neither acted to help Bulgarian Jews, nor showed any empathy for them\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\].

There was an intense national outcry. Protests were held throughout the country, with both ordinary citizens and religious leaders, including bishop Kiril of [Plovdiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plovdiv),[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue_of_the_Bulgarian_Jews#cite_note-9) threatening to block the path of [Holocaust trains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_trains) by lying on the railroad tracks.

Under immense pressure, Boris III was dissuaded from continuing the deportations and instead assigned Jews to forced labour groups throughout the country, telling [Adolf Eichmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Eichmann) and [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler) that Bulgaria needed them for railroad construction and other industrial work.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue_of_the_Bulgarian_Jews#cite_note-10)",BAlgaria,/r/europe/comments/dhvxxk/bulgaria_v_england_euro_2020_qualifier/f4vgh3s/,Mladenetsa,1571842094

In *Mediterranean Fascism 1919–1945*, the Inspector-General of Public Security in Milan, G. Gasti, is cited as saying ""[...] he always wanted to give the appearance of still being a socialist, and he fooled himself into thinking that this was the case.""


Mussolini was expelled from the Italian Socialist Party (over his support of war). He dropped support for class conflict (thats the socialism part) and went for class collaboration united by a nationalist cause (thats fascism).


You ever heard a socialist say ""lets unite with the capitalists""? 

The fascists fought the socialists in the streets - odd, why would they do that if they were socialists?

1339,"I guess I can expand a bit as I’m living in Budapest. 
Would probably need an hour to go through the history, culture etc. to give you a proper explanation. 
Very very simplied (and my two cents); 
The Magyars came into Europe a bit as an outsider about 1000 years ago. Settled around Budapest. Their own language and customs. Had a “magna carta” of their own before even England but eventually came under Habsburg yolk through their normal marriage scheming. Spent a lot of time fending off Ottoman expansion for the sake of Europe but never really got the recognition they though they deserved. Same went during the Austrian/Habsburg era. Eventually the Hungary became rich and strong enough to force equality in the Austrian rule to became Austria/Hungary. 
Still Europeans never really bothered to care or learn that much about Hungary which always was frustrating. They have had a bit of an underdog complex in Europe because of this, since they actually tried to fit in unlike the majority of Russian history. 
Then came 1848 when they tried to break away into parliamentary democracy but were crushed by Russia/Habsburg/Croatian coalition. 
Both world wars did them dirty and then Soviet oppression. 

All of this makes a country and people pretty prone to nationalism to get through all of this shit. 

Budapest is much much more liberal than the rest of the country and just voted in a green liberal major instead of the Fidesz one. It’s one of Europeans great cities for sure.

Following the partition, an anti-Bulgarian campaign was carried out in the areas under Serbian and Greek control.\[82\] As many as 641 Bulgarian schools and 761 churches were closed by the Serbs, while Exarchist clergy and teachers were expelled.\[82\] The use of all Macedonian dialects and standard Bulgarian were proscribed.\[82\] IMRO, together with local Albanians, organised the Ohrid–Debar uprising against the Serbian rule. Within a few days the rebels captured the towns of Gostivar, Struga and Ohrid, expelling the Serbian troops. According to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace report, a Serbian army of 100,000 regulars suppressed the uprising. Many were killed and tens of thousands refugees fled to Bulgaria and Albania.\[83\]\[84\]

&gt;In the fall of 1915, Bulgaria joined the Central Powers in the First World War and occupied the most of today's North Macedonia.\[82\] After the end of the First World War, the area returned to Serbian control as part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes\[85\] and saw a reintroduction of the anti-Bulgarian measures. Bulgarian teachers and clergy were expelled, Bulgarian language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian organisations dissolved.\[82\]  
&gt;  
&gt;The Serbian government pursued a policy of forced Serbianisation in the region,\[86\]\[87\] which included systematic suppression of Bulgarian activists, altering family surnames, internal colonisation, forced labour, and intense propaganda.\[88\] To aid the implementation of this policy, some 50,000 Serbian army and gendermerie were stationed in North Macedonia.\[82\] By 1940 about 280 Serbian colonies (comprising 4,200 families) were established as part of the government's internal colonisation program (initial plans envisaged 50,000 families settling in North Macedonia).\[82\]

Not to mention that even ""istanbul"" comes  from a Greek phrase. Not that it matters of course but that's where the  song comes from, the jokes about the name. 

Jokes on you for this matter. Still screeching and whining about a fact. Istanbul comes from Islambol actually, then they have changed it to Istanbul. Anyways, it doesn't matter. It's Istanbul, you just cry.

&gt;  
&gt;*The debate over the Aegean islands sparked when the CHP leader  criticized President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Dec. 11 over his failure to  raise the issue of ""18 occupied islands"" during his visit to the  country.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“Why did not you talk about 18 occupied islands? Article 12 and  Article 18 of the Lausanne Treaty were clearly violated. There are  13,000 military units and nearly 5,000 Greek troops on the islands,”  Kılıçdaroğlu said.*

Lol, the new you have sent gives the reason with it. Like Greece always do, they ask more and more troops from Europe and NATO. Also he is a politician and said that during the election to get republicans votes. What about the treaties? Which seems like Greek don't care much.   


&gt;  In 1923, both Greece and Turkey maintained territorial waters of three  nautical miles in the Aegean Sea. Greece extended that to six nautical  miles in 1936 and Turkey followed suit in 1964.   
&gt;  
&gt; ""Although we in Greece say that Turkey is the revisionist actor in that  relationship, Turks say it is Greece because the status quo of  territorial waters in the Aegean is six nautical miles and Greece wants  to expand to 12 nautical miles and change the status quo."" 

The funny part is that you whining about the border vialotions once you don't even obey a fking treaty. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; You're honestly wondering what Turkey is gaining from this? Are you  really so brainwashed that you honestly believe Turkey is there for  protection? What protection? No one is in danger lmao. You guys are such  sheep, no wonder the entire sub is calling you on everything. 

Yeah, nobody is in danger neither in the Aegean See nor on Cyprus island thanks to Turkey. Just beg to Europe with irrelevant subjects to bring more troops over there. Like you do with money to EU, lmao. We, people, should expect more than this from our politicians.

The talks on the MFF are ongoing (in the very earliest stages) but there have been reports looking ahead which all call for simplification and the removal of rebates.

Great Britain accounts for 16% of the EU GDP (Germany 21%, France 15%, Italy 11%) so if the member state contributions stay at around 1.11% of state GDP, there should be a decrease. 

For EU spending to stay the same would require a big increase in spending from countries like Sweden, Denmark the Netherlands and of course Gemany but several member states have indicated their opposition or urged extreme caution.

In the event of a No Deal Brexit there will be massive compensation payments to Irish farmers and potentially North French, Danish and Dutch fishermen (who catch a majority of their fish in UK waters). A deal but paricularly 'No Deal' would also severely and negatively impact Western European eonomies reducing what 1.11% of GDP actually is.

Da, daca vorbesc aromana pe bune, nu o sa ma intelegi pe cat de mult o sa ai impresia ca ma intelegi:)) Explicatia este ca multe cuvinte sunt luate din greaca si turca.

I agree with the fact that Finland has one of the (if not the best) welfare systems in the entire world, but now the government cut like a lot of welfare as well. 

There are homeless people in cold countries, such as Russia and Estonia, Latvia and it can get pretty cold in Hungary as well during the winters. When I was in Hungary I saw so many homeless people. It was crazy and it really made me appreciate Finland like a lot more.

The thing about Russia is that there are parts of Russia where it can get below -50C (Siberia for example) and as far as I know the state doesn't care if you're homeless.

I think I read somewhere that most of the people that are homeless in The US are mentally ill.

I think Finland has a great social welfare system, because they appreciate people as individuals, not because of the winters. I mean the truth is that for the government (every government) we are just statistics. Even in Finland, but like Finnish people have fought a lot for their rights and as like one family. At least that's what we were taught in school and that's what I've heard from older people in general. Even after the Winter War people were mostly like one big family.

1555,"In Hungary, a Freewheeling Trump Ambassador Undermines U.S. Diplomats

He brokered a White House meeting for Hungary’s prime minister. He spends $320,000 on parties and takes positions at odds with American policy. He says he knows what President Trump wants.

By Matt Apuzzo and Benjamin Novak
Oct. 22, 2019

BUDAPEST — The annual Independence Day celebration at the United States Embassy in Budapest is usually a modest garden party, a chance for the ambassador to celebrate American freedom, democracy and the rule of law.

This year, the ambassador, David B. Cornstein, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a blowout gala for 800 guests. He flew in the singer Paul Anka from California. The guest of honor was Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, who has curtailed the very freedoms the event was meant to highlight.

Standing at a lectern, Mr. Cornstein declared Mr. Orban “the perfect partner” and “a very, very strong and good leader.” Mr. Anka serenaded the Hungarian leader with a personalized rendition of “My Way.”

For many in the room, it was a bewildering spectacle: an American ambassador lavishing praise on a far-right leader whose party has methodically eroded Hungarian democracy and pushed anti-Semitic tropes. But it was just another demonstration of Mr. Cornstein’s pattern of emboldening Mr. Orban.

Since becoming ambassador in June 2018, Mr. Cornstein has assiduously courted Mr. Orban, giving the Hungarian leader unexpected influence in the Trump administration. Mr. Cornstein used his decades-long friendship with President Trump to help broker a coveted Oval Office meeting for Mr. Orban last May — a meeting now under scrutiny by impeachment investigators in Washington.

At the time, some White House officials tried to stop the meeting, citing Mr. Orban’s anti-democratic record in Hungary and his growing closeness to Russia. The meeting went ahead, and Mr. Orban is said to have used it to fuel the president’s suspicions about Ukraine.

As yet, Mr. Cornstein’s role in that meeting does not appear to be part of the impeachment inquiry. But his freewheeling diplomacy and courtship of Mr. Orban have alarmed career civil servants and contributed to broader criticism, even among Republicans, that some members of the president’s foreign policy team are dangerously unprepared for the job.

During the past year, Mr. Cornstein, an 81-year-old jewelry magnate, has developed unusually close relationships with Mr. Orban and his advisers, according to several American and Western officials. He exchanges text messages with them, occasionally from personal devices, and boasts about his contacts — even as American security officials warn that Mr. Orban is trying to manipulate him.

He has undermined efforts by career diplomats to deliver messages to Washington about corruption and democratic backsliding in Hungary. And he has privately acted as a broker for Mr. Orban’s point of view, taking positions contrary to United States policy, according to interviews with roughly two dozen current and former American and foreign officials as well as others who have worked with Mr. Cornstein.

He has also adopted some of Mr. Orban’s talking points on Ukraine, contradicting the policy of the United States and its NATO allies.

Some embassy officials were so taken aback that, according to two American officials, they confided to a recent congressional delegation that Washington’s top man in Hungary acted more like Mr. Orban’s top man in the Trump administration.

In two interviews, Mr. Cornstein played down concerns about Hungarian corruption, anti-Semitism and the erosion of democracy. He defended his approach as good for the United States, and said that his outreach to Mr. Orban was exactly what Mr. Trump wanted.

“Hopefully there are one or two people who think I’m doing a good job,” he said.

Mr. Trump seems pleased. Although the Obama administration sought to isolate Mr. Orban as punishment for his authoritarian tendencies, the Trump administration has engaged him uncritically, a strategy intended to keep the Hungarian leader from drifting toward China and Russia.

But Thomas Carothers, who studies democracies for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Mr. Cornstein’s public praise for Mr. Orban had gone too far. “The ambassador has crossed the line, both in openly endorsing bad things and mocking serious issues,” he said.

Privately, Mr. Cornstein has gone even farther.

In April, a group of congressional staff members visited Budapest on a trip sponsored by the Hungarian government. Realizing that Hungarian officials would present a rosy picture, American diplomats squeezed in a 45-minute briefing about corruption and the erosion of democracy.

Mr. Cornstein arrived unannounced and commandeered the meeting, saying he saw no evidence of corruption, according to several people in attendance.

“Before I could start, Cornstein interrupted,” said Miklos Ligeti, a former official at the Hungarian Ministry of Justice who was asked to discuss corruption on behalf of Transparency International. “He came in and hijacked the meeting.”

Mr. Cornstein also spoke glowingly of Mr. Orban’s unchecked power.

“He’s got the executive. He’s got the legislature. And he’s got the judges,” Marta Pardavi, a lawyer with the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights group, recalled the ambassador as saying. “He actually said it. And he said it so we would hear it.”

Mr. Ligeti said he was never able to deliver his corruption briefing.

“Cornstein is the worst, most detrimental of diplomats — not just of the United States, but of all the countries,” Mr. Ligeti said. “He is actively working against the voices of anticorruption.”

In interviews, Mr. Cornstein said he did not recall the meeting but played down corruption concerns.

“Is there corruption in Hungary? I’m sure there is,” Mr. Cornstein said. “Is there corruption in New York City and Chicago? I’m sure there is.” He said he had seen no evidence of an effect on American businesses.

State Department and private analysts, however, say that corruption is persistent in Hungary. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has pledged to increase support for anti-corruption efforts in Hungary.

**A Dispute with Ukraine**

It may not seem obvious how, or why, a Hungarian prime minister would influence the views of an American president toward Ukraine, an American ally.

But Mr. Orban has been locked in a dispute with Ukrainian officials over a language law that he says is discriminatory to ethnic Hungarians in Ukraine. The dispute has become a key security issue for the United States because Mr. Orban has blocked Ukrainian engagement with NATO. The United States is adamant that such disagreements should have no bearing on NATO security matters.

The White House meeting gave Mr. Orban the opportunity to press his case directly to Mr. Trump. Asked on Tuesday what Mr. Orban told the president about Ukraine, Mr. Cornstein replied, “It was between two men, and neither person discussed the subject with me.”

But Mr. Cornstein’s statements on the topic have recently drifted toward Mr. Orban’s point of view. Asked about Ukraine in an interview, he raised the language law unprompted.

“The language law that was passed, which was not favorable to the 175,000 Ukrainian, former Hungarian people that are living in that part of the country, was something that I didn’t agree with,” Mr. Cornstein said.

Mr. Cornstein also took Mr. Orban’s side over the fate of Central European University, an accredited institution that Mr. Orban forced from the country. The Hungarian-born philanthropist George Soros founded the school after the collapse of the Soviet Union, in part to educate a new generation on the principles of human rights and the rule of law. As he eroded democratic norms, Mr. Orban attacked Mr. Soros, portraying him as part of a global conspiracy against the prime minister.

Publicly, Mr. Cornstein declared that saving the school was a top priority. But privately, he helped broker the university’s exit, according to the school’s president, Michael Ignatieff.

Mr. Ignatieff said that Mr. Cornstein had proposed that the school move its American degree program to Vienna and keep a smaller, Hungarian-only program in Budapest.

“What do you care where your degrees are issued?” Mr. Ignatieff recalled Mr. Cornstein as saying.

“David, that’s not a compromise,” Mr. Ignatieff replied. “You’re kicking a U.S. institution out of Hungary.”

“I don’t see it that way at all,” Mr. Cornstein said.

The university soon lost its authority to issue American degrees and moved to Vienna — the very outcome Mr. Cornstein had mentioned. The United States Embassy said in a statement that the government was “disappointed.”

**A Strongman Inside the European Union**

The university’s expulsion was another example of Mr. Orban’s vast influence over Hungarian political life. His party, Fidesz, has cemented control of the media, curtailed religious freedom, endorsed racial and cultural purity and used anti-Semitic stereotypes to attack the European Union. (State Department reports have cited Mr. Orban’s utilization of anti-Semitism.)

Mr. Cornstein, who is Jewish, often says that Hungary’s biggest problem is public relations and that Jews in Hungary have little to worry about.

“They’re content. They’re happy and they’re safe,” he said. “I can’t say that about New York City.”

Other American presidents have been accused of supporting strongmen. But Mr. Trump has broken with a half-century of bipartisan consensus that supporting freedom was a moral imperative and a security goal, said Larry Diamond of the Hoover Institution, a conservative research group.",Nino G is my homeboy,/r/europe/comments/dlvgx4/in_hungary_a_freewheeling_trump_ambassador/f4ujvev/,vernazza,1571814009

1560,"&gt; “Orban has quietly and skillfully, with velvet gloves, strangled the life out of democracy,” Mr. Diamond said. “To embrace and normalize and look away from these transgressions in a country that is in the heart of the liberal democratic project of the world is not only disturbing. It’s alarming.”
&gt; 
&gt; Friends say that Mr. Cornstein, an affable grandfather, is a Rockefeller Republican, not an ideologue. He has donated not only to the presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney and John McCain, but also to Democrats like Chuck Schumer and Cory Booker.
&gt; 
&gt; He did not give money to Mr. Trump’s campaign, but the friendship between the two men goes back decades. Mr. Cornstein attended Mr. Trump’s wedding and ran New York City’s off-track-gambling operation in the mayoral administration of Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is now Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Cornstein made his fortune operating jewelry counters inside department stores, and he often recounts stories of hard-won wisdom from his business career. Running an embassy is a lot like running a jewelry counter, he says: You can’t forget you’re in someone else’s store.
&gt; 
&gt; Some American officials and Western diplomats say that Mr. Cornstein is falling for a Hungarian campaign to undermine veteran foreign policy officials. At the White House, for example, Mr. Orban told Mr. Trump that the embassy in Budapest — staffed by career civil servants — was full of Obama administration holdovers, according to Mr. Cornstein and other American officials.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Trump responded by asking why Mr. Cornstein had not fired them. (In an interview, Mr. Cornstein said he had confidence in his staff.)
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Cornstein is open about his closeness to Mr. Orban. He tells how, on the flight back to Budapest after the White House meeting, the two men — exhausted from a long day — stripped to their underwear and napped and chatted on couches in the back of Mr. Orban’s plane.
&gt; 
&gt; When Mr. Cornstein learned recently that Radio Free Europe, the pro-democracy American news outlet, was preparing to return to Hungary, he sought assurances that it would not criticize Mr. Orban’s government. In an interview, he said he simply wanted to ensure that the government viewpoint would be included.
&gt; 
&gt; It is hardly unusual for diplomats to seek ties with foreign leaders, but Mr. Cornstein has eschewed both the rigorous prep sessions that normally precede high-level contacts and the detailed briefings that follow. State Department officials say they often do not know what messages are exchanged.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Cornstein acknowledged that he rarely speaks to officials in Washington. He conceded that he has used personal devices to contact Mr. Orban and his advisers, but said he had done so a half-dozen times at most, and only to set up meetings.
&gt; 
&gt; “I was told this before I got to the post: ‘This is your show. You run it,’” he said. “I know what the president’s philosophy is and what his foreign policy is.”
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Cornstein has delivered mixed results, at best. He regards as an achievement negotiations that are underway, but not finalized, for Hungary to buy more than $1 billion in American weaponry.
&gt; 
&gt; Yet Mr. Orban has also allowed an obscure Russian financial institution, the International Investment Bank, to open in Budapest with sweeping diplomatic immunity — a move that Western security officials say enables Russian spying and money laundering.
&gt; 
&gt; After a Drug Enforcement Administration sting captured two men thought to be Russian arms dealers, Hungarian officials extradited them to Russia, where they were set free. Hungary has also snubbed Washington by saying that it sees no evidence that the Chinese telecom giant Huawei is a security threat.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Cornstein said that building bridges was a process, one that will help the United States. He denied honoring Mr. Orban at the Independence Day gala.
&gt; 
&gt; “My motivation was to really show what a great party can be,” he said, “and have people walk out and say, ‘Man, America really did that terrific.’”
&gt; 
&gt; He said the party cost about $320,000, financed mostly by American businesses. An additional $7,000 came from an embassy account used to establish local contacts.
&gt; 
&gt; During the interview, Mr. Cornstein appeared to nudge American policy in another new direction. He said he had vehemently opposed the Russian bank’s relocation but that Mr. Orban had made private promises that have allayed his concerns.
&gt; 
&gt; “I am comfortable with where we are now,” Mr. Cornstein said. Pressed on whether that was the official view of the United States government, he replied: “You’ve got to ask Washington. I’m comfortable.”
&gt; 
&gt; The embassy quickly clarified his remarks, saying the ambassador considered the bank a threat as long as it remained in Hungary.",Nino G is my homeboy,/r/europe/comments/dlvgx4/in_hungary_a_freewheeling_trump_ambassador/f4ujw2p/,vernazza,1571814034

Besides,  teachers have a bias that does promote girls over boys:

&gt; The key finding is that teachers’ gender biases have a high and significant effect on girls’ progress relative to boys’ in both math and literacy. Over middle school, teachers’ gender bias against boys explains 21 percent of boys falling behind girls in math. Although students who are assigned a more biased teacher in grade 6 are more likely to be reassigned the same teacher in grade 7, boys’ relative progress is not lower for these students. Moving to other outcomes, I find that having a teacher who is one SD more biased in math increases girls’ probability to select a scientific track in high school by 2.7 percentage points compared to boys’. Teachers’ average bias in math contributes to a reduction of 11.7 percent of the gender gap in choosing scientific courses.

Finally, a country where guns are not only seen as a right but a simple tool used by good people defensively will not only lead to more criminals arming themselves but the police being armed as well. Not only does arming the police compromise freedom but they are policing in a world where anyone they run into may be potentially armed.

Being sailor and cartographer are not mutually inclusive. Considering the scarcity of knowledge of the time compiling a map from other works counts as research in my book. 

I am not sure OP's map is his work (definitely not Arabic though), but claiming that it is not his by comparing with his Atlantic map is dumb imo. Dude can have multiple maps at different time points.

Therefore, NATO countries that do not declare neutrality in the event of a conflict will be destroyed, even if Russia dies next.

1844,"&gt;You are unlikely to survive a Finnish winter outside with temperatures down to -30 degrees celsius.

I live in Siberia, similar winters, but we have homeless people. I've seen one particular dude in my area for 5-7 years, one lad for at least 3 years. So unless there are some factors that make surviving in Finland worse than surviving in a Siberian city with 1.5kk population, it's not really true. Being homeless in the winter not fun at all, but it's possible.

That being said, I can think of at least one reason why it might be harder in Finland. Most of the people in Russian cities live in a high rise apartment buildings, something along the lines of Pruitt-Igoe and other mass housing projects. Usually they are 8-9 floors, but there are big portion of 5 floors, built in the early 60s. These buildings have basements, and because we have central heating and water pipes coming from there, it's not that cold in the winter. I think it's one of the possible ways homeless people can save themselves from freezing. Usually entries are closed, but I guess homeless find the way. There are also places where heating main pipes go above the ground, it also can be used. They even build some kind of huts there sometimes.

There is also an option of going into a main building corridor, not sure how to call it in English, space between front door and door to your flat, with stairs and elevator. But it's easy to be kicked out in that case.

So, from what I've seen, Europe in general is more low-rise, and I think at the very least it would make it harder for homeless people to get to the basements, if there even would be any. And it would be harder to get to the inside corridor, as I imagine.",,/r/europe/comments/dli2hl/finnish_park_benches/f4tudza/,Ofcyouare,1571793753

1847,"I'm sorry, but you're simply incorrect. What you describe is an unscientific view of sex, not gender. And even if you described sex, it is overly simplified to the point of just being wrong. You can't cleanly divide every human into ""male"" and ""female"" as you claim. Biology and medicine certainly doesn't support that claim – there are millions of people who aren't ""male"" or ""female"" genetically, and there are tens of millions who don't have a ""male"" or ""female"" phenotype due to gene expression, steroid insensitivity, or other causes. Again: **Biology does not say that there are only males and females**.

However, gender isn't the same as sex. It's a concept that's only very loosely connected. You are free to argue that this concept isn't useful, but it's not the same as sex. 

To explain some things that seem to confuse you: trans people don't ""change their gender"". A trans-man already *is* a man. It doesn't matter how his genitals look, how they looked at his birth, what his hormone levels are, or how many X and Y chromosomes he has. Appearance, genital appearance and hormone levels can be changed medically, but their gender does not change.

I know it sounds silly that someone could just change their gender based on how they feel. But it sounds silly because it is a silly, incorrect version of what happens.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/dlimkl/political_map_of_great_britain_old_vs_young_65_vs/f4tv9hd/,atyon,1571793998

More specifically, if you believe innovation and entrepreneur are critical for a more prosperous society, the fact that Spain isn't doing that well in gdp means Spain probably isn't doing that well on those departments either. 

In practice though a lot of inaccuracies happen when we try to present this gdp figure, which is why we make different kind of adjustments to the data. The PPP adjustment in particular is there to try to make gdp figures of different regions comparable.

It was the family's wish for him to be buried in the Almuneda Cathedral next to the royal palace but the Supreme Court did not agree for safety measures and to avoid potentiel demonstrations.
  What is ironic though is that the pantheon of El Pardo Mingorrubio in which Franco will be buried - next to his wife that was buried there in 1988 - was build with 11.5 million old pesetas in the late 60's (If my memory is correct) taken from a government fund dedicated to the unemployed workers.

On the opposite, there's real debate in r/SpainPolitics regarding Catalonia independence, which is way more civilized than in here. There many Catalan pro-independence and Spanish unionists discuss in a civilized manner and agree on many things. Redditors there are much more honest.

&gt;One  tank commander reported, ""for the entire time I was in Kosovo, I never  saw an enemy soldier and my unit was never once involved in firing at  enemy targets. The tanks which cost $2.5 million each were used to  slaughter Albanian children... I am ashamed"".

For all we know this could be American propaganda, or quotation by a bribed soldier. That's why you can't use such things as arguments.

&gt;Also what is so funny about what I said? What was the motivation of NATO  in this conflict other then to save lives? It would have been really  easy to do nothing.

[Yeah, saving lives.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grdelica_train_bombing) Like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_bombing_of_the_Radio_Television_of_Serbia_headquarters) or like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bombing_of_the_Chinese_embassy_in_Belgrade)?

Finland has managed to reduce emmissions over 1990 while Niger's have nearly doubled. This coupled with runaway population growth that will see Niger have up to 100.000.000 people by 2100 means that it is quite likely that the it will overtake Finland for emmissions during our lifetimes if current economic development trends continue.

&gt; So to all the people who downvoted: what's wrong with you?

Not sure that's often the case. It seems like a typical case of abuse is when a close one or a relative  is touching a minor while nobody is watching. Usually without penetration. So you end up with the word against word, where the kid usually don't even remember the details like marks and scars.

Not very familiar with how such cases are conducted, but I believe that's what they do: push harder and take the accuser's side. After all the report doesn't mention if they push the victim in presence of strong evidence, and how do they do it (not sure if this is the proper way to conduct an investigation, though, but knowing how the police and prosecution work, it's definitely the easiest one).

&gt;Charges of vaginal rape were made in 88 cases, and oral and/or anal sodomy in 67 cases. Physical evidence was present in only 23% of all cases that resulted in felony convictions. Felony convictions were obtained in 67 (79%) of 85 cases without physical evidence and in only 20 (67%) of 30 cases with physical evidence.

Yet there is Swahili spoken in Kenya and other countries as a zonal language among the common folk instead of English - which is also taught in schools but people prefer to talk in Swahili with people who don't speak their language, for example, Kikuyu - there is about 60 languages spoken in Kenya, by the way.

2099,"He never said anything like that. He says a lot of stupid things so I dunno why western media keeps trying to lie about the shit he said.


Here is the conference he talked about nuclear powers.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KP5awBT4JQ


Its Turkish of course but he talks about it around 11 minute mark. He is talking about how ""developed"" countries all have nuclear missiles but aren't letting anyone else make them. He also says that one of the politicians, he is not yet PM he says,(?) he visited said ""They talk about this nuclear that nuclear about me but I only have 7000 nuclear warheads while US, Russia has 15000 nuclear warheads. I will also make them."" So they are in this battle racing each other while holding everyone else off telling ""No don't do it."". He also says Israel keep threatening other with nuclear power and overall it is not fair for ""developed"" countries to do this.


He ends the speech with something like ""We are working on ..."" but connects it with S-400 so it doesn't necessarily mean they are working on developing a nuclear warhead. If anything it is quite impossible for Turkey to work on developing nuclear warheads while keeping it secret so I would suggest that is not true. Sure you can interpret this as him wanting to get nuclear warheads but it is not clear at all. At no point he says ""We are going to develop nuclear warheads"", ""I want nuclear weapons."" or anything resembling that.


Knowing Erdogan, if there is even a little tiny possibility of that, he would scream out his lungs and make it a huge advertisement for his party as well. They would talk about it on the TV for days, the nuclear warhead would get a name and it would be plastered all over the country as well. So I don't think there is a clear agenda for that for now. 


I would suggest people to think a bit about these type of sensationalist articles and take them with a grain of salt. Especially with the recent ""Attack on Kurdish civilians"" video from ABC, ""We are ready to go to war against Turkey"" interview from CNBC or many other bullshit articles on how Turkey is ""literally holding US nukes hostage."" from Guardian(?) etc.


Nukes in Turkey are from like 1960 and highly irrelevant. Turkey has no access to them nor any means to activate them. Literally one intern from The Guardian was googling one day and found out that Turkey held US nukes thought it would make good news with a twist. US could take those nukes in a second and Turkey wouldn't even care because they are nothing but a bother. Any decent above average IQ strategist would tell you that having US nukes in Turkey is in favor of US if anything. Though clearly Guardian's minimum wage working interns doesn't realize that.


Lastly I just want to remind you guys that you are being milked by the media by the latest scare. Personally it was a shock for me because even though I knew they had their biases I wouldn't think the most prominent western media agencies like NYTimes, CNBC, Guardian or even BBC would lower themselves to the levels of sensationalist clickbait bullshit.

&gt;  
&gt;destiny. Then I look at alien passports. Then I look at Kaljulaid (and others) statements.

I actually don't see how any of these are related to the topic.

&gt;Then I look at estonian MFA getting butthurt over documents release and commemoration of liberation of Tallin.

It's called ""liberation"" only in Russia. In Estonia, it's known as Soviet re-conquer of Tallinn.

&gt;Who exactly resisted? Forest bandits, ex-helpers of Finnish-Nazi invasion on North?

Yes, them, and a lot of former officials. Also, Finland had a right to defend itself from Soviet invasion.

&gt;What about those who didn't resist socialist model or supported it?

There weren't many of those left after they had experienced one year of Soviet rule from 1940 to 1941. They had gone from a functional Republic of Estonia to a totalitarian dictatorship where millions of peasants had died from starvation just a few years ago due to massive mismanagement. Tens of thousands of Estonians were deported to Siberia. All kind of journalism ended. People were jailed and murdered extrajudicially or in kangaroo courts.

&gt;What about those who died in concentration camps or fighting on Red Army side?

[This](https://klooga.nazismvictims.ee/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/HMK_F_434_Klooga-postkaart-1965.jpg) is a Holocaust memorial in Estonia during Soviet times, [this](https://www.hm.ee/sites/default/files/styles/1024x/public/news-cover-images/klooga.jpg?itok=S3gvzvy3) is the same now. The Soviet one had no mention of Jews, it exploited the horrible events to do state propaganda and wrote simply ""murdered Soviet citizens"", even though these people had almost nothing to do with Soviet Union. In Republic of Estonia, the plaque was changed to mention straightforwardly that these were Jews murdered by nazis. For some reason, I think the victims prefer the latter.

For people fighting on Red Army side, if they were forcefully drafted, I don't think they would have supported that country. If not, well, they made their choice, they wouldn't be loyal to Estonia anymore.

2193,"&gt;It’s sad that a young gay man/teen that would have grown up to be a happy gay man is now forced through peer pressure to put on a dress, you are literally experimenting on young children, pure satanic evil.

Nobody is forced to do anything here. This is again right wing propaganda. The point of the whole fourth wave feminism thing is that nobody should be forced to do anything. If a gay men doesn't want to wear a dress more power to him. If a gay men does want to wear a dress but is shunned for it, that is bad. You have this pre-conceived notion in your head of what gender neutral means that is totally wrong and not based on what 'the left' actually thinks. 

&gt;The moment you told an entire generation of youths that gender is a social oppressive construct

It is a social oppressive construct though, and that is supported by science. I refer to my earlier example of women not being allowed to wear pants by society. Why? that makes no sense at all. Doesn't mean woman should be forced to wear pants. But if they like to and feel comfortable that way why not? the same with men and dresses.

&gt;hates borders and nations

Borders are bad though. I like staring at them but what use do they serve? They do what you (wrongly) think the left does with gender neutral daycares, putting people in arbitrary boundaries that make no sense. This is not uniquely left wing though, right wing often supports open borders since it means a better and larger free market. 

&gt;hates capitalism

This isn't 1950 anymore Communism is death in most Western countries. Only the far-left is against capitalism. That is like saying all right wing are neo-nazis because of the far-right.

&gt;wants to imports millions that hate our way of life

Nobody wants to import anyone(except in the 1960's from Turkey and Morroco, but mind you that was a *right wing* initiative). Refugees are a real issue. They can not stay at home and are displaced by war and/or natural disasters and have no home. It would be inhumane to not take them in. But you know if some right wing politicians hadn't advocated for war in the first places these refugees would be a non-issue. The left wants those refugees, just as much as the right, away from here when Syria, or wherever they came from, is safe again. 

&gt;thinks there are 500 genders and cutting dicks of children is acceptable

This has nothing to do with the left, maybe in Greece not here in the Netherlands. Here left parties are the only ones opposing circumcision. No one thinks there are 500 genders, again right wing misinformation to discredit leftism. 

&gt;ok to love your nation and history,

The left does this to. What incredibly biased media do you consume that you have this warped view of reality? It is also important to recognize the flaws in ones history, something the right doesn't want to do but the left does. Nazis, slavery, colonialism that is not something to be loved. You learn more from your mistakes then your wins. It is okay to love your nation and be proud of it, as long as it doesn't devolve into thinking your nation is superior then others. No nation is superior then others. You aren't superior then others just because you were born in a certain place by certain parents.

&gt;that there are 2 natural genders

This is wrong though, Hermaphrodites are real [medical disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermaphrodite#Humans) any medical professional will tell you that. There are also organisms which are Hermaphrodites without it being a disorder. What you are talking about seems to be that there are normally just Males and Females. Also something which the left does not deny. It is psycholigically where someone might not feel comfortable with either being male or female, people which the left wants not to have lynched, but people like you are ready to lynch them.

But the EU has indeed failed. Mostly because most of the (especially right wing and conservative) politics only see the EU as a tool to enforce economic interests.

2405,"Dude, chams who were supported by Italian fascists at first and then German Nazis, collaborated with them during the occupation of Greece, they were responsible for the deaths of many Greeks because of this collaboration. This and the fact that they openly supported Albanian troops taking parts of Thesprotia, made EDES to do what they did, both killing many Chams and also driving many of them to leave Greece. 

At that time EDES was working by itself, with no connections to an official government or state. After the independence the state was more concerned about the civil war , than anything else, so it didnt bother itself with things like this. Zervas became a necessary pawn for a political system that was essentially supported by the Americans and the British, as a means to an end. 

As I told you, the massacre was wrong , but even now the official state opinion is that the massacre was wrong,  it was not recognized as a state delivered action and the Chams are not seen in general as good, because many people died. 

Most of the greek ""propaganda "" here is drawing parallels between the invasion of Syria and the way the Turkish state handles the Kurdish issue , with the invasion in Cyprus, the EEZ and FIR infidges,  as well as a constant threat because of the expansionist and aggressive stance of Turkey. 

Greece hasn't ignored its faults and I have tried to explain that to you. You just cannot understand that the chams incident had nothing to do with a government or the state at the time or after. 

Greeks in Thessaloniki when the wars started in Yugoslavia, stopped many American vehicles from going , they entered greek and amerixna bases and threw arms and ammo in the Thermaikos gulf etc.   Again you do not want to understand because yo are preoccupied with your opinions",Greece,/r/europe/comments/dl4icc/turkish_drone_caught_spying_over_greek_islands/f4q67bt/,notsocommon_folk,1571748576

2519,"Due to its federal structure, the EU cannot become an empire like the US. In fact, it's a union of sovereign states to defend against imperialism - both internally  and externally. Is that good or bad? 

People may be impatient with the apparent lack of power or decisiveness in the EU, but in the end, it is not what you or I want in the moment that will be the best in the end. For example, the EU would never have been able of making the disastrous decision of invading Iraq. The US can do that. And how did that work out? For the US, it may have been the worst decision ever. Aside from the loss of life and money, the US lost in influence while Iran and Russia gained and a whole region was thrown into chaos. Internationally, it has destroyed the narrative of the ""benevolent superpower"" and substantially damaged US soft power. Whatever the US claims now, people always reply: where are Saddam's WMDs?

Without doing a thing, the EU's reputation has received a tremendous boost from the Brexit debacle. The Chinese have the concept of Tao and of virtue, which work in mysterious ways by non-action. In the age of right-wing populism and extremism, the EU is the last defense of liberal democracy, human rights and the rule of law. 

What people often don't realize is that politics is dynamic and not static. In other words, people often end up with something different than what they aimed for. Extreme nationalism, for example, is almost always damaging to the nation. The nationalists obviously don't intend to damage their nation, they just don't understand the dynamics of politics. 

The EU is based on consensus politics which by its very nature stays clear of the extremes. It sometimes takes time to come to a decision, but that is the essence of democratic decision making. When the core interests of the EU are concerned, as in the Brexit case, the EU is capable of tremendously swift and decisive action. Do we need the same swift and decisive action for interfering in the conflict between Turks and Kurds, for example? I don't think so. By massively interfering on one side, we risk aggravating the situation.

Turkey and Turkish society is far weaker, they cannot send people into space, they couldn't develop a GPS equivalent like Glonass, they cannot develop big ticket military hardware, their country cannot attract or maintain client states -- but the Turkish elite and public are very quick to anger and use force.

They also called their past military invasion against Cyprus, the Cyprus Peace Operation!

Western elites fear Russian potential as geopolitical competitor.

2566,"""Subject to the EU"", the most effete, toothless bloc in all of history. You and your WW2-inspired narratives of European malevolence are playing the country straight into the hands of far worse powers. 

We could have cut a sweet deal within the EU, an associate membership, retained influence within the trading bloc, maintained the benefits of the trade deals, opted out of all further integration initiatives, controlled EU immigration by actually bothering to enforce the existing regulations that allow unproductive EU-nationals to be sent home.

We could have continued to grow both economically and population-wise eventually becoming most important economic engine in the European Union and nobody could have done fuck all about it. 

Instead now we will be like Chile, the US's and China's trade bitch required to implement ever more extreme neolib policies that allow foreigners to get rich off exploiting pseudo-markets in what should be nationalised industries. They can't wait to divvy up the NHS even it remains free at the point of service to deplete our national coffers for their exploitative pharma interests. 

It's a bizarre world you live in where you think the EU are the scary bad guys and getting a trade deal with Trump is something good. Ask any nation whose economy is dependent on US good will and you'll see that those guys don't play fair when dealing with any nation at a strategic disadvantage. 

Honestly, the fact that such absurd narratives have won over the British public is just testament to how low we've sunk in terms of education. Fat-headed working class bores sitting in pristine all-white living rooms in front of 50 inch flat screens have become to the controlling class. Crass materialists with no taste, no feeling, and not art. Where are the noble English now? 

Here, have a poem that sums up the Brexit supporters quite nicely:

&gt;Come friendly bombs and fall on Slough!
It isn't fit for humans now,
There isn't grass to graze a cow.
Swarm over, Death!
Come, bombs and blow to smithereens
Those air -conditioned, bright canteens,
Tinned fruit, tinned meat, tinned milk, tinned beans,
Tinned minds, tinned breath.

&gt;Mess up the mess they call a town-
A house for ninety-seven down
And once a week a half a crown
For twenty years.

&gt;And get that man with double chin
Who'll always cheat and always win,
Who washes his repulsive skin
In women's tears:

&gt;And smash his desk of polished oak
And smash his hands so used to stroke
And stop his boring dirty joke
And make him yell.

&gt;But spare the bald young clerks who add
The profits of the stinking cad;
It's not their fault that they are mad,
They've tasted Hell.

&gt;It's not their fault they do not know
The birdsong from the radio,
It's not their fault they often go
To Maidenhead

&gt;And talk of sport and makes of cars
In various bogus-Tudor bars
And daren't look up and see the stars
But belch instead.

&gt;In labour-saving homes, with care
Their wives frizz out peroxide hair
And dry it in synthetic air
And paint their nails.

&gt;Come, friendly bombs and fall on Slough
To get it ready for the plough.
The cabbages are coming now;

2758,"\&gt; Can you imagine how terrible a system it would be if every matter was left unfixed for a decade? At 10y intervals you'd never get all members on the same page.   


What I mean is referendums are a tool of direct democracy, when you make the people vote on a matter, you can't just make them re-vote 2 years after. You need to wait a little bit else it fels like you're making them revote again and again until you get the ""good result"". How would you feel if one year after a PM was elected, people had to revote because "" the context has changed""?   


\&gt;"" How are democratic exercises a threat to democracy? ""   


Changing a few words, keeping 90% of the text and Applying it  2 years later despite it tbeing rejected by referendum is NOT a democratic exercise. And i'll add, using only the MP to vote such a crucial text ( Lisbonn) while many countries had either voted NO too in 2005 or had a negative/mixed up public opinion is sketchy at best. Clearly antidemocratic at worst.  


\&gt; Then maybe you should provide a source that says so instead of providing one that talks about a new text.   


Dude I did but didnt read very far did you? True it's in French. Source is l'Humanité, a very reliable and respected French newspaper : So here we go again :  [https://www.humanite.fr/node/381089](https://www.humanite.fr/node/381089)   
Now the important part of the article (directly translated by Deep L ) :   


""By changing the name of the text, the Head of State (Nicolas Sarkozy)is trying to make them believe that this new treaty has nothing to do with the European constitution, 55% of which they rejected in 2005. A real scam that the father of the deceased TCE, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, himself acknowledges: ""***In the Lisbon Treaty, drafted exclusively on the basis of the draft Constitutional Treaty(TCE), the tools are exactly the same. Only the order has been changed in the toolbox. The box itself has been redecorated, using an old model, which has three lockers in which you have to search to find what you are looking for,""*** he explained in an evening newspaper."" 

Valéry Giscard d'Estaing was the main writter of the 2005 TCE. He knows his shit. But please stop being of bad faith, the fact that the 2005 text and the Lisbon treaty are basically the same is a wide known fact, even acknowledged by very pro EU people. It's not a secret nor a plot : this is public knowledge.  
So yeah, not a very democratic process when then you use such treaty to forbid specific domestic policies.  


And we could go further, let's take Maastricht ! Now it was sketchy here and there but for the sake of the argument let's say it was adopted everywhere in a democratic manner. We are almost 30 years later, and some EU countries are prevented to enact several sets of policies ( monetary, budgetary etc) because they have to respect it. Renegociation is completely impossible at this point. For how long can you keep telling one people : "" we can't because Maastricht, and we can't renegociate because making the 28 to agree on a change is basically mathematically impossible?"". You are effectively robbing people of their ability to choose their own destinity as a nation.   
For someone like you that advocates for a 2nd referendum that's ironic. Did'nt the context change in 30 years? For how many generations should the people be locked in place by a piece of paper? For what? The ""European Ideal""? I like this ideal but if it is afraid of tearing off a piece of paper it's not a good sign to begin with.   
Don't forget that, ultimately, 100% of the EU democratic legitimity comes from the Nation-States, not somewhere else. Until this situation changes, you should ""tread lightly"" when it comes to sovereignity&amp;Democratic matters inside each country.   
Which leads us to...   


\&gt;Why stop at the national level? Why not have the village council vote on international treaties?

Let's face it, there's a European Parliament in which all EU-citizens can vote and there's a Council of the leaders of each member state (voted by the people). The democratic power is nicely &amp; reasonably distributed across all levels.  


And I would tend to agree with you on this one. Yeah if it's well done and democratically accepted, let's go! But until then....Well see above.   
And also, when I see all the fuss about the scots wanting to leave the UK because of Brexit, or Catalonia etc, I really wonder how things would go if for example Germans voted for someone but the guy going 3rd was elected mainky thanks to southern Europe and Greece and tried to force them to pay, this sort of things. As a french i'm pretty sure we would riot the fuck out if some dude that was'nt the first choice of the country ruled over us. Buuuut i'm going off tracks.  


\&gt; Any deal will be worse than what they currently enjoy though   


I think you're, like most of the remain campaign btw, are too focused on the economic side of things. It's not just about economics. It's also cultural&amp;political.   
But even on the economic side, as I said in a previous comment, millions and millions of people have actually seen their wages go down, their life expectancy droped, unemployement killing their neighborhoods. It has happened all over Europe, and mayne it would have happened without. But surely you can understand how useless it is to tell these people "" Oh look at the GDP and the growth ! oh man we're going to loose a big chunk of it if we leave ;) "".

What influences bigger difference in wages than nominal GDP per capita suggests is different share of population employed. In some countries it's 60% (Romania), in other it's 80% (Sweden) of people in working age. 

There is no earnings transfer visible by the evil Western corporations from Czechia. If salaries are lower than nominal GDP per capita, then it's because higher taxation of work (direct and indirect) and lower share of population actively working. (Of course there are exception, Luxemburg is a small tax paradise so the ratio is distorted)

But if it is under a lot of tension... it becomes stretchy.

So how do you solve a foreskin that is too tight? You pull it back. As much as you can. Every day several times. Within 2 weeks I could peel it back all the way (although getting it back on again was a pain). 2 weeks later, it was all absolutely no problem.

&gt;The Slavs took advantage of the desolation left by the nomadic tribes and in the 6th century settled the Balkan Peninsula.

They invaded Macedonia and reached as far south as Thessaly and the Peloponnese, settling in isolated regions that were called by the Byzantines Sclavinias, until they were gradually pacified. At the beginning of the 9th century, the Slavic Bulgarian Empire conquered Northern Byzantine lands, including most of Macedonia.

What made you point out the cities you did?

Why would you choose the city limits as the benchmark when

The public facing cia.gov data is composed by a bunch of mouthbreathers with janitorial degrees (props to all janitors, you're the real agents). 

Compare just these three:

    Berlin city/state area is 891 km2 with 3.75m population (see: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin) with the metro population of 6m people. In 1920, the Greater Berlin act increased the size of the city from 66km2 to 883km2. And thus the population by a great deal. 

    Paris city area is 105km2 with 2.14m population (see: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris) but with the metro population of 12.4m people. 

    St. Petersburg is 1439km2 with the population of 5.35m people and ""metro"" of 6m people (see: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint Petersburg).


The same differences can be said about every city in Europe. It depends on how the city has decided to measure its boundaries. Historically it's been up to each and every one of them to do that. You decided to omit a half of the largest cities in Europe without any semblance of explanation of your methodology. If you had any, to begin with.

It's your onus to explain why your post sucks so much.

Again, the hardest thing to do is to find how many people live in a city during the day and how many sleep there at night. Minus the hotels. That information is practically unavailable. Unless you have a vested interest in it.

The problem with the 50%+1% is that it is within error margin, so the majority could well be supporting the other side. Depending on what is being voted on, different majority rules are used, but since this was a referendum, you can pretty much set any arbitrary majority rule (because referendums are not about letting the people decide as it is commonly suggested, but rather serve as a way to inform the government about how the populace feels/thinks about a certain issue; this means that the government can ignore the outcome even if 70+% votes unanimously on an issue).

&gt; Let's say this Tory government gave the people a choice (it doesn't matter what) but said 66% of the population must agree on it. They would very much be making sure the change does not take place, they would go unchallenged, and the people would feel the system is flawed. 

Your premise is invalid but whatever. If 66% must agree on it, then it means it needs serious discussion (which obviously will take years) until the general populace can decide that it is in their best interest to ask for a change in policy. However, this whole scenario is nonsense, because this is exactly what the MPs jobs are: to discuss these issues and decide FOR the people who elected them out of TRUST.

There is in fact a blatant sleight of hand in this because of the pretension that ""the people voted, and this is a democracy"", while the MPs should have discussed the pros and cons of a Brexit and make sure that THERE IS A PLAN IF BREXIT HAPPENS before giving a referendum. As much as it feels like a good ego trip to go and vote regarding a certain policy as a mundane person in a referendum: you're not an MP and you are probably part of the majority that isn't well informed on the context of the issue/policy, so no one will seriously care about your vote unless there is an agenda to it could be used for.

Trust me, you do not want to buy an apartment in Moscow right now. The housing market is going to collapse. It's all dependent on a constant flow of young people moving to Moscow. As soon as this ends, housing prices are going to fall. 

Not only that, but you just have tons and tons and tons of new apartments being built. Sure you can buy an apartment now, but you won't be able to sell it. Why would some other Russian buy it from you, when they can get a brand new apartment in another novostroika that was just built? 

Cheap housing is the problem in Moscow. If the government actually added some zoning laws that limtied the amount of new apartment complexes that could be built, then prices would go up, and people would stop moving. 

It would be Muscovites that would benefit, because the apartments they own would go up in value. 

Now the apartments they own are falling in value, or are not nearly as high as they could be, because new housing keeps getting built. 

In a properly functioning housing market, you buy an apartment in a really shitty neighborhood and wait for it to gentrify. If you pick correctly, you benefit immensely. 

That's how all of the inner city ghettos in the United States right now are gentrifying.

No. Those are some characteristics of fascism, not the ""core"".

Fascism is about a one-party state, complete mobilisation of the nation, and ""cleansing"" ""degeneracy"".
But there are parts that are simply entirely incompatible with leftist economics - for instance, fascism is entirely class agnostic: while fascists are usually relatively left-leaning in terms of welfare (for those who qualify as ""real"" citizens to them), class warfare is seen as a distraction; they seek a unified state. Leftism is entirely about class warfare. A fascist doesn't care about inequality unless they deem it to be detrimental to society as a whole (which it is, hence why fascists often seem ""left""ish here). Actual leftists, however, have class equality as a *central* piece of their ideology.

Build more tram lines, put some of them underground (especially in highly build-up city center), raise their speed, lower density of stops, couple two units together to raise capacity, set up tram preference on intersections with traffic lights... this, combined with suburban S-bahn trains (which we already have) could make backbone of public transport until we grow and get more population density to make classic heavy metro sustainable.",Slovakia,/r/europe/comments/dkzqzn/year_of_opening_of_the_first_subway_line_in/f4mcsy8/,blackwe11_ninja,1571676815

The only thing that matters is enriched uranium, which can be purchased from Russia or Pakistan. You clearly have no idea about basics of nuclear physics. It was hard to build nukes BEFORE people discovered our recent atomic models, now it is not. We know the theory, we know what we need, we know how to detonate it. It's not a well kept secret anyway. Once you acquired it, it's done. Israel has done it, and nobody could say anything. They are still not answering to anyone.

This is just the latest in a long line of incidents, but imagine that at one point when a logger was arrested his friends and family opened fire on a Gendarmerie vehicle to force his release, and it worked! So these idiots pretty much have no limits. 

National Parks and reservations are also being exploited, so there's no way that the authorities don't know about this. And they are complicit. Ask anyone who lives near the mountains and they'll all have some story for you regarding logging. I've heard of a Police officer who's car was set on fire as a warning message; he backed down, stopped asking questions and now drives a BMW. As stupid as it sounds, it might actually be true. 

Yes, the wrong people are just that powerful, but the locals sometimes support this. That's why there's no public outcry.

3749,"&gt; IDK in my opinion referendums rarely work

So true. We had a Ukraine referendum some years back, it was a yes or no vote to the Association Agreement between the European Union and Ukraine. Meaning trade. 

Obviously some parties hijacked that referendum to have stick to hit the EU with. They suggested the next step would be they would join, no they weren't and aren't. And loads of people went to vote against it to make a stance to the EU as whole. They didn't vote for the topic at hand at all. 



As you can see on [this map](https://i.imgur.com/uEM2xBM.png)

Lat year there was a vote in parliament to get rid of Referendums all together or set a minimum amount of voters to turn up. But that bill didn't pass. Otherwise it keeps on being the smaller majority with the loudest voices blocking things, unfortunately. And on very complex issues on top of it. 

I remember that in California I think people could (or still can) vote on loads of bills during elections, covering a wide variety of topics to give them a say in the process but that doesn't really work. One would for instance vote to lay down, in example, a very expensive new highway but at the same time vote to spend more money on schools or whatever, but when you look at the bigger picture, and the budget, that would simply be impossible to follow through.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/dkwdso/a_response_from_a_scottish_mum_about_the_brexit/f4kobjt/,nlx78,1571655298

3847,"Because they want to maintain the status quo.

They want Britain to keep its foot in the EU, single market, customs union, rebate, various opt outs, while being fundamentally opposed to ever closer union and increased integration.

They believe that we can keep this privileged position within the EU forever. It is an unreasonable and unfair position to take. All it does is ensures that eventually there will be a major clash between Britain and the rEU at some point in the future as the project inevitably has to integrate much more in order to become a proper union that is capable of dealing with the many problems facing Europe.

This clash would result in either Britain leaving anyways at some point in the future, or Britain being forced into ever closer union against its will. And in the run up to this clash there will be a constant feeling of ill will towards the UK, or hostility. 

This is why brexit, no matter the short term damage of it is the only option available that avoids major upheaval and problems in the future (and the damage is only short term, every economist and expert on planet earth agrees that medium to long term brexit will have no noticeable effect on either the UK or EU).

Now all of this is built on a single premise, that the UK public is fundamentally opposed to ever closer union, to a super state, a european federation, to the constant increase in integration. You can believe the British public would support this all you want, that is your right, but you would be wrong. It is abundantly clear the British public as an overwhelming majority do not support it, even remainers. All polling taken on key EU issues, Euro, schengen, common defence, common foreign policy, common fisheries, CAP, even budget contributions show a huge negative attitude towards it from the public. Take the Euro, the last significant nationwide poll taken on it was in 2012 and it showed only 6% support for adopting it.

How can you spin this sort of apathy and outright dislike as anything but total opposition to the EU?

My final point. None of this is me projecting my own beliefs into the population. It’s not me thinking everyone wants the same thing as me. I am a dual citizen who was born and raised  in a different EU nation, who moved to the UK for work and has never left. I am a EU federalist who wishes the EU does become a United States of Europe. I almost voted remain on referendum day and it was a very difficult vote for me. But I had to remove my own personal feelings from the matter and vote what was best for the UK and EU. And I explain above my reasons why. A remain win would have (to me) just been a delay in brexit, and it is an inevitable outcome that is going to happen within the next decade, so the sooner it happens the sooner both sides can adjust and work on building a new relationship.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/dkhty7/we_know_brexit_is_tiring_but_hundreds_of/f4ke12b/,ThunderousOrgasm,1571648127

He even attended church services. In reality, he could be considered as an Alevite or crypto-Christian which of course is a taboo for fundamentalists.

Over the years, provided that the most previleged populations and officials were Turks and Islamists the situation took its course.

On the other hand, more people were enforced to become Turks after Ataturk rather than in the days of the Ottoman empire. Ottoman empire fell easily because of its lack of consistency. And that's what Ataturk tried to solve with the genocides and then established a westernized regime. In 1900 Turks weren't numbered more than 3M, who weren't pure either. And the rest populations were somewhat equal in number. 
So, it is safe to say that Neo-Turks are 1/6 or less Turks. So, can you sustain a country with so many diversities following a western type of governance?

3909,"When Adnan's father sent him away from Syria's war, he had no idea that his son would swear allegiance to IS - in Ängelholm.
One night, the radicalized refugee armed himself with a knife and bomb attack and attacked a tavern in the Skåne city. He was arrested and sentenced to deportation. Two years later we meet him outside the same pub - he cannot be sent to Syria, is homeless but receives social assistance. ""I know how to convert extremists,"" he says.
October 22, 2017
That night, Adnan wants to be shot dead by a Swedish police. Die a so-called martyr death.  In his mobile phone he has over 3000 images of armed conflicts, dead and mutilated people, ongoing executions, acts of terrorism in Europe, propaganda and messages from the Islamic State.
In central Ängelholm panic erupts. Molotov cocktail-like bottles are thrown in, crushing the ""19th Century"" boxes. Outside, Adnan stands armed with a kitchen knife and a strange waist bag. Soon he is overpowered on the ground and looks apathetically straight ahead while the security guards hold him down. Then they see cables sticking out of his waist bag. ""Damn, call the police, this is bigger than we can handle,"" one of the guards yells. The National Bomb Guard and the police force of the police drive to the scene, ready to shoot Adnan if he moves while a bomb robot is slowly approaching to disarm him . Soon, the deed will turn into a mystery.
In the media, police quickly go out with information that the tavern has been attacked with juice bottles and an apparatus used to relieve back pain, rather than blast people.  The bomb belt proves to be a massage belt. In the end, Adnan is convicted of grossly unlawful threats, beatings, mischief, violations of the knife law and violent resistance to prison for one year and six months - and deportation.
October 2019
Two years later, Adnan is again outside the same pub. The 23-year-old is among the growing number of deported, radicalized men who cannot be deported. Adnan does not want to appear with a picture and his real name, as he is afraid that what he is telling will hit him if one day he is sent to Syria. We stand for a while and look out at the Rönne, who meanders through Ängelholm, when Adnan says he wants to work as a psychologist. He says his beliefs have changed, that he has worked with himself mentally to get out of radicalization, that he has been brainwashed and can now help others.
It is a strange situation. Just two years earlier, on October 30, 2017, Adnan has said he would like to commit the act to the nightclub again. And use violence or harm people in Sweden. Now he is back in Ängelholm, homeless and without job opportunities, and talks about a future that cannot be seen. 
Six months before the attack in Ängelholm, Sweden has been hit by a terror attack on Drottninggatan in Stockholm. Rakhmat Akilov then used a clear IS-inspired method when driving a stolen truck straight at people walking on a pedestrian street. It followed a trend of increased terrorist acts in Europe, where attacks in Nice, Berlin, London and Brussels attracted the most attention.
The Angel Council reminds of that kind of attacks, says a police officer at the resort in interrogation:
“I put together man, molotov, bomb belt, knife and larger crowd. I thought he might get people out of the restaurant with molotov cocktails and then act with the knife outside and then blow up the bomb. It could possibly have been a ""suicide by cop"" scenario as well .
The pub's Jim Nilsson, whose pub was attacked that night two years ago, does not want to meet Adnan. For him and his colleagues, the deed was aimed at the whole of Angelholm. He says that the pub life in the small town changed after the attack. “The damage is already done. I know he apologizes. But the nightlife in Angelholm is already hit. It is not the same as before the deed. People don't go out as much.”
The tavern employees are traumatized. They feel that society turned their backs when the deed is portrayed as a boy. “We had guests who got bottles in their heads. They had ice shards on them. People were hiding in the toilet”, says Elinor Koller, who worked on the 19th century about panic that night. 
In the preliminary investigation it appears that Adnan was close to being shot. What gave the response force for directives to the perpetrator?  The interrogator asks one of the police. ""That if he moved out, they would shoot for effect on him"" . What kind of picture do you have of the event? “What I think about are the events that have been happening in Europe. It is not thought that this can happen in Ängelholm. My picture is that the incident has terror-like features ”.
In Adnan's cellphone, the police find searches on how to make molotov cocktails. "" How to make a fire with a Corona beer bottle "". “ Homemade gasoline bombs too simple that you didn't expect ”. The bottles he used, sparkling wine bottles without alcohol, he bought at ICA.
May 2018
In the media debate, the attack, where no one is seriously injured, gets a shimmer of laughter over it. Contradictory opinions are expressed that the attack was not related to extremism, but that Adnan himself comes to speak. 
Until Expressen visits Adnan in the spring 2018 arrest. “I saw IS clips, life in the Islamic State. And I saw how other countries attack Muslims, women and children and old people. It made me feel bad.” says Adnan, who looks small and thin in the spring 2018 arrest.",Guernsey,/r/europe/comments/dkwjaa/after_the_terrorist_act_adnan_can_not_be_expelled/f4k90jo/,guernseyshore,1571640608

3919,"HISTORY OF ADNAN: SYRIA - MALAYSIA - ANGELHOLM
1996 Adnan is born in Damascus.
He grows up in a middle-class family.
During the summer holidays, the family vacation in Latakia and Tartus on the Mediterranean coast of Syria.
Adnan becomes proficient in English and dreams of working as an English teacher.
2011 The civil war in Syria starts.
2013 Adnan, who is now 17, and his 15-year-old brother, are sent to Malaysia to avoid being called into the Syrian army. Remaining in Syria are the parents and two younger siblings.
Malaysia allows Syrian citizens to enter the country without a visa. But they do not get a work permit.
Adnan works 14 hours a day for small money at various restaurants that utilize cheap labor.
2017
Adnan and his brother come to Sweden as quota refugees.
October 22, Adnan becomes radicalized in Sweden during the first half of the year, as he looks at pictures of the war in Syria and IS propaganda.
He is 21 when he attacks a tavern in Ängelholm, near the apartment where he lives, armed with kitchen knives, bottles similar to molotov cocktails and something reminiscent of a bomb belt.
 October 23 Adnan is released and the police soon announce that the bottles he attacked the tavern with contained juice and that the bomb belt was a massage belt.
Säpo takes over the investigation and Adnan is arrested again and taken to Malmö detention.
 November 14, a decision is made to expel Adnan.
2018
Adnan, who is still in custody during Säpo's detention, is now being detained by prosecutors for the Ängelholm Council suspected of unlawful threats, ill-treatment and mischief.
 On June 11, Säpo believes that Adnan ""is likely to commit or participate in terrorist offenses"".
June 16 in one Expressen article in the series ""Last night in Sweden"", Adnan acknowledges that he is an IS sympathizer.
September 27 Adnan was sentenced to one year and six months in prison and deportation.
 2019
One morning after the summer, Adnan is released from prison after serving a sentence.
He cannot be expelled because of the security situation in Syria, but he is also not allowed to work. According to the Migration Board, he has a duty to notify.
In Adnan's cellphone, the police find 3000 propaganda images and messages from the Islamic State. IS propaganda, which has been crucial to the terrorist group's survival, is aimed specifically at lonely men like Adnan. Here he finds an identity. “ During the Ramadan, I realized that I must begin to follow the hadiths (stories of Prophet Muhammad's words and deeds containing prohibitions and duties within Islam). I started reading a lot and checking out Youtube clips about IS. Slowly but surely I came to true Islam.” says Adnan in the spring 2018 arrest. “That's when I started to think that I who are in Europe should do something for the Muslims.”
When we first meet Adnan has been watching IS propaganda clips for six months. He has resigned from his job, because he does not stand out in a workplace where there are Muslims who do not live religiously. He is angry with the western world, has for months isolated himself and kept himself away from talking with different thinking. When the verdict falls after Säpo's preliminary investigation and the prosecution in Helsingborg district court, a counselor says that Adnan's purpose with the hook attack was to give the impression of a terrorist act. “In view of the man's actions and the circumstances in general, the people who have been in the vicinity have every reason to perceive the situation as an ongoing terrorist attack.” says councilor Linus Videgren in a press release .
Adnan goes past the bar first. Then he stands a bit away, at Stadsparken, and looks at the area where everything happened. He says that the glass windows on the tavern look different. Adnan has served his sentence but cannot be sent to Syria, as Sweden does not expel refugees to the war-affected country. During his detention, he has made a complete reversal. He says he realized how destructive IS's view of religion and people is. “When I attacked the tavern, I wanted to be shot by the Swedish police. After all, becoming a martyr was a goal. But I was brainwashed.”
Is the story of the Ängelholmsattacken the story of a failed terrorist attack? Perhaps it was just coincidence that the act ended in abuse - rather than a bloody act of terror. “No, says Adnan. I had the knife just to defend myself. I never wanted to hurt anyone but I wanted to get hurt.” The social services provide Adnan with financial support. But no one from the municipality has contacted him since he came out of prison several months ago. He has tried to reach the Relief Service, which promised to help him get hold of his life, but gets no answer.",Guernsey,/r/europe/comments/dkwjaa/after_the_terrorist_act_adnan_can_not_be_expelled/f4k92ep/,guernseyshore,1571640677
3920,"He is not allowed to work in Sweden when his residence permit was revoked when he was sentenced to deportation. He has no home of his own and often sleeps over with his brother or with a friend in Helsingborg. In the prison, he applied to study Swedish but was denied. He's standing here - but it's like nobody wants to see him. The only people who have visited Adnan since he was released are Säpo, who has met him on two occasions. One of the times after Adnan called them.
Adnan's situation is not unique. A 30-year-old Syrian man was released in 2017 from an attack on a Shiite party in Malmö, but was regarded by Säpo as a security risk. Yet, like Adnan, he could not be expelled to Syria. He was later arrested in Denmark where he was sentenced to 12 years in prison for planning to commit terror crimes in the country. On Friday , Ekot reported that the number of people who point to Säpo as a serious security threat according to the Special Aliens Control Act has increased significantly. 
Last spring, Säpo applied for the expulsion of six people, including several imams, who allegedly threatened the security of the kingdom. But, as in Adnan's case, the deportations are difficult to enforce. Recently, the Swedish Migration Agency informed Ekot that Sweden may soon begin to deport to certain parts of Syria, but this is considered unlikely by terrorist Magnus Ranstorp. “Of course, that is a dilemma. It is important to protect human rights, while at the same time the state must protect the lives and health of citizens, it also states in the Constitution.” “Perhaps this is the best solution, to keep these people close. The important thing is to activate them. He [Adnan] has been sitting and watching emotionally very strong material. He needs a quiet environment without radicals nearby.”
Adnan looks down at the ground and looks ashamed as he walks on the streets of Ängelholm. “Now I know how to reverse radicalized people, he says.” When he got out of prison, he was called by the mother to a friend who is about to be radicalized. She asked Adnan to talk to him. ""I used examples from the Qur'an to make him understand that Islam is not hate,"" he says. According to the Qur'an, God does not forbid to treat other believers with justice and impartiality. God loves the impartial.
An astonishing detail about Ängelholm is that Rakhmat Akilov, the Drottninggatan terrorist, in his search for targets had looked up the tour boat Laxen, which travels between Ängelholm city hall and the marina in Skälderviken. When Adnan attacked the tavern, he interacted with another radicalized Ängelholmsbo, who was deported from the city's mosque after the deed. Both he and Adnan had had disagreements with the other members. This led to Adnan one day offering the rest of the mosque at baklava, but still considered the others to interpret the Qur'an incorrectly. “Do you know what surprises me?” says Adnan now. “That no one who meets me asks how I thought when I attacked the tavern. It was a bizarre thing. In many ways, I find it difficult to understand how I thought.”
In the detention, Adnan recalled how his father sent him and his two-year younger brother to Malaysia, when they were only 17 and 15, respectively, to avoid being called into the Syrian army.In Malaysia, which does not require visas for Syrians, he worked long work passes for small money at restaurants owned by other immigrant Arabs. He was exploited. A few years later, in 2017, the brothers came to Sweden as quota refugees. “I understand that many people probably think that I do not deserve to stay in Sweden. And this report will surely make many angry. But I think I deserve a second chance.” says Adnan.",Guernsey,/r/europe/comments/dkwjaa/after_the_terrorist_act_adnan_can_not_be_expelled/f4k92ot/,guernseyshore,1571640688

3934,"When Adnan's father sent him away from Syria's war, he had no idea that his son would swear allegiance to IS - in Ängelholm.

One night, the radicalized refugee armed himself with a knife and bomb attack and attacked a tavern in the Skåne city. He was arrested and sentenced to deportation. Two years later we meet him outside the same pub - he cannot be sent to Syria, is homeless but receives social assistance. ""I know how to convert extremists,"" he says.

October 22, 2017

That night, Adnan wants to be shot dead by a Swedish police. Die a so-called martyr death.  In his mobile phone he has over 3000 images of armed conflicts, dead and mutilated people, ongoing executions, acts of terrorism in Europe, propaganda and messages from the Islamic State.

In central Ängelholm panic erupts. Molotov cocktail-like bottles are thrown in, crushing the ""19th Century"" boxes. Outside, Adnan stands armed with a kitchen knife and a strange waist bag. Soon he is overpowered on the ground and looks apathetically straight ahead while the security guards hold him down. Then they see cables sticking out of his waist bag. ""Damn, call the police, this is bigger than we can handle,"" one of the guards yells. The National Bomb Guard and the police force of the police drive to the scene, ready to shoot Adnan if he moves while a bomb robot is slowly approaching to disarm him . Soon, the deed will turn into a mystery.

In the media, police quickly go out with information that the tavern has been attacked with juice bottles and an apparatus used to relieve back pain, rather than blast people.  The bomb belt proves to be a massage belt. In the end, Adnan is convicted of grossly unlawful threats, beatings, mischief, violations of the knife law and violent resistance to prison for one year and six months - and deportation.

October 2019

Two years later, Adnan is again outside the same pub. The 23-year-old is among the growing number of deported, radicalized men who cannot be deported. Adnan does not want to appear with a picture and his real name, as he is afraid that what he is telling will hit him if one day he is sent to Syria. We stand for a while and look out at the Rönne, who meanders through Ängelholm, when Adnan says he wants to work as a psychologist. He says his beliefs have changed, that he has worked with himself mentally to get out of radicalization, that he has been brainwashed and can now help others.

It is a strange situation. Just two years earlier, on October 30, 2017, Adnan has said he would like to commit the act to the nightclub again. And use violence or harm people in Sweden. Now he is back in Ängelholm, homeless and without job opportunities, and talks about a future that cannot be seen. 

Six months before the attack in Ängelholm, Sweden has been hit by a terror attack on Drottninggatan in Stockholm. Rakhmat Akilov then used a clear IS-inspired method when driving a stolen truck straight at people walking on a pedestrian street. It followed a trend of increased terrorist acts in Europe, where attacks in Nice, Berlin, London and Brussels attracted the most attention.

The Angel Council reminds of that kind of attacks, says a police officer at the resort in interrogation:

“I put together man, molotov, bomb belt, knife and larger crowd. I thought he might get people out of the restaurant with molotov cocktails and then act with the knife outside and then blow up the bomb. It could possibly have been a ""suicide by cop"" scenario as well.

The pub's Jim Nilsson, whose pub was attacked that night two years ago, does not want to meet Adnan. For him and his colleagues, the deed was aimed at the whole of Angelholm. He says that the pub life in the small town changed after the attack. “The damage is already done. I know he apologizes. But the nightlife in Angelholm is already hit. It is not the same as before the deed. People don't go out as much.”

The tavern employees are traumatized. They feel that society turned their backs when the deed is portrayed as a boy. “We had guests who got bottles in their heads. They had ice shards on them. People were hiding in the toilet”, says Elinor Koller, who worked on the 19th century about panic that night. 

In the preliminary investigation it appears that Adnan was close to being shot. What gave the response force for directives to the perpetrator?  The interrogator asks one of the police. ""That if he moved out, they would shoot for effect on him"" . What kind of picture do you have of the event? “What I think about are the events that have been happening in Europe. It is not thought that this can happen in Ängelholm. My picture is that the incident has terror-like features”.

In Adnan's cellphone, the police find searches on how to make molotov cocktails. "" How to make a fire with a Corona beer bottle "". “ Homemade gasoline bombs too simple that you didn't expect ”.

3945,"HISTORY OF ADNAN: SYRIA - MALAYSIA – ANGELHOLM

1996 Adnan is born in Damascus.

He grows up in a middle-class family.

During the summer holidays, the family vacation in Latakia and Tartus on the Mediterranean coast of Syria.

Adnan becomes proficient in English and dreams of working as an English teacher.

2011 The civil war in Syria starts.

2013 Adnan, who is now 17, and his 15-year-old brother, are sent to Malaysia to avoid being called into the Syrian army. Remaining in Syria are the parents and two younger siblings.

Malaysia allows Syrian citizens to enter the country without a visa. But they do not get a work permit.

Adnan works 14 hours a day for small money at various restaurants that utilize cheap labor.

2017

Adnan and his brother come to Sweden as quota refugees.

October 22, Adnan becomes radicalized in Sweden during the first half of the year, as he looks at pictures of the war in Syria and IS propaganda.

He is 21 when he attacks a tavern in Ängelholm, near the apartment where he lives, armed with kitchen knives, bottles similar to molotov cocktails and something reminiscent of a bomb belt.

 October 23 Adnan is released and the police soon announce that the bottles he attacked the tavern with contained juice and that the bomb belt was a massage belt.

Säpo takes over the investigation and Adnan is arrested again and taken to Malmö detention.

 November 14, a decision is made to expel Adnan.

2018

Adnan, who is still in custody during Säpo's detention, is now being detained by prosecutors for the Ängelholm Council suspected of unlawful threats, ill-treatment and mischief.

 On June 11, Säpo believes that Adnan ""is likely to commit or participate in terrorist offenses"".

June 16 in one Expressen article in the series ""Last night in Sweden"", Adnan acknowledges that he is an IS sympathizer.

September 27 Adnan was sentenced to one year and six months in prison and deportation.

 2019

One morning after the summer, Adnan is released from prison after serving a sentence.

He cannot be expelled because of the security situation in Syria, but he is also not allowed to work. According to the Migration Board, he has a duty to notify.

In Adnan's cellphone, the police find 3000 propaganda images and messages from the Islamic State. IS propaganda, which has been crucial to the terrorist group's survival, is aimed specifically at lonely men like Adnan. Here he finds an identity. “ During the Ramadan, I realized that I must begin to follow the hadiths (stories of Prophet Muhammad's words and deeds containing prohibitions and duties within Islam). I started reading a lot and checking out Youtube clips about IS. Slowly but surely I came to true Islam.” says Adnan in the spring 2018 arrest. “That's when I started to think that I who are in Europe should do something for the Muslims.”

When we first meet Adnan has been watching IS propaganda clips for six months. He has resigned from his job, because he does not stand out in a workplace where there are Muslims who do not live religiously. He is angry with the western world, has for months isolated himself and kept himself away from talking with different thinking. When the verdict falls after Säpo's preliminary investigation and the prosecution in Helsingborg district court, a counselor says that Adnan's purpose with the hook attack was to give the impression of a terrorist act. “In view of the man's actions and the circumstances in general, the people who have been in the vicinity have every reason to perceive the situation as an ongoing terrorist attack.” says councilor Linus Videgren in a press release .

Adnan goes past the bar first. Then he stands a bit away, at Stadsparken, and looks at the area where everything happened. He says that the glass windows on the tavern look different. Adnan has served his sentence but cannot be sent to Syria, as Sweden does not expel refugees to the war-affected country. During his detention, he has made a complete reversal. He says he realized how destructive IS's view of religion and people is. “When I attacked the tavern, I wanted to be shot by the Swedish police. After all, becoming a martyr was a goal. But I was brainwashed.”

Is the story of the Ängelholmsattacken the story of a failed terrorist attack? Perhaps it was just coincidence that the act ended in abuse - rather than a bloody act of terror. “No, says Adnan. I had the knife just to defend myself. I never wanted to hurt anyone but I wanted to get hurt.” The social services provide Adnan with financial support. But no one from the municipality has contacted him since he came out of prison several months ago. He has tried to reach the Relief Service, which promised to help him get hold of his life, but gets no answer",Guernsey,/r/europe/comments/dkwjaa/after_the_terrorist_act_adnan_can_not_be_expelled/f4k98mj/,guernseyshore,1571640908

3947,"He is not allowed to work in Sweden when his residence permit was revoked when he was sentenced to deportation. He has no home of his own and often sleeps over with his brother or with a friend in Helsingborg. In the prison, he applied to study Swedish but was denied. He's standing here - but it's like nobody wants to see him. The only people who have visited Adnan since he was released are Säpo, who has met him on two occasions. One of the times after Adnan called them.

Adnan's situation is not unique. A 30-year-old Syrian man was released in 2017 from an attack on a Shiite party in Malmö, but was regarded by Säpo as a security risk. Yet, like Adnan, he could not be expelled to Syria. He was later arrested in Denmark where he was sentenced to 12 years in prison for planning to commit terror crimes in the country. On Friday , Ekot reported that the number of people who point to Säpo as a serious security threat according to the Special Aliens Control Act has increased significantly. 

Last spring, Säpo applied for the expulsion of six people, including several imams, who allegedly threatened the security of the kingdom. But, as in Adnan's case, the deportations are difficult to enforce. Recently, the Swedish Migration Agency informed Ekot that Sweden may soon begin to deport to certain parts of Syria, but this is considered unlikely by terrorist Magnus Ranstorp. “Of course, that is a dilemma. It is important to protect human rights, while at the same time the state must protect the lives and health of citizens, it also states in the Constitution.” “Perhaps this is the best solution, to keep these people close. The important thing is to activate them. He [Adnan] has been sitting and watching emotionally very strong material. He needs a quiet environment without radicals nearby.”

Adnan looks down at the ground and looks ashamed as he walks on the streets of Ängelholm. “Now I know how to reverse radicalized people, he says.” When he got out of prison, he was called by the mother to a friend who is about to be radicalized. She asked Adnan to talk to him. ""I used examples from the Qur'an to make him understand that Islam is not hate,"" he says. According to the Qur'an, God does not forbid to treat other believers with justice and impartiality. God loves the impartial.

An astonishing detail about Ängelholm is that Rakhmat Akilov, the Drottninggatan terrorist, in his search for targets had looked up the tour boat Laxen, which travels between Ängelholm city hall and the marina in Skälderviken. When Adnan attacked the tavern, he interacted with another radicalized Ängelholmsbo, who was deported from the city's mosque after the deed. Both he and Adnan had had disagreements with the other members. This led to Adnan one day offering the rest of the mosque at baklava, but still considered the others to interpret the Qur'an incorrectly. “Do you know what surprises me?” says Adnan now. “That no one who meets me asks how I thought when I attacked the tavern. It was a bizarre thing. In many ways, I find it difficult to understand how I thought.”

In the detention, Adnan recalled how his father sent him and his two-year younger brother to Malaysia, when they were only 17 and 15, respectively, to avoid being called into the Syrian army.In Malaysia, which does not require visas for Syrians, he worked long work passes for small money at restaurants owned by other immigrant Arabs. He was exploited. A few years later, in 2017, the brothers came to Sweden as quota refugees. “I understand that many people probably think that I do not deserve to stay in Sweden. And this report will surely make many angry. But I think I deserve a second chance.” says Adnan.",Guernsey,/r/europe/comments/dkwjaa/after_the_terrorist_act_adnan_can_not_be_expelled/f4k997h/,guernseyshore,1571640929

3956,"We're seeing this across all developed countries. There is a huge rift between the population. There is nearly the same amount on both sides, which makes it even worse.

One part is pro euro/world/integration/socialism and the other one is pro nationalism/separatism/conservatism/capitalism.

As noticed, I've specifically chosen those words. Not all conservatives are racists, but nearly all have some kind of fear or prejudice against other races, religions or even countries. These people, based on their believes, fear that they cannot keep up with the changing world and thus want it to stay the way (they perceive) has been in the past.

On the other side you have people open to change and accepting that the world needs them to always be adapting to new circumstances.

So you have people striving for change and people fearing change. This creates a huge imbalance. And it is understandable.
The people that fear change are made up of mainly 2 types.
1. Entrepreneurs that are in markets that might get obsolete once the change happens. So their very livelihood is threatened. 
2. People that lack the skills to adapt to the coming changes.

Neither of those two people are dumb, ignorant or whatever. They're drive by fear, because they simply do not know how to handle this new world. And this fear unloads itself in all kind of manners: Nationalism (looking for a safe haven), Conservatism (getting back to old values, that are familiar), overly religious (seeking protection in faith), Xenophobia (protecting themselves from those that they perceive are bringing in the change) and worst of all the blind obedience to those that promise all this things (fascists, autocrats, dictators, and so on).

On the other hand you have those that openly accept all races, markets, changes and so on. Actively seeking this situations, because their skill allow them to thrive under this circumstances. Since they do not understand how it could be not to be able to thrive here, they are unable and sometimes unwilling to reach out to those in fear. Commending them at old fashioned, racist, dumb or whatever.

And what makes things worse, is that the distribution of population, access and quality of education and jobs (wealth) across all the countries and sometimes even within region creates havens for both of these sides. Just look at all the data world wide how big city hubs (see Hong Kong) are filled with those who are ""social"", ""democratic"", ""educated"" and all the rural areas are filled with those who are ""racist"", ""conservative"", ""totalitarian"" and so on.

Because of the way we built this world, since before the ancient Romans and ancient Egypts, we created an unbalance in education, security, wealth and access to basically everything. Those in the hubs thrive because of competition, innovation, access to knowledge and other cultures (world views) and those in rural areas need much longer to reach these new states of existence.

What happens is what you see now.
70-50 years ago there where uniform people across the world. Because of the last great war, a lot of industrial countries lost a huge amount of population and rebuilding their countries and the wish for peace created an uniform kind of people. Same values, same goals, same beliefs. No matter if French-Christian, Turkish-Muslim or German-Atheist.
But when we reach the 60/70s, we started to thrift apart. First between countries, than in the 80/90s within all Countries itself.

Now you don't only have an imbalance between countries, but within those countries itself.
This pared with the reality that the mistakes of the past are now coming back to us (political, economical and ecological exploitation of poorer countries), the imbalance is about to explode:

- Rise of Muslim terrorism
- Rise of right wing terrorism
- Rise of nationalism
- Rise of fascism
- Rise of anti-west sentiment in the middle east, asia and south america
- Rise of anti everything in the west (really: People hate everything openly now from Starbucks to the name Ali, it's ridiculous) 

And now were having the first explosions:
- Americans that were so shocked after having a black president and the fear of having a female president literally making them voting for the WORST possible candidate. (I strongly believe that none other would have been worst, not even if they voted for the Italian Mafia)
- Several European countries haven separation talks (Spain) or actually voting to leave Europe out of frustration and than regretting it (Britain)
- Several European countries electing, supporting and cheering up obviously anti-people-dictator-like figures (Poland, Italy, Greece, already tried their luck and most of the other countries didn't get there yet).
- The internet cheering for Hong Kong while being absolutely unmoved by all the the problems they have in their own countries (not all users, but probably most of them)

TL;DR: Geographical, economical, educational problems we've started to create 40-50 years ago are now coming back to bite us in our butt and I hope we can postpone the war to come as long as possible, because I don't want my son to die in a stupid war, just because people are to stupid to try to view life from other peoples point of view.
