5,"Don't get me wrong, I agree that many Brits are not like that. And I agree that it is probably more the old people, as I mentioned in the comment. I have lived my entire life in the southern coast of Spain and I have seen many of these neighborhoods and closed communities. Other retirees, integrate, but not British retirees. So my only personal experience is that.

I, on the other hand, have plenty of British friends, who are themselves appalled and ashamed by that type of behaviour, so I totally understand that not all Brits are like that. I feel them, because that happens to me too (for example, when I hear someone from Vox talking, I just ramp up my German accent).

10,"You don't need to think the same of all Europeans either.  
Beggars for instance are likely seen as more of an issue than skilled labour immigrants even if both come from an EU country.  


It's not racism to not want to share your country, democracy, wealth, rule and replace your people with them and sacrifice your freedom and safety.  


As for the true meaning of the word I'd argue it would be racist to view them as inferior. However even if someone has such a view I'd argue it would just be labeling having that opinion and wouldn't be a counter argument. Their opinion / their reasons for thinking so may be correct. And that's what you should have to deal with rather than just labeling their opinion and try to shut them down like that. Personally I don't view some sort of tribal life in wooden halls in the jungle with no technological progress as less human. I do however recognize how that life style and their knowledge at-least of things we find important and very much so relative what our communal knowledge is together is far inferior. I do recognize people from Africa typically have a lower education level and come from more corrupt societies and more things but I won't go into details due to the rules of the group. The point is that people who see differences may very well be completely correct. For some reason it's viewed as wrong to recognize that but if it's correct it's not wrong.

34,"You say that like it actually mean anything.  


Immigrants may come and just live of welfare benefits, that's bad.  
Immigrants may come and possibly out-compete you for a job, you may also view that as bad.  


I'd argue the former is always bad whereas in the later case if you get cheap labour and access to cheaper services and possibly goods that could be good for you as well as if they are specialists and your society reach further and you get better goods and services that too could be good. So I'm not sure whatever the work-force immigrants is good or bad but if you actually lose your job from it and earn less then I can totally see how you don't like it. It's fine. And it's not racism. It's egoism. And egoism may be good for you.  


I'd agree more on that it's xenophobia, though I don't really agree on the phobia part either. But then I feel at-least the correct word and meaning are used. But so what? It's ok to want to preserve your people and community and to not provide your communities rights and privileges to everyone else or have them come and decide how you should live. I feel like even those who don't accept that in Europe may actually think that's perfectly fine for people in Africa. Like was colonialism good? Was Belgian Kongo good? Considering Africa is 7 times the size of the EU but only have 2 times the population and how supposedly the land, wealth and rights of EU belongs to anyone would you also say natural resources in an African country do too? Oil wealth in the middle-east? If not why not? Lots of such people are also pro Palestine possibly against Israel, seem like a bunch of Jewish people is against a one state solution there too. But if it's always good and there's no them and us then why would you be against a larger Israel including the Palestines making Israel a Arab majority country? What's wrong with that if nationalism is bad an multiculturalism and mixing is good?  


I'd argue it's not good. I however accept the idea that if the society is already mixed for the minorities it's of course better if they are tolerated by the majority.",,/r/europe/comments/dg2uom/shit_just_got_serious_for_english_people/f3a7cix/,aliquise,1570763601

Operating profit itself doesn't say much if you don't look at the risks, functions and revenue generated by each company. In the case of twitter, once the product is generated the actual cost of running the business it's extremely low compared to the revenure it can generate, a handfull of people should be capable of producing huge revenues, as some other tech / software company does and therefore a much higher operating profit is possible. So tax authorities shouldn't really look at operating profit in this case, as it is a ridiculous statistic to look at for the sector / business model.

It's difficult to believe that a company with a global revenue of 2.6 billion produced less than 50 in Spain, which should be one of their top 10 markets.

While a lot of change is nice, having a lot of change if you have previously been absolutely wasteful is fairly easy. The more CO2 you are already saving, the harder it becomes to save even more (and the more costly).

While a wasteful society will look better than the rest for ""saving more"" just because they became slightly less wasteful.

For example: one guy constantly has a running heater and to make it colder he doesn't turn off the heater: he just turns on the AC on top of it. Another guy just turns off the heater and opens a window.

Now the first guy adopts the second guy's strategy and saves maybe half of his previous energy use. And it didn't cost hm a cent of personal investment. The second guy will have to improve his home insulation or install more efficient devices. Either of these things are very costly and won't suddenly drop his CO2 use in half. On paper guy 2 will look like he did less than guy 1 did.

298,"WARSAW—Elections in Poland and Hungary on Sunday will provide a test of the continued appeal of two European governments that have been a standard-bearer for conservative, nationalist movements across the region.

In both contests—parliamentary elections in Poland and municipal ballots in Hungary—opposition groups hope to dent the popularity of nationalist governments that have won broad public support with a mix of socially conservative policies and benefits for child-rearing families.

In Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s Fidesz party risks losing control of the capital of Budapest to a candidate with the backing of several ideologically diverse parties. Such an outcome would afford his opponents their first significant base in a country where Mr. Orban’s party has been in power for nine years and controls two-thirds of parliament.

In legislative elections in Poland, polls show the ruling Law and Justice party having nearly double the support of its nearest competitor, but the party could nevertheless lose its parliamentary majority.

That would offer opposition parties—a mix of social conservatives, socialists and liberals—the chance to form a government. In response, Law and Justice has doubled down on its longstanding positions opposing gay rights and has rolled out fresh policies aimed at luring working class and Catholic conservative voters.

Opposition parties in both countries have argued during the campaign that the ruling parties in Hungary and Poland have led the countries into a form of soft authoritarianism.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS

How do you think a second term of Law and Justice will affect Poland? Join the conversation below.

“It will be mainly the results from this election that tells us to what extent our country has been destroyed,” said Lech Walesa, the Nobel Peace Prize winning leader of Poland’s 1980s anticommunist movement, now a protest figure against the ruling party. “I am telling the world... see what is going on in Poland. Such a brave nation has ignored democracy and is in trouble now.”

At stake is whether voters will breathe fresh life into a kind of nationalism that has seen mixed fortunes of late. A series of recent defeats by nativist parties in Western Europe suggests those forces may have plateaued after a period of strong growth, though momentum could always swing back to them.

In Austria, the Freedom Party, which had been part of the ruling coalition, lost nearly half its seats in last month’s parliamentary election and is now in opposition.

In Italy, Matteo Salvini’s League party failed this summer in its attempt to trigger elections and consolidate recent gains in popularity for his anti-immigration party. After enjoying a dominant role in Italy’s governing coalition for more than a year, Mr. Salvini is now relegated to the opposition.

By contrast, Poland and Hungary have been Europe’s dual case studies for how nationalist governments, skeptical of liberal democratic ideals, can perform in office. In each, ruling parties have won legislative majorities big enough to enact major policy changes. Both governments have used their power to pass swift economic reforms, but also weaken constitutional checks-and-balances in ways their critics see as authoritarian.

“We are the only two countries where one party can form a government. No need for stupid debates,” said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto in a recent interview. “There’s room and opportunity for quick and effective decisions.”

During its four-year term, Law and Justice has restocked courts and state-owned media with loyalists, sparking clashes with the European Union and accusations at home that one of Europe’s largest nations is backsliding from democracy.

If the opposition won, it would “strive for a radical destruction of the moral and cultural order of our country with all devastating consequences for our future,“ said the party’s leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski in a recent speech. “We want Poland to last. It is important to be Polish.”

In Hungary, Mr. Orban has created what critics see as a playbook for cementing single party control over a sizable state. 

Business people friendly with Mr. Orban have bought up hundreds of small and large media outlets, giving the ruling party a near-monopoly on what messages reach Hungarian TV and radio audiences. Independent media outlets have closed, saying their private advertisers were afraid of being tax audited if they continued purchasing ads. 

The ruling party has redrawn voting districts to its benefit, and purged courts. The opposition says it struggles to purchase basic services, like flyer printing, from Hungarian companies afraid of political pressure.

If Law and Justice falls short on Saturday, Polish opposition parties have pledged to undo government policies they consider autocratic.

Law and Justice has sought to shore up its base with policies and promises on both pocketbook issues and hot-button cultural questions. It has instituted monthly welfare payments to families with school-age children and has lowered the retirement age. It promises to double the minimum wage.

Meanwhile, the party has declared dozens of small cities “LGBT Free” and has pushed to restrict access to abortion. Such policies have endeared it to the Polish Catholic church, a powerful force in the country, and to Poles who feel that their membership in the EU brings laudable economic benefits but also cultural pressures to accept Western, secular ideals.
Rival parties have united behind Gergely Karacsony, a former university professor, as mayor of Budapest. Photo: attila kisbenedek/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images

Indeed, on a recent morning, a national map hanging on the wall of Law and Justice’s Warsaw headquarters broke down the country not by voting district but by Catholic diocese.

“Will we follow the path of the left-liberal revolution as most of Western Europe?” said the party’s deputy spokesman Radoslaw Fogiel. “Or will we stick to our lifestyles and traditions?”

In Budapest, Mr. Orban’s candidate faces a tight re-election against an opposition campaign entitled “Let’s Take Back Budapest.” Multiple corruption scandals and growing grievances against Mr. Orban’s style of leadership have encouraged rival parties to coalesce behind Gergely Karacsony, a former university professor running for mayor.

“A mayor from the opposition would be such a force of society,” Mr. Karacsony said. “Looking at Central and Eastern Europe, and Turkey, you can see that the social opposition to these right-wing, populist regimes is coming from big cities.”",,/r/europe/comments/dg6dyl/europes_nationalist_movements_face_tests_in/f39kn84/,VerneJu,1570749969

300,"&gt;  All the more reasons for Europe to want to influence in what happens in Syria then by having a presence there.  

It's not about presence itself. Europe is a gas/oil importer, so it needs to stabilize gas/oil prices. That's what US was doing in ME since early 80's (before early 80's US presence was about importing oil from ME). US has no longer that interest in ME since 2017, but we know that would happen since about 2012 at least. US is one of the major oil/shale producers and an important exporter.

The second reason for Europe is stabilizing the region politically, not in the context of oil prices, but in the context of migrations and importing political instability.

Third reason is check-balancing Turkey which has the biggest potential of dominating the region after US leaves and that's a threat of limiting EU control over Balkans in further future. That's not a direct threat now although Turkey has a growing influence in Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo, Northern Macedonia and lately - Serbia. EU needs to stop that process but in this context there is time.

 Europe has actually more reasons to be in ME than US ever had.

&gt;  you made the claim that Syria poses an existential threat to the EU 

No I have not. The instability of the region is an existential threat to the EU.

&gt;  If we assume this to be true then EU leaders should be mobilizing appropriate forces to face that existential threat instead of just throwi[...]

No, because they can't for reasons already mentioned in post before.

&gt;  One way or another the result would be firing upon long term allies who are also major trade partners. 

Someone would have to agree on that. Turkey's actions have not been met with general condemn of EU states. As I said, EU is decision-making  impotent most of the time, also in this case. That's the root of your error. You can't understand, that they should do something, but they're not able to do so. That's also why EU hasn't manage to transform itself into a hard-power organization with a real army. Something that could actually respond to these upcoming troubles. That's the main cause. 

A threat -&gt; A real army is needed to do something -&gt; EU has no real army -&gt; EU member states alone are too small and not cooperating enough when it comes to military because their armies (except France) are built to complement US forces -&gt; Everybody knows Sultan isn't afraid of EU states alone -&gt; There is no real response -&gt; EU is going to take a hit. I hope it's clear now.

If you use your ability to read, I said 5% of batteries in the EU, not of car batteries. It can, however, be misunderstood in that phrase, but it doesn't excuse your lack of education.   
Regarding car battery recycling, model S was launched ~7/8y ago, and Tesla's growth in production is more recent, which means right now the batteries being recycled are in a rather small number compared to the ones in 10y, and many of the partially depleted ones of today are being reused as energy storage units. [Hopefully there is light at the end of the tunnel, since Tesla and other companies are claiming to have developed efficient lithium battery recycling processes.](https://electrek.co/2019/04/16/tesla-battery-recycling-system/). All of this brings, in my opinion, severe limitations when electric cars in the millions reach their battery limits, and its polution future will depend on the effective development of recycling tech.   

You are right regarding the existence of electric mining trucks, I didn't know about them. They have limitations though. The one you posted, is usable if the cargo is higher than the dropping point, thus regenerating electricity. [If it is lower, good luck charging 700kwh (~10h). It suits specific mine topography.](https://insideevs.com/news/362547/edumper-8-ton-battery-pack/). Also, it is a dumper truck, which is loaded with other kinds of fossil fuel machinery, and other brands that produce these in as electric powered, have operating charge limitations. But it is a good initiative that I didn't know existed.  
Regarding ships, it is arguable that cargo ship emissions are that small, when total ship transportation emissions account for [~2,5% of global CO2 emissions](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/shipping_en).

For a mid-sized country that needs to import military technology it's just not possible. The EU should be on the right side of history. Americans know how to make war but not peace. Europe cannot undo everything the US has done in the ME. It would have been the duty of the US president to make sure the Kurds can live in peace before pulling out. There are many scenarios such as making the YPG fighters pull back from the border in exchange for Turkey not invading, which could have avoided this. At this stage, Trump has given away any leverage he had with the Kurds and the Turks to win the next election. Europe cannot remedy this mess, over which it had no say, in the first place. At this stage, all the EU can do is to lean on Turkey by economic means to avoid a blood bath and even more refugees. The EU should not be in the business of regime change, but actions have consequences, even for the Caliph. He is cranking up his ratings by feeding into jingoistic sentiments at home, but once the body bags come home and the economy starts to tank, Turks will have second thoughts.

507,"&gt;	Not the sole ones though which make like to think. And yes, our side too had it’s propaganda, but so did each warring side here, which is to be expected since all were directly involved in the war. You’d expect neutrality from an outsider, but nope, geopolitics of course have to come first.

for Serbia the Croats were the Ustaša, the Bosniaks were the Mujahideen, the Albanians were KLA terrorists (or Mujihadeen too).
Using genocidal paramilitaries like the Scorpions in every conflict from Croatia to Kosovo etc. is something crazy.

&gt;	I’d say both are close to being equally bad, because both are pretty much denying war crimes and putting all blame on one side. The people I meant are the ones that pretend we didn’t suffer at all and everything was our fault, they’re not much better than Handke.

Who is denying Bosnian/Albanian war crimes?

&gt;	And let’s face it, in regards to Srebrenica, saying it wasn’t genocide but only ethnic cleansing is a perfectly valid position. I believe quite a few genocide scholars hold the same view, cause of the key detail of thousands of women and children being spared and sent to Bosniak held territory. If the goal is genocide you kill all of them, you don’t spare so many. And genocide mainly hinges on intent. I don’t think anyone genocide anyone in the 90s here, we just ethnically cleansed each other to varying degrees. If you disagree, that’s fair.

** Wait what - are you denying the genocide? Denying the genocide is Serbian/R. Srpska propaganda, again. Literally everyone except Serbia/Russia does so.** 
The ICTY, ICJ, EU, US (yes, the US isn’t better either) all declared it as a genocide, but not the UN because of the Russian veto **at the request of Serbia/R.Srpska**.

578,"The representation of Spain in NATO reaffirmed the presence of the gunners of the Army, coinciding with the announcement that Trump withdraws his troops from northern Syria

“The Turkish Army Support Unit of the Earth Army works 24/7 to protect Adana and shows the commitment and solidarity with our ally Turkey”: with this message, accompanied by a video, and another similar tweet, the Permanent Representation of Spain NATO reacted on Monday October 7 to the news that these days affect the Asian country.

It all started with Donald Trump's decision to retract US troops that are at bases and observation posts on the Turkish-Syrian border.

That opened the door for the Turkish army to start an offensive against Kurdish militias operating in northern Syria on Wednesday.

In that context, the two tweets of the Spanish embassy to NATO were published in which the commitment of our country to the defense of Turkey, a member of the Atlantic Alliance, was reaffirmed.

For years a contingent of the Spanish Air Force Antiaircraft Artillery Command has been located at the Incirlik air base in Adana province (near the border with Syria) to protect the Turkish territory with a Patriot missile battery.

Well, as Confidencial Digital could see, those tweets provoked a genuine wave of messages of thanks from Turks who celebrated Spain's commitment to the defense of Turkey.
Flags, Catalonia and Real Madrid

Flags of Spain with Turkish teachings, “Long live Spain” messages, “Good [sic] afternoons Spain, Ola. I love you very much ”,“ Today we tomorrow you, the right decision Spain ”,“ Thank you Spain ”,“ Long live the friendship Turkey-Spain ”,“ **Our best friend in Europe and my second homeland from now on. Thanks Spain!** ”...

But more striking were the response messages to those tweets from the Permanent Representation of Spain in NATO that made reference to Catalan independence, perhaps by analogy with the Kurdish independents: ""**Down with the divisive Catalans**"", ""**Down with the Catalans**"", ""**No bread or water for the Catalans** "","" **Long live Spain! Down with Catalonia!** "","" Long live the totally independent Spain. **Puta Cataluña** ”,“ **Thank you, fuck Catalonia** ”...

In addition to these slogans, from insults to the Catalans, other Turks directly place the PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party) with the Catalan independence workers and call for “**permanent solidarity” between Spain and Turkey against the “separatist terrorism**” .

Faced with these more political messages, other Turks decided to thank by writing football references: Hala Madrid, Real Madrid, Deportivo de La Coruña, Messi ... Sergio Ramos is one of the most repeated in the answers given by Turkish Twitter users.

It should be noted that the publications on Twitter of the Permanent Representation of Spain in NATO (@SpainNATO) **hardly have interactions**: a couple of retweets and favorites, no response ...

However, the first of the tweets about support for the deployment of Spain in Turkey had this Wednesday, October 9, **more than 890 retweets and 5,700 likes, in addition to almost 400 responses**.

The second tweet was even more successful: more than 800 replies, 2,100 retweets and 9,600 likes.",Catalan Republic,/r/europe/comments/dg10x1/the_deployment_of_spanish_patriot_missiles_in/f37l029/,Toc_a_Somaten,1570727172

That is a somewhat common feature among certain types of British residents in Spain too. They usually get offended when called immigrants and only like the term expat. It all comes from the idea that they are making us a favour for living in Spain, that they are giving us free money and teaching us a superior culture. Terms like ""golden cows"" are constantly thrown around as a justification for that type of behaviour, especially among older immigrants.

Is there enough reasonable doubt? Depends on how the deletion is requested.

Those things can be turned back. A deletion is forever and can lead to people losing money. Imagine someone gaining access to your email and next day your account with products worth a few hundred euros is gone. A password change can be undone and they can give you your access back, a deletion is forever.

I don't think we're good culturally at all. We're like worms in the corpse of something that once used to be alive, just sucking out the last juices we can. Or to use a less morbid analysis we're riding off the momentum of the 18th and 19th centuries with little serious cultural development since.

So weak is our present culture in Europe that we're having problems stopping people joining Islamic extremists - it's literally more appealing to a chunk of our society to go around beheading like savages than what we offer, because we offer virtually nothing now.

Postmodernity has led to this continent becoming a cultural vacuum, even to conceptualise ""European culture"" as a thing to be desired or celebrated  is to be critiqued and viewed with suspicion. To want a culture is to make a statement of superiority over another - this is fundamentally incompatible with the multicultural ideology we've sleep-walked into in (Western) Europe.

We're mostly a continent in retirement, a museum, a husk from the violence of the 20th century - use whatever analogy or framework you like - 21st century Europe is incredibly culturally gloomy in my view.

and

&gt; As part of Budget 2020, the Department of Finance published a report which warned that a major “shock” to Ireland’s corporation tax base could leave a **€6 billion** hole in the public finances.


Based on [this article](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/corporation-tax-shock-could-leave-6bn-hole-in-public-finances-1.4044417), it looks like the Republic of Ireland's Department of Finance produced several different scenarios.  Some involve €1 billion, and some involve €6 billion:

&gt;The first and worst-case scenario involves corporation tax receipts reverting to 2014 levels over the course of two years, beginning in 2020. This could result in a permanent budgetary gap of €6 billion by 2021 relative to current expectations.

The autopilot is not the only system used on board modern ships.

I would trust these to keep position in a tight situation - and they're automated. But thru require a human backup in case the system fails. They're predominantly used in the offshore energy segment - but I hear other types are starting to use it too.

I think that people who believe something that goes against the official stance of the government, like the idiots who are trying to lie about the motives of the attack, should be allowed to protest and voice their opinion. Since I don't believe that we should silence those people for being brain damaged, I think the best course of action is to very clearly make a statement that the majority of the French people agree with the government opinion of the motives of the attack, and imo you show this by holding a protest much bigger than theirs, as oppose to just shutting down their protest.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the NAZI's, I couldn't care less, in a free country NAZI's are allowed to exist, and shutting down any sort of organisation they partake in makes no sense : NAZI'S vote, so should we get rid of the vote ? I disagree that opinions are ""not valid to have"", because in that scenario you always give too much power to the people that get to decide what is valid, and therefore take freedom away from those that don't. And again, a country which gives the government the power to shut down protests that have ""unsavory"" motives cannot claim to be free, and sadly I am pretty sure that is the state of my country today.

Article 37. – Prohibition of perfidy

&gt;1. It is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy. Acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy. The following acts are examples of perfidy:

&gt;(a) The feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender;
(b) The feigning of an incapacitation by wounds or sickness;
(c) The feigning of civilian, non-combatant status; and
(d) The feigning of protected status by the use of signs, emblems or uniforms of the United Nations or of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict.

**&gt;2. Ruses of war are not prohibited. Such ruses are acts which are intended to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly but which infringe no rule of international law applicable in armed conflict and which are not perfidious because they do not invite the confidence of an adversary with respect to protection under that law. The following are examples of such ruses: the use of camouflage, decoys, mock operations and misinformation.**

Arbitrary might be possible but according to the standards established with other airline shoot downs the case would be fairly weak. The Ukrainians were conducting airborne supply missions at the time and had lost several transports including a four engine il-76 in the conflict already.

While I will admit there definitely are perks to being born in the 21st century (depending on your definition, I'm going by 0AD/BC = real, 2000 = 21st century definition) there are things lost to time that won't be the same again even if brought back. Plus I always had an affinity for old vehicles, architecture, etc, probably helped in large part to me growing on Thomas and Friends Seasons 1 through 4, given the premise (talking steam trains, presumably set around dieselization beginning based on how few diesels are seen). 

So while I do miss the olden days, it's not the level where I'd bring the past to me like some other people. Though I would, if given the means to (without repercussions in biology), time travel back and take a more in depth look at things we don't have today.

List of things I'd see:
1. Big Bertha 0-10-0 banking the Lickey Incline.
2. Flying Scotsman hitting 100 mph for the first time.
3. RMS Olympic arriving in New York Harbor.
4. 1938 20th Century Limited pulled by a Streamlined J3a Hudson (possibly getting a ticket to ride).
5. My great grandpa before he died when I was 3 and a half.
6. The original airing for the Daleks Master Plan.
7. Boo Mallard going 126 mph since it cheated so hard.
8. Cheer 05.002 for legitimately going 124.5 mph
9. See Titanic leave port.
10. Go to Armagh on June 12th, 1889.

This is especially telling, because it makes sense. It's not that embarrassing on the international stage for a power if one of their internal divisions vetoes some national matter. But when it comes to international relations, such divisions do not only make you weak, they are dangerous as they can paralyze or cripple you in dealing with other powers and they present a attack point that hostile powers can exploit either covertly or try to pry wide open in public to sow internal division.

I'm pretty sure that that's not what the rules say.  I'd think that as long as the potatoes were legal *at the time that they were imported* that they'd continue to be legal.  I mean, potatoes have a short shelf life -- I am *sure* that there is huge amounts of stuff that was imported and hasn't yet been sold, and there's no way that all that merchandise is going to be discarded.

Honestly, if we're gonna approach this as Europeans with a sober view of realpolitik, NATO breaking apart would most likely be beneficial if the reaction to it is handled well.

The US empire is showing cracks. It's looking more and more like they're going to lose the middle east to Iranian and Chinese interests. Considering the US is also staggering economically and politically, pax Americana is definitively coming to a close.

It doesn't help that the massive economic inequality and uncertainty of the american economy is killing the legitimacy of liberal-democratic institutions. That's been a death knell for liberal capitalist states since the concept came into being.

If Europe can ward off our own growing destabilization, stop acting as American client states (vital to warding off the death of our own insitutions, most effectively through a reinstatement of Keynesian economics and social democracies), and finally start acting like we've got some common interests, we could likely survive another shift in global power.",,/r/europe/comments/dfijw8/nato_general_secretary_stoltenberg_turkey_has/f34vfiy/,Culexus_assassin,1570661665

I am not a corbynite (I wouldnt choose him for PM if i was choosing from even labour MPs, Keir or Ed all the way!). But he isnt as bad as people seem to think - the media is definitely aggressively biased against him

And because of that we would be far better with a different labour leader from a PR point of view (how I wish it had gone Corbyn then Ed Milliband)

Hell, at the dispatch box since Johnson came to power Corbyn has looked statesman like especially compared to the tory leader.

But also, from a media point of view, replacing him at this point would just cause more problems. Itll be either ""Labour coup"" if they remove him. Or ""Labour leader cant hack it"" which will be painted as ""labour are weak"" if he stands down.

And if there is a Labour leadership election it will be ""labour infighting"", if there isn't it will be ""undemocratic labour""
 
They should have replaced him about a year ago ideally, and would love them to do so if they can do it quietly without the media storm - he would need to be involved though... maybe he could fake his death?

1725,"Lots to reply to here, so I’ll try and keep it concise. Also I’m replying over the phone so I won’t be able to highlight the paragraphs in question.

To the first point you raise, that you need high HDI/GDP to attract immigrants, who support a higher fertility rate. Well that’s fair, but pro-family policies aren’t anti-growth. In fact they’re an important source of both economic stimulus, as well as rebalancing of tax revenues. Poland’s program, the 500+ for example, cut child poverty by 75%, increasing HDI. It also acts as a subsidy for poorer people, and is funded primarily through the VAT tax, a tax harvested through consumption. Since the more wealthy consume more, logically it serves as a transfer from them to the lower classes, reducing inequality. In addition, Poland has attracted millions of immigrants (primarily Ukrainians). So it’s not like they’re pulling a Japan and closing their society off while trying to raise TFR.

You use Poland and Hungary as bad examples of money invested into pro-fertility policies, but you’re wrong. For one, these programs are only a few years old, and it’s too early to judge the results. But there has been a slight uptick in both countries. Second, both of their finances are quite stable. In both countries their debt-to-gdp ration has been declining, at 70% in Hungary and 48% in Poland. They both run slight fiscal deficits, but well within the Maastricht treaty rules. On top of all these, there are real, tangible benefits people get from these incentives. In Hungary, it allows people to buy/build homes and establish a family while in Poland as I’ve said before it’s cut child poverty rates by 75%. Even if fertility stays flat (which it won’t, it has already started to tick up in both countries) these are admirable social policies. 

I get what you’re saying about immigrants to the US. Traditionally, they’ve probably been more likely to be the “go-getters”, the mobile and adventurous types. But that sort of thinking is very “eugenic”, how do I put it, and I don’t think it fairly explains the difference in situation between Europe and the US. Institutions matter, as well as the way they set up their economy. But again, their innovation comes from youth, and from the fact they get to select the best and brightest, while we don’t. Not to diss on the immigrants that come here, many are hard working and good people, but the quality is just different. High skill, wealthy and educated migrants go to the US, due to many factors. Economy, good schools, society open to newcomers, etc, things we can’t compete with them on. 

And I’m going to pick a bone with you here. In your previous comments you say we don’t need to worry about maintaining our population because we won’t have need for low skilled people, yet you talk about how low skilled migrants are necessary to do jobs that are hard to automate? So which is it then? Is the total availability of manpower important or not? Also, we have countries like Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal, places with double digit unemployment rates. We have a large pool of internal manpower to use there before we should even begin to think about immigration in the first place. Anyone who argues from a pro-immigration standpoint conveniently leaves out the millions of our fellow EU citizens that are unemployed in the south.

Anyway, we are really getting into the weeds here. I’m going to sum up my position simply. Europe has low fertility rates, and there is room to increase them. Coincidentally, policies that could increase them would make life better/easier for citizens. There is money in the budget for this, and should be tried. We probably won’t hit 2.1, but 1.8 is better than 1.6. Immigration can only go so far, as we get lower quality migrants than the US/Canada (due to them being first choice destinations) and there is a limited amount of social tension we can handle due to this immigration. Ultimately, some combo of the two will be necessary or we end up being nothing more than a pawn between larger nations like the US and China.",,/r/europe/comments/dco7vy/demographics_in_europe_the_commuter_belt_effect/f33keq1/,EuroDemos,1570640173

 ALL-UK CUSTOMS UNION UNDER IRISH BACKSTOP

The EU has long objected to allowing the whole of the United Kingdom to remain in a customs union with the bloc under the withdrawal agreement, saying it risked prejudging the two sides’ future trade relations in what is formally just a divorce deal.

Britain sought the all-UK option to prevent a return to extensive border checks on the island of Ireland. The EU had proposed to keep the British province of Northern Ireland - but not the rest of the UK - in the EU’s orbit. This was unacceptable to London, sinking a tentative deal in mid-October.

Brussels has now agreed to an all-UK customs arrangement. But it would also impose more EU rules on Britain, much to the annoyance of Brexiteers. This arrangement will be the fall-back option pending the outcome of negotiations on an EU-British trade deal which have yet to begin.

States such as France and Germany say the additional level-playing field conditions do not go far enough in preventing Britain from offering products on the EU market at a lower price by undercutting standards that apply to member states.",,/r/europe/comments/dc99j9/irish_officials_dismiss_boris_johnsons_brexit/f32tohs/,marley67,1570625644

FAQ

What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

•	⁠Rudeness towards other Redditors,
•	⁠Spreading incorrect information,
•	⁠Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct.

2088,"&gt; Sure, some people do choose leisure over the more difficult task of raising children/a family. 

When it comes to having more than 1-2 children that's most if not almost all of people, not some.

&gt; But France with a 1.8 TFR does significantly better than say Italy, Spain or Poland at around 1.4. And if the EU as a whole reached 1.8 with a slew of family friendly policies, what exactly are we losing?

Don't overestimate it. It's only 28% more and 1.8-2.1 is the end of the spectrum. It's slowing down the process, not changing the course. As I said, 3 factors counts here. High GDP and HDI, pro-fertility policies and the immigrant factor. You seem to ignore the importance of the last factor, France has what it has because of +100k, mostly young people immigranting there yearly. But the thing is all these things are tied together and start with high GDP(!) compared to the geopolitical neighbourhood. You won't have better pro-fertility policy without GDP, that is money and without high HDI, which also depends on GDP in the first place. You won't have also immigrants to fill your pyriamid age gaps without high GDP. That's why if you want to slow down the decrase, you need to invest not in fertility policies, but in your economy first(!) to provide these pro-family policies and to be attractive for immigrants later. That's when you get those 1.8.

We're loosing if pro-fertility policies are pushed beyond the capacity of the current economy, despite not having a great GDP and HDI, because then this is money spent on a policy that won't work as every such example of a semi-developed country proven and at the same time this money is wasted instead of being invested in actual GDP growth. At the end of the day, the perspective of reaching 1.8 instead of getting closer, goes away. In this case it's not worth it, because the fertility won't get bigger compared to the cost. Poland, Hungary are good examples.

&gt; why not introduce policies that both increase the standard of living and increase the fertility rate? It’s not as if we are being coercive, that I could understand, but opposition to helping people live better lives AND increase births in one go seems illogical.

As mentioned before, it won't work without high GDP which is the base for high HDI and immigration. The answer for all these question is in all my previous posts. These policies are becoming 'effective' (to reach 1.8) only when the economy is rich making mentioned 3 factors avalible. High HDI is a derivative of GDP growth, not certain policies, these are nuances and addons.

&gt; So productivity is an interesting one. Here in Central &amp; Eastern Europe, our economies grow only because we have so much technological/economic catching up to do with the West (not to mention hefty EU subsidies).Once this process is complete, we will plateau and decline as demographics fully kick in.

Yes, probably there will be a decline of population. Quite possible both processes will took place partly in the same tame covering each other. How does it work? The side effect of the decline and potentially also further increase in productivity is that your GDP per capita and HDI will skyrocket at that point. That will skyrocket income per capita. Which will make you attractive for immigrants and there will be a lot more money per capita enabling pro-fertility policies to have any impact. Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia are starting(!) to see this process right now and these countries are more and more welcoming to immigrants, and most important, they became attractive to some of them. I predict that in about 20 years their fertility rates will increase to 1.7-1.8 being inside the process I'm describing here, but where France is now.

&gt; Now, I’ll also reference two points about productivity. The US has had a productivity growth rate twice as high as the EU over the last 17 years, leaving us in the dust. They also have a significantly younger average population than us. Now I know correlation isn’t causation, but it’s something to think about. When you think of famous modern innovators, make a note of their age and tell me if ti doesn’t at least make you curious of the effect youth has on innovation.

US is more productive bacause it has a more capitalist system but in large part this capitalism is a result of demographic processes, not a cause. That's a whole different topic. US has plenty of young people, but not thanks to pro-fertile policy, which is practically none, not even thank to fertile rates which are average, but thanks to immigration. A million a year. 

To explain this, let's go back to the beginning. There has always been two types of people (of course have in mind that this is a spectrum). People who are active, enterprising, brave, intelligent, up-and-coming. In literature they're sometimes called 'warriors'. In history they've often were the people who became elites, who were able to change their social class even in a slave and feudal systems. They don't want to be taken care of that much, they want to grow, develop, lead(!) and have a free hand when realising their new ideas. Today if they aren't leading politicians, it's them who want liberaism, free market, they don't care about somebody taking care about them because they usually earn more from their position and if not, they;re convinced that they're able to build a life in which they won't need any welfare. Historically, they've ended up as kings, generals, slave owners, nobility, land owners, presidents, PMs, CEOs. If they were from a lower class, they've often managed to change their social class or push for a revolution if the system didn't provide a way to do so. The second type of people is often named 'peasants' or slaves. These people are not so up-and-coming, they usually filled the labour force in all historical periods ending up as slaves, working class, peasantry, blue collars and they always were taken care of by their 'owners'. In modern times these vote for welfare, social benefits, in short - they want to be taken care of, they want to be led, just like in historical times slave or peasant owners provided shelter, work and often even schools and even medical care. 

US had a very good start and since then it's draining the world from 'warriors'. Because to start a new life in a completely new world with all your social and family ties cut down, you needed a lot of this warrior personality. These people are the backbone of the new world, especially the United States.

This created a disproportion between the old and new world and after these 5 centuries the new world has an overrepresentation of 'warriors'. Contrary to that, the old world is left with an overrepresentation of 'peasants'. That decided about the culture, and immigrants choosing US today are still mostly those which now that if they have nobody there, then nobody's going to take care of them, they need to grab a job as soon as possible. That's not the case in Europe, where the welfare model dominates. These two factors, geography (far away) and system (small welfare) decides that US get's the best people, however I'm sure the bar of 'warriorness' is lower than in XIX century.

But that doesn't mean european immigrants are trash. First of all, low-skilled people are still needed in automated enviroment because some physical aspects of work are the hardest to automate. I mean, it's easy to write a bot that's going to do statistical analyses and reports or even write a software, it's not that easy to provide a construction robot, the pay threshold when it is affordable to hire a robot there is a lot higher in these cases. Second, you can teach them some skills here or their children, which is happening. It's not true that european immigrants have only basic jobs.

&gt; You cannot simply ignore the elephant in the room, which is the fact that our underlying demographic pyramid is not conducive to a society that needs major change to escape increasing economic/political irrelevance.

I'm not. In my opinion there's simply not much anyone can do as most european countries are alerady doing it without any significant change. You won't have any effect on fertility with low GDP with policies like that because these people are focused at becoming a developed society and it has a very limited effect in countries with higher GDP (with higher HDI, immigration rate(!) and welfare possibilities). Surprising as it seems, mathematical models can predict what will be more or less your population and it's beyond single decisions of politicians, which have an extremely limited impact here. So, long-term 1.5-1.8 in a fully post-malthusian reality is avalible when your economy grows to developed countries levels, when you're attractive to immigrants and when there's actual money to distribute in various ways (like free kindergarten) to families without making a bigger harm to the economy.

Also, you need to remember one thing. 2.1 bar is for countries with very low children death rates and low death rates in general in 15-55 group. Europe, Japan, and so on. In a country which is at war or which has many internal conflicts but after the demographic transition, the bar is isn't 2.1, but higher. Libya is a good example here. So in some countries you end up with the same effect having 2.1 as in Ireland with let's say a 1.8. It's good to remember that when analyzing TFR tables, birth rates isn't everything and for example many countries in the muslim world reached the situation in which european countries are long time ago, but because of higher violence levels and death rate in 15-55 groups 2.1 or 2.2 isn't enough just like 1.8 isn't enough in Europe to keep the population number constant.",,/r/europe/comments/dco7vy/demographics_in_europe_the_commuter_belt_effect/f32ntxd/,Ahtuardyef,1570619676

2098,"*Some additional details:*

The video did not actually show him doing coke, but the anonymous  leaker (who claims to be a lawyer, closely related to the mayor's circles) accused him of that and promised further evidence on his blog in the following days (leading up to the elections). He also accused the mayor (and other participants of the orgy) with corruption; more details and evidence is also promised for these accusations as well.

The leaked photos and videos explicitly show the mayor and his friends in the company of three young women (in their early 20s), who are allegedly prostitutes, engaging in various sexual activities. Later it was reported by the independent press, that one of the girls has also received EU funds for her fashion business in 2018. The orgy took place on a yacht near Dubrovnik and besides the mayor and the girls, at least three additional people were present - all of them the friends and business partners of the mayor, who were involved in some shady dealings  in and near the city of Győr.

After a few days of hiding from the public, the mayor (who is the politician of the ruling party, Fidesz) has appeared in a short video, admitting that he indeed participated in the orgy and apologized for his behaviour, but denied any claims of corruption and using any illegal substances. He also stressed that he is not going to abdicate or step back from candidacy the coming elections .

It is noteworthy that since a few months the main ideology of Fidesz, proclaimed by Viktor Orbán himself, is the conservative ""Christian Democeacy"" or ""Christian Liberalism"". The ruling party often justifies its controversial acts and legislatures as defending the Christian traditions of Hungary and Europe. 

The mayor often propagated himself in the past few months as a devout Christian, and a proud family man, and a staunch protector of the Christian values.",,/r/europe/comments/de0v7u/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20191006/f32nw96/,bandi2289,1570619754

2104,"The US is looking at ways to funnel money to Huawei’s European rivals, as officials warn that the Chinese company is becoming dangerously dominant in the global race for the next generation of mobile communications.

Officials in the US government have suggested issuing credit to companies such as Nokia and Ericsson to enable them to match the generous financing terms that Huawei offers to its customers, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.

The move is part of a wider push to fund a rival to the Chinese company, which is the largest telecoms equipment maker in the world, but which the US believes poses a security risk to it and its allies.

One senior government official said: “We gave up our superiority in making telecoms equipment decades ago, and now we are realising that this might not have been the best choice for national security reasons. Almost every department and agency is desperately looking right now for ways to get back into this game.”

“If we don’t, Huawei could soon be the only option for anyone wanting to roll out 5G networks.”

Another said: “This is one of the big concerns of the government right now. Everyone from the defence department, to the commerce department, to the department of homeland security, is looking at this.” The White House declined to comment.

Huawei sells 28 per cent of the world’s telecoms equipment, according to Dell’Oro, the market research company. Ericsson and Nokia are its closest rivals. Both companies declined to comment.

To the consternation of the Trump administration, there is no US group that can build the radio equipment to transfer signals between mobile phones and the towers or sites that make up the network.

Some officials believe the best way to counteract Huawei’s dominance is to make sure its rivals can match the Chinese company’s multibillion-dollar credit lines from China’s state banks that allow it to offer much longer payment terms than most of its rivals.

Others in Washington are pushing instead to foster a homegrown rival to Huawei, and have asked large American telecoms equipment companies such as Oracle and Cisco whether they would consider entering the radio transmission market. 

Both companies have rebuffed such suggestions, according to two people familiar with the discussions, warning it would be too expensive and time-consuming to do so. 

The Trump administration is also looking closely at incentives to encourage US companies to invest in new 5G technology, including software which enables pieces of equipment from different companies to communicate with each other.

This would allow telecoms providers to buy equipment off the shelf from multiple vendors, rather than relying on one company to build an entire network, the kind of work in which Huawei specialises.

For example, officials have been in talks with Altiostar, a Massachusetts-based company that makes such software, to work out how to support it.

Possibilities include funding rural internet providers with hundreds of millions of dollars to rip out Huawei equipment and replace it with American or western technology — a plan which is currently making its way through Congress. 

Altiostar is also urging the administration to force hardware companies to make their products accessible to its software, while some of its backers want additional tax breaks to encourage US participation on international telecoms standards bodies.

Thierry Maupilé, executive vice-president at Altiostar, said in an interview: “We do not need to create another Huawei, there is an alternative. Our product is very attractive to the administration, but we need them to help support the US supply chain.”",Previously Germany,/r/europe/comments/df4ev9/the_us_is_considering_funneling_money_to_nokia/f32i9ml/,Xaethon,1570611182

A hypothetical scenario meant to strengthen my main point. See further down.

&gt;soviet=anti-fascis

No, but anyone who fought against the Nazis in WW2 was an anti-fascist by definition - it just means someone opposed to the nazis. The Yanks and Brits bombing the shit out of children in Germany were also anti-fascists, even if their actions were, in my book, heinous. However - we're talking the ''original'' anti-fascists - those who did the legwork to destroy a regime that was genocidal by design of their ideology. Fighting against it as an action is as good as feeding lonely puppies or being charitable. 

&gt;  when a Soviet military man is torturing a Latvian prisoner first as an ally of Nazis 

Yeah, the day when the war broke out and the torturer monster mass-murdered started fighting against the Nazis, he became  an anti-fascist monster mass-murderer. 

&gt;How do you imagine them becoming anti-fascists? 

By fighting against Nazi Germany. If you fight the Nazis you're anti-fascist. Full-stop. Again - you act as if being anti-fascist means the person is automatically good - which I did not say. Anti-fascism, however, as an action, much like charity, is good. Nazis were fans of animal rights - which is good, but that does not make them good people by any definition.

&gt; as a noble anti-fascist 

As I keep reiterating - no one said anything about **noble** anti-fascists. I've made my point here on Reddit more than enough times how I detest the totalitarian Soviet empire. In any case - my main point was that the state ideology of Russia that celebrates anti-fascism (which is good) does not adhere to the reality of their country being infested top-to-down with fascists and fascist ideology adherents.

2194,"For 15 years, Antoni Peruta worked in Manchester, one of more than 2m Poles who left their country in the early 2000s in search of a better life abroad. But in 2017, convinced that the central European nation’s economy was improving under the ruling Law and Justice party, he decided it was time to return home.
“Once there was a normal government, I came back,” he says, watching sceptically as a politician from Law and Justice’s predecessors and main rivals, Civic Coalition, canvasses voters in the market square of Wlodawa, a town in Poland’s poorer eastern region. “I was forced to leave because it was impossible to live. But now it’s completely different. Things have stabilised. [Life] is very good. And it keeps on getting better.”
“Talk to the families,” he adds, gesturing to two young couples pushing prams down an adjoining street. “[Ask them]: would they like Civic Coalition to come back? We would chase them away with axes! That’s what the opinion is.”

On Sunday, Poles will head for the voting booths in what politicians on both sides of a bitter partisan divide have branded the most important election since their country threw off communism in 1989 — and the economic progress that has won over Mr Peruta may well turn out to be Law and Justice’s trump card.

Over the past three decades, Poland has been through a dizzying social, political and economic transition. Within a generation, the country has transformed itself from a Soviet vassal state with a failing, centrally-planned economy into an independent democracy with surging growth. In 1999, it joined Nato. In 2004, it joined the EU, and in the years that followed, many assumed that Poland was on a one-way track to deeper political and economic convergence with its allies in the west.
The past four years have challenged that assumption. Since coming to power in 2015, the conservative-nationalist Law and Justice has pushed back against EU integration, and the bloc’s liberal social values. To the consternation of many in Brussels, and more at home, it has ridden roughshod through checks and balances, subordinating judges to politicians and reducing state media to a claque. Many liberals fear that the vote is the last chance to stop the country sliding into the kind of semi-authoritarian netherworld that Viktor Orban has created in Hungary.

For Law and Justice voters, something completely different is at stake. During the past four years, many have seen their everyday lives improved by the batch of generous welfare policies that Law and Justice has introduced. Others have been cheered by its promotion of Catholic-infused conservative values. When they vote in Sunday’s parliamentary election, it will be to keep those policies. And with opinion polls suggesting a lead of more than 15 points, the party is likely to emerge victorious.
At first glance, the timing of Law and Justice’s success might seem surprising. Whereas populist movements in the west, from the US to the UK, have often gained ground in times of economic stagnation, Law and Justice, founded and led by rightwing firebrand Jaroslaw Kaczynski, has come to the fore while Poland is enjoying one of the longest booms in its history.
Since Leszek Balcerowicz introduced the epoch-making package of reforms — dubbed “shock therapy” — which began Poland’s journey to capitalism in 1989, the country’s economy has almost trebled in size. It has not had a recession since 1992, a streak bettered only by Australia. Based on purchasing power parity, Poles are now richer than Greeks and closing in on the Portuguese. Growth in gross domestic product — which topped 5 per cent in 2018 — has been among the highest in the developed world in recent years.
“Poland is the poster child for a successful transition,” says Beata Javorcik, chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. “Within 30 years the country moved from a situation with shortages of essentially everything — empty shelves in shops, where . . . many products from meat, butter and cigarettes to chocolate and vodka were rationed — to joining the club of rich countries.”
The Balcerowicz reforms paved the way for spectacular macroeconomic success. But the rough and tumble of Poland’s transition also created losers. Millions lost their jobs as state-owned farms closed, and state-owned companies folded in the face of western competition. Although Poles grew richer, inequality began to rise. 
“A lot of discontent in transition countries comes from changes in relative position,” says Ms Javorcik. “And these changes are often exacerbated by changes in global trends, globalisation and technological progress.” 
Former prime minister Donald Tusk’s centre-right Civic Platform — which ruled Poland from 2007 to 2015 and forms the backbone of today’s Civic Coalition — saw the country successfully through the financial crisis and embarked on a big programme to improve infrastructure. Yet many Poles, particularly in rural areas and in the poorer east, felt the benefits of Poland’s boom had passed them by. When Law and Justice ran against Civic Platform in 2015, it made promises of a big jump in welfare spending ;one of the central planks of its campaign.

The flagship policy was a child benefit scheme, dubbed 500+, that pledged a monthly payment of 500 zlotys for every second and subsequent child, a sum that could provide larger families with the equivalent of another salary. Economists were sceptical about its affordability, but so far the government has been able to fund the scheme, thanks to a booming economy and a clampdown on VAT fraud. 
This year, it was expanded to cover all children. “It’s completely changed the situation for many families,” says Elzbieta Kotermanowicz, a retiree attending a Law and Justice rally in the central city of Plock last month. “I travel a lot in Poland, and when you go to resorts, especially during the holidays, you see families who would never have allowed themselves such a trip if it wasn’t for this programme.”
The significance of the policy was that it was not just about redistributing cash. It was also about “redistributing prestige” to those who felt overlooked, as Ludwik Dorn — once one of Mr Kaczynski’s closest allies — once put it.
￼
“The first 500+ programme obviously had an element of [providing] financial means, of material goods. But it also had an extremely important element related to dignity . . . to the redistribution of social respect by the state,” he says. “[The message was: Donald Tusk’s Civic Platform] didn’t listen to you because they did not acknowledge and respect you. We do.”
Law and Justice appeals not only to Poles who feel they lost out, says Agata Szczesniak, a commentator from OKO.press, an online news portal, but also to those who feel the country’s pursuit of European integration has left its own traditions and identity in danger of being erased by imported values.
“For many years, people in Poland were trying to be like people from the west,” she says. “But now I think more and more feel that it’s OK to say: we are Poles . . . we identify with our community, with our region . . . This is something the opposition doesn’t get.”

Law and Justice has buttressed its welfare policies with relentless attacks on LGBT rights, which it portrays as a foreign threat to traditional Polish family values, in much the same way as it identified Muslim refugees as a threat in 2015. “This is an attack on the family, and the family is the . . . foundation of Polish civilisation,” Mr Kaczynski told a convention in Krosno last weekend.
“The journey from civic partnerships via gay marriage to the adoption of children, is one [the opposition] will certainly take. They will take it, to destroy our culture. To destroy what is the basis of our life, our existence and our survival. Because the family is also the basis of our survival, not just in a biological sense . . . but also in a cultural sense.”
The ruling party’s position has been strengthened by the weakness of the opposition. Law and Justice has recently been hit by a string of scandals, ranging from the use of government jets by a top official’s family members, to allegations that a deputy justice minister was involved in a smear campaign against judges who criticised reforms. Yet the opposition has been unable to capitalise.
￼
Part of the reason is state media’s tireless support for the government and its relentless attacks on the opposition, as well as support from the Church for Law and Justice. But Civic Coalition’s problems also lie closer to home. It lacks a charismatic leader. It has struggled to renew itself after defeat in 2015. And, faced with the emergence of a new leftwing coalition, it seems unsure whether to try and defeat Law and Justice by winning back moderate conservatives, or instead by trying to consolidate Poland’s liberal forces.
“People were really tired with Civic Platform,” says Ms Szczesniak. “After eight years people wanted change. And this party wasn’t changing. Its most popular politician, Donald Tusk, left and went abroad [to the European Council]. And people perceive its politicians as old, tired and cynical.”
Too often, Law and Justice’s critics have showed contempt and incomprehension for those who supported the party. “Sometimes a beautiful woman forgets herself and gives herself to some bastard,” Adam Michnik, a former dissident and editor-in-chief of the liberal newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, said in 2016 when asked why Poles had voted in Law and Justice. “But I believe that Poland will sober up.”
Three years on Law and Justice seems certain to emerge as the biggest party from Sunday’s poll. However, Poland’s electoral system means that, depending on how many parties make it into parliament, it could still end up short of a majority. This leaves a faint possibility that a broad — though probably unstable — coalition of opposition parties could club together to try and form a government. Mobilisation will be key for all parties, and Mr Kaczynski has taken to finishing rallies by imploring his supporters not just to vote, but to persuade their friends to do so too.
￼
“It’s not a done deal,” says Aleks Szczerbiak, professor of politics at the University of Sussex. “It really does matter whether Law and Justice gets an overall majority. Because if it doesn’t there is a serious chance that there could be an alternative government formed.”
The most likely outcome, however, remains that the 70-year-old Mr Kaczynski will be given the chance to continue his crusade to reshape Poland. “Maybe it’s a bit exaggerated but when we look at Orban’s Hungary we are going more or less in the same direction,” says Anna Materska-Sosnowska, a political scientist at the University of Warsaw. 
“A central state providing care from birth . . . to retirement . . . But also a state that controls how you are supposed to live, with whom you are supposed to live, and what should be the model of your family.”

New coalition heralds return of the left 

In the 2015 election, Poland’s left was split between two camps — neither made it into parliament. Leftwingers were left unrepresented in the Sejm (lower house) for the first time since the country’s return to democracy.
Four years on, Poland’s three main leftwing groups have joined forces and are set to return to the parliamentary fray. Polls suggest the new Lewica coalition could win about 13 per cent of the vote, which would make it the third-largest group in parliament.
The left’s failure in 2015 had far-reaching consequences, allowing Law and Justice to gain a parliamentary majority, despite winning only 38 per cent of the vote. Its return will probably have a significant impact on Poland’s political discourse, according to Ryszard Luczyn of analysts Polityka Insight.
“For the last four years, we have had a parliament without the left. Now we will have a political force that will not be afraid about speaking about abortion [rights], about separating church and state,” he says.
The leftwing coalition has put social and ecological issues at the heart of its agenda. As well as loosening Poland’s strict abortion laws, it is pushing for equal pay for women, an increase in the minimum wage and civic partnerships. It wants the majority of Polish energy to come from renewable sources by 2035.
But the big question is how stable the coalition will prove to be. Lewica brings together three parties with very different backgrounds: the SLD, which dominated Poland in the late 1990s and early 2000s before being felled by scandals; Razem, a group set up in 2015 as a rival to the SLD; and Wiosna, a party set up in February by Robert Biedron, a former mayor, which quickly imploded after a disappointing result in European elections.
“I think Wiosna will probably merge with the SLD. The question is then Razem, but at the moment the co-operation seems OK,” says Mr Luczyn",Germany,/r/europe/comments/dfefsh/poland_election_the_unfinished_counterrevolution/f32ix8o/,Hematophagian,1570612299

&gt;  If you want to decree people to like other people without reason then you’re for a big surprise. 

These topics tend to bring out a tendency to exaggerate the point of the people you're disagreeing with so I'll try to be charitable. 

No-one wants to force people to like other people. If there's one thing the LGBTQ+ community is acutely aware of, it's that you don't always choose who you like :-)

We're not talking about a vague disliking here, though. 

Some quotes from the article:

&gt;Archbishop Marek Jedraszewski labelled the community a ""rainbow plague"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Powerful PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, widely viewed as Poland's de facto powerbroker, thanked the cleric for his words and accused the LGBT community of posing a ""threat"" to the traditional family.

And

&gt; ""Gay pride and other LGBT marches are provocations against society,"" the 50-year-old told AFP. 

As well as

&gt; Earlier this year, PiS-allied Lublin authorities handed out awards to local officials for publicly opposing ""LGBT ideology"", which they said, ""goes against the family, the nation and the Polish state"". 

And

&gt; ""We consider it harmful and oppose it being promoted by public institutions.""

None of those particularly read as ""no-one care or tells you who you should be involved with."" The testimony from the LGBTQ+ people in the article shows a similar trend.

What these people, and by extension: you, are saying here is that LGBTQ+ people wanting to visibly exist and make sure that information about LGBTQ+ topics is harmful and should be opposed.",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/deyzl2/polands_lgbt_community_under_fire_ahead_of/f32eh41/,StayAtHomeDadaist,1570605039

2416,"Yeah, no. Total of 39 or 40 Britons died during Berlin Airlift mostly to non-flying related accidents. Total of 8 British aircraft crashed during the airlift, but not all of crashes resulted in loss of life. Bottom line is, that's rate of attrition barely above what you'd expect from peacetime military unit deployed in occupied Germany at the time. That's not exactly surprising considering that's what effectively Berlin airlift was: supply chain for occupation forces (as well as civilians) present in Berlin at the time. It was not done under enemy fire and only adverse conditions were effectively regular hazards related to flying in that period.  It was great example of brilliant planning, logistics and command&amp;control, but not really extraordinary feat of actual flying. Using word ""sacrifice"" in relation to those people is quite insulting to those who actually sacrificed their lives for the cause of freedom and democracy both during the war against Germans, but also against Soviets.

Also small footnote here: British managed to lose more people than Americans despite delivering nearly 4 times less cargo. Considering neither party actually lost that many people there's no way to really say anything conclusive, but still it does raise a question just how competent RAF was.

&gt;Few books published in Russia during the post-communist period have exerted such an influence on Russian military, police, and foreign policy elites as Aleksandr Dugin’s 1997 neo-fascist treatise Osnovy geopolitiki: Geopoliticheskoe budushchee Rossii (Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geo-political Future of Russia). The impact of this intended “Eurasianist” textbook on key Russian elites testifies to the worrisome rise of fascist ideas and sentiments during the late Yeltsin and the Putin periods.

So, where are the sources? Words of individual representatives of the Russian Ministry, Russian journalists? Links to existing journalistic research? Or at least for existing articles? Nope. Just point-blank statement. Alright. But I don't know either the author or this magazine. Let's open the articles for [the same month](https://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/2004-no-3) to make sure this author / journal is objective before I believe them by word:

&gt; [By most conventional measures of power—economic, military, and cultural—there has never been an empire mightier than that of the United States today.](https://www.hoover.org/research/reluctant-empire)

&gt;[Why low drug prices in Canada are too good to be true](https://www.hoover.org/research/high-price-cheap-drugs)

&gt;[**Eurabia?** Niall Ferguson examines the impact of Europe’s growing Muslim population on a continent that otherwise faces low birthrates and aging populations.](https://www.hoover.org/research/eurabia)

Something tells me that this journal has a certain kind of narrative and the smallest share of bias...

Let's check the second source.

""The Unlikely Origins of Russia’s Manifest Destiny"" by [Charles Clover](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/27/geopolitics-russia-mackinder-eurasia-heartland-dugin-ukraine-eurasianism-manifest-destiny-putin/)

&gt;The Englishman’s elevation to the status of grand mufti of Atlantic power was assisted by Dugin, who in 1997 published The Foundations of Geopolitics, one of the most curious, impressive, and terrifying books to come out of Russia during the entire post-Soviet era, and one that became a pole star for a broad section of Russian hardliners. 

Still waiting for sources. 

&gt;“There has probably not been another book published in Russia during the post-communist period which has exerted a comparable influence on Russian military, police, and statist foreign policy elites,” writes historian John Dunlop, a Hoover Institution specialist on the Russian right.

Well, at least something. Let's check that John Dunlop words. Wait. This is the same dude that wrote the first article! [Dunlop, John B. (July 30, 2004) ""Russia’s New—and Frightening—“Ism”""](https://www.hoover.org/research/russias-new-and-frightening-ism). 

Alright, let's google his work, maybe there something more. Google show us this [article](https://bigthink.com/paul-ratner/the-dangerous-philosopher-behind-putins-strategy-to-grow-russian-power-at-americas-expense)

&gt;The Most Dangerous Philosopher in the World
&gt;[Here’s a paper on Dugin and his book by Hoover Institution’s John B. Dunlop](http://www.4pt.su/en/content/aleksandr-dugin%E2%80%99s-foundations-geopolitics). 


Yeah, an [article](http://www.4pt.su/en/content/aleksandr-dugin%E2%80%99s-foundations-geopolitics). The first thing I want to note is that if you go to the main page of this site, then you fucking see this fucking [shit](http://www.4pt.su/en/content/radical-object-necro-ontology-dark-enlightenment-negarestanis-philosophy). But let's read text:

&gt;Two years later, at the founding congress of the new “Eurasia” movement, Dugin boasted, “I am the author of the book Foundation of Geopolitics, which has been adopted as a textbook in many [Russian] educational institutions.” During the same congress, the aforementioned General Klokotov – now a professor emeritus but one who continued to teach at the academy – noted that the theory of geopolitics had been taught as a subject at the General Staff Academy since the early 1990’s, and that in the future it would “serve as a mighty ideological foundation for preparing a new [military] command.” [25].  Dugin’s book is presumably being used at present as a textbook at the General Staff Academy.

This is a serious statement. And it is even backed up by some source.

&gt;See “[Stenogramma raboty uchreditel’nogo s’’ezda Obshcherossiiskogo Politicheskogo Obshchestvennogo](http://eurasia.com.ru:8101/syezd.htm). 

Well, this is a broken Russian and the link is already dead, but let's google it anyway.

[Стенограмма работы учредительного съезда ОПОД «Евразия»](http://eurasia.com.ru/stenogramma.html)

&gt;Therefore, there is a proposal to give, nevertheless, a lecture to the Academy of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Nikolai Klokotov.

&gt;Dear comrades, colleagues, friends! I don’t want to make any kind of speech here, or take some detailed topic, I would just like to congratulate everyone that we finally managed to make sense of ourselves as sons of the fatherland, to get together here and, holding hands together, start to promote our Eurasian idea into the practical affairs of our country.&lt;...&gt;As a man who has served in the armed forces for more than forty years, I am a professor of strategy of the General Staff, I have always stood and will remain in our Eurasian positions, and I think that at the time I came, literally 7-8 years ago, to the General Staff Academy, the theory of geopolitics and Eurasianism itself **will be further developed and served** as a powerful ideological base for the preparation of our command personnel. This is what we are doing. I am sure that we will always have healthy forces among the people and the armed forces **will be** brought up in Eurasian traditions and ideas. Thank you for attention.

Even taking into account the fact that they are all participants in a fucking sect (read this transcript in full, they are crazy, lol), he still spoke in the **future tense**. 

So, in the end of all of this, the only source is the sect participant-Lieutenant, who said that he would like to use these sectarian things in his department. And Dugin himself, assuring that everyone uses his book. They just trust the person who writes about the existence of the fucking Order of Unicorns and the existence of secret Russian government.

The problem is that I personally do not really trust the person who writes about fucking ""[Vampire orders](https://www.e-reading.club/chapter.php/85174/22/Dugin_-_Konspirologiya.html)"":

&gt;Feminism only meant ""the struggle of women for equality in the Masonic lodges."" &lt;...&gt; In Germany a different branch of occult feminism developed, connected with the ariosophical lodges, which was also accepted not only by brothers, but also by sisters. However, here feminism was not so aggressive, and often the initiators of the ""magic matriarchy"" were men. It is especially interesting that women took the most active part in the extreme racist organizations of the so-called ""Hermanenorden"". Some offshoots of this movement - and extremely magical sense - have also moved to political circles.

Firstly the GFA doesn't require an open border with Ireland its not something that is mentioned in the agreement the High court in Northern Ireland have all ready ruled that the agreement will not be broken by a no deal brexit or a hard border.

*“Neither NIA 1998 nor the international treaty scheduled to the Belfast Agreement (or, for that matter, the Agreement itself) has the effect in law of requiring the continued membership of the EU on the part of the UK.*

*The Supreme Court was alert to this in Miller: see \[129\]. Furthermore, none of the sources mentioned subjects the EU 27 to conclude an Article 50 Withdrawal Agreement in any particular terms.”*

*“Once again, neither the Belfast Agreement nor this suite of provisions was predicated on the basis that UK membership of the EU would continue forever.* ***Neither of them can be construed as requiring a customs Union or continued regulatory alignment.*** *More fundamentally, there is no sufficient evidential foundation for the incompatibility asserted. There is no suggestion that the incompatibility has already materialised”*

&gt;GFA which essentially allows NI to sit in the middle between Ireland and the UK

NI isn't sat in the middle between NI and the UK, as part of the agreement Ireland agreed that NI was a full and undisputed part of the UK and renounced any territorial claim to it.

&amp;#x200B;

The GFA requires 3 main things. 

1. Irish citizens can get the same rights as British citizens in NI when it comes to working, claiming benefits, etc. 
2. If it seems a majority of NI population would rather be part of Ireland than the UK there will be a referendum on NI rejoining with the republic. 
3. NI will not be separated from the UK for any reason with the exception of point 2. 

The first 2 points were to placate Irish republicans the last was to satisfy the NI unionists. 

The last point is why unionists in the NI are so strongly opposed the backstop and why David Trimble one of the original negotiators of the agreement threatened to take the UK goverment to court if the backstop made it through parliament.

Because in Pilsen cars get rescued even by trams, which you perhaps won't experience anywhere else in the world. The Pilsen City Transport Company spokeperson confirmed that in the case when a car stops right after it goes onto the railway, it's usually possible to rescue it with a tram which Pilsner tram drivers have successfully done multiple times.

Secondly, Brussels has excliptly said they do not recognize the alleged statements by Merkel as what has been agreed with her:

&gt;[Brussels sources said they did not recognise the comments attributed to Merkel as being the agreed policy of the EU.](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/boris-johnson-ready-to-give-up-on-brexit-deal)

BBC also reports others in EU being skeptical Merkel had said such thing:

&gt;[The BBC understands there was ""scepticism"" in the EU that Mrs Merkel would have used such language.](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-49974362)

Merkels ally from German parliaments foreign affairs committee also indicated claimed statement of Merkel is not something Germany has agreed:

&gt;[Norbert Rottgen, an ally of the chancellor who is chair of the Bundestag's Foreign Affairs Committee, said there was ""no new German position"".](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49970267)

The Article even reports how ""a fierce debate erupted over the accuracy of a statement from a ‘No. 10 source’"", referring to the claimed quote by Merkel. The Article goes on:

&gt;[People with experience of dealing with the German Chancellor said this description didn’t reflect the style and tone she uses during official exchanges. The Times’ Brussels correspondent, Bruno Waterfield, tweeted, “veteran diplomats and Brexit negotiators… don’t recognise the Downing Street account of the Merkel call.”](https://www.thearticle.com/merkels-disastrous-call-to-boris-tells-you-all-you-need-to-know-about-eu-backstop-policy)

*1.Without prejudice to Article 160, if no mutually agreed solution has been reached within 3 months after a written notice has been provided to the Joint Committee in accordance with Article169(1), the Union or the United Kingdom may request the establishment of an arbitration panel. Such request shall be made in writing to the other party and to the International Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The request shall identify the subject matter of the dispute to be broughtbefore the arbitration panel and a summary of the legal arguments in support of the request*

2854,"&gt;EU said it is unacceptable, because Ireland said it is unacceptable. Because this would mean Northern Ireland could unilaterally decide not to renew the customs union forcing a hard border.

Any country should be able to unlilaterally pull out of the customs union. Indeed that's what article 50 is about.

If the people of Northern Ireland want to pull out, and they vote to do so, the should be allowed. The Good Friday Agreement was all about consent (and spelt it out in many ways).

What the Irish Republic afre saying is ""It's unacceptable that Northern ireland should have a democratic say."" They're also saying, ""We don't believe in the Good Friday Agreement which says that everything should happen with consent, and that Northern Ireland should not be forced to leave the UK without consent"".

The mask has slipped: the EU is undemocratic, and as for the Irish Republic, they tried to seize NI through terrorism, now they're trying to get hold of it through the EU without consent - either way (murder/colonisation), above all they don't want the people of NI to have a vote on their own future. 

&gt;The long and short of this is that Ireland has UK by the balls

Threatening to kill people (as Varadkar did in an EU summit where he waved a newspaper showing Protestants killed in Omagh and threatened to restart the terrorism if he didn't get his way), and threatening to annexe a territory without the consent of the people, might excite Irish people like you.

of course human rights don't apply universally. that is not possible and no country exists where this the case. human rights are an ideal that one can strive to aprroximate towards but governments and societies continuously choose to infringe an individual's human right if there's an reasonable public interest or the common good wheighs more that the individual's right. not only can the state of austria coerce me to conduct forced labor (military service) but also Austria directly discriminates me based on my gender (forced labor only for men). [vegan property owners](https://www.diepresse.com/5112697/waldbesitzer-darf-jagd-nicht-verbieten) cannot dispose over their own private property freely because the court decided that the public interest to allow hunting is more important than the individual's property rights. in germany, there is a discussion now to expropriate large companies due to the horrendous real estate prices, as you are probably aware. so there are an abundance of examples, where human rights don't ""apply universaly"".

&gt; At a conference of Germany's interior ministers later this month, the states will again have to decide whether to extend the deportation ban to Syria. The vote must be unanimous.

3104,"&gt; first of all we were talking about communism not socialism.

&gt; but since you want to equate it, let me quote lenin: ""the ultimate goal of socialism is communism""

But it doesn't really make sense as to this date no communist country existed. And just because the Chinese parts is called Chinese Communist Party doesn't mean they are communist, similar how North Korea having democratic in their name doesn't make them a democracy.

&gt; there has yet to be a communist country that didn't start killing it's own people on a mass scale at some point. 

There has yet to even be a communist country.

But for argument's sake, then what about Vietnam? Maybe I'm completely mistaken, but the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Vietnam) about their massacres shows that there was only one incident where Vietnam did something to its own people and even then the claim is suspect, as one can't find much about it than a blog. And even then it wasn't mass scale but ""only"" 250. Compare that to all the massacres the West and South Korea (which is practically part of the west but still) did.

&gt; it's a horrible repressive system that depends on people not thinking about personal liberty rather the needs of the collective. 

While it may suck, I don't really see how those attributes would make socialist/communism bad. That's called having different values/culture, I suppose. You may dislike it, but you aren't really the standard of how people must live.

&gt; and yes, people have died and will die in other forms of government but communism remains as the reigning champion of tyranny. 

And how? If you mean with tyranny non-democratic, then yes, maybe, but not sure about the general meaning.

&gt; i have no pretenses about the bad side of capitalism, and democracy. it's a flawed system to be sure, but it's still the best thing we've got.

Sure, and that's always said by the people in that system. 

The same would be said by the Chinese in China too, that they system is flawed but is the best option. And for example from a Chinese perspective this does make quite a big amount of sense, because they can always look at India, which comparatively speaking is a heaven for democracy, yet it's much less developed than China and people are less wealthy in general.

People say ""capitalist and democracy aren't flawless, but it's the best we got"" falls into the same logical fallacy as the one Chinese people would have.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/deuxoi/italian_communist_party_leader_tears_up_eu/f2zv244/,CDWEBI,1570539342

This holiday is not to be confused with Croatia's Independence Day, which is marked each year on 8 October. The independence was proclaimed on 25 June, but due to the negotiation of the Brioni Agreement a three-month moratorium was placed on the implementation of the decision and the Parliament cut all remaining ties with Yugoslavia in October.

3250,"&gt;The new one is sleek, open, transparent, and functional, and in my personal view also gives out fresh and young vibes.

It's also boring, unoriginal and hollow. There's nothing ""young"" about the interior. It looks like your average corporate CEO office except it's on the seaside and not in the centre of the city.

Also, those small glass tables are not only ugly they're completely useless too because they're too small to put on stuff on it and they're too far away from the couch to have any significant use.

&gt;The old one is a generic classical design that has been absolutely pervasive around Europe at the time this new hotel was built, and hence the contemporary building represented a fresh and new design in the environment

And the building on the second picture isn't generic?

&gt;
&gt;Because others see them succes and think - ""hey, maybe we should go too?"". 

far right politicians claim this, but after a couple years of letting them drown, this has been proven false.

&gt;Also - who will pay for deportation? Especially when you are unable to determine their country of origin due to them having no documents?

it's a small price to pay, and if you can't determine their country of orgin.. ""innocent untill proven guilty"", it is up to us to prove they are lying and not refugees.

and those that intigrate (if we allow this to happen) pay for this for years to come.

&gt;This causes more of them to go on dangerous trip and drown on the way. Safe passages would also increase the problem. More wanting to go to bountiful EU.

again, far right myths proven to be false.

Is that the famine happened, killed a lot of innocent people, and that was mostly caused because kulaks burned their own crops and slaughtered their animals before letting them being collectivised. Who was guilty? Depending on your point of view, you can blame the communist for wanting to collectivise, or the kulaks for avoiding collectivisation by destroying everything.

I really do not care that much about the past, but this is a thing I wanted to learn and invested a lot in learning because is related to the present.

Furthermore, communism is based on a view of human nature that, well, doesn't exist. And its answer to that has always been suppression, persecution and ultimately repression and even murder.

The part of the route closest to completition is Brno-Prerov with estimated dates around 2030. The other parts (Breclav-Brno, Prerov-Ostrava-Poland) are not even on the official planning map. Czech republic has way bigger railway problems: 

* Praha-Brno - there have been talks about new high-speed line for ten years but there is still no concrete plan for a route. 
* Brno main station - a real clusterfuck of planning
* Praha-Dresden - there are actually plans that are way more advanced than this project.
* Praha-Bavaria - current lines to south Germany are more or less unusable for modern passenger and railway traffic. 

Same goes for the other countries. 

30 years after the end of communism Slovakia is still struggling to upgrade their main railway line (Bratislava-Zilina-Kosice). They are not even half way through and they started with the easy part in the lowlands. This is way more important than  Bratislava-Budapest.

Poland did a lot of upgrades in the recent years but there are still many main lines that are operated at bellow 100km/h because of decades of neglect. They first need to finish the lines between the main cities before they can start about upgrading the cross-border connections. Anything else would be political suicide.

3566,"&gt; Joseph Stalin, during the Tehran Conference during 1943, acknowledged publicly the importance of American efforts during a dinner at the conference: ""Without American machines the United Nations could never have won the war.""

Parker, Dana T. Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II, p. 8, Cypress, CA, 2013

&gt; I would like to express my candid opinion about Stalin's views on whether the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany and survived the war without aid from the United States and Britain. First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were ""discussing freely"" among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, and we would have lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don't think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, that is what he said. When I listened to his remarks, I was fully in agreement with him, and today I am even more so.

Khrushchev, Nikita Sergeevich; Khrushchev, Serge (2004). Memoirs of Nikita Khrushchev: Commissar, 1918-1945. Penn State Press. pp. 638–639.

3589,"Well, although the scientific consensus on climate change is undeniable, the solutions of people like Extinction Rebellion or Greta Thunberg aren't exactly built off of that consensus. 

Something like Nuclear power doesn't contribute to climate change and yet is widely panned by environmentalists as somehow equivalent to burning coal. I ain't saying Nuclear is perfect, or always the better solution, but...

It's conflating reducing environmental pollution with the preservation of the human race. 

And then so many people affiliated with Extinction Rebellion and like minded groups seem to think that true support for the cause is contingent on one supporting every single solution they themselves put forward.

Not wanting to eat organic (what about eating local crops? Avoiding monoculture?), invest in high speed trains (what about twice as many slow trains?), build dense multistorey neighborhoods and shit on suburbia (what about just building much smaller houses in the suburbs?) doesn't make me an enemy.

AND MORE SIGNIFICANTLY- nothing I have ever read says that humans are bound for Extinction with global warming! Seriously, having more frequent hurricanes isn't going to make us extinct. When over a hundred million people die every year, in what way is say, five million extra natural cause deaths going to make us extinct as a species?

3621,"Participation on the October 1st independence referendum was low because of the police violence. Also some ballot boxes that already had votes on it were confiscated during the vote by Spanish police.

In reality the referendum was supported by the majority of Catalans. As you can see in this [survey](https://www.eldiario.es/politica/catalanes-encuesta-referendum_0_687681559.html) from just days before the referendum, only 29% of Catalans said they would not vote. That means that in normal circumstances, without the police beating the voters and so on, the participation would have been higher.

&gt; The referendum had too many weird stuff to consider it as a valid result like, universal census, no voter control, no envelopes.

Well that's not true. There was definitely vote control and envelopes. I voted at the referendum and I can confirm it. 

In fact there was more control than in regular elections, due to the software system verification that was implemented, which doesn't exist in regular elections. That meant that it was impossible to vote more than one time, and the software collected information about the location and time each vote was cast (ID of the voter).

It was accurate to the point that the votes in favor of independence in the October 1st referendum were almost the same number of votes that pro-independence parties got on the December Catalan elections, being these last one a little higher (30,000 more)

&gt; you can check the results from the last Catalonian elections, in which non independent parties got more votes, but less seats.

In last Catalan elections pro-independence parties got more votes than the parties against independence: 48% in favor vs 43% against.

3636,"You are spreading lies here. I'm going to assume that you have good faith and that you simply lack the information, so I will try to give you the information:

&gt; Definitely the referendum had weird stuff. In my opinion, the best example is Palol de Revardit, a town of 358 citizens that registered 1004 votes. What a joke. This is not an isolated case and it happened in several places. Just that should be a red flag on any serious democratic procedure.

That was totally normal. It's weird that you ask this today, 2 years later, because this has been explained a thousand times. The referendum worked with universal census. That meant that every person could vote at whatever polling station he wanted from all over Catalonia. So it was normal for some towns to have more registered votes than citizens. Because it didn't had to match. In regular elections there's no universal census, so it needs to match. But it wasn't the case for the referendum.

Think of this common case that happened: at the morning police raids a small town and confiscates the ballot boxes. Therefore there's no polling station at that town, so people of this town will vote at nearby town instead. And that nearby town will have a whole lot more of votes. It's perfectly fine.

The software was ready for that, so that people could vote wherever they wanted. But obviously only one time.

&gt; Also, that software you mention was not active during the voting, so people could actually vote several times. Ballots could be handmade, there were no envelopes in several circumstances 

Software was active during the voting, people couldn't vote several times. It was literally impossible. I can confirm it because I know how it worked, and I saw it personally. I can go as much deep as you want. Every single vote was a real vote of 1 person. 100% real. Final results could ONLY accept results from 1 real ID. In the case there happen to be another extra vote not matching with an ID (which happens in real elections too), the software would automatically delete a random vote from the final results.

Again, if for some reason you don't believe me, we have the best proof ever thanks to Rajoy. 2 months after the referendum there was an election, and it's reasonable to expect that people won't change opinion just after 2 months. So the pro-independence results needed to be very similar to the referendum. Otherwise, it would mean that the referendum wasn't conducted in a clean manner. Results speak for itself:

* 1 October 2017 Catalan independence referendum: '''2,044,038 votes for independence'''

* 21 December 2017 Catalan election: '''2,078,008 votes for independence'''

What else do you need here? It's perfectly clear that the referendum was incredibly accurate. Despite the circumstances.

&gt; Ballots could be handmade, there were no envelopes in several circumstances and many ballot boxes

There were ballots and envelopes at every singe of the 2,315 polling stations across Catalonia.

&gt; And the data you quote for the elections does not count votes to En Comú Podem. Any smart reader knows that 48% + 43% is not 100%.

En Comú Podem is a neutral party regarding independence, as everybody in Catalonia knows. They stated it at that elections. That's why their votes don't go to any side.",EU,/r/europe/comments/de49n7/sunlight_through_stain_glassed_windows_sagrada/f2z704f/,Xendix,1570508546

What makes you think this idea is not too much money or you can easily gain back that money because this is long term, expensive but long term solution, so it's worth the hefty price as long as we save the Earth and we get to live another day.

what makes you think we don't end up broke and the US will become a wasteland where we don't have money anymore and everyone starts raids and take all the food and supplies and killing each other because we don't have any like its apocalypse without zombies.

&amp;#x200B;

I am religious and I believe God is telling us Earth is ALREADY dying regardless if we try to prolong the inevitable or just do nothing and making it worse. The truth of the matter is there is no permanent solution. Any solution that delusional(s) come up with is not some ""hey put the diseased body into cryo-state until we find a solution to cure him so he can live longer"". There is no ""Earth immortality"" solution. The earth is already dying (treat it like someone is bleeding out or someone is suffering, end his pain)... so let it die. We live out of our useless life.

&amp;#x200B;

The truth is: I will live my life knowing that climate change activist is demanding the UN and rich people to drop billions into something to solve a problem, is nothing, worthless and pointless and I will be there laughing because you wasted all of that money when you could've dropped it into something that could bring us into the future like curing impossible viruses with our newly developed technology that we invest shit loads in... 

OR drop loads into making stricter elementary schools, middle schools, and high school so that we can teach and guide kids so that they won't be college dropouts. Nowadays, people are handing diplomas left and right as if they work their ass off but no, it's easy and it takes no skill which is the main problem. Nowadays high school graduates end up in low-end jobs and are critically not financial set. Fuck politics and climate change, this is the main issue.

If you don't like it when Spain says that the only way for the self-determination of Catalonia is through the constitutional process, keep in mind that Catalonia had more influence in the design of that process than any other region in Spain.

Also: Catalonia is one of the richest and most prosperous regions in Europe, and thus, in the world.

3797,"Recognizing the independence of Kosovo isn't necessarily the morally righteous thing to do.

The Albanian Muslim population in Kosovo results from a relatively recent (18th-19th century) migration into a Serbian region which is basically considered a historical homeland of Serbian identity. The now de facto independent region of Kosovo also includes regions in the North, around the Northern part of the city of Mitrovica, which is over 90% Serbian. They didn't get to chose to leave Serbia, they didn't want it, and I won't start with how the remnants of Serbian minorities are treated in this de facto free Kosovo.

Obviously, the Albanian Muslim populations in Kosovo were subject to appalling ethnic cleansing during the last war. That's why so many Western countries jumped for the recognition of their independence. But unfortunately, history is more complicated, and there aren't just good guys and bad guys. There are many layers.

The reason why countries in the EU aren't acting as a monolith on complicated political issues is because these are complicated political issues, without an objective moral superior.

3818,"I'm keeping it in English for whatever poor fellow finds it interesting to follow.

I have much stronger animistic values in my family and ancestry so I may be overstating them. Just like you can understate them if you have ancestors mainly from urban/northern communities. I will not change my view that has been molded into such by my upbringing and reading Haabsaar, Masing and others. Especially when my opponent is claiming I'm wrong but has no references but his own reasoning. *And I don't expect anything less from you, as well.* I also have yet to give a source to my claims.

I know I go astray from the history taught in school, but that should not be the standard of truth. In sciences, perhaps, but not in softer subjects. But whether that deviation is false or not, is the point of this discussion. At least for me.

**You agree that forbidden acts** were regular during soviet and First Republic times when technology gave the overlords a much bigger advantage in oversight. Yet you deny it being possible at least in the same scale during medieval and preindustrial times. The counterclaim you propose is networking and influence and I don't see why it wouldn't work the same way in the times of serfdom. And I'd like some proof that only the influential ""secret society"" would celebrate Christmas (or New Year's one hour ""early"" for another example).

**As for what's actually left**, I haven't even gotten there as it would take a whole new set of discourse to agree on what's actual influence and what's not. I'd agree that Hingedepäev and Küünlapäev are all but gone and Mardi/Kadripäev on their way out. And I doubt you'd let linguistics to be counted as serious influence in our worldview without any proof.

""Hing"" is a very good example as it extends soul/spirit into breath and emanation/aura (hingamine, hingus) bringing Estonian understanding of the relationship of the body and soul much closer to eastern understanding than Christian. It also binds the earthly shell much stronger with the heavenly than in Christianity while also extending it to the animals and earth itself (maa külm hingus - the cold breathing of earth).

**It seems boring to you as neither of us have presented any proper science behind our claims** and you (and probably me as well) refuse to open the mind to the possibility that the other is right or at least that you (me) are not completely right. No shit it seems like talking to a wall.

**My premise was put forth separately for you to tear down piece by piece** and for me to learn the shortcomings or even errors in the claim. Simply saying it's bs helps no-one - especially me to improve and ""not embarrass Estonians"". My premise is based on the idea that Estonians are more than the modern blue-black-white look that has mostly been put forth by late 19th century intellectuals and university students.

Saying then something like, yeah they should just get together and gather enough support is equivalent to saying: it's not literally impossible, just in practise 99,9% impossible, which is very convinient only for those who are already happy with how things were left out in the constitution.

Let's not forget that there are points of the constitution that were forced on the population ( [like with the monarchy, where the original plan was to hold a referendum but since they saw they'd lose, they just forced it in, no appeals allowed like with everything else](https://www.eldiario.es/politica/Adolfo-Suarez-referendum-monarquia-encuestas_0_581642259.html) ).

3906,"&gt;Croatia has requested also US assistance in the search for the missing Croatian seaman Dino Miskic, who has gone missing after his Bourbon Rhode ship sank in the Atlantic, Croatia's Foreign and European Affairs Minister Gordan Grlic Radman said on Monday.

&gt;""As soon as we have new information, we will let you know,"" the minister said when asked if the US had responded to Croatia's request.

&gt;""It is a fact that we all care, that's for sure. It is our obligation and duty,"" the minister said, stressing that Croatian authorities had been involved in the search for the missing seaman 24 hours a day.

&gt;Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Grlic Radman said that together with the family and friends of the missing Croatian sea captain he believed that Miskic was alive and that not all options had been exhausted.

&gt;The minister recalled that Zagreb had also sent a request to French authorities, all merchant ships and airplanes passing through and above the area where the vessel sank.

&gt;""A search operation as extensive as this one did not happen in the last 20 years. An area of 110,000 square kilometres has been searched, which is twice the size of Croatia,"" the minister told a news conference.

&gt;The Bourbon Rhode, with a 14-member crew on board, sank on September 26 in the Atlantic, about 2,000 kilometres from the nearest mainland, the French island of Martinique. The crew were mostly Ukrainians and it also included one Russian, one South African and one Filipino. The captain was Dino Miskic, a Croatian national.

&gt;The search operation lasted for a week and resulted in the discovery of three crew members who were alive and four members who died. No other bodies have been found since October 1.

&gt;The Seafarers' Union of Croatia has called for the continuation of the active search for the seven missing seamen, noting that life rafts have not been found and that that gives them reason to believe the missing seamen could still be alive.

&gt;President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic has written to her French counterpart Emmanuel Macron, asking that the decision to suspend the active search be reconsidered.",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/depso0/fm_croatia_sought_us_assistance_in_search_for/f2xu0lm/,pobjeda,1570482514

You would not stand up to a German woman who was mass raped by Soviet troops and say that what happened to her was more understandable because she's German. You would not tell a German who was expelled, tortured and had all of his belongings stolen due to arbitrary medieval borders due to petty nationalism (K. Of Bohemia for Czechia and Piast for Poland) that it was justifiable. 

Because it was not. We all should own up about the shit our countries did. World War 2 isn't a game of Good vs. Evil no matter how you look at it. It was the last great struggle between empires and a great nationalist conflict. While the Nazis genocided the slavs, the British caused the Bengali famine in India while the Soviets raped Polish women because, in the words of Joe Stalin,""I understand it if a soldier who has crossed thousands of kilometres through blood and fire and death has fun with a woman or takes some trifle."" It's not a black and white struggle for freedom and it never was. Germany is treated as an outlier because Germany lost. That's a harsh truth. That's the reason, by my previous example, the Indian genocide in the US is barely even mentioned while having a scale destruction far larger than the holocaust.

It wasn't proportional to the damage the Nazis caused, that's for damn sure. The Nazis were genocidal maniacs. But war isn't a game of numbers. It's still from 1 million to 2 million potentially innocent Germans dead from the expulsions from their homeland.

His opposition is poor, but he absolutely uses those tactics. Same with Vučić in Serbia. The opposition is incompetent but even they weren't they have one hell of an uphill battle. Besides, Milo's an old school bastards. Some school of dictatorship as Slobo. He'll use anything he can to win.

&gt;How the fuck is the ""West"" supposed to do that?! You somehow have a very strange imagination. If the ""West"" could take down people, then Rama, Vucic, Dodik, Dacic, Brnabic, Basha, Izetbegovic, Milo, Thaci, Haradinaj, would all be history. Gruevski ffs is in Hungary right now! A EU member!

Most of people you listed suck them off. Either way, if he was really trouble they could absolutely pull some wright behind his opposition. No doubt they played a role in Vučić coming to power.

&gt;Milo can't play a Vucic, because he doesn't have the same power (complete control of PinkTV, etc.)

The average car stands around 95% of the time and only carries 1.5 persons per trip.

With a self driving car you can have taxis that drive 24/7, only drive back into a battery to recharge or during low traffic hours, but otherwise they will be on the road constantly, are called with an app and bring you to your target.

In a scenario like that, personal transportation will be more of a cost factor than using a system like that which minimizes the costs per trip (after all, every time you don't use your car is wasted money as you pay your vehicle tax anyways).

This would likely reduce personal vehicle ownership, which would reduce traffic in the inner cities, which would decrease congestion, which would allow city planners to work with smaller roads and design cities more around bikes and walking.

They had their chance to show to the Czechs that they were a solid part of the country, instead, they actively worked to destroy Czechoslovakia from within. They did not want to be a part of the country and wanted to take the land with them to Germany, but we could not give up the land, as it was strategically important. So they sided with the Nazis, not all of them, but between 80-90% of them voted for a Nazi-affiliated party. And they were the ones who committed ethnic cleansing first, after Munich agreement was implemented, they chased away all the Czechs and Jews from the Sudetenland to the inner part of the country.

I know, not all Germans were guilty of it, but only a very small minority stood up to them. Nevertheless, I don't think any of them deserved to die for it, or be raped or otherwise bodily harmed, especially not in an extra-judicial manner. The expulsion itself however was just understandable, the hatred between the two sides was so large, we could not just go back to co-existing.

And yes, a murder is a murder, it's bad, but an unprovoked murder is worse than a murder in revenge. The motivation is simply more understandable. You kill someone's family, that person will want to kill yours. It works the same way on the level of a society. This does not mean that such murders should not be prosecuted, but it's always harder to do that, because the society often resists that, the eye for an eye justice is strongly ingrained in the human mentality and if you put humans in a severe trauma, where they are a victim of an unprovoked and senseless aggression, they will find it really hard to view victims also on the other side, on the side of the aggressor.

4154,"The share pic says:

""In the Netherlands greenhouses are supplied by the Linde Group with CO2 via a pipeline from an offshore oil/gas rig. In tons! ... and you should pay a CO2 tax.. do you understand or do you sleep"".

Here is a link explaining this process by the Linde Group [https://www.the-linde-group.com/en/clean\_technology/clean\_technology\_portfolio/co2\_applications/greenhouse\_supply/index.html](https://www.the-linde-group.com/en/clean_technology/clean_technology_portfolio/co2_applications/greenhouse_supply/index.html)  


  
I guess the author tries to say that, other people are paying to get CO2, while in Germany there will probably come a CO2 tax in 2021. I have several problems with this statement:

1. The CO2 supplied via pipeline from an oil rig can obviously use existing infrastructure to get the CO2 on land, therefore using this technology to avoid CO2 emissions is an economical decision.
2. As the Netherlands also plans to introduce a CO2 tax, this makes sense for Linde to pay less.
3. Of course, instead of a CO2 tax we could also force all CO2 emitters to store their CO2 temporary locally (example in cars) or directly feed it into a pipeline system (example: home or coal-based power plant).   
I highly doubt that this will be cheaper than our CO2 tax. We would need to create the demand to store 800 000 000 tons of CO2 to cover the German CO2 emissions ([https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/indicator-greenhouse-gas-emissions](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/indicator-greenhouse-gas-emissions)) and we would need to set up the infrastructure (example: pipelines todo so) system.",,/r/europe/comments/dem2ok/_/f2woyuf/,niklaszantner,1570468391

Our readers drew our attention to the three days of hard work of the news portals of Győr, which are trying to eliminate opinions about the scandal of the mayor of Zsolt Borkai. Kisalföld.hu and the Győr Plusz Média Facebook page regularly receive readers' comments asking for clarification, the administrators of the portals make it almost invisible or simply delete comments. Because photos and videos leaked from the mayor are listened to by the local media, comments appear under articles that are completely independent of the case and are removed almost immediately.

Similarly, Zsolt Borkai's official Facebook page is constantly disappearing. However, many users are constantly trying. - Are you moderating a thousand what? I hope it's a hot change because it can be tiring. Stay deep inside your tongue! Wrote a commenter.

The local KDNP organization, on the other hand, seemed to respond on Facebook. “Those who have nothing to fear cannot be intimidated. Whoever is accountable will be accounted for independently of us. We cannot give up our faith, our goals, and our achievements because they say that one of us did or did. There is a lot of power in the community, ”they wrote on their site. They added: ""We protect what we have built up of our faith and the trust of others!"" You fake Christian Christians, to whom the Ten Commandments are not holy. Hypocritical KDNP - commented a commenter.

Photos of the gold medal Borkaai, including in the 1988 Seoul Olympics shooting, appeared on a previously unknown blog featuring the Mayor of Győr, in a seemingly confidential setting, with two young women dressed in polo, on a seagoing ship. The picture also shows an additional woman and another man, the latter of whom, according to the blog, and apparently Zoltán Rákosfalvy's lawyer from Győr. New footage was released over the weekend and a video was released by the anonymous accuser.

A Fidesz politician responded to the accusations in a statement on Friday: ""I view lies about my person as part of an opposition campaign circus to divert attention from the inadequacy of the Győr opposition."" On Saturday, he posted a family photo on Facebook, which he wrote: “We hold on. For Better or Worse.""

Tl;dr FIDESZ mayor of Győr had a party on a yacht with cocaine and whores on EU funds + taxpayers money. The girls has been identified and a short section of the video is on pornhub where it is clear that he was on the scene.

4284,"&gt; Tesla Inc.’s Model 3 has vaulted past the VW Polo to become the best-selling model in the Netherlands, making the country the manufacturer’s most important market in Europe.

&gt; The California-based carmaker sold 5,768 units of its most affordable sedan during September, an almost four-fold jump from August, according to Dutch motor traders association Bovag. Demand for the Model 3 also made Tesla the most popular car brand in the country for the month.

&gt; Tesla’s sales have rocketed in Europe since the automaker introduced the Model 3 in key markets such as the Netherlands, Norway and Germany, beginning in February. The car, which retails from 43,390 euros ($47,308) in Europe, has left competitors trailing with a range of 240 miles on a single charge. Deliveries of the VW’s ID.3, which is set to retail for less than 30,000 euros with a range of 205 miles, are due to start early next year.

&gt; In the Netherlands, uptake of purely electric vehicles has been spurred by tax incentives that can save drivers several hundreds of euros a month on leased vehicles, according to leasing firm ALD Automotive Netherlands.

&gt; Government plans to roll back some of those incentives as of next year have prompted buyers to order cars now, an ALD spokeswoman said, while the Model 3’s competitive driving range and pricing have also attracted demand.

&gt; For the year, VW’s namesake brand still leads new-car registrations at 36,449 vehicles, compared with total sales of 13,991 for Tesla.",,/r/europe/comments/dej2q1/teslas_model_3_draws_dutch_demand_becomes/f2vim6o/,bataneyelid,1570453111

4329,"Pure manipulation. First of all Mentzen is not a leader of the party Konfederacja, secondly he was explaining that you can't make a political campaign using soft phrases, he said it in context of 447 act, and he said it that a regular Pole does not understand what the act is about. The fact that we ought to pay for Polish Jews to Israel, doesn't have required narrative power, and that we have to rephrase it in simple words. ""We don't want Jews"" is totally out of context. Watch the quoted speech. Don't give me that bs from shady websites.

Secondly the anti-LGBT protest is nothing illegal, as long as I does not involve hate speech. It happens all over the world Britain (last week), France last year, German CDU chief is called miss homophobia, etc. The fact is: Podlasie is a strong Christian and Eastern Orthodoxy region. In fact I'm surprised that the scale of it was so small. It was similar to the anti-abortion protests which Christians also participate in. What's even more positive every case that involved hate speech (mostly Jagiellonia hools) and aggression was dealt by the authorities within days (you can find legit articles in the web).

Don't expect uneducated people from rural areas to suddenly go all gay, but it doesn't also mean that they victimize them.

For sure stupid posters displayed during the pro LGBT marches such as the Virgin Mary shaped vagina, won't help to find a dialogue with the christian Poles. Personally for me it was more offensive than the good ol ""fuck gays"" sang by Polish hools. Because I know it happens every single football match. They fuck someone at least once week in their football chants. It just depends who is in the opposite team.

Thirdly, Robert Biedroń. You said about Konfederacja getting 7% in polls and yet they never won a single election. I say Robert Biedroń, whom got 3 mandates to the EU Parliament last year beating Konfederacja.

Last but not least. Poland is a country with an openly gay and trans parliament representative since 2011. It's 2019 what else do you need? Your whining reminds me Hanna's Gadsby's stand up show on Netflix. 

PS. Don't forget it's Poland. You could organize a cat lovers march and you would have the dog lovers fighting you.

&gt;Last week, a blog called Devil's Lawyer started publishing photos of Zsolt Borkai, Mayor of Győr, Fidesz. In the first photos, the mayor is sitting on a ship with young women, and the accompanying text is about corruption, prostitutes and cocaine. Borkai said Friday that the accusations were false and that the opposition was seeking to distract him from his own inadequacy.

&gt;New photos and a video were added to the blog this weekend, showing that the mayor was having a sex party. In response, Borkai posted a photo of his family on his Facebook page with the words ""We hold on to good, bad"".

&gt;The video of Borka during sex was uploaded to one of the biggest online porn sites by an unknown author on the blog and, unlike earlier images, the faces of the women attending the party are not obscured. During the video, they were identified in a comment within hours.

&gt;According to the names published on the porn site, one of the women filmed on board seems to have won EU money in 2017 to set up an event organizer in the Operational Program for Economic Development and Innovation for a total of HUF 3 million. TV2 also announced the winning bid and the business at the beginning of 2018 in its 'Women in Chance' development policy program.

&gt;By Monday morning, all three girls in the video and identified on the porn site had deleted their public images and posts from social media sites that were still available on Sunday afternoon.",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/dej6mh/a_comment_on_a_porn_site_identified_women/f2vjyoe/,boxs_of_kittens,1570453668

On the contrary, just take a afternoon walk at Ursynow, near KEN, see the greean areas, playgrounds and public spaces. Of course, the buildings are mostly utter shit made of concrete prefabricated elements, but the space is of nice quality, and people enjoy it.   
What I'm saying is not that communist urban planning was good.

I'm sorry, but that's not what happened in China. Yes, there were many people killed, but they were not killed by Mao. 

Mao refused to have a Soviet-style NKVD that would imprison and kill the bourgeois. He said that each village should put the local feudal lord on trial and decide what to do with them. The village would democratically decide what the punishment (if any) to be inflicted on the local landlord. It was all a local affair, with the result depending on the local relations in the village. Most of them were sentenced to death and executed, but this was all done directly by the people, not by a secret police.

Greece was used as the tool of the allies at first, and then when it served their interests they abandoned it. Also under the new leadership most of the veteran and experienced officers in the greek army were culled because they were Venizelists. That on top of the fact that the Turkish army started getting organized and also received some material help from the Soviets (and i think the Italians that were not happy about Smyrna being given to Greece), turned the Greek offense to a rout.

Well, federalisation would be nice but I'm more thinking of improving the current decision making process rather than adding more competences by making Parliament the main legislative entity (and maybe replacing the Council by a directly elected Senate). In any case, we need to decrease the influence of the national governments in the European legislative process. (Also we should probably give legislative initiative to Parliament).

&gt;The only real thing I can think of it is making the Eurogroup  accountable to the EP. It was unacceptable that the EP was side-lined  during the whole Greece issue.

That may be interesting but that would mean having non-Euro members decide over European monetary policy, not something we can really accept. There were talks of creating a Parliament for the Eurogroup but, as far as I know, it didn't go anywhere. A solution could be to only have the Euro-members MEPs seat in the Euro focused sessions (but it would probably require the President of the Parliament to be from an Euro-member or to have a separate President for those sessions).

Some also want the ECB to be dependent from the governments but that's not a good idea. The idea of the ECB (and a lot of Central Banks), is to have it independent to avoid any temptation of potentially disastrous governmental intervention on currencies.

&gt;I think the biggest change needed is people need a more realistic idea  of what the EU is capable of. If there is no agreement to do something  at EU level, then perhaps it shouldn't happen at EU level. Subsidiarity  is a thing, and the vast majority of issues you have in daily life are  your own governments responsibility.

That's not what subsidiarity is. Subsidiarity says that each subject should be addressed at the ideal level for that subject. For example, lower education doesn't need EU management, except, maybe, for standards for secondary education diploma (to ease enrolment in other countries university) and EU wide programs like Erasmus. On the other hand, EU involvement is a good thing: energy production could greatly benefit from Europeanized management, transport does in order to create large European networks (with local networks left to countries and regions), environmental policies also somewhat benefit from the EU as well as market regulations. Some things, like the GDPR, the standardisation of Micro USB-B on phones, the removal of mobile data roaming across EU countries or the increased consumer protection for airline clients would likely not have been possible without the sheer weight of the EU.

Of course, if the EU proves unable to reach an agreement on a specific subject, EU states can (and sometimes should) act on their own but that doesn't mean they are the best placed to do so, only that the EU nations could not reach a compromise which is often enough to block a legislation.

&gt;Other than that, everything that the EU is actually responsible for  works with QMV, and that seems to work pretty well in practice.

The Council can indeed work using QMV but in practice it often does not. It seems the Council often chooses not to vote if unanimity or near unanimity isn't achieved.","Belgium, Benelux, EU",/r/europe/comments/dcwi9v/president_sassoli_tusk_and_juncker_as_well_as/f2v56aa/,loicvanderwiel,1570446136

4428," The Provisional Government was on a government in name only, the real functions of the state were increasingly controlled by the Soviets, who were directly elected by the workers while the Duma was elected only by landowners of the russian empire. The liberals who controlled the Duma did not dispute the legitimacy of Soviet organisation, and indeed had their own representation in the Soviets, but when it became clear that the working class population would prefer soviet power the Duma saw fit to massacre them in the street. Weeks later the same government had to rely on the soviets to defend itself against a Coup d'etat. After proving both it's disdain for and weakness against the Soviets, revolution was inevitable.

TL;DR do not massacre the house of government that controls the railways, factories, and an ever increasing proportion of the army as you fail to leave WWI if you don't want to have a revolution. if you believe any revolution can be legitimate on its own merits, rather then because it appeals to your ideological orientation, then the bolshevik revolution was as ''legitimate' as any,",,/r/europe/comments/de44h3/photo_of_tsar_nicholas_iis_opening_speech_before/f2v5c2k/,BujwaZ,1570446273

We'll just have to wait for the full unmodified data on the trajectory of the drone. I'm sure the US will totally release that.

ah fuck. At least they're super sure they never entered Iranian airspace right?

&gt; But a senior Trump administration official said there was concern inside the United States government about whether the drone, or another American surveillance aircraft, or even the P-8A manned aircraft flown by a military aircrew, actually did violate Iranian airspace at some point. The official said the doubt was one of the reasons Mr. Trump called off the strike.

4487,"The (former collectivized) agriculture in east Germany is now way more efficient than in west Germany. Most of the collectives switched to a modern legal form instead of diving the land up. The collective farms in Germany (LPG) were a bad idea, but not because of the idea itself, but the implementation. Bloated responsibilities and old techniques increased the necessary manpower needed to 5.5 persons per ha (not sure if it’s a German measurement, 10.000 m^2). After the reunification a personell reduction up to 90% was possible. Today they are very competitive and quite the success story.


But I am not sure how other communist states handled the collectivization. In east Germany there was a very important difference between collectivized factories and collectivized farmland. The factories were translated into legal state-ownership, but the farmland were not! The farmland actually transitioned into independent co-ownership (cooperative organization). This made the transition into the free market straightforward. Nearly every LPG transitioned into a modern legal form and is now more similar to small to midsized agricultural businesses with co-ownership model.",,/r/europe/comments/de83zb/soviet_collectivization_belarus_right_vs_no/f2v09zc/,LeanderKu,1570438790

The collective farms after the fall of the GDR stayed, only organized in private corporations now which they use to e.g. share farming equipment such as trucks or silos.

And now from what I heard this measure may not increase production by much, but VASTLY decreases costs for any individual farmer. ""Economies of Scale"" can work better in that system or meaning: the more you produce of something the cheaper the ""per unit"" price becomes. Which in return makes these farms more profitable. All any individual farmer needs to take care of is to grow and collect his crops, the business end is handled by the company and the farmer will get the share of the profits.

Compare that to e.g. Bavaria where every farmer has their own farm and is completely left to their own devices. They have to buy (or more likely lease/rent) every vehicle even if they use it maybe only once a year. Need to maintain it by themselves. They need their own silos and need to take care of the business end all by themselves (crops don't sell themselves after all).

Yes, conflict. Remember Galileo? He was prosecuted by the Church and its intolerant dogmatics. The West gained freedom of speech precisely because it removed the shackles of the church.

4761,"&gt; From 2004 to 2019, NATO has added the following countries to its membership: Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

-

&gt; It is actually mind-boggling that the leadership of the West is blind to the history of Russia, specifically the history of the Rapallo Treaty of 1922 and the Non-Aggression Treaty with Nazi Germany of 1939.

I'm reasonably confident that Poland, at least, is aware of the Non-Aggression Treaty, and I don't really see that as an argument that Russia should be given a military free hand in Eastern Europe.

The author's argument is predicated on the idea that Russia is entitled to control Eastern Europe in the name of protecting itself from a hypothetical rapid land attack from the west.  Let me ask him a few questions:

* Why is Russia entitled to such a protective sphere, but the countries that he proposes to turn over to Russia not?  I can only assume that this is a ""might makes right"" argument, that Russia must be afforded such a thing because it is a large military power...but if *that* is the argument, then Russia is vastly weaker than NATO.

* What relevance does historic warfare have here?  These countries are not relevant in the case of nuclear war.  In a conventional war, I claim that Russia (a) will lose an air war with NATO, and (b) having lost such an air war, cannot ultimately prevail on the land, and that this is true regardless of whether those countries are under Russian control or not.  I have a hard time dreaming up a scenario in which Russia controlling Ukraine or Estonia would materially change the realities here.

* The interest those countries have in being in NATO is to neutralize Russia's ability to use Russian military power against them; if Russia will not, they have no reason to be in NATO.  Russia could equally eliminate the concern via convincingly selling the idea that she will not use military force against those countries...something that her recent actions have not done a fantastic job of.  It seems curious to me that one should have the idea that Russia should be entitled to use hard power against countries in Eastern Europe.

    Those countries were not forced into NATO.  They chose to enter NATO and choose to remain in NATO specifically because of their beliefs about what Russia would do.  And Russia is the greatest factor in determining that.

&gt; From a perspective of world politics and strategic analysis, China with its blatant theft of intellectual property rights, its military aggression in the South China Sea and its Belt and Road Initiative is the most dangerous threat to the current world order. If China is to be successfully countered without the use of organized military violence, then the West needs to come to a political solution to the current hostility between the West and Russia.

Not compelling.

Russia is a weaker player caught between more-powerful entities in Eurasia -- the EU, China, and probably soon India.  Her reaction is to try to do exactly what every weaker country stuck between more-powerful entities is -- to play them off against each other, to always claim that she will side with the other if one doesn't do what she wants.  We stopped playing games like that back with Nasser.  If Russia wants to go to China, that's her decision, and to her the costs and benefits.  Russia has claimed that she is afraid of being invaded by the West and that the remedy for this is giving her control over countries in Eastern Europe, lest she side with China.  While doing this, she's been [trying to resettle people in areas bordering China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Homestead_Act) -- an action one takes when one is worried about maintaining control of territory -- not moving people to the western borders.  This is not very convincing if one is attempting to argue that the Kremlin is in dire fear of Latvia or whoever seeking *lebensraum*.

The author seems to think that we should give Russia control of Eastern Europe for some sort of hypothetical Russian support (of what value or reliability this support might be I am unsure) against China.  Even if one assumed that that were a reasonable position and treated the position of Eastern Europeans in the matter as irrelevant, what would be at stake is not just those countries, but our credibility.

IP rights are completely irrelevant to this matter other than in being a point of friction between China and the US (and probably the EU, though I don't know what the history is there).  I also strongly suspect that China's interest in enforcing IP rights will be tied to the degree to which China herself produces IP.  As I've pointed out before, the United States used to take a fairly cavalier position as to violating European copyrights; once the US was producing a good deal of IP herself and finding [it being violated](https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/newsletter/inventors-eye/mark-twains-copyright-fight), the international enforcement of IP became a pressing issue.

For that matter, Russia -- herself hardly a paragon of respecting IP rights -- seems like an odd country to enlist in encouraging enforcement of IP rights in China.

&gt;Only this way, can the world avoid a clash of arms between the West and China, which is aided and supported by an estranged Russia.

In the long run, military power is bounded by economic power.  I suspect that Russia is not particularly relevant in the question of whether there is a clash of arms with China and not particularly relevant in the question of who would prevail in such a conflict.

&gt; Similarly, the historical record suggests that there is a very clear connection *in the long run* between an individual Great Power's economic rise and fall and its growth and decline as an important military power (or world empire).  This, too, is hardly surprising, since it flows from two related facts.  The first is that economic resources are necessary to support a large-scale military establishment.  The second is that, so far as the international system is concerned, both wealth and power are always *relative* and should be seen as such.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/dea2gt/the_west_needs_to_seek_an_accommodation_with/f2uhxtr/,vokegaf,1570417020

4763,"It means that there mostly no longer are any 'single Belarusian farmers'. The traditional land ownership model where each owner, who lives in a nearby village, cultivates their private strip of land (left picture) was replaced by a system (right picture) where these strips are united into larger fields, and these are then given to the local agricultural 'collective', a semi-nationalised organization made of mostly the former private owners (who had no choice but to join it). 

In Czechia, where the same development happened, after the fall of communism these large fields were mostly privatized, leading to the unfortunate creation of huge land owning corporations who have no relationship to the land whatsoever and just use it as a temporary resource to make a quick buck. I don't know if they were privatized in Belarus the same way or if the socialist agro-collectives still exist there.",Boleslav did nothing wrong,/r/europe/comments/de83zb/soviet_collectivization_belarus_right_vs_no/f2ui0rn/,a-sentient-slav,1570417080
4764,"I realise that my comment can be interpreted as an idea that I don't actually subscribe to. My ending notes were more meant as a wonder: ""How different would it be?"" rather than believing that it would be that different. No Hitler probably wouldn't mean no European part of WW2, but there's a good chance it doesn't result in the Holocaust. And no Stalin probably wouldn't result in no war against the Finns and later Poland and Germany, and the rather aggressive expansion of the Soviet Union, but there's a good chance it would result in much fewer people going to the Gulags. The evidence lies in how many of the most extreme hardline policies were repealed under Khrushchev.

&gt; I always had the impression that wars like that wouldn't really be ""solved"" by removing one person.

This is absolutely correct, although it is greatly debated among historians how much of an impact individuals have. A hundred years ago and the historians would've answered that they're the most important part. 30-40 years ago and they would've said essentially no impact. Modern historians are somewhere in the middle and much less clear about it. And for good reason because it's honestly impossible to say for sure.

&gt; I really doubt you would stop the Great War by stopping Gavrilo Princip.

Princip was the spark that ignited the fire, but there had been other sparks earlier that didn't ignite it, and if not for Princip, there would've been a later spark. Pre-WW1 Europe was simply too much of a timebomb to not go off at some point. Imperialism is like that.

&gt; Post-WW1 feelings of humiliation and disappointment and resentment in German society that were used by Hitler would still be there, and who knows how they would manifest without him.

Spot on. We'll never know. Quite likely war as it's a general policy, but less likely Holocaust as it's much more specific. But being more specific than that? Yeah, it's impossible.

&gt; And ideology that ""created"" Stalin wouldn't disappear with his death. Lenin was really cruel as well

I must admit, my knowledge on the Bolshevik is really shaky at best. But I do know more about Stalin specifically because of personal interest, and the sources are not kind when they refer to his personality with some suggesting he could've been sociopathic. Soviet colonel general Dmitri Volkogonov refers to him as a man without compassion. Volkogonov certainly doesn't go easy on Lenin though, and other historians treat the Bolsheviks in general in the same light. But there is quite a lot of evidence to suggest that Stalin was especially cruel, from Volkogonov's comments to how he treated his son, to his reign of terror, his paranoid grasp to power. I'd say in all ways except ideologically a more cruel man than Hitler.

I noticed that especially on social media that Turks are constantly getting demonised around issues regarding Kurds and Armenians, I'm not going to deeper on these subjects. Ataturk was not only a great statesman also a great military leader who defeated the Greek army in October 1922 who had the latest modern weaponry and was supported by most allied countries. If we speak of the state of the Turkish army at that period it was a army made out of volunteers, militia and former Ottoman soldiers while the Greek army was more professional and better organised and even had an air force. Despite all these disadvantages he defeated the Greeks and forced the allied forces to retreat and path the way to the Kemalist Army to take whole Turkey. Ataturk envisioned a European style Turkey that's why he adopted many Western policies and state structures, he looked upon the west and looked down to the east.

In Turkey you need to be rich/educated/secular or poor/Islamist or left wing/Kurdish to succeed with the voters. Erdogan pretends to be poor and Islamist to win. I’m sure you’re not naive enough to think that politicians are sincere. 

You can say he has fanned divisive rhetoric you can say he has said Islamist things but you cannot in full honestly say that he has changed/overturned ataturks reforms. He has not done that. If you believe he is secretly an Islamist and wants to enact shariah law that’s your opinion but he hasn’t actually done it and I don’t think he wants to either — he enjoys himself too much and his party is full of MPs who are living a “secular” lifestyle.

The far right party is itself officially secularist and traced to ataturk (through a faction of the CHP) so they identify as Kemalist. Maybe this is surprising to you but Kemal Ataturk was a nationalist. 

In all honesty the issue of secularism is settled in Turkey the topic pops up because it represents live fault lines in socioeconomic divisions of wealth and it makes people upset /triggered but that’s about it. Tell the rich urban liberals that secularism is threatened and they show up to vote... tell the rural townspeople and shopkeeps that they are turning mosques into stables and they show up to vote... meanwhile nothing tangible changes in the institutions. The major “Islamist victories” were to allow female Muslim students to attend university while wearing headscarves and to allow for voluntary specialized high schools for religious education (which are under attended); it used to be illegal to show religious affiliation in schools but now it’s not.

&gt; Negotiations for the pact began January 1, 1984, and concluded February 1, 1985. The pact was signed on April 22, 1985. Implementing legislation was introduced into the U.S. Congress on April 29 by Rep. James C. Wright, Jr. (D–Texas). This legislation was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives on May 7 by a 422–0 vote, and by the U.S. Senate on May 23 by a voice vote. The pact was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan on June 11, and implemented on September 1.

(Start of negotiations June 6, 2000).

&gt; The U.S. House of Representatives ratified the FTA on 31 July 2001 and the U.S. Senate ratified it on 7 December 2001; both were by voice vote, an indication of its widespread support. Former President George W. Bush signed the United States–Jordan Free Trade Area Implementation Act into law on 28 September 2001.[2] It was implemented by both countries on 17 December 2001. 

**18 months.**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia%E2%80%93United_States_Free_Trade_Agreement

&gt; Negotiations for the FTA began in March 2003 and after six rounds of negotiations held in Canberra, Hawaii and Washington, D.C., the text was finally agreed to in February 2004, and signed off on by Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick in Washington in May 2004.
&gt;
&gt; The FTA was ratified by the United States Congress with the passage of the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. It was passed by the House of Representatives on 14 July 2004 by a vote of 314–109 and by the Senate on 15 July 2004 by a vote of 80–16,[2] and signed into law by President George W. Bush on 3 August 2004.[3]
&gt;
&gt; In Australia, the agreement's implementing legislation, the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act 2004, was reluctantly passed, with amendments, by the Senate on 13 August 2004. After some delay, the U.S. Administration accepted the amended Australian legislation as being consistent with implementation of the agreement.[citation needed]
&gt;
&gt;The Agreement came into force in both countries on 1 January 2005.

4884,"**1 (top left) - Victor Hugo :**  Victor Marie Hugo (26 February 1802 –  22 May 1885) was a French poet,  playwright, novelist, statesman and  human rights activist. He played an  important part in the Romantic  movement in France.  Hugo first became famous in France because of his  poetry, as well as his  novels and his plays. Les Contemplations and La  Légende des siècles are  his most famous poetry collections.

**2 (top right) - Gustave Eiffel :**  Alexandre Gustave Eiffel       - 5 December 1832 – 27 December 1923) was a French civil engineer.  A      graduate of École Centrale Paris, he made his name building  various      bridges for the French railway network, most famously the  Garabit      viaduct. He is best known for the world-famous Eiffel  Tower, built  for     the 1889 Universal Exposition in Paris, and his  contribution to    building   the Statue of Liberty in New York. After  his retirement  from     engineering, Eiffel focused on research into  meteorology and      aerodynamics, making significant contributions in  both fields. 

**3 (bottom left) - Jules Verne  :**  Jules Verne, born February 8, 1828 in  Nantes and died March 24, 1905 in Amiens, is a French writer whose work  is, for the most part, consisting of adventure novels evoking the  scientific progress of the nineteenth century.

The  novels of Jules Verne, always very well documented, generally take  place during the second half of the 19th century. They take into account  the technologies of the time - The Children of Captain Grant (1868),  The Around the World in Eighty Days (1873), Michael Strogoff (1876), The  Star of the South (1884), etc. - but also others not yet mastered or  more fanciful - From Earth to the Moon (1865), Twenty Thousand Leagues  Under the Sea (1870), Robur the Conqueror (1886), etc.

**4 (bottom left) - Louis Pasteur :**   Born December 27, 1822 in Dole, France, Louis Pasteur discovered that   microbes were responsible for the acidification of alcohol. His work on   germ theory also led him and his team to develop vaccines against   anthrax and rabies.

We are just dying out! Why is everyone silent about this ?!

Do you know that the population of most European countries will be halved by 2060-2070?

That is why Europe is forced to import these refugees. I don’t know what politicians in Europe talk about the true causes of migration, but if they tell the truth, I’m not surprised why Britain wants to leave the EU. By the fact that, in fact, due to migrants from a completely different culture and ethnic origin, the European population is being replaced.

By 2060, whites in the United States will become a minority, and I will not be surprised that in the United States, Spanish will become the official language. But they will in any case have a positive population growth. You do not just have to blame me for racism.

5072,"I posted this a while back....hope it’s not to late. 

Here’s his route through and what he’s got in mind.

He’ll ask for an extension, one (or more) EU member states will refuse (unanimity is required) and we will go out by default. He probably already knows who is onside for this.

Parliament forgot to cover this off.

At that point, in order to avoid a calamitous no-deal Brexit if the EU refuse an extension, Britain can serve a notice rescinding Teresa May’s Article 50 notice. This would stop the whole process, it would give time for elections to be held and if necessary a second referendum. The European Court have already ruled that Britain has the power to do so (with certain conditions).

However Parliament didn’t legislate for this possibility. It was probably assumed that the EU would not refuse an extension after all they don’t want to be the authors of us crashing out .

Boris won’t serve that notice and and as things stand he’s not obliged to by law. He’s only obliged to ask for the extension.

Even if parliament can get back in time to plug the loophole Boris is undoubtedly looking to go through and require him to take “all necessary steps” to prevent a no-deal Brexit, including a notice of recision, given what he’s been saying here’s a very strong risk he won’t. Or will do it in a way which doesn’t comply with the Court’s conditions.

The only thing to do then is to take away his pen. The votes are there to do so in Parliament. The question is whether there’s enough time.

Boris and Farage were already whispering in Continental ears to not grant the last extension and France has made some worrying noises already.

Parliament need to act very quickly.

To our European friends can I just say this. When you hear Boris Johnson talking about the “will of the people”  it’s not like that at all. Here’s a fact which we need you to know:

62% OF THE UK ELECTORATE HAVE NOT VOTED TO LEAVE THE EU.

As a matter of fact, it's very predictable as it has huge inertness in time, graphs show echoes of ww2 even today. Isac Asimov wrote about psychohistory. Check it out on the wiki.

5201,"&gt;Ottomanist and liberal plans for regional rights, minority rights and more democracy is certainly an oucome that would ""make the cut"". Dismissing this just because Kemalists won is nonsense.

You are assuming that they could have the political power necessary to do any of this. The world had removed the rug from under them long ago. The Kemalists (more accurately: the national movement) didn't just *win*, they halted a century-long string of territory loss and defeat which gave what would become the CHP the chance (in the form of political trust and just plain old power) to build a new country and society. Damat Ferit (and his periphery) were not of the right background or class to achieve this feat and to call their project itself achievable comes with untold assumptions, chief among which is the question of how to not be a dissected colony.

&gt; Never said Kemalism was a precursor to Nazism. I said Kemal's policies in regards to minorities were admired by Hitler. Ultranationalists liking ultranationalists shouldn't be news. 

Thing is, you're taking a general principle like ""ultranationalists liking ultranationalists"" yet at the same time claiming that there is something special between these two specifically because of ethnic cleansing. Ihrig himself doesn't say this, the more important factor was a sense of shared experience and Turkey's successful rejection of Allied impositions.

Hitler no doubt would have also liked Greece's or Bulgaria's ethnic cleansing. The stories of ex-Ottoman states usually differ only in degree when it comes to how they became ethnically homogeneous blobs. Except for Yugoslavia ofc.

&gt;Coups denying social crises in such a fascistic notion. And for people like me who are interested in liberal ideals and democracy in Turkey praising such totalitarian notions is dangerous. Turkey is afraid of democratic rule and changes.

Those were never considered seriously. As soon as the Young Turks came to power they backtracked on the liberal reforms that they initially advocated for. by 1908, the Ottoman Empire was falling apart and no amount of reforms could have saved it.

&gt;I said Kemal's policies in regards to minorities were admired by Hitler. Ultranationalists liking ultranationalists shouldn't be news.

Hitler also praised Andrew Johnson for ethnically cleansing the native Americans from the mid-west. So what?

That doesn't mean that the connection is significant to make serious accusations.

&gt;And for people like me who are interested in liberal ideals and democracy in Turkey praising such totalitarian notions is dangerous.

But Mustafal Kemal isn't praised for his authoritarianism but for modernizing the country and finally transitioning from an islamist feudal monarchy into a westernized, secular Republic.

Also stomping on minorities by confiscating properties, forcing name changes, prohibiting foreign languages, extreme taxation, pogroms etc. Not even close to ""civic"". It may not be racists in terms of race but it is ultranationalist in terms of national conversion via brutal force. 

&gt; Yes Kemalist coups did happen,but the people of Turkey were expected to uphold the Kemalist principles first 

The quote you give means nothing if it is not implented institutionaly. It is just political talk. You shouldn't fall for that. 

&gt;Damat Ferit betrayed his country by fighting against the National Movement 

He just had a different vision. Liberal, european, tolerant. Not forced conversions, nationalism and militarism. And ever since the cult of kemalism won his vision was portaited as betrayal. Noting that talk of betrayal is the bread and butter of nationalists. 

&gt;Hitler saying good things about Atatürk doesnt make him a Nazi. A wide group of people including Barack Obama, Charles de Gaulle,David Lloyd George,Aristide Briand,Dwight Eisenhower, Amanullah Khan (King of Afghanistan), John F.Kennedy,Nikita Khrushchev,Vladimir Lenin have praised Atatürk,does that mean he follows the ideologies of these men which are diverse,and in many cases,conflicting? Even the Greek President Eleftherios Venizelos praised the guy for God's sake!

The figures you give praised him for things other than the things Hitler admired. Him doing a bunch of good secular policies doesn't erase the fact that he was a brutal dictator who didn't tolerate opposition, denied the rights of minorities and set up fake trials to execute non-Turks.

5221,"So the only thing you have is an argumentum ad hominem against Irving? And a straw-man ""We are not talking about a demilitarised free-city here"". Come on.

We have quotations from the British military. The Chief of the Air Staff said that 

""We should use available effort in one big attack on Berlin and attacks on Dresden, Leipzig, and Chemnitz, or any other cities where a severe blitz will not only cause confusion in the evacuation from the East, but will also hamper the movement of troops from the West""

So we do have one legitimate reason, stopping reinforcements to reach the Eastern front. But to bomb the city centre? We have Taylor saying that

""British historian Frederick Taylor mentions a further memo sent to the Chiefs of Staff Committee by Sir Douglas Evill on 1 February, in which Evill states interfering with mass civilian movements was a major, even key, factor in the decision to bomb the city centre.""

Well, that sounds like pure evil. We also have the RAF memo saying that: 

""Dresden, the seventh largest city in Germany and not much smaller than Manchester is also the largest unbombed builtup area the enemy has got. In the midst of winter with refugees pouring westward and troops to be rested, roofs are at a premium, not only to give shelter to workers, refugees, and troops alike, but to house the administrative services displaced from other areas. At one time well known for its china, Dresden has developed into an industrial city of first-class importance ... The intentions of the attack are to hit the enemy where he will feel it most, behind an already partially collapsed front ... and incidentally to show the Russians when they arrive what Bomber Command can do.""

Great, so the idea was to leave civilians without a roof.

We also have a RAF commander saying that

""coordinated air attack by the RAF to aid the current Soviet offensive would have a detrimental effect on German morale.""

5234,"&gt; I have you tagged as ""better check his sources."" So I followed my own advice.

Not really. You've made the classic mistake people who google shit without either understanding what they're reading **OR BOTHERING TO READ EVERYTHING IN THE RESULT** do.


Congratulations, you've found the maximum number of hours we can DRIVE a day. However driving isn't all we do. 

&gt; The 13 hour day claim is bullshit

No it isn't. Try reading the section you didn't get to about daily and weekly rest **WHICH IS THE VERY NEXT LINE UNDER THE ONE YOU QUOTED** ROFLMAO.

[From your own link](https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/road/social_provisions/driving_time_en) on the line directly under the one you quoted above:

&gt; * Daily rest period shall be at least 11 hours, with an exception of going down to 9 hours maximum three times a week. Daily rest can be split into 3 hours rest followed by 9 hour rest to make a total of 12 hours daily rest
&gt; 
&gt; * Weekly rest is 45 continuous hours, which can be reduced every second week to 24 hours. Compensation arrangements apply for reduced weekly rest period. Weekly rest is to be taken after six days of working

Or for a simplified version from UK.gov:

&gt; **Breaks and Rest** 
&gt; 
&gt;  The main points of EU rules on breaks and rest are that you must take:
&gt; 
&gt; * at least 11 hours rest every day - you can reduce this to 9 hours rest 3 times between any 2 weekly rest periods
&gt; 
&gt; * an unbroken rest period of 45 hours every week - you can reduce this to 24 hours every other week


Daily rest is 11hrs which may be reduced to 9hrs three times a week. What is 24-11 and 24-9? Oh wait, its 13 and 15. So we can have a duty period every day of 13hrs which can be extended to 15hrs three times a week.

&gt; and the claim about 84 hours a week.

You can work a maximum of 6 duty periods between weekly rests, three full daily rests and three reduced daily rests. So that's 3x13hr duty periods plus 3x15hr duty periods. 39+45=84.

&gt; I can't find any source about the 11h week previous to the EU directives, but please provide your sources.

5258,"Oooh boy, here we go.

European teachnological advancement is due to several factors compared to Africa.

The most important factor in my opinion, is that the continent has the perfect geography to allow technological advances to spread (and adapt), but not too open to encourage unification or people (which helps encourage unification of people)

Let's break it down a bit further. The most obvious thing when you look at Europe is that a) it's a load of peninsulas/islands and b) it runs parralel to the equator.

The peninsulas help contribute to the nation building to a point, and then stifle it once it has reached those natural barriers. This promotes decently sized nation states which are easy to defend and hard to take, stabilizing countries which otherwise wouldn't normally exist.

Running parralel to the equator helps a *lot* with technological exchange, as crops that are raised in the middle east require (comparatively) small amounts of adaptions to fit the small variations in climate.

You also have the fact that humans grew up in Africa, so the wildlife adapted to people, keeping up the dangerous wildlife. There are no lions, tigers or large beasts, as humans in Europe already had (comparatively) modern tools by the time they got there, and wiped out wildlife before they could adapt.

Compare this to the Geography in Africa, which has the largest desert, then a jungle. The technology is completely non-compatible. 

There are much fewer natural borders, and faaaar more habitats that have a high variance.


The sad thing is that your argument does hold weight against a certain region or two (on the surface), but you just say ""hey, Africa is poor, must be because of their culture, right?""",,/r/europe/comments/ddu81w/how_many_people_agree_with_the_statement_our/f2sa8nn/,Lemon__Limes,1570380811

5287,"&gt;I can understand the sentiment, but you gotta realise the Bolsheviks' historic mission was to lift Russia out of the middle ages, not to idolize some agricultural commune.

I understand that, but just because their ideology permits coup (disputable) it doesn't make it legal or right. And there is also a contradiction here - the only part of Russia that was lagging behind in overall development was peasantry. Russian western cities in 1917 by all means were industrialized and developed. The peasants needed to be lifted out from their absolute poverty and near feudal style of living, but not in the way Bolsheviks imagined and certainly not by the methods Bolsheviks employed. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;	Even though the SRs were overruled, piece was made with the peasantry in the NEP and the land reform, and it's not like Lenin opposed farmer cooperatives:

I would hardly call mass famines, forced food requisitions, terror for the sake of terror and conscription as making peace with the peasantry. Not to mention what happened in 1930's under Stalin, especially in Ukraine...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I still don't think it's a coup when so many millions of workers and peasants stood behind the Bolsheviks. **A coup implies a small elite seizing power in a palace revolution.** The same way Ayatollah Khomneni's Iranian Revolution wasn't a coup, because millions of people supported him over the Schah, no matter what one thinks about the outcome.

I boldened the text so you know what I am replying to. The workers didn't get any more power from the coup than they had before it. The coup just resulted in largely unrestricted power for Lenin and his friends.

The uprising had infuriated German leaders, who decided to make an example of the city, which they had long since selected for major reconstruction as part of their planned Germanization of Central Europe.

Even before the uprising, the Germans knew that, within a few months, Warsaw would fall into Allied hands. Despite that, they dedicated an unprecedented effort to destroying the city. Their decision tied up considerable resources which could have been used at the Eastern Front and at the newly-opened Western Front following the Normandy landings.

&gt;This is to put it very mildly, an outrageous lie, not to mention an insult to all Bulgarians who gave their lives to achieve a better future for Bulgaria.

And I'd like us to remember we make ministers resign and historians leave our country because it is impossible to fight the predominant historical status quo, built in nationalistic times to create a different identity than the previous Ottoman one. I feel like you haven't read up on the topic. Some historians claim that it was harder being a heretic in Catholic countries than a Christian in the Ottoman Empire and that is about the least liberal years of the Empire. Christians always had the right to religions autonomy. With the exception of Batak which again was done by Pomak irregulars (which does not absolve the Empire from some blame) you wouldn't be able to find any violence against Christians on an institutional scale. Biggest discrimination Christians faced was being unable to serve as witness in trials against Muslims. Which is a reason for independence but it doesn't make one not free. 

If being historically accurate insults anyone then it is their own damn fault. History seen through emotion is a very dangerous thing. When looking at the past, truthfulness should be our only goal. And the fact that you can't even raise this topic is a giant black spot for Bulgaria in our attempt at being a smarter and more capable nation and one we must overcome to achieve something more.",FedEU|Free Hong Kong,/r/europe/comments/ddpjkp/turkish_villager_praying_two_rakaat_before/f2rjngk/,20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,1570373689

&gt;You didn't show any facts. Any. Just some judgements of some journalists which likely weren't even there. Their judgements are not based on facts either.

Far-right and right groups made the basis of the protesters, I gave you three links to prove it.

I will make this easy - My argument is that majority of protesters in Ukraine against the peace plan are far-right, to prove that I already posted three links from good, well known sites that are even pro-Ukrainian. I could have easily found pro-Russian sites for this to bolster my argument, but I didn't because I am not pro-Russian.

You have not proved my argument wrong other than posting your personal opinion that the journalists of all three sites are bullshitting. I don't believe you, nor will any audience believe your claims unless you post give some tangible source to your claims. Can you do this?

5430,"&gt;They also didnt enslave their own people, while the Romans did, but I admit I was incorrect about slavery.

How saintly of them.

&gt;Marco Polo, a direct observer from the time period considered Mongol culture to be at least equal if not superior to Western European culture.

Interesting that now you admit the possibility of culture being ""at least equal"" (which permits the possibility of inferior cultures) or ""superior"" instead of just saying equal. Seems like Marco Polo could compare cultures, but I can't ? 

&gt;And religious toleration doesn't lead to the survival of the species? What are you talking about? Of course it does! Not killing the people around you for stupid reasons is generally a damn good thing.

It really doesn't. In fact we still have wars of religion. And we're still around.

&gt;Not too mention of course that the Roman conversion to Christianity pretty much single handedly stalled Western advancement for over a thousand years. Roman christian culture is Roman culture too. The only reason we discovered things that were lost for thousands of years was because the Romans fucked up enough to lose them in the first place.

Christian dark ages is a myth on reddit, nothing else , perpetuated by reddit pseudo-intellectual culture of elitism.

&gt;The majority of modern scholars avoid the term altogether due to its negative connotations, finding it misleading and inaccurate.[10][11][12] The pejorative meaning remains in use,[1][2][13] typically in popular culture which often mischaracterises the Middle Ages as a time of violence and backwardness.[14][15]

&gt;There are plenty of Mongol inventions that we still use today: dried milk, hand grenades, the composite bow was far superior to European models and used for hundreads of years, they widley adopted paper throughout the empire (more so even than the Chinese had) and helped spread it to Europe where it was unheard of. They had a postal system which put the Romans to shame. They invented standardized bank notes.

Hand grenades were made by china as is gunpowder. Dried milk the way we use it, russians. 

Composite bows were used by people at least 2000 years before Mongols even existed. Plenty of people.  You say it's superior, but that entirely depends on what you want to do with the bow. 

Paper is once again, a chinese invention. The fact that they adopted it more doesn't really matter.

&gt;So yes, I can say that Mongol culture was not inferior to Roman culture at all, and like I said direct observers of the time period agree.

Observer of what time period ? Marco Polo ? He lived 1000 of years after the peak of Roman culture. Observer of Roman culture time period ? He lived 1000 years before Mongols ever set foot outside Mongolia he didn't know about them. 

When you look at influence their respective cultures had on the world, you can not seriously suggest Mongol culture had the same influence as Roman one. I mean you can but no historian will take it seriously.

It's the same as me claiming that Serbian culture had the same influence on the world as French. It's ridiculous and I'd be a moron to suggest that. It'd make historians laugh.",🇮🇱 Израел 🇮🇱,/r/europe/comments/ddu81w/how_many_people_agree_with_the_statement_our/f2rnal9/,ahwhatever11,1570374616

In almost every poll about the influence of France abroad, people tend to regret that this influence is diminishing and that we are less and less of a world power by the day.

Rather most people believe that the EU offers the best proxy there can be to channel and improve the status of France worldwide, or at least prevent its decline.

&gt;The obvious fact that capitulation will make angry literally everyone (except of separatists) and will cause huge protests among all thee

Where did you get the idea that the peace talks are capitulation? Nothing has even been decided yet and there is no information about the points to be discussed. This ""capitulation"" idea just reeks of far-right sentiment.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Propagandists call rights (which we have a lot) ultra-rights (which we have a few). That is highly manipulative but still popular tactics.

Yes, but by far-right I mean only meant far-right groups. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The fact that real ultra-right may participate any massive event, doesn't make this event ""their"" and doesn't tell anything about the majority of protesters.

If the vocal majority of protesters are far-right, it is by definition ""their"" protest. 

&amp;#x200B;

Or a wheel. So much for a complex society that can't invent a wheel.

&gt; That was the Mayans, and that was *long* before European contact.

There was three or four ""civilizations"" who ignited and burned out in three or four centuries each one after another. And it was because of deforestation for senseless buildings, or because of plagues, or because they exploited and massacred everyone to the point they had no allies when Europeans appeared. But we must somehow believe that the last one died only because Spaniards arrived and without their appearance it would blossom and not vanish in a next 50-100 years.

&gt; And I shouldn't even have to explain how ridiculous it is to act like  the Europeans were some saviors of nature, as that era is the same one *continental Europe had practically run out of its major forests.*

Europeans of course never cared about nature, nor they do now.

5708,"&gt; To separate ""superior"" cultures from others, you are obliged to use reference values that are obviously your own.

Some reference values (matters of taste) are subjective but there are plenty of objective criteria to judge performance of different cultures and societies. There are plenty of universal human values that are driven by biology and fundamental human needs rather than culture. Life without pain, misery and oppression is objectively better. Life with higher living standards is better. You can safely compare performance of different cultures based on how they perform on creating conditions in which people can thrive.

You can be really post modern and try to question all of those, but there are ways to practically put these ""different reference values"" to the test: just look at migration patterns. People voting with their feet tells you what's really going on more than any poll can. And migration patterns between west and non-west aren't 50:50 or 70:30, it's not even 90:10. It's 99:1 or 100:0.

Try thinking how , in a world were the nazis won, we might justify the holocaust even if we thought of it as terrible.
They might say that it was necessary. That to achieve a fast victory it needed to be done.

5871,"&gt; That has nothing to do with Islam specifically and more to do with religion generally in communist societies. China also tears down churches. Communism is atheistic. It is against all religions.

Thats not necessarily true. Some of the ancient religious sects lived in what we would call communism. According to some, Jesus was first communist.

Marx and Engels however formed their ideology in certain economical and gepolitical situation, they formulated their ideologies as a part of evolution of human society. I would put atheism as an essential part of even his formulation of communist ideology.

When we however go further and examine various communist states, you will quickly notice that every single one is more or less authoritarian. Its incorrect to call them ""atheist"" as multiple ones weren't and have a significant religious groups. Current Russia is significantly Orthodox, wouldn't happen if Soviet Union exterminated religion and religious beliefs, would it? The point that I am trying to make is that authoritarian states require your loyalty. You cannot be more loyal to Pope or some religious authority then to the state. If you are, well, then there is some problem and the state will view you as an enemy.

Many religious people have no problem in communist Czechoslovakia, as long as they were loyal to the state.

So to correct you, communism is not atheistic and is not against all religions, communism is against religion where it clashes with its ideology and authoritarian states are against anything that clashes with their authority.",,/r/europe/comments/ddovfm/man_in_france_who_killed_four_colleagues_had/f2p6ayb/,Unicorn_Colombo,1570338225

5953,"Look back a year, and remember how disquieting European politics seemed. Matteo Salvini, by far the most popular politician in Italy, and France’s equally xenophobic Marine Le Pen had just teamed up with Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s former strategist, as part of what Mr Bannon called The Movement. This alliance of nativist parties of the right, soon to acquire a “gladiator school” based in a monastery near Rome, intended to sweep the forthcoming European elections and tilt the continent’s politics firmly away from the liberal centre ground. They had their difficulties, of course. The Eurosceptic and anti-migrant Alternative for Germany (afd) decided to steer clear of Mr Bannon, and other right-wingers were wary too. But, with or without the American Svengali, populists seemed in the ascendant. In France the gilets jaunes (yellow jackets), who drew support from the radical right and left, were about to explode onto the streets.

The scene today is rather different. The European Parliament elections in May dashed Mr Bannon’s hopes. Mr Salvini’s Northern League did do well. But elsewhere the parties of the hard right fell back, or at best marked time. Since then, things have on the whole got worse for them. Mr Salvini is out of Italy’s government, having bungled an attempt to secure uncontested power, and has fallen back in the polls; in Hungary, Viktor Orban’s populist ruling party faces the threat of losing control of the country’s capital, Budapest, and perhaps other cities at local elections later this month. The gilets jaunes have been tamed by President Emmanuel Macron. And this week came the news that another key component of the populist right, Austria’s, has come to grief at the ballot box.

Gloating is not advised

All of these setbacks are partial and reversible. Even where the right-wingers have fallen back in places, they are far from a spent force. In Poland, for instance, the Law and Justice party, another example of the populist right, is expected to be re-elected on October 13th; the afd also did well in state elections in Germany last month.

But liberals can be excused a little satisfaction as they look at recent events. Take Austria first. In May the government collapsed after two German newspapers revealed footage from a video shot inside an Ibiza villa in 2017, showing Heinz-Christian Strache, Austria’s vice-chancellor and the leader of the hard-right Freedom Party (fpö), discussing corrupt deals with a woman posing as a Russian oligarch’s niece. The election on September 29th, triggered by the scandal, was a disaster for the fpö. It took just 16% of the vote, almost ten points less than in the 2017 election, and lost 20 mps. Many voters defected to the centre-right People’s Party (övp), which until Ibiza-gate was the fpö’s senior partner in government. Its young leader, Sebastian Kurz, will now sound out the Greens, the other big winner, as a coalition partner. Mr Strache has quit politics.

Mr Kurz had invited the fpö into coalition in 2017, telling concerned European leaders that he could tame its worst impulses. That seems to have been optimistic. The government was scarred by scandal during its short life, ranging from racist incidents involving fpö officials to an illegal raid on the domestic intelligence agency orchestrated by Herbert Kickl, an fpö hardliner who served as interior minister.

Being out of office does not, of course, mean that the fpö has vanished. The party hopes to recuperate in opposition. History suggests it will do so. It has been a fixture of Austrian politics for over 60 years, exploiting popular frustration with the long duopoly of the övp and the Social Democrats, and the corporatist Proporz system that divvied up public jobs and doled out patronage between the parties. Its xenophobia has been less of an electoral handicap in a country that did not go through a German-style post-Nazi reckoning. So when one or other mainstream party has grown tired of grand coalitions it has usually had nowhere to turn but to the fpö. Expect to hear from the party again in due course.

The same is true in Hungary. Mr Orban’s Fidesz party remains all-powerful in villages and small towns, but faces a strong challenge from the (almost) united opposition in Budapest and larger provincial cities at local elections due on October 13th. The Fidesz party machine has responded with both the potato and the stick: in Budapest’s 11th district, 10 kilo sacks of potatoes were sold for less than a euro, with a picture of the local Fidesz mayor attached, and a recipe for rakott krumpli, a Hungarian potato, egg and sausage delicacy.

There have also been fierce attacks on Gergely Karacsony, the united opposition candidate for mayor, who is running neck and neck with Istvan Tarlos, the Fidesz-backed incumbent, according to polls. After coming to power in 2010, Mr Orban changed Hungary’s electoral law to create a system that favours the strongest party—his own. It has taken the other parties, from left to right, years of squabbling and in-fighting to realise that the only way to challenge him is to band together, using primaries. Now they have done so. If they succeed, they will have a useful platform from which to challenge Mr Orban at the next parliamentary elections, due in 2022.

But it is in Italy that the fortunes of the populists have suffered the most consequential reverse. The European election was a resounding success for Mr Salvini. His party took more than a third of the votes in Italy. His non-stop campaigning and uncompromising stance on immigration helped his party to unprecedented heights in the polls. By early July, it was averaging 37.5%—a level of support that tempted him to take the misguided decision the following month to bring down the government of which he was part in the hope of forcing an election.

Strache’s end: another one bites the dust

The effect, instead, was to catapult his coalition partners in the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (m5s) into the arms of the centre-left Democratic Party (pd), creating a new parliamentary majority that underpins Giuseppe Conte’s second government. Since it was sworn in last month, Mr Salvini has plainly shrunk in stature. Deprived of power and the attention it attracts, he can no longer force himself to the top of the news agenda. Support for the League has fallen to below 32%.

Still, the League remains Italy’s biggest party, more than ten points ahead of either the pd or the m5s in the polls. Though down, Mr Salvini is certainly not spent. By removing himself from office, he has avoided having to reconcile his extravagant promises to the electorate with the reality of Italy’s public finances. On September 30th the new government approved a framework document that proposes an increased budget deficit of 2.2% of gdp. That may yet prove too much for Brussels, provoking a fresh showdown.

Mr Salvini’s prospects will depend on two factors. The first is immigration. The new government has scrapped his policy of closing Italian ports to the ngos that rescue migrants from the Mediterranean. It is hoping instead to extend a scheme agreed last month with France, Germany and Malta for the voluntary redistribution of asylum seekers landing on Italian shores. But a surge in arrivals would boost Mr Salvini’s popularity. Though still low, the number has risen sharply since he left office.

However popular Mr Salvini becomes, the League will not get back into power unless the current coalition falls. So how the government manages the tensions between its component groups will be decisive. The pd and the m5s have a long record of mutual animosity, and a split in the pd caused by Matteo Renzi, a former prime minister, has not helped. The new government is trying to change an electoral system that, thanks to its large number of first-past-the-post seats, helps the League. Much depends on whether the new coalition lasts long enough to do it.

As for Mr Bannon, he now faces being kicked out of his monastery by the authorities who say his associates there, who deny any wrongdoing, have failed to meet their financial obligations.
