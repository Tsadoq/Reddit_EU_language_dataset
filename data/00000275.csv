Right now I fail to see their reason aside from power political calculations. The FDP has a comparatively vague ideological core. They won the election with a message of progress, modernization and the promise to improve the country. Overall, they are a rather pragmatic party.

Since the FDP is politically located somewhere in between Union and Greens they were the ones that had to accept the least compromises.

I would think that most FDP voters wanted their party to actively influence the country by being part of a government.

They even had to make courses to learn them how the Parliament actually work. As far as the ministers are, most of them are completly unknown to most French and completly muted by the medias because they lack charisma, guts, political smartness, who knows.

So yeah, the dude sure knows how to sell himself, he's a brand and his team are doing a fantastic marketing job, specially around the world. What is fucking outrageous for us French, is that dude spend more time with Foreign medias that are eating in his hand instead of French Medias.

In fact, this is becoming a big thing here. That dude just refuse to speack to the media as if he didn't have to explain himself. His own party got a new leader that he designed himself... The dude doesn't to give 2 shits about democracy since he's been elected.

At some point, internationnal matters won't matters anymore and with that attitude of his, snobing frenchs as he does, he might very well follow Holland's step and stay with a low popularity until the end of his only mandate.

I agree with the statement made here by OP. The Catalonan government was democraticaly elected by the Spanish constitution, and that same (democraticaly voted in favour of) constitution says that Catalonia can't choose to become independant on it's own. 

The EU stands for democracy and human rights by saying it's up for the democraticaly elected government of Spain to uphold the democraticaly choosen constitution of Spain.

270,"If you look at it from an individual party perspective, it might offer some explanations. I can only speculate as of now but:

* The FDP might actually play the long game here and hope to reestablish their position in the political landscape. The last governing coalition with the CDU/CSU ended in a Chernobyl-like disaster for the FDP and they do not want a repeat. By not bending much to the CDU/CSU and the Greens, they can hope for gains in a reelection, from the more libertarian/business factions of the CDU/CSU and AfD and the soft-conservatives in the CDU/CSU. The CSU is already quite vulnerable with their low polling numbers. Also, another factor is the distribution of ministry positions. The FDP already expressed their dislike of a CDU-lead finance ministry (which the CDU/CSU would probably not give out without making the FDP compromising on significant issues) and with the Greens for the infrastructure ministry. So, from a party strategy, it isn't completely out of the blue.

* In case of an reelection, the big parties of CDU/CSU and the SPD have the most to loose, the smaller parties the least, since they count on political polarization being even more apparent than before. For the CDU and especially Merkel, a reelection would be a catastrophe, both in PR and politically. The rise of the AfD has opened a door for a nationwide right-wing contender party, which not only threatens the marriage with the CSU in Bavaria, but also the union as a traditional monopoly on right-wing topics.

* The Greens would probably also not go up in flames if there were a reelection. They stayed relatively stable and made small gains since the last election. Many of their political points were either squeezed out or they had to compromise over them, so they could hope for a larger mandate. They were not very happy with the Jamaica constellation either way.

* Regarding foreign politics, a heavily weakened Merkel or a non-Merkel government could have major consequences for world politics right now, with the EU/Eurozone reforms, with Brexit, with Turkey and in general with the geostrategic position of the West.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7e49np/liberal_party_fdp_quits_coalition_negotiations/dq2o4uh/,theusualguy512,1511146402

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/01/poland-gets-official-warning-from-eu-over-constitutional-court-changes

Also, the current government is actively using nationalism and populism (making the people scared by telling them the Russians want to invade Poland), using lies to stay in power. Also economically, it doesn't go well. When they joined the EU, Poland recieved tens of billions of euro's from the EU's regional development fund, and the money was invested in infrastructure and the development of institutions. The idea behind it was that Poland would (after getting a boost) would atract foreign investments. But those foreign investments are laking behind, and a slowdown of groth of the Polish economy awaits. Foreign investers want stability (socialy and politicaly) and Poland isn't providing this. In fact, it's so bad, even the Polish people that went working abroad because they were utter poor, don't want to return to Poland and stay in the countries to went to work to. If Poland doesn't change soon, it will get behind socialy and economicaly even further. Poland started out with such great potential: very poor citizens that wants to work for almost nothing, a enormous financial injection by the EU regional development fund, a new beginning (after the fall of the USSR) to become a western European society, a stable government needed for foreign investments, a free press and justice system...Where did it go wrong?

There is.

There wouldn't be such an agreement. Plenty of AfD MPs completely rule out doing anything with the CDU. Especially given that many of them are former CDU people. And the government wouldn't be stable as some of the core demands of the AfD are simply not acceptable for Germany as a pro-EU country.

Yes. Polls right now mean very little, wait for the first polls after we have certainty that we will have new elections, and you will see a change.

So you have public money used for all those churches already built, and a lack of public money to answer to the needs of local population of Muslim obedience. And as a result of this issue, foreign groups barge in to finance the needed mosques. A few of them really attempt a cultural push.

So do we only spy on them and/or kick them out as needed ? That's what we've been doing. This could be endless as there's a deficit in mosques and many to build that will provide opportunities for foreign influence. Or do we take over the building of mosques according to local needs ?

Think of the internet as a series of pipes connecting various computers around the world. At a simplified level, companies called ISPs own these pipes and pay each other as part of peering agreements (I'll carry your data to my consumers if you do the same).

Net neutrality is the concept that you pay your ISP a fixed price per month and then have the ability to access whatever websites you'd like at no additional cost. In the US, companies like Comcast don't like this, since they'd rather make additional money by bundling services to you like the cable model (where you pay extra if you'd like to access more premium channels) while at the same time, promote their own services (channels they own) as part of the base bundle.

They've gotten around this for the most part by either outright legislating (via lobbying) in certain areas so other ISPs are either unable to set up networks, or legally not allowed to. Now they're trying to get the FCC to make it so that ISPs can legally discriminate for or against the content on their pipes.

Data caps on wired networks are for the most part an artificial creation to help ISPs squeeze more money out of the consumer, since data is not a finite resource like water. Once these pipes are laid, it costs very little for the ISPs (relative to the cost of laying them) to maintain these pipes.",,/r/europe/comments/7dzn12/alone_in_the_rain_95yearold_greek_resistance/dq29b6d/,IAmGabensXB1,1511129155
441,"Well, industrialized countries naturally face population decline as their people make fewer babies. That's now viewed as the normal evolution of societies as any geographer will tell you.

Then you have three extreme ways of dealing with this population decline in rich countries. The Western way is to open doors to massive immigration of unskilled labour from massively different cultures and countries which continue to breed as if Earth had infinite resources. The far-eastern way (exemplified by countries like Japan and South Korea) is very limited immigration, and rather a reliance on robotization. Then there are these oil-rich autocracies (Saudi Arabia, UAE..etc), basically socialist states for their citizens which use foreign slave labour, treating them like animals who'll never earn any rights. 

I prefer the Japanese and South Korean way. Seems like the obviously smarter move in the long run if you want to preserve your culture and social structure. Already, they're not experiencing the social unrest Western countries are. They're unified societies. Terrorism, to give the most extreme example, is hardly even a factor in their society. As robots replace more and more human jobs, the need for immigration is lessened. They're ahead of the curve.

444,"Yes, that's the historical consensus in the West, but it's an illogical myth that's stupefyingly easy to knock down.

The top men that were purged were mostly militarily illiterate. They had little to no military education. They rose through the ranks during the Russian Civil War for one of two reasons:

I) revolutionary fervor

or

II) they were one of the very few Russian Imperial officers that joined the Reds instead of the Whites during the Civil War

The men they were replaced with weren't saddled with WWI-era mentality, ideological baggage, and they were graduates of military schools and academies. A few numbers, for context:

At the start of the purge in 1937, of the upper echelons of the RKKA(i.e Kombrig and above - Kombrigs commanded Brigades and after the reintroduction of the old rank system were renamed to Major-General), only 29% had graduated from a military academy. In 1938, at the height of the purge, that number rose to 38%. By 1941, that number rose to 52%.

The most annoying part of this myth, for me, is the lionisation of Tukhachevsky. He's portrayed as this genius father of Soviet military operational art and military doctrine, when in reality he comes of as being borderline mentally handicapped(the reason he and all of his friends were purged is because he was loudly extolling the virtues of Hitler and Nazi Germany to Romanian, French, etc, officials, at diplomatic functions and banquets while the Soviet Union was begging France and Britain to form an alliance with him against Hitler...just how stupid was he, to think that Stalin would let that pass?). I mean for the first five year plan, his brilliant idea was to arm a peace-time RKKA with 50,000 armored fighting vehicles by requisitioning civilian tractors and other agricultural machinery and arming them. 

The actual father of Soviet military science was this Greek bloke from Armenia:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Triandafillov

He is the unsung hero of Soviet military history. Graduated from a military academy in 1923 and in a couple of years he rose to become the Head of Operational Command of the General Staff of the Red Army. In 1928, he became the #2 in the General Staff, when he was 34. In 1931, he and another key Soviet military theoretician, with whom Triandafillov lead the mechanisation reforms of the Red Army, the 34 year old K. B. Kalinovsky, died in a plane crash near Moscow. The Politburo considered this such a blow to the Soviet military that they decided that no high-ranking Soviet official may fly again.

489,"&gt;The constitution on the other hand clearly states that you need the approval of all republics to change the borders of Yugoslavia. So, in that way, it was illegal. The commission did rule in your favor, which was to be expected of a western commission.

The necessary approval of all federal units for changing the borders of SFRY doesn't apply in the case of the dissolution of SFRY, which was the result of the will of the federal republics that make up the territory. This opinion, given by the Badinter Arbitration Committee in the link above, was in accordance with the principles and rules of international law.

&gt;I´m not excusing them, though I do consider the right of the Serbs in Croatia to secede fully valid.

Your opinion on the matter is completely irrelevant, the illegality of the Serbian attempt to secede by international law was made clear by the Committee.

&gt;What they did was a response to the changes the new government led by the HDZ was making, with clear intentions of leaving Yugoslavia. Again, if you can leave so can they.

No, they didn't. The Serbs in Croatia started the armed rebellion against Croatia and the new democratically elected government, as I stated above, on August 17, 1990, before any changes were made with the intent to proclaim independence. Even by the end of 1990, the intent was still, in co-operation with Slovenia, to seek the solution for the political and economical crisis in SFRY by transforming SFRY on a confederal basis, as an alliance of sovereign states ^[[1]](https://hr.wikisource.org/wiki/Govor_Franje_Tu%C4%91mana_prigodom_progla%C5%A1enja_Ustava_RH_22._prosinca_1990.) . The only changes that were made by the time the Serbs started the armed rebellion were the changes to the Constitution to remove socialist names and symbols from official use, in accordance with the democratic changes in the country ^[[2]](https://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/1990_07_31_610.html) .

&gt;Your very report clearly shows far larger Serb casualties than Croat ones.

The above report gives two sources on actual losses in Croatia during WWII, one of which states ""Croatia: 295,000, of which 125,000 were Serbs and Montenegrins, 124,000 were Croats, (...)"", and the second ""Croatia: 271,000, of whom 131,000 were Serbs, 106,000 were Croats, (...)"".  Both very comparable.

&gt;And I don´t recall Serbs opening up concentration camps for Croats, especially not camps specifically made for Croat children. So no, the losses aren´t comparable.

Neither did Croats open camps for Serbs, especially not just for Serbian children. The Nazis and Ustaše did, however, open a number of camps for Jews, Partisan, Chetniks, and anyone (even if they were Croat) who was thought to be an opponent of the regime ^[[3]](http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=199376) .

&gt;And if you´re going to count what the Partisans did after the war, well, Serbs also got fucked by them.

Funny you should say that, as a large number of Croats were killed by the Ustaše regime as well, even in the Jasenovac concentration camp ^[[4]](http://www.jusp-jasenovac.hr/Default.aspx?sid=6284) ^[[5]](https://hrcak.srce.hr/109878) .

&gt;No, you weren´t.

As I said, your opinion is irrelevant here. We were victims of aggression and ethnic cleansing from the rebel Serbs and Serbia ^[[6]](https://miseticlaw.blogspot.hr/2015/02/the-two-most-important-findings-in.html) .

&gt;It was still part of Yugoslavia. Everything else doesn´t really matter. If Serbia attacked Croatia now, that would be aggression. But back then Croatia was not an independent country, and as such no aggression could be made. 

Republic of Croatia, as stated above, was sovereign republic of SFRY and it finished it's process of disassociation from SFRY on October 8, 1991 ^[[7]](https://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/1991_10_53_1265.html) . Since international law, in the link above, defines ""Aggression is the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State"", where the term State ""Is used without prejudice to questions of recognition or to whether a State is a member of the United Nations"", the rebel Serbs and Serbia did commit the act of aggression against Republic of Croatia.",,/r/europe/comments/7drptu/on_this_day_26_years_ago_croatian_city_of_vukovar/dq29qzs/,Labatorec,1511129638

Now, it obviously is more complex than this but as far as 'violating the law' goes, this is as civil as it can get. They perceive it as an injustice that they have no house of worship and that they're not getting help with a suitable piece of land to build one. Hence they're taking to the streets which at the very least at least gets their issue noticed. The alternative is simply sucking it up and/or moving elsewhere which isn't something anyone should have to deal with based on their religion.

Hell, the interior minister seems to agree with their perspective:
&gt;""Muslims must have a place of worship to pray.""

This is blatantly false. Europeans didn't advance far inland at all and practically all military activity was focused around the coasts. The British and French didn't even want to conquer any land from China aside from treaty ports since it was far more beneficial keeping the Qing somewhat stable so that it would be easier to sell opium. 

A de facto conquest of China would imply that the Qing had no control over any land and that all of China's territory was administrated by Europeans. This obviously wasn't the case as the Qing still controlled practically all of China in both of the wars and European control was restricted to individual cities on the coast.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/7dzxdg/lands_that_have_been_conquered_by_europeans_my/dq231k8/,Bluntforce9001,1511122600

And you cannot influence how grace of God lets people to heaven. You sort of have to have blind faith.

So in theory if at his last moments Hitler had a deep true belief in the sacrifice of Christ and God, he could have ended in heaven by the grace of God, whereas some nice church lady who did nice deeds for all her life might end up in Hell, if for some reasons known to god her faith was not genuine and God denies grace from her.",,/r/europe/comments/7e00y1/helping_the_poor_is_a_passport_to_paradise_pope/dq1vj4t/,Toby_Forrester,1511114435

623,"&gt;It's not 1€ to 2€. 

By that site I linked you, it's actually more like €2.2 to €1 but lets not sweat it.

&gt; Necessities like food, clothing, electricity are 1:1. 
Food is averaging twice as expensive in Ireland in those figures. The only ones less than 150% the price are rice, cheese, and lettuce. 

Electricity and clothes, yep - about equal. That's a fair observation.

&gt;And please don't tell me 42k is hard to achieve in Dublin. Capitals are the most expensive places in all countries but it has highest salaries too.

Median salary in Dublin is actually under the Average Industrial Wage - so for more than 50% of the population, yeah, it's actually really difficult to get over 42k. Especially if you're not in a high skilled role, or you're young (grad salaries are in the €20k's). Those people also need to live somewhere.

&gt;No one is forcing you to live in Dublin. Ireland isn't a shithole, you can live in other cities, smaller cities. Why people even want to move to a big city? It's overcrowded, prices are crazy, what's the point? To be a part of careerist sheep? 

For most people they have to follow the work. Most of Ireland's industry is based in Dublin, Cork or Galway - all of which have housing problems - so if you have industry skill sets or qualifications, you either work in one of those three, and choke down the rent/commute, or you don't work. It's not careerist - it's survival. 

Then, since that leads to literally half of Ireland's population living in Dublin's metro area/commuter belt, that means that half of all those service jobs are in Dublin as well - so if you run a shop, mind children, cut hair, sell coffee, make sandwiches, etc. chances are you have to do it in Dublin/Cork/Galway to make ends meet because your local town already has established businesses doing what you'd do.

&gt;There are many options, one of them is, you can live with your parents for couple of years, work, save, ask your parents to give 10k and here you go a deposit.

Living with your parents only works if you're from Dublin (the majority of Dubs do live with their families) &amp; your parents have the space (not guaranteed), and getting cash from your parents only works if they can afford to give it to you (also not guaranteed). 

Also worth pointing out, you're looking at 20k for a deposit *if* you can find a place at 200k. Starting grad salaries, as I said, are in the €20k's before tax and those are professionally qualified salaries. Take home pay is probably around the €20k mark.

So you're looking at them having the ability to get a mortgage for about €85k-100k *if* they can get together a deposit and have a permanent contract at work. Which won't get them a place in Dublin.

665,"The book I based by post on only devotes a couple pages to the GDR, but this is what I can gather from that and my general knowledge:

Because of its self-image as an Anti-Fascist/Anti-Imperialist state, the GDR didn't publically honour the ""fallen of Fascism"". It also didn't work to keep and repair memorials to the dead of 1870/1 or 1914-18. That work was done by churches, private clubs or persons. 

However, they absolutely did memorialise the Soviet war dead and Communist/Socialist resistance members. Interestingly, those officially pacifistic memorials ended up mirroring exactly those ""Imperialistic"" ones once you look past the ideology, because of their ""heroic"" nature, while in the West new memorials tended to focus on mourning and the loss of life.

There was an official day for the victims of Fascism with the official title ""International Memorial Day for the Victims of Fascist Terror and Day of Struggle Against Fascism and Imperialist War"" - quite a mouthful, that. The actual festivities were mostly similar to what you'd find in the West - speeches, laying down wreaths, dedication of memorial plaques, ect. Just the content was obviously influenced by the unique character of the GDR. It traced itself back to those members of the resistance and as such viewed itself as the offspring of *heroes* rather than *perpetrators*. It shouldn't be understated how influential this is in context of how East Germans were raised and how they therefore looked at themselves and their history. 

Now to the Old Guardhouse from the OP. The heavily damaged building was dedicated to the ""victims of Fascism and Militarism"" in 1960. It was then redesigned in 1969, now containing a grave of an unknown soldier and an unkown member of the resistance. There was also a glass coffin with an eternal flame inside to represent the victims. From 1962 to 1990 there was a permanent guard posted in front of the building, including a ""changing of the guards"" ceremony by the Honour Guard of the Guard Battalion ""Friedrich Engels"" that became a huge tourist attraction. Maybe to the surprise of many (including me when I found out), the GDR kept a lot of the military traditions that had been dropped by the West -the goosestep, the uniforms, the swords, the massive parades. [You can watch the last ever changing of the guards on Youtube to get a look yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwSYz82k1KA).

You are misrepresenting what issue about the march. In our country a minister would have said it was a nice march except for those few neo nazis who tried to besmirch it and that their presence was unwelcome. But yours didn't, first he denied they were there, then he said it was nice anyways. This is sidestepping the issue, refusing to deal with it. There's a world of difference between not endorsing something and saying that it is unacceptable. Your politicians made a decision.

The point about the number of refugees is perhaps a little difficult to understand. Since there are so few Muslim immigrants and Syrian refugees in your country, one assumes that it is not a real issue in Poland, as most Poles will not have noticed their arrival in any way. Instead of causing real issues, they serve as an excuse and a smokescreen to justify government policies. That's why it's relevant that a grand total of 18 Syrian refugees made it to your country last year, but it is not that Poland is so unattractive that no more wanted to come.

Finally the Polish Catholic church is a politicized church, that makes them relevant in political discussions. In certain standpoints your kind of Catholicism is as far from our general discourse as the mullahs from Iran. The new Argentinian pope could say that he wasn't going to judge gay people, but not the recent Polish one, indeed a reader of Polish won't have to look hard at all to find good godly churchmen from Poland who says that the gay rights movement is undermining Polish Catholic values.

Lol, most of the leaders of the decolonization movement were motivated by the ideas of socialism that they discovered through western intellectuals (such as Kenyatta, for example) or by direct visit to the USSR like Nehru. Latin american movements were also inspired by the ideas against imperialism of Lenin and Marx, too.

You'd know that if you had actually read some history. Admit that you have never even remotely read any book about history since you went out of high school.

&gt;Are you saying that increased literacy justifies killing 100 million people?

Source on the 100 million dead people? If you quote the black book of communism, try to explain how they get to that number in the book. Don't worry, if you don't I'll understand since you're just repeating what you heard on TV or on internet forums.

Good job linking whatever random article you found in a quick google search trying to show the evils of communism in a capitalist country.

&gt;But keep telling yourself that socialism works while all it takes is having a look at economic growth in Chile under Pinochet to see what actually works.

What the fuck? How can you be so proud of your ignorance? Pinochet literally gave the Chicago boys complete freedom to apply their economic reforms and things got so bad that Pinochet sacked them from the country.

&gt; But I have a feeling that those are not the issues you find troubling, would racially pure ethno state be more your thing?

This just shows how little you know about me and Poland.

&gt; What the Dutch article you read on Google translate said is probably true,

Blindly believe someone repeating lies about a place they have never been to. Its not, lets take a look:

&gt; Glowing, glowing neo-Nazis, was my first thought early Sunday morning.

Great start! I guess you also agree with Verhofstadt that there were 60 thousand fascist, neonazis and white supremacists...

&gt; They sang songs, there were slogans: 'God, honor, fatherland', 'Pure blood', or 'Fuck off with the refugees'.

""God, honor, fatherland (homeland)"" is the motto of the Polish Army, first officially used in WWII - when they fought against nazis, but sure - chanting this makes you a nazi...

There were literally 4-5 banners with inappropriate (to say the least) signs like ""Pure blood"". Does that represent 60 thousand people in any way? Everyone condemned these slogans, from the president, through government officials like minister Glinski and PiS leader Kaczynski, all the way to the march organizers. There is only one person I heard of (not from the government) that defended them, there was an instant reaction and he is being thrown out of his organization.

Ive went over several articles, many repeated things along the lines of ""fuck off refugees"", yet not a single one provided any proof of this (just like the ""Islam holocaust"" which they after a couple days admitted to be fake), even though the march was widely covered (media, live streamers, etc)

&gt; My eyes immediately stung from the red smook.

What? Do you have a better translation, Im curious.

&gt; Nuance: those 60,000 were not all neo-Nazis! No, much worse, they were ordinary worried Poles, daddies with children on their necks - apparently demoralized in a neo-fascist lantern parade.

It was NOT a neo-fascist parade. It was the Independence March, the only ""ideology"" behind it was to celebrate regaining independence and to support Polish traditions and patriotism - nothing more.

&gt; Nuance: this parade has been taking place for years! What is new is that the government called it ""a beautiful sight"" .

Yes, 60 thousand people celebrating Independence without any major incidents, a ocean of Polish flags, tens of thousands of people singing the national anthem, it was quite beautiful. A little more context for this statement: the same day of the march minister Blaszczak was asked about the racist banners, he said he didnt see any (not surprising considering there were a handful among 60k people) and he later said: the march was quite beautiful.

&gt; Nuance: that one photo of a banner, eh, with the text 'Pray for an Islamic Holocaust', which turned out to be a different protest !

People also thought that was ""probably true."" It was from a couple years back, from a completely different city, nothing to do with the Independence March...

&gt; Right. Real texts like 'Europe will be white' or the crusade slogan 'Deus Vult', in Gothic font. And I forget some Nazi symbols.

Again, literally a handful of these among 60k.

&gt; The official slogan, by the way, was 'We want God', which more specifically meant the Catholic, homohating, Polish, anti-Muslim god - I think. But I'm honestly checked out a bit.

That was the official slogan, and? The rest is just something the author made up. He knows better what those 60 thousand people actually think!

&gt; Since then, the media has been curtailed, judges dismissed, the army muzzled.

Empty slogans I highly suspect the author knows absolutely nothing about.

&gt; In which the anger marches,

Again, not true. It was a celebration of 60 thousand people, in which there was a marginal group of despicable people.

&gt; in this creamy white country, 18 (eighteen!) Syrian refugees were admitted this year (yes, but still!).

And how many Syrians requested asylum in Poland? How many were refused? Lets not pretend they are trying to come live in Poland and the evol government does not let them in. When a couple families from Syria were flown over directly to Poland by a private foundation, they ran off to Germany in the first week.

&gt; The Soviet beacon has now disappeared in a forest of skyscrapers.

Once again, no clue about Poland, just making up things that sound smart. It sticks out like a thumb, very visible, no skyscrapers around it. I tried to link to pictures, but my comment was deleted for it. Just search for ""Palac Kultury"" and you will see for yourself the ""forest of skyscrapers"" hiding it...

&gt; giving the angry voters what they want won't stop them from continuing to vandalize our liberal heritage which is the basis for all our freedoms. Instead we could try to resolve some of their other issues, but just cowardly giving in and hoping that will satisfy the horde won't safe our kind of society from their attacks.

You read a couple articles and you speak of: anger, hatred, vandalism, hordes, attacks. You have no clue what you are talking about, just like many MEPs that want to decide what Poland has to do. Who knows better what is going on in Poland, Poles? Or an author/MEP that has never been and is just blindly repeating things other people said?

""Brief period of occupation"" often implies conquest. It seems difficult to make the case that Ethiopia wasn't *conquered* by Europeans: an European army literally invaded and conquered the country not that long ago. And another European army put an end to the occupation. Mongolia was a de facto Russian dominion - they didn't invade the whole country because it wasn't necessary. The opium wars were a de facto conquest of China. I'd definitely paint these three red.

Japan was nominally conquered by the Allied forces that included Europeans, but it was a de facto American conquest, so fair enough.

Nepal, Buthan and Thailand lost wars against Europeans and ceded a big chunk of territory; the first two were basically protectorates. A bit akin to Vichy France and Germany. Tonga was never exactly militarily conquered but only because they became a British protectorate. Not really sure what to make of these.

North Korea was put under Soviet control post-war, but there was never an European conquest of Korea, so I'd keep it read.

934,"For Greece, this is completely false, actually. Greek citizenship isn't awarded

First of all, if you are a legal resident and you join the military, by the end of your service you will become a citizen. Yeah it takes a year and people don't do it. But it's technically false to say that you need to ""wait"" to become a citizen of Greece.

As for the rest of the methods it's never as easy as ""be in Greece for X amount of time"" ""meet requirements"" ""send papers"" ""you're done"".

The only person who used to have the right to award Greek citizenship was the King. And now the President of the Republic fulfills that role through a Citizenship Act. If Greece didn't recently annex your region (That's where a citizenship Act happens) and you don't inherit your citizenship from your ancestry, foster parents, by being married, then there's really three ways to get it:

The first method is to ask politely for a Provincial citizenship, which will guarantee you the nationality (still technically not full citizenship - but you can vote - and your children will be citizens at birth - so basically citizenship) However, this is almost impossible. First it requires to be in Greece for 10-12 years depending on the local law, and also you actually have to have a strong case to argue that you should be a Greek citizen in a court of law. I've read somewhere that in the entire history of this country less than 2000 people have gotten their citizenship this way. And even one child of Lord Byron couldn't get it. 

The second is to Join the military. This doesn't have a time-frame you can do it as soon as your residency permit is in your hands, although the military can reject your application and will if you have... say Turkish citizenship. Since they aren't really playing their chances with spies and whatnot.

And the most recent way is to be a child of legal residents that by the age of 18 has attended all 12 years of Greek primary and secondary education.

-

All of this to say that the number should be 10 or 12. But you shouldn't expect to get citizenship then either. Unless you can trace your ancestry back to Lord Byron or other philhellenes or something, or have been here since birth with no parents and see Greece as your one and only home. Really edge cases. But you can have permanent legal residency in Greece, and it will pass to your children and they will become citizens when they attend a Greek school.

1036,"The *Volkstrauertag* of today has developed out of what started in the Weimar Republic as a remembrence for the fallen of WWI. Excerpt from the speech of Paul Löbe in 1922, then President of the Reichstag:

&gt;A people that honours its dead shall wrap a ribbon around many souls and shall also extend that ribbon to the mother on the Volga and the Tiber, to soothe pain, heal wounds, honour the dead, mourn the lost. It means rejection of hatred, a turning towards love

This practice changed drastically under National Socialist rule. The day was renamed *Heldengedenktag* (Day of Remembrence of Heroes), these heroes also included the NSDAP members killed until 1933. No longer was individual pain or reconciliation the focus, but the raising of war-readiness of the population. Flags would no longer be flown at half-mast and Hitler used the occasion in 1935 to proclaim the re-institution of conscriptment.

1046,"First of all, the era of viking raids as quick ""hit and run"" attacks was brief. Relatively soon the vikings occupied various areas and became integrated in the local populations to varying degrees. Nordic expansion into e.g. Estonia, Britain, Ireland, Normandy, Kievan Rus and even Sicily soon exposed them 
to Christianity to a great extent. Denmark also saw missionaries very early.

Most Nordic *rulers* converted relatively early - it both gave them legitimacy to have the church behind them and ability to tell their populations they derived their power from a God many of them came to see as more powerful than the Norse gods, especially as they came into contact with the Catholic church and realized the economic and military power of the church and its allies.

As a result there was a long period of mounting pressure on the populations - though with very varying degrees of force applied - to convert. At the same time the establishment of Nordic fiefdoms and kingdoms outside the Nordic countries led to expanding trade between the rest of Europe and the Nordic countries, with trade routes extending even further. Nordic countries traded far into present day Russia, the Black Sea and most of the Mediterranean as well as across Northern Europe and Western Europe, and that brought Christian traders as well as priests back to the Nordic countries. 

[There are even at least two cases of runic viking age grafitti in the Hagia Sophia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runic_inscriptions_in_Hagia_Sophia)...

By the 12th century, rulers in both Norway, Denmark and Sweden were participating in crusades. E.g. King Sigurd I of Norway sailed to Jerusalem to participate in the crusades (it's such a formative part of Norwegian history it is part of our national anthem).

Subsequently Christianity *was* definitively forced on the populations by the governing elite very firmly. The Nordic countries have to a varying extent been amongst the strictest Lutheran countries, with e.g. Norway not abandoning a state controlled church until 2012, and with blasphemy still being a crime until 2015 (though it was not used for decades, with the last time it was used for censorship being Life of Brian in 1980, and the last time anyone was prosecuted under it was 1933).

So while our past *rulers* did not necessarily had it forced on them, they certainly subjected their populations to various degrees of religious oppression for many centuries in the name of Christianity.

It took somewhere between 200-400 years to christianize scandinavia. It took a really long time for the people to accept the religion, and much of the folklore never went away to the catholics dismay.

1078,"Because the argument for following these gods were generally one of how powerful they were seen. 

There were stories (though this may very well be a later fabrication) of how Olaf II Haraldsson as part of conversion in Norway (note that it is disputed how actively he actually converted the locals) would trick people by having men in hiding with torches while he argued for the supremacy of Christ, and when people didn't buy it would supposedly challenge the Norse gods to prove their power, before offering to have God prove his power by having his hidden men torch a building or two and claim it was Gods doing.

Whether the story is true or not, it reflects an idea of why people would convert: Whether it was by deception or simply threatening to kill people, when their old Gods did not protect them, why would they continue to believe?

If nothing else, the supremacy of the rulers who had long since converted to gain favor with rulers elsewhere, stood out of a sign of the power of the Christian god to the locals, and with money being poured into building churches as bringing in priests and missionaries, it was just a matter of time.

&gt; The Minister of Defense, María Dolores de Cospedal, has been the victim of a joke by two comedians posing as members of the Ministry of Defense of Latvia to inform her that former Catalan President Carles Puigdemont is a Russian spy nicknamed Cipollino.

&gt; The joke has been broadcast by the Russian news agency Sputnik. In the video of the conversation the Russian humorist Alexei Stoliarov identifies himself as the Latvian Minister of Defense and offers Cospedal to share with her information from the Latvian intelligence services on the role of Russia in the Catalan conflict.

&gt; Among other issues, he informs the Spanish minister that the expresident Puigdemont has been working ""for the Russian Intelligence for a long time"" and that his nickname is Chipolino. He also indicates that 50% of Russian tourists traveling to Catalonia are, in fact, ""part of the russian special sevices"". ""50%?"" Asks incredulous Cospedal.


&gt; At various moments in the conversation, which also involves the comedian Vladimir Kuznetsov, Latvian aid is offered, including the participation of the Army, and collaboration to address the information obtained by the secret services of neighboring countries and Ukraine with the objective to avoid that the situation in Catalonia ends up in a scenario similar to that of Donbas in the Ukraine.

&gt; ""I would like you to take it seriously, in any case we are willing to support you with the displacement of our army in the territory of Barcelona in very short terms,"" ​​the comedian tells the minister, who is grateful for the information throughout the conversation. received and commits to transfer it to the President of the Government, Mariano Rajoy, with the objective, even, of a possible personal encounter.

&gt; On the situation in Catalonia, the Minister of Defense points out in the conversation that she is ""somewhat more controlled"" and recalls that the ""lies"" of the Catalan independence movement are ""being unmasked throughout Europe"". ""But it is important that the whole truth be known,"" he says of the possible Russian collaboration with the former Catalan government.

&gt; Cospedal denies that he 'swallowed' the joke
After releasing the video Cospedal said that at no time trusted the content of the conversation with a Russian humorist. ""It was a very strange conversation,"" the defense minister admitted. ""I asked to speak in English and they did not want, they have removed the translator,"" he explained in a note on his personal Twitter account.


&gt; Cospedal, who during the conversation with the comedian shows his disbelief when he is informed that 50% of Russian tourists traveling to Spain are agents of the Kremlin, has stressed that she stopped talking by not trusting his interlocutor.


&gt; ""As I did not trust, I left to speak and I did not call again, now I know they were Russians"", said the defense minister, who during the meeting is grateful for the information received and agrees to transfer it to the Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, with the objective, even, of a possible personal encounter.",III Spanish Republic,/r/europe/comments/7dzsx9/2_russian_pranksters_convince_spains_defense/dq1gujd/,AoaeIeUeaoe,1511086909

That was also something that was rather uniquly peaceful of that time. The treaties he did after the establishment of the German empire were mainly defensive treaties to cut off French from forming a coalition they could use to run over Germany.

are you serious, I'm mean that for real...that is you actual view in this????? No one is trash talking the UK in any way, the first official response from the EU was, we will miss you.......
The other member states are extremely quiet on the whole manner only, on occasion saying that in their view the UK needs to live op to their previously made promises....
Otherwise give me an example?......

The british press/ some government officials and brexiteers have done nothing but been giant assholes in their communication towards member states, whilst claiming the UK is being victimized by the big bad EU...it is pathetic (from the British press threatening war, gov officials like may threatening to become a tax have and scrapping security cooperation before the negotiations began, to the foreign secretary eating cake, drinking prosecco etc, to Davis standing in front of a german audience stating they must not be stupid). The smugness, sense of superiority and now victimization coming from the UK is so sad and pathetic. And the constant lies about the EU in the British press. 

&gt;leaking info and extremely unethical

tone down the hyperbole, talking about the negotiations to the public is hardly unethical, specifically why is it unethical? perhaps a negotiation tactic or a dickish message, but hardly unethical. As if the UK hasn't used every tool in the box (GCHQ etc) trying to find an issue by which they can drive a wedge....The UK is not a victim or an noble underdog. 75 years ago it was heroically alone amongst enemies, now its pathetically alone amongst friends",,/r/europe/comments/7drnah/survey_evidence_europeans_support_the_eus_hard/dq1ezbw/,spymaster427,1511081350

have you ever seen a map (or a definition) of Europe that includes Georgia and Azerbaijan but excludes Armenia? because I don't think I have. and, btw, I'd be quicker to include the entire Turkey, than to kick out Armenia, but really what does it matter in the context of that particular map? Turkey and Russia get cut at the border because they're both huge and it would considerably change the whole thing, Armenia is so small it doesn't really matter. I don't think there's much of any philosophy behind it; they just had to stop somewhere. and that decision over any other doesn't really add to the perceived inaccuracy of this map; which may or may not be the case (since it's density and not just sheer population, I didn't do the math). and isn't that the issue we should be discussing instead?

I have seen = Ich habe gesehen,
I saw = Ich sah;
I was seen = Ich wurde gesehen,
I will see = Ich werde sehen (Sometimes in colloquial speech: Ich will mal sehen.)

I think the water is cold = Ich denke, das Wasser ist kalt,
I thought the water was cold= Ich dachte, das Wasser war kalt.

Deciphering words in the sentences above with the consonant shift:
th becomes d; d becomes t; t becomes s,z,ß; ght becomes cht

It seems what matters to you is the ability to be supported outside of the mother's body. 

&gt; Or another situation: what if the parents cannot provide for a decent future? What if another child would perpetuate poverty? Would it not be a good idea to do away with the child at an early stage?

Practically sure, but morally? I don't think so. Why does this not extend to babies after birth? Your line of argumentation opens the door to getting rid of whole classes of people. We are overpopulated, after all. Why not get rid of old people? They are at a late stage and about to die anyway.

Plus, what if your parents had considered that? It's easy to say in the abstract, but I bet you would rather be alive and poor than not ever exist. I know I would.

My father actually died when I was very young. My brother and I were raised by my mother, alone. We had a tough time financially speaking. Still, I am grateful for life. If my mother could see that future and know that it would be difficult, I would hope that she would make the sacrifice regardless.

&gt; For me, it ethically became highly problematic as soon as she woke up. If she would've been helped while asleep, the situation would have been different for me and no one would have objected probably. The doctor might also not have been prosecuted.

That's an interesting and (I hope) rare case. For me it seems problematic because she withdrew consent. (or at least appeared to)

&gt; You were succesful in broadening my view! I considered this exchange of ideas to be worth the effort, no doubts about that. I have come to understand your position much better as well.

I will reflect on what was said above, including the few inconsistencies you exposed on my side. I might want to reconsider certain parts of my position after this exchange.

the greens think 60k is very likely. because there are some strict rules on who is allowed to bring his family and who ""family"" includes. as far as i know it includes usually wife/husband/children. not parents unless there is an unusual severe case that has to be decided by courts.

no one realy knows.

butthere is an interessting thing, there is already a law that regulates how family members can be brought legaly to germany. the last government paused it, i think until march 2018. if no action is taken the pre 2015 regulations are in work again.

i have heard a lot of interesting compromises on how to solve that issue. one of the best in my opinion would be to create a guideline on how many refugees we are able to accept per year and at the end allow family member to get in to germany untill that max number is reached.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7dwuro/german_coalition_talks_hanging_by_thread/dq19luc/,Darirol,1511069454

Here is just some more food for you to ponder

“We are socialists, we are enemies of today’s capitalistic economic system for the exploitation of the economically weak, with its unfair salaries, with its unseemly evaluation of a human being according to wealth and property instead of responsibility and performance, and we are all determined to destroy this system under all conditions.”
—Adolf Hitler,[144] 1927 speech

Socialism as the final concept of duty, the ethical duty of work, not just for oneself but also for one’s fellow man’s sake, and above all the principle: Common good before own good, a struggle against all parasitism and especially against easy and unearned income. And we were aware that in this fight we can rely on no one but our own people. We are convinced that socialism in the right sense will only be possible in nations and races that are Aryan, and there in the first place we hope for our own people and are convinced that socialism is inseparable from nationalism.

The common good before the individual good. 

Since we are socialists, we must necessarily also be antisemites because we want to fight against the very opposite: materialism and mammonism… How can you not be an antisemite, being a socialist!


Because it seems inseparable from the social idea and we do not believe that there could ever exist a state with lasting inner health if it is not built on internal social justice, and so we have joined forces with this knowledge.

There are no such things as classes: they cannot be. Class means caste and caste means race.


If the National Socialist Movement should fail to understand the fundamental importance of this essential principle [race], if it should merely varnish the external appearance of the present State and adopt the majority principle, it would really do nothing more than compete with Marxism on its own ground.

In our movement the two extremes come together: the Communists from the Left and the officers and students from the Right. These two have always been the most active elements.

The National Socialist Movement, on the contrary, will always let its foreign policy be determined by the necessity to secure the space necessary to the life of our Folk. It knows no Germanising or Teutonising, as in the case of the national bourgeoisie, but only the spread of its own Folk. It will never see in the subjugated, so called Germanised, Czechs or Poles a national, let alone Folkish, strengthening, but only the racial weakening of our Folk.
The Folkish State, conversely, must under no conditions annex Poles with the intention of wanting to make Germans out of them some day. On the contrary, it must muster the determination either to seal off these alien racial elements, so that the blood of its own Folk will not be corrupted again, or it must without further ado remove them and hand over the vacated territory to its own National Comrades.

**Our adopted term 'Socialist' has nothing to do with Marxian Socialism. Marxism is anti-property; true Socialism is not.**

To put it quite clearly: we have an economic programme. Point No. 13 in that programme demands the nationalisation of all public companies, in other words socialisation, or what is known here as socialism. … the basic principle of my Party’s economic programme should be made perfectly clear and that is the **principle of authority… the good of the community takes priority over that of the individual. But the State should retain control; every owner should feel himself to be an agent of the State; it is his duty not to misuse his possessions to the detriment of the State or the interests of his fellow countrymen. That is the overriding point. The Third Reich will always retain the right to control property owners.** If you say that the bourgeoisie is tearing its hair over the question of private property, that does not affect me in the least. Does the bourgeoisie expect some consideration from me?… Today’s bourgeoisie is rotten to the core; it has no ideals any more; all it wants to do is earn money and so it does me what damage it can. The bourgeois press does me damage too and would like to consign me and my movement to the devil.

1473,"&gt;Poland the eternal victim.
Poland was a victim in WW2, denying it is like denying the Holocaust. Although there were evil Poles and Jews, it wasn't the main national trend, unlike in Germany and Russia.

&gt;Poland before the war
Not during the war, but ok.

&gt;Przemysl
In Przemysl in 1918 there were constant fight between Poles and Ukrainians, there were Jewish casualities, but no definite pogrom. I believe you're talking about [1915 siege, and pogrom](https://books.google.pl/books?id=vJ2ttlZQw9cC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;lpg=PA123&amp;dq=pogrom+w+przemysl+1918&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SE0iKyzF-d&amp;sig=-G7p-uXjEbNrDwce-Iex-8eIwg4&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjn5cLjwsnXAhWDOBoKHc_cDBkQ6AEIQDAE#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false), which had nothing to do with us. Give some evidence in English if you have it. (I'm not repeating this).

&gt;Lwow
There are as many opinions as the authors. 22 of November 1918, the Polish Army captured Lwow. 60/71/150 Jews died that day (the highest number is Polish Ministry of Interior). 1.500 People were arrested for the incidents, and 60 sentenced to death. It can be said to be a pogrom. 439 Poles died that day, among which 6 were jewish, so you can add them to pogrom I guess.

&gt;Pinsk
5 April 1919, 1 month after the Polish victory. 35 Jews were shot in the back of their head. Luczynski believed they were a contraband, conspirators.

&gt;Lida
16-17 April 1919, day of the Polish victory. 39 Jews were executed, for shooting to the Polish soldiers.

&gt;Wilno
19-23 April 1919, day of the Polish victory. 50 Jews died as a consequence of unrest, and conspiration with Bolsheviks.

&gt; Minsk
No data. Give source.

If you are able to analyze then you can find that:

a) Executions of the Jews were well sporadic not ""popular""
b) Almost always were a consequence of on going war
c) Polish government was seeking justice, and even allowed Americans to investigate
d) They weren't caused by ideological anti-semitism
e) Jews weren't ever the main target 

I gave numbers just for Lwow. But there was much more Polish-Ukrainian casualities each of this days, although Jews weren't a minority in couplr of this cities.

&gt;Poland the eternal victim.

Let's not forget that neither are Jews.

Following the Rashidun Caliphate's conquest of Egypt, the people headed east, towards China, to get as far away from the Caliphate as possible. However they couldn't actually get into China because of the Great Wall, so they had to settle in Mongolia instead. There they slowly gathered their strength so that one day they might retake their homeland. Took them 600 years to gather enough forces for it. Unfortunately they got a bit lost during the return trip (the travel instructions left by their ancestors were a bit weird, and they didn't have compasses back then) and ended up taking Iran, Russia and Turkey and eventually settled in Finland instead. 

The name, ""Finland"", is actually a clue that this absolutely happened and isn't just something I cooked up by mixing history with a bit of fantasy.

Also, slavic languages (and a lot more) don't have articles, so knowing when to put one is a struggle. Due to that we often have tests completely dedicated to articles. We also don't use prepositions as much, due to having grammatical cases that do the job, so that can be confusing as well.

Since we're already an enemy of Iran it doesn't sell papers to say they are bad.

Saudi Arabia are liberalising. They are clamping down on terrorism. They are ISIS's biggest enemy. They no longer fund mosques around the world. [They have a new plan to defeat terrorism](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/saudi-arabia-terrorism-funding-214241):

* New limits on the ability of the religious police to arrest dissidents.
* Purges of extremists from the government and greater efforts to monitor their influence in security institutions.
* The appointment of new religious leaders to counter Islamic extremism on theological grounds.
* The transformation of the world Muslim League—a key Saudi arm for supporting Islamic movements abroad—by the appointment of a new leader and a decision to stop supporting Islamist madrassas abroad.

They're even covertly co-operating with Israel. And regardless, keeping them close is the best thing we can do. They have the 3rd richest military on the planet and are hugely powerful.

Oh really? You *suddenly* realized you are actually Finnish?


&gt; We found ourselves in a totally new situation where new institutions needed to be created, even though we tried to work with previous Swedish law and organization as far as possible. Especially after early liberal times of Alexander II were over, the possibilities for reforms stagnated in the end of the 19th century and then Russia started pushing russification in the 1900s.


I beg your pardon? You were conquered in 1809 and nobody had taken steps to russify you until 1899. Your cultural awakening had no obstacles set. Europe saw you music and poetry. You've had 90 years to develop your national identity without any interference from the Empire because, according to Alexander II, 'Finland never caused problems'.

And Bobrikov, who started the russification campaign in 1899, was shot in 1904 for that very reason. You even saw Russian being revoked as the national language.

&gt;Thirdly: IQ is...not really all good of a test. IQ is not a good predictor of success. It's not a good measure to begin with, intelligence is not a single trait, but at least 3. You can't reliably test for all 3 with a single score.

Alright, I respect your opinion, but that doesn't mean that IQ tests are bad measures for intelligence. SAT, PISA tests correlate heavily with the results from IQ tests after all. Not to mention we can see other factors come into play, such as income when there's no affirmative action in play.

Well in countries where tuition is free, *everyone* pays for students to get their degrees, not just the people getting the degrees like here. How is that any better? 


&gt; and overall you're just ballooning college numbers largely in unproductive fields, where the benefit of college attendance is questionable (nursing degrees?)


That's not the systems fault, that's the fault of people choosing to go to University and do the degrees they do. It's not like University is anymore mandatory here than in Germany. People can do what they want, it's just that we have a culture of University = success, so fewer people do apprenticeships. Can't blame the Uni debt system for that.


&gt; You're turning the university in a mass market, fund it by private loans, neglect the importance of entrepreneurship (gallup on this issue) at the expense of the people for which university really pays off. It's like the worst of all worlds.


Dude, that report is about the US.


University is hardly becoming a mass market in the UK. You go to University, get a loan, get a job and earn more. Seems like University pays off for students that do useful degrees.


There is a problem with the culture around it, we need more people doing apprenticeships, but again, that has absolutely NOTHING to do with student loans.


&gt; All of this has been documented for millennials. They are highly educated, are completely mismatched for the labour market


Once again, culture. Nothing to do with student loans. It's up to the students to choose a degree that is in demand, can't blame the student loan system for all the dipshits taking useless art degrees.


&gt; And this issue is most pronounced in the US and the UK, where under pretense of egalitarianism this privatisation of university has been happening for decades.


And yet British and American universities are the best in the world. Funny that.

They do, and we would have a lot more to lease out

&gt; Each member has a veto

Which there are whispers about getting rid of. But the point is it's very easy to move closer to the EU, but impossible to step back without leaving entirely, a pro-integration government could bind a successive anti-integration one.

&gt;  Besides it can be easily argued that moving towards that is a good thing

Not here it can't, that argument is well and truly lost as was proven by the Remain camp focusing on the difficulty of leaving rather than the benefits of unity.

&gt; It is also not for the same reason as the UK they are have pretty small population and are fairly specialized economies

Mind expanding on this? Would be interested to hear why they are immune from the ""follow all the rules with no say"" argument.

They're not, your link shows two sides are swapping their lead every few months and 4% is hardly grounds to reverse anything, in fact the most recent result makes an even draw possible within the margin of error.

Of course, people's choices are shaped by the frameworks institutions put up.

A public, tax funded system like in Germany or Denmark or wherever has the strong incentive to immediately reduce costs. They simply have way less money to spend as a result of getting their budget out of the public purse.

It was a well oiled policy to slap a orthodox church in the most prominent and symbolic places in the occupied cities, reduce their cultural and administrative autonomy, deny them the use of their language,etc.

Finland was fine for 50 years thanks to the separation of the Grand duchy from the bulk of Russian empire. But as time went by, its autonomy was more and more challenged by the tsarist elite and denying Finland's historical links with Sweden was a way to impose Russianness in its place.

Dude what?

Our histories are completely intermingled.

Both were allied against foreign invasions during the medieval period, later on the nobility kept ties, a Serb was once a ban of Croatia and two Croats were Despots of Serbia.

Croats fought at Kosovo and Serbs fought at the battle of Una.

1840,"&gt;You should have thought of that before the referundum. You created this problem, you will either solve it on your end or face the consequences (no trade deal).

The point is that the UK won't put a border in. That might mean no deal, but even if it does, there'd still be no border.

&gt;You're probably right, but your internal politics doesn't concern us anymore. Again, your doing, you'll bear the cost of your exit. That's pretty much EU's stance since the day after the referundum.

Which is great, but at the same time, the EU and UK want things from each other.  If the EU decides that it can't move forward without there being a border between constituent parts of the UK then fair enough, but the UK isn't going to agree to it, so we end up with no deal. Of course the EU and UK will still need to deal with the customs issues..

&gt;If the UK keep its hard stance and refuse compromise, I could see a dirty brexit, an UK completly pushed aside and considered an outcast in Europe. Give that 20 years of economic crash and your whole ""union of kingdoms"" will be in peril.

You foresee, based on what? There are models out there for a no-deal brexit. None of them predict a 20 year economic crash (none of them get close to the 2008 crash...). A no-deal exit would be a pain in the arse, it'd be less than ideal, but it is not, in any way an existential risk to the UK.

The decision to waste 3 months in Vukovar was a political one, not a military one. The city wasn't supposed to be attacked at all, and the military put together a pretty decent offensive plan, that was disregarded. 

The decision to fight in the city meant that we threw away a lot of our advantage and played to your strengths. It makes no sense at all.

Why do you think that is?

I've been trying to make sense of that war, and I just can't. That is, I've mostly narrowed down the how's and why's from our side, but Slobo&amp;co don't make sense.

IF they were trying to ""rescue the oppressed Serbian minority"", it makes no sense to half-ass it. IF they were trying to keep Croatia in Yugo, or simply trying to annex parts (more likely IMO, I think everyone understood Yugoslavia is dead), it still makes no sense to half-ass it.

Did they... what, underestimate us? But the narrative was ""omg scary Croats will genocide Serbs"", makes no sense again. On the other hand, if they figured we're pushovers, such a shoddy battle-plan is still pushing it. 

Sometimes I go like ""well there were a lot of desertions in JNA, Slobo had to *make do* with not-that-competent volunteers"", but this command to waste time on Vukovar came from the top, no? And then sometimes I think he knew or thought he knew things we don't, like - take that weapon's embargo from UN. I guess you could interpret that ""wise"" decision as ""international community gives carte blanche to JNA"", like maybe he got assurances that he can freely ""kill that rebellion"" however he sees fit, but even with that, I don't know how he thought that shelling Dubrovnik and leveling Vukovar would make JNA/Serbs look like the *good/righteous guys*.

1984,"No, the easiest way is blaming other nations like Hilter did, and like majority of Croats do. If you talk about flowers, how come that civilians of Zagreb put flowers on Nazi tanks. But forgive me for saying that irrelevant thing(for this discussion).  

First lets start from the beginning. The root of Croat-Serbian problem starts way back in the middle ages. Croatian Slavs were catholic and Serbian Slavs were orthodox which created a border between them, and clashes were regular. The real problem began back in WWI and WWII when Croats fought against Serbs and Montenegrins (WWI) and when Croats hailed Nazis as liberators, created Ustasha state NDH and started the mass execution of Serbs.  

Second part of the problem is communist propaganda. Now let me say this, part of Chetnik troups were what we call war criminals and murderers, but all their crimes pale in comparison to Ustasha. Now for Tito to be able to create atmosphere for ""Brotherhood and Unity"" he had to make sure to make Chetnik and Ustasha crimes equal. He forgot many of Ustasha and Chetnik crimes and decided to hide the truth. Basically he wrote the history the way he wanted.  

Now let us get back to our subject here. The Constitution of Yugoslavia from 1970s made it clear that one of the Yugoslav states can separate from Yugoslavia only if it has permission from other states. So if Slovenia wanted to separate, they would need permision from Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia and Montenegro. Slovenia wasn't the problem. Croatia and Bosnia were.  

For Croatia to separate, they needed the support not only from other states, but also from Serb minority living in Croatia. This was made to prevent incidents from WWII. Bosnia on the other hand, needed support from Serb and Croat people to separate. This was not the case and that's why Croats started to illegally arm themselves back in 89'. I say ""illegally"" because Yugoslavia already had an army.  

Although that is reason enough to start the war I tell you, it's not why the war started. Tudjman, Milosevic and Izetbegovic were all politician scum that wanted power. Nobody wanted to share the power in Yugoslavia they all wanted ""crowns"" on their heads. The only way for Yugoslav people to go to war is to stir up old hatred. They saw that country burn and they became kings of the ashes. So don't be stupid man, don't belive HRT and politicians.

The number of Serb soldiers you're working with here is greater than the whole population of Vukovar. Obviously, only a fraction of that was involved in the actual fighting, the majority was simply a blocking force, or not doing anything.

&gt; Just for comparison, Croatian army during entire Operation Storm had less armor and artillery support with 3:1 advantage in infantry.

That's because the defenders ran away.

I was left for an hour waiting for a legitimate explanation and i all i got back was a simple “no you can not board the plane with that document” and that was told by an EasyJet travel agent , because the border police did not even show up.  I got rejected even though when i purchased my plane ticket i choose “Greek Nationality ID” on the online form they requested , and yet i was not flagged or warned that i can not fly from Kosovo with that particular ID !!

Well that's the whole point of the article : You tell the UK that either they put the border in the Irish sea or The UK gets no transition, no deal and become an outcast in Europe. Ireland can do just that, they can veto any upcoming deal between Brussels and London.

&gt;  The EU can't force anything.

It's not the EU, it's Ireland.

If Ireland want to stay in the EU and its single-market, they'll have the requirement to control their borders.

In the normal process, the rebate isn't directly repayed but offset against the British budget contribution in the following year.

The outstanding rebate repayment is an outstanding financial obligation the same way that the British share of outstanding liabilities (commitments under the current MFF, long term commitments to some projects, pension liabilities, etc.) is.

If Britain wants the rebate repayment, they're going to make good on their obligations, too.

If Britain agrees to cover all outstanding commitments and the following negotiations are only about the exact way the figure is calculated, the outstanding rebate repayment would obviously be offset against that figure.

If the UK wants to negotiate on the obligations themselves (seeking to pay only some of the obligations or to negotiate a rebate on the final figure) then the rebate repayment would be part of that negotiation and the EU obviously wouldn't commit to the repayment until those negotiations are concluded.

2233,"&gt; Either an EU-UK deal is reached that somehow avoids a 'true' hard border, or there will be a hard border across Ireland with the UK crashing out of the EU with no deal.

I think you are missing the third option, that has been asked by Brussels from the scratch : that Ireland gets a special solution that does not apply to the rest of the UK.

Whatever EU-UK deal is reach, it will have a border, unless the UK decide to drop all its demands (make its own trade agreement, remove the ECJ from its affairs) which isn't going to happens.

So the really options actually are this : 

- Either the UK accept that there is no boders between N.I. and Ireland and that means that the border move into the Irish Sea.

- The UK refuse that and then Ireland veto any future deal with the UK, the transition included. That's cliff jumping, dirty brexit.

In any case, The EU has no say in either really.

&gt; The guy you're replying to understands the reality here: a hard border is already very likely, and this move just makes it pretty much 100% likely.

All the UK has to do is to accept borders checks in Belfast controlled by the EU, accept to pay 50 billions over 10 years, grant EU's citizens decent (and mutual) rights to get an 18 months transition that will lead to a Canadian style FTA.

This seams defenetly fair for everyone but from abroad, it looks like the british are suicidal at this point.

The reason lies half a century or more in the past, when Gorbachev's undoubtedly genius idea of outdoing the States in meat and milk production led to the eradication of a large part of our already not so populous cattle. A lot of agriculture in general was lost during the dissolution, too. These days we still can't meet the numbers required for self-sufficiency on cows, so it is how it is. That, and if I recall everything correctly from that one radio interview on the topic, no one even bothers to produce high-quality milk required for quality cheese here.

Maybe they get relocated some batteries before, in the training process, with the old BCS ? Either way, they're requesting offsets too which seems to add into the hefty costs of the project but will invigorate the arms industry. I'm really curious how they'll implement this offset and for what components. Romania will probably not get any meaningful offsets, though I recall my ministry saying we'll build the trucks for the launchers. I'm fine with that since our country is in desperate need of air defense capabilities.

During the battle, shells and rockets were fired into the town at a rate of up to 12,000 a day.[7] At the time, it was the fiercest and most protracted battle seen in Europe since 1945, and Vukovar was the first major European town to be entirely destroyed since the Second World War.[8][9] When Vukovar fell on 18 November 1991, several hundred soldiers and civilians were massacred by Serb forces and at least 20,000 inhabitants were expelled.[10] Most of Vukovar was ethnically cleansed of its non-Serb population and became part of the self-declared Republic of Serbian Krajina. Several Serb military and political officials, including Milošević, were later indicted and in some cases jailed for war crimes committed during and after the battle.

You’re sacrificing your security for cheap labor, passing the buck of what needs to be done (mass expulsions) to future generations that will hate you. Muslims are evidently more steadfast in their own values than you are to your own (maintenance of a liberal/secular society); you’re not going to change them. I see either mass expulsions occurring, you guys hunkering down in fortified European/secular communities, or your states eventually becoming wholly Islamic.

2607,"&gt; The comments are certain to fan the flames of the debate sparked by the education secretary, Michael Gove, about whether Britain's role in the war should be seen as heroic courage or monumental error.

&gt; Gove, in an article in the Daily Mail, attacked ""leftwing academics all too happy to feed those myths by attacking Britain's role in the conflict"", and decried the Blackadder portrayal of the war as ""a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out-of-touch elite"".

It is noteworthy that Gove, who is one of the architects of Brexit, also promoted WWI as a heroic war, which must not be questioned even today, even by parody like Blackadder:

My point being here is that for this sort of change to happen in order for Scotland and NI to remain, much as I would like that, it would require a deep change to the constitutional law of the UK, one that alters its fundamental makeup of a central union that would be unacceptable to quite many on the streets and on reddiit here.

[What do you think the pilgrims ate?](https://i.imgur.com/2nOjZDG.png)

&gt;A common problem with large birds is that European ovens are too small to accommodate anything bigger than a standard chicken.

Bullshit. I don't believe this for one bit. These people got stuck with a toaster oven or something and got told that's the standard EU size by their snickering landlord. Your average 60cm oven should fit most birds just fine, and even a 50cm would do. Even if they're stuck with a toaster oven, I've found that there are places which will cook your meat for you, so even that's an option.

&gt;Meanwhile, Jeanne Matthey is on a hunt for an organic pumpkin puree in Budapest, Hungary, so she can bake a pie for Thanksgiving but time is running out. Last year, the Chicago native scooped, boiled and blended two pumpkins. It “was a laborious process that I don’t want to go through again,” she said.

How do you think pumpkin pie is usually made!? You boil the damn thing and just smash it with an immersion blender. That's a laborious process? Have you ever made this complicated dish called... soup?

&gt;The other typical foods for the uniquely American holiday also are hard to come by — particularly ingredients for pumpkin pie and yam soufflé. 

So... flour, pumpkin, milk, sugar? Oh right, they were looking for premade pie crust, canned pumpkin and whipped cream. Oh, and I can buy yams in the shittiest part of my neighborhood in Serbia, you just need to learn that they're not called ""yams"" here. If you really can't find it in a store, you can order it online.

Holy fuck people, this is a special day of the year for you Americans, why the hell are you opening cans and scooping out crap? Get the family and friends together and cook stuff the way it's supposed to be cooked!

You are aware Bismarck's rule was one of the most peaceful in Europe, right? He played the key role in unifying Germany and creating a balance of power against the French which had been the war monger of the century. He was able to unite differing Princes to see their common interest in a United State. He also helped avoid an ever bigger European war with the with his Berlin congresses.

So yes, I do think German would be better thinking like Bismarck, in focusing on our common problems, and how to Unite Europe whilst maintaining the balance of power, and providing the world's first welfare state.

&gt;How about recognizing that is exactly the point. When you live in a state you give up potential liberty for applicable liberty. You can't become a local warlord, but you do have more day to day freedom as a person in civil society.

&gt;Same with the EU. It's original mission was to prevent Germany from ever getting as powerful again, through taking control of their raw resources, agriculture, currency, and even political independence away from them. Germany is a shadow of how strong it would be in a ""dog eat dog"" Europe.

&gt;We give up being empires, and admit that being together and peaceful is better. And for everyone, those able of becoming empires and those unable, it's a good deal.

So how about those who want to be part of the EU do that, and those who don't, but are quite happy to have decent relationships with the EU, the US, China and others do that? I mean, what is the benefit of being part of a grouping in which your individual interests are diluted, and one that seems to have interests divergent to your own? If the EU is supposed to be a counter balance to the likes of the US, how does that work if you are a close ally of the US? Same goes for China, what is the point in being part of a union that eyes China suspiciously when you'd actually like to see better and deeper trade and social ties?

The EU works if you take a regional outlook and view the US and China as hostile and in need of being countered.  Frankly though, that sounds like trying to re-invent the age of empires rather than looking for real, global cooperation.

Right now you could argue that we probably have as much in common with an American in NY or a Hong Kong Chinese person in Kowloon as we do with a Bulgarian in Sofia or a Spaniard in Madrid, so why look toward Europe over a more global outlook?

I'm referring to this case: https://www.demorgen.be/binnenland/zo-simpel-is-inbreken-in-doel-anja-hermans-deed-het-12-keer-b8639037/

An activist entered a nuclear power plant 12 times. She made a report and forwarded it to the manager. Her reward? She got sued, put in prison, and the security didn't improve.

&gt;However, storing leak-sensitive waste in an undrained (and probably undrainable) saltmine is pretty damned stupid. 

I agree, and that's the problem: no matter whether it's technically possible to do it safely, it's going to be people who handle the damn things and they'll fuck up, sooner or later.

&gt;Over 99% of the actual radioactivity at the Asse-II facility comes from the less-than 10 kilos of spent fuel also stored on site. THAT is dangerous, which is why it's (vitrified?) in specialized containers, and not just in yellow barrels in a big pile.

**Scotland** - They just had a vote where they decided to continue taking decisions with the rest of the UK, and the history, protection and money of the rest of the UK comes with the rest of the UK's politics, and no, ""and the UK promises to stay in the EU forever"" was not on the ballot.

[""No"" maintains a 10 point lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_second_Scottish_independence_referendum#Opinion_polling) which has only been growing following a post-Brexit vote bump to Yes. 

The SNP lost seats in both the [UK general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2017) and [Scottish elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_local_elections,_2017) earlier this year, the biggest winner in both these elections? Those evil, pro-UK, pro-Brexit Tories.

Also, England hasn't said anything, it can't as it has no parliament, the UK government (which currently only governs with the support of Northern Irish and Scottish MPs) hasn't even said no, it's said ""how about you wait longer than 3 years since the last one and after the biggest constitutional challenge our civil service has ever faced""

**Northern Ireland** - NI can [leave the UK whenever it wants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement), except, guess what, it doesn't, [""22% of respondents favourable towards reunification""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Ireland#Northern_Ireland)

I get that it's frustrating to not get what you want, but Scotland and NI are 8% and 3% of the UK's population, they don't get to overrule the other 89%, especially not when that 89% has shown themselves to be fine with that 11% leaving if they want to (so long as it's not purposefully done at a time that would fuck them over).

You know what really pisses me off about all this ""England wants to fuck over Scotland and NI"" crap? **England doesn't give a shit**, honestly, I've found nothing but complete apathy here towards the prospect of another part leaving the UK.

Well yes. That's the general idea. The UK is leaving the EU because there is a difference in outlook. I don't think the UK is unique in that, but it has clearly decided to move in a different direction. That's great.

&gt;Tell us how it goes when the US buries your high tech industries like it's trying with Bombardier and China floods out your markets. 

You realise the US buys quite a lot from those UK high tech industries and that there is a lot of collaboration right, indeed that the UK does pretty well globally in those areas?  

As to China, you are aware that some of the things the EU pushed to 'protect' EU businesses from Chinese exports were bad for UK consumers and industry right? If a country can produce steel far more cheaply than you can, and you are quite a large consumer of steel, and not much of a producer (because other EU countries have governments that subsidise their production for example..) then cheap steel is good. Oh and when it comes to complex metallurgy, the UK seems to manage fairly well, because that is high tech and complex, and the UK is pretty good at that.

&gt;We might be busy setting out the standards you have to follow,but don't take it for a lack of interest in the outcome.

2912,"&gt;I live that reality too. I live in Europe. A place where people still promote Nazi and racist ideologies in efforts to maintain the purity of their nations and cultures even though the Holocaust happened in their very nations. This backlash is about racial purity, xenophobia, and Islamophobia. Nothing more.

Well, do Polish have problem with Japanese immigrants, how about Chinese? How about do the Hungarians have problem with those immigrants? Maybe the problem lies not with racial purity but rather people not wanting detrimental immigration. Do you see Poles or any Europeans marching against Japanese or Chinese? If they do so for singular group, and that's reoccurring in many, many different countries and cultures across the globe, maybe it's time to look why they're marching against them?

How about you yourself try moving to a country where the racial purity, xenophobia or Islamophobia aren't as in so big role? Maybe you should try find perspective from Africa or from Middle-East if you think Europeans should live with all that, because every poll shows that most Europeans do not want MENA or Islamic immigration no more.

I live in very reality where it's becoming increasingly more clear that it's not going to work out, my country, Finland, is very tiny country but it's pretty safe and wealthy country, but it's small. We have annual budget of 55 billion Euros, but the immigration from non-western countries is already eating billions of Euros from that budget, merely handling the situation in 2015 cost us 700M and that's only one year. Not to mention it's become crystal clear that the situation is not getting better, we have data from 2nd gen immigrants from non-western countries you know. It's already 30 years since this all madness started in Finland, and it's not looking better for us at this pace.

How on Earth you think this all will end? Do you think it's going to get better, when it hasn't for past 50 years for any western countries? What exactly makes you think that?

---|---
Where are you from? | The cold, dark frozen lands of Norway.
What languages can you speak fluently? | English and Norwegian, so Swedish is easily understood. No one understands Danish. 
What is your usual timezone? | Central European Time
Are you willing to use [Slack](https://slack.com) and [Toolbox](https://www.reddit.com/r/toolbox/)? | Already use Toolbox for moderation.
Have you had previous experience as a mod inside or outside of reddit? | Am currently a moderator of /r/norge, biggest Norwegian sub. In the past, I did my fair share of ""patroling"" and contribution to [no.wikipedia](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruker:MarlinMr), and I played a small part in the formation of the current /r/norge-discord. 
What do you think about the the current state of /r/europe? What do you like/dislike? | What I like the most about the sub is the cultural flow that arises. A European community that is diverse, yet closely connected. I do not like the way thumbnails on the page are displayed in different sizes. [/r/europe thumbnails](https://imgur.com/a/rRzHQ). Some are too big, and some are too small. This could easily be fixed by allowing a max height of the thumbnail.
What change would you make to /r/europe, if you could? | I think an idea similar to the Swedish /r/iksdagen would be a cool project. Basically they have created a online parlament that simulates the real Swedish parlament. It allows politically active redditors to have some fun and actually discuss political issues in a formal maner. 
Why do you think you would be a good addition to the /r/europe mod team? | Because I would be able to do *some* work. Nothing special about me. I will not revolutionize the way the sub is run. I will not greatly improve the sub. I will simply be able to do some work.
Do you think an Alfa Romeo is an average person's car? | No. I know no one who drives one, I hardly know what it is. Everyone here either drives a Golf or a Tesla.

All communism has done for us is created gulags killed millions of people and caused millions to starve. The same can be said to socialism look to Venezuela which is now starving. Even if you point to European countries you must concede the point that they are moving more towards capitalism as socialism continues to fail.

You seriously think 2 uprisings in 125 years makes you freedom fighters? 
Especially with both of them failing. And the funniest bit is that those two uprisings were mainly polish, you were basically just sidekicks, if that.  

&gt;And yeah... Soviets didn't even bother to rusify Lithuania even a single bit, there is a reason we don't have huge Russian population. Mostly due to Lithuanian partisans who fought Soviet occupation and leaders of LSSR who again showed middle finger to Stalin when it came to policies he didn't perceive as valuable to Lithuania.

A big middle finger that was, if you stayed under Soviets until the end.

Estoy de acuerdo y lo sé que el hecho de que nosotros marcharamos llevaría muchos problemas económicos al resto de España simplemente por el hecho de que el sistema está estructurado a partir de que nosotros formamos parte de España. 

Y ahora te voy a decir un poco como lo vemos muchos nuestra relación con el resto de España. Y es que ha llegado un punto en el que creo que nos vemos tan odiados por el resto de España que a muchos les da igual y es un sentimiento de si nos odian porque vamos a seguir con ellos? Por que nos retienen contra nuestra voluntad si tanto nos odian? Ese mismo odio dices que vosotros habeis percibido, nosotros también pero enfocado a nosotros. Es un tema muy jodido es como el odio crea mas odio y mas odio y parece que de ahí no se sale. 

Yo sinceramente creo que España es un pais que en muchos territorios está muy atrasado y es imposible salir de esta dinámica en la que hemos entrado así que creo que la única salida es la independéncia. Tu no sabes con que rabia y con que cara habla mi madre cuando ve ciertas cosas en contra de nosotros de verdad que se puede notar como viene des de dentro de su corazón y creo que eso ya no se puede cambiar (ni por parte nuestra ni de vosotros) y yo creo que Rajoy está salvando por la fuerza una relación que se ha muerto. 

Tio y me sabe bastante mal porque sé lo jodido que puede ser esto para algunos, pero de verdad que da mucha rabia el menosprecio que se nos tiene a nosotros también, que cuando yo voy a Aragón a mi pueblo toda la gente mayor nos tiene rabia y a la minima que mi primo hace alguna gamberrada ya se nos echan encima (por poner algun ejemplo).

I don't want to give you much flack for you comment. But I just wanted to state that language means alot for people. The concept of retaining a language has spawned independence movements and the birth of new nations not just in Europe but across the world. National and language is important to keep a cohesive community and to hold an own identity, and not be erased to a larger, potentially foreign power/group. We all want to feel safe and flock into a group that regards each other as equals in our own community and language also plays a big part of that.

&gt;Also, your tall buildings don't help, either. Look at asian countries: Tokyo and big Chinese cities draw millions of people in and the room still is insufficient

Seriously? HOw much worse do you think the situation would be if they didn't have highrises? Like think a bit about it, the highrises help a lot.

&gt;You don't get to trample peoples' heritages and history to dust to make room for depressing concrete and glass monsters

I don't get this argument, what do you mean heritage? Do you think when they bulldozed the even older buildings they thought ""we will build these new buildings and they will stand forever, the country shall never change, and humanity has basicly ended now"".

Monsters like this http://c8.alamy.com/comp/F748K5/window-washer-on-highrise-near-empire-state-building-nyc-usa-F748K5.jpg ?

It's not a single case. Serials killers also aren't outliers. And no, you can base your ""sense of safety"" in whatever you want, doesn't need to be grounded in fact, reason or reality even. You can claim angels are watching over you and so you feel safe.

3268,"Well, you're asking a whopper of a question there but I'll try to stay on point.

The problem with the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland is that, ever since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, people in Northern Ireland have the right to either a British passport, an Irish passport or both. So essentially, you will have a high percentage of people in Northern Ireland who, while living in a ""state"" that is not a part of the EU, they will be EU citizens themselves by virtue of their Irish passports.

Also, the ""Agreement"" part of the Good Friday Agreement is misleading, what it really is is a peace treaty between opposing factions in Northern Ireland, and also the British state. This means that the Agreement requires a certain level of cooperation between all actors (British government, Irish government and Northern Irish parties) for it to be maintained. A hard border suddenly popping up, possibly manned by British soldiers or officers, is an obvious obstacle to that. 

Not to mention that the regression back to having British troops manning the border, something that hasn't happened since the conflict ended, will not be something that a lot of people will want to either see or be reminded of.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/7d9fa1/the_netherlands_braces_for_a_hard_brexit/dpyisex/,08TangoDown08,1510927994

This is where a lot of the, well, Prague café talk for the lack of a better term starts to lose me, because more often than not the ""more"" isn't meant as ""let's stop ignoring our deficiencies in human values, and fix them while also fixing our material situation""; it's usually ""why should we worry about such plebian things as economy or jobs or welfare when there's moral nirvana to be achieved? Being considered a morally superior nation should be enough of a solace even to the poorest, no?""

There's a lot of truth in saying that our president exploits the divides between social strata and makes them worse by pitting people against each other, but honestly, most intellectuals really aren't helping any and do themselves no favour when they refuse to take the ""lowly"" material concerns of under-educated, not really well-off classes seriously and act all baffled as to how anyone could/should possibly give a fuck.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/7dkcey/sociologist_many_of_the_basic_values_heralded_in/dpyiv60/,eastern_garbage_bin,1510928094

I guess I'm a bit taken aback. If people had died as part of an effort to keep my people from starving, I think I would feel the need to honor their sacrifice.

&gt; I'm not disputing that it was generous from the US or good for Germany, but the US didn't do it because of selflessness.

The canadians refused to contribute to the airlift on the grounds that it might start a war with russia. And even if you want to ascribe it all to selfishness, shouldn't it be comforting to think that the US's selfishness seems to express itself in ways that are beneficial to germany?

&gt; It's also vastly overstated how much the US aid did for Europe. It wasn't really that much.

Oh man, I really suggest you do some research. Not only did deferring these debts literally stop the british economy from collapsing, but you need to understand the dire state of Russian industry at the start of Barbarossa.

Forgetting about the tens of thousands of vehicles the US sent, the real key was how much *fuel* the US was providing. 58% of Russia's aviation fuel with US supplied. Surely you can see how that *significantly* affected Russia's ability to operate an airforce?

US supplies accounted for 53% of Russia's ammunition, 93% of their railroad equipment including cars and locomotives. Don't agree with me? How about Nikita Kruschev and Stalin?

&gt; ""I would like to express my candid opinion about Stalin’s views on whether the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany and survived the war without aid from the United States and Britain. First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were ""discussing freely"" among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, and we would have lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don't think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, that is what he said. When I listened to his remarks, I was fully in agreement with him, and today I am even more so.""",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7dd0ho/germany_replaces_us_as_country_with_best/dpyeb2s/,SuperObviousShill,1510920576

I already told you that it was primarily an effort against the USSR, not because the US wanted to do good.

&gt;
The canadians refused to contribute to the airlift on the grounds that it might start a war with russia. And even if you want to ascribe it all to selfishness, shouldn't it be comforting to think that the US's selfishness seems to express itself in ways that are beneficial to germany?

Never said anything different. I'm saying that you shouldn't be surprised if people don't see you as the Messiah because you did something good as a side effect of something which purpose was to increase US influence.


&gt;Oh man, I really suggest you do some research. Not only did deferring these debts literally stop the british economy from collapsing, but you need to understand the dire state of Russian industry at the start of Barbarossa.
Forgetting about the tens of thousands of vehicles the US sent, the real key was how much fuel the US was providing. 58% of Russia's aviation fuel with US supplied. Surely you can see how that significantly affected Russia's ability to operate an airforce?
US supplies accounted for 53% of Russia's ammunition, 93% of their railroad equipment including cars and locomotives. Don't agree with me? How about Nikita Kruschev and Stalin?

We are talking about why the US aid isn't seen as favourably as you might hope in Germany. What happened in Britain or Russia etc. is quite irrelevant.

3369,"Well we could say everything is both a choice and not. We're operating on not just our own consciousness - the reason we crave things is not because you consciously, say, want a Coca-Cola after seeing a Coca-Cola commercial, but because our underlying systems - say - even just the way how we were raised, our genetics - basically brainwashes us. For example -
 do you consciously love someone, or do you love them because your subconscious forces you to do it?

When you're drowning the body takes over and, if the lifeguard/person who tries to save you is not careful, you can murder the other person. When people in Leningrad between 1941 and 1944 were starving, they resorted to cannibalism. During Caesars wars in Gaul, a hilltop city under seige threw out all the women, children and elderly in order to make sure that the warriors could continue the seige. Some people are capable of murdering others to save their close family. 

We view the world from an extremely egocentric view, because we, other than using empathy, have literally no way how to feel the pain or emotions of others. In my opinion criminals are three kinds of people - those who have empathy, but feel that their actions will not harm others, those who lack empathy, and hence don't care that their actions will harm others (for an example, think of a typical psycopath murderer or a ''thug''), and those who don't lack empathy, but feel that their actions are necessary. 

And these feelings about what is or is not necessary, as I said in the beggining, might not just be in our control at all. The sweetest dog, cornered, threatened and hurt, will bite. The most sucidial person can, when standing at the edge of the abyss, turn around because of an instinctual fear of death, and this is also a subconscious process.

3442,"&gt; We actually have experience with Arabs in Denmark and statistics show they cost us a lot of money and have abysmal rates for employment, why is it xenophobic to draw conclusion from that and try with a different kind of migrants this time Mexicans or Ukrainians for example.

Simply because it's supposes all Arabs/Mexicans/Ukrainians are alike and istead of assessing an applicant according to his individual CV. Also because ethnic,religious and other forms of discrimination aren't neutral. 

&gt;You talk of individual liberties, but people aren't entitled to move to Europe it's a privileged and some groups aren't worth the hassle.

Sure, states aren't supposed to accept everyone but they should have criteria that assesses the applicant and not if he's muslim, black or anything else.

&gt;Sure real refugees exist and I'm all for helping them I just want it done as close to their home country as possible because of two reasons, firstly is much more expensive to help them here also its very difficult to force them to leave once they are here.

That's fair but it would be logical had it been the case before 2015. Now that because precisely Europe didn't act and refugee camps in neighbouring countries didn't have minimal conditions the migrant crisis started. And with that reality even then member states like Poland or Hungary didn't care on semblance of a coordinated strategy. 

&gt;I'm being completely legit and honest here, you shouldn't label people trolls/far right/xenophobic just because you don't agree with them.

The SPD's stance is not that it is extracting debt, but that it is using measures against a government shielding billions of euros from proper taxation. This is perfectly consistent with their own self-image.

For one last time, I will mention that I neither support nor condemn the SPD's actions.

&gt;I would argue that since Greece has no place being in the Eurozone and entered through subterfuge without meeting the requirements the rest of Europe has no moral obligation to help them out of the hole they dug.

Sure, that would be the case if they hadn't allowed them to join or if the EU hadn't decided to help them.

3637,"&gt; What am I misinterpreting? You're literally saying 'Irish people descended from British settlers shouldn't be allowed to vote'

I'm simply saying not North Ireland but Ireland should vote. I don't care about settlers or ancestry. I just don't think a vote of people you brought there to annex a part of the country would give any relevant result. Its like asking a robber who stole a handbag and killed your grandparents in the process: ""Would you like to keep it""? What does it matter if he stole it almost 100 years ago and inherited it to his children?  Especially after you worked SO hard to strengthen their British identity.

&gt; The difference is that neither you nor I endorse that genocide. But you're endorsing segregated voting rights.

I endorse to let the people who were robbed to vote if they want their country back. You endorse to ask the robbers if they want to keep their booty.

You also endorse to ignore genocide as a relevant reason why the Irish should vote, and not North Ireland. The Irish were the ones killed and displaced. Their country was the one stolen.

3752,"&gt;Again, no, they didn't. Can you read?

My mistake, I misread.

&gt;It was a question. Has it ever crossed you mind that you might be mistaken, not us? I'm guessing that it actually never has.

Why are you making this a us vs them issue?

First of all you cannot be right or mistaken because your life means literally nothing to the US. Please stop acting like you are in a governmental position or some kind of official. You are not a policy-maker. No.

You got triggered on the Internet by comments like ""America is way more dangerous than Europe"", so you looked for studies confirming your position even when the data is shite and definitely not sufficient to base a whole world view on them like you actually do.

&gt;Based on your comments, I doubt you would be aware of this, but black Canadians are more over-incarcerated than black Americans. There's nothing particularly special about the incarceration rate of black people in our prisons as compared to the incarceration rate of the general population. You don't even know how over-incarcerated they are in Europe because most of your countries keep no records of the race of inmates. But 2/3 of Germans approve of racial profiling, something we've banned for years, so I think that when someone finally does look into it, the results may surprise you.

Funny how you first said you didn't care enough to debate this subject and now you are reading through my comment history to find anything useful hahahah.

&gt;You don't even know how over-incarcerated they are in Europe because most of your countries keep no records of the race of inmates

Yep, and if we did and we indeed would find out that blacks are over-incarcerated... holy shit, you would be so happy, wouldn't you? Afterall, for you this is only a nationalistic dick-measuring contest.

&gt;But 2/3 of Germans approve of racial profiling, something we've banned for years, so I think that when someone finally does look into it, the results may surprise you.

Good job, you googled ""Germany structural racism"", probably hoping this will show me. Don't forget to wrap it up in as much condescension as possible.

Anyway, racial profiling is banned in Germany and also per EU law. And suddenly a fucking YouGov Poll literally done two weeks after New Year's Eve when one year ago hundreds of women were sexually assaulted makes Germany racist? The question they asked is literally ""How do you rate the police operation this New Year's Eve in Cologne?"". I'm actually pretty sure that at least 95% of this country don't even know what racial profiling is because unlike the US we don't have a 250 years history of slavery and racism. But good on the US that they banned racial profiling already years ago. That police officers don't give a fuck has apparently never crossed your mind. I'm guessing that it actually never has.

Whatever. Google search for ""USA structural racism"". The results may surprise you, though.

Why? Thats not a counter argument. It just means you HAVE no counter argument. Borders were drawn and they  can be redrawn. Oh no, the map changes by a couple meters, big whoop...

The EU cant just veto that. Thats rediculous. Thats essentially an internal affair.

They excluded homicides from total crimes. Why did they do this?

&gt;Yes. It turns out that actually locking up criminals may help reduce crime.

I was just kinda shocked because I expected something, well, more amazing than locking up literally millions of people. 

&gt;Has it ever occurred to you that maybe we have ""the highest incarceration rate in the world"" because yours are too low?

There is this misconception that just because Ukrainian got classified as East Slavic, it should be similar to Russian, but the analysis shows that it isn't. In fact, Bulgarian is lexically closer to Russian than Ukrainian.

The truth is that languages don't follow a hierarchical tree structure, like species do in the evolutionary tree. Languages constantly influence and are influenced by their neighbors; and since Ukrainian formed as a separate language during the times of the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth, on the territories of the said commonwealth, it's no surprise that it's close to Polish, not Russian.

A resident of Transcarpathia Violetta Makedon, who in 2016 became the teacher of the year in Ukraine, went to work in Europe.

There for her great prospects, there, she said, she could better realize herself. Especially because she is still young and she is expecting good prospects. According to Violetta Makedon, there is nothing surprising in her departure, the decision she took was balanced and correct.

According to the young teacher, working conditions in Ukraine are unbearable. Labor is not valued, there is no development, and the prospects for teachers are very vague, both for the country itself.

Violetta says that in London she is paid for the day as much as in Ukraine came out in a month. Also, a young and promising teacher says she does not plan to return to such a Ukraine. Perhaps over time, yes, but not now, - ""Ukrainian realities"" with reference to elise.com.ua

Regarding London life, it stopped in one local family, which is engaged in photo business. The spouse is a local, and the wife is Ukrainian. Both are very busy, because there, according to Macedon, everyone is in constant movement and is working frantically, earning money.

The teacher of the year was instructed to take care of her grandfather named Bob, with whom she, according to a pre-designed plan, walks the capital, visits museums, theaters, parks, other landmarks in London and the like.

Also just for reference when I finished school around 10 years ago an tram A ticket (enough to go anywhere in the city) cost me 1,75Euros. Nowadays its almost 3 euros. Thats a huge amount of money for people on small incomes which depend its use to get around.

&gt; In 2014, of the 2,985 Ukrainian asylum applicants whose cases were processed in the European Union, only 150 were granted full refugee status; 2,335 were rejected; and the rest got other forms of protection — an acceptance rate of only 22 percent.

Maybe this is why, it's better for them to apply for a work visa then a refugee status. Since a war in Ukraine is not as important then what is happening in Africa or the ME.

Now it seems the d suffix (in this case ""ad"" suffix) was a diminutive one ... sort of like small fortress (but this is slightly disputed, it might be that it means Your Fortress).

Nagy was added later when the city was united under one administration in the 19th century (as many smaller areas sprung up around the fortress).

4100,"&gt; It's funny you say that, there's a popular satire program in Germany and one of it's primary topics is the United States both with domestic and foreign policy. 

I don't think that Die Anstalt primarily focuses on the US, they had 2-3 episodes that involved them but the vast majority of their stuff is germany/EU based, ofcourse the US is gonna come up, as you said yourself they are massively influential.

Beeing influential does not mean people will like you however, or that you are ""good"".

&gt;As a Canadian, I think culturally speaking the United States is one of the most influential in world history. I think scientifically too. I don't like it's military ambitions but Canada has no room to talk if we're being honest. And I think the US is in a major shit storm right now but overall, I disagree with many Americans and likely you too - I think America is a fucking great country. 

I do not disaggree, but beeing influential doesn't neccessarily mean beeing great.

Militarily e.g. the US has been extremely influential propping up dictators everywhere, but I wouldn't say that that makes them a good country.

And looking at their politics, it just all kinda looks bad. Similiar with their stuff like healthcare, or their enviromental disasters etc. etc.

Again on a very surface level examination the US comes out great, but if you look closer, at the underlying inequalities, and some of the fucked up shit happening towards its own population aswell as other countries population (like ruining the live of a german business man for making a (under german law) completely legal deal with Iran, because they try to enforce US law on other nations citizens when those citizens act in ways that do not affect the US), the image becomes a lot muddier, muddy enough to not consider a top 1 country I'd say, but ofcourse thats a very personal judgement.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7dd0ho/germany_replaces_us_as_country_with_best/dpx9k90/,Arvendilin,1510862435

4146,"Thanks I believe you used correct word, I just never heard about that thing in English language. In that case I am going to supply you with example. And contra argument your phrase “to become a thing” because it already is a thing. In Brno(Czech Rep.) we use it since 1930. It started as centralized production of heat in vapor for industry with electricity as side product. Then it slowly expanded to heat for housing. Then switching from coal to natural gas, connecting a waste incinerator. In last years connecting biomass powered generators(Which I don’t like :D ) and switching pipes from vapor to liquid water above 100C for efficiency.


So currently we live in system where during summer most of hot water is being heated by waste heat from waste burning. During winter we turn on gas burning generation.


For example one of the latest generator (1999) combines gas turbine, which produces electricity and gives heat to produce vapor which is used to produce electricity at normal turbine. Which gives heat unusable for electricity generation to city heating grid. During summer they work as reserve spike power plant, when they are being used they send heat to storage in large water tanks, from where it’s being sent to city once needed.


[Currently we have 192 km of heat pipes under city.](http://www.teplarny.cz/upload/1508146618.1682.PDF) So central district heating is here the default option. Same as in other cities in Czech Rep.

Yeah, sure but when it comes to issues like those what it cares about should be of limited concern. Back in Cold War times most western corporations would love to exploit their workers, pay them as little as possible etc. but weren't allowed to by governments who figured that if they won't make their workers happy, Soviets will. It's only in the last 30 years, with USSR threat gone, this wild corporate capitalism was allowed to flourish. It's hardly a natural state of things, as some would paint it. 

One could argue (and many do) that this mostly unregulated corporate capitalism was a moderately successful for a while, but eventually failed experiment. 

Fact that an unregulated semi-monopolist positions of companies such as Facebook or Google are a threat to what we'd call ""liberal democracy"" becomes more and more apparent.

4228,"I studied in Seoul, **South Korea** - Americans are diffidently on the top of their list without a doubt. There country literally wouldn't exist without the US and even those that are very anti-war regardless of what country still strongly believe if it weren't for the US, Korea would be unified, unified under communist rule. 

**Japan** isn't a whole lot different, they just really dislike the military bases. US remains the only power in Japanese history to conquer it, previously including during WW2 it was thought impossible. It was expected for the emperor to be executed and for the imperial family to live in exile, instead to keep from further bloodshed happening, the emperor was allowed to exist with very limited powers. Japan rose out of the ashes like much of Europe in a capitalistic American vision and become one of the richest countries in the world.. so there's serious political differences, especially with those bases but ultimately there's more respect than anything else.

**Philippines**.. again, the approval rating pre-Duterte for the US was insanely high, still is extremely high. Once belonging to the US, the Americans gave it up peacefully and even supported them through trade. Because the ""imperialist"" weren't feeling very imperial, the Philippines loved America for supporting it's sovereignty. Something Puerto Rico may reluctantly face in the future if debts aren't figured out. 

**Vietnam** has come a long way.. it's similar to the elderly in Miami with views of Cuba vs the young Cuban Americans with a much different view on things. Obama was actually very welcomed by the majority of Vietnam, it was on every TV, social media, etc. Trade between the two countries dramatically increase with relations continuing to improve. In fact the US is one of Vietnams very top trading partners up there with China and South Korea. The country will likely keep the same views of what happened during the war first with the French colonialism, their retreat and then the Americans scorched earth approach (literally). But Vietnam also has a bone to pick with China over serious regional issues, this is where the US conveniently steps in. With that power, it helps keep China on it's toes in relations rather than doing whatever it pleases. 

**Myanmar** is another where Obama visited and was actually welcomed in a country with an extremely brutal past and present. Where Aung San Suu Kyi became a Nelson Mandela of Burma/Myanmar. But what's different here is one part of the government still see US overall as an enemy more than a partner. And another chunk has seen it as a vital ally in trying to normalize the region that again has a very very violent past. People see this and views of the US are increasing.. but that's like hitting rock bottom.. you either stay there or you go up. Still, views of America in Asia in some former enemy regions are actually improving, even under Trump. 

**TL;DR:** US has actually gained ground in Asia, with Obama's Pivot to Asia it was a colossal move that'll be felt for decades both in military stance but also US foreign policy, even under a Trump presidency. But I'm with other people here, shocked the US was top to begin with.. typically the greatest military power in the world is also one of the most hated.

- This money could pay for millions of refugees within Europe and provide for many millions more (that don't qualify for asylum) living outside. Over time a large percentage of this spending would be recouped in taxes and stronger economic growth (both domestically and abroad). 
- These refugees would be able to claim asylum outside of Europe, there would be no need to travel across the Med or go to Libya. They could be vetted.

Seriously? That is the two options here? Complete and utter stateless anarchy or a police &amp; nanny state? Is there no middle ground?

&gt; Alcohol is available in Iceland, why do some people get so worked up about there being some restrictions and added tax on it? Seriously, binge drinking or not, alcohol has a negative effect on public health. Having an additional tax on it is perfectly justified because the authorities are responsible for dealing with the consequences of it, through our system of universal healthcare.

I am fully aware alcohol is available in some way. But I don't think you can argue with how strict it is in Iceland, only certain places can sell it and the prices are ludicrous. You can have an additional tax on it but what Iceland has is much more than just a little tax. The prices are insane. You're paying up to 7 euro a pint and then don't even get started on a bottle of something stronger. It's waaaaay too much. Because the state is so afraid of it's people's own culture.

&gt; I also want to point out that in general Iceland is a very free culture, undisciplined even. People here are noticeably worse at abiding by rules and being punctual, compared to the usual North European Germanic stereotype. Icelandic kids could generally do with a big dose of extra discipline. So if anything I'm rather puzzled that in this case my country managed to come up with some successful policies involving stricter parenting.

Doubtful to be honest, I've never heard of Icelandic people being free and undisciplined. In my experience they were extremely robotic and disciplined. Nevertheless an undisciplined culture should not be remedied with law after law and regulation after regulation.

I am sorry but having a curfew in the 21st century western world in my opinion is utterly and absolutely unjustifiable.

4308,"What I can tell you about Germany specifically is that so far the answers I've seen regarding this topic boil down to ""it's complicated"".

The organisation responsible for [age ratings](http://www.usk.de/service/lootboxen-und-jugendschutz/) for example says that it's not up to them to define if these boxes constitute gambling (up to legislators and courts) and that to them it sounds more like a general consumer issue. At the same time they consider them 'problematic' and ask to be told about cases where they're specifically advertised to kids and youth.

Just in October they gave a pretty [interesting reply](https://www.golem.de/news/jugendschutz-lootboxen-gelten-bisher-nicht-als-gluecksspiel-1710-130632.html) in which they stated that *as of now* these things aren't officially gambling, with similar replies from the ESRB (US) and PEGI (EU).

What makes the issue complicated in Germany specifically, to my knowledge, is that gambling needs for example a ""substantial wager"" and the change for a ""substantial win"". Since you can't usually *sell* the things you get it again gets more complicated because now it could be entertainment and not gambling again - analogue to a gum machine instead of a casino.

All in all the tl;dr seems to be that people need to sue so that courts have to figure the issue out.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7dbokx/belgiums_gambling_regulators_are_investigating/dpwupa6/,rEvolutionTU,1510848153

Know what, I actually go to Poland. 

The change that's been done in the last 15 years is incredible. It went from a butt of jokes to a country that's an inspiration to the whole former Eastern block (well, at least it was up until the last election).

I mean, the average gross wage increased what, 4,5 times since I first visited (about twenty years) ? Reckon you'd have done better without the EU? Cause I don't 

The shabby towns that had little of interest but the marketplace on the edge of town are now reconstructed and organised in a way that leaves me thinking we slacked off big time in Slovakia. 

Warsaw (though still keeping that punk spirit) is a proper proud European metropole, something I wouldn't think possible in such a short period of time since it was...well, different. 

And in every European city, smart Poles making headway in their respective fields are easy to find. And those that aren't shining stars, but have built better lives for themselves, are even more plentiful. 

Yeah, your politicians were corrupt (not that they aren't now). As were ours, as were those in every country that underwent a post-communist transformation. But in what world is that something you can blame the EU for? 

And as to your ""we thought this was a trade agreement"" point, that's just... Simply not true. *Everybody* in fhe former Eastern block goddamn knew this was going to be something different, maybe with them exception of children and the senile, but then, those didn't think it was was going to be a free trade zone. They just didn't think at all.

Poland in the EU has been a huge success.

When you had a chance to stop it before it became a crises, a major threat, a proxy war with the West. I love Russians but the Russian government needs to be punished more than simply sanctions against oligarchs and their militaristic ambitions needs to be stopped through diplomacy rather than the West going even further into an arms frenzy.

But seriously, after the [last parlamentary elections in Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_parliamentary_election,_2017), there are 5 parties. Ordered by size, they are:

  1. The party of the political chameleons, opportunists who get into politics to serve their own business interests. It is led by a dude who was the bodyguard of the former communist dictator, then worked for some time as racketeer. At some point at the turn of the century the former communists, now rich people with money and power, started grooming him to become a political figure. A lot of media attention, managed to build him a great image. Eventually ""founded"" the party, immediately won the elections 4 cycles ago, has been prime minister since (almost without interruption).
  2. The ""Socialist Party"" which is the communist party, just renamed. Same people and their kids.
  3. A collection of ""patriotic"" parties, basically Russian-funded populists, use nationalistic rhetoric to get votes.
  4. The ""Turkish"" party. A political project of the former ""state security"", the Bulgarian version of the Soviet KGB. A lot of the Turkish minority vote for them. It is very successful in benefiting from the conflict between Bulgarians and Turkish-speaking Bulgarians, a conflict that has been actively aggravated by the Communists throughout the communist times, culminating in the [""Revival Process""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revival_Process).
  5. A party of a businessman who has been laundering Russian money for almost two decades.

""Far cheaper than ours"" would not be a problem as long as they are what the Chinese minimum wage is, as long as this minimum wage is liveable in China. ""Too cheap"" is because of companies not paying full wages and sometimes even using slave labour.

4894,"Eu4 Rules V2
BY KRUGERRAND, MARIO AND JTALINO
1 ‘Meta’ -
	
	1.1 - Administrator Rulings Are Final
		If any unforeseen scenario arises that isn’t covered by the rules, or a conflict 
		occurs due to an unclear or open-ended rule, the administrators reserve the 
right to create a judgement at their own discretion. This ruling is final.

1.2 - Rehosts
		Rehosts will be carried out at the administrator's discretion. There is no set
		time for rehosts aside from the fifteen minute break, Admins will prioritise			game state over time played when considering rehosts.

1.3 - Pauses
		Pauses will be used sparingly in order to allow lagging players to catch up to 
		current day. This will be carried out by either the host or an admin. Players 
		should not be using the pause button for any reason unless this has been 
		cleared by an administrator, i.e. in the case of a large war settlement. 

1.3.1 - Unconditional Surrender
There will be no pauses during unconditional surrenders. The winner will have to make up the peace deal within 3 months.

1.4 - Protected Status
		If you cannot attend a session and cannot / do not desire to use a substitute,		you can apply for a protected status for your nation for one session. From 
		1600 onwards this rule is no longer in effect. This relies on the player who is		absent letting an administrator know, otherwise this will not apply. Protected 		status also applies if a player drops mid-session -- this only applies until the 		next rehost.

1.5 - Solving Disputes
		In the event of a dispute, the involved parties may be asked to join a separate		Discord channel in order for administrator arbitration so the dispute can be 		resolved quickly.

1.6 - In The Event Of A Crash / DC
		If a crash / disconnect occurs that is not important enough to warrant an 			immediate rehost the player must accept the decision of the AI as what they		would have done. Players are expected to set their AI settings in the Main			Menu.

1.7 - Game speed
		The minimum accepted game speed during a campaign is speed 2. Whilst we		understand that certain situations may call for a lowered game speed, such as		particularly large wars and peace talks, any player that cannot maintain an 		average of speed 2 in peacetime will be asked to leave the campaign.

1.8 - Punishments
		So far, two tiers of punishments exist for rule-breaking:

Any broken rule besides nation ruining will resort in a kick from the session if the player infringing the rule refuses to correct it. I.e. refusing to grant a CN independence when they have achieved de facto independence.


Nation ruining will result in a ban from the current campaign as well as a ban from the following campaign. This is non-negotiable.













2 ‘Before The Campaigns Begins’ -

2.1 - Nation Selection
		You will be asked to pick five countries that you would like to play in order of 		preference. In the event that multiple players pick the same country, it will be 		assigned to one of them randomly using a random number generator. Players		with a history of nation ruining in previous campaigns will not be allowed to		select Great Powers (as defined by the Great Power list in the 1444 start date)		This does not affect new players.

		2.1.1 - Either / Or Nations
			In order to account for historicity, balance and player preference, 
			some nations will only be allowed to be picked if a corresponding 
			nation is not. So far no nations fall under this rule.

2.1.2 - Banned Nations
			Due to problems regarding balance and historicity, the following
			nations are banned from being selected;
Ming

2.1.3 - Recurring Players
			To allow new players to play nations that have otherwise been 
			associated with a particular player, a player may not play the same 			nation in two back to back campaigns. 










3 ‘During The Campaign’ -

3.1 - Nation Selection During A Campaign
		Nations that are unplayed and unprotected as per rule 1.4 can be picked.

3.2 - Nation Substitution
	Should a player be absent, a temporary substitute may be found. Only the		original player can select a substitute or give consent to another player to find	one.

3.3 - Colonial Nations
		Players may switch to one of their own colonial nations at any time, though		be aware that doing so forfeits any right to their starting country. Ruining the		starting nation before switching will result in the player receiving a one			campaign ban as the standard penalty for nation ruining.

		Players selecting a colonial nation under a player overlord are must be aware		that they have one attempt at an independence war to achieve their freedom, 	             and they must leave the country in the event of a defeat. 


3.4 - Forced PU / Vassalage
	Should a player fall under a Personal Union they have twenty-five years to 	achieve independence from their overlord. You will be removed from your 		country should you fail to achieve independence within this timeframe unless 	you are actively fighting an independence war.


If a peace treaty forces a player nation into vassalage they must immediately 	vacate that country. 







4 ‘General Rules’ -

4.1 - Nation Ruining
		Nation Ruining is defined as carrying out actions that hurt your nation with no		real benefit, and cannot be satisfactorily explained to an administrator. 			Examples of nation ruining include; Releasing all available vassals; declaring		war on a nation with the sole intention to give away land or enter vassalage;		deleting armies / navies before switching nation or leaving the game; taking 		out the maximum amount of loans to give the money away, etc.

		This list is not exhaustive and administrators reserve the right to call out 			nation ruining behaviour on the spirit of the rule. The standard penalty for 		nation ruining behaviour is a one campaign ban.

4.2 - Abuse Of Game Mechanics
		Abuse of game mechanics or bugs in the game that the administration team / 		the EU4 community is aware of may result in punishment or rolling back the		save in order to correct the bug. Due to the nature of the rule, the list below is		subject to change, and administrators reserve the right to call out abusive			behaviour during a running campaign.

		The list of currently actionable bugs is as follows;

Moving your national capital to a one province island near a colonial region in order to avoid colonial nations spawning.









5 ‘Player Wars’ -

5.1 - HRE Emperor Abuse
		If a player is Emperor of the HRE they cannot accept a call to arms from 			members of the HRE for IA and then peace out of the war in order to farm			Imperial Authority.

5.2 - Joining An Ongoing War
		Ways to join an ongoing war when you are not allied to either party are 			limited to the following options:

Using the ‘Enforce Peace’ button.
Using the ‘Great Power Intervention’ mechanic.

		You may not ally with a party who is already at war with the intention of 			using that to join their current war.

5.3 - Separate Peace Deals
		Separate peace deals are an allowed and encouraged practice. This allows		smaller players to escape large wars that may potentially cripple their nation,		for example. However, if the war leader offers an unconditional surrender it 		must be accepted and he must be the one to give up land, money or any other		diplomatic penalties.

5.4 - Enforcement Of Independence Wars
		If a colonial independence war has lasted for more than five years, and the 		attacker controls all of the territory connected to their capital, they have 
		achieved de facto independence and it must be granted if this is the only			demand in the peace deal. This does not apply if the attackers capital is a one
		province island such as Bermuda.






6 ‘Miscellaneous Balance Rules’ -

	6.1 - Winning The Campaign
		The overall winner of the campaign will be decided as the player with the 			most score on the last day of the final session. Victory Cards are not going to		be enabled for our campaigns.
	6.2 - Chinese Tributary Rule
		You may not offer to become a tributary of the Chinese Emperor if you are not		located in East Asia. (China, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Indochina and		Manchuria.)

&gt;
&gt;The union partner responsible for over 50% of Europe's collective industrial might

No, I meant support the claim that this is a German desire and not the desire of other members.  You said:

&gt;If EU cough Germany cough is going to meddle in Polish internal policy affairs against the will of the Polish people

I'm fine with also talking about Germany's relative influence, though I'd still like to see you provide support for your claim above.

Germany is the largest EU member.   But there will always be a largest member in any collection of states.  Clearly that's no barrier to union unless you rule out unions of states in general.

Looking at EU structure:

* She has no special powers when it comes to the veto.  In fact, Germany is tremendously-weakened by the existence of a veto, as she has no more clout than any other member, many of which are significantly-smaller.

* [She has the third-weakest per-capita influence in the EP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apportionment_in_the_European_Parliament#Nice_system), where representation is slanted to favor smaller members.

* She is disproportionately-large in GDP (though not as much as some members).  But she's still just 21% of the EU GDP.  That's a pretty small slice to say that she dominates the EU, even if there were mechanisms directly bound to GDP.

* You've been rather vague about the mechanism via which this GDP is converted into influence.  I want something more than hand-waving.  Germany has the largest GDP in the EU.  In what way does this permit her to ""dominate"" the EU in any special sense in which any non-EU state couldn't similarly exert influence?",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7d4swh/eu_parliament_launches_action_against_poland/dpw850k/,vokegaf,1510808212

But I don't agree with your general premise: that if a government was elected, that there can and should be *no* form of restrictions on that government.

If you just elected someone and then gave them absolute power for that period, you'd have a sort of structure where you'd have elective despotism.  Two issues with this:

* If there is any power that they can wield that can undermine the elective process, they risk permanently grabbing power.  Maybe they strip voters of the franchise, or change the rules for political parties, or so forth.

* I think that there is a very legitimate concept that certain radical changes can have a higher bar than 50%+1 of the population at a given point in time.  Maybe there's a second vote required after a waiting period (some EU members do this for constitutional amendments) or a supermajority to give the public time to consider carefully whether it was passion of the movement and permit objections to be raised.

Is the EU right to act here?  Maybe so, maybe not.  But is the concept of a governing coalition being constrained in some ways invalid?  No, I don't think so.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7d4swh/eu_parliament_launches_action_against_poland/dpw2gp4/,vokegaf,1510801098

5070,"I appreciate the long detailed answer.  I'm not sure how much of it sunk in but I think I understand the general idea.  

The basic issue of course is the unanimity requirement.  In short, I like having a Federal government and a fairly clear agreement on what is Federal and what is State although it did take the bloodiest war in our history to get everyone on the same page with that and some people still try to be creative.  

Having served in the army, I can think of a lot of practical issues building an army when you do not know until after the shooting starts who will take part and who will not.  It obviously complicates unit organization and if one or two countries opt out and they had certain specialized units or equipment it creates a hole.  

On the other hand, I can't think of any likely situation in which the EU would be deploying into serious conflict without the US being involved regardless of NATO so we could fill the gap wherever it opens.  

As for the trade issue, I really don't care but from what I understand the spirit if not the word of Free Trade agreements is that you open up your market to anyone in the zone.  China and certain countries seem to have very different thoughts on what Free Trade means.  This sounds like you want to open up markets to certain members of a trade agreement but not others.  The US produces a lot of its military stuff but we also import a lot to include specialized vehicles and weapons.  If you have protectionist language specifying which countries to buy from and excluding others in the zone I can see that as an issue.  Of course when it comes to military technology there are some things that we keep in house and may well not even sell to anyone.  

I know you have different ways of making agreements but from an American perspective you either are or are not a sovereign nation capable of making its own decisions.  If you are not the actual decision maker then we want to talk to the actual decision makers and not you.  I know it is a long process but I really think that Europe needs to sort out if the EU is or is not a Federal government that can over rule individual members.  I have lived in Europe and I really enjoyed the different cultures from place to place and they should be preserved but more unity is needed as well.

And of course that's me disrespecting all the sacrifices Americans made to make a point.

They're native Europeans. People move, but don't try and use that as an arguement that the French people don't have more right to the land than a group who immigrated 50 years ago please. It's ridiculous to say that. 

People didn't move *that* much until the last couple of hundred years and even then it wasn't the sort of immigration we have today. We did of course have migrations after the and during the Fall of Rome, but that was a long, long time ago.

Go back to the Middle Ages and we barely moved out of our own villages in Europe. So don't tell me that people who trace their history here back to 1950 have the same attachment to my country as the English people do.

The jihadists that did fight in Afghanistan were founded by ISI. Also US didn't kill 200k in Iraq. The vast majority of deaths in Iraq are on Iraqis themselves. Sectarian violence was not a consequence of US invasion but of groups settling old scores, scores that came to be due to Saddam and his rule of mass murder, rape and genocide. Had US not invaded Iraq in '03, Iraq would have exploded at the start of Arab spring and along with half a million dead in Syria we would have had probably a million or so dead in Iraq because God knows that Saddam would never have given up an ounce of power and his sons were crazy Roman emperor reborn. 

Also Saudis went into Yemen to support the legitimate government of Yemen against religious fanatics./s Saudis did the same thing Iran did in Syria. They are backing their guy. The only difference Iranians and Russians came down hard from the start. Assad has starved millions into submission, Homs, Damascus enclaves, Aleppo all while the Iranians and Russians patted his back. The Saudis on the other hand had allowed the port of Al Hudaydah to remain in operation and all they got for it was Iran smuggling ballistic missiles into Yemen. After the world did nothing when Assad starved millions, when Assad gassed thousands.Take those crocodile tears somewhere else.    

The US never really armed the rebels, few small scale limited actions and isolated groups not withstanding. US involvement was primarily in overseeing the transfer of weapons from Saudis and Turks, controlling which groups got weapons and limiting the weapons they got in both quality and quantity. Also US pushed back ISIS. Not the YPG, not KRG Peshmerga, not Iraqi army, not PMUs. Without US ISIS would have wiped the floor with the YPG, as they did before US intervened and stooped ISIS. US wipe out ISIS armored force, US wiped out ISIS artillery and what US didn't destroy it ensure that those weapons could not be concentrated or properly employed.

I want everyone to be able to decide their own futures. If NI wanted to join Ireland, I would wholeheartedly support them. But right now, a majority of them don't.

That's just what a cunt would say.

&gt; No matter what you say on this thread or on any other thread, just know that one day Northern Ireland will either become a free state on itself, or rejoin the republic so we can finally live in Unity

If that's what the Northern Irish want, then fine. You, on the other hand, don't care what the Northern Irish want, do you? Because every moment that Northern Ireland *isn't* yours is an atrocity to you. And surely the Northern Irish must be brainwashed - how else could they have different opinions to you?

infringements quickly and effectively, notably where the trader selling goods or services
conceals its identity or relocates within the Union or to a third country to avoid
enforcement. In cases where there is a risk of serious harm to consumers, in accordance
with national law, the competent authorities should be able to adopt interim measures
including, the removal of content from an online interface or ordering the explicit
display of a warning to consumers when accessing the online interface. Interim
measures should not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objective. Furthermore,
the competent authorities should have the power to order the explicit display of a
warning to consumers when accessing the online interface or order the removal or
modification of digital content when there are no other effective means to stop an illegal
practice. Such measures should not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the
objective of ceasing or prohibiting the infringement.

Why is it not sufficient? It deals with the customs issue, which is what the EU and UK are concerned about.

&gt;It fact it's a rather banal dumbass solution.

Again, why? It means that goods treated properly, which is the issue. I mean we manage with services, cross border sales (globally..) and so on. Why is it suddenly problematic now?

&gt;Because of that we will veto and further talks of 'transition' or 'trade',

Well, OK then. Not a lot the UK can do about that. But the UK isn't about to set up internal borders between its constituent parts, and it's not about to put a hard border on the Island or Ireland. And on the latter, nor is Ireland.

So I suppose we could end up in a position where there is no deal between the UK and the EU, no border in Ireland and the UK and EU still have to deal with the customs issues.. How is that better exactly?

For dualist countries this is fixed through expressing what ever the EU says through legislation, but the constitutional issue is side stepped. I can’t speak for Germany, but I imagine it’s the same for everyone. You have to have a referendum to amend the constitution or you can’t do it. Period.

This isn’t a Directive concerning commerce, a certain aspect of contract law, or a regulation concerning greenhouse emssisions. These things can be implemented through what every channels are established and if it conflicts with a constitution then it’s a referendum that’s needed. 

Think of it like water, it’s flows, it carved ridges, these ridges become more defined and eventually we have rivers. If you want a new river you need to start the process again otherwise you’re sending what ever you need to send done one of the established rivers.

The policy being pursued by the west is just - as you point out - half assed and clearly not helping. But within the given (current) context and given the policy being pursued it's hardly an irrational choice to make. Clearly someone effed up here. But it was not the guy calling the shots on the ground or the advisors, who have zero leverage under the current policy.

I agree wholeheartedly with your argument. But this was not a military mistake. From that perspective it was a fairly sane one in a difficult situation. The issue resides higher up the chain of command, specifically that the west won't commit more than a token show force. Now I am not saying put EU / US boots on the ground.

Germany is not decarbonising as fast as other large emitters - it is the 14th of 23 countries analysed - and, by exporting electricity generated by fossil fuels, Germany is significantly increasing the CO2-intensity of neighbouring countries' electricity consumption, the report says.    
""Climate leaders are countries with hydro-power resources and strong policies to support nuclear energy, alongside renewables. These countries include Switzerland (hydro and nuclear), Norway (hydro) and Sweden (hydro and nuclear). In contrast, anti-nuclear Austria backs up its hydro capacity with fossil fuels, driving down its overall climate performance,"" the report says.
""Countries that have pragmatic yet ambitious climate and energy policies, such as the UK, are driving down their emissions. The UK has achieved the largest absolute reduction in GHG emissions in Europe from 2010-2015. Some Eastern Europe countries like Poland, Slovakia and Czech Republic, have also decreased their high emissions levels significantly in the recent years while growing their economies,"" it adds.

5775,"&gt;  Levi jeans and Nike sneakers used to be The Cool Thing because only the Coolest Folks could afford them.

no, but because they were illegal to import by law (if you produce something in your country its illegal to import such item). That is why individuals were going to Italy and smuggling those in. You could not buy those in legal stores but only from smugglers. They were not significantly more expensive but they were ""Cool"" because it was illegal item and in small quantity. But if you really wanted them you could easily afford them.

&gt; Nowadays, Nike sneakers are being bought to little kids that outgrow them in a year or two, 

In general population? No they are not - thats huge misrepresentation (unless if you are talking about cheap knock off chinese Nike's)

&gt;  and nobody even gives a toss about Levis (which we can buy here instead of in Trieste) because they stopped being ""cool"" because they're ""hard to come by"".

exactly - they were cool because they were forbidden to import - not because people were not able to afford them.

&gt; We used to have one crappy screen in the whole family, nowadays we have some screen for every member of the family. 

Most people in the West at that time had one TV in the house - TV was something new and electronics in general (in the World were expensive) - and now that TV's (and electronics) are mass produced and relatively cheap many houses have two (crappy quality) TV's in the house (not high end TV's) - You can buy used TV for 50 to 100 euroes and thats what majority of people do.

&gt; We drove shit Fićos and Jugos, now we drive less-shit Škodas and VW's, 

You mean we drove NEW domestic cars with guarantee on them (because imported new cars were heavily taxed) - and now we drive 15 to 20 years old cars that break down every now and then -because we barely produce any domestic cars.

&gt;  and the ""cool car among the youths"" isn't a fucking Golf but a Mercedes or BMW.

cool car among the youths is Mercedes or BMW - but IF  you drive a car as young lad you usually drive Fiat , Alfa , Skoda  OR if you are lucky you drive Golf - Only really rich kids from rich parents can afford BMW or Mercedes. - Again IF you are driving your own car as a young lad (not your father's car)

&gt; During high school trips, we used to travel to Belgrade and Sarajevo and Ljubljana, now we travel to Greece and Spain and UK.

We used to travel to exYugoslavia cities and places twice a year like it was nothing - now you are lucky if you can afford to travel to that last one excursion trip to Greece or Spain. Many can barely afford to send their teenagers to that trip but they borrow money or take credit from Bank to do so.

Even with traveling costs in general (in the World) going down.

&gt; Do I need to go on? 

No? Yes? Why do you ask?

&gt;  And this is a ""middle class"" (by local standards) family in a middle class neighborhood with middle class friends and co-workers.

Maybe but its very different if middle class is 20% or less percent of population (like today) or when middle class is 80% to 90% of population (like during Tito)


&gt; And no, we don't partially or basically-fully pay for neither healthcare nor schooling, our schooling is as free as it gets (yes, you have to buy your own books) all the way until the end of college. You only pay for college if you fail too many exams - and sorry, but, that's your fault. As for healthcare, again, speaking as a person who had and has way too many encounters with health services (same for most of my family), if I total all the costs, they'd end up being something like 10% (at most) of the total value of services and medicines used. (Insulin is expensive. It's covered by insurance.)

Maybe its significantly different across exYu but unless we are talking about most basic health problems (common cold, sprained anckle and similar) you will pay significant amount out of pocket - any scanning (and similar procedures) or rare medicine for some more complicated illness will cost you much.

for schooling if you are lucky to study in your own town and live with parents it can come cheap - if you study in another city the costs are very significant and not many people can afford that. And you say ""you ONLY pay for books"" like not every professor has new (same) book every year and trying to squeeze as much money from students as possible - among other costs.

&gt; Another example of how it all works... if you're unemployed, monthly tram-ticket costs 30 Kuna in Osijek. (4 Euros.)

As opposed to being totally free if you were unemployed. Not many people were though.

&gt; But as I said - I guess it depends on who you're asking.

Inflation is a tricky figure though since it includes a lot more than items of everyday life. In Germany for example the conversion was 2:1 for DM to Euro. Easy enough and yet food and small services such as getting your hair cut increases massively following the conversion to Euro. To be fair those items have been relatively sticky since then so it kind of evened out but still. 

For example - Can of coke at your local kiosk used to be 1,50DM.....should have been 0.75euro but in fact was 1,2Euro. Going to the hairdresser never cost me more than 30-40DM but 20Euro was basically the new minimum after the currency was changed.

THERESA May was warned not to guarantee the rights of EU citizens living in Britain before she became Prime Minister, it has emerged.

Sir Ivan Rogers, Britain's ambassador to the EU, told Mrs May it was one of the ""few cards"" would she be able to play in the Brexit negotiations.

From what I hear, the situation in Lithuania was so horrible partly because of a lack of government control and partly because the market for necessary goods, e.g. the market for foodstuffs, did not have lots of competition. Apparently there is an influx of German supermarket chains, which should increase competition in the medium-term.

If you do have sufficient competition, the time one business unfairly incerases prices the one down the road can keep its lower ones and gain new consumers. For this to work however, you first of all need that business down the road and ofc. a government preventing businesses from agreeing on prices.

A particular horrible case is ofc. government services, because they are outside the market and there the government has a duty to keep prices fair. While this has little to do with EU institutions, it is still not right to let a country enter the Eurozone if its own government is this incompetent.

5961,"but not because the energy production is so expensive, it costs more or less the same everywhere. 

also aside from gas to power usage, we also use gas in private housholds for cooking and warmwater and such stuff. so during periods of lets of wind you can use power to gas tech to sell wind power instead of shutting down plants.

as noted that is already something that is done in parts of germany  in a comercial way that doesnt need subsidis. the part that requires money is for the part when there is a shortage. we dont have the infrastructure and the smart solutions in place to instantly power up a huge amount of gas to power plants. and iam pretty sure that wont pay by itself.

but technically the power storage, once all the methan is burnt can use russias gas to keep those gas to power plants running for ever. so in my opinion that is y very viable part of the solutions.

not enough to run on 100% renewable energys, not even enough for 70 or 60%, but iam very sure you can stabilize up to 50% renewable power on a day by day level without much initial investment. most of what we need for this is ready researched,  tested and already in place.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7cwtd8/germany_is_burning_too_much_coal/dpukd28/,Darirol,1510733883

Competition isn't great. It has increased with Lidl shops being built but they won't be able to push the Maxima giant around. Its just too big and everywhere.

I don't know what they are doing actually. It seems like there's only EU governance and then some idiots in Lithuania who do whatever.

For example if you to Birmingham in England, you find that ""all right"" is  roughly ""oll roght"" and ""but"" is roughly ""pot"" but it is hard to across in writing.

You are confusing Visa with work permits. Visas are *not* work permits. They allow you to enter a country for a given amount of time, but not to legally work there. While I do not doubt a certain amount of blacklisted work can be done in that period and that Visas make it easier for Ukranians to be legally employed in the EU, this is not a means for mass work immigration. For this, you require other legal mechanisms.
