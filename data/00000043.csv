7,"&gt; ""The description of Stephan E. and his readiness to commit violence — that was very noticeable,"" Schaus said. As the dossier showed, there was plenty to suggest that Stephan E. could turn out to be a terrorist: He put a pipe bomb in the cellar of a German-Turkish boy's home as a teenager, stabbed an imam in 1992, put another pipe bomb in a car outside a home for asylum applicants in 1993, and in 2009 was in of a crowd of neo-Nazis that attacked a leftist May 1 demonstration in Dortmund.

&gt; After he read that dossier, Schaus invited the officer who wrote it to testify to the committee as a
witness. ""I remember asking the officer whether she thought Stephan E. should be considered a right-wing terrorist,"" Schaus said. ""She couldn't confirm that.""

Who could say that someone who, among other violent crimes, repeatedly tries to commit politically motivated bombings against minorities is a terrorist or not? Not me.

133,"**The European Union's fishing activity outside of European waters and the Sustainable Development Goals**


The EU's fishing fleet engages in extensive fishing activities in the Exclusive Economic Zones of non‐EU countries as well as in areas beyond national jurisdiction. These activities are regulated by an external dimension in the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). We review the relationship between the CFP, including regulations for the Sustainable Management of External Fishing Fleets (SMEFF) and the role of Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements (SFPAs) and Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs), and the internationally agreed aims and definitions of sustainability provided by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDG that most directly relates to fish and fisheries is goal 14, to ""conserve and sustainably use the oceans."" This paper, however, focuses on relationships between the CFP and SDGs that target social and economic dimensions, including those aiming to eliminate poverty (1) and hunger (2), improve health (3), provide decent work and economic growth (8), and achieve gender equality (5) and peaceful institutions (16). We identify several areas where the EU's external fishing fleet interacts with different facets of those goals, and suggest some important improvements that can be made to support the development of the EU’s external fleet into a contributor, rather than counterforce, to sustainable development in line with commitments under Agenda 2030. We provide a first and broad overview of an important area for future interdisciplinary research. We conclude by identifying specific questions that can provide starting points for further in‐depth analyses of the sustainability of EU fishing activities in external waters.

Everything, everything in this graph and what you say is populistic bullshit. With some points I might even agree that it should happen but they simply didn't. Local agriculture didn't sudently rose since it's still more expensive then what you used to import and people didn't get richer (actually the contrary in 2015).

&gt;Russian agriculture can't compete with the imports from warmer countries because the local cost of production is simply too high. The only thing that grows more or less okay in this climate is wheat.

That doesn't change when you ban imports. This still remains expensive in a poor country. It's just the normal population that gets access to less. It's by no means a good thing.

It was only being made one month ago for everyone on the planet. Hyperbole as a way of making it seem that the remedy is here.

597,"Most parties in Greece are centre, centre-left, and far-left. We've got dozens of them. You can probably count centre-right ones in one hand and still have enough fingers to count the far-right ones in the same hand.


And politics is even in universities, with student wings of political parties being practically the ruling bodies of student councils and such. The two biggest student wings are one of New Democracy (current ruling party) and the one of the Communist Party. In the yearly student elections it's usually a close call between the two.

The communist one and the anarchist one do a lot of protests, sometimes about things that do matter, sometimes about things that don't really matter. For this thing specifically, they are technically protesting against the removal of the law that makes it nearly-impossible for the police to prosecute anyone who is inside the university ground. It existed from the fall of the military junta of the mid-70s all these way to 2019 or 2020. At that point, the academic asylum was revoked and security was allowed inside universities. Right now, it's being edited so as to allow policemen to keep being present inside 24/7.

Why is this happening? Because until 2019/2020, universities basically were lawless zones that criminals used for asylum, especially at night, and some of them were dangerous as fuck, especially for young women. There have been cases of rape and murder, but usually the most important illegal activity was drug dealing. All of this wasn't from the students, but from criminals who are in no way related to the university. The communist party and the anarchists think it goes against their (and other people's) rights to have the police inside the campus, so they protest.

So shouldnt the people of the USA have an equal say in things?  


&gt; I don't think the votes are unequal and I've explained this by stating they are not participating in the same election. 

and

&gt; As stated, I don't think your equation to calculate the unevenness means much of anything. 

Yes they do. Even though not directly but their vote matters for the presidential election and some votes weigh more than others.

So you think it is equal that Wyoming and Minnesota have the same amount of ECVs despite having such a difference in population?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I don't understand this question. 

The EC is to balance out population between states because rural states are a minority, right?  
For example within the whole US there are 9 city ppl for 1 rural person so 1 rural persons vote should have a weight of 9 to factor in their needs.

(At least thats your explaination to the system)

How would you feel if the EC would also change so that other minorities are respected?

Same example but in addition to that there are also 9 white ppl per 1 black person.

So lets say that black persons vote should also weigh 9 times more so they can represent their needs just like the rural folk.  
Bonus if you are Black and live in a rural area. Your vote would weigh so much more.

705,"This relates to something I've previously wondered about small countries but have never received a satisfactory answer.

How do little countries manage all the necessary agencies? For example, a big country might need X qualified people to run various agencies (e.g. building codes, approving medicines, food safety inspection, and so on). Some of these needs would scale with the size of the country, but others would not, so then smaller countries would have a disproportionate burden of a need for experts. Some needs you can also meet by paying to use the infrastructure of a larger country (e.g. sending military officers to train with a larger ally), but others not so easily (e.g. you need X engineers to check the safety of buildings and bridges). Not that you need an ""expert"" to pull a flag off a charging station, but it exemplifies that you get amateur hour situations like this, whereas other countries would have people whose job is to ensure protocols. Obviously this applies to more important issues than getting a good photo, but I'm just using the example of what's happening here. Another example where a function of government is missing might be that Iceland does not have a military, and instead, some military functions are performed by the police. I don't think the motivation for not having a military was to save money, but that might have been one factor.

So, how do little countries like Luxembourg, Iceland, and others manage this burden? If the answer is just simply ""the EU does it"", then how did they manage it before the EU? Surely the standards are not lower, notwithstanding this silly pic, so do/did they rely on what other countries say, or do they pay more proportionately to run what they need, or is it something else?",,/r/europe/comments/l1yaq9/luxembourg_is_when_top_government_members_bring_a/gk3hrpq/,JT_Cdn_Clt_Prc_Htlne,1611259191

755,"&gt; I'm just wondering why they should make the distinction clear. 

Because journalism is supposed to inform people.

&gt; There are a lot of small British firms to whom exporting or importing is nothing to do with them. So why do businesses who don't ship goods to the EU matter in a discussion about exactly that. Deliberately including them to shrink the 30% number to 2.5% is as much or more distorting the issue than what the article does.

They could easily present a holistic view by saying something like: ""Around 8% of UK SME's are exporters to the EU, nearly 30% of these businesses are currently unable to send their goods to the Single Market""

I hope you can see how that not only puts the sector itself in perspective, but also emphasises how considerable this specific problem is for those firms that are actually affected. It conveys some of the gravity of the situation whilst not muddying the economical context. 

&gt; A better criticism from what I read is they don't really discuss the details. If most of that 30% only do a very small % of business in the EU for example, then it impacts on profit but may not be completely critical, and since they can afford to chose not to export just for convenience that may be the case. Or it could be that its so awkward right now and paired with extra costs the margin for a lot of the 30% disappeared. Don't know for sure since it doesn't go into detail.

I'm going to point out the obvious; my point was one such detail that they left out. But you are correct about the rest, the content of the article is relatively meaningless without understand how important, on average, EU exports are to these sort of firms. It would also be interesting to see how larger firms have been impacted in comparison.

But that would be *real* journalism, the Independent is just another tabloid.

797,"From a European perspective the 
Nordstream pipeline does not really look good. It is especially a slap in the face for the Baltic states, Poland and Ukraine. 

From a human rights perspective it is probably not a good idea either especially since Russia’s interferes in the Ukraine, MH17, the Salisbury incident, the killing of a Georgian citizen in Berlin by a Russian agents and the Nawalny case. 

On the other side nearly all countries rely on oil from the Middle East and I also don’t hear human rights complaints when we talk about the 
TANAP-Pipeline.

From a different economic standpoint the Russian were always delivering their gas and it was quite cheap. 

Germany needs gas to keep its economy running and it can actually help to reach the climate goals since it is less polluting than the coal we are currently using. On the other hand it could be possible to further invest in our renewable energies which are constantly growing and it probably doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to build a new pipeline that we won’t need in the near future. 

We could also import Gas from Canada and the US via ships. I think we already have these terminals or are currently building them. 

However, the US is also putting a lot of pressure on Germany and threatening to sanction companies that work on the Nordstream Pipeline so that we buy their gas. I don’t think this is a fair move among partners.

The train station got fucked over by several private developers who never realized their plans with it, it has nothing to do with the government. Košice arguably has the most modern train station, and it’s all private money.

And the government spends plenty on Bratislava. I’m not one of the Eastern Slovaks whose going to hate on the city just by the virtue that of me being from the east, that’s very 90s - I actually adore the city, the people, and the way it showcases the country to the world. 

Having said that, we can’t get 40km of highways built in Košice region, while the state spends billions on infrastructure projects in Bratislava. We can’t get 4 million € to finish the football stadium in Košice after the one in Bratislava was close to 100 million €. Bratislava Airport is arguably a failure (albeit very pretty, and convenient), yet the state only takes profits out of Košice airport (of which it is a minority owner off, as Vienna Airports own it) with no reinvestment strategy. 

The issue of how the money is distributed is a complicated one, but your claim is far from reality. Bratislava is cool, developed, lovely city, but it does get disproportional amount of taxes invested into it.

I also think Putin might have been what the country needed to get out of the absolute chaos from after the fall of the SU, but having a corrupt dictator rule for life is not the right course of long term direction that benefits any country.

Cracking down on wide spread corruption should be top priority for any Russian leader, so it seems clear Putin is a major part of the criminal clique as he doesnt work much on the matter.  When after a few drinks I would ask Russian businessmen if corruption is an issue in their sector they would first laugh a while and then explain 'of course, its everywhere in Russia.'

1151,"I remember in high school, I was doing research in art class, and looking up a reference photo of a German tank, as I wanted to draw a piece of a battle scene where it was in the centre, getting straffed by an aircraft. After some time a teacher that came to talk with my art teacher saw my work and asked me about it. I told him the general layout and we got to talking about the war and the occupation (I told him that my grandmother grew up in occupied Netherlands among other things), and about a book I was reading for English Class, about a boy who was sent with his sibling and mother from Hungary in 1944 to the contration camp system. And he then showed me a video he took on his phone from a visit to one of the concentration camp museums.


It was 2-3 minutes long, and all it was all shoes. Stacked in massive piles, from one side of the warehouse, to the other. Meters deep, on both walls, with a corridor to walk through. And the video was just him walking in the corridor, pexi glass pane after the next of just stacks of leather shoes. For minutes. 


At that point I've seen standard documentary footage of War Crimes from that time. The guy gets shot in the head and falls in the pit, the burning peasants house in the eastern front, the London Blitz, the liberated camp survivors barely able to stand.
But that video gave me a new perspective. A visual of numbers so enormous I couldn't even guess how many people those shoes belonged to. People who wouldn't be able to own a second or spare pair of shoes, people who lived and loved, people who used to exist.

1168,"The Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) delivered its judgment on Thursday in the inter-State case of Georgia v. Russia (II) concerning the August War 2008.
“ECHR confirmed Russia violated several articles of the European Convention on Human Rights during the August War. The recognition of these violations proves Russia carried out Georgians’ ethnic cleansing during the August war,” Justice Ministry stated.
The Grand Chamber judgment reads, “the Russian Federation had exercised “effective control” over South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and the “buffer zone” during the period from 12 August to 10 October 2008, the date of the official withdrawal of the Russian troops.”
“After that period, the strong Russian presence and the South Ossetian and Abkhazian authorities’ dependency on the Russian Federation indicated that there had been continued “effective control” over South Ossetia and Abkhazia,” ECHR stated. The Court concluded that “the events occurring after the cessation of hostilities – that is, following the ceasefire agreement of 12 August 2008 – had fallen within the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation. It found a number of violations of the Convention.”

“This historic decision is an important advantage for Georgia to resolve conflicts and restore its territorial integrity through international legal instruments,” the Ministry stressed.
Georgia lodged on August 11, 2008, the inter-state application Georgia v. Russia (II) with the ECHR under Article 33 (Inter-State cases) of the European Convention on Human Rights. The application was declared admissible and relinquished to the Grand Chamber on 3 April 2012.
Georgia accused Russia of violating eight articles of the European convention on human rights. It raises issues under Articles 2 (right to life), 3 (prohibition of torture, inhuman and degrading treatment), 5 (right to liberty and security), 8 (right to respect for private and family life), and 13 (right to an effective remedy) of the Convention, under Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No. 1 (protection of property and right to education), as well as under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (freedom of movement). ECHR held the oral hearing into the case on May 23, 2018.

1193,"&gt;But nowadays, it is quite obvious how much power has shifted from the States to the Federal government. 

That is a legitimate problem, but the solution is for the states to regain their autonomy, not the other way around. Also, Congress is supposed to be the source of power for most of the Federal powers but Congress ceded many of those powers to the President over the last 60 years. Again that is something that should be reversed to the original intention.

A big issue is thst Executive Action has replaced law as the basic activity in government because it requires no compromise. It also lacks staying power and can be changed in a moment once a new President is elected (See what Biden did today). 

Congress is supposed to create the law that the President enforces. Congress is supposed to ratify international agreements. Most of the complaints I have seen from Europe come from a President usurping those powers and making an agreement that lacks staying power due to it not being ratified. The Iran Agreement and the Paris Climate Accord are both good examples. Congress actually had the power to make those agreements law, but Obama didn't have support for them. Obama just made the agreements on his own and that left the agreements and our politics in a bad situation. It would have been far better for him to work towards an appealing compromise that could have been ratified.

Congress has the power to declare war, but Bush decided to go to Iraq and Obama decided to go to Syria and Libya. Congress never voted for either war. Again, huge erosion in the way powers were distributed.

That is just one of many ways that the system actually works just fine but the federal government has decided to erode the institutions in the system to fit short term initiatives and politics. 

If the federal government would let the system work as intended then there are few actual flaws.",,/r/europe/comments/l15zle/do_europeans_think_the_us_system_works_well_or_is/gk1xk4c/,Kmartknees,1611230891

Again just before 1915 total number of Armenians were 1.2 million. And we also know that Armenians living in Istanbul were not included in the deportation.I remember clearly that they used to say the number was 500.000 in early 2000s then it became 750.000 , 1 million and now they say 1.5+ million. 10 years later they will say 2 million was killed. I'm not saying that if its 500.000 it doesn't count as genocide or smt like that. It is just that when you see these false claims you just lose your credibility and give an image that the issue is more like a political tool and not sincere. If you pay attention closely, you see that Armenian genocide is always brought to the table when Turkey is having problem with USA and Europe. They dont actually care about Armenians, they just use it as political leverage against Turkey when it suits to their interests and put it to shelf when they dont need anymore until next problem comes along. I truly hope that one day Armenia and Turkey would solve their problems, open the borders and look at future together without any western intervention.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/l1ffri/no_repentance_nor_apologies_for_colonial_abuses/gk1jntd/,dani626263,1611217305

1417,"I'm not so optimistic about healing quickly. Trump did a lot of damage to the institutions he was directly in charge of and centuries of regulatory experience just vanished basically overnight. Think high level but unappointed members of the environmental protection agency who quit because their boss became an infamous climate change denier who demanded they regulate everything to the whims of big oil. That kind of thing happened a lot because Trump honest to god believed that the government didn't do anything so he didn't bother to send anyone to learn how the various executive agencies actually work, and when he realized that the government actually does stuff, he decided to ""run it like a business"" where profit trumps everything. We also still have all the underlying causes of Trump. Also don't underestimate the sheer number of broken families these past 4 years have caused. It's a lot.

That said, you're right otherwise. The fact that the US didn't become authoritarian is a testament to how well the system actually works. This was the culmination of 60/40/30 (which it is depends on who you ask, but Goldwater reviving populism, Reagan creating the modern conservative movement, and Gingrich and McConnell weaponizing rhetoric and political processes respectively) of the populist movement, and it went out with a whimper. As a terrorist attack the 6th was great. They almost got to members of congress where they could have executed some while livestreaming (presumably the plan based off of equipment brought), they attacked a symbol of the government, and it's all anyone is talking about at all. As a way to maintain power though? Incredibly flawed with basically no chance to work (like 0.01% levels here). Delaying the certification of the election just doesn't actually give Trump power unless he can do it indefinitely, and even then it only maybe gives him power. The election fraud stuff was also just stupid. The courts have consistently ruled that votes cast in good faith by eligible voters count. Never in a million years were they going to throw out millions of ballots because they were done via a system that the populace was told was okay because maybe ~0.1% of the votes would come in after election night. Also keep in mind that the election ending by election night has exactly zero legal basis and is just not how US elections work in general.

There's also good news on the underlying causes front. At the moment all these subversive tactics are only really used by the GOP, and when you look at the ideology of American voters at various ages, it is abundantly clear that the GOP and most moderate democrats will be completely unelectable in ~20 years. The older voters need to die for it to happen, but millenials and gen Z are significantly to the left of both parties socially. Fiscally it's more varied, but we're basically choosing between textbook neoliberalism and neoliberalism but we get tax cuts, so it's kind of a wash.

1461,"I think you are missing /s in your post. What supporting war in Iraq and alleged prosecuting communists has to do with socialism?

The first troops were sent to Iraq by the Polish government in 2003, this may be surprising to you, but back then SLD had majority in the parliament and Aleksander Kwaśniewski was the president. SLD stands for Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej which can be roughly translated as Democratic Left Alliance. Kwaśniewski was former member of SLD and ran for the president supported by this party. SLD is officially socialist party and is actually continuation of PZPR (Polish communist party). Fun fact is that currently SLD is more democratic and way more liberal both in economic and worldview terms than PiS.

As to the prosecuting of communists. PiS is only prosecuting these communists who oppose them. They created IPN (Institute of National Remembrance) which is highly politicised institution whose main goal is to oppress PiS opponents. At the same time many essential PiS members were communist apparatchiks, e.g.:

* Stanisław Piotrowicz who was prosecutor during martial law ni years 1981-1983, prosecuting opposition
* Andrzej Kryże who was judge convicting opposition

Here you may find more of them: [https://koduj24.pl/maria-nurowska-stworzyla-liste-politykow-pis-zasluzonych-pzpr-owi/](https://koduj24.pl/maria-nurowska-stworzyla-liste-politykow-pis-zasluzonych-pzpr-owi/)

And even more of them like Krystyna Pawłowicz were in some less oppressing communist structures (i.e. youth clubs).

And yes PiS are socialists, national socialists to be more precise. PiS despises and oppresses private enterprises, strives for nationalisation of companies (which they call repolonisation), rises the taxes and introduces extensive social programs (mostly to buy votes). Not to mention that they are using national television for their propaganda and oppress all free media that don't follow PiS policies.",,/r/europe/comments/l15zle/do_europeans_think_the_us_system_works_well_or_is/gk1ccil/,Malleus--Maleficarum,1611210704

1493,"History teacher here: it’s very complex but you can break it down pretty much into a few points. 
1) antisemitism was very widespread especially in the Holy Roman Empire since the Middle Ages. It was just normal to blame Jews for everything. It Kind of started when the church said that Christians weren’t allowed to get interest off of loaned money but Jews could. So many Christians envied Jews because they became rich. Stereotypes grew out of that and they are still here today.
2) Germany lost WWI. The German government told the people that they didn’t lose the war because of military and economic reasons but because of the socialists and Jews. They ‚stabbed the army in the back‘ that’s why this conspiracy theory is called ‚stab-in-the-back-myth‘ (Dolchstoßlegende in German).
3) many people believed there was a Jewish conspiracy that the Jews (in German Weltjudentum) want to take over the world. Nazis thought that they have to kill all Jews to stop this, that’s what Hitler also wrote in his book. And of course this is also what he preached. 
I hope that helps you understand a little better because this topic is so complex.

1510,"&gt;So you are saying that it is ok that each vote is not worth the same?

How does each vote not count the same? The winner of the president is the winner of 50 separate elections with 50 separate standards, with each participants election value being weighted by population, so larger states have more power while still not being able to dictate to the smaller states. I realize that the concept of a state in the US is not very well understood by most people not in the US, I would point you towards the articles of confederation that were in place before the constitution, which overly empowered the states to make decisions and lead to a whole other set of problems that brought about our constitution as we know it today.

&gt;Even the same vote from the same person should not be worth the same just because they decided to move?

This makes no sense because you have not proven each vote isn't equal. You've made a claim then used it as evidence to support your argument, without even explaining why your claim is accurate.

&gt;See if the majority of people voted for something it shouldn't matter where they live because frankly every vote should count the same. Just because I like to live in the city should not mean that my vote should count less. Same if I decide to have a more tranquil live in the countryside should not mean that my vote should count more. 

The majority of people don't vote at all, so should no one win the election? This statement shows how little you actually know about the US political system. The constitution was designed to limit power at the highest level. The state and local elections were always meant to have a greater impact on the day to day life of an individual because individuals who live near each other have more similar needs and feelings. So with that in mind, empowering local and state governments was to allow for states to solve their problems as they see fit. 

&gt;It is broken if a majority of people can vote for one person and that person still doesn't get elected. 

Why is it fair to the rest of the country that chicago, new york, LA, san Francisco, and philadelphia get to select who the president is? Let them run their own cities into the ground with their shit ideas, I don't want to live in the homeless utopia of commiefornia and I should be able to stop them from forcing their garbage policies onto me.

&gt;You are also forgetting that most states have big cities AND rural areas. (almost every country has them) 

Yeah, except that a single urban center in the state of NY has enough population to out vote the rest of the state. So the people who live in 0.55% of the state dictate to the rest what is and isn't fair? That seems like a recipe for tyranny.

&gt;Of course each state is different and even each city or town is different and that's why each of those instances have a different governor.

Hence the need for governmental power to be most focused at the lower levels. If you need more evidence of the individual state powers, look at the drastically different responses to COVID.

&gt;Population or landmass has nothing to do with it. Would it matter if I lived in a similar sized and populated country?

So the person saying that each person should get one vote and that our system is broken because it doesn't meet thai imaginary standard you made up. They then will say that population doesn't matter? I hope I'm misunderstanding something because otherwise this comment makes no sense.",,/r/europe/comments/l15zle/do_europeans_think_the_us_system_works_well_or_is/gk0z0wv/,DJSalTNutz31,1611201902

1513,"It's a weird thing that it appears that the opinion that I am conveying isn't well liked, because this isn't controversial stuff and is the conclusion of many research articles on the topic. Obviously outside of domestic policy the President is more powerful, but domestically, just systematically, a PM has more checks and balances, and I don't think the security of having fixed terms really has that much sway. 

This is particularly the case as in all but the conservative party, changing leader isn't fixed in the parliamentary system, a vote of no confidence is always a possibility, but that would only ever happen if the party feels it can win a general election, it's a very risky strategy to employ and hasn't happened since 1979. 

I mean if you look at why PM's resign it also doesn't appear that simple. Blair turned back on an internal agreement to govern for almost ten years, he ran a very strong leadership, with limited cabinet power,  he was defeated 4 times in 10 years. One of those was purely symbolic, two were amendments, non of them were bills (In fact only brexit related bills under May and Johnson have been rejected since 1986). He left out of choice, he could have stayed on though there were tensions. 

Cameron, could have stayed on, he lost the referendum, so maybe a bit of pressure but he left with a standing ovation and at the time people expected him to stay on. After 6 years, and probably knowing how difficult brexit would be I suspect he knew it was a good time to leave. 

May lasted 3 and a bit years, again, no problem with strength until 2019 really and the brexit shenanigans. She did have some pressure as she wasn't polling great and called an miss-called an election she thought she'd win. She was the only one who was pushed, internally and externally, and because of the weakness of her minority government and the partizan nature of brexit she might not have survived a further vote of no confidence. 

But my point is, this pressure, I think it's overstated. I think I'm right in saying Theresa May is the first PM to resign (or to lose a vote of no confidence) to serve less than 5 years since James Callaghan (again in 1979). PMs don't get replaced very often, and are actually quite hard to replace. Were a PM to dig their heels in.

“For the first time since the Dodecanese (islands) in 1947, the national territory is enlarged by about 10%, with procedures completely based on the rules of international law,” said Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, addressing Parliament.

“The expansion of the waters to the West inevitably sends a message to the East. It shows that violence does not produce justice, but that – on the contrary – it is this law that produces peace,” he said, adding that the extension is “a clear message to those who are trying to deprive our country.”",Μακεδονία 👑,/r/europe/comments/l1qynl/greece_extension_of_territorial_waters_in_ionian/gk11grt/,chrRiscs,1611203291

&amp;#x200B;

As far as the Jews are concerned, I want to tell you quite frankly that they must be done away with one way or another…. We will principally have pity on the German people only and nobody else in the Whole World. As an old National Socialist I must also say: “this war would be only a partial success if the whole lot of Jewry would survive it. While we would have shed our last blood to save Europe…. Gentlemen, I must ask you to arm yourselves against all feeling of pity. We must annihilate the Jews, wherever it is possible, in order to maintain the structure of the Reich as a whole.” (Page 201 of *The Anatomy of The Nuremberg Trials,* by. General Telford Taylor)

“The reason, it became clear, was that the Nazi leaders, by order fear, and example, succeeded in convincing their followers that Slavs were indeed subhuman and, except for those who could be put to useful slavery, should be killed in such atrocious fashion as to incite a country-wide reign of utter terror. This required both indoctrination and training; as Smirnov put it:

And indeed, in order to murder millions of innocent and defenseless people, it was necessary not only to develop the technical formula of “cyclone A” \[Poison gas\], to construct gas chambers and crematory ovens, nor only to elaborate a procedure for mass shootings. It was also essential to educate many thousands who would carry out these policies not in the letter but in the spirit” – as stated by Himmler in one of his speeches. It was necessary to train persons deprived both of heart and conscience, perverted creatures who had deliberately cut themselves off from the basic concepts of morality and law.” (Page 313-314 of *The Anatomy of The Nuremberg Trials, by.* Telford Taylor)",,/r/europe/comments/l1hurc/europe_history_wwii_holocaust_wedding_rings_found/gk0lbbb/,klaffredi,1611194838

1656,"Your entire country was founded by British. Even your rebellion was crushed but Ottomans had to back down because of British. You have basically been founded as a small frontier by them to keep Turkey geopolitically in check.
Your entire success in the entire last millenia was Balkan War.
You didnt win in WW2 neither you could just hold Italians until Nazis came and Italia is a country that couldnt invade Ethiopia. From Nazis others saved your ass[again].

Ataturks house example is dumb as I didnt claim you were dependant on us.

Funny how you talk of arrogance.
In 1071 you arrogantly asked Alp Arslan ""where to accomodate the army in Persia"" after defeating him.

In Turkish War of Salvation(you call it Asia Minor Catastrophe now) you tried to swallow sth far beyond your limits and it created a chaos for your country in the following years. 

In 1974 you again arrogantly tried to get away with a coup and bind the Cyprus to your mainland and again expected Turks to suck it up. 

Turkey slapped you every time except for the Balkan war and you never gave up on the arrogance all these years.


Even today while Turkey is trying to form its own defense industry and currently achieved a %70 self sufficiency, your big brothers are arming you to the teeth and you are giving up your own sovereignity while doing so. You are still buying Rafales, f-35s and stuff. They literally occupied you while you were blinded by Turkish hate.

All those energy sources in the East Mediterranian EEZs. It isnt like you are going to be the ones to benefit from that. You are literally struggling for your European masters atm. 

Funny how your grand strategy has never changed towards the Turks for the last millenia. 
1000 years ago you called for the crusaders and they sacked your capital.
500 years ago you called for their aid to save your capital they failed you.
100 years ago you made a campaign with their equipments they put you in a horrible catastrophe.
50 years ago you thought you had their blessing and couped in the island they stayed silent to Turkey taking half of it.

Today here you are again thinking with their arms, equipments, supports and blessings you can ""make Turks know their places"" again. 
They will screw you one more time. Even right now they are screwing you. By buying their weapons you get indebted to them and you will be in need of their technical support for those weapons.

&gt;As you know Ottoman Empire was literally sick man of Europe and was in a really bad situation since 1800s. Especially due to French revolution we saw several ethnic groups within the empire rebelling against Ottomans like Greeks in 1821 and they managed to establish their country. Armenians observed that and they also began to rebel against Ottomans starting from late 1800s. However Ottomans managed to suppress that by using Kurds against Armenians. In 1915 Ottomans already lost the Balkan wars and everything was just falling part. During that time Armenians were trying to form their country in today's Eastern Turkey and this lead to conflict between Kurds/Turks and Armenians. The rulers in Istanbul thought that if they deport Armenians to somewhere else everything will be solved. Unfortunately during the deportation many Armenians died due to starvation, diseases and gang attacks by Kurdish/Turkish groups. Remainings managed to reach Syria and from there

Various states can and are moving to ranked choice voting - but try changing 1A in the US (which frankly has allowed the current system of two realities to flourish). It’s never going to change.

Most of our other democracies aren’t as f*cked as the US because of more sensible restrictions on 1A, such as limitations on hate speech.

Also a lot of firearms and stuff. 

That is not the most pretty picture of course but not all are criminal and most are considered as hard workers and good people.

1924,"&gt;You know it's kinda impressive to go about pretending that ""all are equal in the eyes of the law"" in America when you have the largest prison population per capita, and famously put black men in prison far more than any other member of your population, who are then utilized as free slave labour. Yeah you haven't even abolished slavery as the 13th explicitly states that slavery can be used as a punishment for crime

You are right, like I said, in many cases a racist juror or judge will let that racism reflect on the judging. In Denmark, it's the law that is racist, a juror or judge may not be, but that's not important as the sentencing will by default be racist, just like it says in the law. 

USA has a big prison population yes, which doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing. USA have long punishments, three strike laws and plenty of crime. That in itself is not an example of either a racist or a faulty system. Unlike in Denmark, USA has no law that is inherently racist. In 2019, 600 000 people went to prison in USA, in Sweden (my country), it was 10 790. Per 100 000 inhabitant, that equals 185 for USA and 105 for Sweden. All of a sudden the difference isn't that big right? It's not fair to compare the prison population without adjusting for the size of the population. And remember, Sweden is a lot more likely to give people probation, fines, and community service than USA. In Denmark the number is 76 per 100 000. [https://www.kriminalforsorgen.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/nordisk-statistik-2013-2017.pdf](https://www.kriminalforsorgen.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/nordisk-statistik-2013-2017.pdf) 

Yes, black people are more likely to go to prison, just like they are more likely to commit crimes. That is not inself racist, and the same thing is true in both Denmark and Sweden. And like I said, racist jurors and judges can let their own racism get in the way of a fair trial, in Denmark that can't happen because the trial will always be racist, since you have racist laws, unlike both Sweden and USA. People work in Swedish prison too for almost no salary, don't know about Denmark though. But ALL work in prison, not just black people, and they certainly don't have to work twice as much as white people, like would be the case in Denmark. 

I have never said that USA is treating their refugees well, but that is no excuse for Denmark to break basic human rights. Yes, America doesn't let children stay in detention centers with adults as it's a safety risk. Does children in Denmark stay in detention centers with fully grown refugees while awaiting deportion? That is an honest question, I actually don't know, don't know where to find the answer, and in some ways I'm a little scared to find out the answer. I'm normally quite right wing and anti-immigration, but even for me Denmarks solution to virtually every immigrant related problem sickens me. It could not be done in neither Sweden nor USA. But you're spreading conspiracies and lies. 160 people died during 13 years in these detention centers in USA, and they house between 30 000 - 250 000 immigrants at any time. It's normal that some people die for various reasons. Age, disease, suicide, just like in a Danish prison. It's a death rate so low it can't be properly calculated. 

But I'm curious to hear how Denmark deals with families in detention centers. I know your government tried to ship them to an isolated island where you normally test biological animal diseases like rabies and african swine plague, but thankfully scrapped it because you realised it was too expensive.

Honestly I'm not familiar with how we set this up to provide a real world example. But as an attempt to answer the point - it should be populated collaboratively between gvmt and opposition, and should consist of recognised experts in the subject - think academics rather than politicians.

&gt;I don’t want any of them having any direct say in things that directly affect my life.

Hate to say it, but elections are in fact other people having such a direct say. We can't live in a democracy without granting a certain amount of power over our lives away to the majority, that's pretty much the basis of the system. 

&gt;Also referendums create immense political pressure to enforce bad policies because “it is the will of the people”.

Something there doesn't add up, honestly. If the political will exists for the policy, and the people voted for representatives that endorsed the policy then the same 'will of the people' point is in effect regardless of a referendum vote. What a referendum will do is provide a clear answer to a particular question/policy from the electorate. If they are run properly then they are a very democratic tool. That's in the case of a non-binding referendum, if it is binding then it needs to be specific in terms of what is being removed or added (exact wording pretty much) and if it passes then this is basically considered done - most or ours are this type and we have had them with a specific line of the constitution cited to be removed and another line that will be inserted in its place.",,/r/europe/comments/l15zle/do_europeans_think_the_us_system_works_well_or_is/gjyewn5/,luka_sene,1611158669

2345,"Yes, we have a fuck ton of Venezuelans (myself included, living in Spain right now). But it's not because Spain is so cool to give away refugee status to everyone, but rather a mixture of different paths:

- Many Venezuelans have Spanish citizenship thanks to ancestors, as lots of Spanish people migrated to Venezuela after the civil war. This is how I'm legally Spanish despite being born in Venezuela.

- If you're fortunate enough to be in the middle class and 
you have some money saved, maybe you can invest in Spain buying a property or starting a small business. The amount needed to get a residence permit this way doesn't involve a lot of money. 

- studying in Spain. If you're a student, it's usually pretty easy to get a residence permit after you graduate. 

- work permit. Not really that common, but I do know a couple of Venezuelans that managed to find a job in Spain from Venezuela, and they could get a visa. 

- refugee status: way more difficult than people think. I do know a couple guys that got it, but these were students that were involved in the protests, and were imprisoned and tortured by the regime. They actually had to prove this in order to get refugee status.

- illegally: sadly, this is becoming the most common option for a lot of Venezuelans. Spain thankfully is not so tough on deporting immigrants, so most can stay in Spain, and after some years, if you can prove you were in Spain (even if illegally), they usually give you a residence permit. A lot of people simply ask for a refugee permit when they arrive in Spain, and since approving it takes a lot of time, they can't deport you in the mean time. If it gets denied, luckily you'll have been enough time in Spain to apply for a residence permit anyway. But it's quite tough in the meantime, as obviously you can't get a good job, or rent an apartment if you are here illegally, and they usually have to survive with whatever they can find.",,/r/europe/comments/l0n0l3/the_uk_will_introduce_a_new_visa_at_the_end_of/gjxq5ed/,alfdd99,1611144186

2436,"He won, but he lost the absolute majority in the Senate and he is extremely weakened. The government survived only because of the abstention of Italia Viva, Renzi's party, that pulled out of the coalition last week.

Moreover, the governing coalition has a majority in only 3 parliamentary committees out of 14 in the Senate, meaning they can do almost nothing without listening to Renzi. So, while Italia Viva's MPs will not vote a motion of no confidence, as we saw yesterday (the fall of the government means the risk of early elections and they would not retain their seats), they could theoretically stop any bill proposed by ""majority"" parties from being approved. The government now looks like a minority government, at least in the Senate.

2536,"If a person cannot fight off a virus it has more chances to mutate and for them to accumulate. average 2 mutations per month so if someone is sick 2 weeks probably only 1 mutation. sick for a month probably 2 mutations. Someone sick for 9 months 18 maybe 18 mutations. 

addtionaly if they are infected with different viarants at the same time or have fragments still in system from previous mutation, they can be taken up by the living virus joining mutations.

most mutaitons don't change anything important. some will weaken the variant in some way such as less infectious and so dies out.

others are of concern because they make it more infectious such as make people shed more virus - bigger 'dose' of virus more likely one is to become ill and with more severe illness. This is why even imperfect masks help to at least keep illnesses mild if not totally prevent illness. Others like the UK variant are better at attaching to cells. Then with the South African discovered variant they are worried the mutation has made it different enough that the current vaccines won't be as effective. If that proves true when testing is complete hopefully it will only make it a few percent less effective.

The same things that reduce spread like masks properly worn , distancing, hygiene, and limiting contact with people outside our households still help. The few people sick, the less chances to mutate into something worse before enough people can get vaccinated to reach herd immunity.",,/r/europe/comments/l0g6qp/new_coronavirus_variant_identified_in_german/gjxbcdy/,shallah,1611130026

One example was making the commieblock almost all gray (like middle of the spectrum) and then replacing all the balcony barriers with deep vibrant color tinted glass. It looked absolutely amazing. Simple, yet it works.

From cheaper solutions i saw a white/black commieblock (squares intersecting each other creating a pattern), with couple of windows marked around with different tones of orange. Again.

Those texts, strating with the Tanzimat decree were made in Turkish but also in French by the same adminitration to show to the other powers their willingness to modernize (and also in a way admit that they are a bit backward). The problem is that some of those reforms were well intended but had limited impact in their application. Other measures were important for diplomatic standing... but a new palace is costly and doesn't put more money in the budget. Some measures like selling some crown jewels didn't put enough money in the bank and it lead to the bankrupcy just a few years after the realization of this map. At the same time the rising tension in the regions lead to violent repressions which catched the attention of the Europeans powers, particularly under Abudlhamid II.

Another point is that a lot of them are small businesses and cant afford to decrease the advertising (on their storefront) and lose business to  with the area and more likely mistake them with apartments.

Ideally for buildings like I've described (10ish stories and below, business on the bottom floor) across atleast a neighborhood would be:

*unified awning structures
*color coded paint jobs color schemes for your particular business (orange for supermarket, light blue for offices,etc.)

It's as if people don't care that many small businesses often lose the bulk of their profit to marketing, sometimes even operating at a loss in the hopes that the client retention will lead them to profits again someday. 

What are we supposed to do? Turn to Google where every other marketer bids against each other and get extorted by them? I can't tell you how many businesses are running in this hamster wheel just to pay their Google ads and if they don't do it they simply go bust. 

Why should Google get the bulk of every businesses profits for the sake of a search listing? Remember way back when we could just put our business in the phonebook for a pittance and get calls? Those were the days man.

Google does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services.

3173,"&gt;At least in Australia, in a T-intersection the non-continuing road gives way by default.

I can't really imagine this in real life. There are many many cases when priority road bends say 90° and other, smaller road joins it as if the priority road continued straight.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Mecklenburg-Vorpommern State Parliament voted last week to create its own foundation for the further construction of the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, with the coalition caucuses of the SPD, CDU and even the Linke all voting for this option. The AfD party withheld its vote. 

&gt;The official title of the new entity will be **Foundation for Climate and Environmental Protection MV** and funded with a working capital sum of €200 000. Nord Stream AG has pledged an initial amount of €20 million to be followed by another tranche of €60 million over the long term.

&gt;The overriding purpose of the foundation is to encourage climate and environmental protection projects. However it can also become commercially active in the support of the further construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, US sanctions notwithstanding.

3289,"I wouldn't call the war time transactions trade as they were largely donations from the US and seizing from the colonies.

For example:

&gt;Author and researcher Madhusree Mukerjee, who has served on the board of editors of Scientific American, writes in *Churchill’s Secret War: The British Empire and the Ravaging of India During World War II*, that the “colony’s entire output of timber, woollen textiles and leather goods, as well as three quarters of its steel and cement, were diverted to the defence of the British Empire. India was, next to Britain, the largest contributor to the Empire’s war”.  
&gt;  
&gt;During the war, India provided 196.7 million tonnes of coal, 6 million tonnes of iron ore and 1.12 million tonnes of steel. The Oxford Encyclopedia of Economic History, Volume 2, says: “35 per cent of India’s annual cotton textile production, amounting to about 5,000,000,000 yards, went into creating war material.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Timber was a major war input and its export led to large-scale destruction of India’s extensive forests. The Energy and Resources Institute says, “During World War I, forest resources were severely depleted as large quantities of timber were removed to build ships and railway sleepers and to pay for Britain’s war efforts…World War II made even greater demand on the forest than World War I had done.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The United Nations’ Food &amp; Agricultural Organisation concurs: “The first era in deforestation was shortly after absorption into the British Empire. The second major deforestation was in the 1940s with demands of World War II.” As for armaments, The Oxford Encyclopedia of Economic History, Volume 2, says: “During World War II, India produced more than 50 kinds of arms and ammunition and supplied 75 per cent of its own wartime requirements.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Bengal had a bountiful harvest in 1942, but the British started diverting vast quantities of foodgrain from India to Britain, contributing to a massive food shortage in the areas comprising present-day West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar and Bangladesh.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the backdrop of recent British overtures towards India, Britain’s racist and unbelievably callous attitude towards Indians needs to be studied and understood.  
&gt;  
&gt;With foodgrain being diverted to the war effort in Europe and Bengal’s transportation system grinding to a halt, people had neither access to food close by nor the means to go about their livelihood to earn or purchase whatever little food they could. In July 1943, the Board of Economic Warfare, a US government body, published a document, Indian Agriculture and Food Problems, which predicted famine and “hundreds of thousands of deaths from starvation”.",Europa,/r/europe/comments/l0o99w/european_domination_of_uk_trade_has_been_the_norm/gjurqnr/,dothrakipls,1611079875

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian\_profanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_profanity)

&gt;Profanities in the original meaning of *blasphemous profanity* are part of the ancient tradition of the [comic cults](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Comic_cult&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1), which laughed and scoffed at the deity.[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_profanity#cite_note-50) In Europe during the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages),  the most improper and sinful ""oaths"" were those invoking the body of  the Lord and its various parts – as the expression of the dialect of [Bergamo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergamo) *pota de Cristo* (""Christ's cunt"") – and these were precisely the oaths most frequently used.[\[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_profanity#cite_note-51)   
&gt;  
&gt;Nowadays, the most common kind of blasphemous profanity involves the name of God (*Dio*), Christ (*Cristo*), Jesus (*Gesù*) or the Virgin Mary (*Madonna*) combined with an [insult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insult) or sometimes an animal, the most used being *porco* (""pig"") as in *porco Dio* (""God is a pig"") or *cane* (""dog"") as in *Dio cane* (""God (is a) dog"") or *porca Madonna* (""the Virgin Mary (is a) pig"").   
&gt;  
&gt;Common blasphemous profanity in Italian are: *porco Dio* (often written *porcodio* or also *porcoddio*), *Dio cane* (lit. ""God (is a) dog""), *Dio merda*, *Dio bestia*, *Dio maiale*, *porco Gesù*, *Gesù cane*, *Madonna puttana*, *porco il Cristo*, *Dio stronzo, Dio Fauss (*or *Dio Fa',* more colloquially)*.*   
&gt;  
&gt;In some areas of Italy,[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_profanity#cite_note-nov-52) such as [Veneto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto), [Friuli-Venezia Giulia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friuli-Venezia_Giulia), [Umbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbria), [Marche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marche), [Lazio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazio), [Abruzzo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abruzzo), [Emilia Romagna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilia_Romagna), [Piedmont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont), [Lombardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombardy) and [Tuscany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscany), blasphemy is more common, but not because of a strong anti-Catholic feeling.\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\]. [Tuscany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscany) and [Veneto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto) are the regions where *bestemmiare* is most common, and in these areas blasphemy appears in the everyday speech almost as an *ordinary* [interjection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interjection).[\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_profanity#cite_note-53) The historical reasons for this are the various conflicts that these two regions have had with the Vatican",Lazio,/r/europe/comments/l0gvco/not_mine_but_since_austria_posted_i_think_it_fits/gjubvj6/,drew0594,1611072710

Governments come and go, politicians rise and fall: the Crown is always there. A legitimate Monarch moreover has no need to justify his existence, since he is there by natural right. He is not impelled as usurpers and dictators are impelled, either to mesmerise his people by a succession of dramatic triumphs, or to secure their acquiescence by internal terrorism or by the invention of external dangers.

There are various shades and it just so happens that the particular arrangement of EM spectrum with red wavelengths removed is perceived by our eyes as cyan. But you are also true that 490–520 nm is also perceived as cyan, just a different shade. 

If you want to read up further on this, read about CMYK colours, a complement to RGB colours.

Either way, how else would you define the opposite of red? One might say that the opposite of red light is the type of light that, when added to red gives the null element - black light.(That is the literal definition of an opposite element in linear algebra) There is no EM spectrum colour that, when added to red, gives no light.

3793,"First, just to clarify what I meant about using extremism to combat extremism; banning religions would be a very extreme response, I think. Banning any religion would, no matter the reason.

As for your questions! I don't consider atheism as a religion, and the same goes for agnosticism. I believe that in a well-educated and open society people will naturally gravitate towards atheism -- as I think we've seen in Europe throughout the 20th century.

I do think that secularism did change the environment quite a lot! I think the church and the Bible kind of outlived it's purpose as our societies grew more and more complex, so it'd be detrimental to have the church interfere in issues concerning the government. At worst they'd be a brainwashing element. It's kind of why it's worrying to see what Erdogan is doing in Turkey. Turkey was secularized and they seem to be undoing that under Erdogan. How it'll play out we'll have to see, but I don't think it'll change things for the better. 

With that said, in spite of the problems we've seen from Islamic extremism, I don't think that banning the religion is the way to go. It'll just incite more violence.

The people who told me you can't have free speech were concerned we would all accuse each other of  being pedophiles (Musk style lol).  Ironically when no one dared write about Prince Andrew and the allegations of underage sex, the same people wondered what happened to free speech...

People need to have a long hard think about whether they really support free speech and what that means.  Let's be grown up when it comes to allowing people to share views we don't like.

European side is very large and extensive so I would break it to three main areas. 

1) Touristic area: this is the area where every foreigner makes connection when hear Istanbul; like Historic peninsula where Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi palace are; Taksim Square, Karakoy Galata Tower etc. This area is full of hustle and bustle.

2) Mid-Mid/high level income Istanbulites lives: Places like Besiktas, Sisli, Bakirkoy etc. This places has their own hustle however nice places to live in. Most of the foreigners/toruist doesn't even know these places because they are rather less touristic and more for locals. This parts are much better places than number 1 listed areas.

3) Rest of Istanbul/Suburbs; these areas are where low-mid income people lives. Mostly concrete jungle, not attractive places. 

&amp;#x200B;

Asian side can be divided into three as well;

&amp;#x200B;

1) Kadikoy; as you mentioned, more like Brooklyn with its own characteristic. Rather touristical nowadays. Lots of hippies, artists, white collars beside your regular joes with mid-mid/high income. nice place.

2) Bosphorus shore of Asia; very nice and undiscovered parts of Istanbul by tourists. Kind of similar to Number 2 mentioned for European side. Mid-mid/high income to very high income people lives. Like Uskudar, Beykoz etc. Additionally South eastern shores of Istanbul has calm livable districts. 

3) Rest of Asian Istanbul/Suburbs; same like European side low income districts.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**One by one, these are the ten measures that will tighten the confinement**
&gt;
&gt;*The Government tightened the confinement to ensure that the Portuguese really stay at home. One by one, get to know the ten measures announced this Monday by António Costa.*
&gt;
&gt; The prime minister is not satisfied with the weak adoption of the confinement by the Portuguese, after the data point to a reduction of mobility of only 30% at the weekend, compared to the previous weekend. For this reason, António Costa announced this Monday a dozen measures that aggravate restrictions and impose confinement:
&gt;
&gt;1. The sale or delivery of products to the wicket is prohibited in any establishment in the non-food sector , such as in clothing stores;
&gt;2. The sale or delivery of any type of drink, even coffee , to food establishments authorized to take-away is prohibited ;
&gt;3. It is forbidden to stay and consume food, at the door or on the public road, or in the immediate vicinity , of food establishments;
&gt;4. All dining spaces in shopping centers are closed , even those that could operate on a take-away basis ;
&gt;5. All balances, promotions and sales campaigns that promote the displacement or concentration of people are prohibited ;
&gt;6. It is forbidden to stay in public leisure spaces, such as gardens, which can be visited, but cannot be places of stay;
&gt;7. Mayors are asked to, as in March and April 2020, limit access to places of high concentration of people, such as sea fronts or riverside, and limit the use of garden benches and playgrounds, and individual sports venues, like tennis or paddle tennis ;
&gt;8. All senior universities, day centers and social centers are closed;
&gt;9. The mandatory teleworking is reinforced in two ways: on the one hand, all workers who have to travel to provide face-to-face work need a credential issued by their employer, on the other hand, all service companies with more than 250 workers have to send ACT a nominal list of all workers whose face-to-face work they deem indispensable;
&gt;10. The ban on movement between municipalities at the weekend is restored and all establishments of any nature must close at 8 pm on working days, and at 1 pm on weekends, with the exception of the food retail, which on weekends may be extended until 5 pm.
&gt;
&gt;In addition to these ten measures, the Prime Minister said that they will be “accompanied by the reinforcement of supervision by ACT and also by the security forces, who have been determined - and especially in the PSP - to increase their visibility. presence on public roads ”.
&gt;
&gt;According to António Costa, this increase in visibility will have a greater incidence “in the vicinity of school establishments, in order to be a deterrent and to prevent gatherings that are a threat to public health”.
&gt;
&gt;At this point, however, there is still no perspective on when these ten measures will actually come into effect. The Prime Minister said that the decree-law is being finalized by the Government and will then be sent to the President of the Republic. After its promulgation, it will be published in the Diário da República and enter into force. But there will be some time between the announcement and the entry into force for the Portuguese to adapt, promised the ruler.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/l011zl/portugal_has_announced_extra_measure_to_help/gjsnp4l/,duisThias,1611029375

Puerto Rico just apparently just writes the text in Spanish instead of English.  Guess you'd just go by the rest of the sign, which is the same as elsewhere around the US.

IIRC Quebec does the same thing, but with French instead of English.

*googles*

Hmm.  No.  Apparently they use an inconsistent mix that apparently resulted from a spat over bilinguialism, which I suppose is about par for the course for Quebec.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_Canada

&gt; In Quebec, modern signs read either Arrêt or Stop,[4] however it is not uncommon to see older signs containing both words in smaller lettering, with arrêt on top.[5] Both stop and arrêt are considered valid French words and the Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF) notes that the use of ""stop"" on stop signs is attested in French since 1927.[6] In practice, however, it can be empirically observed (for instance, with Google Street View) that arrêt predominates in French-speaking areas (i.e., most of the geographic extent of Quebec), while stop can be found in majority English-speaking areas such as Montreal's West Island suburbs. At the time of the debates surrounding the adoption of the Charter of the French Language (""Bill 101"") in 1977, the usage of stop on the older dual-word signs was considered to be English and therefore controversial; some signs were occasionally vandalized with red spray paint to turn the word stop into ""101"".[7] However, it was later officially determined by the OQLF that stop is a valid French word in this context, and the older dual arrêt + stop usage is therefore not considered bilingual but merely redundant and therefore deprecated (à éviter). All newly installed signs thus use either one word or the other, but not both.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/l007sb/ireland_just_doing_its_own_thing/gjsed67/,duisThias,1611024367

London has cemented its role as Europe’s leading tech hub after a near-record year of investment as overseas investors circle in on the capital’s best firms.

Global tech investors are piling into the capital with a total $10.5bn (£7.7bn) investment recorded in 2020, a quarter of Europe’s whole VC investment for the year. 

Read more: Technology companies dominate list of best places to work in the UK

The amount raised is significantly more than the raised in 2017 and 2019 – $7bn and $5.9bn respectively –  and three times the amount of investment than any other European tech city. 

It is also catching up with its global peers, featuring as the second fastest growing global tech hub since 2016 and ranking 5th on the worldwide list for VC tech investment over the past five year.

The research from Dealroom and London &amp; Partners shows that it is in large part because non-European investors are flocking to London. 

Non-European investors accounted for 57 per cent of all tech VC investment into London with international investors having a preference for the capital. 

Investors from North America unsurprisingly represented the largest share of venture capital funding into London between 2019 and 2020. 

“The London tech ecosystem continues to mature and build recognition on the world stage,” chief executive of London VC firm Augmentum. “This latest data comes as no surprise to us, as it has been impossible to ignore the increased engagement from overseas investors – particularly from the US and Asia – seeking exposure to high potential tech businesses.” 

It is a sign of optimism for the city after what has been a long and torrid year as the pandemic mixed with Brexit uncertainty has derailed confidence.",,/r/europe/comments/l052pf/global_investors_flock_to_london_in_golden_age/gjriyft/,quixotic_cynic,1611007705

“It’s brilliant to see how resilient London’s tech sector has been, despite all the challenges of 2020. International investors have shown real confidence in London, with new venture capital funds setting up here to invest in high-growth companies in sectors like fintech, cybersecurity and healthtech,” said Laura Citron, chief executive of London &amp; Partners. 

Investment prospects for London firms will likely be further boosted by an increase in the number of VC funds in the city. 

London firms raised $7.8bn in new funds last year, on top of the $4bn raised in 2019, which accounts for a third of all new European funds over the past two years. 

**Fintech leads London’s innovation**


London’s growing fintech industry will no doubt have a strong part to play in London’s burgeoning role as a tech hub having raised $4.3bn in 2020 alone. 

“The past twelve months have seen a dramatic acceleration in digital adoption in the wake of the pandemic and fintech challengers will continue to play a crucial role in supporting economic recovery in the capital and beyond,” says Levene. 

Some of the biggest funding rounds this year have been the big fintech players such as Revolut’s $500m Series D round. Some other big deals involved KI Insurance – $500m – Checkout.com – $150m – and Gocardless – $95m. 

But Russ Shaw CBE, founder of Tech London Advocates has warned “now is not the time for complacency. We must be cautious of the challenges that lay ahead as the pandemic situation evolves and the true impact of Brexit is revealed.” 

“While these figures demonstrate the enormous potential of our tech scene – addressing issues on digital skills shortages, diversity and inclusion, and our pivot to a net zero economy remain critical.” 

Levene also expressed words of caution. “We expect a golden decade for European venture capital, although London must do more to build on its market leadership if it is to remain the leading European hub for tech by the end of this decade.”",,/r/europe/comments/l052pf/global_investors_flock_to_london_in_golden_age/gjrj1fy/,quixotic_cynic,1611007749

*shrugs*

I mean, I linked you to the economic rationale.  You are free to make a value decision that you personally want to sacrifice Sweden's wealth to address what you perceive to be issues in Indonesia.

My guess is that if you truly want to improve the standard of living of poor people in Indonesia, you'd be better-off just sending a subsidy to poor people in Indonesia.  I am suspicious that you're going to be disappointed when other countries export their refuse and so have lower refuse-processing costs than Sweden does.  But at the end of the day, if you truly place that intrinsic value there, I guess that's up to you.

&gt;You have smoking bans indoors in many locations despite the smoker suffering the worst of it.

I'd say that that's an argument *against* your point, not for it.

We have indoor (and near entrance/exits) smoking bans in the US because the smoke spreads through the room an impacts other people.  That's an externality, as the party choosing to smoke is affecting other parties who did not make that decision.

This is on par with the ""carbon dioxide emissions"" situation, where the externality exists.

We don't ban smoking if it's done outside and away from an entrance.  In that case, it diffuses, and there's little impact on other people, just the smoker.  That's akin to the ""local dioxide emissions hit local Indonesian farms"" situation that's described in the article.  There, the externality doesn't exist.

I think that the arguments for intervention surrounding nicotine have more to do with *addiction* and people making irrational decisions when addicted, but that's a different matter and doesn't really come into that example.

In this case, Indonesia has made a decision -- be it a good one or a bad one -- that accepting waste at the given rate is a worthwhile tradeoff.  They could impose more processing on factories it as fuel.  They could prohibit import.  They could track the waste.  They could impose a surcharge and distribute the surcharge to people in the area affected.  Those are all decisions that Indonesia can make.  If they choose to make their call one way or another, that's Indonesia's call.

But it's not affecting the UK, so it doesn't make a lot of sense to have the UK making the decision to exclude Indonesia from the British plastic refuse market.

4369,"**How the FPÖ wanted to establish a blue bank**

FPÖ was hoping for a deal until the Ibiza video - Öbag boss Schmid in chat with Strache: ""Bank is on track - knock us in on your cause""

Vienna - The FPÖ has not buried its hope of finding a bank that will finance the party and all other right-wing parliamentary groups in the EU so quickly. The search lasted until shortly before the Ibiza video became known in May 2019, after which the turquoise-blue coalition under Sebastian Kurz (ÖVP) and Heinz-Christian Strache (FPÖ) broke up.


As reported, FPÖ protagonists have counted on the takeover of the Viennese private bank by the Slovak Arca Capital. They wanted to buy the majority from the shareholders Günter Kerbler and Hannes Kowar. Among the owners around the controversial Slovak billionaire Pavol Krúpa, the Freedom Party thought, one would get discrete loans in the millions and Europe's rights could finance their election campaigns. Of course, the banking regulator FMA thwarted the blue bill: It did not allow Arca as the owner, the deal failed in autumn 2018.

Kerbler and Kowar had no idea of ​​any of this, as they say.

Arca was advised by Sigma Investment, for whom Peter Sidlo (former FPÖ district council and later on the casino board) was responsible. In an interview (on the Ibiza case) he testified that he was ""too optimistic"" about the FMA. After the failure of the Arca transaction, they ""tried further"" and the result was an Arca stake of 9.9 percent in the Viennese private bank. He confirmed to the investigators that it was the idea that the FPÖ ""would have received credit lines for the above-mentioned purposes (including voter funding; note) if the takeover was successful"".

Johann Gudenus (FPÖ member of the National Council until May 2019) is also likely to have been interested in bank details. On October 9, 2018, he asked Sidlo ""which banking licenses"" are still available and whether other interested parties would be ""interesting"". Sidlo said it depends on who it is. In his testimony, he stated that they had considered who else would be eligible for the takeover. Sigma was commissioned by Arca until autumn 2019. All of this can be found in documents that DER STANDARD knows.


Gudenus apparently still dealt with the topic in March 2019. At the beginning of March he let his party friend and OeNB General Council member Sidlo know: ""I spoke to Thomas Schmid yesterday about the bank"". At that time, Schmid was still Secretary General in the Ministry of Finance and was about to become the sole director of the state industrial holding Öbag. It landed there on April 1, 2019.


What Gudenus and Schmid had discussed, Sidlo no longer knew what to say in front of the investigators.

Even as Öbag boss Schmid is likely to have dealt with the blue banking issue in some way. In any case, this suggests his message to Vice Chancellor Strache on April 29, 2019: ""Dear HC! Bank is on track - knock us in on your cause"", which Strache said with a ""Thank you!"" answered. What exactly was on track there? Sidlo couldn't explain it to the investigators; his lawyer points out that there is no investigation in the banking connexion.

And what does Öbag boss Schmid say about that? That cannot be determined: despite a number of inquiries, he was not ready to comment. The same goes for Gudenus. And Strache could not be reached either.

Sigma boss Markus Braun, like Sidlo before him, was asked by the parliamentary Ibiza-U-Committee about details around the Arca-Wiener private bank-topic by the Green-mandate Nina Tomaselli. For example, she wanted to know if there would have been a two percent contingency fee - if the deal had worked. Braun, Sidlo's brother-in-law and functionary in various FPÖ-related clubs that he does not see as FPÖ-related, was very eloquent in his questioning, but was rather taciturn on this topic. He found it ""touching that you are so interested in high finance,"" he once said, but referred to banking secrecy for details. In addition, the topic has nothing to do with the subject of investigation, as he said.

Maybe, it depends on the context. Anyway that's what you get for being a dictator that kills political opponents eh? People are gonna accuse you of murder

&gt;Imagine he dies from the thromb, aneurysm, heart attack or another sudden disease?

Nah not in that case. There would be some conspiracy theory fanatics maybe but yeah most people would accept that he just died. Anyway that's what you get for being a dictator that kills political opponents eh? People are gonna accuse you of murder

&gt;Poison accusations, and accusations of a coverup of the ""real"" reason by doctors

Nah. If the body is examinated by neutral experts that determine that there was no poisoning involved then no one would accuse Putin of anything.

&gt;Slip, fall and broke his neck? Setup

No. There would be some conspiracy theory fanatics but most people would just accept his death. Unless of course the circumstances where strange or suspicious. But hey that's what you get for being a dictator that kills political opponents eh? People are gonna accuse you of murder

&gt;If you disagree, you are not arguing in good faith man, I'm sorry.

To me it looks like you are the one arguing in bad faith dude. No one is just preparing for navalny's death to blame it on Putin. If the conditions of Navalny's deaths where perfectly normal and not suspicious/strange then no one would accuse Putin (except for nutjobs, but who cares about them?)

&gt;Then why do you think there is still doubt right now, after all the videos and other stuff?

Because of all the secrecy, denial and trickery involved? It's pretty obvious 

&gt;You are really overestimating how much people care

I think that yoy are underestimating how much people care about political murder. For Putin maintaining the illusion of democracy (for his people and for the world) it's really really important. 


&gt;Same doubt would still be there if he died in a Russian hospital.

Of course. Putin's shills would still say that he simply died and Putin has nothing to do with it, like they did several other times. But most people would still be angry, a lot. They would protest and protest. We could even see a Belarus style series of protests. And that's the last thing that Putin wants



&gt;As I said, you don't know what you are talking about, you just don't know Russia.

It looks like you don't know how a government acts lol. Russia works like any other government, they need to have the people's support. They need to be able operate with the indifference of the people. And it's hard to do that when people are angry because you just killed an important politician.

&gt;Check up followups to Navalny videos, where Russian bureaucrats give the most stupid and ridiculous excuses to the accusations, and either expect you to believe they earned in 10 years the amount of money they couldn't earn in their lifetime, or just don't give a fuck.

No one is going to protest because some asshole got rich through corruption. But a shit ton of people will protest if you openly kill a political opponent.

1. Being disingenuous around who these soliders were e.g British soldiers of Scottish descent rather than how he put it ""Scottish soliders, not British"" which is just wrong.

2. Of course being a nationalist stops one from understanding that Scottish people have been British for well over 200 years and people can see thinly veiled nationalism which most normal people ridicule.

Also, your point about all the downvotes being from unionists is highly unlikely. I'm sure many were but to say all were in a sub that has tens of thousands of different Europeans viewing everyday is sure to have some that disagree with him. Many of my continental friends know Scottish people are British and recognise that Scottish nationalists are just as bad as little englanders, uneducated and emotional, perhaps the only difference being in having blue face paint and bagpipes.

It's because  non-controlled political opposition is dangerous to the authoritarian rule.

Also, unless you believe he wasn't poisoned I think that would be clear proof that the Russian government doesn't like this man. The charge of embezzlement is extremely weird, and just seems like an excuse to arrest him.

 I agree that a stereotype of everyone being corrupt in Russia obviously not correct is, but an authoritarian state is perhaps more likely to be more corrupt due to the fact that government officials have far greater power than in a democracy.

2. Self determination of Crimea and Crimea secceonism (that's why in a legal sense Crimea declared independence and then joined Russia) - worked, mostly.

4. Secessionism of ""Confederaition of Novorosiya"" to basically split Ukraine in half - didn't work at all
5. They also tried to make Yanukovich as legitimate president-in-exile of the whole Ukraine - didn't work because nobody in Ukraine actually had any cult of personality around him and he had really low support.
6. Partitioning Ukraine into separate ""republics"" - worked partially, only for 2 regions in the east, and even Russia doesn't recognize them as independent.
7. Forcing Ukraine to adopt a new constitution while threatening full-scale invasion. The proposed constitution should give veto power to each region over international treaties - didn't work at all.

5045,"You confuse a suspended sentence with a probation period, these two are different, at least in the Russian legislation. The sentence is never spent before you actually go to jail. For example, if you are given a 2 year suspended sentence with a 5 year probation period, you have to follow the rules of your probation for 5 years, or else you go to jail for 2 years. You can even go to jail for those entire 2 years at the last day of your 5-year probation period and thus leave the jail 7 years after you were originally sentenced.

As for Navalny, his probation period was prolonged a couple of times ""to prevent him from breaking the law"" and was supposed to end on December 30, 2020. According to FSIN, he was charged for violating the probation period (by not showing up in Moscow) on December 29, 2020, but the charges were conveniently made public on January 14, the day after Navalny declared his return to Russia.","Russia, Nizhny Novgorod",/r/europe/comments/kzdfdd/alexei_navalny_bids_farewell_to_his_wife_yulia/gjp3146/,Dalnore,1610951192

The two *Capitani Reggenti* are usually translated as Captains Regent, i.e. those who keep and preserve the Republic, much like a queen regent does preserve and keep the throne while the king is underage. The *reggente* part is to be understood as a [present participle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participle#Latin_and_Romance_languages), something like ""preserving captains"". In fact, in official decrees and other documents they refer to themselves in the plural with the formula *Noi Capitani Reggenti la Serenissima Repubblica ...*, which could be translated as ""we the captains keeping/preserving the most serene republic..."".

They are to be considered a joint Head of State in two persons, not two distinct Heads of State, and in most official documents they are referred indirectly as The Regency, i.e. one single entity. They sit at the top of most institutions of the Republic, and among them the Congress of State, i.e. the executive branch, however they only act as moderators by chairing its meetings.

5144,"TLDR: Being in Russia is the only way he can make a real difference, and he loves Russia more than anything (except maybe his wife and kids).

There are a lot of bad takes here, imho (some good ones too). He went back out of a sense of patriotism and duty. His meaning in life is to do whatever he can to make Russia a freer, more democratic place, and he knows he would be instantly discredited by taking asylum somewhere. He's already constantly accused of being a CIA/NATO puppet. He is genuinely willing to pay with his life for his cause. 

The investigations that the FBK does, the circus that he creates, and the courage that he shows are excellent foils to United Russia and Putin. His team is fantastic at showing how corruption affects people's daily lives, and just how soulless United Russia are. There's a reason Putin has never said his name in public, not even once. There's joke in Moscow that if you want something fixed/cleaned up by the city, all you have to do is write his name on it, and it'll be done immediately. If Putin wasn't deathly afraid of him, he wouldn't have tried to kill him, he wouldn't have arrested the people that went to Vnukovo to meet him, he wouldn't have diverted his plane to Sheremetyevo, he wouldn't have arrested him in the airport, and he wouldn't denied his lawyer access to him. You don't do those things to someone you don't view as a threat. Navalny certainly wanted today to be a circus. Putin cares deeply about geopolitics, and Navalny forced him to look like a clown today. Navalny makes Putin look like a small coward. He branded Putin's party as the ""Party of Crooks and Thieves"", effectively. 

Navalny knows he wouldn't be able to make the same kind of difference abroad, and being an exiled dissident just isn't who he is. He knows the risks of coming back perfectly well. Being in Russia is the only hope he has at affecting change. I would also wager that he's betting the global stardom he's cultivated after the poisoning might save him. It very well might not, and he might be sent away to prison for a long time/ killed (he very well could be killed. It's difficult to predict what Putin will do backed into this kind of corner), but there would likely be huge political and economic consequences for Russia to pay. The EU has its new Magnitsky Act, the USA has theirs,  the pipeline to Germany is already under huge scrutiny, there are Duma elections in the fall, there's the situation in Belarus, the protests in Khabarovsk, etc... Putin has a tremendous amount to lose by doing something to him. Again, I'm not saying that will stop him, but it's not as simple as some in this thread make it out to be.

As an aside, I really wish people would dispense with the idea that Putin is some kind of omnipotent criminal mastermind. He's not. He's good at crafting a state propaganda-based image, seizing opportunities, and using the toolbox he has. The thing he's best at is stealing. Also, Russia is an authoritarian state, not a totalitarian one. In an authoritarian state, you get by by avoiding politics, letting those at the top pillage the country, and make the best of your circumstances. In a totalitarian state, every single action is political, you must be constantly loyal to the party, and you risk everything by doing anything less. Think Russia vs. China.

Just because Austria as a state is friendly towards the US (technically ""neutral"", but the Soviet Union regarded Austria as de facto NATO partners) does not mean individual Austrian people like the USA.


Obviously not all Austrians are US haters, it's a country not a hive mind, but you'll find that left-leaning Austrians hate the USA because the USA represents Capitalism, and because the USA's actions during the Cold War were often in opposition to Left wing groups. Ultra-far right Austrians (as in actual Nazis) also will hate the USA because they blame ""American degeneracy"" for exporting multiculturalism and liberalism to Europe.

5229,"&gt; is it a ""view"" to say borders are man-made? theyre imaginary lines

Well my point was that if you're taking that line of reasoning, then there's no point even discussing borders at all. But yes, we're in complete agreement that they don't actually exist.

&gt; but i just feel like, ""occupation"" for 7 years with no plan of giving back is just ownership not occupation. you can debate who it should belong to, but not who it DOES belong to (russia).

That's a reasonable argument.

The issue is that borders really only matter in terms of what other countries think, because that's how country's have any sovereignty at all in the first place. As we said above, borders aren't actually real, so they only gain importance based on how we humans use them. So in that sense, it only matters what the border is inasmuch as it matters what other countries recognize as the ""official"" border, because that determines how they act with regards to their aid and militarizes and alliances and treaties and such. So even though Russia currently occupies Crimea, the fact that the international community at large views that as an invasion means that they [the international community] won't treat Crimea as Russian, which defeats the whole purpose of having a border at all.",,/r/europe/comments/kzdfdd/alexei_navalny_bids_farewell_to_his_wife_yulia/gjoea1b/,exmachinalibertas,1610935973

5239,"I've just explained how it restricted our legislation.. And yes, most UK legislation was passed by the UK, now all of it will be, because no other body can legislate for the UK.

In short, the powers that were exercised by the EU for the UK now sit with the UK and are accountable to a UK electorate, we are not in a position where say a Conservative UK government can consent to something at the EU level and then a Labour government cannot change it..

And no, the Agriculture bill was not designed for a future US trade bill, and even if it were, it wasn't designed by the US, doesn't give them any powers to legislate and doesn't even begin to hand off powers to the US, or allow the US to regulate the UK market. Again, Eu membership did all of that.

As to the WTO, our power is equal to that of the EU or any other member. Within the EU the UK was one voice among 27, so it could maybe influence the EU, to then maybe influence the WTO.. I think a seat at that table makes far more sense than handing off a lot of control to a collective position within the EU.

And again, if the above is actually how you think the EU works, then you almost certainly have a skewed view of the costs and benefits of EU membership... The EU is quite a serious thing to be a member of, it takes a lot, member states have to hand off quite a bit of power, pool sovereignty and limit their actions to be EU members. That's how it works, that's how the benefits are derived.

Although in the context of the initial part of the thread, it would seem that the UK can, as an individual state gain the same trade benefits without being in the EU, and still run an independent trade and commercial policy, so maybe some of the benefits of EU membership have been exaggerated too.

The deflation in the past decade was enough to offset any money expansion. Seems weird for you to predict its the same is not going to happen with exactly no model to justify that.

US debt before was actually more manageable than ever as interest rates have fallen leading to incredible decrease in cost of borrowing.

5445,"Uff. Then here we go, again, just talking about germany/Austria, since I don't know enough to speak about Poland in this case.

I read in other comments from you that you are a carpenter? Do you have a degree, by which I mean did you visit a licensed school where your degree would be accepted in germany? Because that plays a big role on finding a job here. If you don't have one you will need to get it, without it you won't get a visa or even a job. (I don't mean a college degree, here in Germany it's called ""Berufsausbildung"", don't know the translation, bit to late for me to look it up)


Second, you said you are 21? Dude, that's to young, I should know. I moved to Dublin when I was 18, although I loved living there for a bit, it was unwise, I was too young to handle being on my own in a different country. Wait at least a bit.

Third. We have rural places here, sure. But Europe is still densely settled, so even our rural parts are not so rural as in the US, just a heads up on this part.

Fourth. You lean towards republican politics? Which exact way of republicanism, there is a variety. But none the less, what may be centre right politics in the US is in German, at least, considered far right and honestly not so much liked, especially by people our age. Me included 😅

Fifth, there is no such thin in Germany as ""loose gun laws"". You have the right to own a gun. In a steal Tresor, in your home, if you went through the process to get the license and the state acknowledges your reason to own a gun. It's possible, but we are far, far away from open carry, owning a rifle or even for every person to even buy ammunition.

If any of these are a reason for you not to move to Germany, then don't.

At that stage I think your body keeps some sort of template stored so it can quickly recreate these antibodies when subjected to the same virus again. 

The antibodies can be observed, the 2nd part is much harder how long that will last. That's however my limited understanding of it.

Hard pass. Some EU members demonstrated their value in the War on Terror and that was a disaster. The US fucked up most of the Muslim world and then just left. Now here we are with the migrant crisis, unstable neighbors, etc.

The non bailout rule of the maatricht treaty (which got initially included there as a German condition for the introduction of the euro) got undermined by that. Germany is indeed exporting too much due to a too cheap currency for its demand. But this goes on the expense of less domestic buying power (compared to a stronger currency) and less domestic investment.

They rushed their vaccine for approval before 3rd stage trials had concluded, just to be ahead of the west. They called it the Sputnik for nationalistic reasons.
