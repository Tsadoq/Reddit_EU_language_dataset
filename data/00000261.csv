50,"Dude, I'm a Russian who has never had a drop of alcohol or a cig or coffee. I do drink tea religiously though. However, just because I don't booze doesn't mean I miss the most essential part of Russian culture. Maybe I do, maybe I don't, but believe me, the Russian expats who know me, a Russian expat say I'm one of the most Russian people they know by character, if not by how I dress (super metro) or what I drink (I don't). 

Your soul is your soul, I've got a Russian one, I grew up Russian and that's all you need. You can't grow up a second time, but you don't need to drug yourself to immerse yourself in a culture. Coffee, alcohol and tobacco leave addicts in their wake. My mum is one, she can't function at all without 2-3 cups of coffee in the morning. It's frightening. I've seen far more functional coke addicts than her, I mean, she needs 2-3 hits every day, most coke addicts I know at least stick to weekends, I mean, for fuck's sake, we're not fucking animals who are given a pleasure button and die pressing it. 

Mormons are insane speaking as a history BA, their historical beliefs are the easiest part to prove the BS on, but it's really cool that Mitt went to France to preach. Even if he was a coddled and privileged child. 

OK, but I draw the line at sex. Drugs are bad, but sex and masturbation are the most natural stress relievers and healthy pleasure experience. I cannot fathom people who try to shame people for it. Part of why despite me being nearly a Mormon/JW in my habits (no music and dance for me either), I'm not one, because my sexuality is as unfettered as I feel it should be. Please, the world needs to fuck more (without the baby-part that is). Fuck everyone as long as it's consensual. Men, women, etc. People will feel better and have less hate.

I grew up in Ukraine for instance and yet no Russian can ever tell the difference -- people from Rostov sound more Ukrainian than most Ukrainians for one, and regional accents are poorly recognised by people in Russia.

We are currently in the final days. The tories have reframed all the NHS property and put in to a private company and adjusted the law so that if Health trusts dont sell off whats left they get their budgets cut.

Let's see, what used to work for converting people back when we were still in the Empire?  Lot of hellfire-and-brimstone stuff, right?  Maybe some Jonathan Edwards?

[From *Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God*, Reverend Jonathan Edwards, sermon preached July 8th, 1741](https://www.blueletterbible.org/comm/edwards_jonathan/sermons/sinners.cfm):

&gt;The use of this awful subject may be for awakening unconverted persons in this congregation. This that you have heard is the case of every one of you that are out of Christ.‚ÄîThat world of misery, that lake of burning brimstone, is extended abroad under you. There is the dreadful pit of the glowing flames of the wrath of God; there is hell‚Äôs wide gaping mouth open; and you have nothing to stand upon, nor any thing to take hold of; there is nothing between you and hell but the air; it is only the power and mere pleasure of God that holds you up.
&gt;
&gt;You probably are not sensible of this; you find you are kept out of hell, but do not see the hand of God in it; but look at other things, as the good state of your bodily constitution, your care of your own life, and the means you use for your own preservation. But indeed these things are nothing; if God should withdraw his hand, they would avail no more to keep you from falling, than the thin air to hold up a person that is suspended in it.
&gt;
&gt;Your wickedness makes you as it were heavy as lead, and to tend downwards with great weight and pressure towards hell; and if God should let you go, you would immediately sink and swiftly descend and plunge into the bottomless gulf, and your healthy constitution, and your own care and prudence, and best contrivance, and all your righteousness, would have no more influence to uphold you and keep you out of hell, than a spider‚Äôs web would have to stop a falling rock. Were it not for the sovereign pleasure of God, the earth would not bear you one moment; for you are a burden to it; the creation groans with you; the creature is made subject to the bondage of your corruption, not willingly; the sun does not willingly shine upon you to give you light to serve sin and Satan; the earth does not willingly yield her increase to satisfy your lusts; nor is it willingly a stage for your wickedness to be acted upon; the air does not willingly serve you for breath to maintain the flame of life in your vitals, while you spend your life in the service of God‚Äôs enemies. God‚Äôs creatures are good, and were made for men to serve God with, and do not willingly subserve to any other purpose, and groan when they are abused to purposes so directly contrary to their nature and end. And the world would spew you out, were it not for the sovereign hand of him who hath subjected it in hope. There are the black clouds of God‚Äôs wrath now hanging directly over your heads, full of the dreadful storm, and big with thunder; and were it not for the restraining hand of God, it would immediately burst forth upon you. The sovereign pleasure of God, for the present, stays his rough wind; otherwise it would come with fury, and your destruction would come like a whirlwind, and you would be like the chaff of the summer threshing floor. 
&gt;
&gt;The wrath of God is like great waters that are dammed for the present; they increase more and more, and rise higher and higher, till an outlet is given; and the longer the stream is stopped, the more rapid and mighty is its course, when once it is let loose. It is true, that judgment against your evil works has not been executed hitherto; the floods of God‚Äôs vengeance have been withheld; but your guilt in the mean time is constantly increasing, and you are every day treasuring up more wrath; the waters are constantly rising, and waxing more and more mighty; and there is nothing but the mere pleasure of God, that holds the waters back, that are unwilling to be stopped, and press hard to go forward. If God should only withdraw his hand from the flood-gate, it would immediately fly open, and the fiery floods of the fierceness and wrath of God, would rush forth with inconceivable fury, and would come upon you with omnipotent power; and if your strength were ten thousand times greater than it is, yea, ten thousand times greater than the strength of the stoutest, sturdiest devil in hell, it would be nothing to withstand or endure it.
&gt;
&gt;The bow of God‚Äôs wrath is bent, and the arrow made ready on the string, and justice bends the arrow at your heart, and strains the bow, and it is nothing but the mere pleasure of God, and that of an angry God, without any promise or obligation at all, that keeps the arrow one moment from being made drunk with your blood. Thus all you that never passed under a great change of heart, by the mighty power of the Spirit of God upon your souls; all you that were never born again, and made new creatures, and raised from being dead in sin, to a state of new, and before altogether unexperienced light and life, are in the hands of an angry God. However you may have reformed your life in many things, and may have had religious affections, and may keep up a form of religion in your families and closets, and in the house of God, it is nothing but his mere pleasure that keeps you from being this moment swallowed up in everlasting destruction. However unconvinced you may now be of the truth of what you hear, by and by you will be fully convinced of it. Those that are gone from being in the like circumstances with you, see that it was so with them; for destruction came suddenly upon most of them; when they expected nothing of it, and while they were saying, Peace and safety: now they see, that those things on which they depended for peace and safety, were nothing but thin air and empty shadows.
&gt;
&gt;The God that holds you over the pit of hell, much as one holds a spider, or some loathsome insect over the fire, abhors you, and is dreadfully provoked: his wrath towards you burns like fire; he looks upon you as worthy of nothing else, but to be cast into the fire; he is of purer eyes than to bear to have you in his sight; you are ten thousand times more abominable in his eyes, than the most hateful venomous serpent is in ours. You have offended him infinitely more than ever a stubborn rebel did his prince; and yet it is nothing but his hand that holds you from falling into the fire every moment. It is to be ascribed to nothing else, that you did not go to hell the last night; that you were suffered to awake again in this world, after you closed your eyes to sleep. And there is no other reason to be given, why you have not dropped into hell since you arose in the morning, but that God‚Äôs hand has held you up. There is no other reason to be given why you have not gone to hell, since you have sat here in the house of God, provoking his pure eyes by your sinful wicked manner of attending his solemn worship. Yea, there is nothing else that is to be given as a reason why you do not this very moment drop down into hell.
&gt;
&gt;O sinner! Consider the fearful danger you are in: it is a great furnace of wrath, a wide and bottomless pit, full of the fire of wrath, that you are held over in the hand of that God, whose wrath is provoked and incensed as much against you, as against many of the damned in hell. You hang by a slender thread, with the flames of divine wrath flashing about it, and ready every moment to singe it, and burn it asunder; and you have no interest in any Mediator, and nothing to lay hold of to save yourself, nothing to keep off the flames of wrath, nothing of your own, nothing that you ever have done, nothing that you can do, to induce God to spare you one moment.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7toy5a/american_christian_missionary_goes_to_serbia_nis/dte5j2p/,vokegaf,1517192272

*If the writer were as well acquainted with Turkey as I am he would know that the life and property of a Christian subject of the Sultan are safe nowhere in the Ottoman Empire. For him there is no justice even in Constantinople. His life, property, honour are ever at the mercy of the meanest Mussulman who may choose to assail them. He can never prove that he has been wronged, for his evidence is inadmissible against a Mussulman. Nor, if he could prove it, would it make the smallest difference; for although the rayah has some theoretical rights under Mussulman rule, these rights are of no sort of use to him, since he can never enforce them, and the violation of them is not punishable by law. The sacred law of Islam forbids the murder of a rayah who has paid his yearly ransom for the right to live, and is otherwise innocent; but it declares at the same time that if, nevertheless, a true believer should deliberately kill a rayah the murderer is not to be punished in any way. And he never is punished*

*Purely Christian evidence is inadmissible, and a Muslim will not give evidence in favour of a Christian against a true believer; nor, as I have just explained, would it be of any use if he did. The plain truth is that Mussulman rule over non-Mussulman subjects is so abnormally iniquitous, so utterly repugnant to natural justice, that people are exceedingly slow to believe that such wickedness can exist under a Government which has its metropolis in Europe, and which the Christian Powers treat as if it were a civilised State. The very enormity of its offences against the primary conditions of civilised life is thus its strongest panoply against the indignant retribution of Christendom. If Christian Europe only realised that the government of Turkey is, in literal fact, an organised brigandage, under the cruel yoke of which the fairest and richest regions of the globe lie desolate, and human life has for centuries ""groaned and travailed in pain together until now,"" it would soon put an end to the disgrace of allowing a horde of barbarians like the pashas and effendis of Stamboul to keep the civilised world in perpetual turmoil by the incorrigible infamy of their rule.*

*Let me glance briefly at the principal disabilities under which the Armenians, in common with all the non-Mussulman subjects of the Porte, lie without any hope of redress, unless the Powers which undertook to protect them in the Treaty of Berlin compel the Sultan to fulfil his Treaty obligations. Their evidence is inadmissible against a Muslim. They are forbidden to have arms of any kind. They are obliged by law to give three days' gratuitous hospitality to any Mussulman official or traveller who demands it: officials including soldiers, police, and tax-collectors; and travellers, anybody from a pasha to a beggar. These hateful guests demand the best rooms and food in the house, and do as they please with the women. The men are helpless, for they have no arms, while their unwelcome guests are armed to the teeth; and if they presume to complain to any of the local authorities they are beaten or probably cast into prison. The peasantry pay their taxes in kind, which amounts in all to more than 60 per cent of the produce. The tax-collectors are, as a rule, and in direct violation of the Sultan's engagement in the Hatti-humayoun of 1856, the police, who are among the most unmitigated ruffians on the face of the earth. The taxes are put up to auction, and so keen is the competition that the successful competitor not unfrequently pays more than the total value of the taxes. To recoup himself and make a profit in addition, he has recourse to the most grinding extortion. He quarters himself and his tribe of tax-collecting police on the unhappy villagers, and will not allow the harvest to be gathered till he has been bribed all round. The rayahs are, in addition, subjects to forced labour at the bidding of the local authorities and landlords. They are obliged to wear a peculiar dress, to mark them off from the Muslims. They are forbidden to ride horses, but may ride donkeys, from which, however, they must dismount when they meet a Muslim, and bow low with downcast look while the true believer, who may be a beggar, passes, while the Christian may be a nobleman or an archbishop.*

*But we read and hear much about the extraordinary toleration of the Turkish authorities towards other creeds. Let us see what that toleration is. By the unchangeable law of Islam, Jews are forbidden to build synagogues and Christians churches. They may repair old buildings, but on the same site and of the same dimensions. And even for this they must obtain a firman from Constantinople, which means a series of bribes and a delay of months, perhaps of years. The churches must have no bells, for fear of offending the religious sensibilities of the Mussulmans; and for the same reason there must be no loud singing inside churches or synagogues, or lamentation or singing at funerals.*

*Although the building of places for public worship is by the sacred law of Islam forbbiden to Jews and Christians, the authorities, from 1856 to 1891, winked at meetings for worship in private houses. In the latter year the local authorities prohibited this scanty privilege; and in January 1892 an Imperial Edict was published, ""decreeing the suppression of worship and schools not formally authorised and found to by without permits after, a stipulated delay."" This decree, however, was not at once strictly enforced. It was a feeler to test the forbearance of the Powers. There being no protest from any quarter against this outrageous violation of the solemn promise of toleration given by the Porte in the Hatti-humayoun, in 1894 the celebration of divine worship in private houses was peremptorily forbidden, on the ground that ""every place where a Christian says his prayers is reckoned as a church, and a church cannot exist without an Imperial firman.""*

*""Any passage from the Bible is prohibited which contains any of the following words: persecution, courage, liberty, strength, rights, union, equality, star* (in astronomy one has to use the word 'luminary' instead), king, palace, arms, bloodshed, tyranny, hero, &amp;c., &amp;c. These words are prohibited in religious articles in any context whatever. A Christian religious newspaper may not place before its readers a hymn or other poetry; and from the hymn-books used in Christian worship many of the grand old hymns of the Church have been expunged, and the suppression sustained after appeal to the highest authority of the Porte.""*

*This Hussein Agha was Mudir ‚Äî i.e., Governor ‚Äî of Patnoss in Armenia. The dry catalogue of his hideous atrocities and crimes fill a page and a half of the folio Blue Book. ""He carried off over 2600 sheep, nine horses, many cattle, and property of all sorts. He set fire to nine villages, killed ten men, and cut off the right hands, noses, and ears of eleven more, some of which could, if necessary, be produced as witnesses."" ""A year ago Hussein carried off and ravished five Christian girls from Patnoss."" In a dispatch to Lord Salisbury the British Ambassador denounces this man as ""a monster,"" and Lord Salisbury laid the dispatch ""before the Queen."" This ""monster,"" remember, filled the responsible post of Governor of a district where his word was law. Was any serious attempt made to punish him, or even stop his career of outrages? None. ""Protected as he is supposed to be by the authorities,"" says the British Consul, ""no one dares raise a voice against him. Such is the terror that he now inspires that the Murakhass (Bishop) of Alashgird has fled to Bayazid.""*

*The British Ambassador, by Lord Salisbury's instructions, denounced this notorious criminal to the Grand Vizier, and he was thereupon invited to visit the Sultan at Constantinople as a mark of special honour,* and promoted to the rank of a pasha and the command of a regiment of the Kurdish cavalry which the Sultan was then organising, and on which he bestowed the singular favour of bearing his own name, ""the Hamidie"" ‚Äî ""the King's Own,"" as we should say.
(*To achieve special notoriety by outrages on Christians, and then to be denounced by the British Government, is the surest passport to the Sultan's favour. It was just after he had been denounced to the Sultan by Lord Beaconsfield's Government ""in the name of the Queen,"" that Chefket Pasha, the butcher of Batak, was promoted to a high post in the palace and decorated.)*",,/r/europe/comments/7soprc/turkey_is_an_aggressive_neighbor_greek_pm_tells/dte6nhb/,HakobG,1517193588

294,"(cont.)
*The reader will remember that it was in the year 1892 that the Imperial decrees were published against education and Christian worship even in private houses. In the previous year the Sultan began to form his force of 30,000 Kurdish cavalry, whom he officered with the most notorious brigands and criminals in Kurdistan ‚Äî Hussein Agha among them. Representatives from the different regiments of these cut-throats were invited to visit the Sultan at Constantinople, where he had them f√™ted with every token of favour. On their return to Armenia they ""openly state,"" says the British Consul at Erzeroum, ""that they have been appointed to suppress the Armenians, and that they have received assurances that they will not be called to answer before the tribunals for any acts of oppression committed against Christian."" When everything was ready the Kurds were let loose on the helpless Christians, and the world was horrified by the massacres of Sassun, the rumour of which filtered through the cordon of troops and police with which the Sultan surrounded Armenia, and was revealed in all its horrors months afterwards by the enterprise of English journalists.*

*On discovering that his carefully prepared massacres came to light even in remote Armenia, the Sultan has adopted another method of ""diminishing"" the Armenians, and driving the survivors out of their ancestral home. The Kurds have been told to pasture their cattle in the meadows and cornfields of the Armenians. I state the following facts on the authority of Reuter's agent, whose impartiality has been generally acknowledged. He spent some months in Armenia this year, travelling about in disguise, and came to see me on his return last July. Wherever he went he saw the Kurds' cattle, tended by their herds, browsing in the fields of the Armenians, and was told by the Armenians that they durst not remonstrate or complain. The crops having been thus destroyed, the next thing was to rob the Armenians of their cattle and household goods. A year's taxation was demanded in advance. The wretched Christians pleaded poverty through the run of their crops. The rax-gatherer answered: ""You must pay at once."" ""Then give us a little time,"" implored the Christians, ""till we can sell some of our cattle."" The tax-gatherers, who are also the police, retorted by seizing all their cattle and household goods, and putting them up to auction: the neighbouring Kurds having been previously informed of the fact, while the Christians were forbidden to bid for their own property, which, after this sham sale, was divided between the Kurds and police. Thousands of Armenians have been thus reduced to feeding on roots and grasses for months, and crowds of them have perished from starvation and diseases bred by the garbage with which they have been endeavouring to keep soul and body together. Reuter's agent, a gentleman of independent means, and belonging to no political creed or party, showed me a sample of the cakes on which the starving Armenians had been feeding. It was a boiled concoction of roots, leaves, and grasses, and looked like a piece of concrete. ""I went to Armenia,"" said this gentleman, ""with my sympathies rather in favour of the Turks. I have come back with my blood boiling against their fiendish inhumanity. If the English people only realised the true state of the case they would not endure it for a week.""*

&gt;The republic of Turkey was a continuation of the Ottoman Empire. Similar to how the kingdom of France became the French Republic. And yes, such a revolution is bloody and brutal, but when you talk about French history

Stop trying to self-insert, their history is similar at all. The kingdom and republic of France were almost identical in borders and there was no other large native population the French destroyed.

&gt;No, they are not, and one short video doesn't change anything about that. Besides, saying something and actually doing it is a big difference.

The Turks today live in homes stolen from murdered Armenians, have a higher standard of living because of property stolen from Armenians, actively destroy all traces of Armenian civilization to this day, and openly mock and celebrate the Armenian Genocide. Never tell an Armenian that present-day Turks are innocent when they are as much of invaders and occupiers as they always have been.",,/r/europe/comments/7soprc/turkey_is_an_aggressive_neighbor_greek_pm_tells/dte6npt/,HakobG,1517193596

446,"President elections are about the person, not the party backing the candidate. President when elected is expected to resign from any political parties they are affiliated with, and since Niinist√∂ was being re-elected, he actually didn't directly have any political party supporting his run, but his old party didn't nominate a candidate of their own, thus giving indirect support for him.(His old party was National Coalition Party, the most economically liberal party of Finnish politics)

President is expected to handle foreign policy with very little power over domestic matters.

Niinist√∂ did well on his first term, and sitting president is very difficult to beat on elections(2 terms is the maximum). It's thought that the second place candidate, Haavisto, was basically doing groundwork for his 2024 campaign with these elections, and other candidates more or less were there just because elections gave their parties a chance to bring out their preferred talking points. Beside Haavisto, I don't think anyone thought they could win(maybe with exception of V√§yrynen, who is... a curious character), and even for Haavisto, it seems like he was fairly content just losing this time and doing a more serious campaign 6 years from now.

Don't be fooled into believing Kurds in Western Turkey are assimilated more easily. They are, in fact, more closely knitted and more patriot Kurds because in the West of Turkey they become truly aware of their Kurdishness (due to discrimination). Ironically, because of that discrimination, Kurds in Istanbul and Izmir are better off than Turks because their network is more closely knitted and they tend to help out each other.

I can give you a thousands more examples. There is no peace without the PKK. Turkey has tried for 40 years to destroy the PKK and (thus destroy the will of the Kurds), but they have failed. The more Turks use force, the more violent Kurds will become. Turkey is not benefitting from any of this. All dictators and tyrants who cheered war, ended being destroyed by it. If Turks had any sense, they would speak out against their government. The PKK and Kurds are not in a position of power to initiate talks; only the Turkish state is. If Turkey chooses war instead, then Kurds will give you war.

PS: Why are you Turks always ignoring the fact that the Turkish oppression of Kurds existed long before the PKK even existed? The PKK is a response to Turkey's brutality against Kurds.

Cheap Southern agricultural products produced by slave labor (i.e. cotton and tobacco, and even sugarcane from slave plantations in the Caribbean) flowed into New York and from there to the rest of the world, while New York merchants sent high quality manufactured goods from the Northern Colonies/States and Europe to the South. The ties between New York City and the South and later the Confederacy were very strong. New York City was the most prominent center of Pro-Confederate sympathy in the North during the civil war, to the point where the infamous New York draft riots were essentially a Pro-Confederate uprising against the Union (there were lots of other factors involved in the draft riots of course but in many ways it did play out as such). A number of prominent New York families such as the Roosevelts had direct family ties to and large business interests in the slave-owning South. Although New York did not directly exploit slave labor much past it's relatively early colonial past (and never to the extent the Southern U.S. did), a great share of the wealth that built New York did at least tangentially/indirectly originate from the use of slavery.",,/r/europe/comments/7tejn7/dubai_1991_and_now_vs_balkans_1991_and_now/dtdl5po/,Taintstain,1517169490

621,"&gt; The study that I've linked actually acknowledges and takes into account the similar genes between South Asians and Europeans themselves

Doesn't matter. Not an argument. And not related to the topic. Pakistan can't be ""South Asian"". We should use pure Dravidians to calculate south asian dna. Not Iranian admixed East Eurasian admixed Pakistanis (yes it exists in them though depends on the person). This is like using Uzbeks to calculate East Eurasian admixture lmao

&gt;Hence Anatolians had Central Asians genes long before Turkic invasions

LOL. Please stop talking. You're embarassing yourself. The biggest indicator of Central Asian heritage is mongoloid dna. How much mongoloid heritage do Anatolian Greeks and Armenians have? As far as i know, around 0.5%. Turks are 10-15%. Do you want me to post personal results of Anatolian Turks and Greeks? :DDDDD

&gt;So in context of all these migrations, comparing the genes between the Turks, Europeans, Central Asians and so on makes sense

Comparing Turks to Turkmens, Anatolian Greeks would make a lot of sense rather than comparing Turks to the French and Kyrgyz samples. Did you even read the source that you sent? Of course you didn't lol.

&gt;But anyway, it's not like you will accept any of this

Don't act like you know anything about genetics my love.

&gt;so I am not going to waste my time

PLEASE WASTE YOUR TIME FOR ME PLEASE :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Go back to playing paradox games and reading wikipedia kid. 

&gt;You can believe that you have a direct ancestry all the way to Turkics from Altai mountains for all I care

Read what i wrote above. I already accepted that Turks Turkified  locals just as how they Turkified local Central Asians (Iranians). However we can't talk about pure Byzantine Anatolians in Turkey anymore, why? Because they mixed with the Turkics aka Oghuz Turks. Don't try to act smart. You know nothing.


&gt;just be sure not to look at the mirror too often.

Epic argument :DDD. Don't get into genetic arguments with people if you don't know anything about genetics. Or else you'll resort to ""look in le mirror xDD"" arguments. Besides you don't even know what i actually look like. And you didn't even say where you're actually from.

650,"&gt; Twice as much in the case of women and around half as much for men is slightly? We obviously have a different definition for that word. They act as a group. I treat them as one.

16%. 16% of Muslim women are unemployed. 84% of them ARE employed. The overall rate is 12.8% unemployment. That's 87% employment. That means an OVERWHELMING majority of them are working.

The unemployment rate in SPAIN is worse than Muslims in the UK, so do you judge Spanish people more harshly than Muslims?

&gt;But you‚Äôre telling me it affects 30% of Muslim women and not other typically non Muslim ethnic groups?

Yes. It's a case of self-fulfilling prophecy. People believe Muslims are more likely to be unemployed, therefore, they harbour some hatred for them, then employers begin to discriminate against them, so they find it harder to get jobs. This hatred has been festering in this country for years. Want to know the real, genuine solution? Stop harbouring racism. Then they won't feel like they're being discriminated against.

&gt;But you‚Äôre telling me it affects 30% of Muslim women and not other typically non Muslim ethnic groups?

It does affect other groups, which you can measure. The reason it doesn't affect other groups as much is because we got used to them and stopped being so racist, so the situation improved over time, like it already is now.

&gt;And I‚Äôm saying the trend says it isn‚Äôt as overall unemployment fall. As the link indicated.

And I'm saying Muslim unemployment has decreased FASTER than regular unemployment, as YOUR link indicates.

UK unemployment 2011-15 - 8%-5.4%

Muslim unemployment rate 2011-15 - 17.2%-12.8%

Overall decrease: 2.6%

Overall Muslim decrease 4.4%

&gt;But understandably women do tend to either have to or choose to stay at home. 

THIS IS WHAT I DON'T GET. You're SO understanding of the difference in our native population, but when it comes to Muslims you are entirely unforgiving.

&gt;I disagree. Nobody‚Äôs free to move to a place we ‚Äòown‚Äô.

Yes but you don't own the entire land. You own your land. SO, you can legally keep Muslims away from your property, but nothing else. There is no claim to country-sized land by an individual, the land is owned by people, so when the people are at peace there is no need to have borders.

&gt; Surely the argument is for smaller states if anything.

The argument is a persons limits shouldn't end at the border. Imagine if you lived in a situation where you literally could not leave your country. Would you be okay with that? Because that's the extreme side of your view. The extreme side of my view on the other hand, is total freedom.

&gt;Means a pretty weak rule of law. 

Not even remotely. The law would not change, the police would not change, only the borders.

&gt; You‚Äôre merely advocating for a world order.

I'm advocating for world freedom. Rights for every human. Nothing else would change. Countries can stay, just an overarching body (like the UN) with the legal power to enforce rights and freedom over all countries.

&gt;Well actually there is.

No, there is no objective measure of ""britishness"". Is a man who was born in britain his entire life, but rescinded citizenship to live in Germany when he turned 70, still British? How about a German, born in Germany to German parents, but lived in Britain his entire life since he was 2, is he British? Is he more or less British than the man without citizenship? How a bout a 3rd generation British immigrant to Sweden, compared with a 3rd generation Swedish immigrant to Britain? The Brit in Sweden still has more British blood in his veins, but the Swede in Britain has lived in Britain, which is more British?

The answer is there is no answer, because you cannot say with any OBJECTIVE measure, than someone is ""British"". Citizenship is subjective, blood is subjective, cultural-upbringing is subjective. That's my point.

&gt;No there isn‚Äôt. Wealthy countries can‚Äôt even look up the elderly.

Because all the money is in the hands of the rich. There is MORE than enough money to look after everyone, we as a nation just refuse to redistribute it from the people who have it to the people who need it. THAT is the only reason the elderly suffer in this country. Nothing else. It's because millionaires pay lower tax rates than the middle-class because they hide their money overseas.

&gt; Never mind look after more useless people.

They are not useless. 12.8% of them are unemployed, that is it.

&gt;How does that percentage look after the rest.

Through redistributing wealth.

&gt; Money isn‚Äôt the problem. It‚Äôs the lack of manpower

The irony of ignoring the manpower we could potentially get from these poorer countries... 

&gt;I‚Äôd feel perfectly fine keeping some white people out.

Which white people?

&gt;I suppose if you say something enough it must be true.

If something is measurably true, it's true. For example, unemployment rates for Muslims falling, the world becoming more peaceful, the rich gaining larger chunks of money from the people.

&gt;I judge swathes of people based on their ideology. 

Are the British people one single ideology to you? Surely you've lived here long enough to see the divide between North and South? Welsh and English? Tory and Labour? Of course we are not one ideology, so why the hell do you judge the 10+ muslim countries as one ideology, whilst judging Brits as individuals?

&gt; You‚Äôve met western Muslims. Much of which aren‚Äôt like most Muslims round the world and shouldn‚Äôt really classify as such. 

NO, THEY ARE STILL MUSLIMS. Okay let's go about this another way. In what way do you believe Islam is a bad religion, what particular way? The Quran having a few shit verses? The bible literally lays down laws for regulating slavery at one point, doesn't mean the religion necessarily follows. Religions can change, but they change by the people changing. 

Look at it this way, historically christians were a violent bunch of cunts, starting literally Europe-wide wars over their religion, that's pretty violent right? But they became more peaceful. HOWEVER, we don't stop calling them ""christian"" because they became more peaceful, do we? Ergo, someone can be christian and peaceful, just as somebody can be Muslim and peaceful. Do you agree?

&gt;Being ‚Äòpeaceful‚Äô isn‚Äôt the only thing I look for tbh.

I know, I was just using it as a catch-all term for opposing some of the shitty things that happen in the region.

&gt;So would you treat a Nazi as an individual?

I would try and convince him he is wrong rather than immediately trying to get rid of him. If he actively committed terrorist acts or planned on it I would have no issue with him being killed. Here's a better question, do you consider a German citizen being drafted into the military by force a ""nazi""? Because most Muslims were simply born into that culture, just as some ""Nazis"" were. Just as Christians are. But people change. Atheism is a rising ""non-religion"", and many Muslims are converting to either christianity or atheism, simply because of the lack of stable religious foundation in our country. THAT is an example of the power of OUR culture, to change their culture. Because their culture is shifting towards ours FAR more than ours is shifting towards theirs, wouldn't you agree? So it is a net benefit to have them exposed to our culture in this way.

&gt;I don‚Äôt see why I should support a group of people who show a lack of respect to women and believe in a sky fairy.

Well the sky fairy is pretty prominent in this country anyway unfortunate. In addition, it isn't about showing support for their culture, it's about exposing them to OUR culture. I'm not agreeing with their particular culture by having them over here, I'm just giving them the benefit of the doubt that they will become more peaceful/nicer if they are exposed to our culture, rather than if they were left in their own countries.

&gt;London is a desolate place

It's clearly not since it's literally still one of the worlds most powerful cities. Perhaps flooding particular cities with them was a bad way of going about it though, so I would advocate a program that helps spread them around major cities nearby.

&gt;I don‚Äôt feel cool about it.

Fair enough, but the best way of going about it in my view are programs that help integrate them into our society. Kicking them out just creates resentment and hatred, which is what we are trying to avoid. So perhaps programs that teach English directly to them in school or even adult education in libraries or classrooms.

When the Swedish retailer ICA suspected that an EU-law might be interpreted in such a way that they would be allowed to sell alcohol (we have a state run monopoly in sweden), they decided to test it in court. They started selling alcohol, and a court case took place. They lost but their behaviour is pretty standard. If you want an activity to be punished or allowed, try to see if the laws can be applied in such a way - test this by going to court. Why the swedish state won't try and prosecute the returnees using the same logic, is very strange. 

A lot of people will get off scott free by claiming that they travelled to help family members or fight against IS, you are right about that issue as well.

3. Stating that Poland was independent just because the government was Polish really does sound like a joke. There's no reason to explain this very deeply because that means that you just said that if a country's government doesn't mostly consist of the ethnic group/nationality that is the largest one in that country, that country stops being independent.

913,"&gt; Slav comes from the word slava - fame, glory. Slave in Bulgarian and Serbian, Macedonian is —Ä–æ–± (rob), in Croatian - rob, in Russian, Ukrainian, Belarussian - —Ä–∞–± (rab). So there is no connection between the words beside the one, you try to imply.

Ehh, in a way. The word ""Slav"" as in the ethnic word is indeed related to ""Slava"" meaning fame but only insofar that ""slava"" traces back to a word that meant ""loud"" in Proto-slavic whereas the meaning of the word ""Slav"" is commonly meant to descend from what basically means ""understandable"" denoting those people could understand when they spoke versus those they couldn't.

The English word ""Slave"" absolutely descends from what the Slavs just called themselves which were used as slaves during the times of the Holy Roman Empire.

&gt; By the same logic the Scottish are vermins because in Bulgarian the word —Å–∫–æ—Ç (Scot) means exactly this.

&gt;Als PMK-Rechts werden Straftaten kategorisiert,
¬ªwenn in W√ºrdigung der Umst√§nde der Tat und/oder
der Einstellung des T√§ters Anhaltspunkte daf√ºr vorliegen,
dass sie nach verst√§ndiger Betrachtung (z. B. nach
Art der Themenfelder) einer ‚Ä∫rechten‚Äπ Orientierung
zuzurechnen sind, ohne dass die Tat bereits die Au√üerkraftsetzung
oder Abschaffung eines Elements der
freiheitlichen demokratischen Grundordnung zum
Ziel haben muss. Insbesondere sind Taten dazuzurechnen,
wenn Bez√ºge zu v√∂lkischem Nationalismus, Rassismus,
Sozialdarwinismus oder Nationalsozialismus
ganz oder teilweise urs√§chlich f√ºr die Tatbegehung
waren¬´.

It seems that if it's racist motivated outside of the other motivations,it's categorized as PMK-rechts. For PMK-links :

I find quite surprising the productivity figures of Denmark and UK (GBR)  for 1-9 enterprises. Spain 1-9 enterprises are hairdressers, bars, delivery subcontractors, small shops...  Three groups:

* Independent contractors.
* Fake independent contractors, that work full time for a company.
* Small companies that pay very low salaries and barely make any profits.

How are small enterprises in those countries?

Some people (Polish, Jews and other) were supporting German to eat more. They have options:

- die because they didn't eat enough

- help Germans

It was really hard decision. Especially when You have children.

1035,"""Alt-right"", ""identitarians"", ""ethno-nationalists"" and ""New Right"" are all different terms for extremely similar ideas and movements in the end.

*The* [NPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Party_of_Germany) referred to itself as ""young right"" when they were formed in 1964 to distance themselves from the ""old right"" aka the Nazi regime while trying to spread similar ideas. That's why all of the groups above are referred to as *Neue Rechte* (""[new right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neue_Rechte)"") in Germany for example.

The guy who coined the term ""alt-right"", [Richard Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_B._Spencer) (the ""Hail Trump!""-guy), considers himself part of [the Identitarian movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identitarian_movement). That in return is deeply intertwined with parties like the AfD in Germany, the FN in Germany as well as more extreme groups.

After checking the corresponding /r/Israel thread [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/7tewgx/can_someone_explain_me_the_hype_around_the_polish/) where [this](https://twitter.com/PatrykJaki/status/957356771164807169) translation of the law is mentioned as most accurate the issue seems to have nothing to do with the first part of the law but more with how broad it is in general. It sounds like it covers *all kinds of crimes* of the Polish state or nation ""against the facts"".

Is there an exception for an academical and educational context somewhere else? How is ""Polish nation"" defined considering both that and the ""Polish state"" are mentioned separately?

The way it sounds to me (which could be off) is that we need to understand the law like this: ""Saying that the Polish nation or state was ever even co-complicit (against the facts) in any crime against peace and humanity or war crimes or grossly diminishes the responsibility of the actual perpetrators thereof is now punishable.""

The Nazi related part specifically is only the very first condition in that translation.

That controversy was sparked because the German phrase **is** factually and linguistically unambiguous in German, was translated to English and misunderstood there.

If I talk about American military bases across the world today and then mention Japanese bases, German bases etc. the ""American military bases in Japan""-part is implied.

Analogue if I talk about Nazi camps across Europe and then mention ""Polish camps"", ""German camps"" and ""French camps"" the ""Nazi-run camps""-part is implied. That's true in both English and German.

Especially in a German context there was no single point in my own education or that of anyone I know that made me even consider the phrase *could* imply a non-Nazi German responsibility.

Can you cite a single kind of official German person of public interest (politicians, journalists, etc.) that made references like we've seen from Israelis in the last couple days that imply that Poles were *responsible* for the Holocaust?

Even our right-wing nutcases are more likely to claim those areas should be rightfully German than to say that Poles are responsible instead of Germans.

Billions of acres redistributed by local governments to the first European settlers to move over. That's arable, minable, build able land. That's trillions of dollars of capital.

Dubai is, in fact, booming. Booming , as you say, on the back of imported labour and oil but life tends not to care much about the morality of the method, as it does about the practical result. Immoral wealth, is in the end, still wealth. If that continues depends on how well they leverage their present, and is yet to be seen.

&gt;Balkan soceities on the other hand have been around for centuries, through countless wars, and will continue to be. 

So have and will tribes in the Amazon and Saharah. Just being in a location is a low bar to pass, and the future isn't made by just being. The balkans in general is, much like the rest of the world, a reactive group to the more active and ambitious societies of the world.  We've all relegated ourselves as pretty ""cultural"" backdrops for events.

1400,"They were German death camps build on Polish land, people typically referred to them as Polish death camps which Polish people understandably don't like because the phrase makes it seem their construction and operation was a Polish undertaking rather than German.

Israels stance seems to be that Polish people were involved (although all statements also mention a lot of Polish people were put into these camps and a lot of Polish people harbored and protected Jewish people during German occupation) and that this is an attempt to ""clean up"" history and could hamper further historical work into Poland's role in the holocaust. 

Poland argues the statement is inherently dishonest and so widespread that these measures are justified and fundamentally should come under similar types of legislation that other continental European nations have regarding use of certain phrases, actions or objects associated with the Nazis or the victims of the Holocaust.

Personally I'm on the fence, I don't like the idea of outlawing any phrase but at the same time do sympathize that the term is extremely misleading if heard by someone who may not know much about ww2 or Polish history. I don't really agree with Israels stand point, as far as i can see Poland isn't suggesting that the camps built in Poland can no longer be discussed or referenced, simply that you can't call them Polish death camps, you could for instance call them the camps set up by Germany in occupied Poland or Nazi death camps set up in Poland without any issue.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/7tf676/israel_urges_poland_to_change_bill_regarding_its/dtcgu83/,kelkos,1517103667

1423,"Also historical reasons. In western and southern Germany, inheritances tended to get split among sons. This led to a lot of small-ish states. In contrast in northern Germany primogeniture was favoured, which meant the princely states there could generally preserve their territories across generations.

And through all of history, states tend to put their resources to were they are most useful. Meaning the capital and perhaps a large few cities. Just look at France that has been a single thing since about the times Caesar campaigned (some minor hickups like Frankish inheritance and the HYW not counting). You have Paris (capital, largest city), you have Lyon (most important episcopal seat in France), and you have a couple of ports to troll the British and support your colonial empire. The rest of your state is *not important*, and thus gets scraps at best.

So people in the more stable states in the north slowly migrated into the cities over centuries (and then not-so-slowly once Industrialisation happened), whereas in the south the borders ere constantly redrawn and all the minor barons and dukes there put their funds in their capitals. Plus in the south you had a lot more of important Free and Imperial Cities.

And that's because southern and western Germany was already much more developed than the north because Romans.","Ich bin ein Preu√üe, kennt ihr meine Farben?",/r/europe/comments/7tcv83/population_density_in_europe/dtch3w7/,KlingonAdmiral,1517104013

You read spanish newspapers, catalan ones, follow the news on tv3 and la sexta, you read the interviews on elcritic.cat to see what the different factions on each side think and the strategies they develop? You maybe hear the catalan radio programs which cover all these issues daily (radio is still pretty important in Catalonia) and then you maybe watch some youtube videos at night on several political commentary programs from spanish radios (LibertadDigital, Carlos Herrera, etc,etc)? Maybe you actually follow what is happenning and have the multiple arguments more or less controlled.

When the price dropped below $30 in 2016, it therefore hurt Venezuela a lot more than the Saudis.

Not saying Venezuela isn't corrupt and mismanaged as fuck. ;-) They are. They just also got screwed by the Saudis' insistence on keeping production levels high to try and compete with US shale.",,/r/europe/comments/7tejn7/dubai_1991_and_now_vs_balkans_1991_and_now/dtcb86m/,CHPedersen,1517096620

Until very recently, Germany was among the western european country one of the closest to Washington. 

Documents leaked by Snowden actually show Germany took the confidentail data from Airbus and Eurocopters, they hacked french diplomatic networks and they spied on the European Union in Brussels... and they gave everything to the americans. Everything.  This is insane.

Merkel played a key role in pushing for sanctions on Russia despite strong opposition from France and Italy. 

Sanctions had major economic consequences and shifted the global gas market. At the time, after the fall of President Ianoukovitch, the Oligarch Billionaire Petro Porotchenko got elected President and the son of Joe Biden was parachuted on the board of one of the biggest gas companies in the country. Friends of the family of Secretary State John Kerry got involed in the situation through extreme lobbying in Washington. At the time, the name of the owners of the company changed hands but it was classified information. Nobody knows what actually happened. Some former owners and boards members are accused and risk prosecution. The Oligarch Petro Porotchenko, backed by the americans, has claimed that he can not interfere directly in the justice system but there was heavy opposition from the justice system in the gas  sector.  Many prosecutors refused to cooperate on some issues including attacks against former gas board members.

This is high level international geopolitics.

Because the measures we did to prevent the nsdap are ad hoc.

Repression did not help it made things much worse. Our line is a prime example of stupid policy with unintended negative consequences.

They use single instances because their voter base does not understand statistics. But the statistics are heavily on their side - MENA migrants are massively more criminal per capita.

As the article states Israel is concerned because this law can be used to deny the historical truth (such a funny combination of words) that some Poles participated in the Holocaust. My Opinion is that this law is made by the polish goverment for political gain and nothing more. And i wont discuss Israels concerns with the law further, as i have neither enough ionformation nor am i intrested in in it.

1605,"&gt;Extreme right wing as defined by Austrian law. This is a clear definition in contrast to ""the austrian center"" or the even more mystical ""global center"".

But a very bad one, as it does not take the reality of human variation into account. If someone wants to capture a real political phenomenon, one has to quantify it, not jus tmake an arbitrary position.

&gt;Calling a group of people parasites with a phrasing that indicates that this is an essential aspect of them. Do you not think that this is problematic?

i think it is not okay. But it is not right wing. Left wingers have called the upper class parasites from the very inception, for example. Rhetoric like this can also come from the political center. It is simply not a good way to argue on its own.

&gt; Furthermore it is a book the party leaders endorsed with forewords. 

So? Do you think Strache read it? Strache does not strike me much of a reader...

&gt;You may argue that Strache and Hofer endorsed the book only through accident, providing forewords for a party colleague without actually reading the book or knowing it's content. 

They may, they may not. Maybe they missed the sentence, hell I dont remember every single line I ever read. maybe the skipped the site. Maybe they read it, thought that it was worded a bit too strong but that the gist of the book is excellent so they chose not to dwell on it. THousand *more reasonable* explanations than them being secret genocidal expnasionists just waiting to carve out some Lebensraum.

&gt;Even then their deed is deeply problematic, since they still officially endorsed the Book and it#s standpoints. 

No it is not.

&gt;Did I say that the FP√ñ is anything at all like the Nazis when it comes to consequences of their election? 

A lot of people said things like that to me in the past. If people say far right, they usually conflate it with the nazis.

&gt;Landbauer was the vice chairman of said organization. If it is improbable that he knew of the book when he was eleven years old, then it is improbable that he did not know of the songbook as the organization's vice chairman.

They didn't necessarily have to think that Zeman is a much worse candidate, they might have been undecided but have chosen Zeman in the end because of that crazy hectic media campaign in the last two weeks.

It's similar to what happened in the US presidential election where many people voted for Trump instead of Clinton, only because Democrats have (very shadily) chosen Clinton instead of Sanders. (I don't think it decided the election there though.)

I have personally heard about several people who decided to vote for Zeman mainly to ""send a message to media"". And yeah, those were generally people who deemed both candidates as bad choices, so it's not like that strongly pro-Draho≈° people would change their mind because of media.

1662,"You know, medium density is a thing too.

Taking a quick look at Google Maps, Toronto has urban sprawl that very few European cities rival. Sure, your city cores might be denser, but your suburbs sprawl ridiculously.

A European suburb is usually quite dense, centered on a train station. A North American suburb is usually spread out and sprawling, taking up a ton of area to house few people - and that is just as true for Canada as for the US.

Your typical USA/Canadian city has a small area of super-high density, surrounded by vast stretches of low-density sprawl. European cities are typically a large downtown area of high to medium density, and concentrated low-mid density suburbs radiating outwards.

The European method makes public transit far more efficient, makes highways less important, and means that overall population density in built-up areas is higher - all in all, it is far more efficient than what you have going on. You can't even have decent commuter traffic because your suburbs are so spread-out. Sure, you might have a single-track commuter railway with departures every 30 minutes, but in a big European city, that would be double track and a departure every 10 minutes, and more frequently in the rush hour. Your O-Train is nothing to brag about, you don't have a single metro system with more than four lines, and your cities are so sprawling that huge highway networks are needed to keep them running, which just eats even more of you natural areas.

___

That became a bit of a rant, but I care very strongly about making cities properly walkable and with proper public transit, and that's one thing that does not exist in North America. New York is the exception, but even that city has been paved over with asphalt, resulting in massive suburban sprawl. You need to densify your suburbs; they're a much, MUCH bigger problem than the areas that are already medium or high density.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/7tejn7/dubai_1991_and_now_vs_balkans_1991_and_now/dtc5rm9/,wasmic,1517089946

I havent computed anything. But studies have been done that show that there is an average IQ difference between different populations all over the world, you are the one focusing on just black and white people, as if they are both monolithic groups for some reason. I haven't talked about any such thing. Everywhere in the world, there are average IQ differences, within europe, within africa, within asia, and in between all of them as well. What those differences are caused by or how important they are is a different debate altogether, and I never mentioned racial IQ differences at all until you did. I merely talked about the heritability of intelligence in general, in the entire human species.

&gt;you cant properly establish the causal directions here is it that high IQ causes you to have kids later in life or is it that having kids later in life gives your kids higher IQ or both? etc.

I have no idea what this has to do with anything or the original conversation, which is that intelligence is strongly heritable. Are you trying to claim that having less kids somehow can contribute to intelligence just because the two are correlated? That is, white people have less kids on average and white kids are on average more intelligent, therefore having less kids causes them to be more intelligent? Well that's on you to prove or substantiate. Seems like a very stupid thing to claim, and no studies have shown this to at all be true, probably because it's not even a sensible hypothesis.

&gt;this is the central issue to most claims about race or racial discrimination it's almost impossible to prove anything.

Paul Van de Ven et al., ""A Comparative Demographic and Sexual Profile of Older Homosexually Active Men,"" Journal of Sex Research 34

Among married females 85% reported sexual fidelity. Among married men, 75.5% reported sexual fidelity. Among homosexual males in their current relationship, 4.5% reported sexual fidelity.

1916,"*Trakai Island Castle was built in several phases. During the first phase, in the second half of the 14th century, the castle was constructed on the largest of three lake islands by the order of Grand Duke Kƒôstutis. The construction of Trakai Island Castle was related to the expansion and strengthening of the Trakai Peninsula Castle. Kƒôstutis moved his main residence and his treasury to the Island Castle.*

*The castle suffered major devastation during an attack by the Teutonic Knights in 1377. After the assassination of Kƒôstutis, a power struggle between Jogaila and Vytautas the Great for the title of Grand Duke of Lithuania began. The castle was besieged by both sides. Soon after the reconciliation between Jogaila and Vytautas, the second phase of construction started and continued until 1409. This phase is regarded as the major development in the history of the castle. Apparently, during the truce with the Teutonic Order, the construction works were supervised by the Order's stonemason Radike, four years before the Battle of Grunwald.*",Lithuania,/r/europe/comments/7t5gcq/lithuania_dope_af_from_rlithuania/dtbmzum/,LittleTwinky,1517067756

Basically they want the state to more directly take care of them (in this way they are similar to European social democrats, but they also greatly value personal liberty). 

European liberals, on the other hand, want more freedom in general. They want the state to have less influence on their lives. Some of them even want to e.g. remove any state regulations of the market (you could call them libertarians; *Svobodn√≠* are similar to this group).

Heterosexuality is more normal than homosexuality.

According to me and evidently most of the people in the EU. And are you seriously trying to justify homophobia because 'thats how it's always been'? Dude, seriously? Most of the world was also against giving women equal rights or letting them vote, does that mean that it's acceptable to deny women those rights? Then what do you think of the Romans, or Greeks? Homosexuality was pretty common back then. Were they wrong? Was that the result of brainwashing too? Or simply people not caring what two consenting adults got up to?

2078,"Firstly, why would you assume that the people who are not fine with homosexuality are fine with Carnaval in Rio?. There are quite many voices who say that that carnival is immoral because it's overly sexual and sodomist. So it's basically the same as with pride parades, but at least it's far enough for people not to be bothered that much. Secondly, there is a correlation between lower level of education and homophoby. While not applicable in 100%, it's there. And in these cases, yes, people trust the media of their choice (right-leaning) instead of trying to think and differentiate anything. Media says, there's a naked dude running with a dildo on his forehead on a parade showing 'equality' of gay and straight, and that's not what straight people do, hence all gays are inappropriate. Is it dumb? Yes. But what would you expect of far-right, ultra-catholic nationalists? They don't want to like anything that is not traditional, and well, this gives them the argument to use against the entire movement. And this is where my point was - if no people participated in the parade dressed/behaving inappropriately, and no inappropriate behavior was to be seen on the streets (why should something considered inappropriate for straight couples be okay for others anyway?), only then will the haters have to stop. They'll run out of reasons to hate. Also, keep in mind, I'm only speaking of the parade in Warsaw, as that's the only one I've seen. Sure, they may be others, more down-to-earth ones, but it's not these countries that have problems with homosexuality - it's countries like Poland. Make no mistake, that parade (or, rather, Equality March) is an incredible event, with everyone actually smiling (rare thing in Warsaw), and with thousands of people voicing their support - but it's ruined by that 1% (or not even) who just can't contain themselves.",,/r/europe/comments/7tbq8f/social_attitudes_towards_homosexuality_across_the/dtbipe6/,Keramzyt,1517061287

1) white people in the West have never been oppressed because of the colour of their skin. White people are much less likely to face discrimination because of the colour of their skin. That's not to say that it can't and doesn't happen, but it's much less likely. Being white is the norm and always has been. Black people and gay people felt the need for those things because they were historically oppressed, and even today face discrimination and abuse. The law is on their side but when you hear stories of people getting the shit kicked out of them because they look or sound gay then you remember that society, even in the West, has a way to go before everything is completely fine.

2) usually, the only people you see bleating on about white pride are the 'white power' first-in-the-air neo-Nazi skinhead types. I don't think white pride in itself should be a bad thing at all, if people feel proud to be white then more power to them, but it's pretty obvious that not enough white people are bothered to start such a thing, except for the far-right loonies who see being white as being better.

In the context you describe, it seems acceptable and logical that he gets charged and convicted of *harassment* for calling the other guy an asshole, when everything else is also taken into account. What I still find problematic, though, is that the ""asshole"" quip was not used to convict him just for *harassment*, but also for *insulting* someone. This confirms to me that the law does allow someone to be punished for a benign insult (from another comment chain):

&gt;&gt;Whether something is an insult is judged by ""would the general populace consider this an insult?"" and not by the personal feelings of the guy/woman who sued or a small group of people.

&gt;Where is that principle set out, as I don't see it in the law? Also, wouldn't being called a ""shitty politician"" or an ""incompetent public official"" or something similar be considered an insult by the general public? For me, that certainly is an insult, but it is also a completely legitimate opinion and criticism of a public figure, which is why it should not be sanctioned. However, both according to the text of the law that I have read and the principle you mentioned, that could be a punishable offense. What is even more concerning is that, per the same law, you can be sanctioned for truthful, factual statements if their form is insulting.

&gt;Granted, someone did point out that the German Constitutional Court found this vague wording constitutional because a century of jurisprudence has established clearly what an insult is, but no one has explained to me in more detail what that would be (i.e. what in the laws and the jurisprudence is preventing a politician from successfully suing you for such statements, except for them being smart enough not to actually attempt it).",Republic of Srpska,/r/europe/comments/7t4cue/german_police_sue_american_woman_for_calling_them/dtbfh2o/,votapmen,1517054097

2192,"There's more to the interwar period than that.

In 1921 - League of Nations declares Galicia as ""laid outside the territory and merely occupied by Poland"".

In 1923 - recognized as Polish territory as long as ""it is recognised by Poland that  ethnographical conditions necessitate an  autonomous regime in the Eastern part of Galicia"" ([treaty text](http://www.forost.ungarisches-institut.de/pdf/19230315-1.pdf))

Polish government took that recognition as ""there's way too many Ukrainians there"" and started [polonization campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polonization#West_Ukraine) including but not limited to:

1. ""Fairly"" redistributing agrarian land in Volhynia (yes, that Volhynia). Main criterion for eligibility - being a veteran of polish army.

2. Forbidding use of Ukrainian in government

3. Severe quotas on admissions to university (no more than [15% Ukrainians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Lviv#Jan_Kazimierz_University_.281919.E2.80.9339.29))

4. Closing of Ukrainian schools. From 1922 to 1938 number dropped down, for Galicia from 2400 to 350, for Volhynia from 443 to 8.
 - Side note: it lead to increase of popularity of Ukrainian scout organization called ""Plast"". As a result it was banned in 1930.

5. [Taking over orthodox churches in Volhynia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovery_of_Orthodox_Churches_in_the_Second_Polish_Republic). Roughly 190 destroyed and about 150 forcefully converted to Roman Catholic.

2243,"&gt; On the one hand you say the EU is not to blame for the Iraq mess that was down to the UN and yet on the other hand you say the ECHR and EU council have blood on their hands for the refugee crisis.

Both can be true there's plenty of blame to go around just because the EU didn't cause the crisis doesn't mean they didn't mishandle it and make it worse.

&gt;The EU mishandled the Iraq crisis as the major powers within the EU could not act with one voice on stopping America from invading Iraq and focusing instead on the Arab-Israel conflict and combating global jihad. 

My point is that you cant stop the US or Russia for that matter without physical conflict or the threat of it, and nobody in Europe wants that, look at Ukraine and the European reaction to that has had little effect.

I'm sorry, what?!

&gt; ***The BKA maintains that using the virus allows them to more effectively investigate digital communication***, but security experts say that the tool could be used by criminals. In addition, anti-surveillance activists argue that its use is an invasion of personal security by the state ‚Äî a sensitive subject in Germany given the country's history of surveillance under both the Nazi regime and the state police in the German Democratic Republic during the communist era.

no shit

&gt; Stasi invasion of privacy?

&gt;Critics of using the Trojan virus on suspects devices argue that the BKA is able to investigate just fine with using the tool. The report pointed out that in dozens of past cases, investigators were able to add another mobile end device to a suspect's account in order to access sent messages. However, the article said this was possible only when communications were not completely secure.

&gt; In 2017 the BKA also requested millions of euros to improve its IT systems.

Wyoming has a higher homicide rate than every European country other than the Baltics. An unrelated fun fact is that, as of 2008, Wyoming had just two escalators in the entire state.

I agree but I don't see how anyone can or would blame the EU for this. Nor do how I see how the UNSC can persuade any of it's powerful members to not break UN law considering all members with maybe the exception of Germany  have gone against it's rulings multiple times, it's a rather toothless institution unless you piss everyone off.

&gt;The other areas you mention are about the ‚Ç¨ and the free travel area which all European members were in favour of. This is a classic case of the EU caused the Greek banking crisis and local elected leaders are not held accountable to their own citizens.

I agree in this instance that the EU isn't directly to blame for the crisis in these points you mentioned but the framework allows for people to frame and abuse the system to there own ends especially by stronger countries/Non-state actors/Turkey. But I think still the ECHR and EU council are directly to blame for there own failures in the refugee crisis. Many think the EU isn't held accountable by it's citizen either with usually much less particaption in elections than local ones.

&gt;Finally Europe is proposing banning weapons sales to Saudi Arabia this should have happened a while go. Saudi Arabia has appalling human rights records and Islamism has heavily promoted in the Kingdom. Overthrowing Arab gvt in the region. 

I agree SA is a terrible institution/GOV but still it is trying to become more liberal in a societal sense under it new leadership and would be a lot better for Europe than anything that would rise from the ashes you only have to at Syria, Libya and Iraq for proof of that. I also think that the EU limiting weapon sale wouldn't have much of a effect there's still plenty of countries that would happily sell them arms eg USA, UK ,China , Turkey, Russia, Canada, AUSNZ, India, Pakistan hell even the Israel might considering the now become best buds because of Iran.

I don't think that should be the goal. I wouldn't argue that the best solution is for people to format their former culture and reinstall a new one. 

I would argue that they should first respect the country that they are moving in and respecting the laws of that country. They should do a self-analysis and see if their values and culture could be a problem it that country. For example, if you think that gays should be killed and trying to move to a country with same sex marriage, you should rethink your views or, at minimum, keep those thoughts for yourself. Or if you're moving to a country where anti-Semitic is completely unacceptable and you hold some controversial views about Jews, you should also rethink your position before moving. 

But the land that is receiving you also shouldn't forget their own laws, such as freedom of speech, expression and freedom of religion.

&gt;Not exactly controversial as it‚Äôs based on culture and religion.

Arguably the fact that 27% of all non-muslim women aren't actively looking for work is a pretty shocking fact too, should we send the women back to the kitchen?

OR maybe we could accept the fact that cultural and societal norms shouldn't stand in the way of progress, and we should encourage everyone, whether woman or Muslim, to join us.

Seriously though, I don't see you getting angry at 27% of all women.

About YPG not being on the international terrorist list. What a organization should do to enter that list? Are there any civilian or soldier kill threshold? Or do they need to attack another countries as well?

It is in the list for Turkey. There are hard evidence YPG has strong ties with PKK, a terrorist organization IN the international terrorist list. If US can support terrorists and justify, there can't be such justification btw, itself as they are not in the list, why Turkey can't do the same presuming the claims about ISIS are true. 

&gt; if you don't like YPG is to not do anything.

Not doing anything about terrorists next to you is not a choice you see. US has no common borders in the first place but they claim more rights than the neighbors. That is the BS.

2789,"&gt; Did you even think before writing this? What's the subject of the article?

You did talk about Russians losing rights. The things I can think of is how their native language lost official status and how they, at one point, holded a citizenship of a collapsed country (all a result of Soviet Union collapsing). 

What concerns the current step in Latvia, it's about education and immigration policies, as I said. The education system is heritage of Soviet-era one and it has been reformed constantly. Again, Russians losing rights all the time?

&gt; No minority in Russia has a share of the population even close to that of the Russians in Latvia. So Latvia is indeed worse than Russia, considering its ending of Russian education schools.

And Russia is the successor state of the country that planted so many Russians there. Latvia has the right to implement its own education system and doesn't have to deal with whatever Soviet Union forced them. Meanwhile, we are talking about *native* minorities in Russia, y'know, whose lands Russians conquered.

&gt; Apparently not accepting your values and preferring Russian is a reason to reject their acceptance. And integration and assimilation are different matters.

If you read my comments again, I talked about specific type of people who refuse to integrate at all. I do not expect Russians to become Estonians/Latvians but I do expect them to at least develop an identity (which also includes values) different from Russia. If the latter doesn't happen, on what basis should you even accept them? If they are mentally the same as people in Russia, then obviously they are not part of Estonian or Latvian society now.

But thanks for posting that source, it confirms exactly what we know - that Greek was spoken exactly in the areas where it's attested by ethnographers in the 19th century. Of course he missed the areas of Macedonia and Epirus where it was spoken (interesting how he also missed Albanian but mentions Slavic, an anachronism of some sort)but it's pretty good . Also that in the author's estimate, modern Greek was closer to classical than Latin Italian was to Latin. Not bad!

Either way, I personally agree with you that Macedonians should be free to call their country whatever they want and that Greece is in the wrong there but it's a bit silly how far some of you guys go just because you're a recently separate entity from the Bulgarians and were thoroughly confused about your own identity at the time (Slav speakers from Macedonia could identify as pretty much anything back then).

&gt;We show that the genetic variation of the contemporary Turkish population clusters with South European populations, as expected, but also shows signatures of relatively recent contribution from ancestral East Asian populations

&gt;Among all sampled groups, the Adygei population (Circassians) from the Caucasus was closest to the Turkish samples among sampled European (French, Italian), Middle Eastern (Druze, Palestinian), and Central (Kyrgyz, Hazara, Uygur), South (Pakistani), and East Asian (Mongolian, Han) populations

Wow. Such mixture indeed. As i mentioned before Turks are a mix between Central Asians and West Asians. In that meme wikipedia meme there are also very outdated sources from early 2000s but i'm too lazy to fix all of them. Are Turks mixed? Yes. Are they as mixed as you imply? No. 



As I mentioned before. Turks are mostly a mix of West Asians and Central Asians. Closest to Northern Caucasians. I'll help you to understand by posting some pca plots

&gt; That's why I was asking, maybe in another comment chain, whether the ""German police"" is suing the American, as the article claims, or if it's the police officers in question.

Normally the insulted person has to sue. In case of these policemen if i remember correctly their superior can sue on their behalf. 

&gt; Because the opposite would jeopardize democracy, as anything you say will insult someone.

An insult in terms of the law is the **deliberate** defiance of another person's honor/dignity. 
Just because someone is insulted by what you said doesn't mean it was an Insult in terms of the law. 

&gt; If you call Merkel an asshole, maybe she can't sue you as chancellor, but she still can do it in a private capacity, which is preposterous and undemocratic.

Why? I'm definitely not a fan of her and she's been called worse in the last years without ever sueing anyone but it doesn't help the debate, does it?

&gt; I don't give a fuck if you call me an asshole, but if you say that I shouldn't have the freedom to call a politician an asshole, I'm gonna get insulted as hell. Finally, it's absurd that a grown person would find their dignity jeopardize by being called an asshole.

This whole debate made it look like a bigger deal than it actually is. Noone sues others for calling them an asshole or any other thing really, even nazi. Even though I think that one takes it one step further for many Germans.

They want to keep their culture from the ME without integrating themselves into the new culture they encounter.

That is wrong on so many levels. If I were to emigrate to another country I will accept their culture, and I won't expect the people there to accept mine. If you want to keep your god damn culture then stay in the country where you came from. 

Clashing multiple cultures against eachother only lead to division and hatred. 

Just have a quick search on recent rape rates in sweden and look for yourself. Ohh and the government doesn't track rape rates anymore.. I wonder why..... 

Currently european countries have a lottery system for who we let in. THIS SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE. Let people in who will not come here to recieve welfare support and take advantage of our economies. If people come to our countries they should be expected to work!

Anyways, it's far cheaper to help people in the country where they are from. 100,000¬£ might be enough to support 5-6 people in scandinavia for a year, but imagine how far it will go in the middle east. Maybe it can help 30-50 people a year there.

He sued the government because we didn't do enough to get him released. The government settled out of court and paid $10.5 million, instead of fighting it all the way like the opinion polls showed Canadians wanted.

It's important not to lie is it not? He was 15 when he was arrested there is a lot of dispute about what did or did not happen on the day he was arrested. But that's not even really relevant to his lawsuit against the government.

2941,"&gt;Say your an Iranian, El Salvadorian or Cuban the US would be strict towards you. Not the same standard if you came from White Christian Europe. 

This is bullshit, though. 

1. There are more Iranians living in the US than anywhere in the world outside Iran. (Relatively easy to claim asylum, lots of sponsorship by relatives, etc.)

2. People from El Salvador receive asylum in the US all the time (plausible gang violence). Hell, I've gotten two teenagers from El Salvador asylum myself.  ~100k people from El Salvador live in the US on a special just-for-El Salvador (&amp; Haiti &amp; Dominican Republic) ""lol your country is a disaster"" visa. 

3. Cuba is the worst possible fucking example of ""restrictive"" policy. Until 2016, any Cuban was *automatically* granted asylum upon arriving in the United States &amp; accelerated permanent legal residency and citizenship. (My animus is generated by the fact that Cuban Americans are often extraordinarily unsympathetic to illegal immigrants from elsewhere.)

&gt;Their rules are very discriminatory towards Arabs and people from the global south. 

Not only are the rules ""not very discriminatory"" based on nationality, there's a visa lottery for countries that the US gets few immigrants from. No criteria. Just toss your hat in. Though this may end soon as part of a deal to grant amnesty for around  2 million illegal immigrants.

(The exception, of course, being Trump's 90-day travel ban. Which is awful, but an exception to general US practices, and likely in violation of a US law prohibiting discrimination based on nationality in the immigration system.)

Is it easier to immigrate to the US from ""White Christian Europe"" than other places? Nope.  People from Europe may be more likely to have skills/money to get over on H1Bs, student visas, etc., but that reflects opportunities of money, not discrimination against ""the global south.""

All that said, is it relatively difficult to legally immigrate to the US? Yes - as with all wealthy countries. I think it should be easier. But it's by no means as you present it. ",,/r/europe/comments/7t4kvl/homicide_rates_the_us_versus_the_eu_xpost_from/dtacpm2/,deaduntil,1516996103

The fact that you can't just go around and insult people is a very minor cut to your right of free speech especially since critizising others for their actions and behaviour (aka shit character) is absolutely legal. Noone's gonna fine you for saying that you dislike what they said/did.

Calling actual nazis nazis is legal. This law isn't as strict as it may seem. 

Story time: During the first Gulf war a student got fined for having a bumper sticker  that said ""Soldiers are murderers"" on his car. He went through all the regular courts and they all confirmed the sentence to be slender. So he went to the Federal Constitutional Court and filed a complaint. The court decided to lift his sentence. It came to the conclusion that eventhough the phrase was insulting, it should be allowed because it was used as a combat term and strong language was to be allowed (to some etxtend) to make oneself heard in (what was back then) a heated public debate. It was used to make a legitimate point. 

In the case of this lovely lady, calling police men 'nazis' didn't do that. They didn't drag off jews to put them into concentration camps. They asked her to remove some fluid from her hand luggage and offered her to put it into her main luggage or throw it away .

The Germans consistently act as if they wouldn't even defend Germany itself, much less Poland or the Baltic states.

&gt; The Serbs claimed they made simple modifications to their old Soviet radars, allowing them to easily spot the F-117s.

The story about modifying radars is definitely untrue.

&gt; But more importantly (and accurately) the F-117 was shot down because of lazy mission planning by the US.


How Bill Sweetman puts it, there was a computer that plotted the flight path for pilots. They nicknamed it [""Elvira, Mistress of the Dark""](https://books.google.rs/books?id=Q_wyJ_pKcqoC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=elvira+stealth+bomber&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gTEKB_UPQ0&amp;sig=-lp-LBVwR59WGxtDTlgs5pfxUnc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT3dfy3fXYAhXM_aQKHVQKAg0Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=elvira%20stealth%20bomber&amp;f=false) (Google won't allow me to quote the entire page 32). Elvira used data from AWACS and all other allied planes in the theater to plan a flight path, so the airplane would be exposed to as little radar illumination as possible. By turning radar on and off, you can trick Elvira and ""lure"" the aircraft into a zone where you can try to shoot him. 

This automated mission planning system is mentioned in some [other sources](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/f-117.htm) too (second chapter, last sentence).

Again, if other nations, German officers and international news outlets are talking about a lack of funding, then the probability that Von der Leyen just wants more influence, is quite low. 

&gt;Before the Bundeswehr could get any more funding, they would first need to prove that they are using their current funds effectively.

They prove that every day by helping out in crisis regions. You only hear about the outcries, but not about the things that work. A lot of those outcries are actually the result of a lack of funding and not because of incompetence: helicopters, fighter jets and submarines not being available; not enough weapons or ammunation for training. People just say it's incompetence, because it's much more convenient than simply admitting that they don't have enough money. In the end Germans simply don't identify with the military as much as the French, Brits of Americans do.

It's the same with France. They technically don't have to be deployed in countries that don't belong to their territories.

3304,"That is where the ubiquitous scheduling software comes in. We have the technology in our pockets that tracks our every move and already calculates across timezone differences; in further increasing use.

Furthermore, look at how we decide how to do that now: we take their timezone and add ours to the equation: If I'm in Panama at GMT -5, and I want to know what time it is at Berlin, GMT+1, I know it's 7 hours ahead. If New Dehli, GMT-5 + GMT 5.5; roughly 11 and a half hours ahead.

The hours will still roughly exist in my system, and travel between those hours will still be lumped just as so. There's just the addition of minutes and seconds so it's more GMT -5.12.30 (roughly Manhattan?), say, added onto GMT +07.45.45 (Saigon?) to get a sense of the time difference more accurately: 23.31.15 difference, if I'm getting it right.

Instead of having the illogical conclusion that dawn at Warsaw is dawn at Corunna or dawn at Harbin is dawn at Kashgar, you now have that system which fits local needs far more precisely as well.

The seconds and minutes part is needed as well to avoid outright disrupting places where the hour-lines pass through, which is what started the jagged lines in the first place. In a diffuse sort of way a city will still work roughly within 2 or so minutes of each other for even the biggest ones, and over time familiarity with the system (London is about 3 minutes from Paris, and so on) will ease such concerns, more along the DMS system overall.

3324,"When it comes to defeating Romania also the Bulgarians and the Turks. 

Because the Emperor of Austria-Hungary panicked like a bitch when Romania joined WW1 saying ""The war is lost"" and the high danger, the Germans sent the best they could to take Romania out as fast as possible (which, considering the state of the Romanian army wasn't that hard) and reduce the risk of Berlin being conquered by Danemark if they entered the war (which could have actually happened in WW1 especially during the wars in Romania). 

So they sent Falkenhain (former chief of staff) and Meckensen (perhaps the best WW1 general) to Romania. Falkenhein led a German army with some Austro-Hungarian soldiers. Meckensen led a mixed German-Bulgarian-Turk army. 

At the end of the day Bucharest was never placed under Hungarian administration but German one, which kinda shows who actually conquered the city in WW1, unlike Budapest which actually was under Romanian administration for the short period of the war. 

So I really don't get why Hungarians compare Bucharest and Budapest when it comes to WW1, or why they the conquering of those 2 cities in any way similar, one is clearly much more embarrassing than the other, but they're probably aware of that, that's why they get triggered so easily by it after all XD ",DeletedMyAccount 7 Times(Can't Stop!

3348,"&gt; Greece cares more about Cyprus than other neighbors for obvious reasons and it wants to see the island reunified, not split in two.

It wants it in its own sphere of influence, is the phrasing.

&gt;  Neither the EU nor Greece would take the waters around it. They would belong to Cyprus. Not Greece, not Turkey. It's a simple concept.

EU does have the water freedom among its members, since Turkey is not in EU, it will be removed from the waters.

&gt; If you're talking about territorial waters you must be REALLY bad at math. Territorial waters are 12 n.m. The distance between Cyprus and Turkey at the closest point is 283 miles. The island's national waters would still be nowhere near. If you're talking about the exclusive economic zone this would be settled just like with every other nation.

Natural resources are the binding issue here so the exclusive economic zone.

&gt; See above. You don't lose YOUR water territory.

Yes you do, you cannot fish in hostile waters.

&gt; Why? Are you sharing Turkey's resources with Israel and Syria? Of course you'd love to share the resources but the question is why would you? The resources would belong to Cyprus.

Israel cannot be sphered by EU, Cyprus can be (and it half done).

&gt; Again, this doesn't make any sense. EU doesn't have borders to stretch. 

It does.

&gt; The EU already has borders with Turkey in many other places and it's perfectly acceptable.

We do not want it to stretch further in the South.

&gt; the borders would still nowhere near your shores. This argument is pure bullshit, you can't justify it any way, you just keep repeating it but it's still nonsense lol.

You clearly have no idea about the law so it is a waste of time. Turkey cannot fish in the waters of a hostile territory, and fishing is the basic thing, petroleum and etc. are there too, which you cannot drill.

&gt; That's like telling me that murder is fine cause.. well.. it happens. Yes it does happen. But it's still condemnable and you keep justifying it. I bet you do the same for the genocides. Sure, it does happen. But it's still an illegal occupation and others call you out for it.

If many do and get away, do not try to lecture me about the unicorns and rainbows.

&gt; Turkish settlers (including fishers) are already in Cyprus so don't worry about that. They'll still be able to fish just for Cyprus. You sent them there on purpose anyway so yeah.. that will happen.

Because Cyprus is held by us half-half, that is why they are there lol. Plus, if Turkey leaves Cyprus, fishers will belong to Cyprus not to Turkey so what kind of bullshit are you talking about here?

&gt; Basically your whole argument rotates around ""i won't be able to illegally exploit another country anymore"" so once again, it perfectly shows your fucked up mentality. No wonder no one likes you people.

It is more like ""The world rotates around this way, so I am adapting it."".

We also have no problem with our neighbors like Georgia and Iran. With Iran, we share the same border for the past 500 years. Not even a single claim was made from any side. So it is not about Turkey only, it is also about Greece's intentions.

&gt;  NATO does have problems when one member is almost going to war with another, let alone when it has a borderline dictatorship under its mantle, with the purpose of antagonizing another borderline dictatorship.

Yeah and it does not. You are a retard if you believe if Turkey and Greece will go to war for Cyprus lol.

Another problem introduced by Daylight Saving Time is that certain local times just do not exist. For example, in the US in 2003, the transition from standard to saving time occurred on April 6, at the change to 2:00:00 local time. The local clock changes from 01:59:59 (standard time) to 03:00:00 (saving time). This means that there is no 02:00:00 through 02:59:59 on April 6!

3435,"What exactly am i full of shit about? Im not saying we are doing enough politically. We arent. Dutch politicians are changing that now.

So the only part you could possibly be so worked up about is me saying that we have the most challenging geography. If it is such ""full of shit"", then why did the EU aknowledge it and allowed the Dutch to have less high aiming goals for green energy?

Also you seem uninformed about offshore ""areas"" for wind. These areas cant be constructed in most of the Dutch northern coast since its world heritage  The waddenzee is a protected natural reserve. One of the few we have left. A lot of the territorial waters at the Holland coastliens are high traffick waterways.

We are investing in very expensive monsterprojects to continue poldering and even creating artificial islands further of the coast. These are incredibly expensive projects.

Biogas is a inneficient and barely applied on massive scales to even suggest that it can greatly help us achieve our goals.

Mega projects is where its at for us, unfortunetely. Thats what you get when youre as densely populated what we are. Imagine tasking New York city with supplying itself with such percentages of green energy. Building a large solar plant on Manhatten is kinda a dumb idea.

Hence im still in favor of using more sensible solutions both in terms of climate as in finances. Use Dutch funds to construct green energy sources in eastern and southern europe. Those regions can use the high paying jobs and projects and theyre even paid for by us. Everyone happy. We dont have to build our little remaining open areas full with massive wind parks, nor do we habr to violate our protected coastlines.

But alas, we prefer to make it a game between member states. Whoever can score ""the highest"". Such childish display.Things like these are what the EU should work on.

Also ""per population""? You seem to severely underestimate how many people live in the Netherlands. 17.000.000 people excluding expats, refugees and illegals is the least amount of coastline per capita except for maybe Belgium and countries that dont have a coastline.

So in practice it's impossible.

I don't think it's useful at all to assign blame.  It's just the way that the EU works, and I think it's a very valid concern.

&gt; what about military agreements between countries?

The future parliament could technically vote to just annul the agreement and ignore it.  You can, reasonably, argue that that it's exactly the same with the EU, but basically you need balance it with practicality.  And I think the EU takes it too far.

3553,"&gt; Well cases of pathology that should be considered is the child abuse by the Catholic Church. 81% of abused children were male. Majority of abusive priests identified themselves as homosexual, and had been abused themselves as children

First of all, most cases of child abuse are committed by family and close family friends, not by the Catholic Church. Focusing on Catholic Church, there is a strong selection bias:

* Priests are all male and chose a life of celibacy among other men. I would expect that the rate of people with perceived problems with their own sexuality is much higher.
* I would expect a lot of those contacts are to boys somehow working for the church (e.g. acolytes)

Homosexual priests are therefore often people not comfortable with their sexuality. They try to suppress (have to, celibacy), they struggle with themselves, they see themselves doomed not matter what they do (because homosexuality is a sin in Christian believe). Homosexuals comfortable with their own sexuality are much more likely to view themselves as members of the general society, bound by the rules of the society, and therefore bound to keep their hands off from minors.

The other study you mention is about *being* abused and *afterwards* turning homosexual. While this will probably rub some activists the wrong way because it basically indicates that homosexuality can be a learned habit and is not always a congenital disposition, I find it entirely feasible that people can have a traumatic experience, which impacts their future sexual choices. Especially when there was previously some latent bisexual disposition. 

(*Note:  I'm not saying this is often the case. I can fully accept that most homosexuals are homosexual hard-wired in their brain, and I see absolutely no point whatsoever to try to ""convert"" a homosexual.*)",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7svfe8/homosexuality_clearly_produces_pathologies_judge/dt9hpbl/,silentsoylent,1516953971

1. Turkey is an important NATO ally which means other members have no interest in seeing it fragmented and most importantly setting a dangerous precedent of a NATO member being partitioned at the negotiation table by or with the help of other NATO members. 

Also Turkey is stable af in comparison with the madness around it and makes no sense to take action that would just destibilize it.

Which leads to 2nd reason:

From what i know the kurdish people are living in east and south east turkey and in the regions adiacent to that meaning in a highly unstable region already.

By supporting yet another state to be created there will mean current existing ones will have to take the loss in teritory and population and you can bet everything on the fact that would help radicalise even more people and generate even more fighting.

I personally would like to see a  Kurdish state since they are probably the only nation that did not manage to get own state after the fall of the Ottoman Empire.

Youth today are less racist than any generation before.

Youth today are less sexist than any generation before.


Your views are conservative, and by and large, yes, people like you are decreasing as time passes on.


In 1958 in the US, interracial marriage had less than 10% public approval.

Now it stands at 86%, and the vast majority of the remaining hold-outs are old people.

Acceptance of homosexuality is as high as it has ever been. This is the onward march of progress. 

And no, conservatives don't like it. They don't like progress on issues of equality. It's just in their nature. And apparently your.


More than ever progress is being made. And it really bothers some people.

That is why we are hearing about those angry about progress.

It's not that there are more racists today, it's that they feel the need to speak out more against the progress that has been made.


Progress in racial equality angers those that don't want racial equality.

Progress in gay rights angers those that don't want gays to have equal rights.



They can feel the world turning against their views and are screaming out in anger and desperation.

In America in 2016 Trump harnessed their anger.


But that is what you might call a ""dead cat bounce"", because changing demographics and views are very clear and theres nothing you or anyone else can do about it. Trump is nothing more than a hiccup in the  historical trajectory of progress. 



During the civil rights era, racists were so angry at the Democrats championing civil rights that southern racists fled the Democratic party and went to the Republican party. The Republicans used this to hold the south using racial animosity of whites.

It hasn't stopped progress though. The civil rights act still passed. The voting rights act still passed.

Views on race and equality are changing, and for the better. This ""resurgence"" of white nationalism and white supremacy is just white racial resentment welling up in response to more equality.


It won't stop progress.


By 2050, the US won't even be a majority white country. I'm white, but I don't care. Things change, laws change, demographics change.  When I'm dead and gone, will I care whether the US is majority white? NO. Not at all.


Try to identify less with your ""whiteness"" and more with just being ""one of the many humans.""



I am sorry you feel the way you do, but these changes are going to happen no matter how angry they make you.

I feel a little relief in that I like and want these changes. I can't imaging being against all this progress we've made as a people. I feel sorry for those that are. It must be rough seeing society champion the things you hate.

Not a problem if the UK is part of Future Europe, but the UK has just decided that she likely will not be part of that for at least some time to come.  So one way or another, it's one more headache that the UK has to figure out a solution to, via aligning herself with Future Europe, allying, joining something else, relying on her own ability to deter, etc.

Historically, she established defensive alliances so that she was never on the weaker side in Europe and so that nobody could conquer potential allies to the point that she'd be forced to be on the weaker side.  But if there's one faction that's overwhelmingly powerful in Europe moving forward, European defensive alliances won't be an option moving forward.  Right now, there's NATO, one defensive alliance with lots of parties spanning all of Europe, which I imagine is pretty much the British ideal.

Numbeo has a good comparison tool [here](https://www.numbeo.com/property-investment/region_rankings.jsp?title=2018&amp;region=150). They don't have an income-to-rent index but a price-to-income index. I think in many cases they will track each other quite closely.

First, wages should always be PPP-adjusted. [According to the OECD](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=AV_AN_WAGE#), Poland has close to 26K USD per year in wages once adjusted for PPP. Italy is at 35K. So there is a difference, but not a massive one. On top of that, Poland's economy is growing 5% on a YoY basis and real wages are tracking that (nominal wages growing between 6.5-7% YoY, but remove inflation and you get around 5% real wage growth). 

Further, emigration is not what caused low unemployment either. This is the [lump of labour fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy).

Thessaloniki was jewish majority at the time.

Greece and bulgaria had population exchange. Bulgarians left macedonia and went to bulgaria and greeks left eastern rumelia and came to greece.

Monastiri was a greek majority town. Greece never had population exchange with serbia so most of the greeks stayed in vardarska and the regime had the greek names changed to slavic names. Why do you think city had a greek name until serbs took it?

&gt;no greeks living there

There are greeks living in fyrom we just dont know how many. There are also people that fled to vardarska after 50's greek civil war. When germans occupied fyrom they fount 100k in 700k population. In 50s it was 150k and some say that now there are 200k thats 10%. 30% albanian 5% roma 5% turks then there are greeks serbs.

What they did do was convince many Sanders supporters that the DNC attempted to influence the primaries against Sanders instead of acting as a neutral party, for one. They also outlined ways they wanted to execute political hitjobs. For example, in one case, they discussed creating a fake advertisement for a job in the Trump Organization that would make him look sexist.

Neither are Hillary Clinton's emails insignificant. You can freely go look at them yourself. For example:

&gt;According to the latest leaked emails, Mrs Clinton told a Goldman Sachs conference she would like to intervene secretly in Syria.
&gt;She made the remark in answer to a question from Lloyd Blankfein, the bank's chief executive, in 2013 months after she left office as secretary of state.
&gt;""My view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene,"" she told employees of the bank in South Carolina, which had paid her about $225,000 to give a speech.
&gt;Mrs Clinton - who is accused of being a war hawk by liberal critics - added: ""We used to be much better at this than we are now. Now, you know, everybody can't help themselves.
&gt;""They have to go out and tell their friendly reporters and somebody else: Look what we're doing and I want credit for it.""

The transparency into Clinton's real intentions is priceless of course. Many Americans were tired of meddling in the middle east.

About salaries, it really depends. I can't comment on other industries, but specifically programming pays well, I make 1.3k euros a month, after taxes, with one year of experience. Which lets me live very comfortably and save some money. Also the socialist stuff - free education, no need to sell your soul for university, a lot cheaper medical care, guaranteed 20 work days of paid vacation every year.

That kind of money lets me rent my own apartment, have retirement savings, basic needs, I have newest phone, 4k 55' tv, ps4, from time to time I like to go to expensive restaurant(literally the most expensive, and according to ratings the best in lithuania restaurant, costs 30-60 euros per dinner, it's not even that much), go to cinema or theater, I travel to Asia on my vacation. The things that are harder with this kind of money are global goods which usually have set price worldwide. Stuff like electronics take away a bigger portion of your salary. Buying brand new cars becomes hard. Global streaming services like netflix cost absolutely the same, but our salary compared to countries like US is smaller, so that means that netflix costs more relatively to your salary.

About interacting with communities, I like going to programming and film making events, and there are often english speaking speakers. And every time they seem welcomed by everyone, so if you want to, you definitely can interact and be accepted by local communities.

The republic of Turkey was a continuation of the Ottoman Empire. Similar to how the kingdom of France became the French Republic.

However, what you say is actually very telling. It demonstrates to us that the ""discussion"" around the whole issue is highly politicised and is based more and more on political bias, as opposed to facts and nuances which influence the situation on the ground. Everybody oversimplifies the situation and makes it black and white, when it's really not that simple. It never is that simple.

The Kurdish issue in Turkey is not something that has been going on for the last twenty years, nor the last fifty. It quite possibly reaches back a century or two, and with it, brings with it a lot of historical baggage. Political bias in analysing this issue devalues the entire discussion and debate. It detracts from the fact that both sides in this conflict have fair points, and especially from the fact that Kurds have legitimate grievances, not only in Turkey, but also due to other countries in the region.

However, it should not be forgotten that the Kurds, just like almost any other nation in the world, are a diverse and varied people. The PYD does not mean ""Kurdish National Party"" and the YPG does not mean ""Kurdish Armed Forces"". Yes, there are Kurds who support the PYD, but there are also Kurds who support Jalal Talabani's PUK, and Kurds who support Massoud Barzani's KDP. There are also Kurds who support the AKP in Turkey, in fact, with this ratio being surprisingly high.

Therefore, I believe that you are actually pointing out something very important.

3916,"The swedish tyrants were often ""progressive"" and relatively liberal even if they were bloodthirsty,they also often took the side of the people against the nobles. The russian tyrants were rarely liberal and they never took the side of the people.

Russia has always been more influenced by asia than most of europe for example with the links to Constantinople and the dominance of the mongols in the early states of Russia.

I think Russia permanently diverged from the european mainstream in the late 19th century,Finland for example is fully western today but they got out just before things went to hell in the Russian empire.

The soviets themselves were a misguided and brutal attempt to westernize a eurasian country. Ironically they only cemented Russias position as something ""other"" than western civilization because they alienated so much of the western world with their sheer brutality. 

Russia will never be fully european because Russia itself sees Europe as something to be fought,a corrupting influence and a danger. The entire russian culture is founded on this belief that you are different from us,if you were to suddenly change this view fundamentally Russia would just become a giant version of Poland instead of the pseudo rogue state it is today. 

Although this would be good for the world it would also mean that your corrupt and morally bankrupt leaders would lose their favourite scapegoat,it would no longer be so easy for them to use anti-western sentiments to drum up their subjects into nationalistic hysteria.  

Your leaders started this new cold war against us because they were afraid of losing their position of power when their own population began to demand more western freedoms. Im simply dissappointed that the average russian then blindly followed their leader when he started a war against an innocent nation. Russia can't let Ukraine become a successful western nation because that would validate the westernizers inside Russia and their fight for more rights and democracy.",Scania,/r/europe/comments/7sxnv3/population_of_two_major_russian_cities_moscow_and/dt8vhkx/,lowenmeister,1516923922
3917,"You just don't realize how powerful ""low cost of living"" can be. A bit of an extreme example, but I used to live on 130‚Ç¨/mo for two people in Eastern Ukraine. We didn't pay rent because it was our property (but even if we did, it would've been 80‚Ç¨/mo. All utilities combined were 20‚Ç¨, so all of our expenses were food and smoking (both a pack a day, 30‚Ç¨ total). We basically lasted three weeks on that money while having a pretty decent diet all things considered, although the utilities and the rest of the month were subsidized by our family. 

Point is, with 200‚Ç¨ and healthier habits, we could've even had money left at the end of the month.

Later we had 600‚Ç¨ available as budget, and I calculated that in order to get a ""similar"" quality of life as in Italy, you'd need at least 1700‚Ç¨/mo which is frankly a high salary here. The calculation includes 300‚Ç¨ for big expenses/saving, so your iPhone purchase capability would be the same.

3926,"Depends on what you want to achieve. Closed camps in Europe might work to deter people who would not qualify for asylum for obvious reasons. On top of that the people without claims for asylum must also not believe the stories the people smugglers tell them. 

But closed camps in Europe won't deter people who are eligible for asylum. Among those 2300 many would fall into that category. Once a refugee receives asylum, they must not be treated worse than comparable legal immigrants. Which means they are free to choose where they want to live in their host country. It's the law, I know, just ignore the law, because fuck it, but thankfully here in Europe we follow the law. 

The Australian solution works because these closed camps aren't in Australia. So the asylum seekers don't fall under Australian jurisdiction and will therefor never have a chance to get refugee status in Australia (unless Australia decides to voluntarily pick them up). For what it's worth, the closed camps in Papua New Guinea don't have to be closed camps at all. And they don't even have to be on an island. As long as they aren't in Australia. 

The Australian solution is very much comparable to the EU-Turkey deal. For the individual EU countries without external borders the Dublin Regulations are also comparable to the Australian solution. The point of the Australian solution is that they aren't in your country, and don't have a right to enter your country because they are in another safe country.

They are definitely NOT comparable! In one case you have a mob of 40-50 people and in the other one you have the [special force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_Mobilisation_Group) of your military organising it! With 300.000 people!

How is 

""Greek mobs consisted of approximately 40 to 50 people running wild, breaking windows, beating people and vandalizing cars"" 

comparable to

""Apart from the thirty identified victims, an additional of three unidentified bodies were found inside the shops, while three burned bodies were found in a sack in the region of Besiktas. Moreover, 32 Greeks were severely wounded. Men and women were raped and islamized by force, and according to accounts including those of the Turkish writer Aziz Nesin, men, including a priest, were subjected to forced circumcision by members of the mob. Priests were also scalped and burnt in their beds and Greek women raped""

Which translates to According to the Minister of Education, a distinct percentage of the seats can be allocated to the Muslim minority of Thrace

[2525/1997](http://www.fa3.gr/nomothesia_2/nomoth_education/14-nomos_2525-97.htm): The only relevant part I can see is Article 2, sectio 4, subsection vii) that says that this article is also applicable to the people mentioned in article 2.1 in 2341/1995. Also below says that the percentages etc of each category are decided by the Minister of Education (all the categories mentioned in Article 2 section 4)

Each year the seats of every University are decided, but with no standard quota for the special categories and you can see that no 0.5% is mentioned anywhere. Also:

You can count them yourself, under ŒëŒ°ŒßŒôŒöŒïŒ£ ŒòŒïŒ£ŒïŒôŒ£. You will see they are WAY higher than 500 while the seats generally were at ~68.500

And of course many other Muslims are living in the city and speak Greek perfectly fine so they have no problem entering with the normal grades. As for the seats, you can see that they are higher than 0.5% AND they are never totally covered. Which means even more could enter 

&gt;the 50s were a bad time for the country, thats why the pogrom happened. Oh wait if I said something like that again, lynch mob. You cannot claim these things were not comparable, but then claim ignorance when I prove it to be a hell of a lot more comparable. 

They are definitely NOT comparable! In one case you have a mob of 40-50 people and in the other one you have the [special force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_Mobilisation_Group) of your military organising it! With 300.000 people!

How is 

""Greek mobs consisted of approximately 40 to 50 people running wild, breaking windows, beating people and vandalizing cars"" 

comparable to

""Apart from the thirty identified victims, an additional of three unidentified bodies were found inside the shops, while three burned bodies were found in a sack in the region of Besiktas. Moreover, 32 Greeks were severely wounded. Men and women were raped and islamized by force, and according to accounts including those of the Turkish writer Aziz Nesin, men, including a priest, were subjected to forced circumcision by members of the mob. Priests were also scalped and burnt in their beds and Greek women raped""

I'm not defending the events of 1990, I totally despise them. But comparing events of a handful of idiots smashing shops and cars 3 years after [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_Aegean_crisis) and after the events of Cyprus to thousands of organised from the government killing, with arsons, rapes, forced circumcisions in the middle of the street etc, when our relations were fine for almost 30 years, after [this pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_Pact_\(1953\)), for fake news that were already discredited as fake!

As for Poland being an example against that, well that is true, but Poland is a weird ass country when it comes to respect and just basically liking others. I mean look at how Poles and Polish media continue to always mention how Germans are buying out Poland. I guess cause they dislike Germans for historic reasons. While actually the main country buying out Poland is France. With the ex-national but still all powerful telecommunications company TP SA now being France Telecom owned and using the Orange brand. Also many of city services, at least in Warsaw (like providing essential heat in the winter a former city owned company now owned by french Veolia). Plus the fact that when it comes to hypermarkets Poland is an Auchan/Carrefour colony with Tesco struggling behind. Yet despite all that very visible data (confirmed by real economic data, even official stuff), it's the still the Germans who are being seen as the bad guys and the French still as ""our friends"" by Poles, who are furious that international companies are buying out Polish companies and services.

Renewables need a lot more storage.

To take the UK as an example, daily demand in winter varies between approx 30 GW and 50 GW. With about 40 GW of nuclear we'd need about 50 GWH of storage.

However, intermittent renewables like wind and solar can suffer prolonged periods of low output. If we had 50 GW of wind, a typical winter wind lull in the UK would result in 3 weeks of low output and a total deficit of 8 TWH.

I rent it out to friends and my prices are considered rock bottom and unrealistic and people wonder why I take such low prices ( I do because I don't want the problems, and renting to friends means no problems). So for the 80m2 apartment for 2-4 people I ask 2500 zloty. And that is the ""rock bottom low price"" as many people want 3500-4000 or even more for rent of a similar property in downtown Warsaw. This may be not much in Euros, but... the so called average Polish salary (boosted by the rich) is at about 4000 zloty. The median Polish salary which says a lot more is at about 2300 zloty, so not even enough to rent. Add to this the fact that I've recently been looking for property as investment and I've learned that I can actually buy an attractive property near the seaside in Spanish Costa del Sol, but can't afford a similar apartment to later rent out in the Polish resort towns of Sopot, Swinoujscie or Kolobrzeg...

3993,"&gt;The swedish tyrants were often ""progressive"" and relatively liberal even if they were bloodthirsty,they also often took the side of the people against the nobles.  

Even if it's true for Sweden, which it might not be, it definitely isn't for other core European countries. Ever heard of Hitler? Colonial escapades that led to millions of deaths of commoners? So much for being liberal. That was less than a century ago, practically nothing on the timeline of human civilization. 


&gt; Russia will never be fully european because Russia itself sees Europe as something the be fought,a corrupting influence and a danger.

Is it supposed to be treated some other way, other than a danger? How many times have the European nations brought ruin to Russia? The Poles, the Crusaders, the Germans, the French? Was there any serious attempt made at reconciliation after the end the Cold War?   
But other than that, are you confident that the current state of affairs, the united Europe, is permanent? Once Pax Americana goes tits up, all bets are off, you'll have Europeans at each others' throats again as if the EU never happened. Not to mention, eventually the so-called Western civilization will be tried itself, considering its demographics and demographics of Asia and Africa, that's not something that would contribute to peace, prosperity, and unity.

This is actually a big chance for Russia as it could just abandon (in a way) the West when it loses importance (and it will, these things changed through the centuries and will change again). Having two relatively Western and one Eastern important city, Russia would have the unique position of having the best of both worlds when changes do come. But the Putin government seems to fail to see this. Or maybe the importance of it, as it's not like Vladivostok does not see investment. I've been there 3 years ago. The place actually looks nicer than the average Russian city and investments in infrastructure seem clearly visible. The thing is that it needs much more companies, industry and population to rival Moscow or St. Pete and while the city is growing due to local migration, those changes are slow to come.

4018,"&gt; the most commercialized place and it gets a lot of attention

That is not really true. It might be true overall across Romania but our tourism lacks many things, including these. I already explained this in the past. My town alone gets lots of foreign visitors, probably among the top, but that because of Bran. Other than that, a lot of the people that find their way to the center or other parts of the city had no idea what to expect or they got informed by other foreign visitors or advertisers. The good part is that they are impressed after they find out.

We do not promote much. I think some of our neighboring countries have up to a few times more visitors that we ever had. Anyway, sometimes my town is excluded from some of the tourist guides made by romanians but that I can blame on their lack of knowledge of their own country. I think the most advertised city in Transylvania is Cluj. Do you personally know much about Covasna or Harghita, which have a lot of beautiful places, or Mures (aside from Sighisoara), or Bistrita? Most of the Transylvania is unknown to romanians. I can name a few smaller towns in my city, which are very nice, and lots of romanians would say they never heard of those names or how it looks like. If we don't know, foreigners know even less.

Lastly what's the best thing you like about the English language?, And what's the one thing you hate about the English language?...



Most of the young people are able to keep the basic conversation going. To finish an upper secondary school, you need to pass a level B2 exam from your 1st foreign language which in most cases is English. Yes, I can hear my accent and don't like it,- friend of mine doesn't give a damn.

*Pros:* relatively easy to learn (not as easy as Slavic languages), opens the world

*Cons:* writing system is a mess + some grammar rules are weird for us.



&gt;Former Soviet Union socialist republic known Czeckoslovakia



Just no . . . (Czechoslovakia yes, former USSR republic? Definitely no)



&gt;Homosexuality



Big no again . . . Slovaks are conservative just as Polish, This means that marriage between man and woman is protected by constitution and any official bond between same sexes is prohibited.



&gt;what's the ordinary Slovak person's opinion of Slovakia's past, present and above all future?



Life in these lands was, is and will always be rough. (We are generally pessimist with can't do attitude)



&gt;Just what do you learn about the UK?... I was also wondering how do you view the UK and British people(and culture too)?. Do you like Brits or not??..



Depends. In primary school you are taught the basics, - geography, political geography and some basic history (colonial empire, USA, WW1, how GBR back stabbed us in Munich, WW2) maybe something more at English lessons. If you decide for upper secondary school, you will learn more history (100y war, act of union, 7years war etc.) Then it only depends if you want to take more history class or not.


I personally have bad experience with Brits (Englishman to be precise) so . . .



&gt;I know most Slovak men are uncut. Lotsa foreskin!



I guess. This whole concept is just weird for us I guess.



&gt;Is racism and or xenophobia commonplace or not?. How are black, mixed race and asians, non-whites treated &amp; viewed? Are they a common sight?. And how are foreigners treated &amp; viewed?, Are they a common sight too?



Racism is openly accepted by society. Don't get a wrong image, we don'r crucify blacks on the streets. As long as there are no problems with you, you should be fine, especially as a tourist. But we would be definitely considered racist by ""western standards"".



&gt;What's the Slovak view of sex and porn?



You can talk about it between friends, but I guess it's taboo broadly speaking.



&gt;Is Feminism a thing in Slovakia?



I don't think so.



&gt;What does the Slovak school cirriculum consist of?



Basic stuff in primary: Slovak l.(mother tongue,- if you are Hungarian you will learn Hungarian), mathematics, 1st foreign l. (6 years old), 2nd foreign l. (10 years old), biology, physics, chemistry, civics, PE, work w/ computer, basics of music, basics of art and some other optional things . . .

Then it depends on your choice of secondary school (15 years old)



&gt;Like just what is the everyday diet for most Slovak people?



+-potatoes, dairy products some vegetables(cabbage, onion, garlic, horseradish) chicken, pork, occasionally beef or fish.

Definitely can recommend Bryndzov√© halu≈°ky or Kapustnica



&gt;What types of music are popular in Slovakia?



Depends on the person.



&gt; how would you describe your average Slovakian person?



Looks unfriendly and shy, but if you break the ice he will be your good friend for a long time. But you can't describe 5M people in one sentence.



&gt;what's it like living in a country with no coast and access to the sea?



¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø



&gt;where do you think Slovakia would be today if you'd of never of joined the EU and got that huge injection of money?



I guess we would be Ukraine v2.0, who knows . . 



&gt;To any Slovaks reading when it comes to alcohol have you ever tried and do you like cider and ale?



I had both but none of them were ""truly British"" so I can't really tell. Slovaks in general are fans of ""Lager"" beers since Czechs taught us what is good :)



&gt;Can Czechs and Slovaks understand each other?



Yes. Sometimes you don't understand a few words, but you understand what he wants to tell you.



&gt;Just what is the relationship in the 21st century like between Slovakia/Slovaks and the Czech Republic/Czechs



I would say that relations are better than ever. Most people from Slovakia consider Czechs brothers and same can be said about Czech view on Slovaks.",,/r/europe/comments/7s8aqv/what_do_you_know_about_slovakia/dt8p4cu/,jozoraz6,1516917526

I dont really remember this happening, I dont think they really should have commented on this, but I think its safe to say: someone in Poland setting themself on fire in protest, has mental issues.

&gt; Warsaw's streets were filled with more than 60,000 people marching in an Independence Day parade organized by far-right groups that included chants of ""pure Poland, white Poland"" and banners decrying Islam, immigrants and homosexuals.

While technically true, very misleading - there were literally 4-5 racist banners among 60k that celebrated regaining Independence. 

&gt; Several Law and Justice members of Parliament joined the march,

As it is their right, just like everyone elses.

&gt; the Minister of Interior, Mariusz Blaszczak, later called it ""a beautiful sight.""

I agree, a sea of Poland white/red flags and thousands of people singing the national anthem was quite beautiful. A couple of idiots doesnt ruin the whole march. Additionally, that quote was from the same day, when he wasnt aware yet of the racist banners.

&gt; There is not much room for political opposition in Poland these days 

I think you mean the opposition (sadly) cant find much room in Poland because most are totally useless.


&gt; as the country embraces the social conservatism of Law and Justice that is transforming nearly every aspect of society and sending shock waves across Europe.

Any examples of this or just more empty words? What exactly has changed in the Polish society?

In the century before the genocide, Armenians could be killed, their women raped, their property stolen without any consequence. They were not speak in courts and were always guilty against Muslims. The Ottoman government created the Hamidiye, a paramilitary, for the sole purpose of massacring and pillaging Armenians. While being killed for sport literally like wild beasts, Armenians were not allowed to own guns or ride horses. Turkish and Kurdish chieftains that massacred Armenian villages were awarded medals by Ottoman officials like a general might be for winning a battle. Armenians were overtaxed 60% of their income.

Our government has historically been very anti-nuclear, but they are loosening up on that more and more. They removed the deadline for getting rid of our last nuclear reactors for example, and they have made it at least possible to update existing ones (it used to be impossible, due to the phase-out policy). Still far from any push for development in that area by the government, but it's not exactly inconceivable. 

&gt;you can't change the mind of millions of people

I disagree, that is definitely possible to do. But not if we don't talk about it. Especially in this case since it's mostly an ideologically driven issue, not scientific or economic or whatever (although that also plays a role, obviously). 

About 40% of Swedes support continuing use of nuclear power and updating the current reactors. Don't need to convince that many to be in a majority. ",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/7sv54b/share_of_renewables_in_energy_consumption_in_the/dt8gfvu/,Eff5850528,1516909479

For 2018:

* Federal spending was $4.09 trillion.

* State spending was $1.85 trillion.

* Local spending (like, city governments) was $1.92 trillion.

If you want a breakdown of what each spends on, they [also have a breakdown](https://www.usgovernmentspending.com/breakdown).  For the federal government, the big items for 2017 are pensions at $1 trillion, health care at $1.1 trillion, education at $0.2 trillion, military at $0.8 trillion, and federal welfare at $0.4 trillion.

Local budget can probably be combined with state from the standpoint of talking about ""authority"" -- there's no US Constitution-mandated separation between those, and any guarantees on independence would be up to the rules that the state's constitution sets.  States don't normally approve city budgets (though when Detroit went bankrupt, the state assigned a [bankruptcy manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevyn_Orr) for a period of time), but I suppose that as long as their state constitution permits it, they could do so.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7sw9he/europe_will_never_be_ambitious_enough_with_27/dt8gkav/,vokegaf,1516909589

How weird that the author doesnt mention the 8 years long depression this man has suffered from...

&gt;Warsaw's streets were filled with more than 60,000 people marching in an Independence Day parade organized by far-right groups that included chants of ""pure Poland, white Poland"" and banners decrying Islam, immigrants and homosexuals.

Anyone that would bother to look into things knows this is as dishonest description as it could be.

&gt;There is not much room for political opposition.

In what way? Was it delegalized? Put into prisons?

&gt;The organization has seen the incidence of hate crimes soar from a few per week to several a day

I wonder where? The stats are known, the rate of ""hate crimes"" is actually declining. Also, vast majority of it is ""commited"" in the internet.

&gt;Mr. Marzoch has lived in Sweden, but will not be going back, convinced that immigration has ruined that country.
""I think that all of the right-wing movements, and especially National Movement, care about Poland and Poles in a good way, and care about our national interests. Also they care about the tradition of our forefathers,"" he said adding that most of his friends feel the same.

What a horrible criminal!

&gt;""Kaczynski told people: 'You are included. You are in. It's about you,'"" said Slawomir Sierakowski, who heads a Warsaw think tank called Political Critique. ""Kaczynski is not just a crazy, traditional idiot. It's the opposite. He represents for them a strong state.""
In the 2015 election, Law and Justice swept to power, winning control of parliament and taking the presidency. 

Huh, how dare PiS be inclusive about polish citizens? What do they think it is, some sort of democracy?

&gt;""We must try to consolidate Polish society at large along the lines of positive Polish traditions and values,"" Mr. Kaczynski told the Financial Times last year.

&gt;The move could cost Poland its EU voting rights and jeopardize its EU funding. ""This is not just about Poland, it is about the EU as a whole,"" Frans Timmermans, deputy head of the European Commission, said in explaining the unprecedented action. 

He is right about that. Its about the european commision trying to get more power. They didnt succed writing it into a treaty, so they try to make it happen by method of accomplished facts, to create a precedent.

Thanks to the West and their sub par integration of immigrants from that region. If they can't do it properly, why would a much poorer country do better?

&gt;  can understand Islamophobia of some say Paris residents who happen to live in a bad immigrant nieghbourhood. But I don‚Äôt understand the Polish hate. 

We look at the terrorist attacks and the crime perpetrated there, so why would we want to bring it here? I'm not saying that I believe this idea, but allowing thousands of low skill migrants who live in ghettos is probably not the best idea.

4159,"Firstly, thanks for replying.

Secondly, I didn't say that statement was incorrect,

&gt; Arthur Guinness was a Protestant, a Unionist and Irish and British

more that the article was, which I will come to later.

Arthur Guinness was indeed a Protestant, and accepted the Act of Union which was enacted in his own lifetime (it was in 1800 and he died in 1803). However, he was more in favour of the Parliamentary system brought forward by Henry Grattan in the 1780s/90s, which was having an independent Irish Parliament (albeit still subservient to London), more than an actual Union itself. He was against full Irish independence, but still was supporter of Catholic Emancipation (Catholics in Ireland made up 80%+ of the population, but were all forbidden from voting) which was unusual at the time. To say that he was British would be incorrect though, as he was born on the island of Ireland to Irish parents of Irish origin, and identified as such, with Guinness being an Irish name - besides, being an Irish unionist didn't/doesn't necessarily make one ""British"", it just means they want a union between Ireland and Britain. Of course, many Irish unionists did/do consider themselves both British and Irish, with Guinness' descendants being examples in later centuries.

The article itself is particularly slanted, the first example of which can be seen in the title - it is specifically aimed towards Irish Americans. The author attempts to correct some misconceptions that may be held by that population, but in doing so, paints a picture which is even more misrepresentative. The author claims that there is this ""one"" version of Irishness and Irish history out there, and correctly wants to remedy that, but in doing so makes generalisations that are just as bad and doesn't achieve a balanced view at all. These claims are in particular about Irish history, people and religion.

His selective quotes from De Valera in particular are completely taken out of context, and he neglects to mention that Ireland never had Catholicism as the official state religion, which was done by other countries at the same time period (France, Italy, Spain). He speaks of the Ancient Order of Hibernians and Republican Sinn F√©in as if they speak for all Irish nationalist people. 

Throughout the whole article he incorrectly equates Irish protestantism with Unionism or a British identity, and even goes as far to quote WB Yeats, which is ridiculous since Yeats a Protestant but also a nationalist icon. The inherently and overtly Catholic Ireland image he tries to invoke ignores the fact that even our first President was Anglican. He declares that healthcare is free in NI but not in the Republic, which is only partially true. He equates the Ulster Covenant with the Easter Proclamation - a better comparison would be the 1918 general election. He says ""Home Rule would be Rome Rule"", ignoring the fact that any religious discrimination in Home Rule was forbidden by statute and Westminster would have had to intervene. He ignores the rampant and horrific human rights offences committed on Catholics in NI, yet also ignores that in Ireland, Protestants were elected to the highest offices of state, not once but twice *in nine Presidents*, while still being a much smaller minority, in complete religious freedom and generous state funding for their schools.

There is nothing about St Patricks Day in the rest of Ireland that is an ""exclusively and explicitly Catholic parade, and anti-Protestant Unionist"" - maybe in NI, but that's just a sectarian state for you.

So yeah, that's my thoughts on the article. He tries to balance the image of some Irish-Americans but just ends up making things worse, by generalising all Protestants as Unionists, among many other misconceptions.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/7scv5f/a_dozen_ways_to_divide_the_united_kingdom/dt8h5y4/,El-Daddy,1516910143

It's inevitable. If homosexuality is indeed primarily caused by hormonal disbalance in the womb, then we'll be able to rectify this disbalance and largely eliminate homosexuality in the developed world. Checking for this hormonal disbalance during routine antenatal tests will eventually be cheap, easy, and quick, and mothers will be given the choice to ensure that their children are born heterosexual. Few will decline, because mothers want the best and easiest possible life for their children, and even if LGBT people weren't discriminated against, there are still plenty of disadvantages to being a homosexual(e.g a much smaller dating pool, the inability to naturally procreate with your partner).",France,/r/europe/comments/7svfe8/homosexuality_clearly_produces_pathologies_judge/dt8hler/,Raduev,1516910542

4210,"&gt; Also, what do you mean your definition of racism is in group favoritism? You mean that to you racism only takes into account that sort of discrimination¬ø

yes and it's often use to measure racism. but the problem with this idea of in-group focus or bias against whatever is not the in-group is that it's almost impossible to proof this is the sole reason for harmful effects on the out-group.

the example being lets say there is a bunch of dudes of group1 and a bunch on dudes of group2 now group 1 does not like group2 and therefore discriminates against group2 (the colloquial use of racism)

in this example it is impossible to establish if the reason for the dislike is legitimate or not. it's impossible to establish this is solely due to whatever our definition of race or in-group might be.

the reason that this is almost impossible to establish is that as you said in any grouping of people there are an almost infinite set of inter group differences. so if i discriminate against the average black man is this due to their skin color or due to the fact that they are taller? how can you know that there is not some unmeasured variable that influences either my decision or their character? 

consider the fact that random sampling is not unbiased in social science due to these correlations with other factors, can we measure anything we might call racist or any form of illegitimate discrimination?

and if we can't measure it even does it exist?


this is what i mean by skeptical epistemology, a method that questions the possibility of certainty in knowledge.",,/r/europe/comments/7svfe8/homosexuality_clearly_produces_pathologies_judge/dt88dyx/,mana_addict,1516902137

&gt;And before some Pole chimes in and says that those neonazis were a tiny minority and PiS won out of the disillusion of the majority towards Tusk, here's a quote from Martin Luther King:

Another quote with a quote...

&gt;No problems in Poland at all, apart from swastika-embracing hitlerites, thousands of white supremacists, retards beating Turkish children and so forth.

They are located in the world's most advantageous geopolitical position bridging Europe's most underdeveloped region (the Balkans) which is also its weakest point (2 world wars started there) with the Middle East which is also a hotpoint and crucial for shipping and oil. They control the Bosphorus Straight which limits Russia's ability to project its naval forces and last but not least they have an 80 million strong market and a huge middle class.

4269,"You've just given one example of getting wealthy which is not even entirely connected to the independence (the Irish example I mean). Lots of African countries got independent, they are still shitholes. So being independent couldn't be directly related to being wealthy or improved. North Korea is independent too. So? They're (PKK and its branches) planning on a communist state anyway, so they will end up with being a Transdiniester, Cuba, North Korea etc. which doesn't really bother me as long as they don't demand things from Turkey. 

Calling me a racist is not an argument. Comparing Kurdish to Chinese is just ludicrous, and I'm sure you know why, I don't even need to explain it here (see: Chinese history, literature, math and science ). Kurdish doesn't even have a complete standard, a developed written literature etc (and please don't give me that oppression Olympics bullshit, I have tons of counter examples such as the Azeri Turks, Balkanic people, Jews etc when it comes to being ""oppressed"" yet still being able to be prolific in terms of literature and science). 

Back to the topic, they can and should leave but not every Turk has to agree with me. Some of them regard the lands that they have as a part of their identity, some of them think no matter how shitty the given areas are they are still Turkish territories and their/our soldiers died for that part of the mainland. Therefore no one can just take it like that just because they don't feel like behaving and being normal citizens. To me that's just bullshit and I personally don't agree on not giving a territory just because our ancestors blah blah... but I do think there are legitimate reasons to think in that way too. Besides we're talking about PKK and its supporters. I have met so many Kurds not wanting shit in terms of being independent. They just live their lives and mind their own business. 

I don't even know why you've just brought up the Armenian thing haha. Dude, get over with it. People did horrible shit back in the days. They killed, conquered, ruled and got killed, conquered and ruled too. There's no reason to be butthurt. It's like the USA ruling the world right now. People should stop playing the victim and get their shit together instead of bitching like pussies. So many Turks were killed and being killed right now (Tatars, Azeris, Uyghurs...), I have never blamed Russia or China for their current failure nor have I given any credit to being oppressed for their success. Failure and success have so many variables, it's just naive to blame oppression for everything. Plus, Kurds had not been doing great before the Turks came and conquered Anatolia either anyway.

I mean, I think that more skilled immigration to the EU would be advantageous to the EU.  My belief is that the EU would already have done this, if they had been able to politically swing it, and that it was only the fact that they probably would not have been able to get immigration in sufficient numbers past voters -- but could manage refugees, due to treaty obligations -- that makes refugee-based immigration play such a large role in EU immigration.

It happened 300 years ago. But Russians understand humiliation, so to them it makes sense that we hate them for that. Same with every other international thing that happens.

&gt;# Europe needs Blair‚Äôs leadership and ability


&gt;Will Tony Blair re-enter politics as the European Union‚Äôs first president? This tantalising idea has been dangled in front of Europe‚Äôs leaders by Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president. Immediately, the ancient mariner of EU politics, Valery Giscard d‚ÄôEstaing, stepped forth to say the former British prime minister cannot be EU president because Britain is insufficiently European. He was backed by a former right-wing French premier, Edouard Balladur. Events, time and the emergence of other names will decide whether Mr Blair wants to give up earning pots of gold and mobilise support to start earning the decent but relatively modest emolument of a top EU official.

&gt;But what is the new president of the EU? For a start, he or she is not the president of Europe.

You're not following enough feminists then. I follow most people in the House of Representatives of my country and they are all making a fuss about this, even though the problem isn't really that prevalent here. 

What is a big issue is that women are automatically regarded as the person to take the kids after a divorce and they're making it a huge deal.

The marches were not worse. You are mixing up two things. Racism and hooliganism. The old marches did have hooligans attacking cops, sure. But they had no white Europe banners. Words and ideas corrupt minds more than some stupid hooligan incidents.

Reactions? Yeah right. The group with the neo-Nazi banners consisted of at least 50 people, more than 10 unmasked. Yesterday, after more than two months we‚Äôve heard that the police finished their investigation and is looking for... 4 people. Nobody found yet. This is going very slow and I highly doubt the 4 will end up with any punishment. And if they do, why only 4, why do the other 46 neo-Nazis get weird immunity? Everybody from the counter demonstrations was accused of crimes. And yet here just 4 out of about 50? Well that shows what current government statistics look like. If the 4 are the ringleaders or something, than out of the leftist ObywateleRP blocking also only the leaders should be put on trial and not all of them. Even know you don‚Äôt see that there is some weird institutional immunity towards racists?

4527,"&gt;Why do people like you always have to babble on about hate?

Because your ideas are hateful. You may claim that they aren't, but the rest of your words then contradict that, you're basically saying ""I don't hate you, I just don't want you to come and share my stuff, it's mine. If you don't have your own that's tough shit for you, because I got mine"". I cannot accept such a self-centered social-darwinism approach to life. As for your cherry picked graph about demographics, other estimates suggest that global population will top out below 9 billion, so I don't have much faith in it. However even if it's true, so what? The decline of European nationalities compared to Asian and Africans is not solely due to immigration, another huge factor is falling birth rates among the younger generations. They're finding that the world their parents and grandparents have left them is less accommodating towards new parents, and it's no longer realistic to achieve a satisfactory quality of life without two parents working full time, child rearing now being more of a sacrifice, it's understandable that many choose not to, or are delaying it. However even if both of our explanations for changing demographics are equally valid, you have chosen to hang your hat on the one which demands discrimination and hate of others. 

I think fundamentally this comes down to hugely different foundational beliefs. I try not to think of the world as them and us. We're humans, and we have differences, cultural, physical, and ideological, but I feel that we're more similar than we are different, and this drives my morality. We're seeing an anti-globalism surge in many places around the world, I don't think there are any many convincingly conclusive reasons why yet as these tend to be revealed retrospectively, but it's far from certain that the right is going to take over, if anything I feel (hope) that it's just shaking the left out of it's complacency. As a proxy for the rest of the world, the American Dem's may have dropped the ball in 2016, but 2017 saw the beginnings of the backlash. Look at Marie Le'Penn's defeat, Norbert Hofer in Austria was soundly defeated, and UKIP are on the brink of collapse.

&gt;the West achieved their wealth because of free trade, cultural, technological and scientific achievements 

Like the issue above, these are some valid factors, but you've picked the ones which are less damaging to your cause; really to try and claim that European colonialism (and oppression of indigenous populations) didn't generate vast amounts of wealth and resources for the European nations through exploitation, laying the ground work for their future development and success is either ignorance or revisionism.

Tell it to the people who are being sold in Libyan slave markets. Also tell them how their society is superior to Russian in every way. US hegemony created the best world for the US and their allies at the expense of everyone else. 

&gt;This would never have happened under Russia or if Russia held an equal power position.

That we can agree upon. Disasters such as the refugee crisis, ISIS and constant wars wouldn't have happened if US power could have been challenged. 

&gt; Does that really mean we should shit on the future of our children and not defend ourselves? 

Defend ourselves? Certainly, although so far no one attacked us.

I know r/europe will support cultural and linguistic genocides in trade of so-called ""Hellens"" ""reclaiming long-lost territory"" (probably ""Hellens"" whom only spoke Turkish a few years before being settled in foreign soil)

4859,"Related but kind of Off-Topic: There's a lot of cool anecdotes/stories/battles related to the Spanish-American war that aren't very well-known.

1. The Battle of Santiago de Cuba where an old &amp; useless Spanish fleet (85% of its ammo was defective or filled with sawdust) was sent to fight/die by Admiral Cervera just to ""uphold the honor of Spain"" and protect the escape of one of the few boats worth saving: the ""Crist√≥bal Col√≥n"" (it ran out of good quality coal during its escape and was sunk by its captain, so we can say that all the deaths were pretty much useless). 

2. The gentlemanship between Spanish and American military personnel. 

-At the battle of Santiago de Cuba 
&gt;""As the ships of the U.S. fleet pushed through the carnage, rescuing as many Spanish survivors as possible, one officer was fished out by sailors of Iowa. This man proved to be Captain Don Antonio Eulate of Vizcaya. He thanked his rescuers and presented his sword to Captain Robley Evans, who handed it back as an act of chivalry.""


-Admiral Cervera with Lt Hobson 
&gt;""The entrance to Santiago harbor was not successfully blocked, as the ship was sunk near Smith Cay. Lt. Hobson and his men were captured as prisoners of war and treated by Cervera with such a degree of humanity and chivalry that, on ending the war, there was a signed memorial presented to the Admiral by members of the United States Senate and other Societies and individuals in recognition of this fact, complementing him on his outstanding conduct in the treatment of the ""Merrimac"" Captain and crew. Lt.Hobson himself for several years thereafter maintained a friendly correspondence with the old Admiral, whom he admired and respected as a consequence of his conduct.""

-This is what the Wikipedia says about the POW: 
&gt;""The Americans treated Spain‚Äôs officers, soldiers, and sailors with great respect. Ultimately, Spanish prisoners were returned to Spain with their ‚Äúhonors of war‚Äù on American ships.""

-Admiral Cervera was treated as a rockstar, local celeb during his time as a prisoner of war in Annapolis. http://www.spanamwar.com/cervera.htm
http://www.seacoastnh.com/Places-and-Events/Historic-Portsmouth/captured-spanish-admiral-cervera-takes-a-walk/

-The Battle of El Caney where General Vara del Rey died as a badass holding it for hours with 500 men until they ran out of ammo/got decimated. http://www.spanamwar.com/Elcaneysp.htm
This is the account of a US war correspondent: 
&gt;""Two Spanish soldiers in a blockhouse, and unhurt, gave themselves up to me, thinking perhaps that I was some sort of officer. I had them walk in front of me, and allowed myself a full breath only when I was once more under the cover of our own rifles. Afterward I saw one of them in the stockade at Siboney. We recognized each other simultaneously, and shook hands as old friends, across the barbed wire, genuinely glad to meet again.""
http://www.spanamwar.com/ElcaneyNorris.html

3. This one is kind of well-known in Spain and I reckon in the Philipines: The Siege of Baler. 50 soldiers holding a Church during 11 months not believing the Filipino revolutionaries that were telling them that the war was over. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Baler

4. The racism inside the US army and how the Spaniards nicknamed the black soldiers ""smoked yankees"". 

&gt;The best-known image of the Spanish-American War is that of Teddy Roosevelt on horseback charging with his Rough Riders up San Juan Hill in Cuba. But not only was the role of the Rough Riders exaggerated, it also displaced attention from the black soldiers who made up almost 25 percent of the U. S. force in Cuba. Indeed, the Spanish troops, who called the black soldiers ‚Äúsmoked Yankees,‚Äù were often more respectful of the black troops than were the white officers who commanded them. Here Sergeant-Major Frank W. Pullen, Jr. described how black soldiers almost seemed to have two enemies during the battle of El Caney and the capture of Santiago‚Äîthe Spaniards and white American soldiers.
http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/100/

Finally my two favourite ""what-ifs"":

5. Isaac Peral invented the torpedo submarine 10 years before the war. Not only was his invention dismissed by the Spanish Navy but he was also bullied out of it. Some people say it was due to the plain stupidity of his superiors and the politicians of the time others believe foreign powers and the industrial military complex of the time didn't want his invention to succeed. What would have happened if Spain had brought torpedo submarines to the Battle of Santiago de Cuba? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Peral

6. Fernando Villaamil was a Spanish Naval Officer that designed one of the first destroyer Warships in History and was really advanced to his time. He died at the stupid battle of Santiago de Cuba. He had sailed around the world and several times visited US coastal cities paying attention to the fact that most of them had no coastal batteries. He was against the passive strategy of Admiral Cervera and thought the only way to counter the superiority of the Us navy was to make diversionary attacks in US cities such as New York,Boston, Miami, Charleston.. for which he volunteered. He hoped US fleets would lift pressure out of Cuba, and American voters would pressure to stop the war if US soil was bombed. His plan was rejected. What would have happened if Cervera had accepted Villaamil's proposal and American cities were raided? Retaliatory attacks in Spanish Atlantic coastal cities?

&gt; In this post you're claiming that what they're reporting is a problem because they have an agenda, and it's a good thing that the government is stopping them by going after their funding.

I think you should reread it. I said nothing of the such nor said it was a good thing.

&gt; You claim every single major news station is a foreign-owned propaganda outlet that aims to undermine Poland and that a war against major news stations is justified.

Like I said, it's not a huge secret that most of the major media companies are foreign owned. I didn't say anything about a war, I just said it should be realized that they push an agenda.

4868,"My guess is because EU acts as a release valve, meaning that the people that are upset by what they are doing are going out on the streets protesting.

And then usually some would reach despair and start behaving violently and drag in others with them and start a snowballing effect.

That is not happening now in Romania because the people that reach despair levels just up and leave and settle in another EU country.

The problem is that no other political party is able to secure the votes of the poorer less educated folk a.k.a. the populist vote, and PSD has full reign over that using stuff like: we don't let them steal our country so they try to send us to jail (meanwhile they are stealing everything).

We need one or more political parties to be able to split the populist votes otherwise PSD will keep having alot of votes untill the dummies die.

Problem is the mayors of villages and small towns that have a heavy say in how the populist masses in their area go are persuaded to join the ruling party in order to receive funds from the goverment.

So PSD has bought into their party all the mayors from small settlements using the money from the state budget.

And guess who sends the money to the state budget? Well not PSD. Is the normal folk that pay their taxes.


I even tried and explained that to my grandparents and they reasoned: ""well looks like we will be robbed anyway might aswell be robbed by our own"" getting the older generations to switch from that mentality to the proper one which is: politicians are here to serve me and are disposable as soon as they make a wrong move is a very tough task.  

And since most of them are older they are still under the impression that the president controls everything (like in Ceau»ôescu times) and so they blame him for the shortcomings and not the actual culprit: the goverment lead and appointed by PSD.

But speaking of Ceau»ôescu times, it was all good for him back then also. Untill one day when it was not anymore and because the frustrations were so long bottled up it went from 0 to 100 in a blink of an eye.

My guess is going to be the same here: protests will die down, then they gonna think they won, we will get sanctioned by the EU and basicly end up in it just by name.

Then one of their relatives will run a child on a pedestrian crossing and get away with it and  then people will have enough and we will have a repeat of December 1989.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/7st7qc/why_is_there_no_voilence_in_romania/dt7hxmn/,cipakui,1516861572

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-namibia-genocide-lawsuit/germany-is-sued-in-u-s-over-early-1900s-namibia-slaughter-idUSKBN14P25O

&gt; The plaintiffs on Thursday sued under the Alien Tort Statute, a 1789 U.S. law often invoked in human rights cases.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Tort_Statute

&gt; The Alien Tort Statute (28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1350; ATS), also called the Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA), is a section of the United States Code that reads: ""The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States."" Since 1980, courts have interpreted this statute to allow foreign citizens to seek remedies in U.S. courts for human-rights violations for conduct committed outside the United States.

-

&gt; On April 17, 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court held that the ATS does not apply outside the United States.[38]

Hmm.  Given the recent [Supreme Court that jurisdiction is not extraterritorial](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/kiobel-v-royal-dutch-petroleum/?wpmp_switcher=desktop), I don't understand why the court even accepted the case.

The court's [opinion](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Kiobel_v_Royal_Dutch_Petroleum_Co_No_101491_2013_BL_102043_US_Apr/1?1516854795).  Doesn't sound very ambiguous.

Let me clear this up now. The main consensus post-war was that 3 million Jews and another 3 million ethnic Poles perished in the Holocaust. However, modern estimates question them and in turn leave around the same number of Jews, anywhere from 1,7 to 2 million ethnic Poles and another 500,000 to a million minorities, mainly Ukrainians and Belarussians in the east. If you actually looked at the Wikipedia article the person before me posted you'd see that's what it indeed claims as well.

In the immediate aftermath of Civil War, both Dems and Republicans tried to attract votes from blacks and whites in the South.

People weren't stupid in the 19th century. They  knew how potent campaigning on identity was.

https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/25312/if-all-fighter-jets-become-stealthy-how-will-they-fight-each-other-in-the-futur/25327#25327

&gt;Myth: WWII radars / low-frequency radars make stealth obsolete / an F-117 was shot down by an 1960s radar with simple modifications
&gt;
&gt;First, the F-117 story is untrue. The Serbs claimed they made simple modifications to their old Soviet radars, allowing them to easily spot the F-117s. But Zolt√°n Dani, the Serbian commander who shot down the F-117 in Kosovo, later admitted on national TV that he never modified the radars, merely used the lowest frequency setting. He explained that he fabricated his story for propaganda. Others alleged he did it to take [more] credit for shooting down the F-117.
&gt;
&gt;Also, NATO jamming support was unavailable the night the F-117 was shot down. Dani was aware, so he turned his radars on a third time without relocating, which allowed him to obtain the fateful radar lock.
&gt;
&gt;But more importantly (and accurately) the F-117 was shot down because of lazy mission planning by the US. The F-117 flew the same route night after night at roughly the same hours. So the Serbs moved their radars directly beneath the anticipated flight path. After a number of attempts were made over several nights, they finally got a lock at just 8 mi (13 km) when the bomb bay doors opened. The F-117 doesn't have a radar warning receiver---the pilot never knew he was directly overflying a SAM radar site (doable, but still ill-advised for any stealth fighter). He only ejected because he visually spotted the missile heading for him.
&gt;
&gt;People forget the F-117 is an old design. It entered service in 1983, just five years after the F-16 and nine years after the F-14. Back then, we didn't know how to integrate radars and other apertures into the skin without compromising its low signature.
&gt;
&gt;To be clear, a kill is a kill, and Dani deserves credit. People also forget that the Serbian forces were motivated, competent, and well-trained---measurably more so than Saddam's air defenses. The Serbs performed much better than the Iraqis and learned much from the lessons of Desert Storm.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7spylu/locals_dancing_on_the_wreckage_of_the_downed_usaf/dt7793j/,vokegaf,1516847413

Since this ape man is neither a person, nor an animal, its also borderline depiction of a Spaniard.

Let me clear this up, I 100% agree that for example when portraying U.S.A as an octopus with multiple arms, or Russia as a Bear we are trying to imply things about the political mmoves of said countries, noone is implying that their citizens are animals, something similar goes for Germany.

But in here we have a guy that is half human, dressed with alpargatas and rocking a bandoleroesque beard, and even though I get they are just trying to put cultural iberian icons on the monster to show its relation to spain, it also feels a bit too borderline to me.

&gt; But I don't see the harm trying to boost the number to 2,1 and try to promote more successful or more intelligent people to have more children by different incentives

Usually intelligent and succesfull people want fullfilling jobs. So the incentives should be to make it as easy for them as possible to combine children and career. That means enough good facilities for pre-kindergarten children. I realize that it's probably better in Finland, but in my country, it's damn impossible to put your under-3 tolder to any kind of daycare. Which is acceptable for mums who want to stay with their kids at home for a long time, but it puts of women who want to return to work relatively quickly after giving birth.

So pretty much you agree that this was horrible and illegal. You also conveniently didn't mention the settler issue. 

As for the expalsion and treatment of Turks after the independence war I agree with you it was horrible. Since you take it so far back however I will remind you that in order for the Greeks to get independent they had to fight the Ottomans for decades. You know how many towns and villages were slaughtered? And yes Greeks did reach Ankara by pillaging and burning just like the Turks had done for 400 years prior and just like they did after when they burned Izmir and killed millions. In the 1950's Turkey expelled the last remaining Greeks of Istanbul as well. 

Now the mosque issue is different. Muslims never had a presence in Athens. All current muslims are immigrants from the MENA region and the Indian subcontinent. I agree, they need a mosque but its not like they ever had one and we closed it. Turkey on the other hand has closed, destroyed or transformed churches into mosques. Churches that should have been part of your national heritage as residents of Anatolian peninsula.

Also, minor nitpick: If my understanding is correct, the NI Assembly is set up so that each party is categorised as either ""Unionist"", ""Nationalist"" **or** ""Other"". Now you're right in that up until now, it's always been the case that the largest nationalist party and largest unionist party had to govern together, but technically speaking, that's not a given.

In theory, it's just the largest parties of the two biggest blocks, including ""Other"", that have to work together, opening the door to possibilities such as an Sinn F√©in-Alliance coallition, or UUP-Greens, etc.

(SDLP-Alliance-Greens is pretty much my dream scenario, but that's probably a few decades off)

Not really.

Obviously, a list of the 15 countries with the most innovation in total would not look much like this list.  

That said, I agree that measuring total national innovation is a flawed statistic too, since it confuses sheer high population with high innovation to some extent.

5266,"&gt; Well that would only implicate that attitude is unsustainable considering their birth rates

Not necessarily, because for example Baltics score relatively high in seeing people in traditional gender norms and have relatively high birth rates (compared to European average). And on the other hand for example Germany that scores very low has a below average birth rate.

So it's clear that we cannot say that there is some clear link between people's attitudes and the birth rates. A country's birth rates is a result of many different factors, both economic and cultural. And biological too - it's just a fact that both women and men face more and more fertility-related issues.

&gt; I don't see how promoting parenthood would be a bad idea for society, maybe you do?

I just don't want the government to do any strong social engineering in either direction. I know it sounds harmless 'to promote parenthood', but the reality is that when you make something trendy and mainstream, it's usually inevitable that eventually people devitating from this standard get stigmatized.

You can see it in China for example. China nowadays faces a huge issue of having a distorded gender ratio due to decades of one-child policy. There are now tens of millions of 'surplus men' there because couples favoured having a son and often got rid of female fetuses (or even newborn female babies). And the trend in China is worsened by the fact that more and more young Chinese women living in the cities go after a good carreer, are financially independent and are putting off marriage and kids.

These women are the stigmatized by the society, because they make a bad situation (that was caused by backwards views on women in the first place) even worse. You have commercials on chinese TV like this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8g5XwN9Iho

So basically I'm just worried that this 'promotion of motherhood' will eventually turn against those who just don't fit in that. Of course we're not like China where the government holds a tight grip over the media and internet and I think it should stay that way. It's not to government's job to tell people what the family model should be. Of course the government can provide good conditions for families and thus creative incentives to have kids, but it should not manipulate the population, especially little kids in school.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/7smpoa/hubert_v√©drine_exforeign_minister_of_france_in/dt6s073/,kristynaZ,1516830851

5277,"&gt; Not as much from the standpoint of an individual country. But he's complaining about it somehow giving Germany an ""edge"" over the US, which it doesn't. It runs counter to German interests to run an artificial surplus with the US.

I think you're reading too much into this about the US. It's an article primarily about Germany. He mentions the US and Japan, but the 'swindle' is Germany vs everyone.

&gt;First, Greece and Italy do suffer from economic inefficiency here. They do hurt. But that is not a ""disadvantage"" relative to Germany. It is not to German benefit to have an artificially-high trade surplus. Germany is hurt by this as well. 

Fair enough. It's not 'disadvantage' for the country, but it is for the companies working in Greece &amp; Italy who are failing to export abroad or compete with exports from abroad because of the currency.

&gt;Second, trade equilibriums do ultimately rebalance even when that happens. There is no never-ending flow of goods from the too-weak currency country to the too-strong currency country. What will happen is that businesses in Greece will be unable to export to Germany profitably. They will lay off workers, or go out of business. There will be a glut of unemployment in Greece. They will then reform companies or rehire workers, and will offer workers lower pay. 

I agree with this, although I'd certainly call it pretty disadvantageous for Greece.. 

I'd also say that the huge loans under Target 2 will delay that rebalance. Italy is currently at [$0.5 trillion net debt](https://uk.reuters.com/article/italy-target2/italys-target-2-liabilities-hit-new-record-high-in-december-idUKL8N1P33VC), to Germany's [$1+ trillion net claim](https://www.reuters.com/article/ecb-germany/germanys-target-2-claims-hit-another-record-idUSL8N1I71KA) under the system.

5285,"&gt; Why not? I mean if governments have the right to create law, imprison criminals, maintain armed forces, build infrastructure, provide social services and so on, why would they not have the right to collect taxes?

I'm not objecting to taxation.  I'm objecting to the government giving that money away.  It may or may not be practical in the distant future to eliminate involuntary taxation and thus achieve a higher level of morality in government, but we're not there yet.

&gt; Surely it is up to society what rights a government has (and indeed what rights people have..).

I'm not so sure of that.  If that were true, then there would be no such thing as ""inalienable"" human rights.

&gt; Firstly morality is subjective so it'll depend on who you talk to whether they see something as moral or not

True.  I have a right to state my own moral beliefs though, which is what I'm doing in this thread.

&gt; taxation and wealth re-distribution isn't altruism, its a policy tool.

If government wealth-redistribution isn't in the spirit of altruism, it is morally acceptable.  If it is in the spirit of altruism, then it is morally unacceptable.

&gt; But they do so because the societies that they arise from allow it, and generally because it furthers the interests that the government perceives the society has.

If it furthers the society's interests, then it can be morally justified on that basis.  But if it's just an altruistic attempt to be nice to foreigners and not be ""Scrooge"", then it is morally reprehensible.

&gt; taxation and how that money is spent to provide services, support those that need it or on anything else is something that is the job of governments, preferably with the consent and under the supervision of society.

Indeed.  But that doesn't mean everything a government might choose to do with that power is moral.

&gt; talking about governments not having the right to tax is absurd under almost all circumstances

I'd say having your own home is quite big factor in having children everywhere, more so in Europe. And if you look at the housing prices in Sweden you'll see there's quite big financial burden on them. After all, if demand for housing increases while the people paying for that demand does not, all the while you pay for all of that housing with public funds you'll see great increase in housing prices, and in the burden projected to the people paying for it all.

But regarding financial security never stopping people having children, that's true for most parts of history because you could always secure your financial status by re-employing yourself, today it's not that simple for young people",Finland,/r/europe/comments/7smpoa/hubert_v√©drine_exforeign_minister_of_france_in/dt6jv11/,xdeft,1516823209

5394,"&gt;Or how about we don't try manipulate people into leading a life in certain way through propaganda in schools and media?

Because they're going to be affected by propaganda whether we want it or not, individuals write the school books and the media we all ingest, I don't see why promoting motherhood would be a bad thing, or discouraging people from being ""strong independent helicopters"", I'd much rather promote sharing my life with someone rather than promote brainwashing that actively makes life of the people worse.

&gt;Also I love how everytime when the topic of people not having children is brought it, someone always points out that it's women who need to change their attitudes. Because men are all eager to become daddies and it's always those pesky women denying them the chance, right?

Well as women are the sex capable of giving birth, it's kind of up to them really. I don't see how you could improve the attitudes of 'daddies' in a way it would make significant change in fertility rates, maybe you do - I'm all ears. I reckon most healthy relationships where the man sees the partner attractive and hopes for shared future, hears the suggestion of the children would take the chance.

&gt;So, let's say that you sucessfully brainwash girls into not entering work force and becoming mothers right after school - where are all those girls going to find men who are both ok with having a life-long housewife at home and who are also actually capable of supporting such a family model financially?

Well I suppose most men would love to have life-long housewifes, even brief googling would support that assumption, and I suppose most men wouldn't have problem in the attitude regarding supporting their family. But I do agree with you, supporting your family today is really hard because our societies are molded in a way, that despite declining population we're seeing incredible surge in housing prices and no real increase in wages. Now I could name many reasons for that, but first thing to stop that we obviously would need to stop so welcoming to immigrants that don't carry their own weight in our societies, because that burden is cumulative and unsustainable on any level. Of course there are many ways around this, but I think our societies should better themselves in few ways, like grant special privileges to people that fare well in school or have high IQ for example give them interest free loans that pay themselves back by having children up to x amount.

&gt;Because I don't know if you noticed, but this isn't 1950s anymore and most families can't afford to live on just one income.

5491,"&gt; trying to make up narrative

Napoleon complex is a concept about a person who is lacking in some ways (mainly height) trying to aggressively compensate for it. Literally named after Napoleon, as if what drove Napoleon was his height. Speaking of which...

The myth that Napoleon was short. A made up bit of English propaganda, which was made up because Napoleon was average height, maybe even a bit taller than average, but since French feet were longer than English, he was 5'4"" in French units, which translates to 5'7"", which was average at the time.

France is always portrayed as the aggressor in the wars, plenty of times speaking with people, mainly mentioning the fact that I am a historian that focuses on the 1789-1815 period, it's incredible how often people equate Napoleon with this despotic tyrant.

Also, aside form more mainstream popular culture, there's the depictions in popular history that affirm the narrative of Napoleon as evil.

For example, there are plenty comparisons, by many of historians, between Napoleon and Hitler, most famously by the historian Pieter Geyl in 1947, and Claude Ribbe as late as 2005. I've seen often in libraries and bookshops, in the history sections, books that make that comparison; you may not consider it those popular culture, but the fact that people who can have no real knowledge of the period have access to something like that, it really shapes the way they learn history.

It's not a made up narrative, it's experience from reading extensively about the subject, in English especially, but also in other languages. The amount of sources in English that portray Napoleon and France as aggressors, and Britain as the last defenders of Europe is incredible. Especially after World War II, because the comparisons are easy to make, but they are wrong. Hell, one of the most popular historians of British history in the 20th century, Winston Churchill himself, paints the whole period that way, and he is one of the favourite sources for the amateur historian, I speak from experience since my father loves the books.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/7sg60i/one_way_to_divide_the_british_isles/dt6cna3/,xepa105,1516816359

5495,"This is a deeply flawed study with a nonsensical methodology. It measures innovation on a sort of ""per capita"" basis, using variables like ""R&amp;D intensity"" and ""high-tech density.""  This rewards small countries with densely packed companies in patent-heavy sectors like high-tech manufacturing (South Korea) or IP (Sweden).

The study arbitrarily punishes and downgrades large countries simply because they have a more diversified range of industries.  For example, China, the U.S. and Russia are large countries rich in natural resources and thus have huge resource extraction industries, which are typically not as high-tech and high in R&amp;D costs and don't result in as many patents.  As a result, even though (say) Silicon Valley by itself generates many times more innovation than Sweden, the study ""dilutes"" that against the fact that the U.S. is also mining, harvesting, drilling, etc., and gives Sweden a higher ranking.

This sort of ""nationwide innovation per capita"" measurement is meaningless.  Worse yet, flawed studies like this lead to bad governmental policy -- for example, the U.S.'s misguided drive to turn every student of every aptitude level into a scientist, while our universities are overflowing and we have a severe shortage of welders, electricians, and skilled workers in energy industries.

Honestly the whole urbanism project has just devolved into an attempt to teach the middle classes to live with less. 

There is a strange alliance of developers seeking higher profits for a cheaper product, city officials seeking higher property taxes for the same level of badly-administered city services, and environmental eco-martyrs telling us to do more with less. They will overcrowd the cities like in the industrial revolution, people will see that the emperor has no clothes, and they‚Äôll just leave, leaving slums in their wake. 

Since the countryside now has the internet, most of what people want to learn, communicate, or shop for is no longer dependent on being in a large urban area. Work is more and more portable. And there won‚Äôt be anything to keep people living like bees in a hive. So the more we cram into the cities, the sooner they fall apart and we all leave for the sticks. 

If you want more stability we need larger, comfortable, sustainable suburbs, where people can work and shop at home. Capture rainwater, generate solar electric, and landscape sustainably. We‚Äôll all be driving electric cars in 15 years. The ‚Äúdense urban cram-in-you‚Äôll-like-it‚Äù dystopia just has no future.

Did I say they were? I said they were the largest economy in the world even prior to WW2, and that is a fact, as much as it displeases you.

Although, America could have achieved superpower status even before WW2, if not for their extremely isolationist and inward-looking mindset, which was only changed by WW2. As well as the Great Depression.

First of all, I do share that opinion, second, I'm not American.

&gt; I agree, they would still have NASA and I am sure if they put enough effort they would eventually reach moon. But surely some decades later

So you agree that they would still have NASA and reach the moon, only later. Funny, I think the same thing. So what is this debate about then?

&gt; Exactly the poor policy was the reason why a country with the greatest industrial capacity was technologically poor compared to Europe.

LOL, the European egotism on this sub, I swear... I guess you guys just can't get over the fact that America has surpassed you all, and the center of Western civilization has crossed the Atlantic.

Massive industrial capacity and technological capability are not entirely separate from each other; a country with the ""greatest industrial capacity"" as you call it, could hardly be scientifically primitive.

&gt; I'm sorry to crumble your ideals, but Americans are not where they are because they are simply great.

Don't be so pretentious, please. To be quite frank, it seems to me that you simply have personal biases against the US or Americans.

5792,"What a bullshit article.  

&gt;Oliver Ivanovic, the long-time Serb opposition leader in Kosovo, has been gunned down in northern Mitrovica.

The investigation isn't over, this might be organized crime, not related to Kosovo or Serbia.  

&gt;In Bosnia and Herzegovina‚Äôs Republika Srpska entity, meanwhile, the Milorad Dodik government has recruited the services of Russian-backed paramilitaries

Where are the sources for this? Only Bosnian papers wrote such bullshit, and never backed up any proof except some facebook and twitter pictures, but of course, the article is written by a Bosniak, so it's bias is showing.  Curiously he doesn't mention anything the FBIH is doing.  

&gt;And if we cast our memories a few months back, we will recall that Zoran Zaev, now the prime minister of Macedonia, was nearly killed in an attack on the parliament when supporters of the old VMRO-DPMNE government stormed the building last April.

And he drops *why* the storming happend in the first place.  

&gt;While there is no direct link between these events, they each nevertheless gesture at an alarming emerging reality about the Western Balkans at the dawn of a new year: violence and the threat of violence are returning to the forefront of regional political life in a way unseen since the end of the Kosovo war.

So even he says what's hes writing is not related and is bullshit.  

&gt;With the exception of the US diplomatic intervention in Macedonia last year, the West, and in particular the EU, has been watching the Balkans boil over with hardly a comment.

Why does everyone expect the EU to be a babysitter to NON members? 

&gt;Serbia, in particular, is arguably the most problematic of the bunch, with its overt drift towards one-man rule under President Aleksandar Vucic. And given his government‚Äôs latent nationalist tendencies, in the event that Belgrade were to be brought into the fold by 2025, it would almost certainly guarantee that Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Macedonia would be actively blocked in their membership aspirations by Serbia.

Ah, of course, spread fear of Serbia, professionalism it's best.  

&gt;And yet, contrary to all possible common sense, this is precisely what the EU appears to be gearing up to achieve.

I sense jelly.  

&gt;Albania may yet have a chance, if only because Edi Rama and Aleksandar Vucic are keen to play peacemakers on each other‚Äôs behalf, especially because there are no actual outstanding issues between the two countries.

Lol. Just lol. Albania didn't even start opening chapters, and they've had a headstart on both Serbia and Montenegro.  

&gt;To claim otherwise is to be wilfully naive or ignorant about the lack of substantive political and democratic reform that has taken place in any of these countries, and how brazen the respective ruling establishments have become in their illiberal plotting. Unfortunately, wilful naivet√© and ignorance are par for course as concerns the EU‚Äôs Balkan policy.

Again, let's blame the EU.  

&gt;So what should we expect in the coming months? Quite simply, the situation will become more volatile and more dangerous.

Apparently he's also a prophet. 

&gt;The true culprits behind Ivanovic‚Äôs murder are unlikely to be identified. That is, those who spent years vilifying him as an enemy of the Serb people and more generally transforming northern Kosovo into a Belgrade-administered mafia province.

Your propaganda is showing.

&gt;Milorad Dodik will continue to chip away at the legitimacy, transparency and integrity of the 2018 polls in Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to ensure that, come hell or high water, he will remain the ‚Äòglavna baja‚Äô in Banja Luka. (I have previously warned of this as well).

Man just can't be unbiased, can't he?

&gt;And depending on which direction the Macedonian name dispute heads, no one should be surprised if VMRO-DPMNE extremists again revert to violence against the new government in Skopje.

You can't pass shitty laws and expect people to sit on their hands.  

&gt;There is also a fairly high chance that Johannes Hahn and Federica Mogherini will release repeated press statements assuring us that there is ‚Äúno alternative‚Äù to the region‚Äôs European future.

Well then you shouldn't say otherwise. Sloppy arguing is another reason this discussion is toxic AF.

&gt; they are not a danger on the whole societal level because there are so few of them. If you want to cite NPD and FP√ñ election results as proof for their increase, that's wrong: People vote for those parties simply because they want less harmful immigration.

Many, but not all of them. And given the rhetoric from some of them it looks like many people have joined the far right in ways other than just protesting harmful immigration. (I protest voted them too, but I ran off as soon as the first alternative presented itself. That party is just too fucked up.)

I doubt we're going to see the dramatic reversal people keep warning about, particularly as far as gay rights are concerned, but I'm not going to rule it out as impossible. Their crazy still needs watching.

5800,"&gt; Guy that doesn't have officially have any kids wants to start a dynasty? Wuuut?

Exactly. The shit hit the proverbial fan when he acknowledged that he will adopt his two bastard sons from a relationship with his mistress. Still this came after his other authoritarian tendencies were well known. 

&gt; Also exiling him is pretty pathetic. 

Agree. I don't know what other tools they had at the time though. He could withdraw from political life, but others would have used him in the power struggle. Maybe it was for the best in the end. 

&gt; Omg he was mean to a f√©odal institution? God what evil!

If it was up to me he could have been much tougher. The Church as it was organised back then was truly a regressive institution that belonged in the Middle Ages. However, politics don't work like that. You can't upend the old order and replace it with chaos. In the end he just made a very strong enemy in the Church and its internal and external supporters and it wasn't good for him or for the country. 

&gt; The Church even owned slaves for crying out loud. (Not when Cuza came because slavery was abolished 5 years before... But not because the Church let them free by its own volition). 

Again I agree. But when slavery was abolished in the British Empire the former slave owners were compensated generously. It was a despicable but necessary action meant to promote stability. If Cuza had been less brutal and more appeasing with the Church, it might have cost him his principles but that's what statesmen do. Also it would have bought more stability for building up the country. ",European Union,/r/europe/comments/7sj08e/today_159_years_ago_the_little_union_between/dt5r2si/,this_toe_shall_pass,1516786918

Eerm, no. Only Germany admitted and paid for it. Other Euro nations haven't paid shit to the natives they killed, also the Americans who butchered natives have not done a lot in that regard tbh. Ah wait, but they had died due to diseases right? Like us saying Armenians died due to the cold, lol. 

Also, Turkey would have no problem admitting this if there was no money talk between. We are not supposed to save Armenia's broken economy, you know? As a Turkish tax payer, I do admit the genocide verbally, but I will never admit it officially, since I am aware of the intentions of Armenian government:

""Give us money! And maybe, the Eastern Turkey as well while you are at it.""

5893,"&gt;So weird to see Finns write shit like this. The open society and tolerance towards ''weirdos'' is what made your country so pleasant to be in, and it did not mean people were less patriotic

Not it wasn't. It was well-thought economic policies and the Nordic model that created us functioning public education, free public healthcare, fair justice system, labour laws... Few decades ago homosexuality was considered a disease, and back then the Finnish welfare state was already a thing.

&gt;You're the less patriotic person, who thinks your countrymen are ''degenerates'' for not fitting into a ''morality'' mold.

No, I'm talking about cultural degeneration that goes DIRECTLY against the traditional values that countries like Russia stand for. To undermine such countries. To open them up for the foreign  influences. You know, to NORMALIZE a society of which traditions and culture are broken apart so instead of a SOCIETY, they have INDIVIDUALS who are taught strive for themselves and the machine around them (instead for their fellow people). Be like this! Buy this! Buy that! Be yourself! Be beautiful! Individuals in this kind of society are weak and easily manipulated.

&gt;Also fuck off with the ''openly patriotic'' bullshit. Russian patriotism has led to countless deaths in Eastern Europe in the last two decades. 

It's not Russian patriotism that attacked to Ukraine. It was the geopolitical interests of the Russian state in order to keep Russia secured. Why would they think about the interests of the US and NATO over their own? Ever since the end of the Cold War, NATO had expanded eastwards and Russia had warned many times for them not to meddle with Ukraine. However, they did, and after the revolution, it was obvious for Russia that NATO will also expand to Ukraine and thus took Crimea. Any country the size of Russia would do that. Blaming patriotism is just a distraction. 

&gt;I'd rather have ''degenerates'' who push cultural boundries than ''patriots'' who push borders and kill people.

When those cultural boundaries destroy your cultural identity and traditional values while driving the interests of someone else than your people, I think it's pretty reasonable to oppose it. But of course, that's not what they want you to think, so the official truth is that it's a good thing and many people have unfortunately swallowed the bait.

However, then again, everything is relative. What China has achieved in their country, and what their the CCP has achieved for their people, as far as I am concerned, only folks from places like the MENA region, South American region, Sub Indian continent and African region can only dream of. 

The CCP, as harsh as they are, did transform for a vast portion of the country and vast portion of their people from facing starvation to able to afford food and a really of a proper life. I mean, you don't hear of the slum problems in China like in India or Brazil, or a sectarian strife like in the Middle East, starvation issues in Africa. 

Simply put, the CCP did such a good job that you don't see Chinese refugees piling on boats trying to get into the West of Australia.

As for their elites, again I must say in China, the CCP rules all. The rich don't run the CCP like in the US, Russia and some countries in Europe. The CCP runs them. That is the difference.

Well, unless you advocate Europe stunting itself there is not much you could do against China really.
