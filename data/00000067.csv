0,"&gt; But you won't be contact with them, unlike with a vaccine. It doesn't make sense to compare the two. 

Finding a difference between two scenarios doesn't mean that it doesn't make sense to compare the two. If there were no differences, it would be the same scenario.

&gt;When it comes to tigers in a cage you evaluate the safety of the cage, not the tigers.

Does: ""when it comes to being injected with government approved vaccines, you are evaluating the safety of the testing protocols, not the vaccines"" sound convincing? 

&gt;Does ""safe"" mean to you ""100% perfect, cannot harm anyone ever""? 

Nothing falls into ""100% perfect, cannot harm anyone ever"", but some things fall into the category of: ""powerful things that can do a lot of harm and are not doing harm while lots of people do their jobs right?"" - tigers, vaccines, nuclear reactors. Would you be willing to ""strongly agree"" these things are safe? Maybe you would. But hopefully you can sympathize with somebody who would only answer ""mostly agree"" (while at the same time thinking these things are good and worth the risk in practice.)

&gt;OP linked to the study. They addressed that point.

Did they? I didn't read it carefully for more than a couple of pages and only found this bit:

&gt; Responses to the three statements were answered on Likert scales ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”. Likert responses presented to respondents differed between surveys (appendix 1 p 4); however, the outermost categories (“strongly agree” and “strongly disagree”) remained consistent across surveys. Thus, to allow meaningful comparisons in trends between surveys, individual survey responses falling between “strongly agree” and “strongly disagree” were recoded into the new category “neither strongly agree nor strongly disagree”, with the “strongly agree” and “strongly disagree” responses remaining unchanged. This reclassification assumes that respondents who report the most confident (“strongly agree”) and least confident (“strongly disagree”) beliefs are unlikely to change their response regardless of whether they are presented with additional Likert categories such as “tend to agree”, “somewhat agree”, or “neither agree nor disagree” (or a combination thereof; appendix 1 p 4). 

This makes it clear why they did what they did (to aggregate data) but the issue is - only graphing ""strong agreers"" makes it look like people are more worried than they are, when it would be more representative to graph together those who agree strongly and agree mostly (which can't be done with this recoded data.)",,/r/europe/comments/iysbxq/vaccines_in_europe/g6es7vt/,HamCustodian,1600943616

Secondly, modern Greeks don’t claim 100% genetically being descended by ancients geeks, but the language, customs are there. Also the records exist of how christianity replaced the Olympians (see apostle Paul) so there is an evolution of sorts of how ancient Greeks slowly turned into modern ones. It was not a totally new group of people that came, conquered the Greeks living here, and assimilated them.

But lastly, even though I say I find it far fetched, my point is “what if Bulgarians decided to change their name to Thrace, their language to thracians, and claimed to be the true descendants of Thrace”.

When Covid-19 struck Europe, Lombardy’s flooded hospitals and spiralling death toll provided a grim template for Italy’s neighbours. In the past weeks, however, it is offering a more upbeat, alternative path: while Spain, France and the UK are experiencing a second surge in infections after loosening lockdown restrictions, Italy has kept the disease under control.  New daily cases are on the rise to 1,535 from the low hundreds in June, when restrictions started easing. But this compares with more than 10,000 new cases in Spain and France. Life feels normal in most of Italy: restaurants and bars are open, people enjoy late-summer trips to the beach and children have returned to school.","Kennst du das Land, wo die Zitronen blühn",/r/europe/comments/iyusts/italys_harsh_lessons_help_keep_second_wave_at_bay/g6esg8t/,standy85,1600943834

36,"You and the Zionists have different definitions of what constitutes historic Palestine and the entitlements of its denizens to it. Starting off with the borders themselves - they changed frequently depending on which space the ruling empires allocated to it, and although minor, still quite significant relative to the size of the land.

What exactly is the Palestinian nation ought to be? Judean borders? Syria Palaestina? Byzantine Palaestina Prima, Palaestina II, Palaestina Salutoris, all of them? Jund Filastin borders? British mandate borders? Arab Palestinian leadership claimed the right to the latter, which is actually a bit larger than the Ottoman Jund Filastin borders and spans over the Negev ( traditionally inhabited by nomadic Bedouins ) and Acre, Tiberias ( A majority Jewish city at that time and long before ) and other territorial gains.

Ironically, by claiming sovereign rights over Mandatory borders, which were carved out by the British, you and they legitimize British Imperial authority to assign lands as they see fit, while modern Palestinian leadership claims to reject all British legitimacy over Historic Palestine, yet still insisting on an inherent right for the Negev and Northern additions to be part of their future state.


Which brings us to the second point by which you believe, emphasis on believe, that because a demographic happens to own private property in a territory, they are automatically entitled to have *sovereignty* over any nearby public land. I.E, if 10 Arabs own farmhouses near a forest or desert, that forest or desert also 'belongs' to them.

Now in the Palestinian case, unlike Native American chiefdoms or Aborigine communes or the Indian kingdoms or any other example, those public lands were *not* ruled by them at the time, nor have they *ever* been. Sovereignty was always exercised from somewhere else.  So while you think that they *should* exclusively control it by virtue of living nearby, the Zionists think that sovereignty should be transferred from the current sovereign or restored to the last native sovereign status.

Finally, the claim that Zionism needs to ""completely transform"" the culture, language and lifestyle of Historic Palestine is demomstrably falsd and serves to highlight why private ownership and Sovereignty should be distinguished - first, under the partition plan, 50% of so-called 'historic' British Palestine becomes an Arab nation-state.  Meanwhile Israel itself would have many more Arab citizens than there even are today, and of those who still remain today, they still speak Arabic, practice a similar lifestyle in their cities, are culturally homogenous, etc etc.

There have been higher rates of westernization, and changes, and challenges, but plenty of traditionally Arab areas exist exactly as they did under the Mandate - they just answer to the Israeli government instead of the British deputy. So to suggest all of those things would be 'completely' transformed is mistaken.

&gt;You literally blame others for doing the precise thing you yourself would do without even thinking twice about it.

I have no idea what you are specifically referring to anymore, but the formation of Israel was much more complicated than 'preserving identity and culture'. In a perfect world, native Judeans wouldve never been exiled into a diaspora, but they were. In a perfect world, they could 'let bygones be bygones' and start a new life, which was attempted for 2000 years, but at the turn of the 20th century that was still unattained and Zionism sprung in reaction to Europeans who kept saying it would be best for Jews to 'go back where they came from' and live in their own ancestral nation instead of being a minority in 'other' nations.

In a perfect world, nobody would have a reason to oppose the Palestinian-Arab desire of Arab hegemony over that land, and in a perfect world Jewish refugees would be able to resettle in and restore the former status of the Jewish state. Unfortunately, those two goals are mutually exclusive, and so it must be pointed out that Arab-Palestinian sovereignty on a territory which they never ruled and which was conquered from native rulers is a matter of debate.

&gt;Reminds me of Jews who think europeans wanting to preserve their culture from foreigners are nazis while blindly supporting their own ethnostate without criticism.

I'm sure hypocrites exist across all fields and identity groups, outside politics as well. I'm also aware that the phenomena you just described hyperbolically is just one segment of a much wider spectrum of thought. In terms of the precise definitions of what 'cultural preservation' and 'without criticism' entails. The percentage of the caricaturized far-left European Jew, who is also an uncritical suppprter of right-wing Israeli ideology at the same time is not very high, even if they are popularized exactly for the sake of controversy and outrage from Alt-Righters.",Israel,/r/europe/comments/ixeo1q/leaks_show_chelsea_owner_abramovich_funded/g6esjqn/,Pingerim,1600943927

US having detention centres is not also due to that, and I was referring to cages and horrible detention centres not some arbitrary centres. I'm also not bringing the history in here believe me, but I'm not sure if you want to debate on nation building processes of Europe and the US, but yeah, you guys do have a settler country that was determined to expand in the expanse of genociding natives and taking over Mexican lands so yeah you do have different nation concepts and citizenship concept to some European countries. I'm not sure how that's related but anyway. Your immigration issues are also due to US destabilising and continuing repression in the countries at south of its, and done massive damages within the last century. So, meh indeed. Yet again, that's not about left or right. A right winger can be for open borders while left wing was traditionally partially anti immigrant or for controlled immigration even.

Now, your country is with a political culture and main parties both are massively against a normative social welfare state, anti-tax, against anything minimally about wealth redistribution or any normal structures. It is also imperialistic, agressive, even pro-torture, inherently religious, populist, and bla.

In the years from 1912 to 1926 the USA had **over 5,000 deaths per year** caused by Measles. Not to speak of the number of long term damages to brain and body for those who survived. 

*"" Measles is a highly contagious viral infection that frequently causes a severe flu-like illness accompanied by a rash. Complications occur in 3 in 10 who get measles and young children are especially vulnerable.1 Ear infections and diarrhea are most common, but 1 in 20 will get pneumonia; 1 in 1,000 will have brain swelling that can cause deafness and intellectual disability; and 1 or 2 in 1,000 will die.1 Before the vaccine was available in 1963, nearly every child got measles by age 15.2 The disease sickened 3 to 4 million people and led to about 500 deaths and 48,000 hospitalizations every year ""* [Source](https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/myths-and-facts/)

Compared to that, the MMR vaccine can only cause severe damage to humans that are already immune compromised and hence should not be vaccined at all. Some of these people (babies, toddlers) died because the records were wrong or the compromised immune system has not been detected before the vaccine. Since 1967 these cases average at **4 per year**. [Source](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html)",,/r/europe/comments/iysbxq/vaccines_in_europe/g6ekeh6/,Madouc,1600936856

Because DB is a publically traded company. A company with a flying competition on intra German city travel. If you would take away that competition they would simply raise the prices or lower the quality. 

It's like having two restaurants in town and making one of them raise prices. The other one will follow suit or just lower the quality of the food. What you gonna do? Not eat?

No, they don't. I don't know in which bubble you live in, but the **vast majority** of Europeans don't understand English, especially not in the most populated countries.

Now that Britain is out of the picture, the only place where « everyone understands English » would be, well, English-speaking social media and the young upper middle-class that congregates there.

To had my personal sentiment, assuming that English is the default language of Europe as a civilization is frankly an insult to the great cultures that populate this continent and does nothing else that put us under the cultural purview of the US.

&gt;Complete non-sequitur

I'm guessing you Latin isn't too good. I've made a perfectly sound argument.

Making a display appealing to sentiment outside of Poland, within a specific demographic under the assumption that it would trigger support absolutely looks like the trappings of organized ideology rather than grassroots social change and it **will** be interpreted that way by the political movements within Poland hostile to the publicity of homosexuality and so on.

&gt;Anthropologically, Macedonians possess genetic lineages postulated to represent Balkan prehistoric and historic demographic processes.[77] Such lineages are also typically found in other South Slavs, especially Bulgarians, Serbs, Bosniaks and Montenegrins, but also in Greeks and Romanians.[b] Y-DNA studies suggest that Macedonians along with neighboring South Slavs are distinct from other Slavic-speaking populations in Europe and a majority of their Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups are likely to be inherited from inhabitants of the Balkans that predated sixth-century Slavic migrations.[86] [...] Genetic similarity, irrespective of language and ethnicity, has a strong correspondence to geographic proximity in European populations.[84][85][92] In regard to population genetics, not all regions of Southeastern Europe had the same ratio of native Byzantine and invading Slavic population, with the territory of the Eastern Balkans (Macedonia, Thrace and Moesia) having a higher percentages of locals compared to Slavs. Considering the majority of the Balkan Slavs came via the Eastern Carpathian route, lower percentage on east does not imply that the number of the Slavs there was lesser than among the Western South Slavs. Most probably on the territory of Western South Slavs was a state of desolation which produced there a founder effect.[93][94]

When talking about the environment, the tune usually goes something like: ""if we stop using coal, if we stop eating meat, if we stop using cars, if we all recycle, if we get China to be sensible, if we get India to cooperate, if we get the USA to limit their consumption habits, if we get Brazil to stop murdering its own forests, if we get to do all of these completely unrealistic things plus a dozen more, *then maybe, just maybe, in the next 100 years the global temperature will rise by 2 °C instead of 4!*"".

383,"Does Hydrogen show a tendency to diffuse? Yes very easily. During ammonia production it actually reacted with the early designs of the pressure tank. Taking the carbon out of the steel it was made up of. This caused them to become brittle and eventually break. Due to its size and little interaction between molecules, hydrogen is one of the most volatile and hard to control gasses that exist. 

That being said there are ways around this. Liquid hydrogen for one, or different containers. you will not be able to use normal fuselage but with modifications it is possible without leakage or with controlled leakage. Ie having it react at catalytic sites immediately before being able to combust. 

So the statement that hydrogen is volatile I agree with. The statement that this means the end for its use as a fuel I cannot agree with. Especially because we are talking about concepts here.

496,"International healthcare companies are struggling to reclaim around $2.3bn in debts owed to them by Turkey’s state hospitals, a senior US official has revealed, as he warned of the dangers posed to the Turkish economy by an unpredictable investment environment.

**David Satterfield, the American ambassador to Ankara, said that the non-payment of money owed to pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies from the US and elsewhere had become a “significant issue”** in trade relations between his country and Turkey.

Mr Satterfield said that US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross had last year been given assurances by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his son-in-law, finance minister Berat Albayrak, that the outstanding dues — at the time totalling $230m — would be paid.

One year on, he said the Turkish government had asked the companies to accept “a range of very significant reductions in the amount owed”, a sum he said had now snowballed to $2.3bn.

**“There will be consequences to non-payment of debt or to demands that companies accept a reduction in the total for equipment and services provided,” Mr Satterfield warned** during an online event hosted by the American-Turkish Council, a business group.

“Companies will consider departing the Turkish market or will reduce their exposure to the Turkish market. This is not a direction that serves the interests of Turkey, its business persons or its citizens and it needs to be addressed and addressed promptly.”

Mr Satterfield’s comments will deliver a blow to Turkish policymakers at a time when they are already struggling to attract foreign investment.

New entrants to the Turkish market have been increasingly deterred in recent years by concerns about economic policy under the watch of Mr Erdogan, as well as the erosion of the rule of law and geopolitical risks caused by Ankara’s tense relations with Europe and the US. 

Volkswagen had been close to finalising an agreement to build a new car plant in Turkey last year but put the plan on hold after Mr Erdogan ordered a military operation against US-backed Kurdish forces in north-eastern Syria that provoked outrage in Europe. Earlier this year, VW confirmed it would axe the plan amid plummeting demand in the auto sector as a result of the coronavirus crisis.

Healthcare reform has been one of the most successful features of Mr Erdogan’s 18 years at the helm. The government has poured money into building hospitals and overhauled social security provisions — policies that have won widespread public approval and been a driver of successive election victories by the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP). 

In recent years, however, the government has pursued a more controversial policy of building giant hospitals in cities across Turkey under a public-private partnership model that has left the government with large financial liabilities. 

Late payment of debts was a common complaint among Turkish companies that were suppliers to the government in the aftermath of a 2018 currency crisis that wiped almost 30 per cent off the value of the lira and precipitated a recession.

It has once again reared its head since the onset of the pandemic, which has been accompanied by a fresh plunge in the currency. The president of the Federation of Medical Device Manufacturers and Suppliers told the Turkish news site Duvar earlier this month that companies in his sector were owned TL17bn ($2.2bn) by the state. 

Still, Turkish officials have always insisted their country has an impeccable record on its obligations to foreign investors and businesses. Turkey has never defaulted on its sovereign debt in its 97-year history as a republic.
Turkey’s low levels of government debt and its small budget deficit were long seen as one of its strengths. They remain low in comparison to some other emerging markets. However, the rating agency Moody’s cited the government’s deteriorating fiscal position as one the factors behind its decision to cut the debt rating deeper into junk territory this month.

The Turkish Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",Lake Bled connoisseur,/r/europe/comments/iypyzv/us_warns_turkey_over_failure_to_pay_foreign/g6dz6sp/,MelodicBerries,1600920037

519,"I said Prussia's militarism was bad, not the whole state. And this term was not invented by the allies or only used by other countries. During the Weimar Republic Konrad Adenauer for example called Prussia the ""evil spirit of Europe"" and partly blamed it's militarism for the outbreak of WWI. 

And while Prussia and the German Empire were a model state in many aspects their deep-rooted militarism and ideas of more or less blind obedience to your superiors are not just harmful, they are deeply undemocratic and have nothing to offer to modern Germany.

I blame this on Wilhelm II. and his aggressive imperialism though, since Bismarck actually wanted a Germany that kept within it's own borders. He wanted the German Empire to be a powerful but peaceful giant in the middle of Europe. 

And yes, french militarism is bad too but so is militarism in general, right now especially in America and Russia.

551,"&gt;UK still beats the EU on that list

It beats about half the EU. It's much more similar to the EU than the US. But my main point was about the USA. 

There's no such thing as ""the best place to live in the world"" when you start comparing the best of the best. Each place has its strengths and weaknesses. I'm just saying the US isn't even on the list of places to compare to and the EU is. I can't say whether its better to live in Japan or the EU(workers rights tells me EU, technology-wise maybe Japan). I can say that the US isn't worthy of comparison to those two yet. 

&gt;""culturally inferior"" (fucking lol)

[Here](http://www.muturzikin.com/carteseurope/europe.htm) is a dialect/language map of Europe and [here](http://www.muturzikin.com/cartesusa/usa.htm) is a dialect/language map of the USA. As you can see, the only real diversity in the US comes from Indian reservations: people which we did a pretty good job of wiping out and replacing with vast swaths of blue. 

The same is true for architecture. European architecture varies greatly even within the same region while pretty much everywhere in the US looks the same. Likewise for food, local cultural traditions, attitudes, humor...almost every facet of culture is more diverse in Europe. 


It's really difficult to explain the difference in words so I might to something a little unscientific here and try to show you what I mean because a picture or a gut feeling can say a thousand words. I chose a random street view spot in both Jackson, MS and Porto Portugal, 2 of the most important cities in each region. I won't make any value judgments: you can decide where you'd rather want to live.

Poles got Silesia, Pomerania and Posen, and the Russians got Koenigsberg as a warm water port.

A reason a ruling will see a reduction in Greeks claims. How much is up to the judges. But Kastellorizo is only a 20.000 Inhabitant Island compared to Turkey Coast. If the court will follow and previous ruling in those regards, we will see Kastellorizo influence be below 50% and less. I can recommend reading some more rulings to understand what the issues is with Greeks claim.

Yes the Turkish claims have issues that they are regarding nearly nothing from the International law and especially UNCLOS. Saying those are bollocks you only need a working mind. But there is still the conflict, even if Turkey would take international law more seriously and their claims after international law wouldn't be small. Their halfway **claim** would be for the Eastern med pretty realistic (Not Cyprus part) in regards to being a **claim**.


Keeping those rulings in mind. I think finding a treaty between Turkey and Greece would benefit Greece more, than a court ruling.
Greece government isn't stupid played quite until now. Except the Greek-Egypt Deal before the arbitration, it's mostly being the appeasing power. While Turkey pretty much isolated itself. Turkey also run it's economy into the Ground with Corona hitting it even harder. EU payment are frozen due various Reason and due to the Cyprus issues Sanction are on the table. All Eastern Med countries are on Greece side(except of half of Lybia) and the EU is backing it.

It has the far stronger negotiation position. Erdogan and his party need a win his support is unsure and Turkey needs money or international investment to utilize those Gasfields anyway.

632,"The author makes a bunch of assumptions and a stretched scenario to support his conclusion. It's a pity, because he almost had it. 

&gt;Key characteristics ideal for CAS include efficient fuel use (loiter time)

Yes, in a very specific scenario of a low intensity conflict/policing, where you'd for example go on a patrol from point A to point B and somewhere along the way there might be an ambush, or not. 

In a high intensity conflict though you wouldn't loiter much because A) the enemy shoots back, B) it's a target rich environment where you'd expect to expend munitions quickly and go back.

&gt;low and slow flying (target discrimination and acquisition)

Not really, they have some really powerful sensors these days (used by A-10s as well).

The US offsets the bulk of their firepower into air, and as such inter service cooperation is a must. I trust they'll solve the problem of how to get the pilots on target, as they did so far.

&gt; and rough landing strip capability (close to the fight).

It's not about physical proximity, but about the ability to react quickly. I don't remember A-10s ever operating on anything but proper airstrips either. Harriers did.


&gt;CAS is a mission, not a plane

&gt;Ground troops generally believe only a purpose-built CAS aircraft with full-time CAS pilots can correct erroneous requests from troops under fire, identify changes to ground maneuver without notification, or carry sufficient ammunition to provide repeated “gun runs” when the enemy “hugs” friendly units in an effort to evade bombing.

So close.

The A-10s excel at CAS because that's pretty much all that they do. No shit that they're going to be better than a random fighter jock that trains for a wide variety of other missions a most likely doesn't like CAS that much.

Talking to a couple of US officers on the topic, the consensus seems to be that the problem here is cultural and educational. 

US Air force pilots, save for the A-10 guys do not understand ground war, and do not give a shit. They don't understand tactics, and as such they cannot predict or recognize maneuver or developments on the ground. 

They are unable to identify friendly vehicles or formations, because they simply don't know how they look like. Apparently, during the Gulf War, they often times identified enemies by gun barrel orientation. 

They want to come in, drop a bomb on something, and go home. One of the aforementioned officers (a fellow armor guy) told me a story where he basically had to plead with the pilot not to drop on them because he incorrectly identified their own position as the enemy and was eager to bomb something. 

In contrast, all of them praise the Army Aviation and the Navy/Marines as having a completely different mindset when it comes to CAS.

Take an F-35 squadron and have them do CAS only, and then we can talk about inherent advantages and disadvantages of the platform. Until then, it's apples and oranges.

Nobody on the ground gives a shit how far the CAS aircraft is, how high it is, how fast it is. What they care is for the pilot to be able to comprehend the situation, react to commands and developments on the ground, and do that quickly and accurately.",,/r/europe/comments/iyc7cy/risk_of_thunderstorms_prevented_dutch_f35s_from/g6d5wj8/,According_Machine_38,1600900865

That means phasing out fossil fuel as fast as possible starting now, and the sooner we'll have applications ready for hydrogen consumption, the better. In this grand scheme I believe that consumer prices are just a small parameter that will fluctuate a lot for some time, but anyway, we have no choice but to move forward.

660,"&gt; A reason I called them extreme. Greece claims are the maximun claims that could been made

Those so called ""maximum"" claims are those that can be made under international law. So, you know, the normal stuff that every self-respecting country does. You can check up EU's version and you'll see that the EU agrees -google Seville's map. What you actually meant to say was that *Turkey* has **maximalist** claims. You know, those that they accuse Greece of having to draw attention away from their own.

You've read way too much Turkish propaganda if you think in terms of coastline like that. This is an archipelago we are talking about, and as a matter of fact, it is the sea that created the name archipelago itself. A sea full of small pieces of earth, surrounded by water in all sides. Make a guess about how that translates to *coastline length*. And Kastellorizo is not going to be the exception -it's not as if it lies five thousand kilometers away, it's a two cities distance away from Rhodes. 

I've seen the Turkish propaganda before, and while I realized why they were saying the things that they were saying, you are the very first fully fledged victim that I've seen in the wild. Congratulations on not analyzing what you are reading. 

A final note; This is Greece's backyard. Any deal is a bad deal because Greece would give something that they have in return for nothing. It doesn't even matter how much they give -what matters is that Turkey is yelling without any right, and the world is appeasing it.

The population was ill equipped to understand how the EU worked and their politicians and right wing media has played their parts over decades to make EU the 'go to blame' for all their political and economic problems. When the Brexit result finally surfaced, the shocked politicians instead of looking inward and blaming themselves and their media for how they painted the EU for decades decided to turn to the classic 'Russian influence'.

We have seen this play out over and over again, in the U.S elections among others. It's not a couple of tweets or Facebook post that sways a population en mass, it's the systemic problems at home that are being ignored, the majority's concerns on immigration, the economy and excessive leftism that among other things.

Point regarding Bavaria, Baden and Württemberg stands as those were southern German states and joined unitied Germany on theirs' own accord, not in result of lost war like Saxony and Hesse-Darmstadt did. 

Unification would not be possible without a war since Habsburgs and Hohenzollerns would never reach a compromise and in most scenarios foreign powers like Russia or France would more than likely try to intervene to prevent such unification.

&gt;Austria would not have to give up it's parts outside the HRE, remember the crown of prussia was outside the HRE as well. The habsburgs just didn't want to accept a protestant emperor.

Fairly bad comparison since while most Prussia was part of German Confederation (reminder that HRE doesn't exist already for 60 years by 1860s...) and in general was an ethnic german state, Austria empire was overwhelmingly non-german and had vast bulk of it's imperial possessions outside the Confederation. Austrian Empire was made only in over 20% of ethnic Germans, Kingdom of Prussia meanwhile was up to 80% german. Habsburgs would never accept an emperor over them **when they already had imperial crown of their own**. Religion here played secondary if not tertiary role.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  On 29 June 1939, following a [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum), Hatay became a Turkish province. This referendum has been labelled both ""phoney"" and ""rigged"", and a way for the French to let Turks take over the area, hoping that they would turn on Hitler.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatay_Province#cite_note-JackKalpakian-9)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatay_Province#cite_note-10) For the referendum, Turkey moved tens of thousands of Turks into Alexandretta to vote.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatay_Province#cite_note-RobertFisk-11) These were Turks born in Hatay who were now living elsewhere in Turkey. In two government communiqués in 1937 and 1938, the Turkish government asked all local government authorities to make lists of their employees originally from Hatay. Those listed were then sent to Hatay to register as citizens and vote.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatay_Province#cite_note-12)

865,"I have a few issues about this ""cattle are worse for climate than cars"".

I can buy that the machinery that is used in modern farming releases a lot of carbon dioxide.

However as for the animal themselves their contribution did not start from zero like the cars did, go back a hundred years and there were plenty of cattle that produced methane, and in Europe we had a lot more goats and sheeps than we have today + more horses and wild animals that also produced methane.

And the methane they produce is not from a fossil origin, and it has a has half life of 9.1 year in the atmosphere. And when it goes back to being carbon dioxide again it doesn't add the atmospheric carbon dioxide like that of fossil origin does - it is part of the carbon cycle.

881,"Refugees are not economic migrants. They are people facing hardships we cannot even imagine and were forced to flee. They flew first in the neighbouring countries (like Turkey, Lebanon or Jordan, which took millions of Syrian refugees overall, the vast majority). But you cannot expect these countries to be able to handle such crazy amounts of new people in their economy in such a short amount of time. And you cannot expect Italy and Greece to do the same. And I **do not** expect Czech Republic to be able to handle such high amounts of refugees either on its own.

But I do expect Czech Republic to take more than 2000  refugees (2019 numbers according to worldbank). I expect it for these disadvantage people, which are not economic migrants. And I expect it for your fellow EU countries on the Mediterranean, who have reached their limit.

Finally, the economic argument makes absolutely no sense, other than being the most selfish thing I have read in a while. It does not make sense because countries get EU funds for hosting refugees (and Italy is a net contributor, and Greece has a GDP per capita lower than yours). It also does not make sense because Czech Republic, as mentioned, has developed immensely thanks to the EU (doubled the GDP per capita alone), and can certainly handle a few thousands extra **refugees**.

But, if you insist that your country does not want to take neither asylum seekers, economic migrants, or refugees alike, then you should help countries like Italy, Greece, and Spain both economically and logistically at the very least, the same way your country was helped in the past. Like, it is the bare minimum threshold of what you should be doing, without even being asked (and it is what the Commission proposed in 2018 and the Visegrád group [categorically opposed](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-budget-funds/eu-proposes-more-spending-on-italy-and-south-less-in-east-idUSKCN1IU1RB)).

That comparison would make sense, if the academy of nutrition and dietetics would be a vegan organisation, which they are not.

Do you also think all these other associations individually have came to the wrong conclusion?  

[**Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27886704/)

· *It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that appropriately planned vegetarian, including vegan, diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. These diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, adolescence, older adulthood, and for athletes.*

[**Dietitians of Canada**](https://www.dietitians.ca/Downloads/Factsheets/Guidlines-for-Vegans.aspx)

· *A healthy vegan diet can meet all your nutrient needs at any stage of life including when you are pregnant, breastfeeding or for older adults.*

[**The British National Health Service**](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)

· *With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.*

[**The British Nutrition Foundation**](https://www.nutrition.org.uk/bnf-publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)

· *A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.*

[**The Dietitians Association of Australia**](https://daa.asn.au/smart-eating-for-you/smart-eating-fast-facts/healthy-eating/vegan-diets-facts-tips-and-considerations/)

· *Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. With good planning, those following a vegan diet can cover all their nutrient bases, but there are some extra things to consider.*

[**The United States Department of Agriculture**](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/tips-vegetarians)

· *Vegetarian diets (see context) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.*

[**The National Health and Medical Research Council**](https://nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/australian-dietary-guidelines)

· *Appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthy and nutritionally adequate. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the lifecycle. Those following a strict vegetarian or vegan diet can meet nutrient requirements as long as energy needs are met and an appropriate variety of plant foods are eaten throughout the day*

[**The Mayo Clinic**](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)

· *A well-planned vegetarian diet (see context) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.*

[**The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada**](https://www.heartandstroke.ca/get-healthy/healthy-eating/specific-diets/for-vegetarians)

· *Vegetarian diets (see context) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits.*

[**Harvard Medical School**](http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/becoming-a-vegetarian)

· *Traditionally, research into vegetarianism focused mainly on potential nutritional deficiencies, but in recent years, the pendulum has swung the other way, and studies are confirming the health benefits of meat-free eating. Nowadays, plant-based eating is recognized as not only nutritionally sufficient but also as a way to reduce the risk for many chronic illnesses.*

[**British Dietetic Association**](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/vegetarianfoodfacts.pdf)

· *Well planned vegetarian diets (see context) can be nutritious and healthy. They are associated with lower risks of heart disease, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain cancers and lower cholesterol levels. This could be because such diets are lower in saturated fat, contain fewer calories and more fiber and phytonutrients/phytochemicals (these can have protective properties) than non-vegetarian diets.

&gt;Yeah, maybe. But Germany has a completely different history and culture. I think at the end of the day what needs to change in Italy is the way we do things.

Does it? Germany was mostly authoritarian until post war era. Their good political culture is a reflection of a good political structure. 

&gt;Wasteful? What I find wasteful is paying millions of people who retired with amazing pensions while the younger generation are left to hang dry. What are we really saving right now? A few millions a year to be optimistic, when we have billions and billions of expenses in the budget and ZERO proper investments. What I find wasteful is that we're even wasting time and money on this referendum instead of focusing on structural reforms and investments to get our country back on track.

I'm just saying it doesn't make sense to have two houses that serve the same role. The upper house should represent regions. That would solve a lot of the problems.",Canada,/r/europe/comments/ixkm8s/italians_vote_to_slash_size_of_parliament_by_a/g6c0az7/,Kallipoliz,1600879606

1030,"By saying that turkey pulled itself out, it’s like you’re implying they did it willingly. As far as I remember relations between Israel and turkey started deteriorating, that why Cyprus/Greece became their next option (which I read is more expensive). So yeah I get what you say, it turkeys own actions that caused it, but still I keep reading a lot of Turks arguing “why weren’t we called for discussions in the east med.”

The islands may or may not have a special ruling. Kastellorizo’s case may be different, but I don’t see a point in having a special ruling for islands. No special ruling was made for Corsica or Sardinia. The same rules apply for all EEZ: it’s between states to figure it out. Whether UNCLOS or another for of agreement, it’s up to them. Turkey wants minimal EEZ, Greece wants full EEZ, it’s up to them to decide. However (kastellorizo aside) I’m calling it absurd to have turkey EEZ in between two or more Greek islands. Imagine the sea in Bosporus, between the two Turkish shores, be given to Greece’s EEZ (even if geography allowed it). Wouldn’t it be super weird? That’s what I’m saying. Look at the map (I mean the blue homeland absurdities) and try to explain logically how Turkish EEZ can possibly infiltrate the Aegean between Greek populated islands. 

Lastly, I’m not hear you condemn their claims. Anyone’s claims. It’s just that: claims. Greece claims full island EEZ, turkey claims no island EEZ, because they know that in the end the decision will be somewhere in between. When claims turn to actions, that’s when it bothers me. Greece and Egypt deliminated their water, leaving kastellorizo aside (to be agreed afterwards once the delimitation with turkey concludes) and I think that’s ok. Turkey’s and Libya’s disregarding Greek islands and sending it to the UN was an action that for me was provocative. As was the warships.

As you say, it’s complicated and I really hope this EU summit will lead to real discussions.",,/r/europe/comments/ixqwxp/turkey_greece_agree_to_resume_talks_to_resolve/g6bkrna/,4L3X4NDR0S,1600871868

You cannot overthrow a conqueror/tyrrant (like French and US Revolution) without blood ,innocent or not, being spilled. The hatred against Ottomans (see Orlov revolt and subsequent ottoman suppression in Tripoli on Holy Monday, 29 March 1770) and their collaborators was immense especially during first year of Rebellion so everyone who was unfortunate to be with the Ottomans met their death. Back then, such practices of looting, pillaging and executing enemies, armed or not, was something of a norm. Countless events during 18th, 19th and 20th century show that in War soldiers, regulars but especially irregulars (such as greek revolutionaries) did attrocities with or without consent of Officers. Unfortunately, in Tripoli this is the case. That was thought the last of huge massacres from Greek side. From the other side, thought, Ottomans and Egyptians continued ravaging populations till the European Intervention.

This event is taboo here in Greece, mostly because Revolution is and considered one of the most noble deeds our ancestors did, with the creation of Greek National State, so anything that doesn't fit this narrative it is left out of School Curriculum (but somehow not in Universities Curriculum) with the exception of Civil Wars during Revolution.",,/r/europe/comments/iy7rr3/on_this_day_in_1821_approximately_8000_civilians/g6b8u6c/,C_the_Puzzleheaded,1600864811

I just read through the thread and decided when you went on a rant about how haber bosch is chemical and bad; and natural manure is good that you were an idiot appealing to nature. Ironically this is similar to many veganists you seem to accuse. 

Yes, the haber process introduced nitrogen molecules into the natural cycle - thus increasing the size of the cycle - allowing it to sustain 7 billion people and our livestock rather than less than half of that. Of course you need to accept that without the haber process, much of the population of this planet as well as its livestock starve to death. 

&gt; Yes, you are right. I am claiming nature is better for nature then a chemical plant. And you try to disprove me. Good luck. 

Appeal to nature. Our livestock isn't ""natural"" and cannot survive naturally. If we let all the cows in europe out to roam naturally, the vast majority will starve to death. If we do the same with humans; yeah those starve to death as well.

Before haber bosch, naturally occuring nitrate rocks were mined in Chile and transported here to use as fertilizer; which requires vastly more energy and waste. 

You seem to continuously ignore the fact that without haber bosch; we literally cannot feed people or our livestock. But hey, chemical plant bad because something something nitrogen. 

&gt; Yep, just like how vegans do the same.

Glad you realise you're doing exactly what you accuse others from; while pretending to know better.

1352,"It was an exaggeration, but what I said is not really wrong. Let me introduce you **THE SINGLE MOST UNDERRATED THING IN HUMAN HISTORY.**

Crop farming (especially vegan farming) means monocultures, a type of crop farming which uses a ridiculously huge amount of fertilizer. And traditionally, the source of fertilizer were cows. They literally shit gold. 

Around the fourties two guys came up with a method which extracts nitrogen from the air. It takes non-reactive nitrogen molecules and creates really bad greenhouse gases in return.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber\_process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process)

&gt; The Haber–Bosch process is one of the largest contributors to a buildup of [reactive nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_nitrogen) in the [biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere), causing an anthropogenic disruption to the [nitrogen cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_cycle).[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process#cite_note-45) 

The part about the nitrogen cycle is much much more important than any other sentence in this thread.

Cows (like every animal) is part of the cycle. They are part of the water cycle, they are part of the carbon cycle, they are part of the nitrogen cycle. Cows cannot ingest nutritions consisting nitrogen outside from natural sources. Every resource a farm animal can access is part of the natural cycle already.

But the haber process is not. 

Another quote from wiki:

&gt; **Nearly 50% of the nitrogen found in human tissues originated from the Haber–Bosch process.**[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process#cite_note-48) Thus, the Haber process serves as the ""detonator of the [population explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_explosion)"", enabling the [global population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_population) to increase from 1.6 billion in 1900 to 7.7 billion by November 2018.[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process#cite_note-Smil_1999-49) 

I hope this is not news: nitrogen molecules are the real problem when it comes to climate change. And half of the nitrogen circulation is from the haber process. Half of the nitrogen circulation is *the entire history of natural agriculture*, and the other half is a pretty modern chemical process.

Now that you know this, how ridiculous does it seem to blame cows for even the slightest bit of climate change?",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/iy48rn/europes_livestock_farming_is_worse_for_the/g6auqxx/,Marc_A_Teleki,1600850496

The number includes one completed attack in the UK, one failed attack in Lithuania and four foiled plots (three in the UK and one in Poland). Two attacks committed by right-wing extremists were reported by Germany, but under national law could not be classified as terrorism. These claimed the lives of three  people. As in previous years, all perpetrators motivated by right-wing ideology were male and nationals of the country in which the attack took place or was planned.

If anything, post-Cold War Italy has had the opposite problem.

Fewer parties might work better. Not a two-party system, God forbid, but 5-6 parties, especially since the larger have room for internal factions.

1462,"Is it a default? Because I don't have it and I don't remember unsubbing from it either.

Regardless: Yes. It is a single subreddit, and as such is by default prone to circle-jerk. Never visited that one, so no idea what's it like there. But by default, a single subreddit is prone to becoming an echo chamber. But that should be self-evident and it only requires a quick hop to another subreddit to have completely different echoes thrown at you. Subreddits are specific, but Reddit as a whole has a lot of stuff.

Again, this doesn't *stop* the effect and might not even *hinder* it, but it should make it more *obvious*, which I thought was the point. Facebook et al can subtly nudge you at a direction by being sneaky about what they promote. Reddit doesn't exactly do that, you won't see subreddits you don't sub to and you can unsub the defaults.

In a proper world they would be forced to though. apple changing the connection of a port but running a compatible protocol on it isn't okay.

I asked the question not to be pretentious, but because I wanted to know if your perspective is from an educated position or not, and it's not, it's from a bad one...
Long story short even though I'm talking to a brick wall: Apple is already using USB-C even in iPhones, they're just making it so it's not compatible with everyone else's. So once again this isn't a case of government telling people what they should do in the way you're framing it.

By and large, the bigger Member States reared the most livestock:

* Spain accounted for 22% of the EU’s pigs, 9% of the EU’s bovines, 25% of the EU’s sheep and 23% of the EU’s goats.
* Germany accounted for 18% of the EU’s pigs and 15% of the EU’s bovines.
* France accounted for 9% of the EU’s pigs, 24% of the EU’s bovines, and 12% of the EU’s sheep.

There were some other Member States that were relatively specialized:

* Denmark accounted for 9% of the EU’s pig population and the Netherlands a further 8%.
* Ireland accounted for 9% of the EU’s bovine population.
* Greece accounted 14 % of the EU’s sheep population and 31 % of the goat population.

1625,"There have been quite a few advances since then. Generation 3 reactors are commonly used, but the new ones are generation 4. Generation 4 reactors are more safe and more efficient in their use. The very high temperature ones might be able to breed more fuel than they consume and provide hydrogen as a byproduct for use in the automotive industry. Molten salt reactors cannot melt down and are considered the safest of them all. Even with full power or containment loss the reaction will just stop.


Reactor 3 designs are already really safe. They have passive systems that take over in case of cooler interruption. That can keep the reactor cooled for days without external power. (Fukushima exceeded that time).


Generation 2 designs were what was used in the 70/80's. These are more safe than the generation 1 reactors but required an outside power source to keep the reactor cooled.

If this is the case, you'd have to start banning people, which definitely works - after all you rarely see spambots here, and they are easily replicated and only exist to mindlessly post whatever they were designed to on their platform, so I'd say it works on actual people who can get frustrated after a few attempts as well.

1650,"&gt;The word ""Balkan"" is often used to discriminate against the people that live in Southeastern Europe

That means nothing. Eastern Europe, Middle East, Baltic States and a bunch of other geographical terms have been used similarly. Doesn't mean that they other inherently discriminatory. 

&gt;Even I have heard it used in a derogatory way in Greece. ""Εμείς δεν είμαστε Βαλκάνια, είμαστε Μεσογειάκη χώρα"" etc. 

These people have an inferiority complex.

&gt;Greece, strictly speaking is not a Balkan country. A very small part of the country is within the loose definition of ""Balkan"".

Yes it is. It is not 100% in the Balkans but it is mostly in the Balkans. Our capital and biggest cities are in the Balkan peninsula, as well as most of our territory. We are for all intents and purposes in the Balkans.

&gt;Greece is a Mediterranean country officially, loosely part of West Europe

Being a Mediterranean country is not mutually exclusive with being in the Balkans. 

&gt;loosely part of West Europe

This is a Cold War remnant. It holds no significance over geographical or cultural divisions.

&gt;Strictly speaking, Greece is also a Southeastern European country.

Which is different from the Balkans in what way?

&gt;Balkan is best left to refer to the Ottoman occupation, whereby that word was invented. I, personally, do not want to refer to my country as ""muddy forest"" as is the proper translation of ""Balkan"".

I don't know how the etymology of the word is relevant. It has long lost it's original meaning. Not that ""muddy forest"" is particularly offensive.

I suggest we stop with the mental gymnastics and accept that we are part of the Balkans and being part of it is not necessarily a bad thing.

As long as we, the people in the Balkans, consider the word a slur, it's gonna remain a slur.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/ixmanv/european_union_flag_with_map/g6a60mb/,KinkyRedPanda,1600829695

1790,"&gt;Does TikTok data get stored in China?

&gt;TikTok says user data is stored only in the U.S. and Singapore.

&gt;Trust but verify: Jackson and I watched data flow out of the app, and did not see any headed to addresses that were clearly based in China. Most went to cloud services such as Amazon Web Services. But “it’s possible (and likely) that data transmitted to these servers are transferred to other locations but it’s not verifiable from our end,” Jackson said. He also found several references in the app to Internet addresses based in China or registered there, though saw no traffic going to them.

&gt;And good practices today don’t necessarily mean good practices tomorrow. TikTok’s U.S. privacy policy leaves the door open a crack. “We may share your information with a parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate of our corporate group,” it reads.

They won't be able to do so in any short delay (or even medium delay) as this would probably imply to rewrite big parts of Facebook and may be even an impossible task.

Facebook is currently conceived as one big single worldwide social media. You can be in the US and comment a photo of your Italian cousin, and viceversa. This means data transfers (to make it simple).

So it's not bluff, the only choice left to Facebook with current regulator stance is: withdraw from Europe, as the alternatives are not viable (they can't ignore European justice and fines, and they can't rewrite from scratch Facebook).

That said: good riddance. The idea of a single company controling such a worldwide social media shouldn't have existed.

These options are unacceptable for them, so instead of fixing it (or keeping quiet about it and hoping it'll just go away), they opt for removing the imbalance by getting rid of the Euro itself.

For me being antifa means that I am against the fascist ideology and their execution (ultranationalism, hate of foreigners, discrimination in general, violence and act of violence to stop democracy, populism, cease of power)

To suppose that less support from the EU countries would have prevented the war from happening is hard to back up with evidence, since it’s a strictly theoretical position. Historical precedent shows that the USA is no stranger to unilateral action, so I would argue that even if no EU country had joined the coalition, they still would have gone ahead anyway.

&gt;The fact you refuse to acknowledge that is why the SD is getting more popular.

SD is a party for people who like feelings over facts...
And the immigration issue is a real issue, i think its good that they are discussing it, voting for them on the other hand is idiotic...
We have seen during this pandemic that the only thing SD can do is run a blame game...

&gt;The fact that you cannot even comprehend that fact is disturbing and show a major lack of awareness and empathy. A 20 year old Swedish girls experience of life is a lot different to what her mother's was 30 years ago and a lot of that is due to harassment from immigrants.

2255,"This could be a move in the right direction, or an awful mess …

First, of course, it is important to remember that one-half of the lifecycle carbon footprint of an automobile is generated during manufacturing. We shall do the maths, but it is entirely possible that the overall carbon footprint of the British fleet of roadgoing vehicles be smaller *by keeping old clunkers rolling and smoking* (and putting the accent on traveling less often, slower, not that far, and increasing the occupancy rate of vehicles). Of course, reducing the carbon footprint of passengers transportation absolutely demands that mass transit systems be developed and overhauled, specially electric trains.

The awowed ambition to

&gt;give a new lease of life to the UK car industry

may be a hint that all this is a merely disguised attempt at carrying on *business as usual*.

I find specially dubious that the existing electrical grid and infrastructure could cope *as is*. My own calculations ^1 rather point toward the *doubling* of generation capacities. All of the scenarios that I've seen so far where all the cars are electrified while the infrastructure remains unchanged demand a rationing system where charging (and therefore driving) isn't anymore *on demand* but rather *when possible and when allowed by the authorities*, which is quite a departure from the traditional usage of automobiles.

Then, there is, of course, the question of manufacturing tens of millions of batteries in ten years, and whether there exists enough raw material on Earth.

At any rate, an electric car cannot be a drop-in replacement for an internal combustion one. The use-case is significantly different, enough to consider significant alterations in the ways and reasons why we move around, with impacts on work, education, logistics and procurement and so on. Making sensational announcements on all-electric without careful consideration would be a fool's rethorics.



--------------------------------

1] based on the statistics of consumption of fuel by automobiles and the energy content of said fuels. And again, as with all things electric, the question is multifold. There is the overall generation (measured in TWh per annum), the instant power call (in GW), the carrying capabilities of the grid, and the ability of the grid to balance all this.

2307,"&gt; Both, Technician and Master, can be considered as tertiary educational degree, in my opinion harder then getting a Bachelor degree from your local university. But the EU and OSCE don't get that and still don't count them as tertiary.

FFS no. That's exactly the kind of dumb shit that always appears in these threads. They don't count them as tertiary education because they are not tertiary education. What counts as tertiary education is not defined by your subjective perception of how ""hard"" they are, how long they take, your income after you finish, or any of these criteria that ordinary people tend to make. It's perfectly possible for a vocation qualification to meet the criteria for tertiary education. It's usually a question of how many hours are actually dedicated to teaching and how much of the qualification is purely on the job experience. Evidently many Germany apprenticeships don't meet these criteria given the data above.

&gt;where all nurses, programmer and lab technicians have grinded a bachelor degree without any on the job training.

Again, stupid. Since where did a university qualification preclude someone from having on the job training? Do you think nursing degree in foreign countries are taught entirely in lectures and don't involve working in hospitals? There are no labs on universities, and programmers cannot practise their trade without being at a company. This just feels like you need to make negative implications about how qualifications out of some perverse sense of being short-changed in this dataset.

edit: A five-year-long vocational qualification is a respectable and valuable qualification that proffers valuable, marketable trade skills. Nobody needs to changes the definition of ""tertiary education"" to include this just because. What's really worrying about these threads is how defensive people get about how their qualifications are categorised. Master Electrician is no doubt a higher status job with better pay than being a language tutor with a BA in some foreign language, so why the hell does anyone feel the need to categorise the former as tertiary?",,/r/europe/comments/iwudgm/tertiary_educational_attainment_of_people_aged_30/g62x1cp/,kingofeggsandwiches,1600677375

Your correct I should have said that large LEO constellations are a new thing rather than just LEO sats.

&gt;cool, but are way too small to use the L band (need a bigger antenna, physics' a bitch)

GSM mobile phones transmit in L band, there not that big.

&gt;too small to onboard a single atomic clock of the required precision

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip-scale\_atomic\_clock#:\~:text=A%20chip%20scale%20atomic%20clock,laser%20as%20the%20light%20source.&amp;text=A%20more%20stable%20design%20based,demonstrated%20by%20NIST%20in%202019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip-scale_atomic_clock#:~:text=A%20chip%20scale%20atomic%20clock,laser%20as%20the%20light%20source.&amp;text=A%20more%20stable%20design%20based,demonstrated%20by%20NIST%20in%202019).

&gt;their GNS capabilities would make use of higher orbit

Higher orbit is needed when you have smaller 28 sat constellations so you can always see 3+ satellites. But using 500 satellites in a low orbit would also achieve the same thing.

Also  precision is generally determined by the number of satiates you can see  , so more satellite's means better accuracy.",,/r/europe/comments/iwo4wt/uk_to_reset_sat_nav_plans_after_scrapping_work_on/g62x2v2/,DecentAttention9,1600677424

She did not [mention](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/official-polish-lgbt-free-zones-place-eu-73044161) Poland by name, but did not need to.

Why strengthen LGBT rights? They are *already* implemented in our Treaty, Ursula. LGBT rights are *already* protected in the EU.

We don't need more words. We need action. But the EC refuses to do that.

&gt;Despite her desire to appear hardline on these issues, however, von der Leyen’s pledges are far-reaching, vague and difficult to implement. Even existing measures are not applied consistently and many member states fail to follow EU’s equality policies. A few particularly troublesome governments are likely to oppose her ideas. 

Exactly this. We already have laws protecting LGBT rights. We don't need more of those. We need action. We need an EC that *acts* and not just talks. We need to start defunding countries that don't comply with EU values and the rule of law. That's what von der Leyen should be focusing on. She could also start expelling EU commissioners. EU law doesn't state we need 27 of 'm. That's something the European Council decided. Kick out commissioners of countries that don't live by EU values and the rule of law. She could also bring them to court.

But von der Leyen does none of that. She refuses to do that. Just like her predecessor. Which only makes things worse and makes her one of the main culprits of the downfall of democratic rights in the EU.

All she does, is give us words, words, words.

Poland, and other countries that don't like EU values and the rule of law, you have *nothing* to fear from the EC.

2438,"&gt; Not that I particularly care 

Finally, a sentiment we both agree on. Your point still seems to imply that the termination of an absolutist theocracy was not a good thing because the state that substituted it was also not entirely democratic. I think that point is incredibly mute, in the sense that the fact that the newly formed kingdom of Italy was still quite behind in terms of representation and their suffrage was insuficient doesn't make a theocratic and absolute monarchy any better or any less anachronistic, even for the time. It was still a massive step forward.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  The thing is, I'm not even Catholic, so no I don't care about the pope at all.  

When one mentiones the holiness of Rome I tend to assume they are either foreigners or Papaboys, in your case you seemed to be both. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; However whether or not I like the papacy, it was still far more legitimate ruler of Rome than the king of Piedmont-Sardinia who had as much to do with the Eternal city as I have with ballet dancing. 

This point also seems quite mute to me, a lot of monarchies during the middle age up until the 1800 might also have had as much to do with the territories they controlled as you do with ballet dancing. If we were to eliminate every country that was ruled either by a monarch through conquest or obtained through marriage than a lot of modern European countries would be gone, to not speak of all the past one, that according to your logic wouldn't have existed at all. The papal state was not extranious to this and also enlarged itself through conquest. According to this same logic the constitution and Repubblic that was established was more legitimate than the rule of Pio IX because it was wanted and supported by actual Romans while Pio IX was Marchigian, but I suspect you still wouln't have supported that change.

Anyway, I agree that the Pope was considered at the time, by jure and the facto, the legitimate ruler of Rome and the papal states territories, but I think this is relatively unimportant. I agree with the idea of integrity of a state and the importance of a state legitimacy because if those concept didn't exist we would be doomed to continues political volatility with the borders of states changing constantly. However, some times history develops in such a way that the status quo can no longer be mantained. The bases for a state legitimacy had changed profoundly after the French revolution and after the 1848, the concept of a state legitimacy being given by dinasties or religious power was in decline. The Roman had already rebelled demanding a constitution, seeing how reticent the Pope was towards their demands and based on the trend towards the secularisation of society its really likely that this revolts would have continued. It might have been considered a legitimate state, but it centainly wasn't vaiable anymore. 

On top of that the question of wether or not the papal state was ""legitimate"" when it was a theocracy maintaining its citizens under an absolute monarchy, seems to me a bit unimportant. Their supposed legitimacy was simply not good enough of a reason to mantain a large group of people under a theocracy and absolutist rule in the 19th century.

I'm glad it happened, Italy and Rome (and the rest of the papal states) with it are now a Republic, and that might have never happened if the Pope had stayed in power over a big chuck of central Italy.

In fact for women Sweden now is less free and fair socially if not economically than it was in the 80's and 90's. And a lot of that is due to the pressure from migrants and they are worried about their daughters where as in their teenage years their parents never felt fear that something bad would happen to them.

2497,"Germany uses the ""dual system"", usually called Berufsausbildung for many jobs, that other nations have undergrad university degrees for (nursing, technicians, programmers, practicing child care and so much more)

A Berufsausbildung is open for teens with basic 10 year school diploma, while also alot of young adults who went full school circle (12 or 13 years) giving them a school diploma to attend universities go for a Berufsausbildung.

In a Berufsausbildung, you work in a company for 3 years (can be shorten to 2 1/2 or for some cases is 3 1/2) while also going to a certain school, called Berufsschule. Dual system of school based learning and on the job learning. 

When you finished your Berufsausbildung, you education pathes are not finished. For most of them you can do either a Techniker follow up (state sanctioned Technician title) or a Meister. (While it translates to Master, it's not to be understood as a university degree but as Master of his/her craft). Both of them are 2 or more years of additional education, state sanctioned exams and very learning intensive. And you aren't allowed to open your own business in slot of craft fields, if you are not a Master (or a non german EU Citizen, lul).

Both, Technician and Master, can be considered as tertiary educational degree, in my opinion harder then getting a Bachelor degree from your local university. But the EU and OSCE don't get that and still don't count them as tertiary. So Germany will always have much less tertiary degrees then other countries where all nurses, programmer and lab technicians have grinded a bachelor degree without any on the job training.

Vlaams-Brabant), Spain (País Vasco), Croatia (Jadranska Hrvatska), Italy (Emilia-Romagna) and the Netherlands (Utrecht).

In 2019, the share of tertiary educational attainment was equal or above the 40% target in 101 of the 237 NUTS level 2 regions for which data are available. Among these, there were nine regions where the share exceeded 60%: the capital regions of Sostinės regionas in Lithuania (70.4%), Warszawski stołeczny in Poland (69.2%) and Hovedstaden in Denmark (64.2%), followed by Utrecht in the Netherlands (64.1%) and the capital regions of Stockholm in Sweden (63.4%), Île-de-France in France (63.2%), Noord-Holland in the Netherlands, Bratislavský kraj in Slovakia (62.1% each) and Praha in Czechia (60.9%).

At the other end of the range, four of the six regions in the EU where the share of tertiary educational attainment was less than 20% were located in Romania — Nord-Est (15.5%), Sud-Muntenia (16.3%), Sud-Est (17.8%) and Sud-Vest Oltenia (18.6%) — one in Bulgaria, Severozapaden (17.1%) and one in Italy, Calabria (19.9%).

&gt; Recent research shows that increasing shortages in honeybees threaten pollination of crops in Europe. Although according to a study covering 41 European countries the overall number of honeybee stocks has increased by 7 per cent between 2005 and 2010 (to an estimated 13.4 million colonies with 7 billion honeybees), 15 countries have also experienced declines ranging from 4 per cent in Slovenia to 47 per cent in Switzerland. At the same time have changes in agricultural practices led to considerable changes in the need for pollination. Increases in pollinated crop areas are contributed to the growth of areas for producing biofuel crops (oilseed rape, sunflower and soybean), as have the use of pesticides led to a decline in the number of bees.

&gt; This map series demonstrates the links between supply density of honeybees and the number of colonies required to provide pollination services to pollinate crop areas. It can be seen that the supply of honeybees relative to the national demand varies considerably between European countries. Of all countries included in the survey, the United Kingdom’s shortage in honeybees is only surpassed by Moldova, making the need for habitat protection a critical task not only for changes in environmental but also in agricultural policies.",,/r/europe/comments/iwuo9s/honeybee_shortages_in_europe/g62n2ox/,CardboardElite,1600667949

Or perhaps qualifications aren’t as important for productivity? *Or* perhaps productivity is more a function of culture and work ethic than qualifications. Or maybe all of the above.

IDK about Denmark but in England the idea that the law can control religion has been firmly established for 700 years and it has been actively used to edit religion for centuries too. Jews were usually exempted from such laws across Europe because they didn’t consider Christians to be covered by the protections against usury, but that consideration has been irrelevant for centuries. 

&gt;	A discussion about the ethics of circumcision is fine but an outright ban would have the obvious effect...

Jews have had that discussion and most, like you, have decided that you’re fine with it. Muslims are mostly worse on that point, but at least they usually abandon it if they leave the faith when living in a non-circumcising community. Thus, any such discussion is probably futile, and is definitely far too slow 

&gt;	I'm extremely uncomfortable with the far right elements jumping on board this campaign using it as an excuse to ethnically cleanse Europe. Are you?

No, if they’re voting for the right thing for the wrong reasons that’s more useful than voting for the wrong thing for right reasons.

2648,"Britain cannot ""just leave"" the European Union because it must resolve the vexed Irish question, a question that can only be resolved by agreement between Dublin, London and the EU. So, under your logic, Britain isn't a sovereign country, and in fact the only non-sovereign country in the EU because it is (to my knowledge) the only country that cannot simply unilaterally secede from the EU, if it so chose to. 

In practical terms, Scottish independence and British secession have the same requirements. Referendum vote followed by vote being confirmed in parliament. So, I repeat, under your logic Scotland is an independent sovereign nation because it can leave the Union that is has given its sovereignty to.

Leaving that aside, the ability to unilaterally secede from the union that you've given your sovereignty to does not mean you are sovereign in that union. It simply means that the loss of sovereignty is voluntary and can be voluntarily reclaimed...by leaving the Union. 

A recent example of European Union action demonstrates the difference very clearly. Take the Eurozone response to Covid-19. Every Eurozone finance minister had to negotiate a bailout response, with the fiscally hawkish northern countries refusing or watering down many of the Southern European proposals. In the non-Eurozone countries, they just took whatever action they wanted, without needing permission from any foreign states finance minister. Rishi Sunak doesn't need to go to (say) Wopke Hoekstra and negotiate a response. He just does it. That's what it means to be sovereign. Maybe it doesn't mean much and the pooled sovereignty of the European Union is better, but to say that there is no difference between them is to display a breathtaking ignorance of the European Union. 

And, I think, to rather downplay the remarkable achievement that the European Union is. Pooled sovereignty is something that has hitherto never been tried. Why don't you stick up for it as an idea? Instead you seem to see the EU as just a European ASEAN, or some sort of trade equivalent of NATO.

Other than adhering to a different set of ideas, there is no distinction between a Christian Roman and a pagan one.

Roman was anyone who was a citizen of Rome and from 212 AD, every free man was elevated to the status of Roman citizen.

2732,"&gt; ""White nonsense""? Get a bloody grip of yourself. You have deliberately and incorrectly assumed my race, my age and my opinions to create a straw man of myself that couldn't be further from the real me. You are parroting destructive collectivist ideology, clearly have no self thought or worth if you think that people should be judged on the content of their nationality or race, or if you think that the genocide that's going on in China is permissable. You just want to swap western genocide for local genocide. I want to take power out the hands of dictators and hand it to people. You are clearly deluded if you think the participatory democracy I strive for and imperialist fascim are the same thing. I'm anti imperialist and anti war, that's why I believe in massive north/south wealth redistribution, not just measly foreign aid as it stands just now.

To call China ""fascist"" and their deradicalisation of extremism ""genocide"" is white people talk, it's the white people caricature of modern China.  It's the orientalism of 21st century.  Godwin's law.   It doesn't matter what colour you are on the outside, if you're parroting this nonsense, you're white on the inside and in your head.

&gt;You completely circumvented my question. Why is wanting the CCP - a genocidal, imperialist and racist government - to collapse racist. If you defend the Chinese regime, you are a racist who turns blind eye to genocide and murder of the proletariat and will do anything to line the bourgeoi pockets of CCP elites as long as it fits their happy little virtue signalling ideological narrative that makes them feel like they're the only person that sees the bigger picture. Pathetic. Stop creating straw man arguments and answer the question succinctly. Why am I racist?

The government has brought stability.  Wanting stability to collapse, which leads to the death of millions, is racist.  It's the white mentality ever since white colonialists reached Asia, and this mentality has not changed, it's just morphed into more sinister nonsense like ""bringing democracy"".  You think this way instead of asking for ""reform"", instead your language is ""collapse"", that says a lot, which is why the global south should really ignore and do the opposite of the what the global north suggest.

Keep in mind, 40 years ago China was poorer than Africa or India, now the situation is completely reversed.

The thing is, I'm not even Catholic, so no I don't care  about the pope at all.

On another note by  ""act of barbarism""  I wasn't referring to some abstract religious metaphor from the Bible, by that I simply meant that the Italian army's attack on Rome was barbaristic, because it kind of was.

The Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund are financial tools set up to implement the regional policy of the European Union. They aim to reduce regional disparities in income, wealth and opportunities. Europe's poorer regions receive most of the support, but all European regions are eligible for funding under the policy's various funds and programmes. The current Regional Policy framework is set for a period of seven years, from 2014 to 2020.

The Structural Funds are made up of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF). Together with the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund make up the great bulk of EU funding, and the majority of total EU spending.


Next click:


The regional policy of the European Union (EU), also referred as Cohesion Policy, is a policy with the stated aim of improving the economic well-being of regions in the European Union and also to avoid regional disparities. More than one third of the EU's budget is devoted to this policy, which aims to remove economic, social and territorial disparities across the EU, restructure declining industrial areas and diversify rural areas which have declining agriculture. In doing so, EU regional policy is geared towards making regions more competitive, fostering economic growth and creating new jobs. 


And one more:



The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is a fund allocated by the European Union. Its purpose is to transfer money from richer regions (not countries), and invest it in the infrastructure and services of underdeveloped regions.

2801,"The Government has formally scrapped Theresa May’s plans for a British version of the GPS satellite navigation programme, leading to parts of Whitehall now pushing for the UK to rejoin the EU’s Galileo system.

The UK Space Agency is expected to announce in the coming days that it has terminated the GNSS project, which Mrs May put £92m of taxpayer funds into in 2018.

Under a reset of Britain’s space ambitions, the agency is now poised to examine alternatives for a sovereign positioning system, including deploying satellites from OneWeb, the bankrupt space company the Government is paying £400m to rescue.

Multiple options are understood to be in consideration. Civil servants and parts of the industry have pushed for the reset to revive talks on joining the EU’s Galileo system, which Britain was frozen out of during Brexit negotiations. The Government said participating in Galileo was off the table.

Substantial differences have emerged within government about the merits of investing in OneWeb. UKSA officials and experts have disparaged the idea of repurposing the company’s broadband satellites to build a location system, saying they could suffer from signal interference and could not carry the heavy atomic clocks needed for accurate time signals.

Research on a British equivalent to Galileo and America’s GPS, which would have used heavier higher-orbit satellites, was estimated to cost between £3bn and £5bn, and the UKSA has been winding down industry contracts in recent weeks.

Alternatives to OneWeb could include a regional approach using geostationary satellites, which would be cheaper since fewer satellites would be needed to cover a portion of the Earth’s surface.

Accurate and secure positioning systems are seen as being of increasing national importance due to technologies such as autonomous cars and boats, and as foreign governments and criminals exploit the vulnerabilities of GPS.

Several British companies had been involved in developing Galileo before the European Space Agency moved work abroad after Article 50 was ­invoked.

The Government has agreed to take a 45pc stake in OneWeb, which entered bankruptcy in March, in a joint venture with India’s Bharti Global.

A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""The Government has set a clear ambition for a sovereign space programme which will bring long-term strategic and commercial benefits for the UK. Work is ongoing across Government to determine the UK’s positioning, navigation and timing requirements, and assessing options for meeting them.

""The UK will not participate in the EU’s Galileo programme. Current OneWeb satellites are used to deliver satellite communications services, not satellite navigation.""",British Isles,/r/europe/comments/iwo4wt/uk_to_reset_sat_nav_plans_after_scrapping_work_on/g61ht9l/,SirKeir,1600642065

2842,"There is something that always irks me in those beautiful pictures. I am French and often you see fantastic pictures like this one of villages in France that are beautiful too.

It is a testament to the skill of the artist photographer, of the care of the inhabitants, of the genius of the people that used the stone and their knowledge and lives and needs to create such beautiful architecture and shape nature and harmonize both. And it is an important reminder that patrimony protection laws and regulations from countries and the EU are important (just look at the ugly villages 10km down the road where those rules don't apply....)

But then I think about the people living there, in France, and I fear it is quite similar in the UK, and most of Europe.

The (far) countryside is populated by rich landowners and retirees of industry, often right to far right, often stating how there is only ""true""  citizen living here.... Or they are farmers and lower class workers, often very poor due to unemployment, without means to access the wealth shown on TV, in the city nearby and in the hands of the previously stated part of the population. Those are often frustrated for good reasons and... Too often turn their anger toward the foreign and anything they do not understand or do not interact much with.

Obviously there isn't only those and there is millions of great people, welcoming and smart and engaged living there too... But from my experience living in french countryside my whole formative years they are a minority. A small small minority.

And now I look at those beautiful pictures and I cannot stop thinking about how they hide the very unsightly hideousness that lead to the rises of populist right wing parties, Brexit........

I hope that I am wrong and that I am simply a pessimistic sad sac sour puss... I hope, but I fear I am not, and those pictures for all their beauty leave a bitter taste",Europe,/r/europe/comments/iwiz5v/beautiful_yorkshire_village/g61jayk/,drostan,1600642809

2895,"&gt;Most likely the price is not a necessity, and there would be no shortage of businesses willing to build in Dublin and make a profit

They are free to do so. Buy land, build a house, rent it out for 100€ or 10000€ a month. This is their own business model and responsibility if they can afford the land and building. The cheaper the better I think.

&gt;Abusing the limited amount of land in a city isn't much different from other forms of monopolies.

Nobody is forced to live in Dublin though. Living in hip areas with lots of shops and bars and leisure activities is a choice. Working in the center of Dublin is a choice as well. You are free to move and go anywhere you can afford to rent a flat, vice versa you have no right to move or go anywhere just because you want to.

It's like calling Gucci a monopoly because all women want it, but also calling it unfair, unethical and bad business because the prices are so high. If you want it, you gotta pay for it. If you want to live in the trendy or upper class districts of a capital that is a luxury, not a necessity.

Explains a lot. From a German voter position: Yep, we have a capitalist economy, and we know they are profit making bastards.

Thats a completely different topic though. I am 100% certain the Irish state would give them an apartment, just like they give you one here.

3067,"&gt; Standard of living and prosperity weren't bad in the post-war period.

Post war standard of living is always good because 1) countries are underpopulated, i.e. rent is low and unemployment is low, and 2) there is a ""Pikettian reset"", i.e. those who have the most lose the most during a big event like a world war, meaning that the natural increase of wealth inequality to the point that 95% is struggling terribly gets a reset. Why do we feel poorer than in the 60's? Because of shitty housing, and in the case of the US because of lack of access to healthcare and education.

The truth is China was not the cheapest country at the time of their economic reform. It certainly isn't the cheapest now. 

Manufacturing in China isn't based just on cheapness. It certainly was an important factor, though less so now. But there are many other factors that make China an attractive place. Here are some of them: large pool of educated labor to choose from, very large domestic market, stable government with friendly industrial policies, good export infrastructure, proximity to supply chain, etc.

Im not the ""you"" in this case, but Ill answer the way I see it. Russia was very limited on how they could use gas as a weapon against CEE  They could not cut off CEE long term without stopping their deliverers to Germany, which they simply can not afford. NS1+2 allows Russia to cut off CEE while still supplying to Germany.

&gt;Once Germany gets the gas, it can do whatever with it. It can sell the gas to neighbouring countries.

It cant sell what it doesnt have in surplus. If Russia decides to fuck around with our gas, they obviously wont send enough gas to Germany for their consumption and enough to cover CEE needs.

So... market price when considering bought volumes?

The entire ruling was unfair. They rewrote the contract, dropped ""take of pay"" from contract and enforced ""ship or pay"" which wasnt even in the contract. The only normal thing they did was Naftogaz had to pay for stolen gas.

3204,"&gt;You are trying to argue as if wearing black clothes and hiding ones face beneath a scarf and sunglasses during a protest is equivalent to fucking stalking, threatening and beating up, in some cases even murdering, people of other ethnicities or political opponents. That's idiotic and dishonest. 

Nope.

Its simply facilitating assault, arson, and murder, of random people by allowing criminals to mix into your ranks. And poison the whole ""movement""s image.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;the police, which rather has sympathies with the right than the left, uses spurious reasoning for prosecuting antifascist activists

WHen members of the movement form black block, and protect everyone no matter what they do, then maybe...  
...just maybe, the police is not hating your political ideology, but the fact that pyromaniacs, and thieves get free reign, thanks to your tactics.

Maybe its practical reasons, instead of ""it can only be due to evil shadow government of rightwing extremists""? ...can't that even play a part in how police views the movement?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Then there also is the fact that a lot of the crimes of antifascist activists are things like violations of the Public Meetings Act, vandalism or throwing bottles at heavily armored riot police. 

And in your opinion vandalism should be encouraged?  
Are you referring to molotv cocktails - i am pretty sure riot police are not THAT heavily armored?

Is simply NOT throwing stuff at the police, and NOT destroying random people' property who just happend to be in the wrong place at the wrong time not an option?  
Why are such practices acceptable?

(Just consider how much public goodwill right wing extremist don't put to risk by not effing up random people's stuff that happend to be at the wrong place)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You also seem to ignore that fascists quite frequently engage in false flag actions against antifascist activists, which Twitter exposed, for instance, where there were a lot of ""antifa"" accounts that actually belonged to right-wing extremist groups, which also use similar tactics in the real world. 

Conclusion?

Support their tactics, by continuing black block tactics shielding all hooligans in your ranks regardless of political persuasion.

(And ofc. black block tactics ensure that you can say ""that no true scottsman/ANTIFA member"" would ever do such thing, while promoting violent actions in doctrine)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I myself took part in several antifascist demonstrations unmasked, without ever being violent or even yelling shit like ""ACAB"" (which I think is a stupid sentiment anyways), and actually had real neonazis stalking and threatening me in public afterwards. 

And your response is to ""lets enable hooligans to wreck up people &amp; people's shit"" instead of ""lets eff up the stalkers""?

In the Community of Madrid, hospitals have an occupancy level of practically 80%, while in the rest of the country it is 70%
- Ayuso closes the 37 areas of Madrid most affected by the virus, although it will allow going to work and limits meetings to six people throughout the community
Fatima Knight September 19, 2020 1:01 p.m.

The hospitals of the Community of Madrid touch the abyss.
elDiario.es has had access to occupancy data –for Thursday– of practically the entire hospital network in the region –including public and private centers–. These data reflect the extent to which Madrid's healthcare is beginning to collapse again, after Primary Care has already been overwhelmed for weeks. COVID-19 is advancing in the region and health workers already admit fear of what may be to come. In some hospitals such as October 12, the Gregorio Marañón or the Infanta Leonor - the largest - are ""especially stressed"", they defend unions and experts, and there are complete ICUs: not only with coronavirus, but full.

The president of the Community of Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, announced this Friday the closure of 37 areas of the region with the highest incidence of cases in the last two weeks. As of Monday, the mobility of almost a million people who will be able to travel to work, go to school or care for dependents, among others, will be limited, but who will not be able to go out for leisure. The affected areas coincide almost entirely with the south of the capital and the region. It is in these areas that hospital occupancy is already very close to its maximum occupancy.

The data accessed by this newspaper reflect that 18 hospitals in Madrid already have an occupancy of over 90% of their capacity (between covid and non-covid patients) and in many ICUs they are at 100%. With this scenario, the operating rooms are once again reconverted into areas to care for the most seriously ill, surgical interventions are suspended and tents are started to attend a wave of patients that are expected in the coming days due to the growing curve in contagions.
The public hospitals with the highest occupancy are the Gómez Ulla military hospital, which has 97.7% capacity and the ICUs at 100%, followed by the La Paz university hospital with 95.5% occupancy; that of the Southeast with 95.2%; the Infanta Cristina with 94.2% occupation in the plant and 100% in intensive care; Puerta del Hierro with 94.1% and 95.6% of the ICUs; the Infanta Leonor with 93.8% of the plant beds and 100% critical capacity and the University of Móstoles with 92.2%.
Of the largest hospitals in the capital, the Gregorio Marañón, in the heart of the capital, is already 80.8% occupied in the ward and 96.9% in the ICU, and on October 12, next to the districts with the highest incidence are already 81.8% and 85.3%, respectively. Both centers have a capacity of over 1,000 beds.

The Gómez Ulla Central Defense Hospital in Madrid, in the district of La Latina - the one with the highest occupancy - installed temporary hospital triage stores this Friday in its parking lot. The Gómez Ulla was already one of the hospitals that saw its capacities overwhelmed in the first wave of the pandemic and now, given the increase in cases in Madrid and its capacity already at the limit, it has decided to go ahead by expanding its capacities.

Only in the last day, the Community of Madrid has registered 5,000 new confirmed cases of coronavirus. There are a thousand more than those detected throughout the month of July. Since Spain entered the new normal after the general confinement on June 21, the Community of Madrid has become, week by week, the focus and main center of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In two months it has gone from a cumulative incidence in 14 days of 9 cases per 100,000 inhabitants on July 15 to another of 642 on September 16.
This prolonged and exponential growth is already noticeable in hospitals that are on the verge of their real capacity. The regional government always hides itself in the fact that the situation is not like the one in March, and it is right: then the plant beds and intensive care beds were tripled and all kinds of spaces were used. With these data we talk about the beds that are normally available in Madrid hospitals. The figures show that we are once again overflowing with capacity. The greatest concentration occurs in the central and southern areas of the region.
In the Community of Madrid, hospitals are at an occupancy level of practically 80% (in the rest of the country, excluding Madrid, it is 70%). and 18 of 59 hospitals in Madrid are currently at an occupancy rate of over 90%, while 37 of them have an occupancy rate of over 80%, according to figures from July 16.

If we only attend to beds occupied by Covid patients, Madrid is the autonomy with the highest percentage: 22%, when the national average is 8.5%. It is also very far from the second with the highest saturation in hospitals, which is Castilla-La Mancha (13%), according to the latest daily report from the Ministry of Health on September 16. The worst is in the ICU.
The pressure on the health system has overflowed in the health centers and now lines up the Intensive Care Units. It is the next indicator, together with hospitalizations, to measure the evolution of the second wave. As of September 16, 371 people were already admitted in critical condition.

According to data by hospitals, in intensive care the occupation in public centers in Madrid is already at 87% of its capacity, a figure that is far from that offered by those responsible for the Ministry of Health who defend that it is 40%. Between public and private, this occupancy drops to 79%, but it is still double that offered by the department of Enrique Ruiz Escudero.
Workers' Commissions explains that the Ministry includes to calculate the proportion occupied ICU beds all those available in these auxiliary units that are usually full when the surgeries work at full capacity. The health workers of various hospitals in the south of Madrid with whom elDiario.es has spoken agree that the problem is not the space –reformed in most centers during the first wave–, but the lack of professionals. A part has not yet returned from the holidays and the job boards are exhausted, according to the unions. Which puts professionals back in a situation of stress and alert.

New restrictive measures
The Madrid president announced this Friday the partial confinement in 37 areas of the region most affected by the pandemic in this second wave. For at least two weeks, more than 850,000 people will see their ability to move autonomously restricted, among other capacity limitation measures. ""What we have detected is that there are 37 areas throughout the Community of Madrid where the incidence is much higher. We are talking about 1,000 infections per 100,000 inhabitants, a very serious figure. We are obliged to take a series of measures to contain the spread of the virus "", said the Madrid president.

One of the measures proposed by President Isabel Díaz Ayuso is to reopen the Ifema field hospital, which would mean the recognition that Madrid's health system is no longer able to supply more than four months after having closed it with a party in the one that the Madrilenian president boasted of management and caused an inexplicable agglomeration.

In March and April, Ifema sustained itself at the expense of Primary Care health workers and the regional government now does not explain how they intend to maintain it in the event that it is reopened, while ensuring that “there are no more health workers on the lists of unemployment, ""according to Ayuso herself on Tuesday during the State Debate in the region.

3400,"I can assure you I’m not attacking you. Concentrating on this specific example then, metros in Warsaw help achieve climate goals set by the EU and heighten productivity in the region. They're like bricks, building up to become a house. With each brick we place, we come closer to the finished building. When you look at a construction site, you don't say “Why are they placing a brick, it's not going to achieve anything”. If we finance projects like these then Poland can concentrate their spending on other projects, making the economical and societal progress of the bloc grow. The problem, or maybe the reason, why you don’t see this as a success for your country is that you don’t understand or haven’t accepted the scope of the European project. By creating better standards in poorer nations, we create a more equal EU, which helps us become more resistant to influences from other global superpowers, like Russia in the east, and China and the US in all of Europe. Not understanding this is the reason why the UK left. As sad as it may have been, they had it coming. They never accepted being part of the European community. Furthermore, something that might directly interest you, higher standards of living mean people buy more stuff, which means richer countries get to sell more stuff to them, which in turn strengthens both economies. This is but a beneficial side effect of the more important goal that is being achieved, European unity, which is more important than even in these times. The propaganda that tells you your money is being wasted is what drives anti-EU sentiment, because it’s really not. When Poland will have finished developing to become a modern European nation, not only will we have become more resistant to outside influence, but we’ll also have gained a strong trading partner in the most powerful union of values and economic bloc in the world.

**Ου με πείσεις καν με πείσης**, που λέει και ο Αριστοφάνης. Εχεις δίκιο το ότι τον ψάχνανε καιρό το μπασταρδι και κάλεσαν λίγο πριν τα μεσάνυχτα το κομβόι να πάει εκεί που ήταν οι Φυσσαιοι δεν αποδεικνύει ότι το σχεδίαζαν. Από τη δικογραφία και τις καταθέσεις προκύπτει ότι στην ΧΑ δεν κουνιόταν ούτε φύλλο χωρίς εντολή του φυρερ και ότι τηρείται απόλυτη ιεραρχία η οποία προκύπτει ΚΑΙ από το καταστατικό της οργάνωσης (το οποίο θέλει να θάψει η υπεράσπιση, αναρωτιέμαι γιατί) ΚΑΙ από τη σειρά τηλεφωνηματων την νύχτα της δολοφονίας αλλά γιατί να το αφήσουμε αυτό να μας χαλάσει την ωραία σούπα. Εν βρασμώ ψυχής έγινε ο, τι έγινε. Αναρωτιέμαι γιατί ο Αγγος όταν είδε τον Φυσσα στο Κοράλλι κάλεσε τους από πάνω ενώ δεν είχε καμία διένεξη μαζί του όταν το έκανε αυτό 🤔 Μάλλον επειδή δεν τον έψαχναν να τον σκοτώσουν. Επιμένεις να λες fight ενώ ο δολοφόνος δεν είχε ούτε γρατζουνιά και είχε πάει κατευθείαν έτοιμος με το μαχαιράκι του. Το κατάλαβα ότι δεν σε ενδιαφέρει η δίκη της χρυσης αυγής κι ας προσποιείσαι ότι δεν τους γουστάρεις γιατί μετά από 7 χρόνια δικής της εγκληματικής οργάνωσης που έφτασε 3ο κόμμα στη Βουλή θα είχε αρπάξει το αυτάκι σου ότι δεν ήταν in broad daylight οπως είπες πιο πάνω αλλα λίγο πριν τα μεσάνυχτα.

Ο, τι είχες να συνεισφέρεις στη συζήτηση ήταν ότι το θύμα δεν ήταν καλός και ήταν εξίσου κακός με αυτούς που τον σκότωσαν και εκεί φαίνονται οι προτιμήσεις.

 Μπορεί να κουράστηκες να λες ότι δεν τους συμπαθείς αλλά είναι ξεκάθαρο ότι τους συμπαθείς περισσότερο από τον νεκρό που αυτοί δολοφόνησαν. Μπορείς να κάνεις το βλακα και να αρνείσαι την πραγματικότητα όσο θες όπως και να κρατάς μόνο τις πληροφορίες που σε συμφέρουν όπως το ότι ο Φυσσας ήταν στο ρεσαλτο.

3514,"Well Germany did not oppose the Euro itself , it did just oppose the way of its introduction. Germany wanted further more European Integration, ( more fiscal authority in Brussels, European Army,...) , and only after that the common currency.

It is really important to understand that we have the Euro the way it was introduced because of the German Reunion  and NOT the Euro itself because of the German Reunion . 

It was a high price the pay for Germany but it has to. In the end it was a trade of 

- The early Euro
- Giving up the Lands Poland annexed after WW2 
- Paying between 25 - 40 billion Euro to the Kreml for removing its troops and making promises to Gorbachev which where worth nothing a year later

&gt;Αυτό ακριβώς έγινε και το βράδυ της δολοφονίας του Παύλου Φύσσα, αυτό που περιγράφει ο Πατέλης. Το βράδυ της δολοφονίας του Παύλου **τηρήθηκε απολύτως η ιεραρχία**. Από το Αναγνωστέο 275 και τα συνημμένα παραρτήματα αυτού, προκύπτει ότι από τις 10 το βράδυ της 17ης.9.2013 και μετά υπάρχει μεγάλη κινητικότητα τηλεφώνων μεταξύ των κατηγορουμένων, αλλεπάλληλες κλήσεις μεταξύ τους. Συγκεκριμένα,\[...\] ο **Αγγος μιλάει από τις 10 το βράδυ και μετά με τους κατηγορουμένους Καλαρίτη, Χρυσαφίτη και Μιχάλαρο**. Με τον **Μιχάλαρο μιλάνε από** ***22.45*** **και μετά, 4 φορές**, \[...\] τι κάνει ο Ιωάννης Αγγος; Τηρεί την ***ιεραρχία***. **Ενημερώνει τον ανώτερό του, τον Καζαντζόγλου**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Στις ***23:19:20*** ο **Αγγος** τηλεφωνεί στον **Καζαντζόγλου** και τον ενημερώνει για την παρουσία του Παύλου Φύσσα, εν συνεχεία ο **Καζαντζόγλου**, στις ***23:21:01***,\[...\], τηλεφωνεί από το σταθερό του τηλέφωνο στο κινητό του **Γ. Πατέλη**, και μιλάνε για **198 δεύτερα**. Το κλείνουν και αμέσως ο πυρηνάρχης **Πατέλης** τηλεφωνεί στον **ανώτερό** του, στον περιφερειάρχη και **βουλευτή της Χρυσής Αυγής Ιωάννη Λαγό**. \[...\]στις ***23:26*** τηλεφωνεί ο **Πατέλης** από το σταθερό του σπιτιού **2 φορές στον Λαγό** \[...\] και στις ***23:27*** ο Ιωάννης Λαγός\[...\]**παίρνει πίσω τον Πατέλη με διάρκεια κλήσης 63 δεύτερα**. \[Θυμηθείτε, «[Αν πάρω το o.k. από τον Λαγό, θα σας έρθει μήνυμα](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlePaTZpvS0)».\] [\[1\]](https://www.efsyn.gr/ellada/dikaiosyni/i-diki-tis-hrysis-aygis/43463_oti-kineitai-sfazetai)

(*****23:28:45*****)** \[...\] Μόλις ο Πατέλης έκλεισε το τηλέφωνο με τον ανώτερό του Ιωάννη Λαγό, αμέσως στέλνει μαζικό μήνυμα (sms). Εχουμε, δηλαδή, **απόλυτη τήρηση ιεραρχίας και πειθαρχίας**. \[...\] με το που φεύγει το sms, ξεκινάνε τα τηλέφωνα μεταξύ των κατηγορουμένων. Υπακούοντας στην εντολή του ανωτέρου τους, τα μέλη συγκεντρώνονται ταχύτατα στην τοπική της Νίκαιας σε προχωρημένη νυχτερινή ώρα και συγκροτείται άμεσα το Τάγμα Εφόδου. Και πηγαίνουν όλοι μαζί, ένα κονβόι αυτοκινήτων και μηχανών των μελών της Χρυσής Αυγής, που είδαμε στις κάμερες ασφαλείας επί της οδού πρώην Τσαλδάρη, νυν Παύλου Φύσσα, έξω από το «Κοράλλι». Στις ***23:49*** ο περιφερειάρχης Πειραιά καλεί τον **Γ. Πατέλη** και στις ***23:51*** (σελ.105), *πριν ξεκινήσει η δολοφονική επίθεση*, ο **Λαγός** στέλνει ένα **sms στον Πατέλη** και δίνει το **τελικό «Ο.Κ.»** για την επίθεση. \[...\] ο *Λαγός έχει ζωντανή ενημέρωση* για την εξέλιξη της επίθεσης. Από τα Αναγνωστέα 272 και 273, προκύπτει ότι η πρώτη **κλήση προς το ΕΚΑΒ** έγινε από τον **αστυνομικό της ΔΙΑΣ Χρήστο Δεληγιάννη** στις ***00:04***, οπότε η δολοφονία πραγματοποιήθηκε **λίγο πριν από τις 00:04**.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Ενώ καταγράφονται αλλεπάλληλες κλήσεις μεταξύ των κατηγορούμενων χρυσαυγιτών, πριν και μετά τις 12 το βράδυ, υπάρχει ένα διάστημα λίγο πριν από τη δολοφονία κατά το οποίο επικρατεί απόλυτη σιγή***\*.\* Αν ανατρέξετε στα σχετικά διαγράμματα δεν υπάρχει καμία κλήση κατηγορουμένων μεταξύ ***23:58*** **(Σαντοριναίος - Αναδιώτης)** και ***00:04:46*** **(Δανίκας - Σκάλκος),** η επόμενη δε κλήση, μεταξύ απάντων των κατηγορουμένων είναι στις ***00:06*** **(Χρυσαφίτης σε Χρυσαφίτη,** Διάγραμμα 5). **Τουλάχιστον για 6 λεπτά κανένας από τους κατηγορουμένους δεν πραγματοποιεί ούτε δέχεται καμία κλήση, γιατί είναι το διάστημα όπου εξελίσσεται η επίθεση,** ... Μετά τη δολοφονία, βέβαια, τα τηλέφωνα των κατηγορουμένων παίρνουν και πάλι φωτιά. ... παίρνει ο **Λαγός** στις ***00.15*** στο κινητό του **Πατέλη**, προκειμένου να ενημερωθεί, και συνομιλεί μαζί του για **43˝**. Αμέσως μετά (***00:17***) ο **Ρουπακιάς**, ήδη προσαχθείς από τους αστυνομικούς, **παίρνει επίσης τον Πατέλη στο κινητό** για να τον ενημερώσει (διάρκεια κλήσης **51˝**).

Ο τελευταίος βλέπει την κλήση και **παίρνει πίσω τον Πατέλη**· ***00:30*** **Λαγός-Πατέλης και συνομιλούν για 139˝**. Τον ενημερώνει ότι ο Ρουπακιάς, το μέλος του Πενταμελούς, συνελήφθη από αστυνομικούς.\[...\]Στις ***00:37*** ο Αρχηγός της Χρυσής Αυγής, Μιχαλολιάκος, στέλνει μήνυμα **sms** στον περιφερειάρχη Πειραιά **Λαγό** **από το προσωπικό κινητό του**. \[...\] Αμέσως **ο Λαγός παίρνει πίσω** τον Μιχαλολιάκο πάλι, στο προσωπικό του κινητό, με τον οποίο συνομιλεί για **45˝** .

Κι έπειτα ο **Πατέλης** συνομιλεί με τον κρατούμενο **Ρουπακιά** στις ***00:39***, σελ. 38, για **110˝**, ενώ συνομιλούν **άλλες 2 φορές** στις ***00:42*** **(7˝)** και στη ***01:17*** **(27˝),** \[...\] . **Δηλαδή, συγκροτείται το Τάγμα Εφόδου κατόπιν εντολής Λαγού, συλλαμβάνεται ο Ρουπακιάς, ενημερώνεται πρώτα ο Λαγός από τον Πατέλη στις** ***00:15***\*\*, και στις\*\* ***00:37 έχει ήδη ενημερωθεί ο Αρχηγός της Χρυσής Αυγής***\*\*.\*\* \[...\] Ωστόσο, \*\*από το σταθερό του Πατέλη (\*\*Αναγν. 275, σελ. 45) προκύπτει ένα ***κενό κλήσεων μεταξύ 23:27 και 00:28***.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Προκύπτει η **στοχοποίηση** του Παύλου Φύσσα από τη Χρυσή Αυγή:  
&gt;  
&gt;– Ηχητικά Δεβελέκου, **18.09.2013**, 11:59:28: «**Ξέρω πολύ καλά ποιος ήταν και τι καπνό φούμαρε, ήταν χωμένος βαθιά**», λέει για τον Παύλο.  
&gt;  
&gt;– Ηχητικά Αποστόλου, **18.9.2013**: ο Φύσσας «ήταν αναρχοάπλυτος», «**τους ψάχναμε καιρό αυτούς, είναι αυτοί που έχουν το Ρεσάλτο**» (αναρχικό στέκι στο Κερατσίνι), «**το ψάχναμε το μπαστάρδι τόσο καιρό**», αναφερόμενος στον Παύλο... «**τους ψάχναμε πολύ καιρό αυτούς στο Κερατσίνι**». Επιβεβαιώνεται έτσι και **η κατάθεση του προστατευόμενου μάρτυρα Γ, που είχε πει ότι το όνομα και το πρόσωπο του Παύλου Φύσσα ήταν γνωστό στην Τοπική της Νίκαιας, καθώς είχε συζητηθεί ως στόχος.**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;– Ο Αποστόλου, \[...\] «**Για να κάνεις κάτι παίρνεις πρώτα το Γιάννη, ο Γιάννης το λέει στον μεγάλο, και αν δώσει το o.k. ο μεγάλος, πας**». Και εδώ υπενθυμίζω την κατάθεση του Ηλία Σταύρου, ο οποίος γνώριζε προσωπικά τον Ιωάννη Λαγό: «**Ειδικά ο Λαγός δε θα έδινε καμία εντολή, αν δεν ήξερε ότι έχει την έγκριση του Αρχηγού**».  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\] Από Αποστόλου φαίνεται πώς αντιλαμβάνονται οι χρυσαυγίτες τη βία «**έκανε κάτι καλό για το κόμμα \[ενν. ο Ρουπακιάς\] και πήρε πόντους**».  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Συγκεκριμένα, ο οργανωμένος χαρακτήρας της ανθρωποκτονίας Φύσσα προκύπτει από:   
&gt;  
&gt;α. Την **άμεση και ταχεία ΣΥΓΚΡΟΤΗΣΗ** της ομάδας ασφάλειας («τάγματος εφόδου» κατά το βούλευμα) της Τοπικής Νίκαιας **μέσω τηλεφώνων και sms**,

&gt;

3855,"It is a solid mess for sure.

Best i can tell, the problem is that many traditional workers parties has since the 90s embraced neoliberal economics and tied themselves to the main mast of EU.

This while the workers, rightly or wrongly, see EU as dismantling many of the hard fought working class rights that allowed them to have a predictable future.

And then came the 2008 crash and subsequent austerity decrees, driving many workers to vote extremist right wing as they at least sound like they acknowledge the problem. But the ""solutions"" offered by the extremist right are childishly simplistic, as they constantly blame a external source rather than that it is a systemic and thus complicated issue.

3888,"I disagree, first of all large declines of 30% population in only 50 years cripples the economy and living standards.

We don't just suddenly have a lot less people, there is a lag time in demographics and we end up with aging populations and the huge imbalance of workers to dependents that they cause.

That results in more working hours and higher taxes leading to more poverty just to support basic standards. Our pensions systems are already unsustainable, and will only get worse.

Japan has seen over the last decade a rise in suicide and sudden death (work stress related heart attacks etc.) due to overworking, which has a specific word, ""karoshi"". Reasons range from company pressure on staff to work more due to staff shortages, to people trying to provide for themselves and their families (sometimes 1 grandchild working to support 2 parents and 4 grandparents due to one child families).

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-overwork-idUSKCN0X000F

Supporting your elderly relatives lasts well beyond childbearing age, making it even more difficult to pay for having children, creating a self-reinforcing loop. The cost of raising children is one of the most significant issues causing low birth rates.

When we we are in a position where don't know how to stop said decline, a huge uncontrollable decline is not beneficial. With our current inability to reverse the trend, and our poor ability to mitigate the harmful effects, encouraging such a decline is a very bad idea.

If anybody knew of reasonable policy measures that could bring us back up to replacement rate, then we could consider a managed decline where appropriate. However, a falling population will not help enough when we also have people who unironically consume vast amounts and destroy the planet, whilst preaching that other people must have less children to reverse the effects of them destroying the planet.

Scientific and technological developments and consumption changes are far better ways to reduce the stress we put on the environment. Whereas if we have less people then we have less potential scientists and innovators, and economic stress or collapse from population decline will further reduce our ability to invest in R&amp;D.

Why cause huge amounts of suffering through catastrophic population declines when we could instead fix the damage that we do to the environment?",,/r/europe/comments/ivy0nl/emerging_europes_attempts_to_counter_depopulation/g5wbjly/,FCPTAN,1600563685

&gt;Well yeah if you're getting root canals or crowns or something yeah it's gonna be expensive.

Why? In my country there is no procedure of any kind that costs so much you could get a car, non-dental healthcare is government funded. I don't think people should have to go to another country to access care they need, whether it's a checkup or operation - that's not normal.

&gt;If you normally pay for NHS dental treatment, the amount you spend will depend on what treatment you need. Some people do not have to pay for NHS dental treatment.

&gt;**[NHS dental charges](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/dental-health/how-much-will-i-pay-for-nhs-dental-treatment/)**

&gt;There are 3 NHS charge bands:

&gt;Band 1: £22.70

&gt;Covers an examination, diagnosis and advice. If necessary, it also includes X-rays, a scale and polish, and planning for further treatment.

&gt;Band 2: £62.10

&gt;Covers all treatment included in Band 1, plus additional treatment, such as fillings, root canal treatment and removing teeth (extractions).

4005,"&gt;Isn't that ironically what started all these riots, that of course we need a police force, but that people who don't deserve to get shot end up shot and that that shouldn't happen? 

People are protesting because the justice system failed to prosecute police. People could accept those unintended consequences if the justice system could account for them. Instead people feel as if they have to find justice by other means.

In a similar way the justice system fails to prevent the threat of racial supremacy and so people feel the need to take it into their own hands.

&gt;That's such a human element to problems we have. Addressing them always has unintended victims, but 

Yes

&gt;people are picking and choosing which are good and which are bad based on narrative. Like during Bush's term everyone wanted to get out of war because of all the unintended casualties of citizens, etc. It was always that ""War has unintended consequences, blow back, etc."" Then Trump pulls us out of Syria and it's ""no no we need to protect those people."" 

There's a difference between foreign and domestic unintended victims. Shit example.

&gt;Another example is conservatives are largely for the death penalty, and liberals are often very much against the death penalty because a few non-murderers get killed.

Also, we aren't unique, we're just the first area affected. Parts of Asia have experienced similar declines in birth rates. Africa and the Middle East are both highly unlikely to remain areas of large population growth in the long term.

Relying upon those regions and mass migration is short term thinking that delays us trying to find solutions to raise birth rates that aren't detrimental to our wellbeing.

Have you not seen the population predictions for states like Italy and Japan? We will lose huge proportions of our populations in just decades. Japan is projected to lose 30% in just 50 years.

4067,"&gt; The current one didn't exist in WWII. 

Same flag just w/o workers' hammer and sickle.

&gt;  I guess in a way the current flag was the flag of a dependant Belarus 

Nice selective thinking - so White-Red-White was a flag of a collaborationist Belorussia, but it doesn't count. And current one was in soviet days, when it Belorussia had mutual obligations with Union, so we can't use it.

No logic in this.

&gt; First of all, the German Empire =/= Nazis. 

Thanks, Einstein, but let me also remind you that WW1 was worst war world has ever seen before 1939 (1937? 1941?). 

And same idea of getting ""living space"" was used by German empire and Nazi Germany. 

Judging the way german capital expanded on warsaw bloc, yugoslavia (half-croatia is bought by germans), ex-soviet countries, from recent days Ukraine - principle remains, but in modern form.

&gt; Secondly, you're cherrypicking your examples here 

You blame me for cherrypicking but next you are cherrypicking belorussian nationalists yourself. ""These and these and these are bad, but these are good"".

&gt;The flag was designed for the BDR

Flag was (and is) used to create tension with nationalistic flavour.  

&gt;BDR

Why did Hitler tolerate BDR on occupied territory then? :)

[I'm sorry, my eyes must be lying then.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EfpiVaTWoAEDWg4.jpg) /s

Alright, name me military formation which fought for independecy of Belorussia back then. One which didn't accept neither of powers (official soviet, occupational german)?

Or it's all on paper again? 

&gt;This has nothing to do with your original argument

My original comment was that you are following ukraine's road, and judging how you ""forgot"" that in BDR there were collaborants, i wasn't that wrong. 

&gt; You have no argument for it being a Nazi flag

How can it be Nazi flag?

That's a flag used by Nazis, not more, not less. If you support nationalism and choose to close eyes on all the problems that inevitably come from that - that's your choice. 

&gt;and equates them like they're the same thing

No, I didn't, that's what you want me to do, but I didn't. Even more, if you reread, my problem with flag isn't colours or creator but rather the ideas that are pushed under it, which are dedicated to divide not only belorussian and ex-soviet people, but also belorussian people between each other.

Aside from looking better, getting the lines safely underground was part of the motivation behind the switch in new build.

4085,"You sound pretty biased as well btw. 

&gt;Turkey is not stealing anything. They are just scanning the area. Someone would call it a fake news ;).

Turkey is conducting drilling operators south of Cyprus. It's not just scanning, they have a drill (not just research) ship. 

&gt;Italy and Germany are totally against sanctions for Turkey. France has an other quarrel with Turkey and that is Libya. They would not go to war over Cypress. Not for some ship roaming around the seas at least.

And your bias is clearly showing again. You consider an internal crisis in Belarus a threat cause it could cause destabilization in 6 other countries (an obvious exaggeration) but oddly enough you're taking the fact that Turkey is drilling in Cyprus and is conducting research in the disputed EEZ with Greece with a military escort and you're dumbing it down to ""some ship roaming around the seas"". It's like you're trying to avoid the topic entirely. 

Greece going to war with Turkey is enough of a problem in itself. Way bigger one than how much Sweden would be affected by an internal clash in Belarus. You're trying to convince that other countries wouldn't be involved and maybe they wouldn't, but even if they didn't it would still be a major issue for the EU. France has very vocally supported Greece numerous times, even Germany has albeit with reluctance to do anything more but it doesnt even matter cause I was simply saying that Turkey's stance is destabilizing the area which is a fact. One that you're willing to avoid of course.. 

&gt;So that puts only Cypress and Greece against the rest of the norther Europe's interests

Aaaaand way into the interests of southern Europe. 

&gt;Now you have a hypothetical scenario where Greece would start a war over a red ship or people already dying in Belarus and a very real scenario of civil war and Russian joining in

People dying in Belarus is very sad but still an internal problem of Belarus as a non-member. If we can stop it we should but we should look to our own members that are way more directly affected, first. That would be Cyprus. The very real scenario even without the war is that Cyprus's resources are being stolen. Your scenario is still an imaginary one. Could happen, it it could not.

&gt;You know who used veto powers even if it wasn't their business to do so? Britain used veto for Euro currency policies even though they were not within it

Not sure what you're talking about. It's entirely Cyprus's business to use their veto power as a member. Britain left by itself. No idea what you're trying to say there.

&gt;But maybe there should be a limit of 1 veto a year and then they can drink ouzo the rest of the year.

Feel free to send an email to the parliament selling you proposal.

&gt;If what you have to say is important for the others, than you shouldn't be screaming

If that was the case then there would be no reason for a veto to exist in the first place. But it does cause the union is consisted of different countries with different views and interests. It's a way to make clear that you're not just objecting to something, you're stepping your foot down about it.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/iuuugh/eu_belarus_sanctions_in_doubt_as_cyprus_demands/g5uzrxb/,Divide-By-Zero88,1600548225

Turkey is not stealing anything. They are just scanning the area. Someone would call it a fake news ;).

Italy and Germany are totally against sanctions for Turkey. France has an other quarrel with Turkey and that is Libya. They would not go to war over Cypress. Not for some ship roaming around the seas at least. So that puts only Cypress and Greece against the rest of the norther Europe's interests. So the ratio of importance is 30 to 1 instead of 100 to 1. Now you have a hypothetical scenario where Greece would start a war over a red ship or people already dying in Belarus and a very real scenario of civil war and Russian joining in. 

&gt;That's exactly how politics work. Cyprus has the right to use its veto power and it does. 

You know who used veto powers even if it wasn't their business to do so? Britain used veto for Euro currency policies even though they were not within it. Didn't end up well for Britain. Maybe that is a sign for cyprus ;). I am well aware that there is no way of kicking out nations out of the EU. But maybe there should be a limit of 1 veto a year and then they can drink ouzo the rest of the year.

 did u ever read turkey's position and greece's demands? turkey hs the longest coastline in the mediterranean but greece wants all the sea and tries to give us a small zone which is against int law. turkey says lets meet and talk, lets see what both parts want and how can we solve this by law bur greeks dont want it because they now that they are not right.

4258,"From Wikipedia:

&gt; Given the complex history of the affected regions and the divergent interests of the victorious Allied powers, it is difficult to ascribe a definitive set of motives to the expulsions. The respective paragraph of the Potsdam Agreement only states vaguely: ""The Three Governments, having considered the question in all its aspects, recognize that the transfer to Germany of German populations, or elements thereof, remaining in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, will have to be undertaken. They agreed that any transfers that take place should be effected in an orderly and humane manner."" The major motivations revealed were:

&gt; A desire to create ethnically homogeneous nation-states: This is presented by several authors as a key issue that motivated the expulsions.

&gt; View of a German minority as potentially troublesome: From the Soviet perspective, shared by the communist administrations installed in Soviet-occupied Europe, the remaining large German populations outside postwar Germany were seen as a potentially troublesome 'fifth column' that would, because of its social structure, interfere with the envisioned Sovietisation of the respective countries. The Western allies also saw the threat of a potential German 'fifth column', especially in Poland after the agreed-to compensation with former German territory. In general, the Western allies hoped to secure a more lasting peace by eliminating the German minorities, which they thought could be done in a humane manner. The idea to expel the ethnic Germans was supported by Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden since 1942.

&gt; Another motivation was to punish the Germans: the Allies declared them collectively guilty of German war crimes.

&gt; Soviet political considerations: Stalin saw the expulsions as a means of creating antagonism between the Soviet satellite states and their neighbours. The satellite states would then need the protection of the Soviet Union. The expulsions served several practical purposes as well.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/ivvpo9/map_of_germanspeaking_areas_1910_and_post1945/g5ty9w7/,Sidorovich123,1600533482

4269,"Greek army is considering a new rifle to replace the old G3A3/A4 currently in use (7.62x51) and a similar debate exists between it and 5.56x45. One of the main issues with 5.56x45/.223 is that when this family of ammo started to be used in combat, it was done through rifles like the M16A1. The benefits over the heavier round are well recorded (lighter load for infantry, less recoil etc). Rifle evolution however led us from the 51cm M16 barrel to the 37cm of the M4 carbine. While stopping power is naturally reduced, body armor starts to become increasingly widespread and the carbine/5.56x45 has started to become unpopular among GIs. 
When it comes to the Greek case, the G3 rifle is a heavy bastard. In the A4 configuration and loaded it is 5kg and having this hanging from your shoulder gets annoying very quickly, so doing maneuvers with it is not a great joy (it is good for hitting with a bayonet however). On top of that when I was in the military I happened to be on guard duty inside an urban area using the G3. I couldn’t help but think how dangerous it would be should I ever need to shoot a rifle that could mutilate someone 400m away. A 5.56 carbine would
have been more preferable in both cases.
On the other hand when assuming defensive positions in our islands waiting for the Turkish invasion I wouldn’t want anything less powerful than the 7.62. 
So the answer to the question is, which ammo would I chose is “both”. I hope our army adopts a rifle that uses both configurations.",,/r/europe/comments/ivthi8/german_army_selects_haenel_mk_556_assault_rifle/g5tyjpd/,Kuivamaa,1600533629

4296,"Yes. It goes as far as economic Darwinism rejecting a welfare state. The idea is that the market regulates itself (which de facto isn't happening). ""The market"" exploits whatever it can and cares more about money than health, ecology, rights. It results in rich people having more influence and power and poor people are being abandoned and ignored.

Fascists can facilitate this since a lot of rich people do support fascism as long as they can keep doing what they're doing (Hitler was inspired by American fascism). Rich people as well as old nobility are funding fascists and always have done so. It is a well known fact that fascists and the rich are quite compatible. Both put very much value on being the elite. In fascism as well as in neoliberalism, you better be the elite to survive.

If I see a Belarussian flag, I immediately recognize it. If I see a flag with a blue stripe, a black stripe, and white on the bottom - I immediately know that it's the Estonian flag.

The colour palette of white and red is very common on flags - off the top of my head, I can think of Poland, Monaco, Indonesia, and Singapore that have very similar or identical designs to each other.

4440,"&gt;I'm claiming it, but I'm not trying to prove that. I don't expect to convince you of that.

The problem is that you're basing an inflammatory claim (""reduced safety is the result of immigration"") on something that you can't prove and thus don't know to be true, i.e. that the safety has actually been reduced. 

This isn't a philosophical debate, it's a political debate. Immigration isn't an imaginary process, it's movement of individuals across borders. We are talking about how the government and the public should view and treat those individuals.

You are in effect accusing them of reducing public safety, which is a very sensitive subject. And you are doing it without any proof that public safety has actually been significantly reduced.

&gt;My point was that the crime stats don't allow you to draw the conclusions about public safety in Germany that you would like to draw.

And my point was that while this statistic is imperfect, it's actually a good indicator and generally correlates with public safety. The conclusions I'm drawing from it are not proven facts, but they are reasonable conclusions from the available data.

And this brings me back to the above point: This isn't a game, we're discussing real people and things that have real influence on their lives. If you want to base accusations on the idea that extraordinarily circumstances exist which skew the available statistic, you better have proof that they really exist.

SD do have A LOT of racist &amp; volatile individuals in the party. I believe just a few weeks (or days?) a news-story broke of an group chat within SD where some party officials/members shared some pretty damning shit. Racist comments &amp; I believe a hitler salute and shit.

4490,"I am talking about its origins, not the literal brand/product. Its invention came from low cocoa supplies in Italy, following WW2, and pastry makers using hazelnuts to stretch what little they had as a result. 

The Wikipedia page you linked states “Pietro Ferrero owned a bakery in Alba, an Italian town known for the production of hazelnuts. In 1946, he sold the initial 300 kilograms (660 lb) batch of Pasta Gianduja, derived from Gianduja. Originally sold as a solid block, Ferrero started to sell a creamy version in 1951 as Supercrema gianduja.[5]”. 

That is exactly what I was referring to, and is the origins of modern Nutella, hazelnuts used to stretch cocoa supplies. Gianduja itself is older, but this mix in 1946 was the forbearer to the 1951 spread, that is what we now know as Nutella.

They're not fascists in the exact sense of the word, but they definitely share the same practices. Also, Antifa is certainly an organisation, they have levels of authority in group, communicate and work with eachother to attend/stage events, riots, etc. You wouldn't consider that organised? 

Especially when these are the same people attending multiple events.

4534,"That is correct. As if there was a permanent occupant that changed the composition of the population. The only major changes come from (1) the Slavs, who were in few hundred of thousands at most and were easily assimilated by the many millions of Roman Greeks (about 5-6 million in the Hellenic Peninsula in the 6th century AD), (2) the Arbanites Greeks from Arbanon which whom many Albanian descended to Greece and the most prominent one (3) the Anatolian Peoples who had been Hellenized though many centuries of Greek colonization, so much that more Greeks lived in Asia Minor than in Greece for the entirety of the Late Antiquity and the Medieval Era, who came to Greece in the 20th century AD. Other than this, the occupants either simply raided the area (Persians, Celts, Goths, Germans etc), assimilated peoples in remote areas who were later either reassimilated or excluded from the nation (like the Slav-Bulgars in Northern Thrace and Haemus, who became the Bulgarians and assimilated the Hellenized Thracian Romans and Greeks there) and of course the most obvious, the Turks who turkified and islamized Greeks, but those were excluded from the Greek Nation, hence it was an influx to the Turks instead of the opposite.",,/r/europe/comments/ivnqrv/pavlos_fyssas_greek_rapper_antifascist_activist/g5t3x36/,Lothronion,1600519501
