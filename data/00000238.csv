57,"&gt; On May 1, 1915, Pl√ºschow was sent to a prisoner of war camp in Donington Hall in Leicestershire.[2] On July 4, 1915, he escaped during a storm and headed for London. Scotland Yard issued an alert, asking the public to be on the lookout for a man with a ""dragon tattoo"" on his arm.

&gt; Disguised as a worker, Pl√ºschow felt safe enough to take souvenir photographs of himself at the London docks. He occupied his time by reading books about Patagonia, and at night he hid inside the British Museum.

&gt;For security reasons, no notices were published announcing the departure of ships, but a lucky encounter with another of his lady friends allowed him to obtain the information to board the ferry Princess Juliana, sailing for the neutral Netherlands. He arrived safely and finally reached Germany, where he was at first arrested as a spy since no one believed he could have accomplished such a feat.

I have no idea why they'd lobby against it.  It effectively acts as a huge wealth transfer from the German consumer to automakers, and those are probably going to be German automakers.  It forces German consumers to immediately buy new automobiles.

Maybe it's just for the sake of looking like they're upset.

The US had a similar program, the ""[Cash for Clunkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_Allowance_Rebate_System)"" thing, which was theoretically aimed at reducing emissions and probably in practice aimed at giving money to US automakers.  There, the ""will subsidize automakers"" bit was openly touted as a benefit, and it was paid for directly by taxpayers (rather than effectively creating a new tax for Germans that goes to automakers).

Wasn't actually very effective if that was the goal -- it wound up [mostly transferring market share from US automakers to Japanese auto manufacturers](https://qz.com/1042742/why-did-cash-for-clunkers-fail-a-new-paper-explains-how-obamas-stimulus-program-backfired/).",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8lod9h/germanys_second_biggest_city_is_starting_to_ban/dzh8pge/,vokegaf,1527125407

330,"&gt; That isn't true at all though. US and China are adversaries, they still have trade relations. We're not talking about open warfare or cold war style hostilities, trade is nowadays a tool by which one adversary tries to overpower the other.

They are only adversaries if you want to see them as such, outside of that context these are two sovereign countries who are at peace with each other and trading in the billions.
That why this ""adversary"" narrative is a wholly fabricated one, it is not confirmed by the economic realities.

&gt; Or maybe the systematic subversion - which is by now documented well enough on both sides of the Atlantic - is actually happening?

Again: Deflecting responsibility.
This type of ""foreign influencing"" has been going on for as long as adversaries, imagined and real, have existed [0].

&gt; It's not so much about people with different opinions existing, but understanding how people came to have these different opinions in the first place. 

How somebody came of an opinion is completely irrelevant, what matters is the validity opinion itself, anything else and you are pretty much just arguing ad-hominem, which is exactly what most of this has turned into ""Oh you disagree, you must be sitting in St. Petersburg!"".

&gt; And when you trace that back to its origin, it often seems to come from reading completely fabricated news articles or getting news from social media that can be traced back to the Russian government.

Got any concrete examples for that except for some Russian company buying Facebook ads in the US? Because actual data research does not confirm your notion that ""it all traces back to Russia"" [1].

If there's one thing that all members of the Europarliament hate, left or right wing, it's not being taken seriously. Critics often call them a fake parliament, and indeed a lot of power is still with national parliament, or with the European Commission. But they are not without power, and they love reminding everyone of that.

I'm almost certain that we'll see some kind of hostile action from the EU parliament towards facebook in the near future. A warning shot to Zuckerberg to make sure he's more polite next time.

In a way, Facebook is an easy target too. They are a foreign company, with no strong supporters. Everybody uses Facebook, sure, but that's not the same as supporting it. No one will feel sorry for them if their bottom line is hurt by a couple of billion.

345,"Just use common sense:

- do you agree that definition of ""poor"" changes over time ?

Yes. Outside of absolute poverty which is defined by starvation everything above it is entirely subjective and only can be described as difference between wealth around population rather than empirical unit you can measure.

- So being poor is mostly subjective ?

Yes. Polish poor family by standard of African family is VERY rich and they have issues with money because money they earn doesn't allow them to get kids to their peers level. Meanwhile if you would switch wealth between those African family would feel rich.

- So does incentives increase social status ?

Yes. IF you get around average pay just by virtue of having kids your social status will increase but so does EVERYONE else. Meaning that after novelty factor wears of your will be still in exactly same place and you will not have kids because again you would think that not giving kid a car for 18 birthday will be huge dishonor to you and you will think you are wrong parent.

- Can incentives became part of standard expectation ?

Yes. Novelty factor is just common sense. After a while people start to treat those funds as their fundamental right rather than incentive. Which means with what i said above about rising social status it will no longer factor same way as at start in trying to have kid.


And just to drive point home. My grandmother had 6 kids in 50 right after a war where there was no access to any healthcare, she didn't have car nor she had easy sitting job, she had to work hard on farm spending most of her days tending to animals.

And yet all of her children turned out fine nor she had any pressure from peers like today. Why ? Because back then everyone after war was at square one and there was mostly no difference between you and your neighbor.

Modern lack of children entirely comes from social pressure that is created by education. Meaning the more educated you are the higher your standards for ideal place for kid become and the more expensive process becomes.

So if some nation really wanted to boost their birthrate and make it permanent they should lower education and try to destroy difference between people wealth at least impact of it on human cognition and tracking of their social status.

According to the Committee of Ministers, hate speech covers all forms of expressions that spread, incite, promote or justify racial hatred, xenophobia, anti-Semitism or other forms of hatred based on intolerance

""other forms of hatred based on intolerance"" is the key part, and it's applied on many [example rulings on hate speech](https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Hate_speech_ENG.pdf) from the EHCR, including Leroy vs. France on condoning terrorism.

429,"Thank you for the respectful reply!

You brought up a topic that is key here, which is why hate speech and hate crimes were meant to protect vulnerable collectives ‚Äîsomething you deem irrelevant, when, well, it totally is relevant!

&gt;The only thing that I'm getting from this is that we go to radically different art events LOL.

I can't recall if it was exactly in the Armory Show of 1913, a century ago now, and the first modern art exhibition, that there was a piece consistant of a a chair, a shotgun, and a clock. You were free to sit on the chair and, at a certain given time, the shotgun would go off, effectively killing someone who chose to sit there.

Would that have been murder? Who knows, nobody sit in the end. But this happened a century ago, and modern art has done way weirder things since then.

That you don't attend or care for such art events is actually expected, as if you did it would mean you understand art better, and then you wouldn't be calling for jailing rappers.

&gt;I think everyone should be allowed to speak their mind and be free from prosecution as long as they don't incur into any of three things:

&gt;- Provable lies that cause a provable harm. If a journalist falsely accuses a teacher of being a pedophile, that teacher is never getting a job again. The law should help prevent that. This is common in all democratic societies.
&gt;
&gt; - Hate speech/inciting to violence. While some of the comments and lyrics the rapper made don't fit this point, some absolutely do. It doesn't matter if he's singing or talking. Try to make a nazi lyrics song in Germany, see where that gets you.
&gt;
&gt; - Attacks against national security. If you find out a police operative is working undercover and you publish this information on Twitter and get him killed, you should be accountable for that.
&gt;
&gt;That being said, this doesn't include some of what the rapper has said/sung. And it certainly doesn't include Willy Toledo's remarks, for example.

Well, law in theory does all that.

What you're avoiding, here, is the art discussion altogether, which was the main point.

But you present something interesting, which is that of hate speech as a [hate crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime). Hate speech and hate crimes are meant, in their origin as laws (which is quite recent), to punish actions that call for violence against **vulnerable collectives** that are susceptible to violence, particularly by reason of condition ‚Äîyou can read about that in the wikipedia link.

So, interestingly enough, there's little art for that and has an audience, in the world. Because, well, people ‚Äîand particularly artists, whom by definition require to have an enhanced sensitivity and certain talent and intelligence‚Äî aren't that shitty.

On the other hand, there's coincidentally plenty of art *all around the world* that has always called, not against vulnerable collectives, but against the different representations of power, in many different manners. Punk and rock have been about that, plenty. 

This goes to explain your repeated part when you said ""I don't see why it matters (if they're a minority)"". Well, it happens to be that, it does! 

&gt;What I'm asking for also happens in Germany, for inciting hate speech. I guess Germany isn't a democratic enough model then?

Hate speech, as argued, is meant to protect vulnerable collectives, not the monarchy, the police, or politicans.

Moreso, and tragically, when you insult someone who has indeed those kind of things in mind, then you're the one who gets prosecuted.

So, take Albiol, who can put in a political campaign ""Cleaning Badalona"" (of immigrants), and that's cool ‚Äîwhen it should be prosecuted as a hate crime‚Äî, whereas if you insult Albiol for doing that ‚Äîso that he doesn't get away with it‚Äî, you may end up being the one prosecuted for it!

Aboug Germany, if you can provide an example of people sentenced to jail for their lyrics in Germany that isn't about nazism or holocaust denial (which, as argued, they have a specific law for), that'd be an interesting read. 

In our country, it's the people that mock the dead fascists, that get prosecuted by the State, and not those that exalt them. One would argue that's quite a difference with the case of Germany.

&gt;I don't see why that matters. They're people. If anything, the argument is the opposite. They're people tasked with protecting you, and the least society can do is return the favour. Just my two cents.

Yet many times they don't do that, and certain collectives hurt particularly from it. And what should those collectives do, in your opinion, when they know of police that aren't clearly fulfilling their duty yet keep their jobs, and that aren't prosecuted for it? Shut up about it? Shut up about police brutaliy being a reality?

You get less of this speeches the better the democracy and the police forces, because then the lesser too the injustices that people will feel singing about. If you have shit forces, you get art denouncing it. It's actually quite easy to understand.

&gt;&gt;You can look up the recurring death threats that photo-journalist Jordi Borr√°s, or any other like him who specialises in covering the far-right events.
&gt;
&gt;But who made those?

Individuals and leaders.

Of course, leaders know better and shut up about it, they don't want to be found ‚Äîunlike rappers like these, that want to be heard the most and better.

I think you should already be seeing a pattern, at this point.

&gt;&gt;I understand you struggle with these because you're closer to the collective that gets offended.
&gt;
&gt;I'm sorry, what?

Well you clearly think that police's feelings are, no matter what, more important than someone's right to shit on the concept of police, so my only conclusion can be that.

If that's not the case, then it isn't.

&gt;&gt;A fascist political event is actually calling for bringing down the state and reinstate a fascist regime, go against certain vulnerable collectives by default: kill them, beath them, jail them, relinquish their properties; all because reason of race, religion, sexual orientation. It's what the ideology calls for.
&gt;
&gt;I have no idea what you're talking about here.

I'm pointing out the irony that, as long as you keep your mouth shut, you can be a very ill-minded person, full of hate towards people for what they are (and not for what they do). But if you happen to speak out about what you consider injustices, if you happen to denounce that there're some m*fuckers out there that we would be better without them in society (again, because of what they do, and not because of what they are) then you'll be prosecuted. And some people will do it knowing they'll be prosecuted ‚Äîthat being called dissidence.

So, the irony ‚Äîwhich you keep missing?‚Äî is that, in the end, the person who called out injustices is in prison, whereas the polite nazi is out there, doing his nazi things regularly.

493,"I had to read over your first sentence a few times before I got what you are saying, because the word ""claims"" has a number of meanings. I believe that you meant ""demands"". I agree with you, that the demands of Hammas are unlikely to be met and are unreasonable. Just as the demands of black separatists and the radical socialist or even communist black panthers were unlikely to be met during the civil rights movement. I guess if cooler heads had not prevailed, the United States too would have ended up with an armed African American insurgency, just as in the case of Isreal and the Palestinians. But the reason why the United States was able to get to where it is today (and it's hardly ideal, but much less brutal than the situation in Isreal/Palestine) is because those in power compromised. Not the black panthers. There was never a great turn around when the black panthers lay down their guns and shook hands with the Jim Crowe leaders. No. The compromise came from the side of the whites. White Americans tried to make things better for the blacks. They repealed Jim Crowe laws, they put affirmative action into place, they imposed forced integration. It was only due to the willingness of whites to compromise that Martin Luther King J., and not Malcom X, became the symbol of black civil rights. If MLK and his non violent protesters had been met with bullets, as have non-violent Palestinian protesters, then the US would be in the same situation as the Palestinian territories. It is in the hands of the Israelis alone to give light to the MLK of Palestine and not pour fuel  into the mouths of the Maclome X's of Palestine.

You blame Palestinians for the actions of Iraq, Egypt, Yemen, and all other Muslim countries. I presume that I, then, can blame Isreal for the actions of it's allies and distant relations too? In that case Isreal is even more at fault, for it was British imperialism which lead to the creation of the Palestinian territories in the first place, and the failure of middle eastern government.

Like the question ""Will you allow users to escape targeted advertising ?"" (Asked by the very angry guy)

That question is very vague and has many implications.

First, there's the question of what the advertising is targeted based on ? To their current session history ? To their age ? To their previous facebook history ? Even ads delivered by a random algorithm could be considered ""targeted"", since they have been (randomly) picked for that specific user.

Because a user may be on a facebook page that runs ads based on the content (e.g. the user is on a Second hand music instrument sales page and gets ads from Thoman or Fender), is that targeted ? 

The user may get ads from the people they follow (not facebook directly), are those ads ? Are those targeted ?

The user may get ads based on his age. Is that targeting ? and can you even legally escape that (e.g. show an ad for alcohol to someone under the legal drinking age in their country )

The user may get ads based on this location. Is that targeting ? And, if so, again, can you even disable that without getting into illegal territory (e.g. you can't legally advertise weed or gambling in Europe or alcohol in Sauid Arabia or Iran but you can in CA)

And these are the ""simple"" nuances of that question, that I understand and can easily explain, as a technical person who has worked on advertising systems.  I could probably go into 5 pages of detail just as to the corner cases of 'targeted advertising'. A lawyer that specialized on the subject would probably need 500 pages to fully explain the subject, it's not a simple question, it's a question made to seem simple to an audience which is not educated about it's subject.

And even assuming the question was simple. Zuc can't give an answer to a question like: ""Will you do this thing which may affect profit by a few billions a year ?"", because, guess what ?

There are democratic elements to the EU, for instance in the role of the directly\-elected European Parliament. But indisputably it is less clean than in many member state's national governments.

The argument that it is a good thing for citizens to have control and sovereignty over their own governments is the argument for democratic suffrage in general.

834,"I would put the brackets aroung ""English"".

Most people in Asia in Africa that are counted as understanding/speaking English speak in various kinds of pidgins.

It has been proven that lingua franca languages tend to evolve in their own ways. What we'll be seeing in the future is not uniformization (unless there's some kind of central authority), but rather the appearance of ""dialect chains"" based on english and other languages, like it's currently the case in some areas of Africa like Cameroon. Regions with other languages will keep their languages.

I'm pretty sure that's already the case btw. Two individuals in a remote area of GB and Cameroon will probably not be able to understand each other very well despite claiming to speak the same language. 

And ""above"" this dialectal continuum, there will be the ""classical"" lingua franca - english, mandarin, french, spanish etc... whose influence will depend directly on the relevance of each ""culture"" at a given time.

Those are distinct phenomenons, and it's very comparable to what happened to latin in the Roman empire. Latin (and latin ""pidgins"") started to form a dialect continuum, while classical latin and greek remained the languages of power. Once latin and greek weren't the languages of power anymore, they were replaced.

English will stop being the language of power once the elites don't speak English. But many people will still speak English and related languages. Those are two very different things and I think it's what this article is trying to show. It might seem counter-intuitive, but having more people speaking a certain language doesn't mean it has to be a ""world favourite"". It doesn't even mean that it has to remain.

890,"&gt; Some crazy dude named Nero burned their capital.

A lot of the stories you hear about Nero are entirely made up or exaggerated on account of his many political and personal enemies. He utterly disregarded the role of the Senate and governed as an autocrat, something that even Augustus didn't do before . So the Roman senators started to plant various rumors about him in his lifetime as well as afterwards, one of this being that he burned Rome. Rome was a 1+ million inhabitants city, with large chunks of it occupied by tightly packed wooden condos, so fire was extremely common. 

&gt;  A sinner city full of prostitutes and slaves got erased by a volcano.

Pompeii and Hercolaneum were no more full of prostitutes and slaves than any other Roman city. It was actually a small medium sized city for its time and a summer resort for the elite. 

&gt; They hated everyone who had just one god.

They didn't. Jews were able to thrive and only got punished when they rebelled against the Empire. As long as you recognised the Emperor as a divinity and partook ceremonies to honor him, you were fine. 

&gt; And they couldn't build curves, so all their stone build roads are straight or have 90 degree curves.

Funny that you mention it, when it is exactly the opposite. The Romans took the Etruscan arch to a new level and employed it in a lot of different building types, aqueducts, temples, basilicas, bridges, etc. I mean, the best preserved Roman building, the Pantheon, is a feast of engineering based on the curve! It was the Greeks that preferred to build in straight lines, although they certainly knew how to build curves, as the Mycenaeans prove.

The best source to the rescue:

The army of the late Republic that Augustus took over on becoming  sole ruler of the Empire in 30 BC consisted of a number of large  \(5,000\-strong\) formations called **legions, which were composed  exclusively of heavy infantry**. The legion's light infantry \([*velites*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velites)\) which had been deployed in earlier times \(see [Roman army of the mid\-Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_army_of_the_mid-Republic)\),  had been phased out as had its contingent of cavalry. Legions were  recruited from Roman citizens only \(i.e.: from Italians and inhabitants  of Roman colonies outside Italy\), by regular conscription, although by  88 BC, a substantial proportion of recruits were volunteers.

To remedy the deficiencies in capability of the legions \(heavy and  light cavalry, light infantry, archers and other specialists\), the  Romans relied on a motley array of irregular units of allied troops,  both composed of subject natives of the empire's provinces \(called the [*peregrini*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peregrinus_(Roman))  by the Romans\) and of bands supplied, often on a mercenary basis, by  Rome's allied kings beyond the Empire's borders. Led by their own  aristocrats and equipped in their own traditional fashion, these native  units varied widely in size, quality and reliability.

The other issue with Oxford and other collegiate universities as well is that you can damage your chances by applying to an over-subscribed college. *Anyone* applying to do Law at the most popular college (at the moment, bizarrely, it seems to be Brasenose) is going to have a harder time getting in that someone applying to a less popular college to do Fine Art! 

It's one of those difficult situations where any solution requires both top universities and schools to work together to:

&gt;a) encourage more kids from working class backgrounds or minority backgrounds to apply

&gt;b) present these universities as open and welcoming (which they are!) instead of out of reach

967,"&gt; The Roman Empire was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization

At least, that is an idea scholars nowadays hold. Contemporary Romans wouldn't know about that. To them the `imperium Romanum`had existed for quite some time. We might translate the term as ""sphere of Roman hegemony"", and it's consolidation happend after the second Punic war, that is ~200y before the republic ended.

Of course, when the republic actually ended is hard to say. It had been struggling all through the first century BC. We like to treat the rise of Augustus as the beginning of the empire, but the traditional distribution of powers had been gone since Cesar at the least, while the appearances of public (that is the people's) legislation only completely disappeared under Tiberius.

993,"Before anything, this will be 100% from memory, so forgive mistakes, although please do point them out:

-It was first a small kingdom near Rome, with two mythical origins: On one hand we have Romulus and Remus, and on the other the Eneid (I think, it is Eneida in Spanish). 

-Then they had 12 kings, each worse than the last, until people got fed up and rebelled, and installed a Republic in place of the monarchy

-Under the republic we see rapid growth, uniting italic tribes, kicking the Greeks out of the south of the peninsula, and the Roman Legions start to appear, unique in their proffessionality and structure of command, as well as an outstanding use of logistics, discipline and revolutionary tactics.

-We get not one nor two but **three** wars against Carthage, a regional power in the southern mediterranean. The first one ends up with a Roman victory after what is argually the biggest naval battle in history. The second one sees the Barcid family and specialy Hannibal Barca have some great results, with the conquest and/or alliances with a lot of the Iberian peninsula by the Carthagineans (including the founding of Carthago Nova, modern Cartagena), and a huge march on Rome, elephants included, and at least three crushing victories against the legions, specially in Cannae, where 4 (?) legions are anhilated. Hannibal ends up with a lot of logistical problems and can't attack Rome, Scipio the African attacks Carthaginean mainland which forces Hannibal to face him and be defeated at Zama. The third one ends with a complete destruction of Carthague, which leaves them quite salty (heh)

-The Roman republic expands through the mediterranean, conquering Greece (From whom they get all the culture and gods while prentending they are theirs) and the remnants of the Hellenic kingdoms like the Seleucids; France (whose conquest would finish Caesar) and Iberia (Whose conquest would finish Augustus). 

-Something something Two brothers something something failed proletarian revolution.

-Julius Caesar happens, almost gets crowned, but ends up assassinated, and a period of triunvirate and civil wars starts, with the most famous one being the one with Marcus Anthonius (? Marco Antonio in Spanish) who's fucking Cleopatra, someone else, and Augusts, which ends up with the creation of the proper **Roman Empire** at the hand of Caesar Augustus, and the anexation of the breadbasket of the Empire, Egypt.

-More expansions, Britannia is conquered, something something Teutoburg Forest something something damned barbarians, something something damned jews stop rebelling.

-As a side note, Hispania was a really important province (actually three, but you get me), with great metal, food and horse production, as well as providing great men for the armies and a few of the actually good emperors like Trajan, as well as writers and Historians. It becomes one of the most latiniced regions of the empire, despite resisting for about two centuries and having episodes like Numantia (trust me, check this out).

-Something called christianism appears among the slaves, they just ignore it untill it's too big to stop, and killing them only adds wood to the fire. Two emperors (Theodosius and his succesor) end up having to make it the official religion of the empire)

-The empire almost collapses in the third century because of even more civil wars.

-The empire stalls, more and more germanic tribes are let into the empire because they make for good legionaires, but they do not get properly latiniced, and are more loyal to the general than to Rome.

-This is a bad idea.

-A VERY bad idea.

-An emperor decides to divide the empire in two to make it more manageable, the Western Roman Empire (which gets Rome proper sacked in 456) and the Eastern Roman Empire (which is really cool and continues to exist until 1454 never forget Ottoman cannons cannot melt Theodosian walls, and which gets some cool emperors like Justinian and Alexios).

The only thing here bigger than the vocabulary of  English is your massive inflated ego. You're decent at English, I wouldn't say you're Shakespeare and I could tell you were an ESL speaker from your first sentence. What's next, you learn how to play chess and all of a sudden you'll go round telling everyone you're a grandmaster?

Unless you've actually studied the English language in depth, including its evolution, rarer words and phrases or have some knowledge of dialects I don't think you're the authority on it, can lecture on its strengths and weaknesses, or that anyone should give half a shit about your opinions to be honest. There are loads of things that other people would find stupid and needlessly difficult about the Polish language if they were SECOND LANGUAGE SPEAKERS and thus form the base structural framework of a sentence in the style of their mother tongue. Just because you're having a moronic hissyfit about how you are struggling and ""ugh, like being confined dude"" doesn't mean that's objectively true. It's a good way to sound like a pretentious cunt though, and you've shown everyone on here you lack the basic empathetic sense to even imagine yourself in someone else's shoes, even claiming that ""you don't remember what case to use, it's automatic"" - fucking Lmao if you were a second language speaker you would definitely have to remember what case to use.

----------------------------------------


I noticed a few things:

Despite only having half the length the German news broadcast crams in almost double the topics discussed. At the same time there isn't an incessant parade of talking heads giving commentary. The only person invited is a journalist giving his own take on a topic clearly marked as commentary. There aren't any lobbyists allowed to spread their spin. There isn't the constant ad for one's own website; only at the very end are website and further programmes mentioned, which go into more depth on international stories (*Weltspiegel*). Two of the *news stories* in the PBS broadcast were really ads for a startup and a book launch respectively. And finally: not a single one of the news stories in the PBS broadcast is solely international. The few non-domestic stories they talk about all involve American politicians or companies. 

I know that PBS is miles better than the other news organisations (I turned on CNN recently and I was genuinely shocked by the lack of actual content. When i was growing up in the 90s CNN was considered the gold standard of international news. And what I was watching was CNN International, the more news oriented version, too...) but I still find it horribly commercialised and not intent on actually educating its viewers on what is going on around the world.

Then there is line 9 - total number of citizenship certificates issued by migration service by whatever reason, which is 22 thousand.

After that you have lines 44 and 35 - number of people with permanent (14 thousand) and temporary (33 thousands) residence permits.

1168,"Since 2006, Eurostat has been carrying out the Land Use and Coverage Area frame Survey \(LUCAS\) every three years. LUCAS is used to identify changes in land use \(for instance, agriculture, forestry, recreation or residential use\) and land cover \(for instance crops, grass, broad\-leaved forest, or built\-up areas\). 

You may discover that some 4&amp;#37; of the land in the European Union is covered by man\-made surfaces such as built\-up areas. This represents over 180 000 km2, which is roughly equivalent to twice the area of countries such as Hungary or Portugal. Compared with the size of the population, this means that in the EU there is nearly 370 m¬≤ of non\-natural land per inhabitant.

Almost a quarter \(23.7&amp;#37;\) of Malta‚Äôs land is covered by artificial surfaces. As such, Malta has the highest proportion of land covered by man\-made surfaces. Malta is followed by the Netherlands \(12.1&amp;#37;\), Belgium \(11.4&amp;#37;\), Luxembourg \(9.8&amp;#37;\) and Germany \(7.4&amp;#37;\). In contrast, 2&amp;#37; of or less of the land is covered by artificial surfaces in Latvia, Finland, and Sweden \(all 1.6&amp;#37;\), Bulgaria \(1.8&amp;#37;\) as well as Estonia \(2&amp;#37;\).",Bucharest,/r/europe/comments/8lhjtw/eu_proportion_of_manmade_surfaces_is_the_highest/dzflmw4/,B0etius,1527061385

Rather try short I vs long EE as in `pit` - `feet` for the Finnish I vs II. Although the two examples in English don't exactly have the same vowel in, it's a much closer approximation than `ship` vs `sheep`, where length has nothing to do with the difference. The same goes with:

Well, they were not exactly against slavery for a long time, but now the church doesn't really spend a lot of time defending the institution of slavery.

The bible is against being unfaithful too. Have they decided to just throw in the towel on that one and focus their disapproval at a smaller, more vulnerable group?



Is god still against wearing clothes made of two fabrics? Or was that the old testament god/jesus?

Is there any particular reason why ""dƒìofles"" isn't used?

Whose term is ending in 2 years. You still have all of EU + GB + Turkey on your side even without US. 

&gt; that would be what ussr did

No. Union of Sovereign States ended before being started partly because of Western help. We would keep most of our territory with loyal citizens had West not given Ukraine's and Belarus' president chance of cooperation and trade. They would not leave if they had nowhere to go. Unfortunately, they were given the choice. And Boris was an tard anyway. 

&gt; what do you mean

Regression started before 1991. Economy was already in shit position in 1981 And afgan worsened everything.

&gt; why does Russia have special consideration

Because we have no choice. NATO and especially US will be hostile in every situation and we have to stop their expansion. Failure to do this will result in our destruction.

Moldavia is not in EU. I say that our plan is working as intended.

Also in reality. They are already doing in in Kharkov, Odessa with discriminatory language and TV laws. Crimea would require harsher actions, just like Donbass.

Swedish. Like really strange english, with few new sounds, loads of loadwords and lots of conjugation. It's quite clear that swedes went for world science in the old days with all the connections to english, latin and german.

Norse. Twice as funky as swedish with half of sounds having different nature with many original words for things. If swedish was the guy living in metropolis, norse is his brother living in countryside.

Danish. Its like talking norse with a hot potato in your mouth. \(this is a folk joke.\) Pretty much anything from and between the other two. You will start by learning how to use your mouth again. This is father of swedish and norse living in woods who is always drunk.

Icelandic.

How about increasing the threshold of absolute poverty? We are certainly expanding what we consider 'absolute poverty' because our world is becoming better and people expect more from life.

You can fix relative poverty (income inequality) and still all be equally poor. You could be stuck living with 15th century technology and have no income inequality. Would that be better in your opinion? 

I'd rather live with 25th century technology and have income inequality, because I expect that people that are above the 'absolute poverty' level with 25th century technology will still have better lives than average people today.

Why do I bring up technology from different times? Because often when you interfere with market forces you make the situation worse. You might get rid of the problem you had, but will create a bunch of other problems. We usually see it with government regulation creating more barriers to entry and stifling innovation. Just look at the taxi industry - they were regulated by the government and this kept innovation away.

1518,"&gt; Trump campaigned on this, he promised that he would cancel the deal and won the election that way.

That doesn't add much to the understanding of the matter. Just because a certain minority of Amerians who bothered to vote were under the impression that pulling out the deal was a good thing doesn't mean it's good policy. It may or it may not be, but following through with it at any rate, you will have to face the consequences of your policy decisions is all I'm saying. And as of now, they look increasingly grim.

And notice how I'm not even suggesting the TPP was a good thing to begin with. It's debatable, to say the very least. But no matter how you see it in terms of its substance, it's indisputable that American influence in the Pacific has waned since pulling out of it. 

&gt; why should the USA, which is still the world largest economy

It isn't. [China is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)), followed by the EU. US comes in third. Do you recognise a pattern here?

&gt; bound itself in a multilateral agreement like this? 

Because that's the usual way of bringing multiple interested parties to agree on something?

&gt; You may not like this, 

Firstly, you don't know. Secondly, it doesn't even matter what I like or don't like. 

&gt; but the USA still have the leverage to cancel it and come up with better terms.

You might think so. But the capacity to bring other parties to the negotiating table and convince them that they're better off dealing on *your* terms is diminished every time you just leave the table, retreat to the mainland and thereby give those other parties the opportunity to come up with designs of their own which will eventually replace and supplant the international structure the US have been building for the better part of eight decades.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8l52c5/eu_to_approve_free_trade_negotiations_with/dzey2fd/,ColourFox,1527031505

1529,"I actually saw that a while ago. Funny how you take only the message you like, but ignore the message like this ""intelligence differs withing groups to such a degree that you cannot treat individuals differently based on appearance"" since you make claims about Romas in general to quote you:
&gt;So no matter what schooling the Roma will always be Roma

Also the initial commentator, not Sam Harris (who is smarter and probably more logical) starts with some logical fallacies declaring ""it makes absolutely no logical sense for groups... completely different in terms of physical externalities..."" 

First of all, groups of people are not completely different, different shade of skin color is not that important. Second, the color of the skin is not a sign of genetic difference, there are more differences among different group of black people than between me a white dude and a black North African, not to mention South Asians or Romas.

&gt;According to Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, ""From a scientific point of view, the concept of race has failed to obtain any consensus; none is likely, given the gradual variation in existence. It may be objected that the racial stereotypes have a consistency that allows even the layman to classify individuals. However, the major stereotypes, all based on skin color, hair color and form, and facial traits, reflect superficial differences that are not confirmed by deeper analysis with more reliable genetic traits and whose origin dates from recent evolution mostly under the effect of climate and perhaps sexual selection""

Read a bit more about such ""differences""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_genetics#Between-group_genetics

&gt;Kaplan therefore concludes that, while differences in particular allele frequencies can be used to identify populations that loosely correspond to the racial categories common in Western social discourse, the differences are of no more biological significance than the differences found between any human populations (e.g., the Spanish and Portuguese).

Races have more cultural significance than anything, if there are differences between races they are mostly due to differences in culture and social-economical situation. Even Sam Harris uses a crap-shot approach and claims that genetics account for 50-80% differences in IQ (remember he talks about *genes*, not necessarily ""race"") and that means that 50% if the lower number is correct is accounted by environment. I think it's a mistake to talk too much about racial differences, it's pointless, it's probably incorrect, and it's harmful for all the people of a specific race, even the ones who as pointed in the video should not be treated as a group (but that's not the message that you seem to vibe with).

1579,"I'm an actual Armenian and I'll tell you this guy is the real deal. He's being referred to as the nation's hero by probably 95\+&amp;#37; of the country. The HHK party\(Republicans\) in charge have a support base of 3000 people max if you count their families and extended beneficiaries. Literally, the only people supporting them are those who benefit from their corruption. This revolution to us isn't a question of East vs West or anything of that sort. Its simply a power grab by the people from a corrupt few who have set up a fake government. Everything about it was fake starting from their support base and ending with their ""policy changes"". No laws were followed by the governing people. The laws they approved were only to be followed by the ""average folk"". 

Now, it has all changed. Mr. Pashinyan has gone down in the book of the Armenian nation as a hero. David vs. Goliath kind of story. He is now known among us as the savior of the nation.

Also, allow me to mention that he advocated for revolution through civil disobedience and other non violent alternatives. He's even said that there should be no vengeance or vendettas. He's not advocating for oligarchs to abandon their businesses and flee the country. He's been saying they should stay and instead of trying to make money through illegal means, they should focus their financial means on actually becoming and staying competitive to survive in the ever changing business atmosphere. He wants them to abide by legal standards in any industry they do business. Another thing he has said is that businessmen should not be allowed to be politicians. He's said ""if you want to make money, be a businessman not a politician"". With all due respect, he is absolutely correct. Politicians job is to serve and represent the people not to make money. 

So far, he's been giving the Armenian public daily reports by way of facebook live videos updating us on his every move and letting us know what he's done that day. He's advocated for transparency and has gone as far as showing us where he will be living\(where ex prime minister lived\) and where he will be working. Everything he's done by far has been very positive. He's even said that if at any moment the people feel hes not representing them correctly, he will step down.

Each of them is like a regional centre as they also conveniently each ""grab"" a corner of the country. However, their welfare varies a lot. The capital is the wealthiest, followed by Tartu. P√§rnu is also not far behind, but Narva is one of the poorest towns of the country.

Then we have what we know as the more relevant small towns, like [Kuressaare](https://kodukoht-kuressaare.weebly.com/uploads/1/9/9/8/19985495/448936654_orig.jpg?488) (pop 13 000, the capital of Saaremaa island), [Viljandi](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2210/2290374941_1c6af3322c_b.jpg) (pop 17 000), [Rakvere](https://i.imgur.com/d4RM4tt.jpg) - (pop 16 000) [holy shit I literally had to upload my own image from last summer due to not finding a decent picture of the town]. These are some of the quintessential Estonian small towns, centuries old with historical medieval old towns, churches etc. I'd say they are more or less okay, but definitely not as wealthy as Tallinn or Tartu. Still, many find them charming and peaceful alternatives.

Even smaller towns are usually even worse off, but it really depends. If they are near Tallinn, they might be wealthy. There are also a few Soviet-era monoindustrial towns that have become complete [ghost towns](https://p.ocdn.ee/17/i/2017/6/12/3fvku4mt.ure.jpg) in the North-East.

The issue is : this relationship has deteriorated over the past few decades.

For instance, when doing their bachelor in Quebec, french people pay as much as non quebecers canadians currently while 10 years ago, they paid as much as quebecers.

Back then a lot of people went to Quebec for their studies.

Now, people simply prefear Spain when going aboard for their studies and thus are likely to stay there instead.

The US and it's allies allies managed to get compromise a solution much to the chagrin to the hardliners in Iran who wanted the sink the deal. Now Trump just validated them. It was all done in the name of undoing the things that Obama administration did. 

If Trump really cared about getting Iran to stop its other activities, then he would set his policy towards achieving those other seperate goals in Iran. He didn't. Why? Because it was never about that.

In case you haven't realized it, Trumps whole foreign policy is about shooting from the hip to achieve short aims and approval rating without thinking towards the long term.

Russian history has always been about dreaming to be like the west. Peter the Great came somewhat close by copying my country, but even his legacy has been long gone, except for the Dutch architecture in St. Petersburg.

Russians will always be on their own. Not asian. Not european. Not because no one wants them; no. Its because you guys are obsessed with war and agression.

You think you will earn respect for violating international law. We see it as pathetic. A prove that Russia, as always, is living 1-200 years in the past compared to Europe.

Good luck with Crimea. Its not like it will get you a position on the world stage. You did succeed in being relevant from 1940-1990. Thats 50 whole years. You did so by opression millions of people and killing millions of people. You brought nothing but destruction and suffering so your pathetic nation was slightly bigger on a world map. Yet again what did it bring your generation? Nothing but irrelevance, poor economy and a tyranical government.

And you will never accept that. You will never say that what i write here is the truth. Because youre Russian. And Russians somehow like it when children, women and men alike suffer.

In this particular case we also have the problem that often antisemitism is put on the same rung as antizionism. There is a good reasons for doing that and not doing that. On one hand there are Jews who are heavily opposing Israel, on the other hand there are Jewish communities referring to themselves as Israeli communities, such as the one in Nuremberg (Israelitische Kultusgemeinde N√ºrnberg), to bring up an example close to home. It's not that easy and of course it's an emotional subject, but I'll stick with it: If there was no hate in their intentions, then it should be seen as criticism and I'd definitely put this bit into that categories, though some will find it offensive.

2006,"Yes, 80% of the Dutch population is ‚ÄúDutch‚Äù, which is qualified as ‚Äúliving in the country for at least one generation.‚Äù Hardly a qualifier for ethnic homogeny. If we go by these rules, most countries in Europe, with both bad and good infrastructure systems, could he ranked as ehtnically homogenuous, ruling ethnicity out entirely as factor.

The US might have a higher per capita income, but this is mostly caused by statistical outliers (aka billionaires) that the US has a lot of, inflating it‚Äôs GDP immensely. Looking at income inequality, US ranks 63rd amongst inequality in countries. The Netherlands ranks 143rd, Japan 123rd, and Switzerland 117th. All three well ahead of the US.

Like another user has pointed out, ethnic homogeny doesn‚Äôt even seem to correlate with infrastructure quality. Italy and Portugal are quite homogenuous, but have lacking infrastructure.

I have taken the liberty of calculating the average performance of infrastructure systems (by the logistics performance index) of the top 10 least diverse countries on the Fearon list (a list that ranks countries by their ethnic diversity) to see how they would perform. It comes in at about 3,64, assuming Yemen and North Korea have average performing infrastructure systems, which they almost certainly do not. 3,64 ranks about 25th worldwide. Not bad, though that‚Äôs below the likes of diverse countries such as South Africa and the US.

In other words, ethnicity seems to have no (or at least very little) cause in the quality of infrastructure. If wealthy but diverse India would deport all its minorities, I think you would not see much of a jump in government efficiency. 

EDIT: As an addendum, you do appear to be right in that the Netherlands aren‚Äôt very ethnically diverse at all, at least by the metrics I am using. It would seem that I had an incorrect view thanks to the many alarmist politicians popping up warning us about growing ethnic diversity whereas on the large scale it doesn‚Äôt seem to play much at all.

2033,"&gt; You mean that symbolic thing they did?

They later said it was symbolic, in front of the judge. They threatened with it during the referendum (which was one of the reasons the issue escalated). They never said it was during the big moment. Probably because they did not expect it to fail so miserably at an international level. They can't ""it's just a prank bro"" this out.

&gt; Any politician has to take decisions that will not be shared by 100&amp;#37; of the population. That's not denying the existence of the ones that thing different than you.

There is a difference between that and deliberately omitting half of your population. Specially in life-changing decisions like the independence of a region.

&gt; What I see in Spain is that all regions have the level of autonomy they demand except Catalonia, which for some reason is not considered mature enough to govern itself.

All regions have the same autonomy, which is more than actual federal states. The issue is that what Catalonia demands now does not give a damn about the rest.

&gt; Stop this bullshit. Other countries would have never allowed the situation to escalate like that. Just look at how Denmark, Canada and UK handled similar situations.

Germany has banned referendums regarding Bavaria. In Portugal and France independentist parties are forbidden. In Italy referendums can be done regarding autonomy, but not independence.

&gt; If I'm not wrong, that 'middle point' was Estatut 2006 which was destroyed after being approved in a referendum. Since 2006, Catalan society has moved a lot on demanding more autonomy, so the middle point is probably no longer the Estatut, but some kind of federal state.

The 2006 Estatut had abhorrent rules like making Catalonia have a veto on any decision regarding the whole of Spain and Catalonia having a fixed part of the budget for all regions regardless of the circumstances. It would have made other regions second-rate compared to them.

As I said, Autonomous Communities have already more autonomy than federal states. You cannot have all the advantages of being within Spain and then no responsibilities.

- False. Alberto Fabra doesn't. And you say ""all"" while you're speaking actually about 3 guys: Zaplana, Olivas and Camps. Fabra was also from the PP and a Valencian president, but he is not involved in any case either.

Alberto Fabra is not involved in any corruption case, [he was defeated, yes, but by the polls](http://www.elmundo.es/grafico/comunidad-valenciana/2016/09/13/57d7f1c8268e3e6f5f8b45d9.html). 
Since he lost his presidence because 3 parties unified against him (el tripartito). You can Google ""Alberto Fabra corrupcion"" to check it.

Because Fabra has an image of ""Espa√±ol de pelo en pecho"" , that Bert√≠n Osborne style, was the only and real reason to compare him to corruption but in reality he was fighting the corruption of the Valencian PP (which is normal since he was trying to clean their image) and he hasn't been implied in any corruption case.

Also, IIRC, he apologized to anyone who those tweets and articles may have offended, but when asked by Domenech whether those were still his views, he had a hard time saying they weren't. If he wasn't a career politician at the time, I guess it's kind of excusable. But, personally, I would not want someone with those views to preside over anything. Don't know about you.

It's as if he's going to last anyway. My only guess is that they wanted to burn him already.

Well, the alleged left jumped on the bandwagon, Pedro S√°nchez calling him a racist, so yes it's pretty mainstream at this point.

About Losantos, no, but media and the State powers consistently ignore aggressions on one side, while they make a big deal of any little thing happening on the other.

And there's nothing in sight that points out this dynamic is going to make a 180¬∫ turn, more on the opposite, people will be voting Ciudadanos which are harshest than PP on these matters.

&gt;I just saw one person make fun of the family online, on Men√©ame, and it was downvoted to hell. That's fucking stupid people. I'm not sure how widespread it was in other places, but I resent that you say ""many Spaniards"". First, it sounds like it is actually ""many"", which I doubt. And second, it sounds like it's only ""Spaniards"" (meaning not Catalans). I'm sorry people are insensitive pieces of shit, but you are implying none of those harassers are Catalans (which I don't think you can prove) and that they are many, effectively creating a depiction of Spaniards suitable to your discourse. That's not nice. :(

Unfortunately, I have to judge Spain through their political representatives, and seeing how Ciudadanos is going up, and how these people are all Ciudadanos voters, yes I have to say they're plenty.

There's a thing which is based on simple numbers. For every independentist, there're 20 Spaniards. For every shitty Catalan, of which there're as much as everywhere else, there're 20 shitty Spanairds against him.

I mean, we're outnumbered and that's that, we're a minority. One would argue this should be a reason for calling for protection, but what happens instead is that they have a free pass at attacking us, and we have to withstand such attacks in an stoic way.

We all hurt from these people, but it's really not up to Catalans to fight them. The only party that does so is Podemos, and they're not going to be relevant in National Politics anytime soon, if ever. So in that sense we're powerless, as the parties that benefit from this kind of discoruse are the ones that are going to rule the country the last decade for a minimum.

In my opinion any separatist movement in current europe is simply bonkers, its not like Catalonians are being enslaved or oppressed.

Therefore I dont know what methods could be used to achieve such a bonkers goal, but Im quite sure that the sacrifice and determination is the key element. What could work in our times? Probably increasing power of catalonians, through wealth and education, building up the influence with the sole purpose of the independence goal. And then the readiness to risk it all for the purpose.

There are no conditions to do that. As I said, there is very little motivation for doing it in EU. If Spain would overtaxed you and snatch your children and make them work in coal mines, then maybe. People will not gather the necessary motivation to really fight, there is simply nothing to fight for, really.

Genocide =/= killing members of a group.

As long as your intent is the destruction of the group itself, you have committed a genocide. In fact the original idea of genocide included the group being destroyed by any means, including destruction of their identity, language, culture - however the final legal adoption excluded those and only includes acts against the physical *group* (in fact only includes 5 acts which are listed in article II of the convention) - but it helps to know the original idea in order to understand what genocide is about. Two of those acts actually have nothing to do with killing people: Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. You can commit a genocide without killing one single individual if you only do any of those two things.

2321,"Translation

When relations between Europe and the United States are in poor condition, Poland has no other option but to skillfully maneuver.

The discrepancy report between America and Europe has been swelling since the beginning of Donald Trump's term. It started with the climate policy that was being lowered by the White House, a rather one-sided vision of the peace process in the Middle East and the promotion of the American LNG at the expense of the German concept of Europe's dependence on gas from Russia. Then came the issue of planned duties on many goods imported from the EU, and finally the US terminated the nuclear agreement with Iran. As a result, the magazine Foreign Policy began to wonder whether the American-European alliance will survive, the German ""Der Spiegel"" announced its end, and Donald Tusk in last week in Sofia stated that having such friends, no enemies are needed. The twilight of transatlanticism ceased to be merely a concept from political science and became a fact.

As Marcin Zaborowski, former director of the Polish Institute of International Studies, argues, Trump brought a new quality to American politics: hostility towards Europe. The old continent, however, did not remain indebted. Already during the election campaign in the US two years ago, many influential EU politicians explicitly advocated Hillary Clinton, indicating that Trump is not a partner for them. As a result, transatlantic relations began to resemble the nineteenth-century concert of the strongest players, which for Poland means losses and pushing for peripheral positions.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Read also: Parafianowicz: Can the US stop paying off [OPINION]

Until now, our security was based on two pillars: economic - EU, and military - Euro-Atlantic.

- The time is approaching when this division will not be so obvious. The definitions of who is an ally at the moment, and who is not conducive to the position of Poland, become liquid. This also applies to the US, with whom it was always supposed to be only good - comments in an interview with DGP one of the government's members dealing with international affairs.

- The authorities of Poland face a difficult choice - adds Aleksander Smolar, president of the Stefan Batory Foundation. In his opinion, the desire for close relations with the US, and at the same time an economic burden towards the EU, means that it would be best to adopt a waiting position.

No one requires us to advocate a party today, but on certain issues it is impossible to lie down for a long time. For example, regarding the placement of the Polish embassy in Israel, after Washington's decision to move to Jerusalem. Similarly, the risk of weakening NATO by a stronger involvement in European defense structures, promoted by France.

For the time being, the Polish government is trying to act in this way, which was especially visible after the very balanced reaction of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Jacek Czaputowicz to the US's termination of the agreement with Iran. - In such matters, as well as in the matter of Israel, it would be best not to take sides on any side and keep neutrality as long as possible - says prof. Tomasz Grosse from the University of Warsaw.

For the moment, on Israel case seems to be tilting towards the European side. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not hear about the plans to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem - even if countries from our region seen as US allies have already declared such a desire as Romania.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Read also: Women in the United States give birth to fewer and fewer children. In addition to one surprising group

Marcin Zaborowski indicates that the priority for Polish diplomacy should be solidarity with the Union in economic and commercial matters. This means support for efforts to maintain an atomic agreement with Iran. The expert draws attention to the fact that although there are mainly Western European companies operating there, there is nothing to prevent the interests of domestic companies from doing so, not to mention the diversification of oil supplies and liquefied gas.

PESCO, a constant cooperation in the field of defense, is such an initiative on the EU forum. But seeing what pain is being born in, Paris pushes non-EU forms of European military cooperation. As Aleksander Smolar points out, Warsaw's involvement in such initiatives is in the interest of Poland, if only because in the future the Union may surprise conflicts that threaten its neighborhood, but not necessarily in which the United States will want to join.

Warsaw has a fundamental cause for concern when America and the Union are together not on the way: Russia. One of the paradigms of the Kremlin's actions is the weakening of the West, and one of the ways to achieve this is the weakening of the transatlantic ties. As he commented on Moscow's perspective on what is currently happening on the Washington-Europe line, the head of the Bundestag's foreign affairs committee Norbert R√∂ttgen: ""Putin alone can not believe his luck.""

- From the Kremlin's point of view, this is a no-brainer [something you do not need to think about - ed.]. The crisis in transatlantic relations not only breaks the West, but also pushes the Russian budget dependent on oil revenues - says Zaborowski.

2322,"In Britain, like most everywhere else, quietly drinking beers on the train is basically a national pastime.  It's *technically* not allowed, but everyone fucking does it and no one ever complains about it unless you're acting like a lairy douche.

Next, when the beer drinking defendant accuses the English guy of also being drunk, the English guy does not refute this  and only says ""well at least I'm not drinking on the train"" (which again...everyone fucking does)

This is why i think this kind of post should give more informations instead of simply ""this in 1900 and this in 2000"". Because comparing the situation of a hundred years without taking any step is plain stupidity in my opinion. Events happens, war happens, political, climatic events happens. There could be tons of cause here. So yes, here the post war emigration can be concluded by most but i think the process of comparing informations here is not good enough.

2491,"I'm going to give a more levelled response. 

English does have three (originally put one by mistake) grammatical case but it is so simple you probably would never notice it. It is as simple as adding an 's at the end of a word to denote possession. Surely you don't have to think when applying the possessive? For speakers of languages with more complex grammar the same is true, it's just instinctive. 

Also, many English words do have case, most obviously pronouns. Think about the difference between I and Me; or She and Her. You would never have to think about it because it's your native language and that's what native languages are like.

English is very rigid because we cannot explicitly convey what the function of a word is without using a set word order. It should also be noted that case systems are not at all rare and are spoken more widely in Europe than those without a case.

Right now we are still not completely certain that we can build fusion reactors with a stable reaction.

You don't, you use the same word, just in different case.

&gt;boy shoots girl

What if you want to say the same, but you first think of the girl (the victim)? In a language with cases you say it exactly how you think it: girl(Akk.) shoots boy(Nom.). In English you can't, you literally have to process the entire sentence first in your brain, shuffle the words around and only then you can actually say it and not even in the form you wanted to.

2567,"&gt;I was merely parodying your hostile sentence structure with my response.

For parody to work you have to actually have a point, you have none. The fact that you don't realize this, proves even further that you are of substandard intelligence.

&gt;because you're not a native speaker

Wrong. Every language has preferred speaking order. And Polish one is actually exactly the same as English one (SVO). So I have no problem whatsoever with that aspect. But there is quite frequently a need to change it up and you simply can't do it with standard English grammar.

&gt;And ""badly needed?"" Please give an example of when it's ""badly needed"" to use a different order, but you can't. 

HAHAHHA. I already gave one, the fact that you can't comprehend it is your problem.

&gt;especially because I gave you a way of still saying ""girl"" first (if you insisted on it).

No, you didn't. Firstly your pathetic attempt was made by an edit after I already commented. Secondly ""girl shot by boy"" is not a sentence, it's a noun phrase.

&gt;And no, thinking ""girl"" first and being upset you can't say ""girl shoots boy"" doesn't constitute ""badly needed,""

Yes, it does. I want to say things the way I think them, without the need to process the whole sentences first. There can be for example a situation when someone's asking you: ""Who shot that girl?"". In a more sophisticated language you can already start answering ""That girl (Acc) shot ..."" while thinking about the answer and then add ""John (Nom)"" to form a perfectly valid sentence ""That girl (Acc) shot John (Nom)."" You can't do this in English at all.

And finally I haven't even mentioned the fact that the need for changed word order is so great that you yourselves frequently use it, even though it makes no grammatical sense in English. Sentences like ""That I don't know"", ""There it is."", ""With this ring I thee wed"" or even ""Thee I love"" are common examples.

Because lead is not naturally very abundant in the atmosphere, fluctuations in the concentration of lead in the ice could be linked with human activity. In particular the smelting of impure silver tended to kick up a lot of nasty fumes that carried lead around.

&gt;We studied the genetic ancestry of 5,269 self-described African Americans, 8,663 Latinos, and 148,789 European
Americans who are 23andMe customers and show that the legacy of these historical interactions is visible in the genetic ancestry of present-day Americans.

This is interesting but I question how reliable is this sample as a representation of the total population; this is not a random sample, but just people that are 23andMe customers.  

Having said that, the European admixture of self-identified White Hispanic is close to what I have heard from other sources about the same group in Latin America proper.   However, I found the 65.1% for all Hispanic Americans really high compared to Latin America given that no racial group in the region gets to 40% of the total.

Do you know how you can control what files a website puts onto your computer?

THROUGH YOUR BROWSER SETTINGS.

If you rely on **ANYTHING** that needs to be offered by the website ""legally"" then you are **NOT** safe.

I'll give you an analogy: the cookie law is like requiring a robber to announce that they're a robber. A website that is doing this tracking maliciously is not going to tell you that they're tracking you. If said website is made outside of the EU then there's nothing that can be done about it. You take these two points and add them together to find that you shouldn't rely on the website telling you whether they track you or not. 

There's good news though! It turns out that your browser *can* tell you this information and can even control this information. You don't have to rely on the website itself to do it for you.

In other words: we already had the ability to restrict when cookies were being used and had the ability to know when they were used as well. The EU law made no difference there.

* Every country in Latin America has a significant percentage of the population that is of Spanish ancestry

Okay, so we turn off the oil taps tomorrow then, since it's so bad. Europe, just transition your energy grids over the summer, should be easy. 

Realistically speaking here, our customers are mostly junkies, and some might die if we stop feeding them. We have to wait until atleast Europe has transitioned it's energy grid and transportation into alternatives, lest Europe will occupy us and turn them on again anyway.

What's really unsettling when thinking about climate change is that Europe has now absurdly settled on using gas as a transition from oil to renewables. For those who don't know, this gas is basically the same as oil, even found in the same wells and have about the same climate warming potential. Quite absurd. We should use a trillion EURO on developing completely new, sustainable, cheaper and better infrastructure for all of us. Europe as a continent could easily achieve that if we really want it.

[1/2]

So, the main topic first:

&gt;But anyway, differences aside, why the hell did puigdemont choose that guy? 

Nobody truly knows.

The more realistic answer is that he's someone who he may trust as loyal and reliable, a close friend of sorts.

The big question is more: Why did they do this, knowing this would backfire?

One thing that comes to mind, and that has been a pattern, is that, in a really hilariously, ironic way, taking into account the subject, we have always been expecting better things from Spain. As in, I can picture them pondering the potential repercussion of his tweets or articles, and saying ""some media will be harsh about it, but that's going to be all"". I know it sounds dumb, we may as well be that dumb, but it's one of the few explanations that come to mind. As I said, this has been a pattern, as the reactions from Spain at every step of this whole ordeal have always been super reactionary ‚Äîi.e. framing as terrorists people for peaceful protests. Alas, if we don't always give Spain that chance, we're pictured as crazy radicals, so we're constantly between a stone and a hard place when it comes to dealing with such a power as Spain is ‚Äîin comparison to us, who are a mere autonomous community, no different than any other.

Nonetheless, it's worth noting that this was the end of the line of around 5 months of processes in trying to get a better candidate in, regardless of independentists having won the elections. No Puigdemont (they rejected a telematic law, which was left as last resource), no Jordi S√°nchez (regardless of the UN call), and no Jordi Turull (who was going to be invested president in 2nd call, but was put in jail inbetween them). Other potential candidates are too in preemptive prison or exile.

Another guess is that this is probably going to be a short mandate, and so they might as well burn this card at this critical times ‚Äîas in, way worse things are to come, so this will be forgotten. The other candidate from their party was Elsa Artadi, which is a hard party person and potential future head of theirs, so they may have wanted to keep her as a future wildcard.

Anyway, I guess they underestimated, yet again, how ruthless can Spain be ‚Äîan irony I can't put enough emphasis on, as while we're accused of expecting the worse from them, they somehow find a way to show up a worse face yet.


On the school thing:

&gt;From what I hear, the problem is the opposite: hardly any classes are taught in Spanish at all and many parents feel their children are being disadvantaged by not learning the national language well enough, which by the way is Spanish, since Catalan is part of the Spanish nation, their own nationhood being understood as an autonomous community within Spain rather than separate from. 

Well, everything of this paragraph is either false or misinformative.

The tale (because it's *a tale*‚Äîand even Spanish leading investigation TV programme, *Salvados*, stated so) goes that the evil Catalan school system, lead by evil Catalan Governments (as usual, we'll ignore that the Socialists governed too in Catalonia and have no problem with this...), has the prevalence of Catalan as a language, not because plenty rational reasons behind it (proportionality, historical repair, inclusion of non-speakers, minoritarian language, etc.), but it was in reality a 40-yo secret plan to indoctrinate children into believing Spain is this evil place, and allegedly the current political situation is partly results of that.

This idea is something that appeared out of chance, that Catalans suddenly upped the ~20% of historical independentist base to the current one, not because of things Spain has done, but because we had that kind of covert conspiracy going on.

It is true, however, that this is a highly misunderstood issue and source of conflict over the last decade or so in Spain. It's also interesting to note how, prior the appearance of Ciudadanos, this was never a problem, and that not even PP pushes against Catalan school system ‚ÄîCiudadanos tries to change it in Madrid, and PP rejects doing so because they know Catalan teachers would go into strike (doing this was the last straw that brought down the PP gov in Balearic Island).

The irony comes in which the push for schooling as much in Catalan as it could be was originally very much of a push from Spanish worker class that immigrated in the 60s, because they wanted their children to have equal opportunities, to be able to learn Catalan. ‚ÄîSomething that wasn't possible for 40 years, during the dictatorship, and as such the first teachers, in the first years, weren't even able to properly teach the language either.

You can read further about how and why Catalan school is how it is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8k1t28/the_spanish_monarchy_is_the_european_monarchy/dz4vc8j/), if you want to, as I was trying to explain it to a fellow Spaniard a few days ago.

Not that one can succeed, for explaining better: These ideas are deeply-rooted in people, and people either understand them straight, or won't ever. Only very hard exposure can make someone change opinions ‚Äîstudents from other places of Spain regularly experience this, and receive a lot of attention in social media after sharing their first hand experience how all the evil things they were taught by the media aren't true; otoh, the opposite happens too, and some people come over here ready to be offended, and those get more coverage from mainstream media ‚Äîas it fits the political agenda‚Äî than the first ones.

It is also worth noting that the level of Spanish of Catalans is above the median in Spain, not because we're better, but because Spanish is a requirement language for everything, and unlike Catalan, you can't really go on with a career without knowing it. Otoh, there're plenty of people all over Spain that push against co-oficiality of any other regional languages, as they have an utilitarian approach at life, saying that those ""village"" languages don't serve anything and would be better off forgotten ‚Äînow, *that's* actually discriminating, and it's hilarious how they don't see the national privilege they're enjoying there, thinking they're not nationalists for pushing for that, but just rational persons.

On the genetics thing:

&gt;What the fuck? Do you seriously believe that? My mind is blown. You know what, I‚Äôm not gonna link you to a source cos I‚Äôve a sneaky suspicion you‚Äôll slag off the source. So just google ‚ÄòJonqueras genetics‚Äô and take your pick. 

Fair enough. I thought you were baiting me, as I'm used to. I wouldn't have dismissed the source, but talked it out, because everyone who actually knows Junqueras knows that he's far from a xenophobe ‚Äîas it happens with Torra.

As [I've found](http://www.eltriangle.eu/cat/notices/2015/07/oriol-junqueras-s-empatolla-amb-la-genetica-41263.php) ‚Äîand this refreshed my memory on this recurrent topic‚Äî this was in 2008, when Junqueras ‚Äîwhom, coincidentally with Torra, isn't a career politician‚Äî was more known for his appearances in radio as a historian entertainer with a pedagogical undertone, where he would take about fun historical facts, history of European football, or any other European history, particularly weird histories on royal families and such. In the article, he mentioned a scientific study of a Rotterdam Universtity which looked at the genetic characteristics of 23 groups of Europeans. He then went to detail what that study said about Catalonia and Spain, pointing out that Catalans (which, until the immigration in the 60s from different parts of Spain, were most of Catalonia) happened to have more in common with French than with Spaniards, and with Italians more than with the Portuguese. The study also stated that Italy, Spain and Germany were the only European countries where it was impossible to group all the citizens into a same kind of genetic group.

This can, of course, framed as him being racist ‚Äîas it was when they dug it up‚Äî, but if we frame it in a historical context, it explains too the history of Catalonia, which is a place that is geographically closer to France and Italy, than to Spain and Portugal. We're historical enemies with Spain, they invaded us and took away our language and laws 3 centuries ago, I don't know what people get so surprised with (?).

Junqueras is also an university professor, and among other classes he gave classes of history of Japan. He's a weird guy, but can't be framed as ill hearted in any way.

On TVs:

&gt;I know loads of people who aren‚Äôt ciudadanos voters and they tell me the Catalan media is a disgrace too, particularly tv3. 
Well it's clear you know lots of people because, as an Englishman, you have a very solid opinion and knowledge on this matter!

Are those people Catalan speakers or Catalans, though? Because if they're not, they wouldn't be able to even watch TV3, as they wouldn't understand it :b  And if they are, you happened to relate to a very specific kind of Catalans, which isn't certainly representative of the complexity of this Country.

Seriously though: TV3 is actually [the most plural](http://preview.ibb.co/kuX0tR/3.jpg) of the biggest Spanish TVs, and while certainly not perfect, only very biased people can make that statement. In fact, El Pa√≠s was sentenced to publish apologies on an slander article on the TV, which was full of falsehoods ‚Äîfalsehoods that perpetuate that myth, but that you can't prosecute of every media outlet out there. It's ironic because while El Pa√≠s is reported as the most reliable and unbiased Spanish source (lol), it's the one that went over the line on that narrative.

People over Spain tend to picture TV3 as biased towards independentism because there's so much of it in it, but they happen to forget that TV3 is Catalonia based, and as such at least half of it's content needs to be about independentists ‚Äîas they make for half of the voters. TV3 isn't a state-wide TV, and it's in fact the National TV of Catalonia ‚Äîwhere RTVE is also present in their other share of public TV.

Otoh, it's RTVE Informatives Comitee that has recently been to the EU about the censure PP imposes them from Madrid, and the EU Comission heard them and is expecting a formal response now from Spain's gov.

In that sense, what wouldn't make sense is that TV3 adjusted their news to political parties, and not in function of what is news. 

It's as it happens in this sub. I've been told to push an agenda, but it's not my fault that some of the most interesting things happening in the EU, other than economy, are happening in Catalan politics. If there're news, there're. It also means you're alive. Ciudadanos &amp; co. wan, however, to be in the news when their parties and people aren't as mobilised as independentists. Their voters tend to make the news for violent episodes that don't get coverage in statewide media, and they don't like that either.

PP, Ciudadanos and PSOE people regularly use expressions like ""disinfection"" to refer to TV3, btw. Talk about harsh wording and racism/xenophobia.

---

Finally, back to the ideas of xenophobia/racism and cultures/nations:

&gt; That may be how you feel but it‚Äôs not clear that was the intention of Torras when he said that. 
&gt;[...]
&gt;I am English and I can tell you there is a lot of prejudice between these nations and all of it is ugly. I certainly don‚Äôt put it down to banter.
&gt;

I don't think we'll agree about this.

I just think that, if in a certain nationality there is a prevalent trait, not as much of genetics but of culture, why wouldn't anyone be able to refer to it?

We do it over here, in this sub, constantly. Even if that trait is good, shouldn't pointing it out be xenophobe too? ‚ÄîAs it would mean that other people are less than that?

Remember the OP source. It's the biggest association against racism in Catalonia, and they state that, while they don't like nor share all that kind of discourse ‚ÄîI don't either, personally‚Äî and they in fact condemn it ‚ÄîI'd do so too, if it was a discourse, which it isn't‚Äî, it doesn't constitute racism, as racism is calling for those things in the context of potiics, something nobody here has done or proposed of doing ‚Äîonly Ciudadanos does that, wanting to destroy everything that is Catalan and doesn't adhere to their idea of State-Nation of Spain, or currently banning the Catalan law that guaranteed medical coverage to all immigrants, documented or not.

The President has actually said plenty of other good things about Spaniards, the good side of Spaniard culture that there is, that is tolerant, that recognises the plurality of it's own country, but that unfortuantely, is minoritarian as of today. Media won't dig that kind of things, of course, because who cares about quality journalism.

So... You say you're English, and that you perceive as ugly the prejudice over there between the different Nations of your State. Now imagine that, among those prejudices, you didn't recognise any of the other Nations in your country (but instead tell them they're lesser nations, nationalities), and among it, that they didn't even have their own National Teams, and were forced to share triumphs with yours ‚Äîwhich afaik, happens over some disciplines.

Things would get uglier then, because insults can happen between equals that things won't escalate, but it's when such insults happen from a position of power that they get ugly. Slovenian philosopher Zizek has some famous quotes on that, on which he shared that being able to insult each other without this prompting actions is a measure of respect. The warning comes when that attitude prompts political actions. 

Moreso, let's take Churchill. Those were, of course, other times, but he did refer to Spaniards as animals too, back in the day. Would you be ok if we were to frame Englishmen as xenophobes because their most prominent person having said such thing? Of course not, because context matters! ‚ÄîExcept when it doesn't suit us, apparently!

It's absurd to think that, in an hypothetical Catalan Republic, hard Catalanists would push for measures to punish non-catalans. Because, even if they wanted, which they don't, that'd make them lose the elections!

Ironically, the push right now in 1st line politics in Spain ‚Äîand the OP statement talks about this‚Äî is a horse race for whoever is harsher against Catalans (or independentists, if you like it better). Some call for an Ulster-like apporach, some say that they'll change the law to adjust what happened to the crime of rebellion, and the government is preventing the new Councillors to be named. They didn't respect the electoral results, but we're the xenophobes.

If you think about EU as a single unit importing strawberries from Spain makes more sense.
If you think about EU as individual countries producing strawberries locally makes more sense.

First of all, Nurnberg only considered the restricted amount of determined facts of crimes by Nazis and some of their collaborators. It didn't consider crimes committed by winners, like Katyn massacre or Bombing of Dresden. WW2 is a huge and bloody part of the history of XX century and you can't reduce it to just Nurnberg.

2853,"&gt;Once you dehumanize your so-called enemy, there's no boundary to cruelty. Men, women, children. It doesn't matter. Once you're down that path, all you see are vermin. Same old song and dance.

This has been done time and time again. Generation after generation and we never learn... And sadly it will be repeated around the world indefinitely. Because one day there will be a generation where World War II means nothing to them. Just as the many atrocities and wars long before World War II have been forgotten or the potency of their horror diminished. 

The Nazis did it 70 years ago. And ISIS have done it today, who will do it tomorrow? The amount of hate it takes to do the evil that these people have done is inconceivable. Yet each and every time it happens there is a traceable lead up to the atrocity.

Hence why it is important for people to study why and how these things happen. Why and how the Nazis did what they did. Why and how ISIS did what it did. So hopefully a genocide can be prevented because people will see the all too familiar pattern before the bad stuff takes place and can hopefully take measures to prevent it.

Hitler's Circle of Evil on Netflix is a good documentary that shows how Hitler and his ilk did what they did. And how they got the Germans on board with it.

My own country has a potential Hitler-wannabe in the form of Julius Malema that is stoking the coals of division and resentment with his EFF much like the Nazi party did with Germany and Malema too could lead my country down a very dark path.

What EU law and how was different than NS? Regardless of this before SS was Nabucco, SS was more an attempt of Russia to sabotage Nabucco.

EU didn't pull its weight in support of Nabucco and Azeris caved under Russia pressure and that project was killed. Russia pushed SS exactly for that and EU kill it too (mostly based on Gazprom special made pretensions if I understand correct) so the NS to go on. Very convenient indeed.

&gt;There is no advantage in doing so. The only advantage in this regard is EE collecting transit fees.

Really, do you think that if NS would have go through Latvia first it will increase that much some transit fees? About the advantages, why Russia cut off Ukraine etc, read again my previous post to not repeat myself. Or you mean advantages exclusively for Russia and Germany?

Noble families themselves owned about 20% of that 85%, a very disproportionate amount, but not all that much compared to the total monopoly. From what I can see most of the nobolity were tories anyway.

Its true, some irish protestants were involved in the rising against british rule, and in the 47 election about 40% of the vote (due to suffrage rules it was mostly protestants who actually had the vote, since you had to own land of a certain value to vote, though there were many catholic MPs), voted for the Irish repeal movement which sought for better suffrage rules and a seperate Kingdom of Ireland that had existed before the union, which was up from 24% from the prior election. That doesnt mean they still didnt own the land monopoly.

This isnt to say its their fault either, since as with all famines, there were many many causes. I would say the bulk of which was the land monopoly, the blight itself, and the very poor reaction by the british government. The land monopoly was mostly in place because of previous laws restricting the rights of catholics, the effects of which persisted for a long time after the laws themselves were repealed (so again, something you can blame the British for).

Bare in mind that even if the irish parliament did still exist, the whigs (the party that refused to implement reforms) still won by popular vote (though lost in total seats) though this probably would have been different had either of our countries actually had proper democratic suffrage laws.",Œ†œÅŒµœÑœÑŒ±ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ!,/r/europe/comments/8kzghx/today_is_the_circassian_day_of_mourning_it/dzcjh7q/,TheSirusKing,1526931300

2993,"Yes, that certainly contributed to the problem. The death rate of POWs was at it's highest during the first months of 1942, when the food problem in Finland was at it's worst. At the time few people cared about prisoners dying, many were very bitter about the Winter War. There was an attitude of ""why should we feed these foreign invaders when we risk famine ourselves?"" 



And during the first years of war the POW camps were ran by the Civil Guards (*suojeluskunnat*). It was a loosely organized volunteer organization which consisted of small municipal groups. It simply wasn't competent enough to handle 80 000 prisoners. In 1942 authorities became worried about the high death rates of POWs and ordered the living conditions in prison camps to be improved, and the Civil Guards were removed from charge.


Interestingly, there weren't many mass executions of POWs in Finland. The goal wasn't to exterminate prisoners.

The EU was arrogant enough to actually think it was some inevitability which no one would ever leave, now it reaps the consequences. 

These paragraphs are quite telling:

&gt;As Dhaval Joshi of BCA Research has pointed out, Italy is in some respects similar to Japan. Both countries faced difficulties because their zombie banks proved incapable of lending to the private sector. Japan solved this problem by getting the public sector to do the lending, even though this meant a big increase in its debt ratio. Italy is in a worse position because the eurozone‚Äôs fiscal rules mean it has not been allowed to run bigger budget deficits.

&gt;Italy has lower total indebtedness ‚Äì private and public combined ‚Äì than Britain, France and Spain, but as far as the EU‚Äôs fiscal rules are concerned only public debt matters. Joshi notes: ‚ÄúHence, the Italian government was prevented from recapitalising its banking system, and the Italian economy stagnated for a decade.‚Äù

The period of 1939 until 1945, and even beyond, in Eastern Europe is not a struggle between ''Good and Evil'', as it might seem like in the West \- a struggle between liberal democracies and a authoritarian, genocidal state. In the East it was a struggle between two genocidal states run by paranoid lunatics. Within this context Latvia experienced three ethnic cleansings \- one in 1940 with the first Soviet occupation, the second being the German occupation period, and the third being the ethnic cleansing committed after the war by the Soviet Union.

And as you can guess \- this muddies the entire situation. You can be called a Nazi for pointing out your grandmother was deported in a freezing cattle car to Siberia.

3147,"Hm...

If you're well payed and have your own place to live, it's pretty great. People with proper income generally enjoy Belgrade, it's vibrant, busy, still cheap on European terms. The city is generally safe considering it's size and the weather is nice, with both hot summers and snowy winters. 

If you're among the majority that's just making ends meet, than it's not so great. You pay the rent, the bills, and not much is left to enjoy all that is out there.

The downsides are plentiful. The Metro was never built, so we rely on buses, trams and trolleys, while many others prefer going to work (alone) by car. This makes for terrible traffic jams and potential for high air pollution was it not for Belgrade's strong wind - the Ko≈°ava - which makes the air clean and fresh. The city politicians are corrupt assholes (either that or morons) who constantly make poor decisions. Some kind of restoration, refurbishing, road mending, pipe fixing, heat-lines expanding is constantly going around everywhere, so one never knows when one's bus will abruptly stop in the middle of it's route and inform the passengers the line temporarily ends there. The area I live in (in the photo) is full of construction sites of residential buildings that are squeezed in the place of demolished family houses of pre-WW1/WW2 Belgrade, which gives way to a lot of noise. The old, narrow streets become canyons of high buildings, constantly jammed with cars that can't find a parking space. The suburban parts lack proper (i.e. frequent enough) transportation to the center, and the still expanding, young communities such as Stepa Stepanovic, Altina, Zemun, Borca.... don't have enough schools, kindergartens, roads and other infrastructure. We have very little migrants (European, MENA, other foreigners, whichever) because we're still among the poorest places in Europe. And being that Serbia has a catastrophically low birth-rate and thousands leave the country, the spread of Belgrade is, I should assume, about to stop any moment now.

Nevertheless, there is still this feeling of a special city. An honest, open, lively, gritty, grumpy place with a gentle smile always on its face.

Serbian writer Momo Kapor (not from Belgrade) said that in his life he only experienced two cities where one could come for the first time, sleep over, and in the morning feel like you've been the resident of the city from the beginning. Those two were, according to him, New York and Belgrade.

3172,"I can give several explanations for that.

Firstly, the nazi crimes were generally exposed after WWII, condemned and the perpetrators punished. However, Stalinist crimes were not allowed to be talked about in this region up until late 1980s, as perestroika and glasnost changed it, but it was never dealth with in a similar way. Furthermore, Russia later took somewhat of a step back towards more apologetic attitude with Putin.

Secondly, Soviet occupation lasted for nearly half a ~~decade~~century, while nazi occupation for some 3 years. People think about the former much more than the latter.

Thirdly, you might indeed be correct that as Jews were the main targets, there might be less of a kinship feeling, even though I would personally think of it as discriminative considering Jews were mostly local citizens as well.

All in all, I would say it's somewhat of a problem here. People know about nazi crimes and condemn them, but they often don't want to see the local collaboration part. Not only would it show that there weren't just those evil foreigners doing all the bad things, but it would also teach people that apparently, even your own countrymen can easily do such horrible stuff under certain conditions.

3433,"&gt;The issue I have is that the King has the privilege of serving you merely by birth.

Exactly, serving you, not ruling you. It's not the age of absolutism anymore, the King is an unelected individual who's primary role is to serve and represent your country.

&gt; Not sure about Norway but we by definition are subjects of the Queen.

Our monarchy is much more recent than the British one, and our constitution is based primarily on enlightenement ideas. As such the King is the symbol of the nation who works on behalf of the people, we're not his subjects.

Now while the British system does state by law that the British people are the subjects of the Queen, that's not how it works de facto and if it did turn de facto there would be revolution over night.

&gt;The ‚Äúliving symbol‚Äù of the nation is based on a family who were (historically) anointed by god, I find that concept simply weird

That's completely subjective on your part. To give my perspective, I find the monarchy is as much of a historic institution as the Tower of London is a historic building. It's a direct, living connection to the past and to British tradition/culture. To remove the monarchy would be to sever British ties with the past and to remove part of it's history to some extent.

China for example lost so much of it's heritage when the last Emperor was overthrown. Japan could have lost so much had the Americans forced the Emperorship to be disbanded. I don't appreciate such cultural iconoclasm personally. 

&gt;Is it right that we put people in that position?

That's not for me to decide. However like you said, there are procedures to abdicate or even to reject the crown while you're still the heir presumptive. If someone truly doesn't want to become the head of state, there are procedures to avoid that.

&gt;I agree the monarchy is popular. But I think it‚Äôs a case some people being really vocal, and the vast majority just not caring enough to debate it.

3446,"&gt; If the whole point of your company is to rent out houses in residential zones for cheaper prices, then I don't see how it wouldn't be beneficial to ban Airbnb.

Banning airbnb won't stop people from renting houses to tourists. Airbnb is just a tool. Banning a tool when people misuse it makes no sense because they will find other tools.

It will also hurt those that use airbnb legitimately.

&gt; What Knee-jerk reactions?

Airbnb is not the source of the problem. Banning airbnb will not stop home owners from renting to tourists. To stop this you need local administrations to uphold proper residential zoning areas and fine the home owners that disobey them. Airbnb is just a tool that is easily replaceable. Banning it is a political move that doesn't solve the problem.

&gt; I don't hate tourists, I am trying to address this issue objectively.

Banning airbnb is the exact opposite of ""addressing this issue objectively"".

3466,"&gt;Equality of opportunity and equality of outcome are different things though.

And you can have neither with capitalism.

&gt;Economics include quality of life. We are economical animals one way or another.

But it isnt the only factor and not even the most important one. I, and the overwhelming majority of people, would prefer to have less mindless consumption if it meant we could have good decent and humble lives, like our parents had. So why cant we have that if we live in a democracy?

&gt;You pointed me to a specific school and a very specific case. Not talking generaly.

This is pretty much true for all the grande √©coles. Anyway, the gap in educational achievement between rich and poor in France is absolutely undeniable. The fact that the school system is failing due to lack of fund is absolutely undeniable. Why is it the case if the GDP keeps increasing? Where is all the money going?

&gt;People are having less kids because when a society is getting richer people tend to want to spend more time with themselves and for themselves. You are free to go back to tribalism if you want to. No one stops you from gathering a bunch of like minded people and living of a simple life in some rural area.

I am not talking about the number of kids but about the amount of time parents spend with their children. Nowadays both mothers and fathers have to work in order to feed their children so they dont have the time to actually educate them. Only the rich have the opportunity to have only one parent working leaving the other the time to educate their children, which give them an undeniable advantage in term of education. Also rurals areas have been destroyed in France due to foreign competition putting our farmers out of business so I cant even retire to the countryside!

&gt;Businesses are being shipped towards more free economies. If you try to strangle them with regulations and protectionism they flee.

Or you could stop them from fleeing? Like we did in the 60s? What a grand and novel idea.

&gt; You don't care about the global poor?

Of course I do. But when we are talking about how we should organise french or european society it has very little relevance. French welfare is for french people after all, not for chinese people.

&gt; You dream of society as it was before the World Wars?

State capitalism under de Gaulle and Pompidou is not before the world wars.

&gt; Nope. Your countries consists of people with different worldview than your own too.

I've even given you ""The Theory of Justice"" on this. 

&gt;the overwhelming majority of people, would prefer to have less mindless consumption if it meant we could have good decent and humble lives

How mindlessly you consume depends on your choices. The system gives you options and you choose.

&gt;The fact that the school system is failing due to lack of fund is absolutely undeniable. Why is it the case if the GDP keeps increasing? Where is all the money going?

Funding education is a domestic choice. Nothing to do with globalism. 

&gt;Nowadays both mothers and fathers have to work in order to feed their children so they dont have the time to actually educate them.

Not having 5 children if you couldn't support them is a good idea too you know.

How do you stop them from fleeing?

3488,"&gt;Banning airbnb won't stop people from renting houses to tourists. Airbnb is just a tool. Banning a tool when people misuse it makes no sense because they will find other tools.

It depends, of course. Sometimes banning the most used tool and other tools does indeed work, and this would be in addition to giving massive fines to organizations and people who rent out in residential zones.

&gt;Airbnb is not the source of the problem. Banning airbnb will not stop home owners from renting to tourists. To properly stop this, you need local administrations to uphold proper residential zoning areas and fine the home owners that disobey them. Airbnb is just a tool that is easily replaceable. Banning it is a political move.

Again, I am in favor of fines and banning it because short term, it will be effective and people need solutions now in addition to long term plans.

Well, like with most things in life, banning things is usually indeed a political move. So what?

&gt;Banning airbnb is the exact opposite of ""addressing this issue objectively"".

In your perspective, not mine.
Banning the most used service to rent out houses illegally will work in at least the short term.

&gt;Again, airbnb was not designed for people who want to illegally rent their houses to tourists. There are a lot of people who use it legitimately.

&gt; You have to read the history in the broader sense. The social democratic hiccup didn't even last a century. It was the exception not the rule. The left went from liberal to (slightly) the left of liberal and after the 90s we see a return to liberal.

I really don't. I don't think that the old-school imperialists are analogous to the fascists or modern day conservatives either. Liberalism too has keeled over and has been revived in various forms. Marxism lasted what, 150 years or so?

The line you're trying to draw does not connect properly for political movements. There is a philosophical or at least greater ideology connection for sure but our definitions of right and left are too restricted for that. When using the right-left spectrum as shorthand, we aren't trying to put George Washington on it. We're trying to put today (or in this case just 20 years ago) on it.

&gt; That's because everyone saw the obvious. Global trade brings forth many pros that outweight the cons.

Great, that story is still tied to the freeing of capital from its national confines and we can freely discuss the downsides or the sustainability from the perspective of various countries or peoples. Even if you _had_ to privatize everything to trade with the world (you don't, but I'm skipping it) that still means that Blair represents a move to the right.

&gt; I used Hayek as an example of to showcase the fact that state involvement doesn't mean socialist. It is something that will exist even under left or right governments. At least for the foreseeable future. The NHS doesn't make one socialist.

Yes, that's my point. We aren't arguing about socialism. We started at where Blair stood economically.

&gt; Same answer though. The state of socialism doesn't even exist. Egalitarian and welfare societies (like countries of the Nordic model) are not socialist. They are free economies with private enterprise and engaged in global trade.

You're literally arguing my position. We aren't arguing about socialism. There's plenty of capitalism to the left of Blair.

&gt; Or cut welfare spending and invest that money into things that will generate leverage on the part of Europe. ""Buying"" Africa, funding a start-up culture or establishing European military presence outside of Europe.

Laurier to the left of McDonald. Wilfrid Laurier to the left of John Macdonald. FDR to the left of Alf Landon. Kim Dae-jung to the left of Park Geun-hye. Trudeau to the left of Diefenbaker.

That's an awfully anachronistic definition of liberal you got there, considering some of the people they're up against include anything from (old-school) imperialist to other liberals and you even cite people who worked against the liberal outline in terms of economic policy.

&gt; This ignores two very important figures in Eastern history and politcs. Lee Kuan Yew and Deng Xiaoping. In the case of LKY we can't really compare with something older since he is the founder but with Deng we can make important comparision before and after his ascendance.

It doesn't ignore it, it compliments it. The fact that Xiaoping found a market hungry for cheap labor and capital to put that labor to productive use is entirely relevant. The other case here is India, which hasn't grown so rapidly despite historically being more democratic and in general free trade than China. A comparison that has profound implications.

&gt; Asian countries like Singapore or South Korea or Japan (especially Singapore though) has exceptional and top notch welfare states. Including healthcare, pensions etc. Europe doesn't hold a monopoly over these things.

They also have a very different social order. In fact the protection of their industrial bases and welfare states while difficult to compare, elevate the old-school social democrat's case as these systems require legal and social effort to protect them, beyond simple market dynamics. Being an exporter does come with its perks too, although a few of these states can't really be compared to your generic economy. Notably: Japan is in a hole that effects every discussion and Singapore is too specialized/small, extracting value from its size and location. We would indeed expect Singapore to benefit from a world where capital is freer.

&gt; You can't avoid this global competition. We all live on the same planet and markets that include as all are going to interconnect us as long as we trade and cooperate for resources. Friedman's pencil analogy comes to mind when thinking of how fundamental our global trade is.

China can and does. Their story of development directly contradicts the liberal free-enterprise model or Ricardian model for trade. They say so openly themselves (incl. their economists). Remember, we're not arguing communism v capitalism. We're arguing the supremacy of the market which is what Blair and the like accepted, bringing their parties to the right.

&gt; Sure. And they won't. Diversification comes inevitably. But China had to rise fast via that sweatshop model. And it's paying off. As societies get richer and more advanced the market can be utilized in different ways.

The point being? They are still liberals and on the left. And I've given you their right-wing counterparts just to make the comparison. 

&gt; The fact that Xiaoping found a market hungry for cheap labor and capital to put that labor to productive use is entirely relevant.

Had it continued Mao's way there would have been no capital flows coming from the West. Sure Nixon too played an important role in this but in the end it was China that made the necessary reforms and got engaged. 

&gt;The other case here is India, which hasn't grown so rapidly despite historically being more democratic and in general free trade than China.

India has only been lately involved with neoliberal reforms, if I could call them that. Singh and Modi and not enough history yet. But they've put India on the globalist path. Projections are phenomenal btw. 

&gt;They also have a very different social order.

That is true. But we can also see left wing welfare under the Anglosaxon model which a) is not European and b) is not happening under an Asian social order. William Mackenzie King for example. 

&gt;China can and does. 

It doesn't avoid competition. It just ""cheats"". It plays differently. But it pretty much engaged in global trade. It still is capitalism. To paraphrase their saying, it is ""~~socialism~~ capitalism with Chinese characteristics"". 

&gt;Your argument that Europe has to compete with them by lowering wages isn't sustainable if they """"""diversify"""""" into the high-value products which Europe decided to specialize in.

We're not arguing about communism. The freeing of capital to go global in the 80s is a fairly well understood process. Financialization, easy international capital flows, the lowering of protective barriers so the freed capital could sell its products back home. Basically Thatcher.

&gt; India has only been lately involved with neoliberal reforms, if I could call them that. Singh and Modi and not enough history yet. But they've put India on the globalist path. Projections are phenomenal btw.

China never implemented the neoliberal reforms as they're called in the west. They're still a very state-influenced and supported economy with plenty of protective barriers that would be unthinkable around here. The comparison with India was not about neoliberalism (as it is described in the west) itself since that's too new for that part of the world but the difference that a well-organized state which interferes heavily in the market and has the capacity to do so makes.

&gt; It doesn't avoid competition. It just ""cheats"". It plays differently. But it pretty much engaged in global trade. It still is capitalism. To paraphrase their saying, it is ""socialism capitalism with Chinese characteristics"".

This is not a card game with rules. There is no cheating, only what works in what prevailing global order. And we're not arguing about communism v capitalism. We started at Blair. There's a lot of room on the left of Blair for capitalism before you get to communism.

&gt; I am not sure what percentage of their labor force can diversify. Population differences are dramatic.

I'm both a capitalist and a supporter of egalitarianism, namely equality of opportunity. I think virtually all liberal capitalist countries have values 'rooted in egalitarian ideas'. 

&gt; Defined as a 21st century socialism,[14]

By a single article from an Argentinian newspaper. In fact if you go to the wikipedia page on **21st Century Socialism** you don't find the word Norway listed at all https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_of_the_21st_century.

&gt; You mention yourself that a primary reason Norway is doing extremely well is having state-owned companies exploit their natural resources.

Yes, but nationalising a national resource and trading that resource with other wealthy capitalist countries is not an indicator in any way of successful socialist economic policy, in fact it suggests perhaps that the current welfare model would largely be untenable were it not for the luck of holding so much oil in their reserves.

3628,"It is really common that an invading force conquers a country and rules it, in many cases for centuries, often transplanting religion, language, legal and political structures, but does not radically change that underlying genetic makeup of the local population.

It's the same for for example Britain- British people are also, primarily, genetically, descended from the original Celtic (or possibly even pre-Celtic) inhabitants, they were invaded and conquered repeatedly by the Romans, the Vikings and then finally the Normans, who ruled the country from that point onwards, but the British people themselves are not Norman or Roman, genetically. The Anglo-Saxons had the most impact, particularly in England (they had minimal impact in Wales or Scotland) but genetically, even English people *mostly* pre-date the Anglo-Saxons.

&gt;The only invaders that left a lasting legacy are the Anglo-Saxons. As well as giving us the English language, the Anglo-Saxons, whose influx began around AD 450, account for 10 to 40 per cent of the DNA in half of modern-day Britons. ...

&gt;The largest cluster accounted for half the participants and occupies almost the whole of eastern and southern England and most of the Midlands. This turned out to be the genetic legacy of the Anglo-Saxon invasions. Even so, at least 60 per cent of the DNA in the cluster had survived from earlier migrants ...

&gt;Given the cultural significance of the Roman, Viking and Norman invasions, it‚Äôs surprising they didn‚Äôt leave greater genetic legacy. For the Romans and Normans, that may be because they were ruling elites who didn‚Äôt intermarry with the natives.

That ""price"" was completely avoidable. China emerged from Maoism, arguably a far more retarded economic system than anything in Eastern Europe and they managed to keep unemployment much lower than 15-20% that you guys had for 20 years. 

People just don't want to admit out of ideological commitment to neoliberalism that some of these ""reforms"" were in fact bad and should have avoided. The choice was not a simple ""neoliberalism or communism"". A more gradual, state capitalist model √° la East Asia could have been adopted but that did not happen due to the ideological framework that was so popular at the time.

Today, there is more openness in economic circles about the so-called 'shock doctrine' and its downsides. The IMF has openly attacked austerity policies after being behind the curve for years. But the point is that a lot of that ""price"" was not necessary to pay and it was a failure of the policies that they didn't produce smoother transition for people. Anyone claiming that double-digit unemploment was ""necessary"" for 20 years straight is either an idiot, or, more likely, an ideological charlatan.

3800,"Spain is a great example of how the definition of ""federation"" and ""unitary state"" is kind of meaningless like all the other definitions in politics and that you are what you call yourself.

In any case as far as the Spanish constitution goes the central government does not have unlimited authority over the devolved local governments; they cannot _just_ dissolve them but only when they first break the agreements themselves which is what Catalonia supposedly did here.

In the case of the UK the central government can dissolve devolved governments at its own pleasure without needing to as much as give a reason at least that's the idea; it's further made more complicated by that the UK lacks a formal written constitution and what the central government can and cannot do is not really written down anywhere but defined by tradition and not by legal texts. The central government can devolve and evolve local governments purely because they have done so in the past and it set a precedent which makes it unlikely that anyone would try to stop them if they did.

The Dutch constitution for instance is very clear on the fact that the provinces can be destroyed, merged, new ones can be created and what-not by the central government's pleasure however the constitution _does_ mandate that there must be provinces which also elect the upper house in a tiered system so in that sense the upper house has elements of federalism.

In some cases it's even stranger because some countries do not require a supermajority to change the constitution.

But really almost all states have some elements of federalism and some limits to what the central government can and cannot do with local governments; it's not a clear-cut difference.",,/r/europe/comments/8krx95/the_spanish_government_wont_lift_article_155_in/dzb6we1/,geile_zwarte_kousen,1526865623

What we're discussing though is how to get there, not after you graduate. Secondly, just because you're in the upper half, that doesn't mean that you're privileged. Mean, mode, median, not all averages are the same.

&gt; Remember, half of the population in most developed countries does not attend university at all but a good deal of them pay taxes. I don't think it's fair that they pay for the tuition of students who then go on to earn high incomes.

Uhh, because that's how taxes work. Just because your taxes are used for something that you don't use directly, it doesn't mean they're not worth it. That's like a rich person saying they shouldn't pay taxes because they don't use public healthcare, nor pay for roads because they fly by helicopter, etc. Those who eventually earn high incomes will not only also pay higher taxes, eventually paying back their education, but also contribute towards improving the country in a manner they couldn't do if they hadn't gone to higher education, which in turn will also benefit those that didn't.

&gt;  Why should people who are professionals not pay for their own education? They have the means!

Because they are **not yet** professionals. Because going to university in a unsubsidised system very highly depends on your parents' wealth and will. Because they might not have the means to move to expensive places where Universities are often located.

3894,"What we do for fun? I would say it's simmilar to everyone else. But I don't really have any comparison to ""mainland folk"", so it's a bit harder to tell what's different. 

There are some pubs/bars here, cinema, the ""Tourada √° corda"", Festivities are also frequent, some small local ones and bigger ones (relatively speaking for the Island). Each island pretty much has 1 or 2 bigger festivities in the summer, those who enjoy that and are able to have the option to travel between Island for almost continuous festivities. At those, concerts are frequent, mostly famous and semi-famous DJ's.

I myself am not that much of a partygoer, and spend most of my free time either at home on the computer (gaming/reddit), riding a bike to where I feel like going. I also occasionaly go to the Cinema with my SO or just go spend an afteroon at the city center with her . There are plenty of options to pick from if you want to go out to eat, a well maintained garden with a great view and quite a few  shops (relatively speaking) to wander around in. 
EDIT: We have water around us everywhere, ofc swimming is an almost daily occurence at times

What is lacking the most around here are things that need a bigger population to thrive, like shopping centers, amusement parks, public pools and simmilar. 

&gt;they've probably done/seen almost everything there is to do by the time they're in their late 20s/30s, at least on the islands closest to them

That is true, specially regarding what one is able to do and see regarding city and activities. However, one could be surprised how many islanders don't know what they are missing out regarding nature on the same island they live in. Really nice trails and parks not even 20km away. I myself have seen quite a few of what the nature has to offer,trough picnick parks, trails and by wandering trough the island on my bikem, but it didn't get stale yet (am 20yo). However I would much like to experience other views the world has to offer. 

The biggest ""obstacle"" is, not surpsisingly, being stuck. I can't just drive a few hours into a direction and be somewhere completely else, I would probably be on the same spot because I just drove a 100km circle. Visiting another island can be cheap, but doesn't have much to offer, specially when you're living on one of the bigger islands already (Terceira/Sao Miguel). However, there are low cost flights wich enable you a flight to Lisbon and back for under 50eu for a few hours/days, but you'd still be lacking a place to stay. And you need to be on the right island for that.

&gt;Also does the internet make you feel more isolated or more connected with the rest of Portugal/Europe/the world?

I would say it makes me feel much more connected in the overall. True, I sometimes read about what I'm ""missing out"", what's happening out there while there's nothing going on here in the meantime, but on the other hand the Internet enables me to know what's going on in the world in the first place. I can read about discoveries, be up to par with new techonogies, talk to random people from the other side of the world, play games with strangers, get to know what's going on, find all the interesting stuff the Internet has to offer...

**In short** : The internet gives me awareness of what I don't have here. But it also puts me on equal level with anyone else despite being on an isolated island. I can be on reddit, play games, inform myself just like anyone living in a big city can.

And we could talk about civil wars in European history that have not involved a single Muslim. The fact remains that there are Muslim majority countries that have extremely low rate of terrorism. Your hypothesis that ""More Muslims = more terror attacks"" does not hold true. In fact, there is a [negative correlation between terror attack victims in Europe and increased Muslim immigration](https://www.statista.com/chart/4093/people-killed-by-terrorist-attacks-in-western-europe-since-1970/). The standard example that is brought with Korea and Poland to prove that those countries have no terrorism because they don't have Muslims is extremely simplistic, terrorists deliberately target NATO allied states for maximum impact, like France and U.K. 50 million Muslims are EU citizens and can go to Poland any day without a visa, many of these terrorists are EU citizens too, why do they not go to Poland to blow people up? It's simple, because Poland and Czech republic are absolutely irrelevant on the world stage.

&gt;just the disparity in education alone is enough of a motivating factor for a highly selective migration policy

I don't disagree with your immigration policy. Although I think any European nation should be open to any immigrant from any where in the world who aquires legal residence and work. But primarily, my issue is what exactly do we do with the Muslims that are already here, many of whom are European citizens?

 The house is expensive AF, yes. Its up for the party to decide if he keeps representing them, and if they decide so, the voters will have a word too in the elections.

When I get to your house, I don't respect your rules, steal from you, damage your property etc. Are you going to sit there and feel bad for me and make excuses for me? Say that poor little me has nowhere to go? No you wont. You'll probably tell me if I don't get my act together and start respecting your house, you'll kick me out right?

Same thing applies here. Except that alot of these refugees were smart and destroyed any documents that could prove where they are actually from, so you can't kick them out. So they essentially get to commit a crime, even murder or rape, and you guys will just let them stay and you'll be nice because you're ""civilized"" right?

I don't think it's correct to say that Labour's swing to the left is a sign of 'trying really hard to scare away voters' since they seem to be doing better in a long time.

EDIT: In fact, I think it's pretty important for politics in general. We need to go back to the time when right wing governments had left wing oppositions and left wing government had right wing oppositions. Both right wing and left wing moving to the centre and even cooperating to create very centrist policies has kind of silenced a lot debate, which populism is now picking up.

There's an argument to be made for example, that if the SPD hadn't gone into a coalition with the CDU previous government, the AfD wouldn't have made it into the German parliament. And that the SPD's participation in the current coalition with the CDU means the SPD and CDU are going to keep shedding voters to the AfD, so that SPD and CDU might lose their majority next election.

This is not just about gas, you also for example don't have many companies building nuclear plants or commercial airplanes and so on. Should Germany have a distribution monopol (which is currently not the case and hopefully won't be the case even with NS2), there would a risk of a lack of competition.

&gt; That Germany, or the West are conspiring to throw Eastern Europe to the wolves in a deal with Russia if necessary.

I didn't say that this is what is happening at the moment.

&gt; Then why do you expect your complaint to be met with anything more with a shrug?

We're discussing on an internet platform. I do not expect that this will lead to any changes in the real-life, neither of us has any influence over it anyway.

&gt; EE would still not have control of the pipelines anyway. Making the whole fuzz about it pointless.

Well at that point it would not be about any damn pipelines for us, it would be about us being occupied or under indirect control fo Russia.

&gt; But the thing you have a problem with is that you would hypothetically be victimized!

Yep, I do not like that this puts some countries in a more vulnerable position.

&gt; You're being hypocritical because you want to deny others something that you nevertheless claim for yourself.

I want CEE countries to not be more vulnerable under a hyphothetical crisis scenario with Russia.

&gt; The entire EU's interests are served by additional pipelines. It makes Russia more dependent on the EU as customer, and less likely to stir up trouble.

No, it's not in the entire's EU interests and no, it doesn't make Russia less likely to stir a trouble in the CEE region.

&gt; Then stop buying gas and close your pipeline with Russia if you don't like being dependent on them? Jeez. If you don't want Russian gas, then what's the problem if Germany does?

We can't do that at the moment, plus this isn't really about my country that much in the first place. It's more so about Poland or Baltics who as far as I know do work on getting rid of their dependency on Russian gas.

&gt; And IS would like to establish the Caliphate, so what? What does that have to do with a gas pipeline?

You think Russian political objectives are not important for their actual behaviour? Of course they are. Russia is doing what they are doing to achieve their objectives. NS2 is something that can potentionally help them with that.

&gt; It takes more than once clown president to take down that alliance. The USA is not an elected dictatorship.

I hope so too.

&gt; Or perhaps you're just very paranoid? Really, I don't see why you need to trust each other ""100%"" in order to not start complaining when your neighbor is getting the exact same pipeline connection you have.

So when my neighbour is doing something that goes against the interests of countries in my region, I cannot complain about that or what?",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/8kbh6i/if_its_america_first_then_europe_will_respond_in/dzah56r/,kristynaZ,1526836853

&gt; Probably through the **exodus of Muslims** following the **liberation** of Balkans from the Ottoman Empire.

The problem is clearly the juxtaposition of ""hey the greatest mass ethnic cleansing/genocide before the first war is called a liberation""

Imagine if I called the Serbian genocide by the Ustashe the Croatian war of liberation. You would probably take issue with that, would you not? 

Then to get back to this point

&gt; As for Alsace Lorraine, honestly, looking at some of its history, despite France being our ally in WWI and Germany the enemy, I feel like the Germans had a stronger claim to it. As for attacking now. Well, if Germany wants to, they do have a claim.

Right, but my point is imagine the French perspective. You can at least sympathize with that right? Also, consequently doesnt Turkey have claims to the whole of the Balkans now? The whole arguement just gets silly after a while. Ultimately, I totally understand why Kosovo and those areas are important for Serbia, but it is also important for you to understand the opposite perspective and see why people might take issue with that. 

&gt; Ultimately, I do feel for those who get expelled, but in a way, they were on the Ottoman side. They, as people here like to say, sold their faith for dinner. They probably also abused the privileges they got with Islam too. And this was most probably how our people saw it back then, probably even more so.

Right, but to bring in an American analogy, who cares if some kid just stole some sweets from the grocery store, doesnt mean he deserves to get shot in the back for it. Even if we assume that there is a sort of collective guilt of all the muslim peasants (when the vast majority were farmers that probably didnt even interact with Christians let alone have the chance to abuse them), the idea that a few of them occasionally spitting on a few Serbian Christians doesnt mean you get to murder them. This doesnt even meet and eye for an eye standard. 

Also, let it be noted that this literally became the justification for the Armenian genocide. The Turks felt scared that they were again going to be mass ethnically cleansed/victims of genocide in Anatolia as well so they decided to preempt that. The Balkan Wars basically directly lead to the Armenian Genocide. This sort of collective guilt is one of the first steps on the road to genocide.

Even if we assume that there is a sort of collective guilt of all the muslim peasants (when the vast majority were farmers that probably didnt even interact with Christians let alone have the chance to abuse them), the idea that a few of them occasionally spitting on a few Serbian Christians doesnt mean you get to murder them. This doesnt even meet and eye for an eye standard. 

Of course not. I'm just saying why, especially from the eyes of a 19th Balkan Christians the Muslim converts would be deemed collaborators and why he wouldn't want to have them in the Balkans. Even nowadays most Muslims are just deemed Ottoman leftovers. Add in of course that they lived in the time of the empire and saw its horrors first hand. 

&gt;Also, let it be noted that this literally became the justification for the Armenian genocide. The Turks felt scared that they were again going to be mass ethnically cleansed/victims of genocide in Anatolia as well so they decided to preempt that. The Balkan Wars basically directly lead to the Armenian Genocide. This sort of collective guilt is one of the first steps on the road to genocide. 

Well, shit. Still, what's the point? That I should feel guilty for the Armenian genocide? Blame ourselves? 

I agree of course that collective guilt is bad, but again, should we be blamed, even partially, for the Armenian genocide?",Rep. Srpska,/r/europe/comments/8kmgwh/bosnian_croatian_and_serbian_spoken_as/dzahtcm/,A3xMlp,1526837599

You vote for the legislative and each party gets n seats based thereupon and the amount of seats dictates the control the legislative has when they appoint the executive.

After that point you can argue that the people in the executive typically being high profile party members who control the party control the legislative but only because the legislative originally put them there and this isn't always the case that the party leaders ascend to the executive; sometimes they elect to stay in the legislative and exert their control from there.

Like say Mark Rutte; he's prime minister of the Netherlands but that's not the place whence his real power derives; it derives from being the party leader of the largest party which is a distinct position and through that he can influence the party greatly.

4343,"Its not as simple as that. The zeppelin has still have to be aerodynamic and the skeleton must be rigid and strong enough for side winds and its own weight or it would bend. The construction time for a single zeppelin would greatly surpass than a smaller helicopter. The skeleton itself must be complex. Usually the costs are exponential especially when it was over 230m in length. Its why there were so few made for travel. The wooden frame planes at those times were many times cheaper.

&gt;Well, just like helicopters, they can land relatively vertically, meaning you only need a stretch of relatively flat area, even grass, and you are set.

Wrong. Most zeppelins were hard to land due to strong side winds and requiring a large footbal field sized landing area. They also required a mooring tower to be tied to....The zeppelin was  236.6 m long. I don't think it can land anywhere whereas a helicopter is smth like 30m. You would also need a platform to unload the passengers.

Most spanish people want them to vote, it's just that the consitution says that they can't. So the constitution needs to get changed before they can. But is the Catalan government trying to change that with the cooperation of the rest of the communities \(who are also kind of anti madrid, like it's not just a Barcelona thing\)? No, they just want out. Spain is just saying no to independentism, it's really unfair that people here think the government is unwilling to communicate, the reality is they can't talk to someone who isn't willing to compromise, and independence is important for independists and the constitution is important to everyone else. How do you propose they talk about it?

In my mind, it's no coincidence that the leader of the modern Catalan independence movement \- Jordi Pujol \- was found to have millions in a bank account in Switzerland and got swiftly thrown down the memory hole.
2. They really are buying into their own propaganda and think that they are truly righteous in this.

4417,"&gt; However what is clear is that they are two sides of the same coin - opposites.

Can you define what you exactly mean here? Are you saying that the loss of minority languages in France constitutes genocide.

&gt; Depends on the person you ask. Wars have been fought, heroes made, legends written for both cases. People have preferred death in the face of their identity being forcefully changed. This is human nature. We are hardwired to belong and protect our group. Here is a question for you: Which of those two do you consider that Ataturk has done?

Once again you drift from the subject at hand. I don't know what dichotomy you've set up, so I'm going with: neither.

&gt; Religion is the old world (and no it never was a cover for ethnicity)

A state in existence today you dolt.

&gt; modern day Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan....

None of these are solely based on religion. Iran tries real hard to establish a workable national identity fit for both sects. The fact that it transcends what we think of ethnicity doesn't mean it's just built on religion.

Pakistan isn't a nation but to the extent that it is, the state is a nation state. The religious crazies are but one faction of the political arena, they don't form the backbone. You could even argue that Pakistan is a society teetering on the brink of failure due to its tensions.

Saudi Arabia is indeed built on the supremacy of a single religion but it is also one of the weakest in terms of a unifying identity. Without their oil money their peace is not sustainable.

&gt; Racial is more limited in our history, however tribal (which is a form of racial groups, beyond ethnicity) is well alive and kicking in many parts of the world, some small Arab states are like that, Saudi Arabia maybe

What the fuck. None of the Arab states are like that. Saudi Arabia is not built _on_ race, it's built _despite_ the tribal separations.

&gt; Rulers don't count though - they were not the majority. The vast majority of the people is what counts and the glue used for the most part was religious - and it wasn't a cover. This goes even beyond the three abrahamic religions, but even in the classic era it was the different pantheons which counted as religious unity.

I didn't say rulers. Why are you saying rulers?

I told you that ethnicity is what is privileged by the states of today. You disagreed and said that they weren't because in the past it was something else. I told you that yes it was something else in the past and that's proof that a specific sort of identity can be extremely privileged. I'm telling you again now that generally ethnicity is the privileged identity and the states which don't conform to this have usually had major issues with stability. Why do you insist on misinterpreting what's been said rather than just asking for clarification?

Not really, during ""Ancien R√©gime"", the Kingdom of France was heavily decentralized: different currencies, management of most taxes locally, parliaments for each duchies and constituency, etc, etc.
I'm not a nostalgic of Ancien R√©gime though, I just believe we could do better in terms of decentralization, at least like what Germany or Spain achieved. 
What is surrounding Paris currently (not mentioning the Parisian suburb in Ile-de-France, but Picardie, R√©gion Centre, parts of Normandy and Burgundy/Champagne) is a wasteland, because of lacks of public investment and interest. 
The regions I cited were sadly quite dynamic in their times (middle age to pre-indulstrial age), and I'm not even mentioning other areas of France such as ""le Nord"", their collapse is due to centralism. Would you keep saying ""this is just wrong"" or ""speculative""? Prove me I'm wrong them.

&gt;This is just wrong. A lot of people lives there - would you prefer if we ignored the facts and didn't use money for where the people live? You don't seem to understand the situation of the area at all. Parisians don't all live in golden palaces, you know. And decentralized countries also have those ""megalomaniac projects"". This has nothing to do with centralization.

I never said there weren't investments in ""provinces"", just that it's disproportionate, and that we could do better in decentralization, if you compare with examples existing elsewhere in Europe. 

Also did I say all Parisians were wealthy? Don't put words in my mouth I never stated at all. That's a strawman. 
I'm myself certainly gonna have to move to Paris (and I'm not rich), because I can't do the work where I live currently. And I know that elsewhere this could have been different, if I compare how things are done in Spain. 

I know some people support centralism, but the positive effect in the French economy is highly debatable.

News of the week: Electoral fever is affecting the government again. Mostly [N-VA] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Flemish_Alliance) is being a pain in the ass for their coalition partners.

* N-VA chairman [Bart De Wever] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_De_Wever) went to London to receive the Edmund Burke Award from [Michael Gove] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gove), an initiative from the [Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_of_Conservatives_and_Reformists_in_Europe). A day later De Wever wrote an opinion piece about the relevance of Burke in the newspaper [De Tijd] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Tijd), where he said that even though he was against the Brexit, he understands why the UK did it. He also mourned the loss of the UK as a force against what he called ""Jacobin Eurofederalism"". De Wever sweared that N-VA will try to take over ""the conservative torch"" and continue to protest an EU ""where an unelected bureaucrat uses your tax money to pay Southern European debts"". According to De Wever there will never be a European identity and is the EU nothing more than a treaty.
* The growing Euroscepticism of the N-VA clashes with the pro-EU stance of their coalition partners. Especially Prime Minister [Charles Michel] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Michel) (MR), who wants to take a leading position next to Macron and Merkel to further integrate the EU, wasn't happy with the opinion piece. Michel didn't like that he got the award from a Brexiteer, right at the moment when Michel was at the EU summit in Sofia. He feels like N-VA is hurting his European ambitions.
* Little later De Wever also heavily criticised the energy agreement the various governments of Belgium made. According to him to him the targets of the agreement are not realistic, especially the nuclear exit by 2025 is problematic to him (he has a point there though imo). He called the agreement a symbolic act between ministers.
* And to the surprise of their coalition partners, Federal Secretary of State for Asylum and Migration [Theo Francken] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theo_Francken) (N-VA) and Federal Minister of Finances [Johan Van Overtveldt] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Van_Overtveldt) (N-VA) want the National Bank to calculate the cost of migration in Belgium. While there already was a study on the costs of the asylum crisis in 2016, now the study has to look at the total picture of the costs and benefits of (all kinds of) migration from outside the EU. Opponants call it an election stunt, which is implied by N-VA itself. Francken admitted that the study must be finished before [May 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Belgian_federal_election) and that the results of the study will be used in the campaign. When the NBB stated the study will most likely not be ready before the elections, Van Overtveldt said that he will release the parts of the study that are finished by then.

In other news:

* [Club Brugge] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Brugge_KV) became national football champions.
* A very weird family drama happened in [Oudenburg] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oudenburg). A man broke into a home to kill his ex wife and forced her three teens (his stepchildren) to watch as he stabbed her. The weird part, which caused the case to get a lot of media attention, is that the man worked as a [clown] (https://beneluxtheater.be/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Foto-clown-Tobi.jpg) and that he was assisted by a friend of him who is a [yodeller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57IGSZ6o7Dw). After the deed, the clown fled to the top of an appartement building in [Bredene] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bredene), where he'd shoot at people who came too close to building (luckily no one got injured), before finally surrendering to the police.
* The trade unions organised a manifestion in Brussels against the pension plans of the federal government. Depending on the source 50,000 to 80,000 protestors took part.
* A police chase of human trafficers who were transporting 30 people in a van ended badly, when the police shot at the van when it tried to hit a blockade. A two year old girl of Kurdish origin was killed by a police bullet.

EDIT: The Prime Minister ordered an inquiry to the shooting incident where the forementioned girl died.

Absolutely not. In fact I state the contrary.

Care to show what is wrong?

&gt;&gt; But I don‚Äôt see how that is related to this conversation.

&gt; It is related to your insinuation that there is still ""a risk"" of violence or extermination or massacre or what have you. 

How is territories in Eastern Turkey related to the existence of risks against the Armenian nation today? I didn't make any such connections at all and I don't even see any relation there. It doesn't even make sense. No, the risk is in some ideologies and lack of acceptance of what was done in the name of similar ideologies in the past and I am not only talking about Turkey here.

&gt; &gt; You talk about homogeneity of others and yet all identities, including the Turkish identity, seek homogeneity one way or another, whether it be national, ethnic, religious and some even (have) attempt(ed) racial. This is human condition, belonging to a group.

4540,"Well, regulation doesn't have to be all bad per se, imho. It's a little bit of a clickbait title, but it's not Reuters who said it. Digital minister Matt Hancock uttered those words.

But trying to tackle online child exploitation/bullying/trolling isn't a bad thing, to be honest. I think most of us agree on that. We regulate those things in the real world as well.

The question is, how far will the government go in its desire to regulate those things? And there lies the real danger. There's always a chance of [overregulating](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/porn-block-ban-in-the-uk-age-verifcation-law) or using laws for things they weren't meant for.

Besides that, it's quite impossible not to infringe certain freedoms and (human) rights when one is trying to regulate stuff like this.

**Edit**: Really? Downvotes? I'm not in favor of regulations, any regulation, either. Unless it's necessary and there aren't any other options. Not just regarding this issue, but in general.

However, there *is* a problem, a rather huge problem, with online child exploitation. If you don't think there is a problem or that we shouldn't deal with it, well, then, fuck that. We disagree.

A massive queue to find long term rental up to 5 years and the people who queue live in short term rentals usually no more than 1 year in one apartment before they need to move due to rental restrictions.

The country is almost empty, population is low in sweden but there is only housing for buyers, while renters are either kicked out of the country because they can't find apartment(foreigners) or live in precarious conditions without knowing where they will live 1 year later.

The system in sweden is designed for buyers while renters need to queue for years almost a decade in some cities. The second hand market(short term rentals) are full of scams of people who in desperation pay in advanced for fake rental contracts.

I have met people who had to move 11 times in 10 years until they got their first hand contract (long term apartment).

The situation in the so called best country on earth is a masacre to people who cannot afford to buy. They are stuck in second hand rentals (short term) because it's the only way. There is no security, there is always the possibility of being scammed and you can get kicked out at any moment. Not to mention you end up paying even double the money for second hand due to the massive competition to get those short term rentals.

My response was to the other user's claim. It can't be taken out of this context.

&gt; Care to show what is wrong?

The wrong bit is that it is not limited to destroyed a specific group in its entirety. If this were the case, what happened to the Armenians wouldn't be genocide by your definition because the Ottoman policies were only directed at Ottoman territory rather than the entire Armenian population in the region which Turkish forces did get the chance to take action against by 1920.

By the UN definition even a restricting it to a limited geography can be sufficient to level a genocide allegation. You also build it on the idea of a nationality and ignore religious and other cultural stuff. Not to mention just skin color etc.

&gt; How is territories in Eastern Turkey related to the existence of risks against the Armenian nation today? I didn't make any such connections at all and I don't even see any relation there. It doesn't even make sense. No, the risk is in some ideologies and lack of acceptance of what was done in the name of similar ideologies in the past and I am not only talking about Turkey here.

The same can be said of Armenian nationalists who preach bloody murder against Azeris and stuff. Recognition would not help with any of that in the slightest. If anything, it'd fan talk of massive reparations and aggression to acquire them.

The homogeneity I was referring to was that which is pushed for by nationalism. This is what every Ottoman successor did. None of that is comparable to the US.

What somebody verbally said is hard to have proof about, so very rarely it would be a clear case.

Or is this law supposed to be applied like parking tickets? But then it's useless in general. As unlike cars, what you said will not sit idly in the air for 15 minutes until an official arrives and hears it.

Also, is it usual for fines in France to increase with time? Sounds like a sure way to punish those that don't have much money even more.

Then you can pay 180 in a week)",Germany,/r/europe/comments/8krdw1/france_to_fine_men_up_to_750_for_wolfwhistling_or/dz9ylnw/,Alcobob,1526808040

4619,"First I don‚Äôt know why you personalize this, what I wrote is exactly what genocide is about and it doesn‚Äôt only relate to nations, but any group of people with specific characteristics, such as ethnic, racial and religious. A collective human experience where they share common characteristic which makes them a group. Such groups are the result of human condition. 

Second, this is not a zero sum or binary ‚Äúx is worth protecting more than y‚Äù, no one says it nor did I say such a thing. However genocide is viewed as being a more harmful act in civilization than a massacre because as I said you destroy a group forever including destroying forever their specific religious, ethnic, racial or national groups with their history, their language, customs, manners, worldview, etc. It simply is more harmful not only to the group but to the world at large. 

Collective human experiences are part of human heritage and are protected just like how material heritage resulting of the experiences of these same specific groups is highly cherished protected (and yet they are loathed and destroyed within the mindset of genocide). You talk about ‚Äúsimply human life and experience‚Äù and yet that very human life and *experience* is what is targetted, harmed and affected forever at the level of the group and lost possibly forever at the level of civilization. 

You talk about homogeneity of others and yet all identities, including the Turkish identity, seek homogeneity one way or another, whether it be national, ethnic, religious and some even (have) attempt(ed) racial. This is human condition, belonging to a group. 

Re your example of Armenian territories in Turkey that would of course be a very harmful act against the people who live there if their lives were to be negatively affected. But I don‚Äôt see how that is related to this conversation. I never said that the victim group should get carte blanche to carry out acts against civilization. 

‚Äúat all periods of history genocide has inflicted great losses on humanity‚Äù - preamble of the Genocide Convention. 

And yes I didn‚Äôt touch on ‚Äúwho started first‚Äù.

Edit: genocides were lawful in the past because people were subjects of the state and the state was fully sovereign. Just as a state could decide to massacre some of its subjects and no one could hold the state responsible it just happens that states could also destroy a group as such in the same manner. With advances in technology etc this became a more plausible thing to do to resolve political issues. The world at large realized that groups would get destroyed left and right and this would cause great losses to civilization at large. That‚Äôs roughly how the concept of genocide and it‚Äôs international prohibition came to be - with a lot of resistance from would be empires, specially the US.",,/r/europe/comments/8kk3cq/today_is_pontian_greek_genocide_remembrance_day/dz9yrc0/,Idontknowmuch,1526808456

And yet the world runs to take advise from those who will wheel and deal and accept more money on the promise of their return to power.

That was a thing the US regulary engaged in long before the Clintons were relevant. I'd be surprised if it actually stopped under any US administration no matter if it were republicans or democrats. Doesn't answer my question though.

There is more than enough ""proof of intent"" on the Armenian genocide, whose intents can be understood simply by looking at the way it played out. The death of more than a million people and the systematic targeting they faced is more than enough evidence to point to the intent of the perpetrators. If you're looking for written orders on the extermination of the Armenian people, they're probably hidden in some vault, never to see the sun.

Having said that, I would accept calling the actions of the Greek army a genocide, if enough traction is generated to support such thing.

[*The Atlantic*: Don't Outlaw Catcalling](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/11/dont-outlaw-catcalling/382323/)

&gt;Catcalling laws would criminalize speech, a clear violation of the First Amendment.

[*Fortune*: France Wants to Outlaw Catcalling. Here's Why the U.S. Shouldn't.](http://fortune.com/2017/08/31/france-catcalling-street-harassment-marlene-schiappa/)

&gt;As someone who met her husband walking down a New York City street, I appreciate the fine line between harassment and normal human interaction. One marginalizes a woman and makes her feel like a subhuman object, and the other is an equal matchup.
&gt;
&gt;So when France‚Äôs secretary for gender equality, Marlene Schiappa, proposed making street harassment a crime, you would think I‚Äôd jump up and cheer and wish it were the case in this country. But I didn‚Äôt and I won‚Äôt.
&gt;
&gt;As protected under the Constitution, we have the right, however moronic, to say what we‚Äôd like. And as much as hearing something repulsive hurts, it‚Äôs more important to maintain this right than to make exceptions to it.

**Underage Sex**

France:

You can, depending upon circumstance, have sex with a kid of any age without a rape penalty.

&gt;However, France's lower parliament stopped short of setting a legal age of sexual consent and instead approved a clause in which relations between an adult and a minor under 15 could be classified as rape if ""the victim lacks the ability to consent"".

-

&gt;Women's rights groups, who pushed for a firm age limit, reacted angrily to the vote.

US:

While state laws vary in detail, it's normal for those below a certain age to be considered legally automatically unable to consent; this starts between ages 16 and 18, depending upon state, and those beneath it to have been subject to statutory rape.

One of my favorite examples to post of hard US laws is Louisiania's law for dealing with those who have sex with someone below thirteen years old.  To repeat:

http://law.justia.com/codes/louisiana/2006/146/78529.html

&gt;¬ß42. Aggravated rape
&gt;
&gt;A. **Aggravated rape is a rape committed upon a person** sixty-five years of age or older or **where the anal, oral, or vaginal sexual intercourse is deemed to be without lawful consent of the victim because it is committed under any one or more of the following circumstances**:

[snip]

&gt;(4) **When the victim is under the age of thirteen years. Lack of knowledge of the victim's age shall not be a defense.**

[snip]

&gt; D.(1) Whoever commits the crime of aggravated rape shall be punished by life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.
&gt;
&gt;(2) However, **if the victim was under the age of thirteen years**, as provided by Paragraph A(4) of this Section:
&gt;
&gt;(a) **And if the district attorney seeks a capital verdict, the offender shall be punished by death or life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, in accordance with the determination of the jury.** The provisions of C.Cr.P. Art. 782 relative to cases in which punishment may be capital shall apply.
&gt;
&gt;(b) **And if the district attorney does not seek a capital verdict, the offender shall be punished by life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.** The provisions of C.Cr.P. Art. 782 relative to cases in which punishment is necessarily confinement at hard labor shall apply.

Also, note that when Lousiana says ""at hard labor"", they've made use of an old plantation that used to run on slave labor and you get to pick cotton and the like overseen by men with rifles for the rest of your life, just like slaves once did. Slaves at least had a chance of being freed, but you won't be leaving except in a body bag.  Slavery remained constitutional under the US Constitution as a legal punishment for committing crimes when it was otherwise abolished in the US:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution

&gt;Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
&gt;
&gt;Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, **except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted**, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.
&gt;
&gt;Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.

Also, in the cases where sentenced to death, in some cases, the appeal process can keep people alive on death row for a long time:

&gt;According to Louisiana Department of Corrections policy, inmates on death row are held in solitary confinement during the entire time they are incarcerated, even if appeals take years.

So either life slavery without chance of parole if the jury or prosecutor feel lenient or solitary confinement until execution otherwise.

The wide difference between what France and the US consider reasonable is interesting ‚Äî the US holds it to be very important that people can say what they want and that there is a strong expectation on the listener to be accepting of speech, including wolf whistles, whereas France is doling out fines.  On the other hand, France is unusually permissive when it comes to sex with children, whereas the US will come down on people like a sledgehammer for doing so.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8krdw1/france_to_fine_men_up_to_750_for_wolfwhistling_or/dz9z4tc/,vokegaf,1526809439

Propaganda? ever heard of losing a war? that's what osman empire did and how Bessarabia got to Russian Empire as a result of treaty. There are 2 sides to each story and if you just heard one it doesn't make the second one ""propaganda"".

&gt;Russia intentionally sent a part of its population in Basarabia to dilute the majority held by romanians.

so what 

&gt;First of all, soviet influence ( aka communism ) was absolutely disastrous for Romania starting with 1945. Things only got a bit better after a destalinisation process that started in 1965 ( after YOU killed Dej with radiation ) only to get worse again in 1980 (but that's another story)

I don't justify that, USSR politics were a mess. Don't know much about it, you are probably right.

It's like for example with a person you know, who always arrives later than promised and sometimes even breaks a promise. That person was not, legally speaking, breaking anything binding and well within their rights to arrive whenever they pleases. That has still nothing to do with your personal opinion about them.
It's great that you know that that person can do that, but reliability is NOT about that. I don't expect someone to be reliably unreliable, unless when being ironic.

4695,"&gt;I believe in a meritocratic society, where success is determined by one's ability.

And still, you want to limit these abilities by senseless regulations like taxes for the rich.

&gt;Living from a rent is considered immoral in most of the world's societies.

Who is living from a rent while doing nothing? No one.

&gt;""He who does not work, neither shall he eat"" is written in the Bible

Isn't it hypocritical and ironic to cite from Bible by communist?

Btw. It means that if you don't work then you don't earn money which ultimately means you don't have anything to eat. It certainly doesn't mean you should work whole life. You absolutely can work for a small fraction of your life and if you earned enough wealth, you can decide not to work.

&gt; People with inherited wealth consume most of the Earth's resources when the majority of them contribute nothing.

The absolute lie from your side.

People with inherited wealth will soon lose it if they aren't doing anything and that even means they contribute to the economy much more than the average person because they put their inherited wealth to meet their often extravagant and expensive needs. They are just giving money to others and at the same time doing nothing. However, those people are only a few in world population.

On the other side, if people with inherited wealth continue to work then they are enriching not only themselves but for whole society because they are continuing to do what their predecessors did before them.

&gt;The capitalism in the Czech Republic is still young, so the accumulation of wealth problem is not as serious are elsewhere.

**Accumulation of wealth is no problem. Accumulation of wealth drives humankind forward. It motives people to work because then they and their beloved ones can live good lives.** It is an opposite of what you are believing in and I already wrote you Marx' economic ideas are bullshit.

&gt;should not be at the expense of the rest of the society.

However, society mustn't limit individuals because it limits their freedom and ultimately their own existence. That is immoral, isn't it?

4697,"Yes, history is much more important than many think. Some may go ""Oh it's just things that happened in the past, it's got nothing to do with me or now, I don't need to know this."" 

Such thinking is dangerous. The existence of a *common and generally accepted history* in society is vital if we want to have *some* hope of avoiding repetition of previous generations mistakes. 

For such a recent event that took place in our own continent it's even more important that we teach youths what happened in a fair and unbiased way. Sweden have a large population of people from the former Yugoslavia, both people who arrived as a result of foreign recruitment drives in Yugoslavia during the 1960's when Sweden had a shortage of workers, and people coming as refugees fleeing the conflicts. Between 1983-2003 we received 172 204 refugees from the area, mainly Bosnians and Serbs but also Croats and Albanians.

Hence there are a great many elderly, adults, youths and children with their own history of the events, ranging from first hand experiences to stories passed down from older family members. This history is theirs, and it's important that they have it, but it must also be supplemented and countered by a neutral account of the events from school. And the same of course goes for other conflicts, both recent as well as older. We many examples of hatred between groups of people, each with their own disparate history, simmering for decades or even centuries.

Without teaching history in school we have no hope of giving young people both an insight about their own identity while also having an understanding of others.

Will the West say that they agree to violation to international law just because they dont want Ukraine having nuclear weapon - it would be silly and childish and entire world will see it. West's reputation would be completely ruined. I'm sure that the articles like ""Ukraine wants to protect itself with nukes beacuse the West failed to fulfill its obligations (doesn't matter whether they were signed on paper - they were assumed and entire world knew it)"" will appear. And everything due to the fact that Ukraine has a moral high ground here - West failed to prove that abandoning nuclear weapon was worth it. the only thing Ukraine should consider in this case is what is more beneficial - having nukes or good relationship with West. and i'm sure that Ukraine can use this as a leverage to blackmail the West: dont want us to make nukes - at least push harder on Russia.",,/r/europe/comments/8kl8ex/us_rep_to_ukraine_tells_kyiv_it_wont_recapture/dz9vunf/,mimo_shel,1526801311

Different countries have different purposes for hosting the Olympics. It is a huge status symbol to host one though, regardless of the economic costs. 

Also, host cities tend to love hosting the Olympics, as do host countries.

Yes, *walking* gets you from place A to B as well, yet not many people take it. In general public transport is dirt cheap (10-15 eur for 200km) in estonia. So unless you are dirt poor or have too much time on your hands you will choose the faster way.

Wars of expansion? In Europe? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I shudder to think of another empire that did that. The two Spains, the Byzantines, the Italian city states, the Austrians, the HRE, France (who even allied with the Ottomans to attain its goals), the Normans (whose invasion of the Byzantine Empire empowered the Osmans), Sweden, the Serbs and the Bulgarians (whose wars against the Byzantines basically  ALSO empowered the Osmans) never did that. Oh no. 

Leaving that sarcasm aside, I am struggling to remember what entities ended up bringing extremely desperate siege on themselves against an enemy that was mostly ignoring them that led to the death of a third of the local population (which they despised anyways, it was only after the siege where the Knights slightly respected the Maltese and not viewed them as some vermin they got stuck with when they lost Rhodes and got clemency by Sulieman instead of ending up all decapitated, like what happened when they encountered Timur). Well one, the Byzantines when they had the brilliant idea to release and help the brother of Mehmed the Conqueror, and look how that ended up. It's not like the islands hadn't already suffered a calamity by Dragut a few years earlier with the entire population of Gozo lost into bondage, showing the poor defense of the islands, and then was mostly quiet. 

The only reason the Knights did less damage was because they were considerably smaller (and still damaged MENA trade, but hey, war is war). The damage they left on the island especially as they started losing patronage with the Protestant Reformation was enormous and the refusal of trade with North Africa was enormously damaging. They were no different than the North African vassal states, colonies or the Osmans themselves, a bunch of bloody theocrats, a people so beloved that the idea of Malta being returned to the Knights led to the Maltese aristocracy to cry for the British to colonize us instead and almost led to another Napoleonic War.

Oh and you must be very naive to think that the Knights cared that much about Europe, the corsairs attacked Dutch, English, Spanish or French ships in the Med (though such wrongs could have been appealed at and damages had to be paid, later that applied to the Orthodox schismatics as well, before that the Greeks were slightly troubled by the Knights). The Mediterranean will always be a haven of scum, betrayal and villainy, always had been and is right now.

I'll tell you why, the other companies and other countries pick up the slack when wind turbines and solar farms are not working. Wind turbines are given priority in electricity production and the companies are even paid to NOT to produce! It is total madness.

On top of that 6000 kilometer of new power lines should be built because the turbines are in the north and the factories in the south. So far only about 100 kilometers actually built.

Solar and wind turbine power are only cheap when you externalize most of the costs to the government via subsidies and to the consumers.

Nothing comes close to nuclear with average plant life span of 60 years of energy production with 95\-98 percent of the time.

Poland and now also Austria have both installed protection transformers against the German grid on the border because the grid is so unstable they had to do it.

The number of Greek deaths using the most conservative estimates is 27577. Meanwhile, the number of Turkish deaths, using the most ""generous"" estimates and the upper ceiling of all estimates gives me 20724.

Of course, this isn't a competition and shouldn't be seen as such, but it puts things into perspective. The atrocities are of a completely different measure when compared with the Greek genocide, which had hundreds of thousands of victims dying in forced marches and labour battalions, without offering much of a strategic advantage.

4988,"Yes and No according to modern scolarship.

Rome started as Latin villages n the 8th centruy BC. It's likely that Rome was put under Etruscan control by the 6th century and organized as a Kingdom by Etruscan rulers (the walls, the cloaca maxima are all etruscan stuff). Roman historians of the Republican period have a mythical latin King founding the actual city in 753 BC, Romolus, and the basic population made up by Latins, Sabines, and Etruscans at the very beginning. But that's probably not the case.

Rome started out as Latin agricultural society ruled by the men in the families and probably a common religious leader. Mars was an agricultural God, it was turned into Ares only when the Latins entered in contact with the Greeks. ""Rome"" was probably a name connected to some divine figure (some suggest it's Flora, other say it's Amor. Consider that Latins wrote initially from left to right, They would have written Amor exactly as Roma. But that's speculation.)

A theory is that the families complying with the Etruscan rulers became Patricians and the others were made Plebeians. The Etruscan power declined and had to accept to give power to Latin figures (two consuls, tribune of the plebeians etc.) until they left Rome.

Roman authors of the Republican period didn't know how the city originated. They saw the rest of a village at the capitoline hill and assumed it was the place where Romolus and Remus grew up. 

They present the etruscan background by claiming that the last three of the seven kings of Rome were Etruscan. They turn the revolt against the etruscans into a republican revolution* against the King, followed by a shift of power to the Plebeians. It's more likely that both things were part of a process of liberation from foreign control.

*Classical Roman authors say it took place in 510-509 BC, the same year of the liberation of Athens from the Tyrants. Another weird element.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/8knpd8/greek_colonies_in_the_mediterranean_sea_circa_550/dz9qu5l/,RomanItalianEuropean,1526791567

Domestically, to my great surprise, he actually hasn't been that bad.  He has certainly been more respectful of Constitutional limits on his authority than Obama was.  In fact one of the issues we're having trouble with Europe over right now is a result of Obama's failure to follow his duty as president when making a treaty with Iran. He called it an ""agreement"" because he knew he could never get it through Congress. So really it was a deal between Obama and Iran, not a deal between America and Iran. So Trump had every right to not follow the deal because it wasn't binding on him or on America. But Europe seems upset about this.

5050,"i'm just posting this because i'm curious. i don't want to argue with anyone. wikipedia states that poland was introduced to christianity in the 10th century and became primarily christian by the 12th or 13th centuries. this doesn't seem all that long ago, at least by my sense of history. do you or do most polish people view christianity or catholicism, to be more specific, as your 'true' or indigenous religion now? isn't christianity still an abrahamic religion, a sort of sibling of islam, arising from the middle east? 

i'm approaching this subject from the perspective of an indian and a hindu, where our religion is nearly four thousand years old. we take pride in it having survived centuries of islamic and later british rule. a significant part of our religion derives from the vedas, which in turn reflects ancient indo-european religion(s) which once extended across most of europe (including poland likely) and south asia. hinduism also includes elements of other indigenous sources, apart from those deriving from the indo-aryan migration into india. so we have people who might feel more connected to the indus valley civilization which preceded (or whose tail end may have coincided with) the aforementioned migration. they might have more ancestry from earlier migrations from west asia. these are many of the dravidian groups, so even though many of them are hindus, they might maintain practices and beliefs specific to them and their regions. so even differences from nearly four thousand years ago have a kind of influence to some extent on our religion as it's practiced today. 

do polish people have such a long-ranging view of history when it comes to religion? do they still recognize or remember at all their ancestral religious traditions, or are they ""all in"" with christianity? 

this is my personal opinion, so please feel free to ignore it if you disagree. but, i feel that what's truly ""european"" or ""western"" is the enlightenment, the philosophies, the systems of political thought, the sciences, and the technologies that emerged and developed as a result of that movement. those things have advanced the human condition and human civilization in so many ways and dimensions. even those of us who are not christian or belong to the abrahamic religions, and will not take up those religions, will still take up (at least aspects of) western philosophy, and of course scientific knowledge, since the enlightenment. 

but, i guess some of the comments here made me wonder if whether some (many?) europeans actually feel more bonded to christianity/abrahamic religion than to the heritage and legacy of the age of enlightenment.

5070,"Oh, bless your soul. Let me explain. 

According to the leaked DNC e-mails, their strategy was to choose the most unlikely opposition candidate during the primaries and convince the people he had enough credibility to win. They figured when it came down to just the two of them, they'd slaughter him easily. They chose Trump. 

Most polls are financed by the DNC, their donors, or the media. The media is full of ex FBI,CIA, and DOJ people from Obama's tenure or their wives if they still work in the White house. I saw the chart once-it was creepy. Those polls said what they wanted to hear. Trump had no chance of winning, because America overall hated him.

The poll who came the closest was the Rasmussen poll. They are also the only poll that gives the presidential approval rating on a daily basis. Last week he was sitting at 47%. Today he hit the big 50! So that was a lovely accomplishment to celebrate :) His number just keeps climbing, so that's nice. 

""Friday, May 18, 2018

The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Friday shows that 50% of Likely U.S. Voters approve of President Trump‚Äôs job performance. Forty-nine percent (49%) disapprove.""  http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/trump_administration/prez_track_may18 

538 was called out publicly to answer for how they could fail so hard. They were really embarrassed. The liberal voters expected a win, and they were so angry that they had no warning. 538's credibility has never been the same. The poll to follow daily is Rasmussen. 

Mistake number 2 (you couldn't have known): You implied that his approval would fall because of the EU's disapproval. 

His numbers are going up, because we think differently as Americans. Here's a general rule of thumb. In any group of 3 or more, there is one leader, one bitch, and the rest are followers. No, the EU is not the bitch, but they aren't the leader either.

The leader's value is in his certain strength. He walks where others dare not, caring not if anyone follows. The bitch crawls and begs. The rest fall somewhere in between. Those closest to the leader are wise enough to see all the possibilities ahead and offer respectful counsel, perhaps altering the path, perhaps not, yet always valuing their position of power. Some become jealous and resentful, following further behind until one day they have to decide whether to walk away and find their own path. 

We are born into the power structure. It's why our responses are different. I'm sorry your experience was cut short. In this sub I read most posts in silence trying to learn your ways. Today was a rare day off so here I am. Perhaps after a rest, you might visit again if only to read.

&gt;**Talaat then switched the blame to the British for the Armenian killings**: ‚ÄúYou English cannot divest yourselves of responsibility in this matter. We Young Turks practically offered Turkey to you, and you refused us. One undoubted consequence has been the ruin of Christian minorities, whom your Prime Minister has insisted on treating as your allies. If the Greeks and Armenians are your allies when we are at war with you, you cannot expect our Turkish Government to treat them as friends.‚Äù

A confession is considered valuable only if it contains some true and verifiable details of the crime the investigator did not know of. Reframe the memoirs of naim bey as a confession rather than as a damaged transcription. This rule of criminal investigation was observed in the telegram transcription confessions written in The memoirs of Naim Bey.

&gt;The Memoirs of Naim Bey: Turkish Official Documents Relating to the Deportation and the Massacres of Armenians, also known as the ""Talat Pasha telegrams"", is a book written by historian and journalist Aram Andonian in 1919. Originally redacted in Armenian,[1] it was popularized worldwide through the English edition published by Hodder &amp; Stoughtons of London. It includes several documents (telegrams) that constitute evidence that the Armenian Genocide was formally implemented as Ottoman Empire policy.

&gt;The Naim Efendi memoir is genuine and the information it provides is correct. It is possible to find documents in the Ottoman archives referring to the same events and people as the memoir does. Let me give an example: In one of the parts of the memoir that is published for the first time in my book, Naim Efendi names three Armenian deportees and provides the following information, paraphrasing: ‚ÄúIstanbul sent us orders with regard to them, telling us to keep them in Aleppo and to not deport them. But the Governor sent them away and even some perished.‚Äù Naim Efendi does not provide any documentation of this order and is simply retelling from his memory. I found the telegram referring to these Armenians in the Ottoman Archives myself. I researched nearly ten similar cases and found a supple amount of documents regarding the events described in Naim Efendi‚Äôs memoir. This shows us that Naim Efendi‚Äôs memoir is genuine and that the matters that he discusses are not a fabrication at all, but in fact represent the truth.

&gt;The foundational theses put forth by Oral and Yuca regarding the fakeness of the Talat Pasha telegrams, such as the lined paper issue and especially the coding techniques, are wrong. Oral and Yuca‚Äôs claims are complete fabrications and are untrue. For this reason, we have to regard the telegrams as real until the key code notebooks are published.


Premeditated intent was present in these killings.

Are turks or the turkish state responsible for the killings and holocaust there? I honestly don't know, it's hard to attribute the guilt. But the acting government officials on several occasions abused and genocided their victims.

&gt;Trump isn't alone. The EU might stand with the country providing missiles, funds and manpower to the terrorists, but others do not. 

Who's with him? Apart from KSA and Israel. Apart from that, providing weapons, funds and manpower to terrorists is something your government has done as well. How is it different for Iran (apart from that they're not sharing the same ideals and goals as the US)?

&gt;The EU should think about all it's people, not just the few corporation owners in Iran

Funnily enough, it does. The people of the EU do not wish for another fruitless intervention in the middle east which destabilizes the region further.

&gt;""U.S. goods and services trade with the EU totaled nearly $1.1 trillion in 2016. Exports totaled $501 billion; Imports totaled $592 billion. The U.S. goods and services trade deficit with the EU was $92 billion in 2016.""

I'd say with a total of 1.1 trillion in trade, the trade deficit of 92 billion isn't that big of a deal. Not yet considered, that a trade deficit isn't necessarily something bad. So why putting tariffs on European products?

Again: Germany cannot dictate prices to EE. One company in Germany may try to gauge the market, yes. But then you simply contact another company and ask a competitive offer.

&gt;No, it doesn't work like that. You can't just switch some botton somewhere and everything is ready to go in the opposite direction. The infrastructure needs to be adjusted to reverse flow.

&gt;If Russia took such a hostile action, it would likely not be the only action. It would likely be one of many other actions, possibly even a part of an armed conflict in the Ukraine or the Baltics. I know that seems very far-fetched currently, but there are signals that the security climate in Europe is deteriorating. If the development in the future worsened to the extent that NATO fell apart, then Russia might try to exploit that situation by dividing the EU. At that point they will not care about violating trade agreements if their goal is to split up the EU completely.

If Russia is actually willing to cut gas supplies as part of broader hostile actions, then what exactly do the other EU states have to gain by showing they can be cowed by cutting gas? That will just be the first of an endless list of demands until they have to resist the unacceptable ones anway, but in a much weaker position. Furthermore, even assuming the other EU states would be willing to strike a deal akin to the Polish partiition with a military active Russia, sacrificing the EE states... then what makes you think the pipelines won't be seized militarily? Really, the whole foudnation is starting from the assumption that EU/NATO integrity is impossible in the long term - and if you start from the assumption that will happen, then it's completely sensible for Germany to have their own access, and you have no argument to demand that other states don't get the direct access EE has.

&gt;You couldn't rely on EE's noble intentions, but you could rely on EE not wanting to anger Germany too much. If there were significant tensions between EE and Russia, it would be very much in EE's interest to solve that tensions in a way that would not piss of Germany in order to have Germany's support in the overall conflict.

Since withholding gas would do that (and all the other countries on the other and the pipeline), then it's pointless for them to cling to exclusive national control of the pipelines.

&gt;This does not include Ukraine.

Well yes, but they're not neither and EU nor a NATO member so they can't expect the benefits of either. So you agree that the common EU market makes it impossible for Russia to distinguish between EU member states for gas deliveries, making it impossible to target EE specifically? That really is the main issue.

&gt;Ukraine is currently more reliant on the EU/US then anytime before. They rely on them politically but also economically. The country would go bankrupt without the support. Pissing og Germany would make no sense for Ukraine, they would do everything they could to avoid that.

You make the argument that they're reliant on the goodwill of the West, then why would they undermine that goodwill by acting as a potentially hostile state? Even assuming they should act like that, then the EU should act likewise and ensure they cannot be blackmailed by a potentially hostile state.

&gt;I'm not selling it as EE being victimized,

That's how it comes across.

&gt;I'm merely complaining about the German hypocrisy. 

If there's anyone hypocritical here it's EE that wants to keep direct access to Russian gas but wants to deny fellow EU members countries the same.

&gt;Your minister should not be dragging 'Europe' into this. This is not in EU's interests to push against these specific US sanctions. This is in Germany's interests. That's why your minister is talking about it. Why doesn't he just say so openly, instead of bullshitting about 'European response'? He doesn't have the whole EU behind him, let alone the whole Europe, he knows that very well, he just doesn't want to admit that Germany as any other country primarily cares about itself.

I'm not a German citizen, not that it matters. What does the whole thing have to do with sanctions? Gas has been excluded from those because of the mutual dependency of Russia and EU in that regard. More pipelines would increase that mutual dependency and further reduce the chance of an actual large scale armed conflict, restricting it to shellfish and specialty foods instead. This is a good thing because the military is Russia's relative strength, that's why Russia tries to use it wherever it thinks it can get away with. For example, the Russian minorities in the Baltic states would be a very likely casus belli without NATO/EU.

&gt;But yeah, I admit it, I would rather have Poland having the leverage over Germany to get them to care about any Russian hostile move against the CEE region, but that's not because I want Germany to be harmed by any of this, it's simply because I don't trust Germany when it comes to their relations with Russia. I don't trust Germany to help CEE countries against Russia under all circumstances. I trust Poland in this sense more.

Well here we are then at the core problem: trust issues. Why do you think that a military resurgent Russia would be satisfied with just one or two EU states? They would just take anything they can get. Furthermore, just giving in once would effectively dissolve NATO. If NATO doesn't react for Estonia, why would they react for Malta? Portugal? Greece? Ireland? NATO's value lies in a credible deterrent. Not reacting is to the disadvantage of every member and would invite increased testing until a new credible boundary is established. Even reasoning from a strict self-interest, that's going to cost *trillions* in military expenses from the remanining members.

Turning it around: if you think distrust is justified between EU members, then why shouldn't Germany get their own access point? After all, you imply that EU members might screw each other over at any point?

He has been brought to the fore and is supported by the Republican Party, which has climbed down a long way from the heights of Abe Lincoln or even Ike Eisenhower and is, by every metric, a party of a small, yet increasingly militant minority (that's why they restrict the franchise every chance they get) of wealthy donors and their cronies, and has no other tasks than wielding the levers of power to even further enrich their owners and lay waste to everything which even remotely benefits the smallfolk.

The reason why the GOP still supports him? Because Donald Trump forces everybody to look what nonsense is happening on the stage while the Republican machine can engineer their policy goals behind the stage where no one is looking. 

If these people see they can get away with all of this without serious consequences because they don't lose the House, the Senate or both and the Democrats won't impeach them, then we are in really dangerous territory. Because one day, it won't be a corrupt clown at the helm who bungles everything. One day, there will be a serious, honest and earnest version of Donald J. Trump.

Notably, twelve is the number of¬†month¬†in a¬†year¬†as traditionally represented both by the¬†Western and the¬†Chinese¬†and the number of months in a¬†solar calendar such as the¬†Julian one. Ultimately, this is due to the number of full¬†lunations in a¬†solar year. In any case, the number twelve is recurring as the number of a ""complete set"" or ""cosmic order"" in religious, mythological and magical traditions since antiquity.

They used their brains instead of pure strength of hands to create better world. They did much harder work than average person can do.

Even today, there are estimates that only 0,1 % of world population is pushing human kind forward.

&gt;For common people, feudalism was much worse.

Feudalism ended in 19th century and prior communist criminal regime there was prosperous Czechoslovakia with democracy.

Communist regime that destroyed lives of few generations of intelligent and progressive people who could push Czechoslovakia forward.

&gt;It is mainly thanks to technical progress

Which was basically slowed down with arrival of communist regime. Prior WWII, we were one of the strongest countries in Europe and nowadays we are average. Thanks to communism.

&gt;I am for a direct democracy and more power to the people. 

You want to be ruled by someone who doesn't even know you and your problems? Direct democracy is good for small areas like cities but not at the national level. That is why we have a representative democracy which means we are choosing experts in their respective fields (at least we should). 

Direct democracy at national level means that you should bend the knee before majority which often could be right.

Someone on Facebook did a survey about how much is a trivial mathematical example which only has addition and subtraction in it. Only 1/3 of people who answered it had it right. And those who were having it wrong, they were the loudest in persuasion they are right.

&gt;I assume that you want the opposite, right?

Democracy is arguably the best form of state so far even though it has many flaws. But direct democracy is not good idea at all for national level. It didn't work anywhere and even often-mentioned Switzerland is not that direct-democratic how disillusioned Czechs think. i have friends there and they say they vote few times a year but they have something like Parliament as well.

However, direct democracy means that if majority is wrong all will pay their price. Not only those who were wrong but also those who were right. Can we call it as freedom? I don't think so. How would it be different from a dictatorship? In no way, it would be dictatorship of majority and I don't wish to be in minority just because have different opinion.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/8kdxor/slovak_president_kiska_says_eu_countries_ignoring/dz96bp9/,DurosofBohemia,1526765321

5247,"&gt;No it isn't.

On this point - Monarchy - is quite simple. It's a position where you don't fight for it, neither you need to be good for it. You just need to be born. And it's not a simple position. It's representing a country. So, under monarchy, you chose to define the representation of your country under a family, and give them a privilege status above anyone where, because whatever reason. Or better, because a few centuries ago peasants were convinced they were chosen by god and clapped, and now you just keep clapping. 

Or the other issues you claimed have zero relevance for the Monarchy discussion. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

But I can give you my answers anyway. 

&gt;For example, did you earn the right to inherit your parents wealth?

It should be up to them to decide what should happen to their money after their death. If they don't decide, the money should be taxed and the rest divided among the direct family (i.e, children). 

&gt; Did you earn the right to be a citizen of your country?

Actually, the most interesting about this question is the fact that you describe it as a right. Is it only a right, or is an obligation? I had no other alternative besides having citizenship of my country. It was given without my consent. 

&gt;Should foreigners who were born into poverty be entitled to citizenship of your country

If they are in my country and pretend to remain, at least for a long period, they should. 

&gt;and a share of your family inheritance?

Already said that part should be taxed, so indirectly they would get it. 

&gt;Or do you feel you have more rights than them just by doing nothing besides being born? 

So, if they weren't foreigners would it be okay to receive some inheritance from my family? (My parents are quite poor, so they wouldn't receive much anyway.)

I don't even get your point in some of those questions. In a Republic you can't be a president if you don't have the citizenship of that country...

5278,"&gt;Consent of the parties

&gt;UN peacekeeping operations are deployed with the consent of the main parties to the conflict. This requires a commitment by the parties to a political process. Their acceptance of a peacekeeping operation provides the UN with the necessary freedom of action, both political and physical, to carry out its mandated tasks.

&gt;In the absence of such consent, a peacekeeping operation risks becoming a party to the conflict; and being drawn towards enforcement action, and away from its fundamental role of keeping the peace.

&gt;The fact that the main parties have given their consent to the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping operation does not necessarily imply or guarantee that there will also be consent at the local level, particularly if the main parties are internally divided or have weak command and control systems.  Universality of consent becomes even less probable in volatile settings, characterized by the presence of armed groups not under the control of any of the parties, or by the presence of other spoilers.

5294,"The agreement was never approved if it never went thru the approval process which it did not.  I can see how this might confuse a lay person on the street but for career politicians like Obama, Merkel, Macron, Tusk, Juncker the Iranians that negotiate deals between nations this must have been extremely clear to them because all countries have some sort of approval process.  I would imagine anyone in the EU in particular is extremely aware that different sovereign nations have different processes.  

If your leader led you to believe that it had been approved when they clearly understood that it was not then take that up with your leader.  However, the US will still abide by the pertinent law which is the US constitution.  

As for Trump pulling out, he clearly had a right to and he raised valid concerns and repeatedly offered to renegotiate.  Merkel and Macron agreed that he had valid concerns and agreed to renegotiate.  The Iranians point blank refused to renegotiate so the potential deal falling apart is on them not Trump.  

As for tariffs, he clearly and repeatedly said that he felt America had gotten the short end of the stick on many trade deals and issues and he made the same promise.  He will either renegotiate or end them.  He is raising valid concerns, if the EU wants to continue to do business they will negotiate in good faith and find something fair for both sides.  If not then yes you can expect Trump to unilaterally take action and yes the EU will likely take some counter actions and so on.  If that is not the route that the EU wants to go then the EU should sit and negotiate in good faith.  

In a larger sense, Trump is a strong man president.  He gets good results with enemies but he tends to rattle allies.  Obama was charismatic but weak.  He got along better with our allies because he was willing to agree to things not in the US's interest and our enemies walked all over him.  

As for keeping Trump in check, the US constitution was written at a time when most nations had strong man leaders and it has things to keep him from gaining too much power.  It is written with checks and balances to prevent anyone or any group from gaining too much power.  Term limits are one and another is that any major agreement, (such as the Paris or Iran Agreements) need approval from multiple people.  In both cases both were voted down by congress and thus were not approved which again any professional politician would have well understood.  If your politician led you to believe otherwise then take that up with them.  ",,/r/europe/comments/8kd6by/german_opinion_poll_usa_is_a_less_reliable/dz97bre/,Monitor11,1526766511

In 2012 Obama got rid of the law obligating the American media to be propaganda free and unbiased. The media made the world love Obama, yet his own congress refused to back the Iran deal and even sent a letter explaining that when he was gone, it could very well be gone as well. What did he do wrong? It was a lot of little things, but the crux of it was this: during a speech about the high unemployment rate, he said those production jobs are gone , and they're not coming back. He damned the future for a lot of people. Hillary was supposed to be Obama 2.0, but the people, the consumers with no job, no money, and no future said no more.  Trump said he'd bring those jobs back\-that's how he won. Then he proceeded to do it. 

The American president expects that each country's leader will do what's best for their own people. It's their job. It's why the people put them in power. He also said that ""America first"" does NOT mean America alone. I heard a news clip last week where he said helping North Korea to be on a par with South Korea was his goal. America could only benefit from allies willing to bring their ideas to the table as well. I can't imagine congress not backing him in this.

This is not even getting into the national consciousness and everything that comes from that which is another pandora's box. The damage is massive and risks are still massive. This is why genocide is set apart from other atrocities, not because lives lost in a massacre have any less value than lives lost in a genocide, but because a massacre is not the same to a nation than what a genocide is to a nation.

5361,"&gt; Why aren¬¥t you picking the 1913 census? That¬¥s the latest one and you get actually 1,1 million.

Are you blind? Did you not understand what I just said and the source showed about the census being intentionally falsified? 1.1 million isn't even plausible. I've heard other genocide deniers claim as low as 500,000. It's obvious falsification has taken place.

‚ÄúDuring the reign of Abdul Hamid we lowered the population figures of the Armenians. By the order of Abdul Hamid the number of the Armenians deliberately had been put in low figures.‚Äù - Kazƒ±m Kadri

&gt;I can¬¥t find it anymore, thus this is the best I could find: factcheckarmenia.com

Lmao. If that's the best you could find, you've defeated your own argument.

&gt;Just 10 years ago, people talked about the armenian genocide with victoms between 300 000 up to 1,2 million. Now everyone acts like 1,5 million died and that¬¥s a fact.

There has been estimates between 800,000 and 1,800,000. Some Turks like to claim Arnold Toynbee's estimate of 600,000, but that was only from the first year of the genocide. 1.5 million has been the most accurate figure for a lot more than 10 years. No one reliable has ever claimed 300,000, you probably got that from a Turk.

&gt;Can you prove that?

I already did, but I assume you didn't read my source. All the Ottoman census from the 1840s to the 1860s put Armenians at over 2 million in the Armenian Highlands and at almost a million in the rest of the empire.

[You should also take a look at this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Armenian_population#Arguments_of_Armenian_population_controversy).

&gt;The Sultan didn¬¥t care about the religion of its people. Abd√ºllhamid II. had an Ottoman-ideology rather than a national-turkish one. So the turkish triumvirate only had 5 years to completly change their ideology from being friendly towards armenians to wanting them to genocide.

The sultan tried to commit the Armenian Genocide decades earlier during the Hamidian massacres. After killing hundreds of thousands of Armenians, the great powers pressured him to stop. So no, it's no coincidence the Turks resumed their genocidal goals as soon as the great powers were busy fighting a world war. The Young Turks' were planning the genocide from the beginning.

&gt;Nowadays, yes, but this doesn¬¥t matter regarding 1915.

Yes it did. He wasn't a real figure of the Armenian Church, he was an Ottoman politician pretending to be.

&gt;So everything is wrong expect for the statistics of people that didn¬¥t even live in Anatolia? Do you even realize the ridiculity of your statment?

He was a figure of the Ottoman government that falsified the Armenian population numbers, so naturally he repeats the same falsified information.

&gt;Don¬¥t you wonder why the armenian diaspora never tries to bring this issue infront of a court, but tries to get recognizition by parliaments?

Nothing you just said makes any sense, this is just something the Turkish government repeats so much that Turks believe it's a real argument. Like how they also claim Turkish archives are ""open"" but leave out everything undesirable has been [removed, destroyed, sold, or otherwise disposed of](https://armenianweekly.com/2017/10/03/how-turkey-destroyed-or-disposed-its-historical-archives-and-documents/), while claiming Armenia is hiding some archives that don't exist.

&gt;Shimon Peres is turkish funded?

He doesn't claim details about the Armenian Genocide, just that ""nothing similar to the Holocaust occurred""

&gt;Hovhannes Katchazouni was turkish funded?

Perincek's translations have been proven to be forged. But like a true Turk, I'm sure you won't let facts get in the way.

&gt;Everyone is wrong expect for your side.

This is literally what everyone else jokes about Turkish lies lol.

&gt;You claimed, but didn¬¥t prove anything.

You just didn't read it. Try again.

[This is a map of the Balkan Muslim population pre Balkan Crisis of 1875](https://i.redd.it/5uaz25biwdhx.png). While it maybe a higher end estimate, it is well within the range of what historians estimate. The Muslims often formed a significant minority or plurality across most of the Empire. [This, for comparison, is the modern makeup](http://www.geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Scolbert08-Religion-Map-Balkans.png). After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the vast majority of this population was then expelled, forced to migrated, or slaughtered. It is estimated that during the Russian invasion of the Ottoman Empire and resulting events around one million people died or were displaced. An additional 1.5 million or so were either killed or displaced during the Balkan Wars. In addition to other refugees from the Caucuses and Crimea, the victims of the Russian lead geneocides against the Muslim population (see:[ Circassian genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassian_genocide)), Anatolia grew by 2.5 million Muslims, and this was subsequently the spark that lead to the following cleansing of Christian populations from Anatolia.

Going through this purgatory migration period will mess you up for a long time, mentally and socially if you do end up being accepted. 

At the same time I think Germany really overestimated their own abilities to process migrants en masse, and also over-estimated the ability of migrants from undeveloped countries to be able to mentally tolerate this kind of long, thorough, bureaucratic process. 

Of course some people probably are not going to be accepted, but Germany recognizes the problem of its demographics (declining births per household) and that they have a real palpable need for labor in the future to support their Government' services and social support (via a growing stable labor tax base).

Source for Ludovic?

It's a historically documented fact that towards the later half of the 19th century up until the genocide, the Turks falsified every population census to make it appear as though there were less Armenians than there really were. And the patriachy? Lol, the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople is not even a real position in the Armenian Apostolic Church. Constantinople was never a significant city for the church. The position was invented by the Ottomans, and the patriarch was their mouthpiece. His statistics were falsified too.

&gt;Yeah sure mate. Everyone talking slightly against it, is automatically wrong and a genocide denier.

""result of a military decision process"" and other buzz terminology = Genocide denial

Only people who are Turkish or Turkish-funded spout this bullshit. And you only cling to it because it tells you what you want to believe, not because it's credible.

&gt;Shimon Peres

Lots of Zionists deny the Armenian Genocide because they thought the Holocaust was unique and the first of its kind.

&gt;His claim implys that all Armenians died, since 1,5 million would mean the complete annhilation of Armenians in the middle east. Yet you have Armenians still in Anatolia, in Syria or armenian diasporas in latin-America that migrated from Anatolia.

As I already pointed out, the population was much higher before the Turk's own pre-genocidal figures. Also ""migrated"" is an interesting way of describing genocide survivors.

&gt;Luckly this isn¬¥t for you to decide.

Unfortunately for you, every credible person agrees with what I say.

Please, if you have any sinserity whatsoever, according to your definition of genocide, much more up-to-date example is done today by israelis. you can even watch in tv!  you wouldn't need debatable historical documents to prove it. Are you also going to support when europeans are calling it Palestinian genocide ?   I bet you wouldn't even consider it. Is there any europan country defining what Israel is doing today as genocide? Does Germany? If not you can't expect other countries to believe that people are just nor they are honest.

The term `Genocide` is first defined by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Lemkin . 

Which is basically a made up `word`. Which people felt the need, by the horrors done by the systematic and unimaginable things on ww2. 

For some recent years, Germany lead propaganda guys are trying to use this word more often. I think it would be clear for any one to comprehend, this is to change the perception of germans in the world, when you talk about genocide. Obviously with enough supporters, you have many genocider countries in histroy. Well as a bonus, also deteriote the diplomatic reputation of Turkey.

I think the word you are looking for is more general term -&gt; ethnic cleansing : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_cleansing_campaigns#1900s%E2%80%931910s

Which undoubtfully, has happened almost every where in the world over the recorded history and happening today from middle-east to china, in russia and also in europe( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_Roma_migrants_from_France ) . Some massacres/deportations are worse then others some not.  And during a messy war such as turkish greek war during 1919 - 1922 , many massacres and deportations done by both turkish and greek side. so any reasonable person, should be able to relate to turkish view, why turks will never ever going to accept such claims.

&gt; - [calls upon the government] to continue to contribute to a broad public discussion about the expulsion and almost complete annihilation of the Armenians in 1915/1916 as well as the role of the German Empire

&gt; - The German Bundestag also commemorates the events in the context of the current remembrance of World War I. The German Empire was a principal military ally of the Ottoman Empire.

Apart from that I have lived in Catalonia and half of my family is from there. I can assure you that there are no unsalvageable differences between Catalonia and the rest of Spain.

Of course he had to pull off the Succession War. He freaking had to. It's one of the indicators that he has actually no freaking idea of what he's talking about. It was a civil conflict with external influence that affected all Spain (for example the Mayor of Madrid was on the Austrian side and the Mayor of Barcelona was killed by the English after siding with the French). Certainly most of the Crown of Arag√≥n sided with the Austrians and got defeated but the institutions they lost were not that important and actually after that they got into a tremendously good economical period.

Of course, he skips from there to Franco as it would be very inconvenient to mention the time between those periods for him. He conveniently forgot the Spanish Independence War where we ALL fought together against Napoleon (and Catalonia was independent during the period Napoleon conquered it) until we kicked him out and got back our sovereignty together. He also conveniently forgot the First Spanish Republic, which had two Catalan Presidents.

He also did not mention the investments done in Catalonia to empower it during the last centuries that weakened other regions of Spain. Stendhal mentioned several times the unfairness of this and the privileges Catalans had back then. Of course, when protectionism was lifted off was when Catalan Nationalism started to appear. For reference, this was in the 1880s and this was when 11 of September started to be mythified and celebrated.

11 of September was declared Day of Catalonia in recent democracy (in my opinion to whore conflict for political interests). As it is always good for their position to talk about how the ""horrible Spaniards invaded, raped and killed us"". 4 years ago it was the 300th anniversary of that day and they did not waste resources to politicize it as much as possible (and use it on children of course).

You are too far off with that number you gave. Try a few million of Turks killed not a few hundred thousand. The Armenian, Greek, Assyrian death toll looks like peanuts compared to that. There is a link above where you can read about this.


You should also read about Circassian Genocide and Crimean Tatar Genocide too. While you're at it you should also read about genocide of other non-Turkish Muslim groups in former Ottoman territories. Ethnic cleansing / genocide of Muslims in Balkans for example.

Because today these ethnic groups (Circassian, Tatar, Albanian, Bosniak and etc.) make up an extremely huge chunk of the modern Turkish society. Millions of Turkish citizens have a refugee background from these regions. Ancestors of these people were driven out their homes from regions like Crimea, Circassia, Crete, Balkans, Romania, Caucasia and bunch other regions. 

Those who were lucky made it to Turkey and those unlucky died either due to massacres or horrible conditions forced upon them, lack of food, water and bad weather conditions or simply drowning due to being forced to row from one side of the Black Sea to the other side. During WW1 the genocides of these ethnic groups served as a reminder to Turks of what would happen to them in Turkey if they lost the war against Armenians, Greeks and Russians.

Expect it is. Ironically no one accused Turkey of anything up to the 1950th/1960th. Decades after the incidence, people started talking about genocides in Anatolia. Long after the people that were responsible for it, died. 

&gt;No it's not. it's part of what they included as an ""extra"" that include a recent quote of the president, newspapers of that era and so on. A full version can be found here.

Read your fucking source please. Literally the first sentance is repeating the exact same thing I quoted. 

&gt;No. They ""are convicted"" according to the resolution. Don't pick quotes, use the resolution text.

Holy shit man... How can you be this blind and ignorant about your own source. I will quote YOUR SOURCE:

""""It is believed that in Turkey between 1913 and 1922, under the successive regimes of the Young Turks and of Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk), more than 3.5 million Armenian, Assyrian and Greek Christians were massacred in a state-organized and state-sponsored campaign of destruction and genocide, aiming at wiping out from the emerging Turkish Republic its native Christian populations. ""

BELIEVED. Again. It is literally the first sentance. Holy shit man...

&gt;They said: ""be it resolved that it is the conviction of the IAOGS that the Ottoman campaign [...] consisted a genocide against Armenians, Assyrians, and Pontian and Anatolian Greeks.""

CONVICTION =/= facts. There is the conviction that god exists, but there is no proof for it. I believe I am a genius, yet I am not.

5662,"Just copying my comment from /r/worldnews:

A local guy here. It's way more complicated than the article implies. The administrative reform changed the way local bus networks are arranged, there are now regional public transport centres. There are at least four major problems with the ""free public transport"":

Each of the regional public transport centres can decide if they take free transport (covered by the state) or not. The problem is that the state only offers a fixed sum and clear rules ‚Äì must be free for everyone. So if you wanted to make it free for e.g. pensioners and students, you get no money whatsoever.

Only regional lines are offered this. The more important long-distance lines, e.g. between the largest towns of the country, remain priced. This also creates absurd situations where in some stretches, subsidized lines compete with commercial ones, which I would call unfair competition. Not to mention that trains are also not included in the project.

Public transport's main problems are often the non-aligning schedules or outdated routes, which are still not dealt with.

Also, bus tickets were never expensive, the price was rarely the issue. I hardly believe it will change car-users' behaviour at all.

This is the PM's party project, which was also their election promise. I personally don't believe in it as it feels very rushed, not thought-trough, the quality of public transport is forgotten over price (which wasn't that much of an issue) etc.",Eesti,/r/europe/comments/8kk430/estonia_will_roll_out_free_public_transit/dz8hqwq/,toreon,1526736599

There's nothing to deny if there wasn't a genocide to begin with. Civilists died on both sides it was a fight between opressor against oppressed. Opressing someone isn't the same as a genocide.

Being threathed the same, whith equal chances doesent mean you need to habe the same income. It means you dont need to be punished for earning more. But ok dude, you go and ask for same income.

&gt;You shouldn't be punished for not being born into wealth (the number one reason for ending up wealthy and successful later in life is the class you were born in, rather than your ""hard work"", the ""self-made man"" is an American myth)

You shouldnt be punished for earning more wealth either.

&gt;Sure, insolent foreign fuckwad, I'll do that, since this used to be my job.

Then is good that it used to be your job. Because you are dumb.

&gt; For one, unemployment benefits (WW) as a percentage (70%-75%) of last earned monthly ""SV""-income.

You receive 70 of you wage in the first 2 months and 75% of your wage after that no matter your income tax percentage. You dont receive more % of the wage just because you are in the higher income tax bracket.

1) The big cities are populated by a lot of people who share a lot of European values and have a european lifestyle. The vast majority of smaller villages are backward as fuck.

2) Europe is in the exact same position as the German (and Italian) states were before 1871. Nobody thought they could unite, but they did and formed the strongest and most stabilizing political entity in the world. There were almost 40 years of peace (at least in **Western** Europe) following that. I dream of a European Union, where all our squabbling nations really unite. The European States of Europe would be the greatest stabilizer in the world right now. Imagine a european run nation on the doorstep of the middle East, it would be a major stabilizing force for the region. No persecution of political dissident, no persecution of Kurds that aren‚Äôt complying with Erdogan, no shopping for land in Syria. If the Middle East gets better, Europe (and the world) gets better.

However, with the egomaniac dictator in charge now, nothing will change for the better.

5925,"&gt;	The USA gains massively by providing security far outside its borders and allows more countries to participate in the global trade network NATO and other first world nations maintain. To then turn around and claim ‚Äúlol jk‚Äù with the America First slogan is so god damn dumb I have no idea how this idiot got voted in. The world is becoming more and more global every year. It‚Äôs only natural that countries which share strong military and economical ties don‚Äôt close eachother off from established deals and agreements just because of a switch of administration.

You aren‚Äôt seeing the situation clearly from our perspective, which is that everyone else benefits far more than we do. Do you not see the trade deficit we have with all of our ‚Äòallies‚Äô? Notice how the main countries taking issue with US trade policy (Mexico, Germany, China) are all massive exporters who depend on the US market?

We voted for him because the status quo is draining us dry and is not sustainable in any way. Something has to change, and telling Americans that they should stick with the crappy deals that they have and not rock the boat too much is not very compelling.

America first is not America only or whatever you have in your mind. It means rationally prioritizing your people first, as any country should do.

&gt;	Mexico has huge poverty problems. How exactly do you get elected as a Mexican politician by promising to cut and control the only way some Mexicans can thrive in richer societies? You can‚Äôt.

No wonder you don‚Äôt like these policies, you‚Äôre one of those people that thinks America ‚Äòbelongs to everyone‚Äô or whatever bullshit. No, people are not the same, and if we took in everyone from South America, we‚Äôd end up looking exactly like South America.

It‚Äôs amazing how you can sit there with a straight face and say this globalist garbage is ‚Äògood for America‚Äô while at the same time claiming ‚Äòborders are bullshit‚Äô. You can‚Äôt speak on what is good for countries when you don‚Äôt even think they should exist...

5928,"&gt;I hope you understand the difference between vanishing and being under attack.

I'm pretty sure pre-civil war US slaves and Jews in Nazi Germany would disagree with you. All these values *did* vanish for *them* at those points in time. They weren't very prominent for them. I dare you to ask a surviving Jew.

I never said they vanished completely for *everybody* at the same time.

&gt;In Europe alone there have been plenty of them - in the last century alone. In fact, one terminated in a bloodbath in living memory. 

And there we have it! This is what I was hoping to read in the morning.

You're literally stating that the EU is the new Nazi empire. Why didn't you just say it right away? It's not like I haven't heard that one before. Do they explain the differences between the EU and Nazi Germany in that book of yours?

Zakaria himself mentions abandoning values himself as well, by the way:

&gt;The [center](https://fareedzakaria.com/columns/2017/02/24/dont-despair-the-center-can-still-win-in-europe) can win. Europe is not inexorably heading down a path of right-wing nationalism that **abandons** the European Union, economic integration, the Atlantic alliance and **Western values**.

According to Cambridge Dictionary ""abandon"" means ""to leave a place, thing, or person, usually for ever"". That sounds an awful lot like vanishing.

Zakaria concludes:

&gt;If the United States encourages **the destruction** of core Western institutions and ideals, then the West might well unravel. But this would not be one of those stories of civilizational decline in the face of external threats. It would be a self-inflicted wound ‚Äî one that might be fatal.

I hope you understand the difference between being under attack and abandonment and destruction.

I find it rather ironic that you're calling *me* an alarmist while *you* are the one talking about a (bloody) civil war if this EU continues to exist. And now you're even comparing it to the Third Reich. 

And I'm the alarmist? 

You seem to be projecting a lot. You may sound eloquent, but that doesn't make you reasonable per se. Quite the opposite. In my humble opinion, people comparing the EU to Nazi Germany are quite radical. Especially when they state it will all end in a bloody civil war.

When I stated that this wave of idiocy is a threat to the EU, I merely meant that it could bring it down. It could mean the end of the EU. You're the one bringing up bloody civil wars and comparing the EU to Nazi Germany.

Origin:

&gt;There are separate Spanish and Sardinian traditions to explain the origin of the flag and there is no consensus among scholars as to which is correct. According to the Spanish tradition, it was a creation of King Peter I of Aragon, celebrating his victory at the Battle of Alcoraz in 1096. It was said that St. George miraculously appeared on the field of battle and that there were four severed heads of Saracen kings at the end; thus the red cross and white background of the St George's Cross and the heads of four Moors.
