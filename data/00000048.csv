Besides, our privilege does not end there. As a citizen of a highly developed countries we had the opportunity to receive tertiary education. 50% of Africans wasn't even taught how to read.  


Moreover, both of us are EU citizens and are free to simply move to Germany, Netherlands, Norway or whatever country we find better. From the day zero after the move, you would have unconditional work permit, so permit-related exploitation is something you would never encounter.

19,"Sure its an oversimplification, but in general people were Austrian, but saw themselves primarily as Carniolan, Styrian, Carinthian (regions in today Austria and Slovenia). 

Language was a smaller part of identity, similar as e.g. religion. People had a strong regional identity, which still exists today.

Sloven national identity was developed relatively late, and didn't exist as such in 1850,
especially as each region, valley had its own dialect. There were 3 different ""slavic"" language standards used at the time (carniolan, west-styrian, transmuranian).

Slovens in general are not only slavic, so there are different influences in different areas. But slavic is the strongest one, so that was the unifying part, yes. 

Contrary to popular belief, it was the Austrian monarchy that did most to create a Slovene national identity. To reduce birocracy they merged those 3 different language standards into one, and later started teaching at schools that people living here are slovens.

Then with world wars and everything else, the anti Italian and anti German sentiment only grew and the with it the nation identity.",,/r/europe/comments/kl4uw2/slovenian_fairytale/gh9zemr/,KrainerWurst,1609150101

You're saying that the there is 1,5 million more Greeks with ancestry from the islands without proving it any way so that's just bull. Also, ""partial islander ancestry"" doesn't change anything.

I never said that Greece was fully slavic or arvanite. I said they have been influenced enough by these people and they in turn have been influenced by Greek culture in return and that has resulted in the Balkan countries having many things in common. But yeah sure keep believing our culture and traditions are more similar to the Portuguese, for instance. When was the last time you ate a fransesihna or a pastel de nata? Maybe you don't dance tsamiko but the people of Peloponnese do and when they do it in traditional costumes, they do it wearing the Balkan foustanella. Orthodox Greece is so culturally similar to Italy, Spain and Portugal. Yeai sure. There are similarities with them too sure but most of our similarities are with the Balkans.

I challenge to go back to your genealogical tree. Given how many of them were in Peloponnese there's no way you won't find a single Arvanite in it. You did make references to purity by the way. Wasn't that what you meant when you said your ancestry was fully from Ilia? Didn't you mean you are fully Greek by that?

You've posted in AltGreece, you've posted white-nationalist idiotic propaganda, the anthem of a fascist Romanian organization and a post claiming with no sources again that Greek blonde people are somehow not rare and people on that post called you out for being an alt-right nationalist.

94,"He called out Nazi Germany for their anti Semitic ways well before many people realized they were a problem. I am not going to say that he didn't use a stereotype, because he did (although you should note that almost all the jewish stereotypes are also identical to the dwarves from Germanic Mythology; the very site you link says as much) . But I also think that it should be noted that he almost gave up a huge payday because Germany was saying anti semitic things, and he didn't want to publish the Hobbit there because his Jewish friends were pissed. He also made the dwarves the good guys, and considering they were almost unilaterally the bad guys in fiction at the time, that is a huge step forward. Could he have done better? Obviously. But I think he is a far cry from being anti semitic. Tolkien was flawed in some of his portrayals, but I do not think the man was anti semitic.  He was a white anglo-saxon man born in South Africa prior to WW1, portrayed an otherwise disenfranchised people as blatantly the good guys and put a cool spotlight on some aspects of their culture that is otherwise ignored, gave a woman a combat role (""I am no man"") in a time where it was still frowned upon for a woman to have a job, and opposed the Nazis and Apartheid.

Mine was a book *recommendation*, I never claimed Cottarelli possesses the truth in his hands, although his argumentations are supported by a variety of academics and economists with high credentials, even from different school of thought 

On the other hand Bagnai and Borghi are mediocre economists at best who have gained their notoriety through the fact that they are *known by the public* rather than being respected by actual academists or economists. 

And you know why I think they are mediocre and I have never changed my idea? Because they **actively avoid** debating with economists, they block them on twitter to avoid confront, (yet they spend their time replying to ""random"" people with no credentials who are ideologically different from them just to be able to ""prove"" that whoever comes from a different school of thought in econ is wrong lol); the few time it happened in the past they tried to divert the conversation by ""buttarla in caciara"" because the debate was going one way with them being proved false time and time again, not to mention that their ""theories"" are problematic at best and unfalsifiable and anti-scientific at worst, considering that they basically advocate for MMT

You know how the avoid the burden of being rejected by academists?

131,"Iberia has higher levels of North African admixture than is found in the rest of the European continent,[5] (from this study it follows that the contribution of northern African lineages to the entire male gene pool of Iberia, continental Italy, and Sicily can be estimated as 5.6%, 3.6%, and 6.6%, respectively ) which is largely ascribed to settlement during the Carthaginian and Islamic periods

In terms of autosomal DNA, the most recent study regarding African admixture in Iberian populations was conducted in April 2013 by Botigu√© et al. using genome-wide SNP data for over 2000 European, Maghreb, Qatar and Sub-Saharan individuals of which 119 were Spaniards and 117 Portuguese, concluding that Spain and Portugal hold significant levels of North African ancestry. Estimates of shared ancestry averaged from 4% in some places to 10% in the general population

a prior 2011 autosomal study by Moorjani et al. found Sub-Saharan ancestry in many parts of southern Europe at ranges of between 1-4%, ""the highest proportion of African ancestry in Europe is in Iberia (Portugal 4.2¬±0.3% and Spain 1.4¬±0.3%), consistent with inferences based on mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosomes and the observation by Auton et al. that within Europe, the Southwestern Europeans have the highest haplotype-sharing with North Africans

In terms of paternal Y-Chromosome DNA, recent studies coincide in that Iberia has the greatest presence of the typically Northwest African Y-chromosome haplotype marker E-M81 in Europe, with an average of 3%

Estimates of Y-Chromosome ancestry vary, with a 2008 study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics using 1140 samples from throughout the Iberian peninsula, giving a proportion of 10.6% North African ancestry

A similar 2009 study of Y-chromosome with 659 samples from Southern Portugal, 680 from Northern Spain, 37 samples from Andalusia, 915 samples from mainland Italy, and 93 samples from Sicily found significantly higher levels of North African male ancestry in Portugal, Spain and Sicily (7.7%, 7.1% and 7.5% respectively) than in Italy (5.7%

Other studies of the Iberian gene-pool have estimated significantly lower levels of North African Ancestry. According to Bosch et al. 2000 ""NW African populations may have contributed 7% of Iberian Y chromosomes""

 A wide-ranging study by Cruciani et al. 2007, using 6,501 unrelated Y-chromosome samples from 81 populations found that: ""Considering both these E-M78 sub-haplogroups (E-V12, E-V22, E-V65) and the E-M81 haplogroup, the contribution of northern African lineages to the entire male gene pool of Iberia (barring Pasiegos), continental Italy and Sicily can be estimated as 5.6 percent, 4.6 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively""

A 2007 study estimated the contribution of northern African lineages to the entire male gene pool of Iberia as 5.6%.

 In general aspects, according to (Bosch et al. 2007) ""...the origins of the Iberian Y-chromosome pool may be summarized as follows: 5% recent NW African, 78% Upper Paleolithic and later local derivatives (group IX), and 10% Neolithic"" (H58, H71)

Mitochondrial DNA studies of 2003, coincide in that the Iberian Peninsula holds higher levels of typically North African Haplotype U6,[9][33] as well as higher frequencies of Sub-Saharan African Haplogroup L in Portugal.[34][35][36][37] High frequencies are largely concentrated in the south and southwest of the Iberian peninsula, therefore overall frequency is higher in Portugal (6.8%) than in Spain (1.9%) with a mean frequency for the entire peninsula of 3.8%.

The most recent and comprehensive genomic studies establish that North African genetic ancestry can be identified throughout nearly the whole Iberian Peninsula, ranging from 0%-11%

*Not a lot of studies to go on so the real answer probably lies somewhere between the 11% and the 20% that those two concluded.*

&gt;
&gt;""There was a terrible rumble and then it shook. I was terribly scared,"" said the citizen of Kutina.

330,"While you are right about the assertions in the video being baseless, there are some strong elements in the books that are seen as potentially racist.

There is a strong theme about the pure, powerful, ""Men of the West‚Äù, the Numenoreans, and the ""hordes of the East"". The Haradrim and Easterlings are described as swarthy, sallow-skinned, and other darker skin tones. The oliphaunts (Mumakil in the language of Harad) are clearly war elephants, which are generally associated with Carthage and North Africa (though Carthage was Phoenician in origin).

Near Harad was more brown skinned, the ""half-trolls"" of Far Harad having black skin (also, Far Harad being the origin of the elephants). They often wield scimitars, have lots of scarlet robes and golden ornamentation...

The descriptions of the corrupted men who aided Sauron and earlier foes of Middle-Earth seem to have pretty clearly been inspired by North Africa, the Near East/Middle East, and possibly some ""Mongol Hordes of Asia"". The languages might be less so, but their physical descriptions, weapons, animals, and descriptions of cultures seems to be derived from an amalgamation of several of those cultures. Maybe some Seljuk Turk influences, but really, he's borrowing from a whole corpus of history.

It's fairly common in Western fantasy to have hordes of barbarians, steppe nomads, and have those opposed to the protagonists, since so much inspiration is derived from Western history, which has experience with ""exotic"" war elephants, steppe nomad invasions, and so forth. The association in LotR with evil in the form of Sauron, and the other negative descriptions of them as having been corrupted, leads to accusations of racism (good men of the west vs. evil, dark skinned barbarians hordes).

Likewise, he initially described Orcs as ""squat, broad, flat-nosed, sallow-skinned, with wide mouths and slant eyes: in fact degraded and repulsive versions of the (to Europeans) least lovely Mongol-types.""  Which would clearly be racist descriptions of East Asians. However, he changed the origins and appearance of orcs over time.

There's much more to language, but much is thematic, and I don't think it necessarily speaks to personal racism; he was adamantly opposed to Nazi racism, anti-Semitism, and to anti-black racism in South Africa and elsewhere. And while he generally describes the Haradrim and the Easterlings in bad terms, he also is sure to humanize them as well- Samwise Gamgee's consideration of a dead Haradrim soldier is poignant, as he wonders about the man's name, and what led him to march north, and die so far from his home, and if he was truly evil of heart.

TL;DR Lots of inspirations from history and Eastern/African/ME civilizations for some of the ""bad guys"" in Middle-Earth, but this may not be indicative of personal racism, or that his depictions of those cultures in the books reflected his personal feelings about them.",,/r/europe/comments/kl68ll/tolkien_quote_about_the_finnish_language/gh9cf5g/,TakoyakiBoxGuy,1609129822

The important part was that he refused to return. That is what makes it functionally equivalent to fleeing. The incincerity was just extra.

So what you're saying is that he didn't flee, but rather didn't return after finding out they were after him.  
Also, he turned himself over to British police less than a month after *fleeing*.

&gt;Which is exactly what I said. The claim that the witness statement was changed is yours, and you have not substantiated it at all, so I ignored it. Your unsourced quote included this time is also meaningless to me, because I have no idea who is making the assertions. I can't even tell what it is that they don't know. Further more, the fact that the first prosecutor saw no crime doesn't even prove that anything was changed. She could have read the exact same thing and not found it worth prosecuting. ""We don't know"".

It's not mine, it's from the article I linked in my first reply, the one with Nils Melzer, as is the quotation. Did you even read the article?  
This is an [image](https://cdn.repub.ch/s3/republik-assets/github/republik/article-nils-melzer/images/ae7c94c0202d2e237296d811e97f684822e69dc5.jpeg) of Swedish police talking about it from that same article. Could you please summarise it for me, since it's too faint for Google Translate?  

&gt;They have both continued to cooperate with the investigation. I'm not sure what kind of corroboration you're looking for, but their continued involvement should not be impossible to find evidence for if you want to.

At least something that says they stood by the accusations post-2010. It's quite hard to find, since all that's known about them are their initials, and they're barely mentioned, if at all, in articles.  

&gt;Not in his tweet, which was pretty clear, and the first quote of yours is about the findings of the UN workgroup, not a representation of Nils Melzer's opinions. The group did find it to be arbitrary detention though: https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=17013&amp;LangID=E

If this is what you meant: ""- end 10yrs of persecution, abuse &amp; arbitrary detention"", then you misunderstood. There is no indication that arbitrary detention is aimed at his stay in the embassy. If anything, considering that the article in the link at the bottom of the tweet specifically links it to his stay in solitary confinement in prison, I'd say you're wrong.  
From the Twitter linked article:  
""The progressively severe suffering inflicted on Mr. Assange, **as a result of his prolonged solitary confinement, amounts not only to arbitrary detention**, but also to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, **Melzer said**.""

&gt;Repeatedly saying that it's a dumpster fire doesn't make it one, and it was off for a few hours eleven ten years ago.

This is the first time I've called it a dumpster fire though?  
That was the first time, then it was almost dropped in 2013 (link in previous comment), his warrant was revoked in 2017 (effectively closing the case), after his asylum was revoked (April 11th, 2019) it was reopened in May 2019, and then finally closed in November 2019.  

&gt;Yes, because of his actions this far, as we have discussed.  

So, you're saying he's biased because because his investigation results were in favour of Assange? Seriously?

363,"Actually the relationship of Hungarian to the Uralic group isn't completely agreed upon. And its status in the Ugric branch is a guess at best. The closest language I've ever heard to Hungarian is Khanty and even then only the numbers sound somewhat similar.

The apparent relationship of Hungarian to Uralic languages could be a result of the influences they picked when the tribes used to be nomadic. There's a theory that the tribal groups originated from somewhere around the Mongolian Steppes (specifically to the north, east of Serbia). And some early descriptions of Hungarians/Magyars by Europeans describe north Asian people. 

In fact, in the 10th century a common saying was ""A sagittis Hungarorum, libera nos Domine""¬†(Lord, save us from the arrows of the Hungarians). The Hungarians were known for their ability to shoot with deadly accuracy from horseback, very much like the Mongolians were known for.

The Turkic languages are not part of the Uralic family. It is literally one of the primary language groups in the world, with everything before being called proto-Turkic (once you get into the proto-languages it's mostly guess work). You might be thinking of the Ural-Altaic proposed convergence of the two Uralic and ""Altaic"" language families. But this is now considered an obsolete theory.

Records of written Hungarian go back as far as the 11th century, however the earliest mention of Albanian was an eye witness account from the 13th century.

Even in the theory that puts Hungarian in the Ugric group theorizes that Hungarian split from the other languages of that group at some point in the first millennium BC. But as cultures do, they mix, swap, exchange, borrow, and steal from each other. There's plenty of evidence to show the Turkish, Slavic languages, and others have influenced Hungarian and have been influenced themselves.",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/kl68ll/tolkien_quote_about_the_finnish_language/gh9f7pu/,cbstryker,1609131644

Cameron had to promise that we would not transfer any more powers/sovereignty to the EU without a referendum and there's no way the UK would vote to give more powers away.

When it came to the new EU treaty in 2011, he basically had no choice but to veto it, he was trapped. The fact that the other countries then just made their treaty anyway outside the EU highlighted that having the veto was meaningless and the UK had very little power over its destiny in the EU.

405,"&gt;then at least don't treat your own citizens like worthless slaves

Sir this is a Wendy's.

&gt;I just think that if instead of our leaders pretending some countries have to be our enemies or inferior instead treating everyone like potential allies could be way better.

The problem with this line of thinking is that usually the people who think like this are special or have transcended normal human interaction when it comes to this but you aren't. It's just that reality is reality and we have to face reality with logic not a fairy tale.

&gt;Intervening in a country because your country doesn't align with their views isn't fair. That's my biggest problem with how our leaders act. Like couping democratically elected socialists in South America.

This is funny coming from an Austrian and knowing a little bit about the horrors of what the Austrian government has done. We don't even have to go back that far though because your country willingly joined Nazi Germany and fought for them. 

My biggest problem is that people like you who come from countries that are irrelvant on the world stage to effect anybody else because of how weak their country is have to pander and talk down on others who live in countries that actually decide what goes on. Sure it's easy to sit there in your irrelevant country and do nothing because you can only do nothing but serve a stronger country and your country doesn't have to get their hands dirty because they are served a platinum plate of protection and wealth.

Soon a man in a rowboat came by and shouted to the man in the water, ""Jump in, I can save you.""

The stranded man shouted back, ""No, it's OK, I'm praying to God and he is going to save me.""

So the rowboat went on.

Then a motorboat came by. ""The man in the motorboat shouted, ""Jump in, I can save you.""

To this the stranded man said, ""No thanks, I'm praying to God and he is going to save me. I have faith.""

So the motorboat went on.

Then a helicopter came by and the pilot shouted down, ""Grab this rope and I will lift you to safety.""

To this the stranded man again replied, ""No thanks, I'm praying to God and he is going to save me. I have faith.""

So the helicopter reluctantly flew away.

Eventually the man got too tired to stay afloat and drowned. He arrived at the gates of Heaven and got a chance to discuss this whole situation with God, at which point he exclaimed, ""I had faith in you but you didn't save me, you let me drown. I don't understand why!""

482,"Ooh if you want suggestions, [imo this is the best free online Korean grammar resource](https://www.howtostudykorean.com/), they explain so clearly and they're a foreigner but they seem to have super strong Korean skills. 

I hate Duolingo üòÖ

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure what stage you're at, but some tips are: 

Learn the alphabet first, otherwise the dipthongs will seem illogical. If you can read, Ïúº + Ïù¥ = Ïùò makes perfect sense.

Make sure your pronunciation is correct from the beginning! I was walking around Seoul in The Before Times (last year) with an American who was learning Korean, and she was complaining that she'll try speaking it and always get replies in English. I didn't have the heart to tell her her Korean is unintelligible...

Use resources that teach according to Korean grammar, rather than trying to manhandle Korean to fit English/ your language's grammar. For example, a major red flag is if a resource teaches Í∑∏ÎÖÄ to mean she/her, because European languages have this. Korean doesn't have gendered pronouns and actually, because it's so strange, Í∑∏ÎÖÄ  comes across as an insult like ""that bitch"".

Love it or hate it, catchy songs are a good way to memorise vocab, and the Kpop fans upload lyrics videos for everything.

If you're picking up more &amp; more vocab, it helps to be able to recognise which words come from Chinese. With the Chinese-origin words (\~2/3 of the words, especially the more sophisticated/ formal meanings, similar to Latin vs Germanic words in English), each syllable will refer to a hanja (character) with a specific meaning. I can guess many words I haven't heard before, because I've heard this syllable in these meanings and that syllable in these meanings... working it out is easier than rote memorisation.

The article I posted above, should actually concern all people.

The problem amounts more to taking it a step further into the literal of the end times prophecy.

In any case, religious thought is not always anti-science. Its often a philosophical construct that can live parallel to scientific reasoning. Other times of course it comes in direct conflict. 

But I also see the other side of the coin in what you call 'sciencers'. Science is never about a single indisputable theory. Authors, scientists, people who write journals never agree on everything, and as such is why over 50 000 medical professionals signed the great Barrington declaration. All criticism of vaccines, that were in fact accelerated through operation warp speed for approval is also not without merit. 

No one party gets to claim 'science'. And I find that some people, a feel I get from you too, represent their science as some sort of 'faith' - mandate or uncompromising belief system, as if pretending that whatever your governments or news media push is in fact the full scope of 'science'. Don't fall into this trap.

People need to learn to think again. That includes both the religiously indoctrinated of abrahamic religions.

534,"The vaccines are all there to help your body fight covid not to prevent infection (impossible? not a medical expert), there will still be a period of time from when you're infected to it being eliminated, this period of time will be shortened by the vaccine so you won't be as infectious on the whole, and may not notice any symptoms (asymptomatic). But for some people it may not act quite as fast due to a weak immune system etc. So while the vaccine will help them get rid of it and still increase survival rate, they will display symptoms, and a tiny fraction may still die.

The difference in responses is why the vaccines have different apparent levels of effectivity. The Pfizer vaccine trials used symptomatic testing so only the second group were identified (10%), even though some will have been infectious but were asymptomatic and thus not tested. In comparison the Oxford vaccine tested all participants showing 60% efficacy, so for 60% of people the persons immune system with the vaccine was able to fight off the virus before they became infectious (of symptomatic).

As with all capitals, there is a higher concentration of wankers than elsewhere, the traffic has become a complete mess and the city center is becoming gentrified and ridiculously touristy. 

Then there is the winter where you might not see the sun for weeks, because the city is at the bottom of a basin and it's constantly overcast. On the other hand, in the summer you'd be better to avoid any green areas because the mosquitoes get a bit hungry. Pick your season.

Apart from that it's cool, cosy, youthful, and the bike infrastructure is genuinely great. Violent crime is close to non-existent and there are no dangerous areas to walk at night.

567,"&gt; Thanks for your reply. Your first point - wouldn‚Äôt that be similar to trade between Ireland and NI?

Yes. There is less trade between NI and the Republic than there is between NI and GB. Currency is part of the reason.

&gt;Similarly, is there trade friction between the U.K. and continental Europe because of the ¬£/‚Ç¨?

Yes. Economists seem to believe that different currencies cause friction because of exchange rate uncertainties etc.

&gt;Your second point - could the new Scottish currency peg itself to the euro rather than the pound?

Scotland could try to peg its currency to any other (eg the Euro or the dollar). However, I don't think a Scottish currency could be pegged at the existing rate because Scotland's large deficit would inevitably cause it to devalue. Fundamentally, Scotland lives beyond its means thanks to the fiscal transfer from the UK, and ending that would reduce the value of a Scottish currency.

The UK tried to peg the pound to the Deutsche Mark in the early 90s, the policy failed spectacularly when the Bundesbank made it clear it thought the pound was over valued. All the currency reserves accumulated by the UK government were inadequate to defend the value of the pound, the government lost billions of pounds in a single day trying to defend it, and had to admit defeat. It destroyed John Major's government in the early 90s. And all that happened in 1 day after the Bundesbank president gave an interview to a journalist in which he said he thought the pound was overvalued:

&gt;Apologies for my economics naivety, it‚Äôs not an area I profess any expertise in.

Nope. I'm not a dogmatic thinker. I think the scientific process/system is good, but science is performed by humans, and humans are flawed by nature. They can be biased, corrupt, or make errors, even if their intentions are good (which they also are not, always).

Again, I wasn't only talking about mosques. Ottomans build other buildings as well. Some were destroyed, others survived.. just like with architecture from all the civilizations that existed before them.
Also it's not identical but Nazis were invaders and occupiers to the Poles... just like Ottomans were to Greeks.

&gt;To destroy them was an act of hate toward local Muslims and was part of a ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù on regular ass people who used it to pray, terrifying them into fleeing.

Not sure why you're only concentrating on mosques. After the Greek revolution there were acts of hatred towards muslims just like there were acts of hatred towards christians. The population exchange solved that problem. Sadly it was a bad solution because lots of people had to leave their homes just because of their religion.. from both sides of the Aegean sea. Ideally people from both religions should live side by side but that wasn't the case.

Revenge isn't acceptable but you can certainly understand why people might want to express their anger to an occupier that oppressed them for 400 years.

Indeed, France has changed its legislation in 2016 to protect its own whistleblowers, but being a whistleblower is not part of the criteria for refugee status. Edward Snowden will therefore not be able to claim it if he decides to apply to the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (Ofpra), the only body that can grant refugee status.

Christine Lagarde: A lawyer that has been ruled guilty over the misappropriation of 400 Mio ‚Ç¨ in public funding and never has lead a national bank is supposed to lead the European Central Bank? Charles Michel: A Belgian that couldn‚Äôt even build a functional government in Belgium is suppose to become congress president and create balance in a more and more complex network of national interests? And then you, Mrs. Von Der Leyen: a German minister without any experience in European politics that only stood out for her disposition towards overly expensive consultants, mismanagement and euphemisms. ‚ÄûTrendwende Finanzen‚Äú (something like trend turn in finance?) for the biggest armament campaign since the end of the war.

I don't know what any of this means and neither do you. 

Roman Polanski made a plea deal with prosecutors that he would plead guilty and be sentenced to time served. The thing is, judges do not have to accept plea bargains. That's just something you make with prosecutors, typically Judges do. It's very odd that they wouldn't, as all parties involved usually run it by a judge before go through with it. 

In this case, letting someone who plied a child with quaaludes and then anally raped her get away with only 42 days is wrong. The judge would be right to not accept it. ...but we don‚Äôt know. He claimed he was going to accept it, Polanski‚Äôs lawyers said he signaled he was going to reject it.

1010,"It is a good strategy but not the only possible one.

While it does make sense to vaccinate them first, it also makes sense to vaccinate others first. Why?

While you want to protect the elderly, even with a vaccine you don't want covid to get into those elderly homes as they still can get ill. At 96 years old even a minor illnes can be fatal.

So some might argue that it would make more sense to vaccinate the people who work there and the visitors, as those are the one that will ultimately infect the elderly.

Who are the one that can easely spread it? Medical staff -&gt; workingclass, children and students -&gt; (all the way down the bottom) elderly people in and elderly home. If you want to stop the spread, you'd make sure vaccinate the ones who spread the virus. If they are vaccinated, they are less likely to spread it.

Arguments could be made as for how useful it really is to vaccinate a 96 year old first. Will she be able to spread it? Will it make her life-expectancy any higher? At that age the chances that you'll make it another year are slim.

1250,"&gt; Giving secret information to your countries enemies

Just because US authorities labeled some constitution violating actions as ""secret"" that doesn't mean it somehow makes them unable to be exposed.

&gt;Revealing methods of how the NSA tracks terrorists is not a good outcome

This is US propaganda, there's zero evinced anything Snowden revealed had anti impact on anti-terrorist surveillance. Did you think terrorists didn't know about surveillance pre Snowden ? Hilarious. They started using burners in the 90's for a reason.

From an article by Bailey Cahall :

*our review of the government‚Äôs claims about the role that NSA ‚Äúbulk‚Äù surveillance of phone and email communications records has had in keeping the United States safe from terrorism shows that these claims are overblown and even misleading. An in-depth analysis of 225 individuals recruited by al-Qaeda or a like-minded group or inspired by al-Qaeda‚Äôs ideology, and charged in the United States with an act of terrorism since 9/11, demonstrates that traditional investigative methods, such as the use of informants, tips from local communities, and targeted intelligence operations, provided the initial impetus for investigations in the majority of cases, while the contribution of NSA‚Äôs bulk surveillance programs to these cases was minimal. Indeed, the controversial bulk collection of American telephone metadata, which includes the telephone numbers that originate and receive calls, as well as the time and date of those calls but not their content, under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, appears to have played an identifiable role in initiating, at most, 1.8 percent of these cases. NSA programs involving the surveillance of non-U.S. persons outside of the United States under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act played a role in 4.4 percent of the terrorism cases we examined, and NSA surveillance under an unidentified authority played a role in 1.3 percent of the cases we examined.*",,/r/europe/comments/kkz281/edward_snowden_and_his_wife_lindsey_mills_had/gh61tfe/,Enartloc,1609064375

1263,"Saying ""oh it was just under mussolini"" doesn't make it better in the slightest, you realise that, right?

Furthermore you're making the ""appeasements"" out to be way different than they actually were. It wasn't until the late 70s until a satisfactory state had been reached. Before that it was a very slow process where small progress was made every other year. What you did was throwing bread crumbs towards a starving man. The South Tyrolean population voted multiple times in favour of leaving Italy and, against the human right of self-determination, it was denied every time. 
I'm not about to defend them for the lives that they took by the way, that should never have happened and the fight should've definitely been a peaceful one, but if it wasn't for the freedom fighters South Tyrol wouldn't be nearly as autonomous as it is now.

Also, lets not kid ourselves, the Italian government still sees the South Tyrolean autonomy as something undesirable. Just take a look at the south tyrolean hospitals for example, there's loads of doctors that don't speak a lick of german (in a german speaking region by the way) and the italian government does fuck all about it, yet in the opposite case it's completely unthinkable that a doctor doesn't speak italian and a lawsuit gets filed.

1474,"It is 4pm on Thursday, and only a matter of hours since Boris Johnson struck the agreement that finally sealed Britain‚Äôs divorce from the European Union after 47 years of membership.

But as he sits down and begins to reflect on the tumult of the past few weeks in an exclusive interview with The Telegraph, it is clear the Prime Minister is fully aware of the historical significance of the moment.

‚ÄúI think it has been a long intellectual odyssey for many people of this country,‚Äù he said, casting back to 1988, shortly before he, an up-and-coming journalist at The Telegraph, was dispatched to Brussels to report on the European Commission.

‚ÄúThe whole country has been divided about this issue, because we are European, but on the other hand we don‚Äôt necessarily want to feel that we‚Äôre committed to the ideology of the European Union.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs been the problem and I think it is absolutely true that Margaret Thatcher ... she did begin this period of questioning. Her Bruges speech was very, very important.‚Äù

Mr Johnson is referring to a speech that, to many Eurosceptics, formed the foundations of the bitter and protracted political struggle against ever closer union that ultimately set Britain on the path to Brexit.

At the height of her power and railing against Jacques Delors‚Äô latest move towards deeper integration, in 1988 Baroness Thatcher urged the Commission to abandon aspirations of a ‚ÄúEuropean super-state‚Äù which would infringe on the ‚Äúdifferent traditions, parliamentary powers and sense of national pride in one's own country"".

Her warning went unheeded, however, and just four years later the UK signed up to the Maastricht Treaty and with it the creation of the European Union as it is constituted today.

And yet, even after she was toppled and replaced by John Major, an ardent Europhile, the seeds of discontent and the desire to reclaim British sovereignty had been sown in Bruges.

‚ÄúWhen you read it now ... it‚Äôs prophetic,‚Äù Mr Johnson said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no question I think she would have voted ‚Ä¶‚Äù, at which point he stops abruptly.

He is, however, reluctant to draw a historical comparison when asked how significant the trade deal ‚Äì which he has spent the past 11 months negotiating ‚Äì is for Britain‚Äôs future, but said he hopes it marks ‚Äúan important turning point in our country‚Äôs relations with Europe"".

‚ÄúIt's the end of a long and fractious period, in which we kept trying to pretend to ourselves that we could go along with all sorts of things we didn‚Äôt really want to do for the sake of keeping up with the great project of European Union,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄúI think this gives us a basis for a new friendship and partnership that should attract people who love Europe and want to have a great relationship with it, who want to feel close to it.

‚ÄúBut it should also be something that is welcome to people who see the advantages of economic and political independence. I think the country as a whole has got itself into a new and more stable footing. It‚Äôs a better relationship and a healthier relationship.‚Äù

While Mr Johnson has one eye on the past, he makes clear that the other is firmly trained on the future.

The deal he has brokered is a tale of compromise on both sides, but the Prime Minister believes he has secured a number of key concessions that will enable Britain to be truly independent, deliver on Vote Leave‚Äôs pledges, and allow the Government to fully deliver on his ‚Äúlevelling up‚Äù agenda.

From the outset, Brussels had pushed for the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to oversee the continuation of EU subsidy law in Britain, but Mr Johnson said ‚Äúthere is no role for the ECJ, no EU law.‚Äù

The deal also covers services ‚Äì accounting for 80 per cent of British exports ‚Äì although on financial services Mr Johnson acknowledges that the treaty ‚Äúperhaps does not go as far as we would like"".

He adds there is ‚Äúaccess for solicitors, barristers‚Äù and a ‚Äúgood deal for digital‚Äù, with agreements covering the flow of data.

Other chapters include energy, continued access to non-EU car parts, and rules covering electric cars, protecting Japanese car manufacturers in Britain and the wider industry.

The tariff and quota-free deal covers ¬£660bn worth of trade a year, which Mr Johnson said will still be ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù but with new customs procedures and paperwork which will mean things are ‚Äúdifferent and there will be things that business have to do"".

In particular, he is keen to stress that the UK will be free to diverge from EU standards.

This is particularly gratifying for Mr Johnson, who said that after being accused of ‚Äúcakeism for so many years,‚Äù he has achieved what his critics said was impossible: ‚ÄúThat you could do free trade with the EU without being drawn into their regulatory or legislative orbit.‚Äù

Brussels had started off demanding dynamic alignment ‚Äì the UK and EU moving in lockstep on standards in future ‚Äì and in recent weeks risked torpedoing the agreement by demanding the right to impose automatic ‚Äúlightning‚Äù tariffs if Britain‚Äôs standards did not evolve with its own over time.

But this has been ‚Äúgreatly watered down‚Äù, Mr Johnson said, after being ‚Äúbasically neutered‚Äù by the ‚Äúbrilliance‚Äù of one of his leading trade negotiators, Oliver Lewis.

The UK has signed up to non-regression ‚Äì maintaining current standards in some areas ‚Äì which is a bone of contention for some Brexiteers, who are keen to embark on a bonfire of Brussels‚Äô red tape.

However, the Prime Minister suggested this is a misreading of his Government‚Äôs agenda. ‚ÄúAll that‚Äôs really saying is the UK won‚Äôt immediately send children up chimneys or pour raw sewage all over its beaches. We‚Äôre not going to regress, and you‚Äôd expect that.‚Äù

The compromise reached is that both sides will now be able to seek redress through an independent arbitrator, such as the imposition of tariffs, should they feel the level playing field for their businesses has been undermined by the other refusing to raise its standards.

‚ÄúI would stress that this one is reciprocal,‚Äù Mr Johnson said, citing animal welfare standards and more stringent farming practices as one area where Brussels could fall foul of the UK‚Äôs higher standards.

But he suggested it would be very unlikely the UK would slap tariffs on the EU in this area.

‚ÄúWe could do it ... but we‚Äôd be unlikely to do it because we don‚Äôt really believe in tariffs; we believe in high standards. If the EU did something like that, it would have to be proportionate and approved by the arbitrator.‚Äù

He added that the treaty is ‚Äúexplicit that if this sort of thing starts happening regularly ... then the whole free trade aspect collapses‚Äù and the UK would simply revert to World Trade Organisation terms.

Now free to diverge, Mr Johnson signaled that major changes are coming down the track.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one thing to gain your freedom, but we can‚Äôt be like Charlie Chaplin in Modern Times,‚Äù he added, referring to the 1936 film in which Chaplin, reprising his iconic character Little Tramp, is released from jail, only to then seek reimprisonment after struggling to cope with life on the outside.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt sort of suddenly decide that we‚Äôre free and then not decide how to exercise it. This Government has a very clear agenda to unite and level up and to spread opportunity across the country.‚Äù

In January, the Treasury will start the process by formally abolishing the tampon tax, made possible by Britain‚Äôs exit from the EU, with plans to establish low-tax free ports also well underway.

However, Mr Johnson suggests this is just the tip of the iceberg, and that many of the changes he has been planning have been kept under wraps for fear of jeopardising the trade talks.

‚ÄúA great Government effort has gone into compiling these and we haven‚Äôt necessarily wanted to talk about them much during this period because that perhaps would not have been fruitful,‚Äù he continues.

‚ÄúWhat I say to my colleagues is free ports, yes, free trade deals, fantastic, changing animal welfare regulations, great, new stuff on data or chemicals, let‚Äôs have a look at it all.

‚ÄúWe want to see what we can take forward. We don‚Äôt want to diverge for the sake of diverging. But we‚Äôre going to want to do things differently where that‚Äôs useful for the British people.‚Äù

Another area is business taxes and regulation, with Mr Johnson stating that Rishi Sunak is ‚Äúdoing a big exercise on all of this‚Äù, although he adds he wants to give the Chancellor space to work through proposals.

And what of the economy. Does he believe that Brexit will shave five per cent from GDP growth, as modelling has suggested, or will an independent trade policy and regulatory freedom defy the expectations of those who say Britain has voted to become poorer?

‚ÄúFreedom is what you make of it,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to us now to seize the opportunities. We are going to do our best and I think it does present considerable advantages, but we have a very big challenge now with Covid-19."" Before that, Mr Johnson must first make it through to New Year‚Äôs Eve.

Over the next two days, 1,246 pages of the treaty will be poured over by the European Research Group of Tory MPs, who will on Monday deliver a public verdict to the nation on whether it meets the so-called ‚Äúsovereignty test‚Äù.",,/r/europe/comments/kkzduw/boris_johnson_interview_from_bruges_to_brexit/gh5k3y0/,casualphilosopher1,1609053278

1476,"Legislation implementing the treaty in domestic law will then be rammed through Parliament at breakneck speed on Wednesday, leaving just 24 hours to spare before the transition period ends and the UK‚Äôs future relationship with the EU begins.

And while there is no prospect this time round of the legislation being defeated (Sir Keir Starmer‚Äôs backing has made sure of that) Mr Johnson is determined to convince even the most hardline Brexiteer that his deal delivers on the promises made by the Vote Leave in 2016.

‚ÄúI think it will survive the toughest, most ruthless scrutiny by the scholiasts of the Star Chamber,‚Äù he said, half-jokingly, referring to the ERG‚Äôs panel of lawyers, whose conclusions will be taken as gospel by many Brexiteers. He adds that the deal delivers on the ‚Äúfundamental things‚Äù the public voted for, including taking back control of the UK‚Äôs money, borders and laws.

The Prime Minister will have a harder time convincing British fishermen that he has won on fish, although his choice of attire (a fish-patterned tie and a herringbone shirt) certainly suggests he will make a go of it.

The deal requires the EU to repatriate only 25 per cent of the value of fish it currently catches over a five and a half-year transition period.

This is down from the UK‚Äôs original demand of 80 per cent over three years, but still considerably better than the offer of 18 per cent over 10 years that Brussels was initially prepared to concede.

And Mr Johnson makes clear that after the transition ends there will be annual negotiations, meaning the UK‚Äôs quotas could go up.

‚ÄúOur fishing waters is something that is only a small fraction of the UK economy but is very symbolically important ... we‚Äôve done that as well,‚Äù he said. Some cynics have suggested that a deal, struck at the last-minute, was always the inevitable outcome, and that a no-deal scenario was merely an empty threat intended only to keep Brexiteers in the Conservaitve Party on side. But Mr Johnson is keen to impress that this is false, and that he and Lord Frost, his chief Brexit negotiator ‚Äúcame to the conclusion several times that things were going in the wrong direction and that our best bet was to go for no deal.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe made that clear to the EU. I really would have done it, believe me.‚Äù

One of those moments came last month when Michel Barnier, the EU‚Äôs chief negotiator, brought forward fresh proposals on the level playing field which Mr Johnson said ‚Äúmuch more closely resembled dynamic alignment"".

The second he describes as the ‚Äúhammer‚Äù, a term used by Brussels to refer to its demand that it be allowed to retaliate in other areas of trade if there was a row over the fisheries agreement.

This, Mr Johnson said, would have allowed the EU ‚Äúimpose tariffs on any type of British goods‚Äù if the UK attempted to cut its fish quotas in future.

‚ÄúIt meant that we could walk out of jail but the hammer would come down, bang! like Maxwell‚Äôs Silver Hammer,‚Äù he added, referring to the Beatles song in which a student embarks on a killing spree using the tool.

‚ÄúThat was plainly a restriction on our freedom, that was not taking back control of our waters, that meant that if we actually tried to take back control of our waters we got hit. I think those were the most difficult things.‚Äù

The reason why Brussels caved, Mr Johnson said, is because the UK could act with ‚Äúabsolute conviction‚Äù and ‚Äúget up and walk away‚Äù knowing that it had prepared adequately for no deal.

This he puts down to the ‚Äúvery important‚Äù work of Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of domestic Brexit preparedness, who also co-chaired the EU-UK joint committee responsible for resolving issues with trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

‚ÄúThat was helped on by the UK Internal Market Bill,‚Äù Mr Johnson added, citing the legislation laid earlier this year, which threatened to tear up parts of Theresa May‚Äôs Withdrawal Agreement in order to protect ties with the province in the event of no deal.

With the signing of the trade deal bringing to an end four and half years of political turmoil in Britain, Mr Johnson‚Äôs full focus and energy will quickly shift back to confronting the far greater challenge posed by the coronavirus pandemic.

But as the country prepares to usher in the new year (and with it a new relationship with Europe) he suggested that those who have spent decades pushing for Brexit should be given the opportunity to savour the moment.

‚ÄúI hope people will be deeply reassured that they have now ... a resolution of an issue that has bedevilled our politics for decades. And, I believe, it is the basis for a lasting new friendship and partnership.‚Äù",,/r/europe/comments/kkzduw/boris_johnson_interview_from_bruges_to_brexit/gh5k4cf/,casualphilosopher1,1609053283

Well we don't call it telomeres and they are definitely not the same thing, but indeed,  they definitely bear some striking similarities) are the end parts of  nucleic acid (in a technical term the 3' end). The 3' end of a nucleic acid will naturally hydrolyze (~degrade) and thus the tail will shorten with time. The length of this tail depends on complicated regulatory mechanism and will influenve the lifetime of their nucleic acid as some kind of timer mechanism (or perhaps a bit like a fuse to a bomb slowly burning up, idk).

Now the outcome of what a telomere does is quite a bit more drastic: it determines the lifetime of the chromosome and with that the entire cell. Sometimes this malfunctions in some rogue cells, which is a factor in cancer. The poly-A tail only determines the life of a transcript (a kind of protein blueprint, from mRNA), and with that how many proteins can be constructed from one single blueprint, thus forming an additional to regulate the levels of certain proteins. However, this kind of regulation isn't awfully common or well-known to my knowledge (there are other steps from DNA to protein where you can interrupt or interfere with the process).",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/kkixb0/reverse_engineering_the_source_code_of_the/gh4pswt/,hydrocharis,1609037567

1690,"The problem here is that the Bill of Rights in the US rests upon a system that simply works differently than the British system of government presently does, and those differences are what makes those rights meaningful.  It's not immediately obvious to me how to adapt it absent fundamental changes ‚Äî the British system is pretty unusual among modern countries.

In the US, the US Constitution is the source of legal authority.  If a law contradicts the  Constitution, then the law is void.  One can challenge laws in court and ultimately have them overturned ‚Äî this is what happens if the government passes a law that violates rights guaranteed by the Constitution.  The Constitution grants a supermajority of three-quarters of US states the power to change it.

In the UK, sovereignty is vested in the [Queen-in-Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen-in-Parliament), which for practical purposes in the present day is a majority in Parliament.  In the British system of government, one has [parliamentary sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_sovereignty) ‚Äî a majority in Parliament (which today amounts to a majority in the House of Commons, since the House of Lords has been stripped of most of its powers) ‚Äî can do anything legally.  It is the highest authority in the system of government.  Nothing can overrule it because there is no greater authority.

A Briton cannot challenge primary legislation (stuff from Parliament) that Parliament has written into law.  He can only challenge secondary legislation (stuff from the executive, the PM/civil service).

&gt;The doctrine of parliamentary supremacy may be summarized in three points: 
&gt;
&gt;* Parliament can make laws concerning anything.
&gt;
&gt;* No Parliament can bind a future parliament (that is, it cannot pass a law that cannot be changed or reversed by a future Parliament).
&gt;
&gt;* A valid Act of Parliament cannot be questioned by the court. Parliament is the supreme lawmaker.

So you can't have a bill of rights that constrains Parliament in any meaningful sense in the present British system, because if a majority in the House of Commons wants to pass a law, they can as easily alter any law that would obstruct them from doing so.  A majority in Parliament has written acts that have invalidated pieces of the Magna Carts, for example.  A British court has no authority to order a law that Parliament has passed be invalidated.

So any such rights, to be meaningful, would involve a far-more-fundamental change to the system of government than just passing a hypothetical Bill of Rights Act 2021.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/kkgb48/george_blake_a_famous_mole_in_british/gh4r89k/,duisThias,1609038438

&amp;#x200B;

As we established before , Poland had no plans of annexation of Lithuania. No historian support your claim. And Poland abandoned the idea of a union with Lithuania when they saw that it was not mutal.

&gt; It's HILARIOUS that you're comparing the Russian empire outright banning  the Lithuanian language, books and education to people putting up  illegal street signs on their private houses. Did you know that the  Polish minority was in the Vilnius and national Lithuanian government  ruling coalitions for more than 10 years out of the last 30? Muh  oppressed Poles who somehow end up being the government of Lithuania. 

Im not suprised as proper Lithuanians only accounted for 1-2 % of Vilnus before ethnic cleansing and Lithuanization in the last century. Banning bi-lingual street signs and defending it  just show your inferiorty complex.

The difference in  that Lithuania is breaking miniority rights in 21th century and you are diggins up things from 100-200 years ago just shows your dillusion and hypocrisy

1750,"&gt;So you reckon what Poland and Hungary did by vetoing everything is ok?

I didn't agree with it, but it is in line with the rules and at the end of the day, countries sign up to the EU with an expectation of those rules applying, that is the amount of power they hand off. The EU (or a majority of members..) don't and indeed shouldn't have the power to shift that. That would be far, far more dangerous than what we are seeing from Poland and Hungary.

&gt;If the majority wants to move that direction and there's a single country that vetos it, the whole EU has to stay in its existing direction?

Because the EU is a union of sovereign states that can only move in any given direction when there is consent from all states. The UK showed the issues with that repeatedly (first by gaining opt-outs to the elements it disagreed with, then by leaving when it seemed clear that it couldn't reverse some of the things it had agreed to, but found it was beholden to popular political pressure). The EU can't force members to act in a given way if they haven't already agreed in principle to allowing the EU to do so.

&gt;So If France decides to veto the deal against UK even though the rest of the EU wants wouldn't that be called hijacking the outcome?

It wouldn't be hijacking the outcome no, and it would come with political costs within the EU for France, but it would be the EU working as intended..

&gt;Indeed its countries acting in it existing parameters, this doesn't have to anything with more or less integration. Its a fundamental problem with the EU, that a single country can veto something that could be beneficial to the whole of EU just because it has some sort of stake in it.

Again, that is what the EU is and yes, it's a problem for the EU if you want it to be able to make use of its size and meet its potential as a regional power, but the EU is the member states, they are not subordinate to it or any individual, or collection of member states. In that context, any country can veto anything that isn't an exclusive EU competency, or where it is subject to a QMV procedure. 

If you want to change that, you need treaty change, which obviously requires consent in and of itself.",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/kkmd6k/greece_is_not_dragging_the_eu_into_anything_it_is/gh4ao7s/,-ah,1609028450

Measures that were relaxed for Christmas day in Wales have also been re-imposed.

The  number of people under the country‚Äôs top level of restrictions ‚Äî Tier 4  ‚Äî increased by 6 million on Saturday to 24 million people, around 43%  of Britain‚Äôs population. No indoor mixing of households is allowed and  only essential travel permitted. Gyms, pools, hairdressers and stores selling nonessential goods have been ordered to close.

A  further 570 deaths from COVID-19 were reported in the last 24 hours,  bringing the total death toll to 70.195. More than 32,700 new cases of  the disease were reported on Christmas day.

In  her annual Christmas address, Queen Elizabeth II, who has spent much of the year isolating at Windsor Castle with her husband Prince Philip,  delivered a heartfelt message of hope praising the ‚Äúindomitable spirit‚Äù  of those who have risen ‚Äúmagnificently‚Äù to the challenges of the pandemic.",,/r/europe/comments/kkkzyr/uk_imposes_tough_new_restrictions_to_fight_virus/gh2wxeg/,vorkesur,1608999445

""Stalkers that venture above must always abide the following rules.

5) never go inside of the building that has a clear sign of inhabitants

4) always carry enough food and water for two days at least

3) if possible always stay ten meters from each other.

2348,"Umm 1980 was not when the first protests happened, are you crazy? Read up on Kosovo during Rankovic‚Äôs era. It was so barbaric even Tito had to publicly apologize to Albanians.

No I am not ignoring attrocities commited by thr Albanian side. I hope every single Albanian and Serb who committed crimes against civilians rots in prison.

With that said, the statistics are undeniable. The final death count was like 8:1 ratio for Albanians, meaning 8x more Albanians died during the war.

I will never advocate burning churches, but it‚Äôs very important to note that it came as retaliation for the hundreds of mosques that Serbs burned throughout the war, not because Albanians just hate churches. There are Catholic and Orthodox Albanians too, and nobody has anything against them.

The yellow house is very interesting because it could never be confirmed. To be honest, I read up on it and do believe that attrocities happened there, but it‚Äôs hard to do something about it when we dont have the evidence to back it up.

Suva Reka massacre is just one of the many massacres Serbs committed in Kosovo. I linked it because it was my family that got massacred.

Point being, war is never good for either side. But the reality of the matter is, Serbs were the oppressors and the aggressors, not Albanians. Albanians had to form the KLA because they were being imprisoned, expelled, beaten up en masse in the 90s. It was impossible to live in Kosovo during that time, so the majority of people were forced to leave and find work somewhere else just to survive.

2394,"&gt; What do you mean with ideologue? Do you want me to name specific Turkish nationalists?  

IDEOLOGUES. Like people who developed the idea, you know? Lemme recount some for you. Yusuf Ak√ßura. Wrote the manifesto of Turkish nationalism (Three types of politics). Volgan Tatar. Ismail Gaspirali, Crimean Tatar, prominent Pan-Turkist. Sadri Maksudi Arsal, Volgan Tatar (wrote the influential ""the Sociological base for Nationalist sentiments""), Namƒ±k Kemal, Ziya G√∂kalp, Nihal Atsƒ±z, Nejdet San√ßar, Alparslan T√ºrke≈ü, Seyit Ahmet Arvasi...

The list goes on. But you name me some politicians who did not invent ideology, nor contributed to it. Specifically people like Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan have already maintained that they were not ""nationalistic"" in sentiment already in previous statements. 

&gt;  In Turkey, only extreme nationalism (Devlet Bahceli) is called nationalism. 
 
It certainly is not, but doesn't matter. The individual approach of political parties regarding nationalism is unimportant, because the Turkish state has ben founded on Turkish nationalism. This means that no party can actively argue for a regime change towards either theocracy, communism, or ethnic separatism.

&gt; if outsiders would go to China they could point out certain Chinese cultural elements
 
They could, but I doubt that the native Chinese would be unaware of it. Aside from that, people are not unaware in Turkey in regards to nationalist sentiment. But not everyone shares it, believe it or not. Nor do most people understand the underlying concepts of nationalism, and what it requires of the individual citizen. If nationalism was, as you said, an internalized concept, the AKP would never have won its first election. Nor the subsequent elections, when the AKP was still good with the Gulenists.

&gt; In the case of what you are saying yes.

I'm eagerly awaiting the historical facts about the grassroots of the early Kurdish uprisings. 

&gt;  Turkish agression against Kurds wasnt and isnt done for neutral purposes but to assimilate &amp; destroy Kurdish culture. 
 
If that is the conclusion you draw from it. I don't even know if there can be a neutral purpose for aggression. In all, we didn't start the uprisings. We just wanted to build roads and schools, and collect taxes and conscripts for the army. You know, stuff that happens in all countries? Given that we had a hard time convincing the rural Turk to send his children to a school, I don't reckon it'd be easier for us to convince the rural Kurd to do so, especially if the child is a girl.",,/r/europe/comments/kjzg3w/erdogans_project_on_turkey/gh29494/,Immediate_Yam_9304,1608977226
2395,"
&gt; The reason why Kurds have to go to Turkish universities is BECAUSE Turks don't allow Kurds to exist outside of Turkish racist supremacy

That makes zero sense, you know that. 

&gt; Turks will go even to Japan to make sure that Kurds aren't learning their own culture and history without interference 

First off, the link that you posted specifically stated that the people attending these classes were JAPANESE, not Kurds. Second, I made some research on my own, and I couldn't find anything relating to Turkish interference in either Turkish or Japanese official sites, nor on the site of the school. Turkish news sites that make these news are usually very careful to not take these things face value, as most of them used the term ""allegation"" rather than ""yeah this happened 100%"".
Aside from that, I'm sure that any student here can to Erbil University, or some other university abroad to learn more about Kurdish culture or whatever. 

&gt;  therefore any Kurdish source is an enemy of Turks and biased.

No, I did my independent research on the issue, and the only source is the man himself. No one else. 

&gt; At least you agree with me that Turkish nationalism is exclusionary. 

I believe it should be exclusionary, unless a particular person really really wants to be of our number. 

&gt; If you build nationalism based on a common struggle, history and culture then you are inclusive. 

That's what the nationalists in Turkey actually did, common struggle, history, culture, religion.
Lemme start off by saying that ""Turkish culture"" in Turkey is in reality, PALACE culture, because the upper echelons of society is where ""culture"" really flourished, as in, Turkish architecture (which is in reality Ottoman architecture, the architecture of common Turks did not go beyond building mud-brick houses or erecting tents if they were nomadic), music (common Turkish folk music consists of a very simple accolade of using a plucked instrument to recite epics, nothing more. Palace music on the other hand is intricate and uses orchestras), dress (which consists of baggy trousers, and assorted headwear), and various related customs changing from region to region. 
What Turkish nationalism did was to bring WESTERN culture into the almost non-nonexistent Turkish culture that was defined by the practices of Anatolian peasants. 
Turkey tried to do the same to the Kurds, they didn't enforce Turkish culture, they enforced WESTERN culture, as in that you basically received the same treatment that the Turks did. You were told that you were going to be given a western style, mixed-gender education, you were to wear western clothing, you were to adopt western manners and attitudes towards certain gender-related issues, and some more.
In that understanding, Turkish nationalism was more than inclusive in its attempt to westernize the country. 
As for common struggle, history, etc, a thousand years is enough to formulate a basis for that, but I'm not judging if you feel that we have nothing in common.

On another note, Kurdish culture, which was a tribal based culture, that lacked the Palace culture of the Ottomans, was on the same extent as Turkish culture, in that is was unrefined, and tribal, mostly Islamic, and held the same attitudes towards the new modes of dress, education and cultural reform.

There is a reason why Kurds in Turkey were able to develop intellectually and economically much further than the Kurds in other parts of the middle east, its because we gave you a chance to acclimate yourself with Western culture, education and dress. This was pretty much the same during the Ottoman Empire, where your feudal lords all sent their sons to Istanbul for education, and they would be transformed into Ottoman gentlemen wearing western style dress and Ottoman fezes, while the reaya would still languish under the backwards customs of the region. 

&gt; they would actively promote Kurdish culture, language &amp; supported Kurds worldwide instead

There was no Kurdish culture to speak of for us to promote, and language was an important barrier that kept the Kurds from integrating into the system. Turkish education was brought to the Kurds after the educational reforms, which was, in essence, western education, but only in Turkish. Its not really that much different from getting the same education in French during the Ottoman era, but instead of the sons of rich feudal lords, common Kurdish peasants were allowed to receive this education, in the national language, which is Turkish.

As for supporting Kurds worldwide, what kind of support are you looking for? 

&gt; because of the racist believe that Kurdish presence is a threat to Turks

Given the magnitude of Kurdish rebellions in our eastern provinces, I really can't think of a reason why Kurdish separatism would be a threat to us, right? 

&gt; but erdogan did this small thing for kurds

I don't care about Erdoƒüan. The best thing that can be done for Kurds is to invest in the South-eastern regions, give them jobs, more advanced infrastructure. These are the only obligations of the Turkish state.

&gt; Brothers in faith isnt an argument, because there are Kurds and Turks who aren't religious. 

Just because you're not religious doesn't mean that you're non-Muslim. In fact, my roommate in university was a very religious Kurd, with whom I started doing the daily prayers, may God bless him.

&gt;  Turks have a police &amp; military to arrest and/or kill every Kurd who says anything about turks.

Wow, so dramatic. Does it matter if its IRL or online? Do you really think that the Turkish police cannot find you through what you say on the internet? Its really easy. So many people have already been arrested for stuff they say online. For now, the Turkish police is hunting for political dissidents who say things about our dear president, rather than looking for some Kurds who insulted the wife or mother of some dead soldier, or call Turks ""barbarian usurpers"" or something. So far, I've only met one Kurd who was really that rude IRL to actually call me an ""invading barbarian"" to my face. I did nothing, although I could have smashed his face in, he a was a short, scrawny guy with a big mouth on a wet arse. Why ruin my day, right.

&gt; Even the PKK has never been a real danger to Turkey.

The PKK is a real danger to order, as their activities are subversive. They do what they can with what they have. What am I gonna say to that?

&gt;  They never had any military capabilities to even occupy 1 city 

Oh they certainly do, and they can, but that would be tantamount to suicide, because they'd be trapped in there. Fighting in separate bands in the mountains or conducting covert-ops in cities is a much more effective mode of resistance.

&gt; But the reason why the PKK is called dangerous is because they are a Kurdish organization that isnt in the claws of Turkey.

And because they kill our soldiers, they kill our civil servants, they explode bombs in Turkish cities, and etc. You mean to tell me that the PKK is not a danger? 

&gt; On the other hand, anti-Kurdish Turks have a police and military to target and kill Kurds. 

You know that the police forces and the army have Kurdish members, right? 

&gt; Kurdish nationalists dont say: Turks cant have an own country, own language, own politics, own friendships, own culture etc.

Neither do we. Its just that you cannot have a country by carving out a piece of Turkey. And believe me if I say, no country in the region wants to cede a part of their land to a Kurdish state. We're entitled to protecting our own territorial integrity. 

&gt; Turkish nationalism on the otehr hand says: we want all of that, and you cant have anything. 

Kurdish nationalists are entitled to their wish to have their own country. But if that country is to be a threat to our own territorial integrity, we have every right to oppose it. Aside from that, if we don't, you still have the Arabs and Iranians to worry about, whom will not aid you in your dreams of a greater Kurdistan.

&gt; Inclusion vs exclusion.

Its more about geopolitical interests, than anything, from what you're saying. Turkey, or Turkish nationalists have no obligation to support an independent Kurdistan. Unless, of course, it is in our interests, which may or may not be so in the future, you cannot know. 
But if we do, know that this Kurdistan will most likely be more like a Turkish client state, than anything. The sad truth is, the Kurds lack the necessary know-how, the human capital and the necessary infrastructure to become independent. Because they cannot realistically keep that country for more than a month before it is blockaded into oblivion, where you won't find toilet paper to wipe your ass with.
So far the Kurds have not played their cards right. They want independence based on an assumption that they somehow ""deserve"" it. No, no one intrinsically deserves independence. Either you take it, or you're granted it. 

&gt; He is talking from an agressive expansionist position.

Well, I guess you're right about that. Erbil is not a Turkmen city.

A construction's real cost is 100K Turkish Lira. This company wants 15 million Turkish Lira as a cost and  goverment gives the tender to this company. Even there are lots of companies they want only 200K or 150K for this construction but no 15 Milion one takes it. After that, Erdogan and this company are splitting by fifty fifty and keep doing more like that. If erdogan loses the next election he probably will escape the country. If you we were able to check his real fortune, he is probably at top 5 richest men of world list.

# Britain is fifth-largest economy in world again after leapfrogging India

by Philip Aldrick, Economics Editor

Britain has retaken fifth place in the rankings of the world‚Äôs biggest economies despite suffering one of the deepest recessions in the pandemic.

According to the annual league table produced by a leading British economics consultancy, the UK has leapfrogged India and will accelerate away from France in the decade after Brexit.

The Centre for Economic and Business Research (CEBR) also forecast China to overtake America as the world‚Äôs biggest economy in 2028, five years earlier than expected after a year in which Asia stole a march on the West by handling the pandemic better.

In comments that chime with government plans to align more closely with Asia, the CEBR said: ‚ÄúOne lesson is that western economies need to keep much more closely in touch with what is happening in Asia to keep up with international developments.‚Äù

Britain had dropped behind India to be the sixth-largest economy last year but a deep pandemic-related recession and a steep fall in the rupee pushed the world‚Äôs second most populous country below the UK in dollar terms.

Britain is expected to have suffered the deepest recession of all G7 leading nations this year and many leading forecasters predict a slow recovery but the CEBR is more optimistic, with annual average growth of 4 per cent until 2025. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government‚Äôs independent forecaster, expects 3.4 per cent average growth. It has estimated that the new UK-EU trade deal will cost 4 per cent in permanently lost GDP.

India will not overtake the UK again until 2024, the CEBR said. India ‚Äúhad been losing momentum even ahead of the shock‚Äù of the coronavirus and was ‚Äúknocked off course‚Äù during the pandemic. Once India regains momentum, it will overtake Germany to be the world‚Äôs fourth-largest economy, behind the US, China and Japan, in 2027.

Britain will cement itself as Europe‚Äôs second-largest economy behind Germany in the coming decade after the [Brexit](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/brexit) deal, holding sixth place in the world league table through to 2035.

France remained the seventh-largest economy this year, two places behind the UK, where it is expected to stay until 2035. ‚ÄúBy 2035, UK GDP in dollars is forecast to be 40 per cent more than that of France, its long-standing rival and neighbour,‚Äù the CEBR said.

The UK is expected to stage a stronger recovery in the next few years and settle into a trend rate of growth of 18 per cent from 2025 onwards. France‚Äôs trend rate of growth is forecast to be 1.7 per cent from 2025.

China is expected to grow 2 per cent this year, while most other leading economies will shrink. ‚ÄúThe skilful management of the pandemic and the hits to long-term growth in the West mean that China‚Äôs relative economic performance has improved. We now think that the Chinese economy in dollar terms will overtake the US economy in 2028, a full five years earlier than we thought last year,‚Äù the CEBR said.

The US accounts for a quarter of global GDP in dollar terms but that is expected to decline from next year as China makes rapid gains.

Covid-19 has knocked $6 trillion off global output this year, compared with pre-pandemic forecasts, and while much of that will be recovered the world economy will still be $1 trillion smaller in 2035 than previously expected. ‚ÄúOne of its impacts has been to redistribute economic momentum between countries with Asia doing best and Europe worst,‚Äù the CEBR said. Other effects have been to ‚Äúfast forward‚Äù existing trends to digitalisation and remote working as well as a shift to a ‚Äúgreener and more tech-based world‚Äù.",,/r/europe/comments/kke83c/britain_is_fifthlargest_economy_in_world_again/gh1yqku/,Ginjamz,1608964900

Remember early this year, when the COVID-19 restrictions started to go back in place across Europe?  [There was a backlog at the German-Polish border in particular](https://www.dw.com/en/traffic-chaos-at-german-polish-border-a-threat-to-local-supply-chains/a-52834298), and a fairly big to-do about it?

&gt; ‚ÄúWe need to keep goods flowing across Europe without obstacles,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThousands of bus and truck drivers are stranded at internal borders on parking lots, creating more health risks and disrupting our supply chains.‚Äù

Like, if you're gonna have have von der Leyen complaining about Poland letting an 18 hour backlog at a border crossing build up, then it seems reasonable to also complain about someone shutting down *all* freight transport between France and the UK starting on the 21st.

2808,"I think that one other point is worth raising: setting aside all issues related to this specific mutation and its spread, the more-general process of COVID-19 mutation is constantly happening globally.  There are constantly, always, mutations happening.  Some of those will be more-successful from an evolutionary standpoint -- makes them spread more-widely.  We expect more-fit versions to replace less-fit ones.  There's nothing about British hosts that makes them specifically prone to their viruses mutating to be more-or-less infectious.  As long as a country has an infected population, the viruses they carry are going to be seeing mutations, and I'd expect the number of new mutations that nature ""tries out"" to be approximately proportional to their infected population.

The United Kingdom has had about (*[checks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_by_country_and_territory)*) 1/40th cases in the world by this count (and I'd guess that the UK is probably less-prone to undercounting than, say, Africa, which I assume has less-ability to test, so that's probably a conservative number).  That means that probably something like 39/40ths of new mutations to make the virus more-successful are happening elsewhere.  That means that we are probably looking through a very small peephole at a portion of a phenomenon happening globally.

On the up side, at least viruses aren't sexual beings.  If a virus gets a useful mutation in Asia and another virus gets a useful mutation in Europe, they aren't going to merge to make one mega-virus incorporating both of the improvements down the line.  They only get the mutations on the single genetic line that is most-successful, not a merger of all of them.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/kka4ne/uk_was_penalised_for_being_first_to_spot_covid/gh1erub/,duisThias,1608949130

2817,"Lmao, how am I suppose to answer this? ¬´This is the default middle eastern response¬ª - you know you‚Äôre tribalizing and generalizing a huge area of well above 250 million people? If some people are always blaming others and you think all do, sure, go on and have this generalized racist assumption about middle easterners. I think it‚Äôs very ignorant however. I‚Äôm not even born and raised in the middle east, but by reading oneself up on the history of the middle east and seeing how things have developed the last two hundred years it‚Äôs not really fair to deem them as digging their own graves and blaming them solely for making mistakes. A lot of the issues today stems from imperialism and foreign intervention. 

How did human rights, social liberties, minority rights etc arise in Europe and in the USA? Through people‚Äôs will to fight for the laws and principles they deemed necessary for a well functioning society - they protested and demonstrated against their autocratic monarchs or colonial overlord. How the fuck are people in e.g. Iran supposed to be able to develop their society and challenge their own rulers  when the US and UK has intervened 2 times to fuck their different leaders over (prime minister, Mossadegh (1953) and the Shah, Reza Pahlavi (1979))- causing the various regimes afterwards to be militant to keep their power and keep order. Iranians protested and demonstrated over a year ago ending in thousands of deaths and also almost 10 years ago which ended with the same - protestors dying. There are still protests from time to time ending with the same result. Is it directly the Us‚Äô or the UK‚Äôs fault? No, but it is obviously a consequence of foreign intervention earlier which led Iran to have the militant regime they have now. I mean if you look to how Iraq has developed and become - how can you not blame foreign intervention there?

In Turkey the situation is obviously different, as it is in Syria, Lebanon, Saudi and Yemen etc. Each country has their own ¬´backstory¬ª. 

So in short; these countries have not been able to progress to the point where these rights and laws are seen as essential to a state and to a society - instead they‚Äôve become fear ladden and militant as a consequence of foreign powers trying to earn unfair amounts of money on their(!) resources, play political games with their leaders/parties/ethnicities and going to war. The region will only prosper and progress when countries like the US stop threatening them and get out of the region - both economically and militarily.

3029,"&gt; All Turkish parties are Turkish nationalist.

See, I told you you couldn't even name one ideologue.

&gt; And most Turks (80-90%) of Turks are nationalist. 

I wish that were true. I really do.

&gt; Turkish nationalism is deeply rooted in Turkish culture so they think it is normal. 

Once again, I really wish that were true. Sadly its not. 

&gt; But for an outsider it is very obvious.

That makes no sense at all. If Turkish nationalism was part of our culture, I'd reckon that we'd be aware of it first. Seems like everyone knows more about our culture than we do.

&gt; There is a reason why they say 'the victor decides what history is'.

Well, that makes it automatically wrong?

&gt; Your story is the story of a Turkish nationalist perspective 

Well, the Kurdish nationalist perspective probably tells the same thing. Given that many of your people languished as little but serfs under feudal lords, which I'm sure you really can't deny. All Kurdish Pashas within the Ottoman empire were members of the noble feudal clans, aristocrats that were given titles and served in the Ottoman army or bureaucracy at some point. The same people that were pretty pissed when their titles and tithes were taken away at the end of the Ottoman Empire. 

&gt; There's always a way to justify oppression.

The only oppressors here are the Kurds themselves. Look at the cadres of the PKK, YPG, the KRG. Almost all of them received their education in Turkish universities. There is no other place in the Middle East that treats your people like fellow human beings.

&gt; No, unlike Turkish nationalism which is inherently exclusionary and racist

Tell that to the Kemalists. They claim its very inclusionary. I personally believe that nationalism is meant to be exclusionary, mainly due to the fact its...NATIONALISM, not INTERNATIONALISM.
I have no idea how Kurdish nationalism is any different from that. Do you give people honorary Kurd certificates or something like that?

&gt;  I would rather have Turks to distance themselves from the anti-Kurdish racism that they practice. 
 
So would I. They're our brothers in faith, aren't they? No reason to be mean towards them. Some people are though, and there really isn't much you can do about that. Same with Kurds who are openly anti-Turkish, mostly on the internet, but I don't really mind.

&gt; That's also the difference between Kurdish and Turkish nationalism.

 The difference between Kurdish and Turkish nationalism is that Kurdish nationalism is often mixed up with some form of communist/anarchist ideology, making it stand out like a Frankenstein. 
Turkish nationalism is on the other hand, rather well fleshed out with many ideologues.

&gt;  Kurdish nationalism is about including

And how?

&gt; So the best way to keep Turkish expansionism at home is to not make them invade you.

I guess the KRG is taking the right steps to prevent that. They're providing us with assistance against the PKK. Thanks KRG.

&gt; I literally gave you the link where Turkish racist Bahceli calls Kurdish cities Turkmen.

I wouldn't say he's entirely wrong, as Erbil was held by successive Turkmen lords and dynasties, but it doesn't really have that many Turkmens in it, like Mosul and Kirkuk. But hey, doesn't matter what we say, the Iraqi government itself doesn't seem to think that these cities belong to you either.

I know problems with bisons, but other animals as well are not limited to problems experienced by farmers. I wouldn't mind having bison, or elk, or ,,only'' dears in my back gardens, especially if I would be compensated, even poorly, for a damage they do, and I do suspect most farmers are OK with it, even if money are not covering fully damages. There are issues with beavers, when compensation doesn't cover level of destruction, that is not an issue with bisons.

 I am more concerned about bisons being present in cities, as it will at some point if their number will start increasing- there are problems with hogs in Gdynia Wejherowo, when their number went up, the animals found food in city and it didn't end up well with interaction with humans- of course it was people's fault, but the price is always paid by animal, usually by death- and increased population of bisons will eventually lead to the same. Few years back, I think in 2010, in Dlugi Brod loner bison has had been killed, after attacking a horse, in Koszalin ( yes, I know, it is far from Podlasie) in 2014 one already started wandering into the city ( it turns out it wasn't visent but american bison, used for company of people), poor Bruno, who cross the german- polish  border  was killed in Lebus/Lubusz, all not so rare any longer car accidents involving bisons- I am more concern about that kind of impact, that those animals do simply have not enough room. If you add problems with relocation: other countries are not eager to reintroduce them en masse, as urbanisation doesn't allow for doing it at the scale of polish programs, than there must be some form of population control, and it leave not many options. It is not about ,,calling to kill bisons'',  it is about limiting grow of population- and yes, population grown at 30-40% at scale of 5 years would lead to unlimited grow without natural predators-  Australia and their problems with camels, or Columbia and Pablo Escabar legacy of hippos.

When rest of Europe was full of land enclosures, landless peasants being forced out into urban areas to suffer and such, or Latin America was with large real estates and so on which all enabled a capital accumulation for bourgeoisie to emerge from bourgs; Ottoman Empire was still with independent peasants that knew no real trade and only produced for self-sufficiency and of course had no interest or potential in being miserable waged labour, etc.",Grotesque Banana Republic of Northern Cyprus,/r/europe/comments/kk43pu/first_printing_press_in_european_countries/gh0tb3m/,cametosaybla,1608934760

3141,"&gt; The Agreement provides for a significant uplift in quota for UK fishers,
equal to 25% of the value the EU catch in UK waters. This is worth ¬£146m for
the UK fleet phased in over five years. It ends the dependence of the UK fleet
on the unfair ‚Äòrelative stability‚Äô mechanism enshrined in the EU‚Äôs Common
Fisheries Policy, and increases the share of the total catch taken in UK waters
taken by UK vessels to circa two thirds.
126. New quota arrangements will be phased in over five years to allow the
respective fleets time to adapt to the changed opportunities. There will be also
be an adjustment period for access to waters which provide stable access for
5 ¬Ω years. For the adjustment period, the Agreement also provides access to
a limited part of the UK territorial waters for vessels which have traditionally
fished in those areas.
127. Under the framework provided for in this Agreement, the UK will
conduct annual fisheries negotiations with the EU alongside negotiations with
other coastal States and international organisations regarding Total Allowable
Catches for shared stock. These negotiations will also cover access
arrangements. 
25
128. The agreement includes arrangements for compensation if a Party
decides not to grant access to its waters and dispute settlement, in the event

The thing is, Turkey had very ambitious founders(mainly Ataturk) but the population was behind the curve and it had things like being one of the very first countries to give women right to elect and be elected (in 1934, way before many western countries) but took quite long time for majority of women to participate in the public life. 

This disparity between Turkey's founders ambitions and the large majority of the population created tensions and political turmoil through the years. There were many military coups, almost every 10-20 years, and there were periods of democracy flourishing. 

Actually, Erdogan in 2002 started his career as a democrat, he introduced many EU laws and the country had almost a decade of improvement. Erdogan was the poster child of democrat-islamist and he was welcomed by the USA and the EU and blind eye was turned when he began squashing the opponents.  Even Obama had his first international visit in Istanbul, Turkey.

Erdogan himself was first banned from politics before 2002 but EU pressured Turkey to grant Erdogan his election rights back. The suspicious ultra seculars were trying to frame him, they managed to frame him for reading a provocative poem.

Are you seriously kidding with me? Worse than the military junta? Do we see Kurdish businessman and intellectuals being killed on a monthly basis now? Do we see extrajudicial killings against Kurds now, to the degree of the military junta? Do we see people getting thrown in to jail and tortured for speaking Kurdish or listening to Kurdish music?

3222,"&gt;‚ÄúFrom June to October we acted like Sweden, which has a population density 10 times lower than ours,‚Äù Giovanni Di Perri, infectious disease expert at the Amedeo di Savoia hospital in Turin, told local media.

I mean, what really matters is how close to other people the average person is.  The population of a country isn't evenly distributed through its landmass.

Like, if Italy suddenly annexed Antarctica, it wouldn't do anything for disease spread in European Italy.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_countries_by_percentage_of_urban_population

At least by this metric, 69% of Italy's population lives in urban areas, versus 86% for  Sweden.

And I doubt that Sweden's cities are ten times less-dense than Italy's.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome

&gt;Density: 2,236/km2 (5,790/sq¬†mi)


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm

&gt;Density: 5,200/km2 (13,000/sq¬†mi)

I'm not sure any country celebrating J√≥l has Santa Claus.

Iceland has 13 j√≥lasveinar (Julelads) who are the sons of trolls. These days they often dress up like American Coca Cola Santa though. Very different from American Santa though.

Other Nordic countries have things like the Julemann and the Christmas Gnomes.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The date of 25th December is a bit of a mystery and there are some  theories, some trace it to some pagan origins, some of these link it to  germanic, and some of these link it to the roman saturnalia. 

25th of December is the birthday of Mithra. A sun god. His holy day was Sunday. Interestingly enough, Mithra and Jesus have more things in common than just a birthday.

When Christianity became more dominant in the Roman empire, they just started celebrating it as Jesus' birthday instead.

3305,"Brexit is finally done. It will leave the UK poorer

Analysis by Hanna Ziady and Julia Horowitz, CNN Business

Updated 1740 GMT (0140 HKT) December 24, 2020 

London (CNN Business)The United Kingdom and the European Union have agreed on a trade deal, closing the book on more than four years of uncertainty over how the country would conduct business with its biggest export market following Brexit.

UK companies are heaving a collective sigh of relief at retaining tariff-free trade with a market of 450 million consumers that buys more than 40% of Britain's exports and provides more than half its imports. The country left the European Union on Jan. 31 but had continued to enjoy its previous trade privileges under transitional arrangements. 

The deal spares the United Kingdom some of the most dire potential consequences from Brexit as it battles a crippling pandemic, and should give a short-term boost to the economy. But the trade agreement will still leave the country poorer at a time when it faces a jobs crisis and the worst recession in more than 300 years.

""The United Kingdom has chosen to leave the European Union and the single market, to renounce the benefits and advantages held by member states,"" EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier told reporters. ""Our agreement does not reproduce these rights and benefits, and therefore despite this agreement there will be real changes in a few days from now.""

The new relationship is expected to lead to a long-run loss of output of around 4% compared to remaining in the European Union, according to the UK Office for Budget Responsibility, which produces economic forecasts for the government. Leaving the EU's single market and customs area means higher costs for UK companies, which could lead to higher consumer prices and even more job losses, as well as reduced export prospects, economists say.

Another drawback: The deal appears to mostly cover trade in goods, where the United Kingdom has a deficit with its EU neighbors, and excludes key service industries like finance, where it currently enjoys a surplus.

""The good news is that a disruptive and acrimonious 'no deal' has been avoided,"" JPMorgan's Malcolm Barr wrote in a research note Thursday before the deal was finalized. ""The bad news for the UK, in our view, is that the EU appears to have secured a deal which allows it to retain nearly all of the advantages it derives from its trading relationship with the UK, while giving it the ability to use regulatory structures to cherry pick among the sectors where the UK had previously enjoyed advantages in the trading relationship.""

Here are some of the major challenges facing the battered UK economy when the Brexit transition ends on Jan. 1.


Trade barriers

UK companies are losing unfettered access to the European Union. While a deal means that exporters have been spared the pain of having costly tariffs slapped on their goods, new import and export declarations alone will cost UK companies ¬£7.5 billion ($10.3 billion) annually, according to Britain's revenue authority. 

Costs will rise rapidly if new customs checks delay goods at the border and snarl supply chains, forcing factories to pause production. UK ports are already gridlocked, partly as a result of stockpiling ahead of Brexit, with industry groups representing retailers and food producers warning that pressure will only increase when the transition period ends.

Lufthansa airlifts fresh food to England as UK border chaos continues

Even before France abruptly closed the border following a warning from UK officials of a new, more infectious coronavirus variant, Honda was forced to halt production at a major plant in England for three days in December because it couldn't get the parts it needed.

While the government will phase in border checks over the coming months to avoid choking off vital supplies, truckers and transportation companies are among those warning of dire consequences. Rod McKenzie, head of policy and public affairs at the Road Haulage Association, told CNN Business earlier this month that supply chain hiccups could mean that factories aren't able to work. There could also be ""gaps on supermarket shelves,"" he added.

That situation could be made worse by backups from this week. While France has reopened ferry ports and the Eurotunnel rail link, thousands of trucks remained stranded Wednesday morning with their drivers waiting for the negative Covid-19 tests they need to travel. Supermarkets such as Tesco (TSCDY) and Sainsbury's (JSAIY) were struggling to keep their shelves stocked with fresh fruit and vegetables, and Toyota (TM) closed its UK and French plants early for Christmas. 

""The clock is still very much ticking for businesses,"" Jonathan Geldart, director general of the Institute of Directors, a lobby group, said in a statement Thursday. ""Digesting what the changes mean in practice and adapting, in the middle of a pandemic and the festive season while border disruptions continue, is a huge ask.""

Worker shortages

Britain's new immigration system, which takes effect in January, is designed to reduce the number of unskilled workers coming to the United Kingdom and end what the government describes as the country's ""reliance on cheap, low-skilled labor."" 

Immigration was a key issue in the 2016 Brexit referendum. As an EU member, Britain was part of a bloc that allowed the free movement of people. That meant companies were able to easily employ EU citizens in sectors such as farming, social care and the National Health Service. 

The number of EU workers coming to the United Kingdom has fallen sharply since 2016, and employers are worried about labor shortages, even though immigration from non-EU countries has been on the rise.

UK farms need 70,000 to 80,000 seasonal workers each year for a successful harvest, according to the National Farmers' Union. The NFU is lobbying government to introduce a seasonal worker program, without which some farmers have warned that in the worst case crops could be left in the fields to rot. 

""Workers from outside the UK are absolutely vital to the success of our horticultural sector,"" NFU vice president Tom Bradshaw told CNN Business last week. ""We are at a critical time in recruitment for many growers. As freedom of movement ends on Dec. 31, [growers] still don't know where they will recruit experienced workers from.""

Loss of investment

Years of uncertainty over the future terms of EU trade have already damaged the UK economy. GDP growth in the three years after the June 2016 Brexit referendum slowed to 1.6% as business investment stagnated, according to analysts at Berenberg.

Greater clarity over Britain's future relationship with the European Union could help. A survey conducted by EY in April found that 24% of investors regard Brexit as a risk factor, down from 38% last year. According to EY, there was a slight increase in the number of inbound foreign direct investment projects into Britain in 2019, ending three years of decline.

""A deal [will] unlock significant investment in UK and support the recovery once the ongoing coronavirus shock starts to fade,"" Berenberg economists told clients Thursday.

But there's still a risk that foreign companies, including Japanese carmakers such as Nissan (NSANF) and Honda (HMC), will no longer view the United Kingdom as a launchpad into Europe. 

That may already be happening. Chinese investment across the whole of Europe has increased since the Brexit referendum but declined in the United Kingdom, said EY. Global banks have been moving some of their operations out of London to cities in the European Union. 

Financial services snags

Worries that London would quickly lose its status as Europe's financial capital to the likes of Frankfurt or Paris after the Brexit vote in 2016 have turned out to be overstated.

The United Kingdom remains the world's biggest net exporter of financial services, with its ¬£60.3 billion ($81.6 billion) trade surplus in 2019 outpacing rivals including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore, according to a report by TheCityUK, a lobby group.

Still, international financial services firms have migrated ¬£1.2 trillion ($1.6 trillion) worth of assets and relocated 7,500 jobs from Britain to the European Union since the 2016 referendum, according to publicly available data tracked by EY. Dublin, Luxembourg, Frankfurt and Paris have been the major beneficiaries.

The European Union and United Kingdom have not yet struck a deal that will give UK banks and asset managers access to European markets. EU regulators are unlikely to let London keep the benefits of the single market without its obligations. 

""While a deal is welcome, financial and related professional services are clear-eyed about the need for both sides to continue to develop the relationship in services in the years ahead,"" Miles Celic, CEO of TheCityUK, said in a statement Thursday.

Some outside countries receive preferential market access rights from the European Union, a standard known as ""equivalence."" The level of market access is worse than what the United Kingdom currently enjoys, but it's the best the country can hope for once outside the European Union. 

Major banks say they have prepared for Brexit, and the new terms of trade with the European Union won't disrupt their operations while negotiations continue over equivalence.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/kjylok/analysis_brexit_is_finally_done_it_will_leave_the/ggzumhk/,Flumpki,1608912576

Scotlands economy is so heavily tied to the UK‚Äôs that independence would inevitably, even if only temporarily, completely screw the Scottish economy. Scotland does not have the resources or services to support itself as of now, almost completely relying off of Tertiary services to uphold its economy, much like the UK‚Äôs.

3451,"Well...small farms have more overhead than large farms.

The bulk of what one can do to increase wealth in a country is to shift to more-efficient processes -- can't improve the economy if one freezes its processes in place.

Happens everywhere.  [We've seen the same phenomenon in the US](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Z2JCOG4HIAZ5XHXO6Q643OOP3E.png&amp;w=916).

Most wealthy countries in the EU operate larger farms than poorer countries.

https://www.independent.ie/incoming/ba5f2/37067195.ece/AUTOCROP/w1000/eurostat%202.PNG

https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Agriculture_statistics_-_family_farming_in_the_EU

&gt; Only 11pc of farm managers in the EU were younger than 40 years old, in contrast to one third (32pc) who were 65 years of age or older.

When people talk about [urbanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization), people around the world moving to cities, it's because a large chunk of the population that was involved with more-labor-intensive farming out in the country isn't doing so any more.

I mean, nobody's gonna make a *law* banning small farms.  But my guess is that what will happen is (a) competition in a commodity market will drive prices for produce down and (b) labor costs will rise, as people have access to higher pay in other areas, so it becomes harder to find workers.  The people swelling cities via urbanization are doing so because they're choosing not to work on farms.  The combination of those just means that smaller farms become increasingly-less-economically-impractical.

I mean, it's disruptive for farmers who have to transition out of farming, but that's true of all industries.  Was disruptive for blacksmithing when people moved to automobiles.  Was disruptive for painting when the photograph came along.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/kjko5q/rural_eu_citizens_more_antieuropean_and/ggzm5z1/,duisThias,1608905996

3491,"&gt;Every country benefits from the European single market and the freedom of movement and if some countries are less successful

Way too much of a simplistic view. Compare it to a situation in your own country. You surely see how big cities are draining away the economic activity from surrounding smaller towns and villages? People move to the city, shops close, jobs disappear, services go away, etc etc. Now do this on a European scale.

You say it yourself, jobs here pay better. So we leave poorer countries with a lack of talent. Yet you say it is up to them to improve. But it is harder to improve when your people are moving away somewhere else. That is why we need monetary transfers. Everyone benefits, but not in the same way. Which is why we in Western Europe need to make sure we also invest in Eastern Europe to lift those areas up as well. In what way, how much and under what conditions is of course a constant discussion and will change over time depending on the developments. For example, right now we can decrease the investments in Poland, but need to figure out how to deal with countries like Greece. And that is a challenge. You don't fix that by just saying ""fuck you, you fail at improving.""

&gt;So we are benefitting from transit fees to the Ukraine and increased gas prices? We are benefitting from transfer payments while all we get are the same rights and the same access to the EU market as everyone else? We are benefitting from bailing out financially irresponsible countries? Great logic you have there.

You benefit from stability and partners economically improving so you can export goods and services to them over time.

&gt;If you feel the need of taking those allies and neighbours into account for a bit (which is your pathetic way of downplaying the many billions we pay to them every year) you can do all of that with your own money (or get your country to do it) and get your greedy little fingers off of our money.

""Our money"" is being printed by the ECB day after day right now. No single cent of your taxes goes towards these things. Not an ideal system by far and it has large downsides, but let's stop with this narrative where you pretend your taxes are all being spent to Ukrainian transfer fees and money transfers to other EU countries, since that is just lies. It's an easy way to get people riled up, it's however far from the truth of how things work.

It also fucks over the entire agency market. In germany, for example, you get paid a fixed amount of money per month.

Should you work more hours you dont get the extra ones paid out but they go into a time account, so you can take a paid day off or something. Or you get it paid out once the tike account is full. Whatever happens first.

Norwegian goods can be traded freely without tariffs, they don't need any custom checks and they don't need any additional regulatory approval or meet any additional specifications, since Norway follows EU regulations.

British goods on the other hand can only be traded freely without tariffs. They still need to go through custom checks, they need to apply for regulatory approval, they need to prove that they meet the specifications if they want to be sold in the Single market and so on.

Nobody ever said that a free trade agreement wasn't possible, but that access to the single market wasn't with the UK red lines. After all, a core pillar of the single market is having the same regulations and certification procedures on products, so they can be sold anywhere in the market.

We got along much better when the union wasn't overstretched and included rogue countries like Poland and Hungary. 

Then the UK launched an illegal and fraudulent invasion of Iraq with the US and our continent was labeled old Europe because we dared not to follow their masters. And when the refugee crisis began, the UK refused to own up to its shit and dumped the consequences of its actions on Greece and Italy before, and Germany, Austria, Sweden, etc. 

Or have you forgotten that the Iraqi city of Mosul was the first capital of ISIS and its most important one? Or that Cameron and Sarkozy turned Libya inton a no man's land ripe for human trafficking? And that the UK again took just a couple of refugees while they were the main culprits.

And when the EU in 2011 wanted to reform the financial markets and avoid another Lehman Brothers crisis, Cameron vetoed the deal and the EU was forced to find a way around it through an intergovernmental deal.

You are confusing degrees with the teaching languages in school. Even then, lots of people who study humanities land well paying jobs. Examples include rhetorics, public relations, sales representatives, human resources, communications, etc.


&gt; Take me to this utopian world you live in.

All right. I'll show you around in Denmark.

&gt; Scientifically unsupportable claim. 

It is a fact that studying languages involves questions of logic, philosophy, art and scientific nature. 

Examples: 

- Grammar has logical elements

- Etymological questions revolve around how language shapes our understanding of the world. (Philosophical in nature). Philosophy is a broad field anyway so claiming language studies don't touch upon this field is quite a big claim. Nonetheless, the pedantic nature of philosophy requires a thorough understanding of the language in which the work is carried out.


- Art: Literature. Need I say more?


- Scientific. All studies of anything are scientific by definition, but I imagine that you're thinking about things that are more technical in nature, of which language studies have several and linguistics is the most obvious. 


&gt; Great. How does a language do that more than any other field of study.

It doesn't. All areas do that to the same degree and no field is more useful or useless than another in this respect.


&gt; Vastly more people are employed in and around chemistry than with their 2nd language.


Learning a language is not only a question about mastering the grammar of that language. In order to communicate ideas and thoughts in that second language, a knowledge of the culture and society revolving this language is required. The second part of your statement revolves around the usefulness of learning a 2nd language in the first place and I just have to say that that is quite useful in an obvious way. For example, my first language is Danish (around 5-6 mil. speakers) and I would never be able to work with anyone who doesn't speak Danish if that was my only language. It would severely limit my opportunities.

Their location would complicate things, but it's a much better option than total independence.

They haven;t even left yet. That shouldn't pose a problem. Of course the longer they're out, the more complicated it gets.

&gt; But yes, voting in a democracy is almost always down heart over head, mainly because most people aren‚Äôt educated on what they are voting on, so just vote on what they feel is right, rather than what they think is right.

It's not just a matter of education. There's a sizable portion of the population which is not penny pinching, and has income and wealth that they don't have to worry about a nickel and a dime.

Russians didn't speak the local language and didn't support the right of the natives to have their own country. Which is exactly the same what happened in Ukraine, which is exactly the same was could've happened in Baltic states (so that Baltic states had to take extreme measures to limit the political influence of local Russians, such as depriving people of citizenship to avoid secession/war), and which is exactly the same what is happening with ethnic Russians in Belarus. Russians in Soviet Union were used as colonisers by the Soviet government and these people were happy to be colonisers, without learning the local languages and customs, and enforcing their own upon true natives of the region.

3743,"Nothing to complain about. It's simply two separate winter solstice celebrations with different roots and different names, that have evolved to become essentially the same celebration these days.

Anyway, one hails from Rome:

&gt;...  around the time of the winter solstice, Romans observed Juvenalia, a  feast honoring the children of Rome. In addition, members of the upper  classes often celebrated the birthday of Mithra, the god of the  unconquerable sun, on December 25. It was believed that Mithra, an infant god, was born of a rock. For some Romans, Mithra‚Äôs birthday was  the most sacred day of the year. 

Mithra is a sun god born to a virgin on the 25th of December. His holy day was the Sunday. There are many other similarities, but that's a discussion for another day. Either way, those are two separate religions, regardless any similarities. Almost every religion borrows something from other religions and that's that.

As Christianity became a dominant religion, they simply switched Mithra out for Jesus and kept on going like before.

J√≥l though was an old Nordic/Germanic winter festival that had nothing *per se* to do with Mithra and even less to do with Christmas. They were both celebrated in the exact same way. Like every other midwinter celebration around the globe.

&gt;On Christmas, believers attended church, then celebrated raucously in a drunken, carnival-like atmosphere... 

People basically just got drunk with their friends and if a holy place was close by, they might just go there to meet up with people before getting drunk. In the Nordics it was usually pretty cold and dark this time of year, so traveling to a holy place might have been less likely. But yeah, everyone just got drunk really.

You're right though that J√≥l was not always celebrated on the 24th/25th of December.

&gt;By holding Christmas at the same time as traditional [winter solstice](https://www.history.com/topics/natural-disasters-and-environment/winter-solstice)  festivals, church leaders increased the chances that Christmas would be  popularly embraced, but gave up the ability to dictate how it was  celebrated.

So just as Jesus got Mithra's day, J√≥l eventually got Jesus' day. But nothing else really changed. The church didn't even really try to change anything else. They knew from experience it was too much effort for no real gain. So the celebrations kept on going as they always had. Everyone just kept on getting drunk. Everyone kept on calling it J√≥l. To this day, everyone still does.

In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter though. Everything evolves. Everything changes. Just as people don't celebrate the birth of Mithra any more, fewer and fewer people celebrate the birth of Jesus.

Yet one thing holds true throughout the ages. The world population loves to celebrate and have a good time around midwinter. The time when the sun starts rising again and the days get longer.

3849,"From the very beginning, the whole question of British and European integration has turned fundamentally on the question of sovereignty, as Ursula von der Leyen accepted this afternoon. Those who favoured membership then and now dismiss sovereignty as a meaningless or outdated notion in a world of interconnection. The events of the last four years, and perhaps even more the last few days, should have made them think again. The question of fishing had the merit of making sovereignty concrete and understandable, which is why it became suddenly so crucial. You may decide to give or lend certain rights or powers to others, but who makes that decision? Who has the power to make the decision stick? In a nutshell, that is sovereignty, as fundamental today as ever.

When we voted in 2016, it was not wholly clear whether the United Kingdom was still a sovereign country. Professor Vernon Bogdanor, the eminent constitutional specialist, was not alone among legal experts in considering that the European Communities Act (1972) abrogated the sovereignty of parliament by recognising the legislative and judicial superiority of the EEC, and later the EU. The easy answer was that parliament could repeal that Act. The more difficult question was: would it? The decision was handed to the electorate in the 2016 referendum. Again, an act of sovereignty, this time exercised by the people. But again, as we all know, the real question was whether that decision would be carried out.

Only then was the true question of sovereignty posed, not as a discussion among constitutional lawyers, but as raw political reality. Was the United Kingdom still a sovereign state? Whatever the legal theory, if the UK had given in to pressure and voted again to reverse its decision, it would have ceased in practice to be a sovereign state for the indefinite future. Sovereignty that cannot be exercised is sovereignty lost. By this criterion, EU member states (most obviously Greece, Ireland and Italy, and perhaps others where popular votes have been overruled) have in reality given up their sovereignty. Perhaps, indeed, they all have. President Macron frequently talks of ‚Äòa sovereign Europe‚Äô. He may be right. Which other EU country, however much it grumbles, will dare to exit?

Britain‚Äôs uncertainty was ended by a reassertion of sovereignty by the entity that ultimately holds it in a democracy: the people. The referendum vote was confirmed by a series of elections. But the reality of sovereignty was still not secured. Sovereignty needs agents: in this case, Boris Johnson, his government, and his negotiators led by David Frost. Frost in a speech in Brussels last February said that ‚Äòthe EU must, if it is to achieve what it wants in the world, find a way of relating to its neighbours as friends and genuinely sovereign equals.‚Äô

This seemed to have fallen on deaf ears. The EU had at first threatened that Britain would be left ‚Äòvery lonely on the edge of the Atlantic,‚Äô in the words of Manfred Weber, leader of the European People‚Äôs Party in the European Parliament. But when the Johnson government said that third-country status was just what it wanted, the EU insisted on the contrary that the UK must accept a dependent relationship because of its ‚Äòeconomic interconnectedness and geographical proximity‚Äô. David Frost, in a polite but forthright letter on 19 May, retorted that this ‚Äòis not an argument that can hope to be accepted in the 21st century.‚Äô

The EU appeared not to agree. Like a nineteenth-century imperial power, it was claiming that the UK must remain in its sphere of influence. Fishing rights, although in economic terms relatively minor, crystallised the issue. So did the reasonable-sounding demands for a ‚Äòlevel playing field‚Äô ‚Äì the EU has shown a remarkable ability to control the linguistics of the debate. In fact it was insisting that the UK should remain subject to its own legislation and its own legal order. No neutral arbitration was to be permitted. By the end, it was demanding the right to control British law and policy over an indeterminate range of issues: anything, in fact, that it judged damaging to its own interest ‚Äì which was not only to maintain its profitable export surplus in the UK, but even more to maintain the EU as ‚Äòsovereign Europe‚Äô.

If the government had accepted this, would we in reality have been a sovereign state? Would we have been a real democracy, for democracy is meaningless without sovereignty? Or would we, like the unfortunate Greeks and Italians, have in reality accepted that we could no longer make political choices that were not approved by the EU? As Jean-Claude Juncker had summed it up bluntly, ‚ÄòIl ne peut y avoir de choix d√©mocratique contre les trait√©s europ√©ens‚Äô. A former British representative to the EU proclaimed in the House of Lords, with seeming satisfaction, ‚ÄòWe will huff and puff but, in the end, we will basically come to heel.‚Äô

Well, today it seems we haven‚Äôt. Over the last few days in Brussels, the much vaunted unity of the EU seems to have crumbled. Despite what some 'Remainers' and pro-EU media in Britain have constantly proclaimed for four years, the British government showed that it meant what it said and calmly played its trump card. If the EU did not respect our sovereign rights, there would be no agreement and Britain would willingly trade on WTO terms. The EU knew what it stood to lose, and it sensibly backed down. Let us hope that this is the beginning of a period of sensible and friendly relations between the UK and the EU, rather than a new phase in the tug of war of the last four years. The challenge now is for present and future British governments to show that sovereignty is not an empty word, but the means of increasing the welfare of its people, finding a role in the world and consolidating the United Kingdom itself.",,/r/europe/comments/kjuldd/the_eu_knew_what_it_stood_to_lose_and_backed_down/ggyxjsb/,casualphilosopher1,1608878149

This was always and will always be a stupid line: it implies that freedom of movement for people is a price to pay for free movements of goods. 

That freedom of movement isn't really positive for itself. It's a defeatist attitude for anyone who supports freedom of movement.

As it'd be beyond silly for the EU to create frictions on trade with the UK (and politically impossible, European exporters would create hell for politicians - we're not talking about a couple of farms and factories becoming inviable here), the EU position should have always been ""Wow, the UK is abdicating from freedom of movement, which is a great thing per se"". 

Basically the EU in the last few years have convinced everyone that freedom of movement is a cost, but a necessary one to keep a frictionless goods market.

Lots of countries just make a language mandatory until late in one's school education, or even to the end, or make it a mandatory requirement of university access.

As for grammar, lots of research shows that metaknowledge of language confers no real benefits in terms of calibre of writing or expression. Natives internalise the grammar of their language throughout their development, and having errors pointed out, which a native speaker can recognise as a mistake due to their internalised awareness of English grammar even if they can't explain it, is enough to produce capable writers.

3988,"There is certainly a degree of assimilation. Besides the language, there aren't any other differences, and even before that there was some degree of bilingualism. 

The map does not show the ""original coverage of the Slavic language in Greece,"" because during Ottoman times - which is the period before the demographic changes that take place during the Balkan Wars, and later the Great War - because the coverage was more extensive one. The picture in Ottoman Macedonia (which is what I assume you mean by ""Greece"" here) was a lot more complicated than just a comparison between Greeks and Slavs. You should keep in mind that by the late 19th and early 20th c. most Slavic-speakers in Ottoman Macedonia identified as Bulgarians, and anyone who did not, de facto remained loyal to the Roman Patriarchate of Constantinople and were effectively Slavic-speaking Romans, and were in many cases bilingual. On the ground of course there were hundreds of thousands of Muslims, which included various ethnicities within the Muslim community (for example the Muslims of south-western Macedonia were Greek-speaking (Roman-speaking). Another important group was the Jewish community of Thessaloniki (sometimes simplified as Salonica), which in the preceding period before the wars was the largest community of the city (Greeks and Muslims tied for second. 

Broadly speaking Greek-speakers were concentrated in urban areas and towards the coasts across the area (including Ottoman Epirus, Macedonia, and Thrace). The Black Sea coast of modern Bulgaria, for example, had extensive Greek (Roman) populations. In-land you found more Muslim and Slavic-speaking populations. Of course this is a simplification. Again the picture was more complicated than what modern borders (or more importantly nationalist narratives) imply. For example, the city of Florina, in modern day Greece, used have a higher Slavic-speaking population, while Monastiri or Monastir (Slavic name Bitola), today in North Macedonia, had a larger Greek community. Again few cities or regions were exclusively anything.

Yes.

Then, after having disgraced the once venerable Royal Navy by having her go after French and Spanish trawlers in the event, it all came down to a few tons of fish, for which the Johnson government basically bailed on everything else (financial services, non-tariff trade barriers, level playing field).

4115,"&gt; VVD policy in NL is different then the faction in the EU parliament. More EU is a no go. You missed the fight about coronabond...

I didn't miss it. I'm just noticing the incoherence (or hypocrisy)  between their domestic policy and their political affiliation in the EU parliament. If they were really as eurosceptic as they claim, they would leave renew for a group more in line with their domestic stance, such as EPP or ECR. 

&gt; yeah really pro EU integration. D66 is about to lose big. GroenLinks is irrelevant since VVD and CDA prefer not to rule with them for being too leftish

except that your previous claim was that there was only one pro eu party in NL and now you're shifting your goal post by saying that those two are about to be irrelevant. Ignoring that they had quite a surge in the last general elections and that D66 is the 3rd largest party in the States General (ex aequo with CDA IRRC).

&gt; If you expect fast federalisation now with the UK gone you will be very disappointed.

I don't expect it to happen that fast and I am not sure I would want it. At times I find some of its advocates like Verhofstadt a bit too much to take. I just don't want the Brits to be in it. Never made sense to have them in the first place. Things were much better when the EU was smaller.

4233,"&gt;At least I can say stuff online about my countries wrong doings and atrocities. 

You still can't see the irony. Oh well.

Censorship comes in different forms. China's censorship is blatant. China will order its internet companies to remove speech it deems harmful to national security. National security is a broad term. You're American so I'm sure you can appreciate this. The US has ""guaranteed"" free speech so your censorship works by spamming fake news. Both version of censorship drowns out the truth. 

From a social media perspective, American and Chinese social media companies behave similarly. Both practice blatant censorship. Google, Youtube, Instagram, Facebook, etc all censor speech. 

In terms of the effectiveness of speech, the United States has shown speech is irrelevant to political discourse or achieving political change. Your country continues to commit murder, genocide, torture, wage war across the planet, and run actual concentration camps. This has been happening for decades. What exactly has your speech done? 

&gt;Try commenting from China on anything about China‚Äôs atrocities or minority cleansing, and see what happens to you and your internet.

The funny thing is we repost a lot of the things Westerners say about China on Weibo and we joke about how misled you people are. Some of the more extreme hateful posts about China will get deleted but I have never heard of anyone getting arrested. 

As for China's atrocities, you have to be more specific. It exists but it's more a regional thing and occurs at local levels. This stuff is talked about all the time. People actually beg the central government to step in. 

Nobody talks about minority cleansing because it's not happening. It's really just that simple. People living in China know what prison transfers in China look like. We know buildings with walls surrounding them are not concentration camps because our school campus in Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, etc looks identical. We know China has a wall culture where even parks are surrounded by walls, so when US funded organizations claim buildings surrounded by walls are concentration camps, we just laugh. We know WeChat QR codes are not used by police to ""[quickly scan to learn everything about the establishment and its connections](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623050100/https://twitter.com/nrg8000/status/1275291522955530244)"" because we use WeChat Pay everywhere.

4298,"&gt;In April 2019, it seemed all was lost. Almost three years after the referendum, Theresa May‚Äôs wobbling Government initiated negotiations with Jeremy Corbyn‚Äôs Labour Party to achieve a non-Brexit Brexit. The talks were founded on the principle of surrendering our trade policy to the European Union as a member of a customs union, while acquiescing to EU regulations.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is hard to underestimate how close this country came to throwing away the 2016 referendum result. As deadline after deadline was missed, those who lost the referendum received more and more concessions. From European Court of Justice oversight to commitments to remain chained to the EU‚Äôs failed economic model ‚Äì a virtual colony trapped within the Brussels regulatory orbit. On this side of the Channel, Brexiteers were confronted daily by the scheming of a thoroughly rotten Parliament abetted by a partisan speaker and activist legal establishment.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is from this context that we must view today. From a time almost all was lost to a moment it appears almost all has been won. Ironically the biggest symbol of Brexit failure was what acted to turn the tide. The European Parliamentary Elections should never have happened. The fact we sent pretend parliamentarians to a toothless institution of the European Union three years after we voted to leave it was astonishing. Yet it allowed the country‚Äôs despondency to turn to determination.  
&gt;  
&gt;It was not until the Tories slipped into single figures in that election, which Nigel Farage once again won, that jittery MPs woke up. With Tories and Labour vying for third and fourth place in national polls, May‚Äôs chapter in charge had to end. And yet while the country‚Äôs leadership, and the course of the Brexit negotiations changed, the hysteria and nonsense of political discourse did not.  
&gt;  
&gt;Formerly respected or at least level-headed people went completely off the wall. Some¬†invented or promoted conspiracy theories, claiming that the¬†referendum was 'rigged' or merely a devious ‚Äúdisaster capitalism‚Äù scheme, pretending the Prime Minister was deliberately trying to cause No Deal in order to crash the economy and help people who have shorted the pound. Even Philip Hammond bought into the latter, writing a year ago in The Times that the Prime Minister wants No Deal because he is ‚Äúbacked by speculators who have bet billions‚Äù on it. Faced with a soaring pound, these invented speculators must be demanding their money back today.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sir Keir Starmer even argued that Boris‚Äôs Withdrawal Agreement itself was ‚Äúa trap door to no deal‚Äù. Authority figures repeatedly told us that negotiating a Free Trade Agreement in just 11 months was unprecedented and impossible. How wrong they were. I‚Äôm not about to pretend I‚Äôve read thousands of pages of legal text quite yet, so let me reserve full judgement. Yet if this is the first free trade deal in history to secure zero tariff and zero quota access to another market, all while avoiding ECJ jurisdiction, escaping the EU‚Äôs regulatory orbit, and ending membership fees, all in the space of 11 months then that is truly a feat to be proud of.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the BBC‚Äôs 2016 Wembley debate, days before the referendum, the PM said ""They say we can't do it. We say we can. They say we have no choice but to bow down to Brussels. We say they are woefully underestimating this country and what it can do"".  
&gt;  
&gt;For the years of increasingly depressing talk of 'dynamic alignment', 'a common rulebook', 'a single customs territory' and ECJ jurisdiction, you would have been forgiven for thinking that belief was wrong. Yet today Boris rubbished those words in his press conference, saying they have been banished to this history books.  
&gt;  
&gt;Echoing the Wembley debate all those years ago, the PM said this deal ""achieves something that the people of this country instinctively knew was doable but which they were told was impossible.‚Äù ‚ÄòBelieve in Britain‚Äô is a phrase that is widely mocked throughout the chattering classes. For many, they prefer to project an idea of Britain as washed up and irrelevant with its best days in the past.  
&gt;  
&gt;Well today, perhaps, that should change. We should all be willing and able to recognise an achievement. Good will and belief in your country is no bad thing. Happy Brexmas.",,/r/europe/comments/kjluj7/brexiteers_almost_lost_everything_now_they_have/ggxdwmb/,Robi_damian,1608840442

If by living like Europeans you mean living in an advanced country then of course I would agree. But once again, why France ? There are many countries that are far more advanced than France. 



But cultural influence ? No thanks. Why is French music, clothing, language, thinkers good but it‚Äôs bad when it‚Äôs from other countries ? Sorry but this is proof of an inferiority complex. If you think French culture is superior to Turkish culture it‚Äôs an inferiority complex. I can prefer reading books from any countries if it‚Äôs better than Rousseau‚Äôs. If you can‚Äôt name good Turkish, Arabic, Chinese etc thinkers then it‚Äôs your fault and if you prefer Rousseau over them just because he‚Äôs French that‚Äôs stupid.


As for the government, well you can either like them or not, I don‚Äôt care, that is not the point of our debate but you can‚Äôt say the Ottoman culture is non-existent. That is so false. Why do all Balkan countries (Turkey included) share similar traditions, music, food, mentality, etc ? It‚Äôs all the remains of the Ottoman culture. The French culture and ideology was forced onto the Turkish people in the early days of the republic. Notice I said forced and not adopted.

4454,"Incorrect in the case of the UK at least. We have a parliamentary democracy and parliament is sovereign under our constitution. The people have the power to change who makes up that parliament, but we ultimately have no say in the laws and agreements we're signed up to. This is why referenda under UK law have no legally binding outcomes (unless that part of the constitution was changed by parliament) and ultimately require an act of parliament for anything to take effect. 

Now, Parliament sacrifices parts of it's sovereignty in any Trade deal or treaty it signs with other nations for the period that those agreements exist, but because Parliament is always ultimately sovereign in the UK it can decide to withdraw from those agreements as and when it chooses (as with brexit) subject to understanding the repercussions of doing so.

The point is, and likely the reason she has said that is that Sovereignty in the UK is very much a defined thing, it's just that nobody who used it as an argument during brexit actually understood what they were talking about. It was a word that was used to describe a sense of english exceptionalism where people felt that we shouldn't have to follow rules and regulations that we had already agreed to and if we didn't want to follow them, it shouldn't affect any arrangements we had.

Etnas eruption in 1669 according to wiki destroyed 10 villages, lava flowed for 5 *weeks* and it would've destroyed Catania too, had not the walls protected it.
Little damage indeed..

A volcanic eruption can last for a *long* time. Sometimes multiple years. They can also be seen from hundreds of kilometres away, with both Ash pillars and lava fountains that can stretch multiple kilometres up in the air.

Eyjafjallaj√∂kulls eruption in 2010 lasted from March to October and affected flights across entire Europe.

A volcano also makes noise even when it is not erupting, again as a constant reminder. Plus, you know - a stationary mountain that everyone can see.

4664,"&gt;Ah, wellbeing! Not mentally ill after all. Seems like you were just victimizing yourself then. I don't really see how being on a PB diet decreases your wellbeing? I feel perfectly fine and am vegan for more than 7 years.

What the fuck is wrong with you? Are you just trying to force strawmen?

I focus on my own wellbeing before i focus on others. Therefore id like to fix my mental instability before i start to worry about dietary problems.

I can't really be on any diet since i can't keep that degree of activity/responsibility over my own life.

&gt;""avoid"" as in not consume at all and just find the ""eThIcAlLy SlAuGhTeReD aNiMaLs""? Conveniently speaking (which is your only reason), might as well get vegetables straight from any supermarket

Avoid as in avoid slaughterhouses and buy my produce from local farms yes. How many times do i have to repeat it.

&gt;Do you also think you are morally superior to those who kill dogs for pleasure? Or who hunt for sports? Their wellbeing may depend on it...

No i don't think im morally superior. Just different. They have morals i don't agree with but not because i think mine are ""better"". Superiority game is one that never ends.

&gt;So I still do not understand what your reason to kill is? I don't see any other way to relate ""mental wellbeing""?

Well this might be more semantics but i feel like the word necessity fits better. I am not on a semi vegan diet now since i am quite certain i couldn't keep it up and it would just worsen my life instead of bettering it. When i am more mentally stable i am willing to attempt it.

&gt;The possibility for a social contract isn't a social contract.

&gt;That's my UNO reverse card. You have no idea what you are talking about when you say ""social contract tho"".

You are corrext, it however is not what I'm trying to say. I am saying that the possibility of forming a contract with them in the future makes it reasonable to hold them to that standard. I do see a possibility of forming a contract with an indigenous tribes so i will treat them as such. I don't see one with animals.

&gt;How arrogant of you? What makes you think that aliens are going to see us worthy of any social contract whatsoever?!! The societal and cognitive capacities difference between them and us may very well be even higher than that between us and non-human animals. And as I said, they objectively have no social contract with us. The potential to have one isn't a social contract.

Its completely possible that we wouldn't be able to form contracts with an alien race. That is why i said its possible not guaranteed.

&gt;Besides, we have a social contract with pets. Why not extend that to the animals you eat?

Eh the pet thing i have to study more i guess. I kind of see pets just as entertainment people keep around or some form of comfort. I don't think the pet and its owner share anything more than that.

That being said i haven't owned a pet so i should look at it more to understand better.",,/r/europe/comments/khymd6/spains_most_expensive_drug_jamon_de_jabugo/ggwdzsw/,GuessMyMein69,1608819300

Russia can easily block gas exports to individual countries in the future, those countries will then buy Russian gas from Germany at a premium.

Eastern countries will never really be shut of from gas, meaning it's an easy trigger to pull for the Russians, however high energy prices hurt their economies fundamentally. 

As an added bonus, once they rely on their gas and pricing from Germany, Germany holds the reigns on them. 

I can see only one advantage, Eastern Europe needs to get renewable energy going ASAP, and stop burning gas. Or they need to build much more coal and/or nuclear plants.

4959,"An agreement signed on August 6 this year for the partial demarcation of maritime boundaries between Greece and Egypt was posted on the United Nation‚Äôs Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea on Thursday, by the organisation‚Äôs Office of Legal Affairs.

The deal designates an exclusive economic zone in the eastern Mediterranean, which in turn gives the two countries rights over natural resources in the region.

Greek diplomatic sources said that the importance of this action lies in the speed with which it happened and in the fact that the President of the UN General Assembly is Volkan Bozkir, a Turkish national.

The publishing of the deal by the UN, in combination with the delay in the posting of an accord signed between Turkey and the internationally recognized government of Libya in November 2019 is the result of a long effort by Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias, who is in regular contact with the Secretary-General of the UN, Antonio Guterres, the same sources said.

Dendias met three times with the Portuguese top UN official in recent months - twice in Geneva and most recently in New York last September.

This is also the first deal to be published on the delimitation of maritime zones between Greece and a neighboring country in four decades.

4963,"The report by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and the European Law Enforcement Agency (Europol) decried growing gang violence and drug-related homicide in Europe, and cited the terrorist PKK‚Äôs role in this.

‚ÄúThe PKK ‚Ä¶ has been reported to be involved in organized crime, with few examples of its engagement in the drug trade in the EU,‚Äù says the 260-page 2019 EU Drug Market Report.

The document explains the drug market‚Äôs links to wider criminal activities, human trafficking, and terrorism.

‚ÄúOrganized crime may feed terrorism through a variety of channels, including supplying weapons, financing terrorist activities through drug distribution and infiltrating financial markets,‚Äù it warns.

In its more than 30-year terror campaign against Turkey, the PKK -- listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the EU -- has been responsible for deaths of 40,000 people, including women, children and infants. Turkey has stressed the PKK‚Äôs pivotal role in European drug trafficking and organized crime.

The PKK earns $1.5 billion from drug trafficking annually, said the Turkish National Drug Report for 2018.

Separatist groups ‚Äòtax‚Äô drug trade

In Europe, two types of terrorist groups are distinguished by experts: jihadist terror groups, and ethno-nationalist, separatist terrorist groups. The PKK belongs to the latter, says the report, describing it as ‚Äúa paramilitary group based in the Middle East -- primarily in south-eastern Turkey, northern Syria and northern Iraq.‚Äù

The report also classifies various groups from Northern Ireland as ethno-nationalist, separatist terrorist groups. These organizations are claimed to control or ‚Äútax‚Äù the drug trade, much like the Taliban in Afghanistan. Some can be described ‚Äúhybrid criminal terrorist groups‚Äù for their links to organized criminality.

‚ÄúOrganized crime groups are quick to seize new opportunities for financial gain and are increasingly exploiting technological and logistical innovations to expand their activities across international borders,‚Äù Dimitris Avramopoulos, European commissioner for migration, home affairs and citizenship, said at the presentation of the report in Brussels.

‚ÄúAt the same time, drugs are now more accessible to European consumers, often via social media and the internet. Today‚Äôs report proves once again that the illicit drug market remains a threat to the health and security of our citizens,‚Äù he said, pledging to fight drugs in all its aspects.

4968,"&gt;Ok I understand that you are not a person who are open to civil discussion.

What is it we are doing then?

&gt; You will not accept any logical explanation in favor of Turkey. I simply understand that you want Turks evaporate from earth as you are against everything about them.

How so? Can you point out the sentence in which I implied or stated that I want Turks to evaporate? Why is my desire for survival a threat to your existence?

&gt;My suggestion was creating in a democratic, diverse, safe country but you are against it because Turks would have a state again. 

Is it though? Or do you want us to just all collectively shut up, don't disparage the great Turkish Republic and pray for things to get better until the day we end up like Armenians.

&gt;Iran is a Islamic state with sharia law but sure they are more secular and westerner than us. 

I clearly stated Iranians, not the Islamic Republic of Iran.

&gt; I was also talking about the wars that opened the doors of Anatolia to Turks but you distorted topic by talking about last 100 years. 

Ottoman Empire hosted many different groups of people. It was run by Turks, but it wasn't a ""Turkish nation"" the same way Turkey is. Anatolia losing its cultural fabric and legacy is the result of the last 100 years under the Turkish Republic.

&gt; And lastly, you are implying that you try take whatever forcibly which means both side will hurt unfortunately.

If you were to gather the courage to look outside your political bubble, you would see that one side is currently being hurt and has been hurt by the Turkish state since its creation.

&gt;I really don‚Äôt see that you have a logical suggestion for the situation. 

There is nothing more logical than survival. A lifetime of experience interacting with the average Turkish mentality and recent history has proven to me that Kurdish people will not survive in the long run as long as we live under the boot of Turkish supremacy.

&gt;You just blame me and being aggressive towards me just because I am a Turk.

No. You think I am being aggressive because you have never had your opinions challenged. And you think your ""Turkishness"" has anything to do with my alleged aggression because you are raised to think my identity as a Kurd is somehow a threat to your existence.

&gt;Because I offered to give equal and democratic rights like Kurdish education and Municipal power; did not express anything militarily or oppressive.

Vast majority of the Turkish public is not in favour of giving any sort of democratic rights to Kurds or as a lot of Turkish people have repeatedly told me on reddit, they will not even ""let us breathe"". If you truly hold those views, kuddos to you but you are in the minority.

This has never happened until coup governments and at that period every political party was banned and every minority was opressed. Turkey literally closed local schools and modernized and standardized education pretty recently like in early 80s so your claim is literally impossible.

Our president received the members of the parlement for the usual Christmas greetings. Don't worry they all wear masks and the prime minister was virtually present.

A group of spanish hunters in a spanish owned farm in Portugal hunted 540 animal in one weekend. The dead animals were transported to Portugal.

The internal administration minister is still in charge even after an Ukrainian citizen was killed by emigration authorities at the Lisbon airport in March. Four people were fired but not the minister that believes he is fundamental for the reelection of the president as he said in a press conference. The chief of public security police after a visit to the president explained the changes in the emigration authority, basically that it will be transfer to his police. This was denied by the minister and prime minister, the president didn't comment. At this point we don't know who was lying and everyone is still in their public office.

The vaccines will arrive soon and we are ready according to the health minister that talks every day on national television. We were also told by a health national delegate that if we want to give a jar of jelly in the stairwell of our building, we should do it keeping the social distance in mind.

5043,"THE EUROPEAN: A DAY IN THE LIFE
The European wakes up eager to start his virtuous European day and immediately a thought pops into his head. AMERICANS. This of course is a daily occurrence without fail. ""I wonder what those stupid Americans are up to,"" he thinks as he instinctively opens up his favorite American website Reddit from his iPhone. He scrolls and scrolls seeking an opening to talk about America, anything to latch on to. He's totally not obsessed with Americans. He becomes bored so he turns his TV on and opens up Netflix. He puts on his favorite marvel movie for the billionth time and he goes back to scrolling. He loves engaging in American culture as he bashes America. He's totally not obsessed. He gets hungry and reaches for his iphone to order breakfast from McDonalds using uber eats. ‚ÄúStupid Americans making me eat their shitty food,‚Äù he thinks to himself, ‚ÄúEuropean food is so much better not even close.‚Äù He has eaten KFC 3 out of the last 5 nights for dinner. He waits downstairs for his food so he decides to put on some American rap music. ‚ÄúUgh stupid Americans,‚Äù he says ‚Äútheir culture is such shit! Not like European culture, we have history! and long-standing traditions. True culture comes from the wealthy!‚Äù A Muslim family crosses his path and he pretends to not be afraid and gives them a friendly nod and a wave. ‚ÄúWAAAOOOO‚Äù he thinks as he smirks so self-satisfied ‚ÄúI bet if this was America they would have shot them lol.‚Äù ‚ÄúUs Europeans are much more open-minded and civilized.‚Äù He nods agreeing with himself. His food arrives and makes his way back upstairs as he slurps down the coke Americans have forced him to drink. As he sits down to enjoy his shitty American food his Iphone receives an alert. NEW ZEALAND NOW HAS ZERO CORONAVIRUS CASES! ‚ÄúOh my fucking god!"" He yells! ""I am so gonna rub this in their stupid American faces!‚Äù He tweets, he posts on Instagram. He jumps on Reddit and comments with furor and xenophobia. He never really congratulates New Zealand or their success but instead talks about how Americans will all die from COVID and how they are all so stupid. The European posts charts and graphs he has archived to link when he is questioned. Hes totally not obsessed with America. Dont even joke around like that. Hes cooming with joy. ‚ÄúI really showed those stupid Americans today‚Äù he says to himself ‚Äúthey fucking deserve it, god damn imperialists,‚Äù he says without a shred of irony. Felling extra good about his exploits he decides to go out and enjoy his blessed, virtuous, pretentious Euroday. He laces up his Jordans nice and tight. He puts on his favorite Batman shirt and Nike sweater. As he walks out he grabs a piece of cardboard sitting by the door. The European is now on his way out to protest about something happening in the U.S. Standing in a bus with 300 other people in it he has a thought. Why DO I care so much about things happening in America...Am I obsessed with American life?‚Äù he thinks as he yells Black Lives Matter from his 90% white, European country.",,/r/europe/comments/kj25p8/norwegian_party_leaders_having_a_christmas_debate/ggvlf9k/,NevermindJamba,1608791052

Then you post a link to a UK governmental document (which is interesting, so I'll at least thank you for that) which refers to a report in which it is forecast that if the UK and the EU negotiate a bilateral agreement, there could be a loss of 4.6% to 7.8% of GDP over 15 years compared to remaining within the EU.

These are not one and the same. The figures I have provided are more accurate. You cannot in good faith say that the UK saved/gained (both past tense) ¬£150 billion and then use a predicted figure 15 years from this date to brace your argument.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020748912000028?via%3Dihub

There's been a global shortage of nursing staff for years (decades?) and really, no one thinks it might have something to do with compensation?

I'm in nursing school right now and my brother has an IT company and is involved with hiring personnel. He says if I went into IT at the same education level I'm doing nursing in now, I would make around 40% more than when starting out as a nurse. And that's just the first year. The (yearly) salary increases in IT also far outstrip those in healthcare.

Why this ridiculous difference?

I get that digital infrastructure is incredibly important, but healthcare isn't?

Both sectors are in the same boat:
Chronic shortages of personnel with no end in sight.

Personally I'm definitely considering going the aforementioned contractor route.

As a reminder: It's called a job *market*.

And it's quite clear that at the price we're all willing to pay for nurses there aren't a lot of people selling.

I'm sure someone will chime in at this point though and say I should just get out of healthcare if I'm not a complete martyr and can't just pay off my mortgage with all their generous applause.

5431,"It's worth saying there is a genealogical basis for ""race"". It's just more appropriately suited to academic circles due to the controversy and misappropriation around the topic. It's more about genetic clustering and understanding divergence through human history/migration than predicting any characteristics like school ability. It's main practical relevance is within epidemiological contexts where disease and drug risks may not be the same for people within different genetic clusters. It has been found that surprisingly enough, self-reporting ties very closely to people's genetic clustering, so it's a good enough proxy for every day purposes. e.g. mothers who self identify as African or Caribbean in the UK may be asked if they would like their children tested for sickle-cell disease because they're more at risk.

5436,"First of all, I only partially blamed the turks for balkan wars. Turks actually do not get the treatment of the other colonial empires like British and French which are perennially blamed for every misdoing in the territories they once possessed.


But the most important point I am tryin to get across is that: You were the one that tried to downplay ottoman atrocities under the banner that it might not be considered colonial. Given that there is no clear definition, I think your attempt to minimize my point on the basis of semantics is faulty.

The argument around white dominions is that they served as a demand vectors, where excess home production especially in energy(coal) and manufactures could be dumped. Hence, this colonies acted in completely different accord to what you describe in India for example. 

This is much more in line with how things operated in Ottoman empire, but that does not mean that Ottoman empire was not colonial.

I'm not from France but as far as I can see they are the first country of the EU to reopen the border for supplies. If French business would know that their supplies are being held at the border because of some game they will be outraged and heading straight up to Paris. Remember the yellow vest protests?

Politicians do play games and the clich√© of the corruption of power is very much true, but if France is stopping supplies that other countries can deliver instead, they will lose out on quite a lot of money. The Netherlands would be first in line to deliver if France would not. 

We have a very dark past in trade (VOC) and even our prime minister in 2006 was making comments to rekindle that spirit. Trade will always find a way, in some cases to devastating effects.
