You are right about US meddling in the politics of other countries. But do I need to list all the colonies and associated atrocities during Europe‚Äôs imperialistic rule?? Come on now, be objective not subjective.

NATO has placed defensive military positions along eastern Europe since 2000. Examples below

Yes I‚Äôm aware that about 25 million Russians were killed during WWll. But did you also know that it was American industry that taught Stalin to build his military

Do you know why 25 million Russians died? Because they were forced to charge the Nazi‚Äôs without weapons until Russians could take equipment from Germans. And if they refused to charge, Soviets killed them. 

And you mention Russia liberating Europe only to occupy eastern Europe postwar. And impose communism. Seems shortsighted.

Looking at a map of Europe. What countries did Russia liberate in Europe? Russia invaded Poland at the start of the war. So that‚Äôs not liberating. And Berlin is several hundred kilometers from the border of Poland. Doesn‚Äôt seem like Russia went far into central/western Europe.

Also, 27 million Chinese died too. Many as horrific as the Jews.

I can understand that Eastern Countries want NATO and that the above threat is a cheap one, since many same American users often rush to justify that it's ""all hyperbole, they'll never abandon the East"", and it's true even for an independent EU there will need to be military spending.

My point however is that it's not about spending anymore, but about the US acting on their own and repeatedly flip-flopping on their commitments **I would trust the Germans to hold to an agreement they signed than the Americans**.
The problem is that even with spending handled the problem with unilateral action remains. Spending is not the issue at the heart of the issues in NATO, politics is.

483,"Thanks again for this great response, it definitely shows a side of him that I was unaware of (especially him being ""friendly"" with Mahathir) and I appreciate you taking the time to write this. I guess I did not realise how political he was indeed.

I haven't much more to say regarding PJ Thum however I'd like to discuss more, if you allow me, on the idea  that Singapore politic is ""centrist"" and thus the idea that it takes carefully thought decisions rather than out of partisanship. It is also an argument that we hear a lot in the west these days (centrists are the new cool, often like to depicts themselves as people who are beyond politic and act more like cool-headed professional). As a disclaimer I'd like to point out that I do see myself as a centrist but I am also aware that in order to judge the net value of a political decision it really depends on what you prioritise. Given an issue, doing the right thing may vary a lot depending on wether you are a leftist, conservative, a liberal, a nativist or all the other color of the spectrum. 

I think what is distinctive about PAP is that it values stability above everything else and I am sure it is a value shared by most of singaporean (enough that I don't think PAP today is forcing abusively its intellectual dominance in the political arena). But for instance if you take an issue like 377A, was keeping it the right thing to do? I suppose it is when one value stability above progressive politic but it was not as clearcut was it? I am actually glad that there was a lot of discussion in this topic (and there actually still is). Again please understand that I am not arguing for or against repelling this section nor do I judge the government decision on the matter, I am just pointing out that in politic, there are no such thing as the right thing but often it is a careful balance of power and truth is that in Singapore, PAP holds most of it. So though it is true that all the political player in Singapore are pretty much all different flavour of centrist, this apparent ""like-mindedness"" may also be explained by a rather iron fist stance against those thinking too far from the ""party line"" if you allow me the expression, akin to a survivorship bias situation. 

Even Pritam Singh himself admit this in his [Secretary General's speech 2019](http://www.wp.sg/members-forum-2019-secretary-generals-speech-one-wp/):

&gt; as a medium term objective, the Workers‚Äô Party should aim to contest and win 1/3 of the seats in Parliament. [..] The political outcome that is desired is one which makes any Government sensitive to the pulse of the people and their welfare, allowing any ruling party to govern without gridlock while promoting the political openness that so many of us yearn for in Singapore. It will engender a different type of politics that precipitates a Singapore which is caring and confident about the future, **not one that is framed by libel suit after libel suit against one‚Äôs opponents, be they in politics or civil society**.

&gt; **Never forget that the playing field between the PAP and opposition will continue to be uneven given the PAP‚Äôs determination to maintain its dominance through its control of grassroots organisations. This includes its ability to make changes to the Constitution, the highest law of the land, through its near absolute control of Parliament.**

I think PJ Thum is indeed too far from what is accepted here, not just by PAP but also by the people, he is provocative and strikes as someone who does fall out of line and thinking about it, it finally comes to me as no surprise really that he would have to find support outside of Singapore, be it economic or political. Is it a good thing or a bad thing for Singapore I guess only the future will tell, who am I to judge :-)",France,/r/europe/comments/dzlnth/the_eusingapore_free_trade_agreementipa_enters/f8hc9q6/,zabadap,1574572513

Yes especially the automobil Industry went to Eastern Neighbours.  Do you even fact check anything you say? Also that must make France and UK and many other European countries much worse.

613,"&gt;why do vetos by ceremonial figures even need to exist?

Because our monarch isn't a ceremonial figure, or at least wasn't until our current Queen. This notion of ceremonialism is a totally modern perspective, it's not what the monarchy was about for most of its existence.

Remember, our monarch is also the head of the Church of England. They're literally meant to have been chosen by God to protect the faith. Their authority comes from God. They are effectively our Pope, owing from King Henry VIII's exiting us from the Catholic church. Asking why they have power is questioning God's judgement.

I'm not fucking with you, [see the Thirty-nine Articles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-nine_Articles):

It's actually an interesting topic. Huawei is on paper owned by their ""labour union"", that is true, but in reality it isn't. On paper Huawei is owned 99% by the union and 1% by Ren Zhengfei, but the union shares have no proportional voting rights, it just gives a Chinese employee the right to own a ""virtual share"" of the company. They cannot be traded and if you leave the company you lose all your employee stock, so in reality, it's just a nice name for a bonus system. So at best it's a brilliant accounting exercise, but also a good example of why we need transparent accounting standards.

Besides. Put yourself in the shoes of the people who lived back then.
Who would you rather join with?
The Germans who conquered France or the Soviets who failed to conquer Finland?

My problem is not in a lack of understanding for how Romanians could talk themselves into joining the Axis, it's how one joins the Axis and imagines that the countries you were at war with still bear some sort of obligation or debt to you for it. There are choices and consequences, and the consequence to the choice of allying with the Nazis is that relations get frostier with the folks who are at war with them.

&gt; That was just Antonescu. The majority of the country wanted to stop at just Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. And even if Antonescu wasn't in charge. It's not like we could have told Hitler

Romania mustered more men for the project of invading deep into the USSR than all the other Nazi allies combined, a larger military than the USA had at the start of the war. If hardly anyone was for going further, why was Antonescu able to get and sustain this support instead of being promptly assassinated like the other bucketfuls of Romanian leaders at the time who did stuff that wasn't liked? Hungary was in atrocity Olympics with Romania to see who would get to keep Transylvania with daddy Hitler's approval, but ex.

Well, when you talk about impossible situations, consider that [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Unthinkable#/media/File:Allied_army_positions_on_10_May_1945.png) is what the situation was like on the ground in Europe. Meanwhile the western allies are fighting a war on the opposite side of the planet, one which for the US was the actual driving reason to be in the war for the populace as a whole. Why would they then declare war on the USSR in the middle of it so that the whole of western Europe outside of the British isles is left to crumple before the millions strong Red Army?

We didn't protect Poland but I don't begrudge them the talk about how the British pledged their word to save them, since they did actually have a treaty in place and were friendly relations. This is why I decided to comment on a Romanian person whining about how the British didn't save them instead of one of the Polish people

Yes, and that's why Hungary joined in too because they were thinking oh shoot when Romania invaded the USSR with Germany and really wanted Hitler to still back them up. Actually I've read that this is a part of why Stalin reassigned Transylvania to Romania, he figured that the Romanians waging war on the USSR at least made sense what with the occupation of their former northeastern territories but that the Hungarians doing so was something that they ought to be punished for because it was for currying Hitler's favor.",Mississippi,/r/europe/comments/dyihyx/ww2_romanian_propaganda_cartoon_depicting_winston/f8foeqo/,sparkling_uranium,1574547257

798,"I will add that there are things that I *do* agree with him on.  For example, it looks like he's in the the right-libertarian ""open-borders are good"" camp, and he's got a video arguing that mass Syrian immigration is very good for Germany -- and, frankly, I agree with him.  (Yeah, it *could* end badly if handled poorly, but I see considerably more upside potential than downside.)

He makes the point that China is hugely-limiting herself by acting in a way that is very, very unpopular with all the countries in her neighborhood -- she's big, but she's also creating huge obstacles for herself.

But he's got a lot of stuff that I really do not agree with.

He's got a persistent thread through his videos of *really spazzing out* about the British Empire.

He's wants to [extend control in Eastern Europe to Russia in the hopes of obtaining a deep and friendly relationship with Russia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OrowDSkaUA&amp;feature=youtu.be), which I frankly don't consider to be all that important and where I think that he rather ignores the costs of that.

He seems to equate influence with empire -- and while it's true that there are ways in which great control can be exerted in a non-formal manner, I think that he also tends to take rather extreme interpretation of any influence at all.

He treats the fact that the US advocates for strong IP rights -- something which is at least short-term advantageous to the US, as the US *owns* and *creates* a lot of IP -- as imperial and exploitative.  I think that there's a fair argument that it'd be more-efficient to have shorter time limits on IP, but this is hardly something other than which *every* country aims for -- *it* desires to have favorable terms for things that it likes.  The EU advocates for PDO protection, for example.  Agree with it or not, it hardly seems that granting exclusive rights over ""champagne"" or ""feta"" or having a long period of copyright is some sort of structure to continuously drain wealth out of countries.

He subscribes to a concept of the ""deep state"" and thinks that the CIA and State Department are acting against US interests, that it is corrupt ties to businesses that profit in some way that drive their positions, and that he is free of such corruption and so can see clearly.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/e0mlj3/european_empire_is_a_myth_avoiding_the_british/f8fqu6z/,duisThias,1574548139

810,"&gt;And you're saying that the US really wants to run a trade imbalance with the EU

Not at all. Read my comment again.

&gt;Rather, it is comparative advantage

Theory is fine. But that is not the case in our reality. Market is profitable for all only if it is based on equitable and impartial rules. Ignoring the different local situation between Europe and USA, as exemplified in the tax difference, the US controlls the currency in which trade is being made. Any trade imbalances can easily be equalised by printing money out of thin air. European countries on the other side have to produce the value. This has been the case for entire post ww2 history. The way federal reserve p pegs the dollar depends greatly on the political agreement with foreign partners which means an obvious blackmailing tool. Europeans are easily fooled because Europe had it better than the rest of the world. Basically better in having less political interventionalism and more freedom, while the US still live at our expense.

Regardles of this, trade balance is only important for production heavy economies, like Japan and Germany. Singapore, UK and US earn significant income from other activites, like financial or IT-services and exploitation of former colonies (UK) or new puppets (US). Most European countries don't exercise their political power to abuse third world and would have to stand in competition with the US?

Economic activity is only one of many in a society. Areas, such as art, education and attributes of the quality of life should not be exposed to market forces. This is often hard for Americans to understand, since business dominates your life. Perhaps our system would be better giving a bit more encouragement for new business ideas but we would obviously not want to open our society to companies without the mentioned considerations. I prefer the subsidised French farmer with modest yields of first class food to cheap American genetically modified nutrition.

As you can see from the things you wrote, like most contemporary economists, you make some poorly substantiated assumptions about the reality and intentions of market actors. The aim of big US businesses is *not* to fairly participate at the market within the scope of their economic activity, seeking to sell their product as best as they can. Their aim is precisely the opposite of a market. The domination of customers and destruction of competition, i.e. abolition of market freedoms and variability. Neither is their aim to produce the best possible product. Small businesses with honest intentions are not protected and they are forced to either employ the same tactics or end their enterprise.",,/r/europe/comments/dzlnth/the_eusingapore_free_trade_agreementipa_enters/f8f740r/,delete013,1574539235

Most car owners in cities choose to own a car, even when it's not necessary. I live in an extremely walkable neighborhood with good access to public transport, proximity to all services people need regularly, and plenty of workplaces. And even if your workplace is in the other part of the city, there's often an option to move to a similar residential district that's closer to it. Cars are very optional here. 

And yet, every bit of road is absolutely packed with cars here. Car owners constantly complain about not being able to find a parking spot. This neighborhood was built to be walkable, and with an assumption of way lower car ownership.

967,"&gt; Again, convert doesn't mean 'd√∂nme', but that's used for a specific group. You're confusing iptidai and iptida with d√∂nme. I strongly suggest you to go and read the terminology. If you don't know anything about the terminology, then please don't use it.

I'm not confusing anything. You are. Convert means donme. While the ""donmeh"" is used for Sabatayist Jews in Turkey, the correct translation of ""donme"" to English is ""convert"", meaning one who has converted (donme), got that? Or do you need lessons in English?   
   
&gt;Otherwise you're also claiming all Turks and Bosniaks, Albanians and such are also d√∂nmes. I mean, think a bit before claiming stuff.    
   
No, I'm talking about convert Jews (Sabetayist donme community). But Bosnians (not Bosniak), Albanians, Bulgarians and Georgians of the city are also converts to Islam. There are barely any Turkmens left in Salonica by the 19th century, most of them were either murdered or forced to flee (most of them by Sultan Mehmet II and some by Yavuz). Salonica is mostly a Jewish city (Jews and convert Jews, the donme, and then there are Albanians, Bosnians, Bulgarians and some Turkmens.   
   
Mustafa Kemal's family lived in the quarter of donmes (Sabetayist Jews who, centuries ago, converted to Islam) and he studied under ≈ûemsi Efendi, the leading donme teacher who founded a school for the donmes (convert Jews) of Salonica to attend to and later founded Isik and Terakki schools.  
   
The population exchange between Greece and Turkey after the war was not made between Turks and Greeks but between Ottoman Muslims and Orthodox Rum (who's never set foot in Greece in their lives and didn't even speak Greek but forced to leave their country and move to Greece where they were called ""Turkish semen""). Turkish history books changed this story by telling the exchange was made between Turks and Greeks, and that all the people who came from Salonica and Greece ""Turks"" due to nationalist policies of the new republic which was founded on Turkish nationalism by calling all muslim population of the empire ""Turks"".",Earth,/r/europe/comments/du81hi/turkey_mourning_her_founders_death_today/f8es7fi/,zonaldefense,1574532800

1080,"&gt;However, one shall not present it as relevant data because it is not.

Yeah, but the people love the charts and the catchy headlines so politicians hand them out like candy.

&gt; As for the buses, it is only about that after 2022, the government will only support the purchase of electric buses. 

I think that's exactly what I said? Euro 6 only between 2020 and 2022 and then electric only. Sure buses service for 20+ years, so the closest we're going to see a visible result will be around 2035 and even if nothing goes wrong (but it will), the total absence of ICEs won't happen before 2040-2045. 

&gt; So the reversal seems to me as a politically motivated decision, rather than one based on facts. 

Hungarian politics is stuck in the 'help me and I'll help you' philosophy of the soviet era. I don't know when will they shed this approach, it clearly doesn't work.

&gt; Furthermore, I should add that the EU targets are relevant for the Eu as a whole, and not for individual countries. 

That's something I haven't realised, and is a deciding argument.

&gt; Uhmm, no. See [this](https://www.mnnsz.hu/igy-szaladtak-el-az-evek-magyarorszag-mellett-amig-a-vilagban-forradalom-indult/) article. 

You're right, Hungary agreed to decrease its emission by 20% compared to 1990, that's what I remembered. The 2030 date you mentioned is the correct one in the context.

&gt; P.S.: It is not hard for solar energy production to tenfold when it has been abysmal for years. 

Yeah, there are 2 popes per km^(2) in the Vatican. Statistics serve a political narrative. I can't find official statistics for gross energy consumption newer than 2017. I know Hungary's been boosting their stats for at least a year now, solar farms are popping up everywhere. 

&gt; Why didn't France veto that? or basically any other Western European country? 

[Check this document](https://www.ecologic.eu/sites/files/publication/2018/3550-eu_2050_strategic_vision_a_clean_planet_for_all.pdf) On page 3, Power sector paragraph. The goal is to reach carbon neutrality with almost wholly renewables. 81-85% was the original goal. The new nuclear reactor blocks will provide at least 30% of the needs of the country. France currently has a share of 75% in nuclear, but unlike Hungary, they're already planning to reduce this to 50% by 2035. France is a large country with multiple nuclear power plants, they can play with capacities more freely.

Currently Hungary imports 30-35% of its energy. Our only nuclear reactor block is going to be shut down by 2035 because it's too old. We will have to shut down all our fossil power plants by the emission agreements, so if we don't build the new blocks, we won't have a power baseline. But if we build it, we can't reach the 81-85% renewable goal. If we build it, and then run it at 50% capacity not only will it be a financial loss, we will still be importing when renewables under-produce. Nuclear power plants can't be quickly reconfigured based on daily needs.

If you think about it, try to list the EU countries that have no mountains, no shores, but are surrounded by high mountain ranges. In Hungary, wind is negligible, sunny hours are below average, rivers are slow and flat, and no shores anywhere. Yet Hungary is still building solar and wind parks, the only hurdle is the percent of nuclear in the 2050 strategy scenarios. We have two choices, accept that we're sacrificed for the greater good of Europe and pay a shitton of money every year for energy imports, or demand a solution that fits all EU countries, not just the most of them. Some parties would choose the former, the current government chooses the latter.",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/dzjien/hungary_and_the_climate_change_since_1990_energy/f8e3r1h/,Nerevaryne,1574517858
1144,"&gt; and the roads won't get congested because all the Johnny Cabs will be routed by a central system

Roads operate as a network, and in fact, the modeling techniques traffic planners use are very similar to the techniques that *digital* networks use. Cars are packets. Roads are routes. In a digital network, like the Internet, packets are just data *and congestion is still a problem*.

It doesn't matter how smart your routing system is, there is a maximum capacity your network can support. This is a reason, for example, on a digital network, we might use different packet sizes- if we care about latency, we use small packets, if we care about throughput we use large packets (cars vs. buses). The key difference with a city is that people also *live there*, so we want to prioritize the space around those people (sometimes called ""pedestrians"") who don't fit neatly in this packet analogy, but really should be viewed as the fundamental unit of urban planning.",,/r/europe/comments/e0fj7l/how_much_public_space_weve_surrendered_to_cars/f8e3r8e/,remy_porter,1574517862

1227,"&gt;They totally not confiscated food products from peasant, accepted foreign assistance, not isolate starved people through administrative, legislative and repressive measures.

This seems to be untrue, at least when applied to the famine of 1932. As Mark Tauger writes: 

""In 1932, a Soviet decree reintroduced some free-market policies in the agricultural realm and lowered grain procurement quotas, leading some to term this 'a new NEP.' The reduction of the procurement quota for 1932 and the return of procured grain to the villages are inconsistent with the famine. Considerably more grain should have been left for the peasants after the procurement from the 1932 harvest than what was left from those of 1931, 1933 or 1934. Yet no famine occurred in 1933 or 1934.""

Mark Tauger, The 1932 Harvest and the Famine of 1933, p. 72-73

As Davies and Wheatcroft make out the reasons for the famine in *Years of Hunger*, they note a) considerable draught and crop failure b) Kulak sabotage c) overextension of arable land and d) local mismanagement.

1231,"I dobry think it will ever be for Poland. I am Polish and Polish people have a completely different mentality than central / western Europe. It's hard to explain but while most European countries lean a bit more towards 'how this will benefit us all' (yes, even Italy and UK) Polish people's thinking is extremely 'how it will benefit me' and 'dont tell me what to do'. Polish younger generation is very European but millennial like me and older are just generally selfish and closed minded. Of course you'll get those few progressive dudes, they most likely are here on Reddit, but on general not really.

 Poland will never lose coal, certainly not in 10 years. It's a huge industry here and losing coal will create a lot of discontent for nothing. While Poles believe in climate change they don't care enough to support the government that wants to invest in green, and definitely don't care enough to all the big coal industry to be closed.

I come from a city where you don't really finish secondary school because there's a mine that pays well. Young guys know that they will be hired as miners straight away (and are) allowing them to earn quite a lot of money and retire when they're mid 40s with a good pension. On a miner salary you can get a mortgage and support your family. There's no party willing to that away and create a lot of unemployment. O hate to say that but most of those guys are completely unemployable, it is already hard to get a restaurant job even if you have a degree.

**TLDR**: Poland won't get rid of coal, it will create too much unemployment and Polish people don't care about the climate change",UK,/r/europe/comments/e0203b/coal_phaseout_plan_of_eu/f8dv5fb/,Blonde_Calculator,1574510570

1236,"Many people predict that we will get much of that space back in the comming decades.

Driverless vehicles are coming sooner or later and they will free up a lot of parking spaces in the city.

Autonomous cars won't need to park in front of wherever you are going, they will briefly stop to let you out and then park themselves in some nearby, but out of the way parking lot or structure to recharge.

This will free up a lot of space, especially in the old narrow streets you find in most European cities where parked cars take up a large amount of space.

Even better autonomous cars won't have to drive aggressively. Especially when they don't have an passengers they can just let whatever humans are 'jaywalking' across the road go first. And it doesn't take much of artificial intelligence to be a better and more careful driver than natural (un-)intelligent humans.

The roads will become a lot less dangerous to humans that way.

And that is only the beginning. If there are enough autonomous cars and they are all talking to each other and knowing how everyone of them will react they can coordinate the traffic flow much better, allowing for a better throughput of the same volume of cars in the city at much greater average speed without needing to drive at unsafe max speeds. No more rush-hour traffic jams.

If ride sharing of autonomous vehicles takes of the way everyone seems to think it might. Cars will be less of the personal home on wheels they are now and more like public transport or horizontally moving elevator cars. They will be infrastructure not status symbols and be downgraded a lot in priority compared to pedestrians in urban design.

By 2030 the way we see the streets in our cities today may be little more than a bad memory.

Instead of places reserved for personal vehicles it will be places for people where occasionally robot-taxis containing passengers with Uber/Amazon/Tesla/Google subscriptions are ferried around to their destination. 

More room for people and greenery and less danger and pollution.

Certainly not. The Finnish government was to avoid offending the Soviet Union in any way. Alakulppi acted without the support of the Finnish government. He didn't even live in Finland, he'd been forced to leave the country in 1945 because of the Weapons Cache Case. You see, some Finnish officers conducted a secret a secret and officially unsanctioned military operation, which aimed to create weapon caches across the country. If the Soviet Union decided to occupy Finland, the weapons could be used for resistance. A total of 5,000‚Äì10,000 people participated in the operation. Then the Soviet-controlled intelligence services found out about it, and arrested a bunch of people. Alakulppi was among the suspects. To avoid prison he emigrated to the United States and joined the U.S. army. That's where he prepared his case against the Soviet Union.  





At the time the Finnish intelligence services were controlled by communists who had close relations to the Soviet Union.

1554,"&gt; Because any treaty signed in time of war could change when peace treaty is signed.

As best I can tell from looking online, it's generally-considered that the state of war was terminated:

[Have Germany and Poland ever signed a peace treaty after WWII?](https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/9644/have-germany-and-poland-ever-signed-a-peace-treaty-after-wwii)

&gt; Yes they did. The Treaty of Good Neighbourship and Friendly Cooperation qualifies as a ""peace treaty""; see preamble and article 1 of the Polish text of the treaty. The treaty was signed in 1991 and went into force on 16 January 1992. It did not say specifically ""we have had a war until today, but since tomorrow we are at peace"", but it would hardly make sense in context of Article II of the treaty of 1970 ""will solve all their disputes exclusively by peaceful means"" and ""will restrain from the threat of violence or the use of violence"". Generally in the diplomatic practice, signing a peace treaty does not require the parties to be at war at the moment of signing; countries can sign a peace treaty even if they are already at peace.
&gt;
&gt;The border has been also formally settled (""border treaty"" as opposed to ""peace treaty"" if you seek such contrast), as described in the update of Wladimir Palant's answer here.

But, hey.  Let's suppose that it isn't.  Germany doesn't get any form of legal advantage in asking Poland to change its borders again because the two happen to be at war.  The two could be at peace or at war and either way, Germany can show up with a treaty and Poland could sign it.

And let me even go another step further -- even if Germany *did* get some form of legal benefit from being at war, Germany could declare war any time she wants anyway and could get that benefit anyway.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/e03s57/poland_outraged_at_memorial_stone_for_freikorps/f8djcy7/,duisThias,1574493600

1632,"&gt;They are the same ethnicity as the Bosnian serb minority, yes. Who has an elderly declining population. Correct.

A pattern seen throughout all of Europe. Sheesh.

&gt;The Bosnian church was a very important factor of the country's history, you either don't know or don't care about being honest if you're trying to downplay it. Crusades from Catholic powers happened over it.

Two incursions by Hungarians, whose goal was really to conquer Bosnia. I don't know what makes Hungary *Catholic powers*.

&gt;And it did leave a lasting legacy up until the Ottoman occupation, the Bosnian church followers were the only ones to convert to islam in mass because without the Bosnian state they had no authority to rely to protect them, to hold onto their land on unlike Catholics with basically entire Europe around them.

There is zero factual proof to support this claim. It's simply what Bosniaks want to be true.

&gt;And besides, Serb national identity is based on Orthodoxy and the Orthodox church, to (wrongly) say this was just a Catholic country before the Ottomans also goes against your narrative.

You could surely say that today, but that doesn't mean it was always the case. To this day, pockets of Muslim and Catholic Serbs exist, while most have been assimilated. You can google muslim Serbs or check out *Pilipenda* by Simo Matavulj. Great piece of literature that survives to tell the tale of how the Serbian populace of Dalmatia was Catholicized.

&gt;Why did that not happen a moment before he tried to take over the collapsing Serbian state? Really makes you think.

Really makes you think how he was King of Serbs after conquering 1/5th of Serbian land, while he was never King of Bosniaks.

&gt;there's a repeated pattern of Serbs using this mentally retarded logic in claiming other peoples as Serbs, and having no one take them seriously.

Not really. The Bosniak population was always treated as Serb or Croats. Check out DAI from the 10th century, or censuses from the 19th century, most of them refer to Bosniaks as Serbs or Croats.

As for Croats: there are Catholicized Serbs among them, chiefly in Dalmatia. It's not made up, you just couldn't bother doing the research.

Serbs don't claim Macedonians are pure Serbs, sorry. They are more Bulgarian than Serb, but they were certainly somewhere inbetween. Serbia tried to assume control of the region but failed in the end.

Also on the whole Serbian tribe thing you ranted about, it's true. How is it a fairy tale when a 10th century document like DAI literally talks about Croats and Serbs? We also know that the Serbian migrations are true because of the Sorbs in eastern Germany, who call themselves ""Serby"" in their language. The exact same endonym as the Serbs living in the Balkans. How can we be so sure? Well, we can because the Serbian endonym is not of Indo-European origin and therefore we can essentially conclude they have the same source.

""The ethnonym ""Sorbs"" (Serbja, Serby) derives from the medieval ethnic groups called Sorbs (Surbi, Sorabi). The original ethnonym, Srbi, was retained by the Sorbs and Serbs in the Balkans.[6] By the 6th century, Slavs occupied the area west of the Oder formerly inhabited by Germanic peoples.[6] The Sorbs are first mentioned in the 7th century. In their languages, the other Slavs call them the ""Lusatian Serbs"", and the Sorbs call the Serbs ""the south Sorbs"".""

Furthermore, we have another source in the Royal Frankish Annals, describing how *prince Ljudevit went from his seat at Sisak to the Serbs*. The position hasn't been pinpointed yet, but it's considered to have been in western Bosnia. Kind of crazy how DAI and the RFA both imply Serbs lived east of the Cetina river.

&gt;The Bosnian christians of the Bosnian Church in the independent Bosnian Kingdom called themselves dobri Bosnjani, so you can talk about the exact term, even though Bosniak also has centuries of history, but it clearly won't end up in your favor.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/dzyax5/the_average_age_of_people_in_bosnia_and/f8dbwg0/,MRCNSRRVLTNG,1574484797

the commitment by the United Kingdom to act in a constructive and responsible manner

I‚Äôd also say that the preposition can often be omitted when the relationship between the objects of a sentence is already clear.

Also, WTF about those triggered poles... It's a common practice in science to indicate the country where the research and the discovery are made. Who cares about the ethnicity or the origins of the discoverer? Nationalists who don't care about the history of science, but just about how many medals they can have on their flags.

This data is only interesting because it shows how a handful of countries made the discoveries, which indicates that it required a specific scientific culture but also special installations. Which tends to concentrate discoveries and scientists in a few different places, which is a problem because diversity of approaches is a big asset when it comes to science. I wish we had more flags on this table. I hope future discoveries will be shared by more countries.

No, like 'getting basic stuff done that was supposed to be done ages ago'.

Here's a recent example: From 1 January 2020, *every* German shop, no matter the size, even the smallest kiosk at the Christmas markets, have to print out paper receipts if a customer pays non-cash, even if it's just twenty cents for a bread roll at the baker's.

Why? Because the ministry of finance wants to crack down on money laundering and tax evasion, and because no-one ever ever came up with a digital solution for it. So in the third decade of the 21^st century, Germans still leave a paper trails whenever they buy something. 

Of take broadband infrastructure, for instance. The federal government had put several billions of infrastructure subsidies in a fund, to be withdrawn by states and cities whenever they want to built up net infrastructure. But nobody knows what to do with the money because nobody has a plan, so the funds aren't withdrawn and the money is rotting away in the pot as we speak ...

You know, when I took my first job at an investment bank 15 years ago, one of the first things I heard from my supervisor was ""*if I ever find a piece of paper when you leave the office, you're out*"" - because modern corporate communication is supposed to be done electronically and not like we're still in the 19^th century.",Charlemagnia - personally vouching for /u/-ah,/r/europe/comments/e03t2j/germanys_krampkarrenbauer_calls_to_set_up_digital/f8cgy5s/,ColourFox,1574460002

1906,"&gt; The fall of the 1st phase of the EU can be attributed largely to the rival alliance systems - Multi-Speed Europe These rival alliances threatened the underlying nature of the European Union. The creation of the Visgrad group is one of them and the other the G6/) 

I'm reasonably sure that pretty much every system of government develops ""factions"" that glom together to achieve specific goals.  Could be formal parties, whatever, but as long as interests exist and combined efforts can advance those interests more-effectively than individual members can, I suspect that one will see such alliances.

Back when the US was getting going, the creation of political parties, which were forming up along geographical lines, was one of the things that really worried Washington -- he was pretty sure that political parties would be a complete disaster and tear things apart.

https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Washington%27s_Farewell_Address

&gt; In contemplating the causes, which may disturb our Union, it occurs as matter of serious concern, that any ground should have been furnished for characterizing parties by Geographical discriminations, Northern and Southern, Atlantic and Western; whence designing men may endeavour to excite a belief, that there is a real difference of local interests and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence, within particular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts. You cannot shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heart-burnings, which spring from these misrepresentations; they tend to render alien to each other those, who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have lately had a useful lesson on this head; they have seen, in the negotiation by the Executive, and in the unanimous ratification by the Senate, of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at that event, throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded were the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the General Government and in the Atlantic States unfriendly to their interests in regard to the Mississippi; they have been witnesses to the formation of two treaties, that with Great Britain, and that with Spain, which secure to them every thing they could desire, in respect to our foreign relations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their wisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the union by which they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those advisers, if such there are, who would sever them from their brethren, and connect them with aliens?
&gt;
&gt; To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a Government for the whole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts can be an adequate substitute; they must inevitably experience the infractions and interruptions, which all alliances in all times have experienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon your first essay, by the adoption of a Constitution of Government better calculated than your former for an intimate Union, and for the efficacious management of your common concerns. This Government, the offspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full investigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its principles, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with energy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, has a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are duties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true Liberty. The basis of our political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter their Constitutions of Government. But the Constitution which at any time exists, till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish Government presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the established Government.
&gt;
&gt; All obstructions to the execution of the Laws, all combinations and associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put, in the place of the delegated will of the nation, the will of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public administration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans digested by common counsels, and modified by mutual interests.

In this situation so would we. I don't see the obstacle.

Not really, our lives wouldn't be any different in Budapest or Vienna just because the navy patrols the sea and part of the (hopefully by that time) common EU army is deployed on the outer border of Greece/Bulgaria. Which is kind of the point.

2115," 

&gt;A member of the audience on last  night's Question Time on BBC One criticised Labour's policy of raising  income taxes for people earning over ¬£80,000 on the grounds that it  wouldn't be enough to put them in the top 5% of earners.  
&gt;  
&gt;""I am nowhere near in the top 5%, let me tell you, I'm not even in the top 50%,"" he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Presenter  Fiona Bruce said Labour, ""would raise income tax on those earning over  ¬£80,000. You're saying that would affect you because you earn over that  sum?"" The man confirmed he did.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;HMRC publishes tables each year breaking down income taxpayers into 100 equally-sized groups based on how much they earn.  
&gt;  
&gt;The most recent figures, for 2016-17, show that you needed to be earning ¬£75,300 to be in the top 5%.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you adjust that using average earnings figures from the ONS, it's likely that you need to be earning about ¬£81,000 to be in the top 5% of income taxpayers today.  
&gt;  
&gt;But  the figures from HMRC exclude people earning too little to pay income  tax, which means that the audience member would have been well into the  top 5% of all earners.  
&gt;  
&gt;He's certainly not outside the top 50% - anything over about ¬£25,000 would put him in the top half.",,/r/europe/comments/e04m6j/does_80000_put_you_in_the_top_5_of_earners/f8bunzb/,yolo4everlmi,1574445728

2118,"1.) I do not mean to be harsh, but that alone does not prove anything. The power was shared between a Presidency and the Presidents of the Republics. Out of six republics, two were Serb - Montenegro and Serbia. 

2.)They did not plan the war - as you can see by reading the transcripts of the talks in the presidency, Milosevic and Bulatovic were almost categorically against conflict. Izetbegovic too, but he did arm people and form paramilitaries in the background. 

3.) It was called Yugoslavia, Federative Republic of Yugoslavia. This was the official name. Later changed to Serbia and Montenegro, around 2002. 

4.) This is not true. First of all you need to know that the constitution in power at the time was the one proclaimed in 1946 - but rather a new one from 1974... However, both of these constitutions named the nations as the carriers of sovereignity and not the states - which means that only nations as such could exercise that right - and not republics! This means that Croats had a right, not FR Croatia, this also means that Serbs had the right! Read the first paragraph of the constitution.

2180,"That's a beautiful quote. It was however written in 1912. Before the major events thats shaped the modern Polish state.

The current wave of Polish nationalism has reimagined the glory days as an ethically 'pure', ultra Catholic, homogeneous state. In truth, the first Polish Republic, in its golden age, was a religiously and culturally tolerant country. It never criminalised homosexuality, the only country in Europe to hold that title. It also had freedom of religion, and was generally far ahead of its time in the 16th century. These and similar ideals are the ones Sienkiewicz was writing to defend. But this was before the apocalyptic attacks by the German fascists and Russian communists. The Germans executed en mass the Polish ruling class. They were eliminated such that they cannot simply be replaced (see: intelligenzaktion), these were the people who understood and upheld the values of the first Republic. The Soviets then proceeded to complete the Nazi atrocities, by further murdering and deporting the remaining intellectuals.

That was what happened. So here we are, Poland is finally free. And in a cruel twist of fate, the powers that be have decided to impose sameness on the present population. Everyone must be Catholic. Children must be taught medieval propaganda at shool. Minorities are scapegoated. Yesterday it was refugees. Today it is homosexuals. This is not fascism, but it is close. It is far from the truth of Poland's roots, it may even be completely opposite to them. But the lie has been told, and it has been accepted, by more than half of the population.

2244,"&gt; It's the maximum amount that a household can afford to consume without having to reduce its assets or to increase its liabilities. It's obtained adding to people‚Äôs gross income (earnings, self-employment and capital income, as well as current monetary transfers received from other sectors) the social transfers in-kind that households receive from governments (such as education and health care services), and then subtracting the taxes on income and wealth, the social security contributions paid by households as well as the depreciation of capital goods consumed by households. Available data refer to the sum of households and non-profit institution serving households.

That's the OECD description of the measurement.  Finding a detailed breakdown of what specific benefits recieved/paid are being counted is... tough.

2265,"Well, I was born in a rustbelt town in Indiana, though one with a university, so not super safe, but not Detroit or Chicago levels of crime. Than lived in LA and in Mobile, Alabama in the States. Than my work through me to Europe, Amsterdam, Munich, Vienna, Warsaw. At least (6 months in each place) and for me the safety issue is very very visible. Even in Warsaw, the biggest which I‚Äôve lived in in Europe, I can walk any district in the middle of the night. Old Praga, the scary looking one regarded as unsafe by locals included. The 1.7 million city (even counted as the 2.2 million metro area) has lower levels of homicide and violent than my home town most years. Not per capita only. But in just plain numbers. So the difference is insane from my perspective.

Also, there is the fact that in the US you have to know the bad districts, the ones where when you hit a read light you don‚Äôt stop at night, as they do exist. The wrong sides of tracks, or well, just West Memphis, Camden or parts of Chicago‚Äôs south side. These can be confusing and it‚Äôs easy to take the wrong turn even not going off the beaten path, just say choosing a cheaper motel. So again, a ranking for the wealthy who don‚Äôt chose such motels. When I lived in LA for a year, locals were baffled by the fact that due to pop culture tourists think that Inglewood, or Compton, are dangerous no go areas, when in the most parts they are not, and the true bad place is DTLA at night and on weekends especially, so a motel in Inglewood is a better choice than there. If you have to obtain such knowledge before going somewhere, the place is clearly in the medium category imho.

I also am not a fan of the poor-ish safety situation in the US and would like us to finally have European safety levels and such rankings, which treat us kindly, sadly don‚Äôt help imho.",,/r/europe/comments/dzyo0z/all_eight_safest_countries_in_the_world_are/f8bkh0v/,JoseMikey,1574438997

NRW imported nuclear energy, but then needed to increase it's own production, which is 50% lignite, as it was the cheapest back then. 
Also the reason gas went down that time, as only current CO2 prices make it cheaper and this Emission trade is on EU level.


The conclusion is part's of Germany replaced nuclear with coal, because it was cheaper, as CO2 Emissionen were priced too low, which was changed on EU level, I think 2018.
If NRW had been imported from neighbouring countries the increase in lignite would quite low.

These private US companies did not have an agenda, they were just trying to make more money, by drilling as fas as they can, and producing as much as they can while prices were at all time historic heights. This of course destroyed the fragile balance of supply &amp; demand of oil&amp;gas, and the prices came crushing down in 2014. This killed the economoies of petro-states, such as Venezeuela, Russia, Saudi Arabia etc. Now, at this stage, with the new low prices, it was not profitable in the US either. But they kept drilling, even at a loss, by borrowing huge sums of credit. Saudis kept producing at full speed too, saying they can make money at low costs, too, which is only partially true. 

When people were trying to figure out why the US and the US-puppets in Saudi are still driving the price down by producing at full speed at the cost of losing money; one explanation was that it was hurting Russia, so they didn't mind.

2663,"I disagree because again, the volume are multiple order of magnitude apart.

With nuclear waste let's take the worse case and we just put it in the open somewhere and do nothing, letting it leak and contaminate the environment. If we take all the nuclear wastes produced worldwide since the 50's (the truly dangerous one that need millions of year, not the one that will be safe after a couple decade) it would be a pile few football field worth of area and a few meter high, it's in the hundreds of thousands tons. As it leaks it would render the surrounding barren but the further it leaks the more it dilutes so the affected area stay relatively small, if we want to be catastrophic it should be around a few thousand square kilometer. Now it's not like there aren't bigger place on Earth that are already barren so just put your waste here and nothing of value is lost. Even in the worse case it stay a localized issue. Heck if we just dumped it in the ocean, dilution alone would ensure that it the increased radioactivity is barely noticeable (you would notice the artificial isotopes but the radiation emitted would stay well below safety margin). 

Of course dumping it in the ocean is a bad idea because geological storage is better even in the worse case but it's a simple solution that cost almost nothing.

CO2 on the other hand is the tens of gigaton produced per year, so 100000x the mass of all the nuclear waste to deal with each year. You can't simply capture it and store it somewhere, it is a global issue. Even if handling 1 ton of CO2 cost just 10 euros (conservative estimate of carbon capture are in the couple hundreds range), it would cost more to deal with one year worth of CO2 than to spend 1 million‚Ç¨ per ton of nuclear wastes.

With nuclear energy scale is a big factor, sure one powerplant is crazy expensive and one ton of nuclear waste is hard to deal with, but one nuclear powerplant produce a crazy amount of energy so you don't need many and one ton of nuclear waste is a significant fraction of the total wastes so you don't have that much to deal with.","BZH, Bienvenue en Zone Humide",/r/europe/comments/dzf4iw/this_is_what_happens_when_its_not_sunny_nor_windy/f8atfk4/,C0ldSn4p,1574410981

2813,"Wow, way to completely cherry pick quotes from the article to advance your own narrative. There are several paragraphs stating the US's issues with the treaty. 


&gt; **American and European complaints**
&gt; 
&gt; Critics of the treaty have complained that Russia restricts flights near the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and the Georgian border-conflict regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The U.S. responded with flight restrictions over parts of Hawaii and Alaska.
&gt; 
&gt; However, in Brussels, Trump administration officials challenged NATO ally Germany‚Äôs plan to test a new infrared sensor in a flight over the United States in 2020, arguing it would open the door for Russia to do the same. Russia‚Äôs Tupolev Tu-154 already progressed from wet film to a digital electro-optical sensor in 2017, which at the time raised concerns within the Pentagon and the U.S. intelligence community.
&gt; 
&gt; Another U.S. concern is a claim that there‚Äôs no way under the Open Skies Treaty for signatories to know if Russia is surreptitiously gathering intelligence on U.S. forces while en route to its scheduled overflights. For example, the U.S. was concerned Russia‚Äôs aircraft would focus its sensors on American forces in Poland while flying to Germany. (Cameras on Open Skies aircraft are supposed to be covered during transit flights between the host nation and the area being surveilled.)

The US's satellite technology is sufficient that there is no real benefit to doing the fly overs in Russia, which as noted in the article, are restricted by Russia. Why should we let Russia flyover the US to get intelligence when we can't fly where we want and don't need to to gather the intel? The article alludes to Russia misusing the treaty to undermine US national security, the extent to which is classified.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/dzsupe/us_to_europe_fix_open_skies_treaty_or_we_quit/f8agk37/,verloren7,1574396676

2857,"Great video but just for the context PJ Thum is not an opposition candidate, he is an academic scholar that got into trouble because of his research that focused on [operation coldstore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Coldstore) where hundreds of opposition figure got arrested in 1963. Last year, he was [grilled for 3 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7riDKnI8mO4) by a select comittee when the government started tackling the problem of ""falsehood"" (in the wake of the cambridge analytica scandal). He also run a website called ""newnarratif"" which is focused on south east asia socio-political issue, including Singapore of course. He is what you would called a ""leftist"" in the political spectrum and somewhat of an activist but he isn't an opposition candidate (at least not yet, I don't think he would have enough support at the moment to attempt something like this in a near future) .

I'd also like to add that at least in Singapore he is a controversial figure and I don't think he has many backers. Most people are quite supportive of PAP, they complain a lot (sometime angrily) over the government but for the most part I feel like they trust and expect the PAP to be competent enough to fix the problems rather than threatening it to vote for another party. Some people have described singapore as an illiberal democracy (like in this [excellent article](https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-comparing-singapore-hong-kong/)).

2861,"Again, I don't think you can argue for legitimacy of a political system solely based on its outcomes. In other words, if you truly believe that the people should have a say in the government, then it doesn't matter if that makes your country rich or poor. Because it's the right thing to do. For example, if you believe in a dictatorship of the proletariat, you genuinely believe that workers should reign supreme in society, even oppressing the owners of capital. If you have this belief, then it doesn't matter if your country is rich or poor because of it. The outcomes don't legitimize the political system. Because there are good and bad outcomes in every conceivable way of organizing a government. And when nations descend into chaos or authoritarianism , it's because of the actions of those in power have lost the mandate of the people. 

Benevolent dictatorships are unsustainable. After the leader dies, someone else will take the helm. Eventually, a leader will come into power who is not benevolent. You're sacrificing the long term freedom of the people for short term gains. With one person or party in charge, there will always be the risk for corruption and mismanagement. And there will be no one to hold them accountable. Worse, with a one party, authoritarian state, the opposition is whittled away over time. The government may have majority support, but when the voice of the opposition is taken away, you deprive citizens of the opportunity to hear alternative viewpoints. Citizens become slaves to the perceived benefits of the benevolent dictatorship. Because when the economy crashes or the trade dries up, the one thing holding the society together suddenly disappears; and the people finally wake up to the authoritarian nightmare they live in.",,/r/europe/comments/dzlnth/the_eusingapore_free_trade_agreementipa_enters/f8ajgum/,sheffieldasslingdoux,1574399166

I'll give you this. I do not hold the false believe that people joined Daesh to just cut people's heads off in public. They joined because they thought this was a way to make the world a better place, even if I disagree with them.

 If they have killed, perhaps who they killed should matter (problem being we don't know who did or did not kill in general). Also who is responsible, Fransisco De Vetoria believed that the ones who give orders should be punished not the soldiers. Micheal Walzer argued that you give your right to live up when you decide to take someone else's life, wether you succede or not. While they started the invasion, if you joined when other groups started winning against them then weren't you just a man defending his life? (Again I don't support them but I'm just saying.)

 Solitary confinement for all your life is a punishment far greater than the death penalty, there is no reason to live besides living itself.

Life sentences are death penalties prolonged. In prison there is a saying: ""when you're gone you're forgotten"", basically no one will come to visit them after the first couple of years. Loneliness is a pain that you don't understand until you feel it, trust me on this, dying is a better alternative to that horror.

Also some economic benefits of the death penalty prisoners of *average* calibers also cost over 200‚Ç¨ per day(here in Holland at least)(200*365=73000 annually)(50 years of that=3.650.000‚Ç¨). Now I'm not sure what the immediate threat level of these captives is so I won't try to highball it.

&gt;The term that predates the British state (I assume you are referring to the Greek / Roman argument) was also incorrect (or can you prove why it was correct or a, reason why it should be used now at the very least) when it was used. So it's not really a good argument for continuing to use it.

I'm referring to the map makers using it from 1513, more widely by 1550s through to present day. As for correct it's as arbitrary as any other name. 

It's suitable in the same way we have names for archipelagos or island chains.

&gt;There is no British state (currently) from what I can see. To what are you referring? Is it a historical state, the UK or Great Britain or a, collection of islands that is colloquially referred to as such?

The British state as in the United kingdom, which existed form 1707 and is named after the largest of the isles Great Britain. Much like the USA is named after the continent it sits on. Or Indonesia is named for the archipelago it sits on. That does not mean that The sultanate of Brunii is Indonesian or that Canadians are Americans.

The thing at fault is the British politicising the denonym, ideally it would be non political like Scandinavian or Iberian. This could be grounds for changing it. Revisionist history is not.",England,/r/europe/comments/dzdryr/euler_diagram_of_the_british_isles/f88r863/,Pleberal,1574359636

2019 is gearing up to be an even better year than 2018 as far as emissions reduction goes. If 2020 is like that too, Germany could come very close or even meet its -40% reduction target, which is an extremely ambitious target. And you specifically said that Germany is increasing emissions, while in reality is the opposite. When you are one of the best in the entire world as far as emissions reduction goes, it‚Äôs difficult to say that you‚Äôre ‚Äúwasting a lot of political and economic effort‚Äù. If only the rest of the world had a 40% (or close to it) fall in emissions since 1990 like Germany, we‚Äôd have more than 2 decades longer to solve the problem.

And lastly, Germany is not implementing the policies that most environmentalists want. A carbon tax or allowances market is something that every environmentalist considers necessary, and while 50% of German emissions are covered by the EU ETS, the remaining 50% (heating and transport sectors) are not as of now, it will only happen from 2021-2022, and the price set for allowances by the German government is pathetic (10‚Ç¨/ton of CO2, to increase to 20‚Ç¨ the second year, and then to 35‚Ç¨ and then to a range between 35‚Ç¨ and 60‚Ç¨). Considering most scientists suggest 40‚Ç¨ is the absolute minimum necessary, to increase to more than 100‚Ç¨ by 2030 at the latest, what Germany is proposing is truly a joke. Then there is the bullshit rule of minimum distance between a wind turbine and houses equal to 10 times the height of the turbine, which practically caused a collapse in onshore wind installations in Germany in 2017-2019 (combined with NIMBY from idiots). Then the fact that once it decided for the last time (after Fukushima) to exit nuclear, it didn‚Äôt immediately plan an accelerated renewables expansion to completely compensate for the nuclear exit. And then the fact that both offshore and onshore wind targets for 2030 are unambitious, with both industry and environmentalists saying that Germany could do much more. Even the solar target could be improved. And then obviously the most overlooked dimension of the transition to a low carbon economy, energy efficiency, where Germany is far away from its targets.

That‚Äôs not to say everything is bad. As I just said before, even with all this Germany still did better than almost any other country, it‚Äôs just that it could do even more, so much more, it if weren‚Äôt for the CDU/CSU who are always unambitious (interestingly environmental matters is probably the only topic where the CSU is to the left of the CDU, thanks to the beating the CSU took in the last Bavarian elections because of the Greens) and the FDP who are free market fanatics, who tanked the coalition talks between CDU/CSU-Greens-FDP... and there shouldn‚Äôt be any need to mention the AfD, who are lunatics and completely retarded, believing that man made climate change isn‚Äôt a reality.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/dzf4iw/this_is_what_happens_when_its_not_sunny_nor_windy/f88cr44/,Etain05,1574352483

There still can be meltdown, and nuclear material might exit the containment through cracks etc. But it simply cannot happen in Chernobyl type scaled.

3563,"There is a big leap though from wanting to implement Islamic policies and:

&gt;political the whole point of islamism is to be the political part of Islam, aiming at religious conquest/supremacy.

Because Islamism isn't focused around religious conquest or supremacy, again that is Islamic extremism or jihadism. Of course Islamism is guided by Islamic principles, why else would it be called Islamism?

&gt;There is no space for secularism in islamist (not islamic!) worldview, because religion is laced into every aspect of social and political life. The sacred book is the ultimate reference for lawmaking, and usually hadiths come second.

Again, no. If you would just read a few paragraphs further on Wikipedia:

&gt;Bayat explained it as ""a condition where, following a phase of experimentation, the appeal, energy, symbols and sources of legitimacy of Islamism get exhausted, even among its once-ardent supporters. As such, post-Islamism is not anti-Islamic, but rather reflects a tendency to resecularize religion.""

3695,"&gt; A large scale renewable effort would have similar problems

Look at the evidence. Investments in renewables in terms of both nominal and effective MWs far outstrip the installation of new nuclear. The latest figures for China show that renewables now constitute 50% of new power.

Energy installations tend to last 50+ years and new power is installed as needed, so change takes time. But if you look at what has been done the last 15 years, renewables are already delivering.

From a formal point of view, renewables are also, in general, less complex. Installing one 2-4 MW windmill is a piece of cake, relatively speaking. Installing 100 of them isn't much harder, because if one of them is delayed, it doesn't stop the others.

3739,"&gt;ere were Polish Nazi collaborators j

They were, but when this topic comes up in media or from politicians it is emphasized in a strange way. You almost get the feeling that it was institutionalized by polish structures or support for genocide was higher than in other countries, which is very hurting because of 2 things.

1. Slavic people were a target of genocide as well during that time from the same structures. Famous camp, Auschwitz, was originally prepared not for jews but poles for example.
2. Poles were among the top of Jewish helpers during that time, I think per capita only Netherlands had more? we actually had organization that focused on providing aid to Jewish ""≈ºegota"". Penalty for helping jews was also higher for poles ( and other Slavic people?) than in the majority of occupied Europe.

Answer: You don't. The amount of people who travel to Sweden from Norway just to get cheaper shit is small at best, and most of them live pretty much on the border anyway. Those who live in Oslo, Stavanger, Trondheim, Bergen and so on are most likely just going to deal with the increase in price instead of introducing an annoying trip to Sweden into their schedule.

You are right, they occupied us in 1940-1941 and in 1944-1991. That's certainly more than 40 years indeed.

&gt;After WW2 they owned that land

That's not how any of that works. You cannot legally own a land you obtained illegally. Why are you even arguing here if you don't understand this cornerstone of international law?

&gt;Indeed, and I am not the only one who saw said article and judged you accordingly.

Yes, most people in democratic countries judge us in a good way and don't suck up to hostile dictatorships like you do.

&gt;You are not competent enough to make that conclusion.

I probably am though, considering that my arguments are based on facts, unlike yours.

&gt;Ou boi, if you are mad about it then dont read about European history from like 1k BC till pretty much right now.

International law has changed a lot since 1k BC... Conquest used to be legal, but it became illegal between certain countries (including [between Estonia and the USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellogg%E2%80%93Briand_Pact)) in the 1920s and 1930s.

&gt;(And definitely dont read about how Duchy of Estonia became a thing, because spoiler alert, there was no legality in there).

Actually, there was... We may not like it, but it certainly was legal according to the international law in place at the time...

Again, if you don't know this field, why are you arguing so confidently?

&gt;Hahaha. Cherry picking at its finest. You are lucky Estonia is so irrelevant that 

It's not cherry picking at all. These three were sovereign countries that the USSR occupied. That wasn't the case for other Soviet states.

This sounds closer to an elementary school cafeteria than an international dining hall.

*looks at paper*

&gt;E-democracy  is  a  political  dialogue  in  which  citizens,  and  communities  in  general,  engage in the political process using computer-based technology.

Ah.  So...social media.

&gt;To communicate within Europe, people learn English. Yet, a lot of people still do not 
speak  English  sufficiently  well.  An  alternative  for  using  English  might  be  
receptive multilingualism:  speakers  of  two  different,  but  related  languages  both  speak  their  own  
language  and  can  understand  each  other  to  a  certain  extent.  This  is  possible  when  
languages  are  mutually  intelligible.  The  Scandinavian  languages,  for  instance,  have  a  
high  degree  of  mutual  intelligibility,  and  receptive  multilingualism  is  widely  used  in  
Scandinavia. 

-

&gt;The situation is Central and Eastern Europe is particularly challenging. The region is 
a  patchwork  of  small,  mostly  Slavic  countries,  each  of  them  having  its  own  national  language.  Most  of  these  languages  are  not  mutually  intelligible,  and  knowledge  of  English  in  generally  low  among  their  citizens.


Wait a minute.  Isn't the inability of Scandinavians to understand Danish a standing joke on this sub?  Like, I've seen comics about it, a video poking fun at it...

*googles*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_intelligibility

&gt; Northern Germanic languages spoken in Scandinavia form a dialect continuum where two furthermost dialects have almost no mutual intelligibility. As such, spoken Danish and Swedish normally have low mutual intelligibility,[7] but Swedes in the √ñresund region (including Malm√∂ and Helsingborg), across a strait from the Danish capital Copenhagen, understand Danish somewhat better, largely due to the proximity of the region to Danish-speaking areas. While Norway was under Danish rule, the Bokm√•l written standard of Norwegian developed from Dano-Norwegian, a koin√© language that evolved among the urban elite in Norwegian cities during the later years of the union. Additionally, Norwegian assimilated a considerable amount of Danish vocabulary as well as traditional Danish expressions.[7] As a consequence, spoken mutual intelligibility is not reciprocal.[7]

4180,"Alien contact would be really cool, but as a jello American (jesting on fellow), alas I must say that there doesn't seem to be any such disclosure happening over here.

I don't think aliens would really want to contact Earth.  Humans are kind of bizarrely suck-tastic and do terrible things to each other.  If aliens are like humans with more technology, they'll probably want to keep their distance to avoid empowering us.  If aliens are *better* than humans, whether they're actually better or just stuck up, they'll probably want to keep their distance because we suck.

As for the idea that they might uplift us with new technology and ideas...  Well...  An uplift scenarios would be pretty great... to me.  I think that'd be great.  It would be fit to my preferences.  The reason why it would be fit to my preferences is because I'm okay being the nobody's nobody in an improving system.  I'd want to quibble with the conditions, but I'm *potentially* okay with being treated as a pet, a second-class citizen, or an unusually intelligent animal.  How many people are potentially okay with those things?  If aliens are blatantly and supremely better than us, such that their metaphorical hearts metaphorically break for our suffering, they might still be keeping away because uplifting us would make much of humanity miserable.  It might be a waste of advanced potentials that we'd never recover from.

It should be mentioned that, of course, if they're worse than us, we don't want to meet them anyways.

I also want to mention the possibility that ancient alien cultures might be desperate for new entertainments.  This is one of the conjectures sometimes used as thanatosian propaganda on Earth to oppose life extension rhetoric.  If their ethics are distinctively mediocre, Very Bored Aliens (VBAs) might decide to form sociopathic stalker societies that gamble on up-and-coming new sapiences, in which case uplift scenarios would ruin their fun.  If their ethics are not quite that bad, VBAs might instead form anthropological societies that export data on primitive cultures as one of the great novelties of their society, in which case uplift probability would be a function of the above ethical/societal calculations modified by the particular extent of the boredom premium (ie, is the anthropological data really that interesting?).",,/r/europe/comments/dzam71/what_are_europeans_thoughts_on_extraterrestrials/f86tr3t/,ShengjiYay,1574306708

Things like immigration, where most of the speakers only really worry about that dark skin with funny clothes but silently welcome the underpaid workers that come in bus loads.

While at the same time the listener is more worried about the latter, as they see themselves or their kids being pushed out of the workforce because they have to ask for a wage that align with local costs.

lol what a load of bullshit.

Trieste, in particular, was only briefly touched by the Longobards. It was, until incorporated into the Carolingian empire, an outpost of the exarchate of Ravenna, i.e. the last piece of Italian land held by the Byzantine empire. 

At most you could've said that late Romans, as the ones who inhabited Friuli and Istria, were not Italians, whose ethnic identity emerged some centuries afterwards, in the late middle ages.

In any case, Trieste has always had a minority of Slovenes, not even during the K.u.K. monarchy.

&gt;Okay mr ""oppression cannot happen under democratically elected government."" You are right about that, don't worry, but saying ""one doesn't count because it's democracy"" is a shite argument.

Wtf is this word salad supposed to mean? You're sure you're replying to the right comment?

&gt;Because in the original comment you said PRC isn't a legal regime. Which is factually wrong and holds a certain bias.

Ah, okay. The CPC is an illegitimate government considering it violently deposed the previous democratic, legitimate government and haven't finished them off yet. You can go ahead and pretend they have all the legitimacy in the world, but the fact that they need to keep the populace in line via brute force suggests otherwise.

&gt;Them going from house to house? Yeah, I can see that. Full blown concentration camps like in Xinjiang? No.

We'll see in a year or two lol

&gt;Well, they are. LGBT rights are human rights, so are rights to abortion. There are much more, of course. Because PiS is paying you in-hand it doesn't mean you have to spew such nonsense on such a meaningless reddit.

Human rights are constitutionally guaranteed in Poland, as well as by EU law which Poland is subject to.

&gt;Interesting definition of ""communism"" and ""communist regime"". Too bad it's biased and most scholars don't agree with you on it. DPRK isn't communist either. But sure, sure. And US is not a democracy, but a republic. Yes Yes.

Yeah, I'm sure armchair 'scholars' think the CPC is anything other than a communist regime. What next, Marx was actually an anarcho-capitalist?

&gt;Because some old folk fucked you by mass voting the party that will give you the most and you voted for a party that aims to protect your rights, then no, I didn't vote for that party. Guess British people also chose to get out of EU, even though half the population didn't want Brexit. People of Britain, hmmmmmmmm. Guess the people that fought in Russian Civil War on Reds side and later got purged had to deal with consequences of their actions... wait, nah, let's say population of Russia had to deal with their consequences of letting the Soviets win.

&gt;Shit. Logic.

Like it or not, it's the republican system at work. 

And holy shit, comparing democratic elections to a violent civil war? Good Lord, I thought you were stupid but now I'm pretty sure you have an extra chromosome. Y'know what shit logic is? Comparing apples to a fucking jet engine.

&gt;Don't make me laugh... Is this a serious answer? Even wikipedia will tell you Poland is miles away from LGBT rights that the UK has.

Sure.

&gt;Ban? No, deplatform them and tax them, so that they don't benefit from the government money. And pass secularizing legistations. They definitely have a political power because they are, again, best partners with PiS. The abortion law passed specifically because of the Church and their propaganda telling, how ""they are killing children"" and other sorts of low-minded catch-phrases. Have you been to Poland? Have you seen bilboards?

If the abortion law didn't have the support of the common folk then it wouldn't pass. I'm pretty sure it didn't anyway because if the black protests.

&gt;Oh sorry, I didn't know you were from Hong Kong, I thought you are a Britbong. My baaaaaad.

I thought you were a Pole, but now I'm pretty sure you're a cabbage. You have the intellectual maturity of one anyway.

&gt;Some do, some seriously see LGBT as a cultural problem for Poland. Also does everything have to come to extermination? That's oppression now? Gee, I gotta tell the Afro-American folk that they weren't oppressed because they exist. Telling them they didn't have their rights stripped and they didn't experience violence both from American society and government.

Alright bb, show me some sources and legislation where it says that you can legally keep LGBT+ folk as slaves. Show me some legislation that enforces segregation, institutionalised racism, and all the other shit that black people had to go through because of state-sponsored oppression. 

&gt;Think again, you wouldn't know that. You probably wouldn't even care about that. Because you now have access to countless historical documents proving that it was indeed the case, you wouldn't have access to such papers 80 years ago.

A a high sugar intake leads to increased risk for diabetes and weight gain which in turn massively increased the risk of stroke, heart failure, heart attacks, hormonal problems like increasingly early menstruations for girls which leads to a whole bunch of problems.

4404,"&gt;It seems like in your head everyone is either Estonian or Kremlin troll.

No, only people spreading Kremlin propaganda are Kremlin trolls. You are spreading Kremlin propaganda, ergo you are a Kremlin troll.

&gt;By that I mean citizens of other NATO countries

Oh don't worry. Some citizens of NATO countries can also be Kremlin trolls if they act like them.

&gt;we wont help you once you start shit with Russia

We have hardly started anything with Russia ever and you are in no position to make the decision whether NATO members will or won't aide Estonia should Russia attack it.

&gt;Just stop, it makes you look like you are out of touch.

You are referring to the fact that Russia has controlled this land since 1940/1944. Nobody denies that, in fact I insist on that being true. However, what you don't understand is the difference between ownership and possession  - Russia controlling the land does not mean it owns it.

&gt;So Estonian SSR could not legally agree in the name of Estonia, but it could legally rename itself as Republic of Estonia.

Estonian SSR essentially staged a coup against the Soviet occupation regimes that installed it. The Estonian SSR then organized free elections and the electorate which consisted mostly of the rightful citizens of the Republic of Estonia elected a democratically representative parliament, which immediately declared the Soviet occupation to be illegal and implemented a period of transition for restoring the full independence of the Republic of Estonia. Thereafter, *before* the actual full restoration of independence, it itself renamed itself the ""Republic of Estonia"", which a year later managed to restore the full independence of Estonia and end the Soviet occupation.

I ask of you - what was an occupied nation to do? What other super effective means do you think it had in ending the Soviet occupation and restoring its independence?

&gt;You cant make this shit up lmao.

&gt;  support democratic referenda. I don't endorse republican tactics like lying and bribing the populace. We live under a republican system so unfortunately our referenda are marred by the system's influence. 

Okay mr ""oppression cannot happen under democratically elected government."" You are right about that, don't worry, but saying ""one doesn't count because it's democracy"" is a shite argument.

&gt; Then why bring it up if you're not making a justification for those actions? 

Because in the original comment you said PRC isn't a legal regime. Which is factually wrong and holds a certain bias.

&gt; The CPC will definitely be going from house to house and lining up those who dared to protest against ditches and gunning then down. That, or concentration camps. Another ethnic cleansing on the same scale as the one in Xinjiang. 

Them going from house to house? Yeah, I can see that. Full blown concentration camps like in Xinjiang? No.

&gt; Then stop insinuating that PiS is somehow dismantling your human rights and oppressing you. 

Well, they are. LGBT rights are human rights, so are rights to abortion. There are much more, of course. Because PiS is paying you in-hand it doesn't mean you have to spew such nonsense on such a meaningless reddit.

&gt; The CPC are a communist government through and through. Communist regimes are, both in practice and in theory, dictatorial regimes that actively engage in ethnic cleansing, massacres, violations of human rights, brutal oppression, etc. Every communist regime to have ever existed has at least a few ditches filled with bodies of 'anti-revolutionary' victims. The CPC, the USSR, the Derg, the DPRK, etc. 

Interesting definition of ""communism"" and ""communist regime"". Too bad it's biased and most scholars don't agree with you on it. DPRK isn't communist either. But sure, sure. And US is not a democracy, but a republic. Yes Yes.

&gt; People in the UK suffer when the Tory government cuts down the welfare state or privatises the NHS, but I wouldn't call it oppression. The British population has chosen to put the Tories in power, and chose to deal with the consequences of their actions. Same goes for Poland. 

Because some old folk fucked you by mass voting the party that will give you the most and you voted for a party that aims to protect your rights, then no, I didn't vote for that party. Guess British people also chose to get out of EU, even though half the population didn't want Brexit. People of Britain, hmmmmmmmm. Guess the people that fought in Russian Civil War on Reds side and later got purged had to deal with consequences of their actions... wait, nah, let's say population of Russia had to deal with their consequences of letting the Soviets win.

Shit. Logic.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; LGBT+ folk are about as persecuted in Poland as they are here, which is to say not much since in both countries the inalienable rights of LGBT+ folks are secured and guaranteed in legislation. 

Don't make me laugh... Is this a serious answer? Even wikipedia will tell you Poland is miles away from LGBT rights that the UK has.

&gt; Then we should ban any organisation that may or may not accidentally influence the way people think? If people want to listen to what the Church says then it's well within their rights to do so. No matter what people think of the Church, it doesn't change the fact that they have zero political power at all. 

Ban? No, deplatform them and tax them, so that they don't benefit from the government money. And pass secularizing legistations. They definitely have a political power because they are, again, best partners with PiS. The abortion law passed specifically because of the Church and their propaganda telling, how ""they are killing children"" and other sorts of low-minded catch-phrases. Have you been to Poland? Have you seen bilboards? Organizations tied to Church mass produce propaganda for PiS.

&gt; Let's also not act like the Church were innocent saints during POs reign either. 

I didn't say PO is good, it's better than PiS, but not quite good.

&gt; Don't talk shit about Hong Kong if you're not from Hong Kong. 

Oh sorry, I didn't know you were from Hong Kong, I thought you are a Britbong. My baaaaaad.

&gt; If that was true then they would've exterminated all the LGBT+ folk already Hitler style. The fact that they haven't supports the reality that PiS politicians only bash LGBT+ before elections in order to drum up support from conservative Poles. 

Some do, some seriously see LGBT as a cultural problem for Poland. Also does everything have to come to extermination? That's oppression now? Gee, I gotta tell the Afro-American folk that they weren't oppressed because they exist. Telling them they didn't have their rights stripped and they didn't experience violence both from American society and government.

&gt; During the Weimar Republic every political ideology had armed thugs running around killing people. The Nazis were no different and continued to use armed thugs to oppress people long after they took over. Of course I would call it oppression. You on the other hand see oppression in everything you don't like. If Kaczynski sneezed you'd call it oppression. 

Think again, you wouldn't know that. You probably wouldn't even care about that. Because you now have access to countless historical documents proving that it was indeed the case, you wouldn't have access to such papers 80 years ago. But sure, you know everything. Like how apparently every communist wants to eat your children. Mhm...

Now come on, why would I write some academic research paper on Reddit?

&gt;what would Russians have to do to own said land, instead of just possesing it.

Have the right to it, i.e. they need to have gotten this possession in a legal manner, which they haven't as they stole it from an illegally occupied sovereign state, in a clear breach of their bilateral peace/border treaty ([Treaty of Tartu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tartu_\(Russian%E2%80%93Estonian\))) and of basic principles of international law.

Your question is like ""what would I have to do to own a wallet I stole, instead of just possessing it?""

&gt;Oh I am fine with whatever Estonian SSR did to gain its independence. Just dont cherry pick which nations are succesors of Soviet Republics and which arent.

Again, that's not how things work.

The USSR as a whole has **one** sole legal successor, and it is Russia. 

12 post-Soviet states are legal successors of their respective SSRs.

Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are not legal successors of neither the Soviet Union, nor of the Soviet-imposed SSRs in their sovereign territory.

&gt;Mainly because I realized how disilusioned some Estonians in this day and age are but whatever.

Disillusioned about what? It is you, who lacks basic knowledge about history and international laws here. What even gives you the arrogance to claim that I am the disillusioned one here?

4669,"&gt; You put yourself in a comment thread about comparing Serbia and Bulgaria.

Oh no, I guess I never should have corrected you to avoid the sin of comparing Serbia and Bulgaria (which is of course OK for you to commit). It's ridiculous to expect me not to comment on a comparison between us, especially when you're already doing that.   


&gt;2004 and 2007 EU countries? You are the poorest among those countries and therefore you should have the highest growth.  

As the map I linked shows we are among the fastest growing ones since 98. I don't know about since 2007 but you're welcoming to show such a map (as long as it tracks GDP per capita and not just GDP).   

Either way current levels of development are not the only thing that affects growth rates. We're literally the most remote EU country. Romania is closer to the centre, Greece has ports close to Italy, Latvia is close to Finland and a swim away from Sweden and of course all the Central European countries are right there near the centre usually sharing a direct border with Western Europe. We are far from such privileges, Turkey is not Germany and its currency has been imploding recently hitting our exports hard.   

I also wouldn't directly compare us to countries that have been in the EU for 3 more years, 3 crucial pre-crisis years when global investment was flying left and right and they also got to enjoy an entirely different programming period of EU funds.     

I don't know who's grown more and I think we have both advantages and disadvantages compared to them (like the brain-drain I didn't mention before). We certainly have our homegrown problems like higher corruption and maybe we could/should have been undisputed champions if we had taken care of that. But failing to do that is not the same as failing in general.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/dyqmp5/gdp_growth_in_2019_imf_projection/f853bpo/,ZmeiOtPirin,1574266729
4670,"&gt; I think (even more so today than during the Cold War) economic considerations are the actual deterrence. Can't invade a country you depend on economically unless you are willing to cripple your own country.

History has proven that this is false. WWI started even though world economies were already interconnected.

&gt;But apparently they don't deter fighting in border regions, proxy wars, cyber attacks or anything else that doesn't amount to an existential threat.

Nuclear weapons deter total war between great powers, this produces more proxy wars, but proxy wars in far away regions are certainly better than a large scale total war between great powers.

No they're not. They aren't even a solution at this point since you can't generate power reliably.

4762,"&gt; Yes, because one is democratic and the other isn't. It's as simple as that. 

You support lying to your own populace if it's under the coat of democracy, okay.

&gt; The Munich agreement, the Holocaust, the invasion of Poland, etc, were all simply 'legal procedures' decided upon by the legal authorities of Germany and other countries. Are you going to make the case that they are morally justifiable and okay because they were 'legal procedures'? 

Sorry, I never made a claim of moral justification for any of this, neither did I morally justify 1997 agreement. Munich agreement happened legally, Holocaust and invasion of Poland broke international laws. All of those were morally wrong. But we are not speaking of morality here, but legality.

&gt; Whatever it started out as doesn't matter, it's clearly evolved into a much bigger fight for the human rights of the people of Hong Kong, their rights to democratic self-determination free from communist interference, and against further encroachment on their existing rights by communist authorities in Beijing. Is it a futile protest that will result in the ethnic cleansing of Hong Kong? Most likely yes. Will I continue to support Hong Kong regardless because it's the morally right thing to do? Yes. 

I don't think ethnic cleansing will happen, no. It will get more brutal in the future, yes, but no ethnic cleansing of HK people, especially since both are the same ethnicity.  Support their efforts all you want, I only want to state that it's futile effort. No one will stop China.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Lol. The Communist Party of China isn't communist but PiS is an oppressive fascist party hellbent on installing a fascist dictatorship in Poland? Good Lord, the mental gymnastics at play here. 

Show me where I called PiS fascist, please. They are rightist populists, not fascists. Stop putting words into my mouth. No one is installing any fascist dictatorship in Poland. And China is factually not communist. I would argue it's fascist actually, considering the Chinese nationalism, their ""bullying through their capitalist economy"", etrenched party and Uyghur genocide happening right now. Because they have communist in their name, it doesn't mean they are. Unless you think Nazis were socialists or that NK is democratic. Fascists and tankies are pretty close to each other in their efforts to undermine democratic institutions and taking freedoms from the populace.

&gt;   Ah, so it's POs fault that they didn't ensure proper procedures to safeguard the parade and protect the parade-goers from skinheads. Also, giving money to propaganda outlets isn't oppression. It's a core part of the republican system like political donations.

It's oppression, when people suffer due to that. And LGBT community suffers due to that, to misinformation and propaganda against them, persecutions and forcefully changing their ways of living.

""Core part of the republican system"" oh screw you. People are getting hurt due to those decisions and you don't care because ""that's how republicanism works"". ok

&gt; The Church is quite powerless to do anything so you don't need to worry about what a bunch of old men in funny gowns say. The Church isn't owned by PiS anyway, so that's a moot point. 

ahahahahahahaha

PiS in one bed with the Church. The Church in itself supposedly has no ""political influence"", but they have influence over people's opinions of political aspects. Not to mention that they get away with a lot of shady shit due to being best buds with PiS party. Don't talk shit about polish politics if you are not from Poland.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The insinuation that you're oppressed because a few skinheads attacked a few parade-goers in some backward bumfuck city is just disrespectful to everyone else who actually face serious political persecution, to people who are actually at risk of being severely hurt or killed for the audacity to even *protest* against their regimes, something that is a core right in Poland guaranteed by its legal authorities. Your issue here is that people are expressing their political rights to freedom of speech and opinions, and that the police did a shit job at and after the parade, which isn't oppression. 

Jesus Chirst, read again. PiS *funds this violence, they support this violence. PiS supports taking rights away from the LGBT community, women and minorities.*

4763,"&gt;You haven't at all. You said 'this book says different', and linked to a TV show that doesn't refute what I said.

I didn't say anything about a book, lol. But no credible academic is assuming the English and Scottish unified out of an act of altruism, but for some bizzare reason, you're clinging onto the assumption that people like me think it was, we don't lol.

&gt;I never even said this. I said this is the message that is portrayed as the mainstream narrative. I assume most people know that it was a pseudo-colonial endeavour to integrate the religiously similar Scottish upper-classes into the fold through the sabotage of the Darien venture by the English Navy, followed by the paying off of the personal debts of Scottish Lords, as a means to expand English influence over the whole of Britain. Had this been rejected, it would have been done by force. We can see this attempt at English-based centralisation through our knowledge of the Jacobite uprisings which crushed Gaelic culture in favour of Anglocentric centralisation. 

&gt;I never even said this. I said this is the message that is portrayed as the mainstream narrative

I've just cited a documentary which pretty much said it was done out of vested interests on *both sides* and that the machinations of unification had been pretty much gaining ground for the century prior. You like to assume the act of Union was precipitated by one act when in fact it was a culmination of factors which contributed to the act of Union when it wasn't. Oh and whilst you're content to blame the English for the failure of the Darien scheme, please be aware that the Spanish actually besieged Darien which the organisers never anticipated. 

And if you're gonna harp on about the Jacobite uprising, maybe not trying to overthrow the existing British monarch with one of your own is the best way to go about it.

4806,"&gt; **Why do Kurdish authorities spend so much money on getting back Yazidis?**  
   
&gt;  
&gt; \- It's a kind of duty. The Yazidis have already suffered so much. If you can save lives with money, they are willing to pay.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; Nemam Ghafouri has a plan to skip the smugglers working as a middle hand, and avoid paying IS supporters. She intends to cross the border herself, into Syria and to the al-Hol camp to try to find Yazidis who are still in captivity. To assist her, stands a Yazidian organization in Syria, Mala Yazidi, and three Yazidian women who have all been slaves to IS and freed: Widad Davood, Meluk Khidir and Atke Murad.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; The idea is for women to dress as IS.women, with niqab, black all-cloth and black gloves. Masked, the former slaves should then enter the IS camp, among their oppressors, and look for kidnapped Yazidis.  
   
  In their mobiles there are pictures of missing loved ones. Meluk is looking for his sister. Atke is looking for his brother's wife and their three children.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; Widad is dressed completely in black even in ordinary cases - her grief is so great. Her husband and three of her children have been murdered by IS. There are thirteen-year-old son Rezan.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; Two years ago, Widad quickly met his son, who was then eleven, when they were both in IS captivity in different families. ""You must try to get out of here,"" Widad then urged her son. He replied that he did not dare. The IS family beat him and threatened to kill him.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; Now Widad has been told that his son Rezan is held captive by the IS supporters in al-Hol. She tries to remain emotionally stable as she shows the picture of a dark-haired boy with a soft smile. Without dropping the picture on the mobile screen with her eyes, she says:  
   
 \- He is all I have to live for now.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; Ten days later, the three Yazid women and Nemam Ghafouri in Syria stand at the gates of the al-Hol camp. There are 73,000 people in here. Many are still dedicated IS supporters. According to the Kurdish authorities, around seventy Swedes also live here, barely twenty mothers and their children.  
   
 Nemam Ghafouri has long struggled with the Kurdish bureaucracy, both on the Iraqi and Syrian sides, to work out the conditions needed for her and the women to pass all armed roadblocks and enter the camp. A Yazidian politician who was told about Nemam's expedition decided instead to conduct his own rescue expedition to free slaves.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; \- They went in, six men in total, but found none. He was probably looking for the honor, says Nemam Ghafouri.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Now Widad and Meluk are puting on the niqabs they were forced to wear during their time in captivity.  
   
  \- It feels so wrong. I hate these clothes, says Meluk.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; Nemam Ghafouri tells of a woman who entered the camp in a white t-shirt. She was attacked with stones by angry IS women, who thought her clothes were not chaste enough. When soldiers went in to protect the t-shirt woman, they were also attacked, and a car was smashed. Such attacks are common. In the IS parts of the camp, it is so dangerous that medical personnel cannot move freely, but armed guards.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; ""We have to be very careful,"" says Widad.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; The risk of being attacked means that DN's photographer Lotta H√§rdelin and I are not allowed to accompany Widad and Meluk as they infiltrate  the IS women. Widad and Meluk go from tent to tent with these women. They have devised a strategy: they will ask for Umm Hamza from Egypt, a woman they know is dead. The question is merely an excuse to have a reason to look into the tents and see if there are any Yazidis.  
   
&gt;  
&gt;Widad and Meluk also go to the market that is in al-Hol to search for family members and other Yazidis. But IS women in the camp have been warned that someone is looking for Yazid slaves, moving around in secret among those who are here.  
  
&gt;  
&gt; For Widad, it is a terrible experience. She knows her son Rezan is here somewhere - Yazidis who have been released from here have told us. But she can't find him.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, the women learn that Widad's niece has seen the Yazidic duo walking around al-Hol - and that she then ran and hid. The IS terrorist who bought her had made her pregnant, and she did not want to be forced to leave the child.

Do international agreements agreed upon by warlords and oligarchs have the backing and support of the common folk? Was the agreement decided upon with the democratic participation of Hong Kong?

Answer those questions and there's my stance on despicable shit like the 1997 handover and the Munich agreement.

The large majority want to be free from communist oppression and fight for their right to democratic self-determination in the face of overwhelming murderous adversity. Hence the 'free' part.

4829,"I make these points because it seems like you don't even have the most basic of ideas about fusion.

For example:

&gt; though I think we are a ways off from knowing which fuels we will be using 

That is simply wrong. We know the fuel that first generation fusion plants will use. It is Tritium and Deuterium. And this is because it is the easiest fuel to use for fusion. If we can't get a positive energy output from it, we won't be able to achieve it with the other types of fuel. This is a hard fact.

&gt; Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. Hydrogen escaping is absolutely harmless. 

This doesn't even matter the least. I don't know why you would ever bring this up unless you seriously have no idea about hydrogen and tritium. (Hydrogen (Protium to be exact) has 0 neutrons, Deuterium has 1, Tritium has 2.)

This is the same as saying that Uranium is safe to eat. Because U-238 is exactly that. U-238 is safe to eat because it's half-life is billions of years and it is solved in water you drink. U-235 however is not, this is the active fuel in a nuclear reactor.

Meanwhile the points i listed, i can all prove to you.

Point 3 is even mentioned in the same article you linked:

&gt; Tritium is almost always found as tritiated water and primarily enters the body when people eat or drink food or water containing tritium or absorb it through their skin. **People can also inhale tritium as a gas in the air.** 

Point 2 should be obvious.

And about Point 1, that it's hard to contain:  [https://nucleus.iaea.org/sites/fusionportal/Technical%20Meeting%20Proceedings/4th%20DEMO/website/talks/November%2015%20Sessions/Humrickhouse.pdf](https://nucleus.iaea.org/sites/fusionportal/Technical%20Meeting%20Proceedings/4th%20DEMO/website/talks/November%2015%20Sessions/Humrickhouse.pdf)

4853,"&gt; Children fathered by a Yazidic mother and an IS member as a father are called dirty, by Yazidic religious leaders. In addition, Iraqi law says that children should take over the father's religion. So if the father is a Muslim, the children also become Muslims - even if the father is dead or absent.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; In Syria, near al-Hol, there are orphanages where liberated Yazid women are forced to leave their children for adoption. Sometimes the women are deceived. They are told that they will only leave the children for a couple of days in Syria, to cross the border to Iraq where their Yazid family is located.  
   
&gt;  
&gt;\- Then they never get to see their children again, says Nemam Ghafouri.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Yazidis have their own religion where the angel Melek Taus, often symbolized by a peacock, plays an important role. In Iraq lies the holy city of Lalish to which Yazidis are invited to pilgrimage. Through the centuries, Yazidis have been subjected to religious persecution, pogroms, forced removals, forced conversions and outright genocide. Among some Muslims, the idea that Yazidis worship the Devil is mistakenly spread.  
&gt;  
&gt; The external oppression has created a strong internal cohesion - with tough rules for marriage and sexual relations.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
  \- The Yazidic society is not a sect, but still has some sect-like qualities. It is a religious system where the population is divided into different groups, higher and lower. Besides not being allowed to marry someone who is not a believer in Yazidis, you are also not allowed to marry vertically, ie with any Yazidis under or over their own religious group, says Nemam Ghafouri.  
   
   When IS began its genocide in 2014 and took Yazid women as slaves, it was initially unclear how Yazid society would view women who were raped by IS men and then returned. The custom of upholding family honorary through demanding social norms is common, and sexual relations outside the Yazidic group are not allowed. Even if you have been raped, you can be seen as unclean.  
   
 But in 2015, the Yazid religious leaders wrote a statement specifically about the women who were held captive and exploited by IS terrorists. They would not be ostracized, the leaders said, but welcomed back and regarded as clean.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; \- But they missed one thing: The kids. No one thought it would go so far that the women and girls would stay with IS for so long that they could come back with children, says Nemam Ghafouri.  
&gt;  
&gt; Therefore, Widad Davood's niece hid in the al-Hol camp when her aunt sought her and other Yazidis. She couldn't imagine being separated from her little child.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; When the day is over, Meluk and Widad remove their dusty niqabs. They wandered for hours, around the camp - but are forced to realize that they have found nothing. Widad, who hoped to bring her son Rezan back, is in despair when she alone travels back across the border to the Iraqi side  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; We are back on the Iraqi side, among the Yazidis in the Rwanga refugee camp. It's breaking time in one of the barracks. Two brothers, eight and nine years old, have been granted quota refugee places to Australia.  
 .  
 The brothers are called Izet and Serbast. Their father was killed by IS, and their mother was taken as a slave. The brothers were also slaves for several years, with a Turkish family. They had to clean and wash and do other household chores. For three years they were separated from their mother, who was imprisoned in another part of IS called caliphate.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; During the years of captivity, the brothers forgot about their native language kurmanji, which is a Kurdish dialect. When they returned, they spoke only the language of the slaveholders: Turkish and Arabic.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; Now the boys are sitting on the floor, next to each other, smiling gently in each Nike hoodie. They know nothing about Australia, only that it is far away and that they will learn English and go to school there.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; \- I think it will go well for them in Australia. They are still so young. They also do not have that extinguished look that I see in some, says Nemam Ghafouri.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; There is much buzz about quota refugee places in the camp. France has promised to receive a few hundred Yazidis. But there are women who have been caught at IS who do not want to go to France, because they have heard that there are many Arabs and Muslims living there. IS has murdered their men and enslaved and raped them themselves - all in the name of Islam. In the new country they do not want to be reminded of their ancient oppressors, they do not want to see mosques and hear prayer calls.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; Nemam Ghafouri wants more countries to receive Yazid quota refugees. She is upset that those who survived IS terror are forced to live with their traumas in unfortunate conditions in refugee camps, while IS terrorists themselves often manage to return to Europe and live freely there.

&gt;Croatia Teachers Widen Strike in Demand for Higher Wages

&gt;By¬†The Associated Press

&gt;Nov. 19, 2019

ZAGRE&gt;B, Crota ‚Äî Croatian teachers are widening an ongoing strike, making it nationwide in their demand for higher wages.
The strike has been held partially since last month, with classes halted in certain municipalities on particular days. Unions said Tuesday they are now launching a nationwide strike and that they also plan street protests.
One of the leaders, Branimir Mihalinec, said that more than 90% of teachers and other education employees have joined the strike. He called it ‚Äúa struggle for dignity and (social) status.‚Äù
Croatian teachers say that their salaries lag behind other state employees.

M235ix yeah.

 

&gt;While the two cars are obviously worlds apart, my point is that both are driven at the same speeds on the same potholed roads.

My issue is here you can get holes so big and deep entire wheel of your XK would go in. That's extreme case (and obviously you wouldn't willingly drive in such a hole) but you can easily crack a rim in a lot of them. Friend of mine had great-looking factory rims on his CLA AMG, 20"" with orange ... um, rim around it if you know the ones. Drove into a puddle which happened to hide a pothole, managed to shatter it into like 5 pieces. I myself had a tyre completely fucked up too, although rim somehow survived. Both happened in middle of a large city on high-volume roads (and at least I had nowhere else to go when I spotted it, and wasn't going quickly either).

My point is in winter here you're effectively driving on a minefield, plus some roads in general are spine-shattering even in something like 7 Series or S Class. It gets better every year though, and at least newer roads tend to be more durable from my experience...

&gt; The Sorento is actually quite comfy, and even at 150k miles it's been reliable and surprisingly rattle-free.

The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people. Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government.

&gt;
On 17th August 2010, in the home of the injured party [name given] in Enkoping, Assange 
deliberately consummated sexual intercourse with her by improperly exploiting that she, due to sleep, was in a helpless state. 
It is an aggravating circumstance that Assange, who was aware that it was the expressed wish 
of the injured party and a prerequisite of sexual intercourse that a condom be used, still 
consummated unprotected sexual intercourse with her. The sexual act was designed to violate the injured party‚Äôs sexual integrity.

What country are you from again? Ohh, don't bother. I looked at your post history and you are from the UK. Let's have a look at what a UK judge thinks of the fourth charge.

This is from Julian's extradition hearing in 2011.   Senior District Judge (Chief Magistrate) Howard Riddle, in his decision, wrote the following.

&gt;
The position with offence 4 is different. This is an allegation of rape. The framework list is ticked for rape. The defence accepts that normally the ticking of a framework list offence box on an EAW would require very little analysis by the court. ****However they [the defence] then developed a sophisticated argument that the conduct alleged here would not amount to rape in most European countries.**** However, what is alleged here is that Mr Assange ""deliberately consummated sexual intercourse with her by improperly exploiting that she, due to sleep, was in a helpless state‚Äù. ****In this country that would amount to rape.****

This decision was in the following years appealed several times. Each time Julian had access to some of the best defence attorneys your country had to offer. Yet Julian lost time and time again.

It will be around 10-15% better than any winter tyre unless we get into really high negative temperatures. However, the second you get into any type of snow, even one that was already plowed and is only on surface, winter tyre will give you 3 to 4 TIMES better performance.

Bottom line is, winter tyre will still be sufficient in dry.

Totally incorrect and just allowed confirmation bias to enter the picture (more than it already does). Handwriting analysis/identification is controversial and I can't remember if it's been debunked or not. And then I could think of others that are silly like using a psychic but that's pedantic since that's obviously not what you meant.

I think the most dangerous thing about eyewitness evidence is that it *seems* so reliable to us as flawed human beings. If you have a completely accurate scientific method of identifying the perpetrator of a crime but it's complex and hard to understand, then it may actually be harder to convince a jury using that evidence than eyewitness accounts. And if we humans could just estimate eyewitness evidence accurately, it could still be a decent component of evidence because the jury would be correctly skeptical.

If I'm ever on trial for a crime, heaven forbid, I would seriously consider forgoing the jury unless they'd be sympathetic. Otherwise it's an absolute crapshoot. The jury system itself is something we unquestionably adhere to because the demigods that created our country found the jury system reliable and important.

Ignoring the fact that this is an incredibly simplistic description of how sanctions work, which I've come to expect from nation that often finds its own institutions and government officials subject to them, yes.

Its the sovereign right of any nation on earth to conduct any business it wants with any Iranian actor. And if those actors happen to be the ones that are subject to US sanctions its the sovereign right of the US to refuse to do business with them.

&gt; Can you buy russian weapons?

See above.

And the US has had alliances with nations still using Russian equipment for decades, alliances that included keeping certain high values items like Aircraft operational for lack of better alternatives. Prior to Ukrainian and overt Russian involvement in Syria we were even in the process of purchasing Russian helicopters for Afghanistan.

In any case its interesting how you've convinced yourself that US sanctions are the first hurdle to a Baltic nation buying Russian arms.

*A-bluhuhu*, those poor men in the Wehrmacht! The greatest victims in the whole war, let's hold a moment of silence for their sacrifices... ;_;

No, fuck them. 

The suffering in that war is beyond the scope of most anything in human history. We have limited empathy, and I refuse to spend a shred of it on those who pledged themselves to Hitler- at least, not without evidence to demonstrate that *particular individuals* were sabotaging the cause they fought so vigorously for as a whole. If you want to fling shit at me like a chimpanzee for not adding another onto the ""poor Hans"" train that always seems to roll up when the Wehrmacht is discussed, I encourage you to go right on ahead.

&gt; Your Ancestors knew that very well. Instead of just shooting every nazi and soldier, they tried to judge them individually. It did not work in every case, but they surely put a lot of effort in it. Just sad that so many of you guys seem to have completely lost that mindset over time.

No, when we were first there, we had quite the different idea of it, unclouded by the future political distortions. Towns were marched out to the concentration camps that they claimed to have no knowledge of and forced to bury the dead they had profited from, the Morgenthau Plan was created to ensure the whole of Germany recognized that it lost, and down to our [videos on how to behave in the occupation of Germany](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=821R0lGUL6A). To quote it:

&gt; Every German is a potential source of trouble. Therefore, there must be no fraternization with the German people. Fraternization means making friends. The German people are not our friends. [...] However friendly, however sorry, however sick of the Nazi party they may seem, they cannot come back into the civilized fold just by sticking out their hand and saying, ""I'm sorry."" Sorry? Not sorry they caused the war- they're only sorry they lost it! That is the hand that heiled Adolf Hitler. That is the hand that dropped the bombs on defenseless Rotterdam... Brussels... Belgrade. That is the hand that destroyed the cities, villages, and homes of Russia. That is the hand that held a whip over the Polish, Yugoslav, French, and Norwegian slaves. That is the hand that took their food. That is the hand that starved them. That is the hand that murdered, massacred Greeks, Czechs, Jews. That is the hand that killed and crippled American soldiers, sailors, Marines. Don't clasp that hand.

What we ended up doing sidestepped justice entirely in favor of pragmatism. Roosevelt had hard plans for Germany, but he passed away and the office came to Truman, who had in 1941 said, ""If we see that Germany is winning the war, we ought to help Russia; and if that Russia is winning, we ought to help Germany, and in that way let them kill as many as possible."" The Morgenthau inspired great resistance for its role in Nazi propaganda; that was phased out. A general of ours stated, ""There is no choice between being a communist on 1,500 calories a day and a believer in democracy on a thousand,"" and what would become West Germany was suddenly to become a model for why capitalism was the best system versus the Soviets. We wanted to have a German military to oppose the Soviets, so we sowed the seeds of the Clean Wehrmacht Myth and let so many thousands and thousands of brutally capable officers and officials off with slaps on the wrist, if they were ever even brought to trial. We hung the most publically egregious and kept the bureaucracy running with the rest, evacuating talent to promote rocketry and the like even if they'd had thousands of slaves worked to death.

The war unraveled very fast and the Ardennes offensive proved fatal but it's a bit weird to pass French efforts as ""little fight"".

The decision to surrender so quick is debatable but at the end of the day there was no way to win once the German broke through the lines. Fighting on would have meant exposing civil population to German slaughter and it was still too close to ww1 where 1/3 of 18-27 year old men were wiped out in just 4 years. The perspective of losing another generation to war was too pregnant VS will to fight on.

5378,"&gt; The German newspaper Handelsblatt published a front-page interview today with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who spoke to interviewers about Greece‚Äôs economy, migration, and how it has exited the financial crisis.
&gt; 
&gt; Mitsotakis used tough language to describe the current refugee and migrant crisis, which has created an almost unmanageable situation in the country‚Äôs eastern Aegean islands as well as in parts of the mainland.
&gt; 
&gt; The Greek Premier blasted not only Turkey, but Brussels and Eastern EU member states as well, in the broad-based interview.
&gt; 
&gt; The European Union views Greece as ‚Äùconvenient parking for refugees and migrants,‚Äù Mitsotakis said angrily, reiterating that he will not take it anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; The Greek PM said that the situation where certain EU member states take advantage of the Schengen Area and the freedom of movement for EU citizens ‚Äî but refuse to share the burden of refugees and migrants ‚Äî has to end.
&gt; 
&gt; Mitsotakis referred to a certain group of Eastern EU members, such as Poland, Hungary and others, which continue to categorically refuse to comply with EU law and receive their share of Greece‚Äôs and Italy‚Äôs migrant populations.
&gt; 
&gt; The Greek premier also voiced his anger at Turkey, charging that Ankara uses refugees and migrants as leverage to force Europe to make concessions.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄùI have said very clearly to President Erdogan that he cannot exploit immigrants and refugees if he wants to have good neighborly relations with Greece,‚Äù Mitsotakis told the German daily.
&gt; 
&gt; The Greek PM gave an example, saying that Greece has recently been trying to communicate with the Turkish Coast Guard each time FRONTEX or Greece‚Äôs Coast Guard spots a dinghy coming toward Greece. ‚ÄùThere is no reaction on their part; this is unacceptable,‚Äù Mitsotakis said.
&gt; 
&gt; The Greek Premier said that it is time for a European solution on the issue, reiterating his agreement with the German Interior Minister‚Äôs proposals for the reform of the European Asylum process and the ‚ÄùDublin Regulation.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; According to these proposals, asylum seekers will be able to begin the application process in countries outside the EU and will then be able to finish it in any EU member state, rather than being obliged to do it in the nation of their entrance, which is normally either Greece or Italy.
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, the Greek government is planning to create at least six new enclosed migrant camps on islands as well as on the mainland of the country.
&gt; 
&gt; Economy
&gt; 
&gt; Prime Minister Mitsotakis also declared that Greece is no longer a state in need which asks for help but a ‚Äùa country that participates on a level playing field on major European and global issues.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; He referred to the positive signals coming from the economy, mentioned the rise in investors‚Äô interest in Greece, and noted that his administration is a rare example of a government which has already implemented more than it had promised to do before the elections.
&gt; 
&gt; Mitsotakis also stated that Greece is now the West‚Äôs line of defense against populism, noting that in the last general elections ‚Äúwe defeated both the left populists and the far-right Golden Dawn extremists.‚Äù

5400,"Well this comment (and your previous comments as well...in fact your general stance and reasoning on the issue) only proves that you have no clue about the things you're talking about, but that doesn't seem to stop you from talking a lot. Your entire stance just reeks of ""Serbia bad, I heard it repeatedly on BBC so it's the truth"". Sprinkle a bit of classic r/europe propaganda and there you have it. Your average westerner's opinion on the Kosovo conflict.

You took down your dictator without bloodshed. Big fucking deal. We took down Milosevic as well. I don't see how taking down a dictator is in any way, shape or form comparable to the Kosovo issue. Seriously, enlighten me.

This issue is a political deadlock. The Serbs don't want to recognize Kosovo for a multitude of reasons, some of them being:

 Kosovo being a de jure part of Serbia and Serbia not wanting to compromise its territorial integrity,  Kosovo being defined in the Serbian constitution as a part of Serbia, thus anyone wanting to change it without a referendum would have to commit high treason (very likely to happen in the near future btw, look it up),not wanting to give legitimacy to Albanian terrorists (no, I'm not just using that word, the KLA was marked as a  terrorist organization even by the US, their own fucking ally), not wanting to give legitimacy to an illegal US bombing campaign and the civilian deaths that followed due to that, not wanting to give legitimacy to a UN resolution being broken by the Kosovars, not wanting to give legitimacy to the pogrom of 2004, not wanting to set a bad precedent for further fragmentation of an already critically unstable region (look at North Macedonia's demographics and recent political developments regarding Albanians. It's basically Kosovo 2.0 in the making), not wanting to give legitimacy to the hundreds of thousands of expelled and ethically cleansed Serbs both during and after the war, not wanting to forsake the few Serbs left living there and probably a bunch more reasons i can't think of right now. This is just off the top of my head.

On the other side, you have the Kosovar Albanians who now de facto have their own 95%+ Albanian country and will never submit to Serbia willingly again, as they've obviously been severely mistreated in the 90s. As for your ""occupation"" argument that you made in a few different comments, what was the US intervention if not a direct invasion and occupation? They invaded and bombed the country into submission, seizing a large part of land and building a massive military base on it. Just because they didn't occupy the territory for themselves doesn't make it any less of an occupation. So that argument falls apart as well. Face it, your stance is hypocritical at best.

The issue can be solved without bloodshed, as you said, but not with our desired outcome. So while your statement is technically correct, I don't think you really understood what the other guy meant. He clearly meant that Kosovo will not be a part of Serbia again without bloodshed, as the Albanians will never willingly submit (i don't think I have to say that I don't condone this, but you've been making generalizations galore, so i guess i will anyway). I don't condone this. Now yes, it can be solved without bloodshed if Serbia just recognizes it, and with the developments regarding our treacherous cunt of a president, that's looking more and more likely by the minute.",,/r/europe/comments/dyk8t0/uefa_must_punish_england_fans_for_racism_brutal/f83b56z/,Moist_Breakfast,1574208298

5408,"&gt; Thing is, most buyers don't choose between a Estate and SUV in the same size category, the SUV is usually from a smaller size category.

Well I can neither deny nor confirm that but based on the SUVs and Cars I see mostly it doesnt seem to be right tho at least for Germany.

2018 Audi top sellers: A4, A3, Q5, A6, Q3, A5, Q2, A1

2018 BMW top sellers: 1, 5, 2, 3, x1, x3, 4, x5, i3

So cars still outsell SUVs and I doubt the average Q5 buyer would have bought an A6 otherweise. The Q5 is rather small (smaller than an A4)

Pricewise they even out pretty fast as the more expensive SUVs come with bigger engines and better base features.

The E350d I configured was at 91k at the end, the GLE 350d at 96k. Id consider that a pretty small gap.",,/r/europe/comments/dyl1pl/one_in_three_cars_sold_in_europe_is_an_suv_suvs/f83bgyk/,unfriendlyredditor,1574208502

5468,"&gt; Portuguese goods are not taxed very highly here in the US

Because the US has a libertarian approach and doesn't want to tax higher. Yet it is &gt;0%, unlike the taxes Amazon, Facebook or Google pays here.

 &gt; Just as US goods shipped to Portugal are not taxed highly either

Are not whaaa? 30% on customs, 23% VAT on top of the total if it is for sale, and income tax on the company who sells it. It can easily double the product cost on taxes alone unless you're importing on your own.

But my point is, it doesn't matter what the tax value is, each country decides on its taxes, and dodging them is not cool. We need to pay 23% VAT to let the government fund a certain amount of public infrastructure, but we could instead pay like 15% (number out of the ass) if it wasn't for tax dodgers.

Yeah, things sold by the current dodgers would get 15% more expensive, but isn't that like a positive tradeoff overall?

5519,"&gt;We paid just over 23k USD for a new Crosstrek

Ah, OK. That's for starters because you're in US market which is simply done by this point. You only get SUVs and crossovers there, so yeah in your market it might be indeed best option... but only because your market doesn't have the good option in first place. Also quite honestly I have no clue why you insist on AWD considering it's just 152 BHP engine - it will give you minimal gain in some situations, but you'd still be better just getting set of good winter tyres and swapping them in when it starts getting to around 5-7\*C outside. Another 'fun fact' is here for a price of 1.6 Subaru XV (that's what Crosstrek is called here, and no we don't get the 2.0 at all) you could get well speced BMW 1 series this year (since they were getting rid of tail-end of production before new one got introduced).

&gt; People for the most part just want a vehicle to get them from a to b in comfort without guzzling gas and the crossover ticks a lot boxes for those people. It's time to accept that these vehicles are dominating the market for good reason. 

I have no issue with utilitarian car, crossovers aren't them though. Even if we ignore issue of comfort, which I don't see being better in any shape or form (in fact the opposite), the whole point is they &gt;are&lt; guzzling gas. If you took your Crosstreck, dropped it down couple centemeters and cut like 5 cm from the top you'd literally save around 10-15% of gas. It's simple physics - the larger crossection, the higher drag, the more energy you're wasting.

Yes, if you compare them to some old car the crossover of 2019 is actually more efficient than 'normal car' of 1999 or even 2009. However that's not because it's crossover, but rather despite being crossover and wasting a lot of the gains from increased ICE efficiency. I mean, we're wasting some of that efficiency for other things too - for example modern cars are significantly heavier regardless of form factor. That's because a lot of that weight goes into safety features, but that's a trade-off worth having. Trading it for absolutely no gain is just idiotic.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/dyl1pl/one_in_three_cars_sold_in_europe_is_an_suv_suvs/f82zew9/,Fresherty,1574201185

5563,"Yes. Daladier went along with it but thought he would get crucified at home.

The record of the event as told by each side agrees that a) Chamberlain was eager to pressure Czechoslovakia into giving up the Sudetenland if he could get assurances from Hitler that this would be the end of his territorial demands and 

b) that he showed no signs of discomfort at the idea until he found out that Hitler demanded that all property, even private property of people displaced by the occupation remain where it is and that this expropriation would not be compensated. This apparently shook him, but not enough to go through with it

Then of course we have testimony from Benesh regarding his experience. He mentioned being disappointed in France as they failed to live up to promises maid but was appalled by Chamberlain who allegedly flat out told him that if there is a war that starts because of Czechoslovakia, the UK will make sure that all German claims on the country are recognized in the subsequent peace. Essentially threatening to give all of Czechia to Hitler if he tries to put up a fight.

Finally, we have the post conference attitudes of the Allies. Daladier felt defeated and was horrified, rather than relieved when he saw the Conference way received without protest. He saw then that his country had no appetite for war and realized just how badly he had failed his country. France would pay for that mistake and isn't allowed to ever forget it.

Chamberlain of course was quickly cured of any misgivings and had an air of elation around him.

5585,"&gt;The difference between 2005 and 2015 is that in 2015 there was a massive outrage from PO

First off, you‚Äôre wrong, because there was no massive outrage from the opposition at the news of loss to PiS, but at news about breaking the constitution and subjugating the constitutional tribunal. Worries which the European Court of Justice confirmed. You‚Äôre being intellectually dishonest and you know it

Secondly, there was no difference in reaction between 2015 and 2005, because there was as much ‚ÄúPiS-scare‚Äù in 2005-2007 as there was in 2015. This PiS-scare was actually a reason that PiS lost so hard in 2007, it mobilized the electorate of PO a lot. You‚Äôre either very young or, again, intellectually dishonest

Thirdly, I don‚Äôt see a reason why anyone would view the entire apparatus of the European Union as some sort of slave boy to PO?? That‚Äôs a very weird line of reasoning. Typical PiS-voter argument though

&gt;so they complained about their own country to the EU

Yes, because there were breaches of the constitution. Very clear breaches that were obvious to everyone, including everyone in the European Union. Just not to PiS and their supporters - very (un)conveniently

&gt;And actually in 2005 PiS and PO were very similar

What a horseload of bullshit. Try reading their political programmes from 2005 and quit this intellectual dishonesty. PiS was this typical pro-social nationally-Catholic party while PO was a very liberal free-market and pro-European party

&gt;And in 2005-2007 PiS couldn‚Äôt really do much because they had a minority government

Nope, they were governing in a coalition and had done plenty of wrong with Minister Ziobro on the merged position of Prosecutor General and Head of Justice at the same time, and they also subjugated TVP in their own style and suited it to become their propaganda machine in a similar way to what we have now.

Away matches of Ajax regularly have chants suggesting ""All Jews should be gassed"" ([Link voor de Nederlanders](https://youtu.be/zR-TgCeNr04?t=51)) and ""My parents were in the SS and they burned Jews"" ([Link voor de Nederlanders)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75J1qZMQhE0).

Still this case is highly irregular, the fact that the first prosecutor dropped it, and another prosecutor picked picked it up without a request from the victims nor new evidence does not sit well with me. The prosecutor refused to press charges for 10 years because they wanted an interview in Sweden, when it is actually common practice to conduct interviews in foreign Embassies with a prosecutor or via Skype. Then said prosecutor actually came to the UK for a deposition with the UK High Court (yeeears ago) about Assange's appeal but refused to walk to the Swedish Embassy with him and make the interview happen (he offered,the prosecutor refused). And now that they have him, they are claiming it's too late for evidence. Why wasn't it late for evidence 1 year, 2 years, 3 years ago? I wonder what changed...^(/s) And this is just what I remember now. There were so many red flags in this investigation it was ridiculous. I've forgotten most of it by now.

*The party's ideological position is set out in a manifesto from 2014. It proposes that a socialistic society of the future ""neither can nor should be described in detail, but rather be developed and shaped by the people living in it"". It describes socialism as ""an answer to the problems caused by capitalism such as non-sufficient democracy, crises, destruction of nature, inequality, racism and war"".*

*About the economic system it says:*

*""A new and actually democratic system of society requires fundamental changes in the ownership of the means of production, such as companies, land and natural resources. Collective forms of ownership will be dominating. We propose that public authorities, co-workers, local communities and other collectives of persons should own and run institutions and companies. \[...\] A democratic economy means a democratic work life as well. The work place should be characterized by democracy, and the employees must have a constitutional right to decisive influence on the organization of work in the workplace.""*

*The methods advocated for achieving this may be different, depending on the course of class struggle, but will eventually require a revolution - one that must be supported by a majority of the population manifested through democratic and free elections.*",Romania,/r/europe/comments/dynaun/corrected_map_of_countries_with_neonazi_and/f829a08/,InfiltratedAlien,1574186677

5709,"Intersting video. It does capture the general idea, I guess.

Of course, this is just a quick and dirty illustration. IRL, specially with this sort of monies, one does not jump to numerical resulution *on the go* all while building the model.

There are of course a few uniquely American assumptions in there.

1/ That you can't charge the investments to customers. Probably varies from countries to countries. Should be discussed further and not brushed aside as an immutable fact. Laws can change, specially considering the climate emergency.

2/ The USA are a producer of gas. With fracking, they even currently have an *overproduction* of gas. Most of the gas we burn in the EU comes from elsewhere, with added financial costs but also diplomatic costs (Hello, Russia).

3/ Here it is assumed that the plants are built by private, for-profit companies operating in a competitive market. At the moment, things are about the same here in the EU, although with a long history of state-owned utilities. This may change fast, which bring us to ...

4/ The huge upfront investments are financed on the *private* money market. Interest rates are much lower when the borrower is a state

5/ Climate change is considered has having no monetary incidence, which IRL is not the case. That carbon taxes, in one form or another, are bound to rise a lot in the next 40 years would seem a reasonable assumption.

6/ The Europeans politicians are, as a whole, much more climate-conscious that their American counterparts, and much less in cahoot with the fossil fuels industries

Also, valid on both sides of the Atlantic is the fact that the availbility of fossil fuels over the next 40 years is far from certain. I understand that Poland still has sizable reserves of coal, which makes the Polish equation apart from the continental equation.

At any rate, the *zeitgeist* is that energy, though commending the whole economy, cannot any longer be confined to the realm of economics.

The vast majority don't bother voting, no one gives a shit. Turnout in the poorest parts of the countries is super low. around 40%. So your ""en masse"" seems quite ridiculous. 

But hey my bad let's look at what Klaus is proposing for the **45%** of Romanians that still live in the country side.

https://iohannis.ro/program/


What are the titles of the chapters of his programme?

* 1) Foundations on which to build a Normal Romania

* 2) The state in the service of the citizen: rebuilding the faith in the insitutions

* 3) The laws of Romania: guaranteeing the state of law 

* 4) Sustainable Romania: Promoting education, health and social solidarity

* 5) Prosperous and predictible Romania: consolidating entrepreneurship in Romania

* 6) Competitive Romania: fixing discrepancies through strategy and inteligent policies

* 7) Connected Romania: Developping infrastructire and digitization

* 8) European Romania: Increasing the benefist of EU integration

* 9) Strong Romania: Increasing durable partnerships


So again **45%** of Romanians live in the country side. **27%** of Romanian shit outside. 

Yet from 8 chapters: one's about entrepreneurs, one's about more fiber optics. Where's the chapter about fucking farmers? How many entrepreneurs does Romania have vs farmers? 

Where's the chapter about building fucking plumbing? Nope. You get fiber optics but no plumbing and running water. 

He only talks about farmers in chapter about Competitive Romania. After he talks about auto industry, IT and energy. 

Fucking farmers, the majority being subsistance farmers that **barely** make ends meet don't give a shit about IT innovation. The still live in the middle ages.

5814,"Macron doesn't really need to 'turn France around' for Europe to have an alternative to Nato. Whatever his domestic policies need to be is neither here nor there, in this context. Also, you make it sound as though France is on the precipice somehow when really they need some reforms in the workforce and that's difficult but not exactly a crisis.

What Europe needs is a country with more or less coherent and predictable foreign policy. Whatever you may think of Hollande, in broad strokes it hasn't been terrible foreign policy, continuing the German French tight partnership, not openly questioning Nato, not undermining French or indeed EU interests in favor of whatever Putin wants, not trying to leave the EU, and being part of the Iran deal, the Paris accord. 
I'm sure there were also bad moments in foreign policy, and I'm sure people will be eager to point that out, but what I'm saying is that (and it used to be that way in the US in the 20th century also) usually presidents just pick up where the other left off, regardless of party affiliation.

Would Le Pen or Melenchon do the same? Maybe, maybe not. The way I see it, with the way the french presidential elections are structured, fringe parties have very little chance of gaining the power anyway and centrist, albeit slightly left or right will usually win, and will usually have the same goals with continuing the same work. 
After all, left or right they all claim to be Gaulists and want a sort of French sphere of influence in the world. Whether that's delusional or not doesn't even matter, at least it's always the same.
And if the EU wants to build some kind of army to one day be a replacement or alternative to nato, I think we could do worse than a predictable and slightly arrogant French leadership role.

5967,"&gt;I think that if he wanted to live in Germany there a good chance that he would move to Germany, find work in Germany, apply for residency in Germany, became a member of German society etc.

I'm sure he could do, but again, the point here is that his family had to leave Germany, were subject to violence and had their citizenship stripped. He could live in Germany, but more to the point, if that hadn't have happened, he'd be living in Germany now.. 

&gt;No, I implied that granting German citizenship should be dependent on wanting to live in Germany.

So no to the children of Germans living abroad if they or their parents don't want to move back to Germany?

&gt;edit: and not just German citizenship, it applies to any citizenship.

Clearly not as different countries have very different rules depending on a slew of historical considerations and traditions.

The outcome is that now every day or every second day bears are in the news- they attacked households, domestic animals, people (a guy nearby was killed last week, a month ago a guy went fishing and they found him without his face and his arm after a bear killed him), this is the third day in a row when a bear has been hit and killed by a car in my region.
