0,"&gt;We (as consumers) need to be demanding high quality stuff from new retailers as well,

There are plenty of furniture makers, carpenters and high quality furniture out there, but it's expensive as fuck. My father bought a table for more than 2 000 dollars 30 years ago because it was made by a carpenter by real materials (he knew the carpenter so he got a lower price). You can do the same but you don't want that, you want IKEA prices with carpenter quality.

Take Brexit for example, they actually managed to convince a good chunk of the populace that it was another country that influenced their decision. As if that other country made them a bastion of Euro sceptiscm since the 80's and at every move they had to be more integrated with the EU, from Schengen or the currency union, they reject it. Many have even forgotten that it was their own politicians that were beating the anti Euro drumbeat and that it was their own prime minister that actually called for a referendum and that it's actually the current sitting Prime Minister who marched as leader of a Brexit campaign to get the UK out.

62,"&gt;congrats on not understanding a iota of the history of the EU, its purpose and its values.

I know it didnt literally start as an economic union, I just think thats one reason why an EU membership is very attractive nowadays. the literal start of the ECSC was a peace project, there is a huge clue in the name.....

also the fact that it is an economic union now reduces the chance of war even further.

&gt;except that the EU works with the 40k staff, that of a medium sized european city, so you have to be quite biased to say that it's a behemoth.

just because they don't have a whole lot of staff for a similar sized organization does not mean they can't and shouldn't look over their expenses, also did you miss the Reuters article I linked? 

&gt;Respect local cultures? 

eg. the fact that there were thoughts about a refugee quota system is beyond ridiculous, I believe that is absolutely non of EUs business, it is disrespectful to nations, citizens from more homogeneous cultures, a lot of people in my home country was upset over that, the Dublin Regulation not being enforced and abuse by the Schengen area is


&gt;To avoid abuses, European law, the Dublin Regulation, requires that asylum seekers have their asylum claim registered in the first country they arrive in,[4] and that the decision of the first EU country they apply in, is the final decision in all EU countries. However, among some asylum seekers, the fingerprinting and registration is vehemently resisted in countries that are not considered asylum-seeker friendly, as they often wish to apply for asylum in Germany and Sweden where benefits are more generous.[5]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_shopping

&gt;which means having more laws and more pooling of powers in areas such as foreign policy and defence, thus contradicting your claim that the EU should slim down on costs and laws.


Im gonna quote myself for this one:

&gt;imo EU should slim down costs, slim down on laws, respect local cultures and laws as well as become an official military alliance, have less powers in some places

I believe some laws are needed to keep up the ""rules"" of the economic union, but overall, laws should be made more locally.

it is not impossible to make a military alliance on the same time you reduce expenditure, it's not some EU army, its just an alliance, IMO NATO critical american republicans are a threat for EU.

&gt; To him that was a clear sign that the only way to collectivism (his Marxist ideal) was under the powerful sentiment of nationalism (which is 100% evident even today - just watch any Olympic games, any major international sports event, etc, to see how people react when their country wins). 

Are you sure you are thinking of correct terminology? It is rather well known that in Marx's works he differienated between the application of collectivism in the workforce and individualism in personal space. Marxism isn't just collectivism above everything. 

&gt; He became, thus, an ultranationalist socialist and was subsequently ousted from the Italian Socialist party that was controlled directly from Moscow (just like any other far-left communist party in Europe). 

Ummm... he was thrown out of PSI during WWI time, not after. And during that time the Moscovite regime not only was allied to Italy, but also ruled through the tsarist strongmen, so I'm not sure what business would they have to monetarily support an antithetical to their rule party to sabotage Italian war efforts... I think you are severely mistaken here. Plus, the Internationale split from the Soviets later in the 20s, so not every leftist party in Europe was a puppet party ruled from Moscow. Quite the contrary, the local socialist movements were much stronger than soviet attempts to meddle in western politics. Spartakus League was strongly anti-soviets, antifascistas too, not to mention CNT-FAI, which led a domestic political plan independently from Moscow. Soviet puppet parties were really only successful in Baltic States, where SU eventually took over.

&gt; Ultranationalist vs internationalist socialism was the new playing field in those days. 

Not quite. In this particular instance, sure. But the so called leftist infighting ecompassed much more, from individual rights, to economic plans, to an issues of liberty and the so called vanguardism. Mussolinist fascism became a third way ideology strictly because it abandoned all core values that characterized socialist movements, while still being in a heavy opposition to capitalism that was seen in US and UK. Hence the name - finding an independent path to introduce a new system that isn't either socialism or capitalism, per se. Most fascist regimes used corporatism here to their advantage, while also not allowing any independent actions from the said corp. That was the most benefitial to them.

&gt; No sane (or insane) leader wanted Russia influencing their domestic affairs so everyone hunted down or at least kept a very close eye on socialist movements. 

Again, that wasn't the problem until the Cold War - where the West saw a rise of socialdemocratic parties - a clear opposition to Soviets and a way to avoid suppression from the mother state (due to socialist parties ban).

&gt; At the end of the day though we have to realize that that left - right dichotomy is a false one. They are both statist and hence authoritarian. 

That's an interesting statement. It's rather incorrect, considering we have dozens of socialist and rightist ideologies that value individualism well over the existence of a state that dictates the rulings. Hell, anarchism was born out of socialist thought - and they are a clear antithesis to statism. While the left-right divide is not the best visualisation of political landscape, the statement that all of them are statist is incorrect.

&gt; In the end the real dichotomy and the one any educated citizen should keep in mind is the authoritarian central planners vs classical liberals. 

The so called classical liberals aren't the sole opposition to ""authoritarian central planning"", as you describe it. I'm also fairly certain classical liberals are on average ok with central planning, if it's the private companies that are leading the efforts. Though in my personal belief, in such a system, such corporations will eventually replace the government, while not exactly being the said government - just simply being a puppet master behind the scene.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The former favor the growth of bureaucracy and “red tape” costs via issuing debt (sovereign) whereas the later favor an economy which is based on freedom, savings and, from those savings, investments. 

That's your division. Mutualism also argues for personal freedom, but without the capitalist system, which they think dictates their way of life. 

&gt; The first one slips towards an unfree, tyrannical, authoritarianism while the second becomes a real democracy where citizens vote EVERYDAY with their feet 

Are you perhaps familiar with the term ""late capitalism"" or ""capitalist dystopia""? In both of those situations the said private companies grow in size and overtake the leading national government. The lesson is quite clear here - you shouldn't slip into the far ends of the said economic systems.

I'm not a market socialist for no reason. If I were to not see the dangers of such a system you propose, I'd probably be on your side.

105,"It's trickier. Our escu correspond to that Latin - iscus, but also corresponds to roma(Gipsy) - esko and also from some thracian roots - isk. All 3 versions means same thing, to belong to something similar to the Slavonic sin, son of aka belong to my dad.

Another problem is that the germanic, Italian equivalents in this case (the to belong way) are the von so metin in German and de something in Italian. Andrea de Pisa as an example would be a good correspondent for Basescu since basescu come from a village or town and it's added that escu.

Your link is a brittle wrong because they want to show the Latin roots ignoring the fact that the romanization/latinization (mostly by French word) started a bit later literary speaking. Before the escu trendind there was still some latinization but by other ways, via neogreek (the fanariot were speaking French as a lingua franca at the court, imported some French word), via polish and via Russian. So those 3 imported French words and we imported from them.

Another problem is that we took it more phonetically rather than by its meaning. I will use the English word car since I suck at French and I don't know some French examples right now. 
The English car means mașină(automobile) while we had the word car and căruță(vehicle with horses, cows, donkeys etc used for traction) for which the English equivalent would be cart. So we imported the English car as a equivalent even tho the corresponding word would be cart because it's similar phonetically, but it's still different in meaning.
Same way some think our escu comes from iscus which would actually mean something like Ion de la Prut instead of Ion Pruteanu and not son of Prut. Prut îs not really a good example, but it's an object similar to the bas+escu.

All in all that escu might come from 3 similar roots and 1 a little different from the first 3. 3 roots of ""belong to""(Latin iscus, thracian isk and gipsy/roma esko"" and 1 root of son of (Slavonic sin).
There are not so many infos available and what is out the tries to focus on the Latin root even tho we have another and a better root while also ignoring 1 equivalent root to the Latin one, the gipsy/Roma root which is also Indo-European, and - to be honest--Gipsy esko sounds closer tu escu that iscus which some people cannot accept.",,/r/europe/comments/i3k8uu/former_ro_president_basescu_ready_to_run_for/g0fbmij/,SadSonJack,1596617279

123,"I also want to point out that many people immigrate to the US becuase of those parallel communities. When I immigrated from Taiwan, we initially went to the US because my grandparents were able to live a full life there, despite only speaking Chinese and Taiwanese. They could get government services, go to the bank, go to a Chinese supermarket, temple. The Korean restaurants would have Chinese menus and vis versa, if they got sick they could find a Chinese speaking doctor,  and were much less of a minority.

We tried out Germany and unfortunately both my parents (English and basic German speaking, but with an accent) and grandparents faced quite a bit of racism there, and eventually they moved back to the States to get away from the racists they would meet in day to day life. The existence of those societies is what made my parents choose the States, and now Canada as they're getting older and want a quieter life.

I don't think it's all bad though. Koreans, Japanese, and Chinese people tend to hate each other in our home countries.   But we actually tend to get along very well in the US. 

Even here in Norway the few Chinese and Japanese immigrants here are often spouting racist shit about each other and it's very socially accepted to do so. I'm a 1/8 Japanese guy from a mostly ethnic Chinese ex-Japanese colony, who also grew up in Japan. So I'm just awkwardly stuck in the middle of that as both sides insult part of my heritage while insisting that I'm a part of them instead. I think most of the Chinese and Japanese I encounter here are only living in Norway for work or study though, rather than planning to stay long term, so that might be a huge contributing factor in the lack assimilation on their parts. 

In contrast, when I was living in the States, we even went as far as celebrating our biggest festival together in a sort of pan-East Asian Midsummer/Chuseok/Tsukimi.

I think it just comes down to differing ideas of assimilation and I'm not sure which is necessarily better. Separate cultures sharing ideas with each other and creating a society that is a mix of all those cultures vs becoming fully a part of the majority culture. Both could lead to acceptance, but the first option seems to be a lot harder to implement and as we can observe with the United States, can also have disastrous results.

Das stimmt auch nicht.“ Der Anwalt der „B.Z.“ sagte, als formal vollständige Neugründung sei die Linke nicht berechtigt, im Namen ihrer diversen Vorgängerparteien zu sprechen. Zum Verschieben von Parteivermögen, das laut einer Unabhängigen Untersuchungskommission in großem Stil stattgefunden haben soll, könnten sich daher nur Privatpersonen wie Bisky und Gysi äußern, die damals in der Partei Verantwortung trugen.
Um das Argument zu kontern, legte Schatzmeister Holluba die Versicherung vor. Das bedeutet, dass die Linke künftig auch Aussagen wie „SED-Chef Honecker war ein Mauermörder“ oder „Ulbricht hat die SPD in die SED gezwungen“ rechtlich angreifen könnte. In der Sprache der Juristen ist die Partei dazu „aktiv legitimiert“. Die „B.Z.“ hat den Prozess verloren. ",North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany),/r/europe/comments/i3gf7p/nearly_half_of_germans_support_withdrawal_of_us/g0f4qhq/,eip2yoxu,1596610320

Owners of the big, more efficient farms should buy the land from small farmers and make this transition easier for them and their children.

309,"&gt;On July 1, Belarus’ ambassador to Russia, Vladimir Semashko, unveiled several details regarding Russia’s integration offers. Chief among these was the startling suggestion that Belarus transfer as much as 95 percent of its power to the supranational level, that is, the Union State, in a particularly blunt show of disregard for Belarus’ sovereignty. Provided that this information is true, Lukashenko’s departure from the negotiating table at Sochi in early December 2019 can hardly come as a surprise.

https://eng.belta.by/economics/view/belarus-ambassador-unveils-details-of-russias-integration-offers-131436-2020/

&gt; When asked whether deeper integration is possible without compromising the sovereignty, Vladimir Semashko noted that the transfer of powers to the supranational level should be ‘reasonable and not at the expense of sovereignty'. “I recall 13 February 2019 when we got the first proposal in Sochi (I will not name the names from the Russian side). When we studied it and forwarded to the president, I told him that it meant sheer capitulation. I do not have another definition for that: they suggested transferring everything to the higher level leaving us with very little decision-making, like the name of the police. It should not be like that,” the ambassador said. 
&gt;
&gt; Vladimir Semashko cited the European Union as a case in point. “After analyzing national and supranational functions I have come to the conclusion that only 18% of functions there were transferred to the supranational level; the national governments retained all the other functions. The document we received on 13 February 2019 provided that 95% of functions should be supranational,” he noted. 

Huh, I missed it when they released that statement.  I'm pretty sure that by most sane metrics, a lot less than 95% of authority is at the central level in most *federations*.

321,"Do you see how this feeds into the idea that there is such a thing as LGBT Ideology, distinct from having sexual or personality traits outside of the standard model? You're proposing that people have a certain duty, to take a certain action, which is different from the Western/Anglosphere standard of ""don't take actions which harm others."" You're instead proposing that some opinions (which are not pleasant opinions, and with which I disagree) should be proscribed, lest those opinions gain any purchase in as-yet-undecided minds. This cuts directly against a very deeply held and important value from the English Common Law tradition: the freedom to think and speak even those ideas which society at large finds unacceptable.

I don't think it's correct to label it as LGBT Ideology, because it's a descendant of Critical Theory, which is a perverse blend of identitarianism, Marxism, and postmodernist tactics. It's applied in the Sexuality and Gender space, and that's where places like Hungary and Poland are focusing, but it exists in race, sex, nationality, religion, politics, and art, as well.

For Germany, half of us want US troops gone anyway, the other half doesn't care either way - only a few are really against it because US troops brought vital business to their area. As a punitive measure against Germany, it is very ineffective, probably coming from a misguided view that we would be afraid of Russians these days. No, we're afraid that some Chevrolet car dealership will go bankrupt, or some friendships or relationships broken.

Certainly the Iraq war is not an example of American and European interests aligning. Nor is America's stance on Iran or its unwavering support of Netanyahu's government as it flagrantly violates international law. Nor were America's many interventions in South America in alignment with European interests. And in hindsight, nor was America's emboldening of China through PNTR a good thing for Europe.

Well no, I will demand fair treatment, equality and stricter laws in place to protect groups like LGBT people who are targeted by straights and forced back into the closet when possible.

Since China has about 30% of current global emissions, China's total emissions from 1750 to present would move towards 30%, while the US will trend down towards 14%-ish and the EU will trend down toward 9%-ish.

I would say that Myrito's links show that the US and EU will trend even lower and China will trend even higher, since their emissions are decreasing, but I suspect that increasing emissions in other parts of the world may make it so China's share of emissions will actually go down, but I'm I haven't bothered checking total emission projections, that' just a hunch.

&gt; Not even 50 years ago electronic shock therapy was used to torture homosexuals and still to this day trans people are hunted down and brutally murdered for no reason other than some straight has a problem with another human beings genitals and freedom of expression.

The first claim here is true. It's also not relevant to the present day, because we learned (too late to save many great people) that it was harmful to the victims, their families, and society at large. I would love to see evidence that trans people are hunted down and brutally murdered by ""some straight"" who ""has a problem with another human's genitals."" Specifically, in Europe or North America, not in Saudi Arabia. To my knowledge, the danger for trans people is specifically for trans prostitutes, who are perceived to have committed fraud by a John, who then commits a heinous crime.

The thought pattern in which you engage here is catastrophizing, a process where you see an aberrant, abhorrent event, and assume that it is common and an immediate threat to you and yours.

No, not the entire Cold War. 

When America was in the position to do something about Stalin basically annexing a third of Europe, America did nothing. Of course the situation was complicated, but many of America's subsequent actions can't really be said to have been in the best interests of Europe. 'Containing communism' through various interventions, assassinations, and hot wars in the Third World may have made some Europeans feel safe, but only the most conservative of historians would argue that these actions advanced Europe's interests in some concrete sense. 'Being part of NATO' is not 'the entire Cold War.'

&gt; Containing China during the entirety of Obama's presidency (TPP)

Are you making an argument for TPP as if that would have been a good thing for the American and European people? I'm not sure what you're trying to imply in this sentence... And anyway, the only reason China needed containing was because of American PNTR with China.

&gt; Almost any foreign policy towards Russia between 2008 and 2016.

America had a hand in destabilizing Ukraine, so we disagree here as well.

&gt; The Balkan war.

The only intervention in the Bosnian War was from the UN and it was a joke. Their 'safe zones' were no such thing. Their presence was toothless. America's intervention against Serbia in Kosovo some years later was an action taken, in part at least, to amend for their inaction in the former Yugoslavia. I'm sure that much of Europe would have welcomed an American presence from '92 - '95, but it simply wasn't there.

Western Europe seems like it's the final ray of light for us unless the USA dramatically shifts with this new election and turns into at LEAST a centrally political nation not a right wing one... well I suppose canada seems gay friendly, so they exist too thankfully.

Even the UK's right wing party got in, even though tf that party is not actively anti lgbt and working against us...

I think my concerns are valid, I'm noticing a shift and a growing insurgence of anti LGBT propaganda and true dangers for us and I think its morally wrong for straight people who view us as equals to sit back and allow this toxic rhetoric spread. Parents who teach their  children to fear and hate what is different will destroy this planet. 

There is far more important things in the world than what's in someones pants or who they take to bed. Climate change, coronavirus and jobs for young people are the biggest issues right now. But because of humanity my biggest worry are my civil rights, safety and slowly watching the world become more dangerous for me.

420,"&gt; No? When did I say that?

When you said you’d rather have a popularity contest decide your leader than a trained and qualified candidate

&gt; No. I said that democracy is the best system, not that I will support it no matter what. I believe that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights trumps any political system, and that any government that breaches it is illegitimate, regardless of whether they were democratically elected or not.

Where does that declaration of human rights come from?

&gt; Yes

And what have they said? 

&gt; And? Most North Koreans approve of Kim Jong-Un. Dictators have a lot of tools at their disposal to make themselves liked.

Not the ones who leave North Korea. Meanwhile every former Saudi citizen even non Muslims I’ve talked to  have had only positive things about the king 

&gt; That is easily demonstrable as not true. Syria and Iraq are both warzones right now, which makes it an unfair comparison to use them instead of a country like Tunisia or Lebanon. Regardless, outside of the conflict areas Syria and Iraq have not been accused of anything Saudi Arabia hasn't, and even in conflict areas, both have been much more humane than Saudi has been in its ongoing war against Yemen.

That isn’t true. Even when Iraq and Syria weren’t war zones they were far worse. But again after Saddam no one said Iraq should restore the monarchy. The fact is ALL Arab monarchies are better off than secular ones. Let’s say Saudi Arabia becomes a republic tomorrow you think they’d immediately legalize gay marriage?

&gt; I think most westerners who know my standards would say I don't have western standards, so no. If you mean the UDHR, a document which every UN member has signed, yes.

And who wrote the UDHR? And how are your standards not western?

&gt; No, but aligning almost perfectly with Benito Mussolini's essays on fascism does. And Saudi Arabia very much aligns with that.

And how exactly does Saudi Arabia resemble Mussolini? That’s like me saying Germany is communist because they have some similarities to Lenin’s thesis

&gt; Yes, but with more knowledge than before so as to make an informed decision. If failure happens repeatedly, then a country should change its constitution to rectify it.

So if the republic fails just replace it with another republic? Yet when the king’s dad does something people don’t like we need to tear down the whole system? And how many constitutions do you need before it is a failure 

&gt; In most democracies, yes, you can. America is an outlier here, being constitutionally locked into an election every four years with no ability to change it.

No that isn’t true. In fact it is monarchies that do with with prime ministers. And btw no country is a real democracy at best your country is a democratic republic 

&gt; Proof?

Just look into any of his recent affairs and actions 

&gt; Because in one of those two systems the people are allowed to choose who ""the guy"" is. 

From the same batch of cronies that we are forced to choose every year. Like why can’t you just vote for whoever or why have campaign ads that cost millions? 

Has Ireland had more bad Prime Ministers than good? If so how many more before you decide the republic has failed? Because I can assure you the us has had more bad than good presidents 

&gt;Are you actually describing ending Franco's fascist dictatorship as ""cowing to the mob""?

No what I am saying is Juan Carlos giving up the chance to be an absolute monarch in favor of democracy. But I guess he is Satan incarnate because he killed an elephant 

Oh and when his popularity fell he abdicated for his son who is still popular with the people. Better than any of your presidents will ever do

&gt; No. Not even close.

Yes very much so 

&gt; America didn't take part in the Irish War of Independence, what are you talking about? Woodrow Wilson actively opposed Irish independence when it was pitched to him at the Treaty of Versailles.

Wilson was one of the worst presidents in US history. Plenty of Americana politicians actively funded the rebellion and the Irish rebellion fashioned themselves after the us revolution 

&gt; Ask a Swede or Norwegian why their country is successful. I guarantee you that not a single one will say the monarchy.

And is Ireland successful because of its presidency?

&gt;As for Britain and Spain, both are having serious trouble and have much richer republican neighbors in Ireland, France, and Italy.

What? Britain is the 7th biggest economy in the world. And Spain has a smaller population than either of those countries 

&gt; bruh you might wanna get studying because if you're majoring in medieval history I think you're about to fail you course.

What period of medieval history are you talking about? Every country went through civil wars including republics. I don’t see how it is relevant. Are republics bad because Rome went through civil wars when it was a republic? 

&gt; The Hundred Years War wasn't the only civil war France had. For most of the French Kingdom's history is was constantly balancing on war.

What country wasn’t back then?

&gt; It means that the Kingdom of France wasn't really the Kingdom of France, it was the Kingdom of Paris and a couple other patches of French land that the king controls.

That is literally the 500s you are talking about. After Pippin the Short and Charlemagne France became more centralized 

&gt;If the majority of France isn't controlled by the king, can you really say that the kingdom was successful?

Depends on what point in the 1200 year history of France you’re talking about. The French Republics spent half their time being occupied by foreign forces 

&gt;Yes it does. There is a reason why historically most monarchies literally changed the name of the country whenever a new dynasty popped up. Look at China, Egypt, Turkey, Korea, ect.

That isn’t monarchies. And no it isn’t changing the system. The Qing system remained mostly the same as the Ming system for example 

&gt;They didn't rip up the constitution because they didn't have a constitution.

Sure they did it was called the Bible but France destroyed their multiple constitutions 

&gt; No, because whereas monarchies define themselves by a family, republics define themselves by a constitution. Regardless, one family taking power via a violent rebellion =/= a politician taking power by winning a democratic election.

You realize elective monarchies are a thing right? No monarchies are not entirely defined by family. How funny you overlooked me mentioning 9 dynasties in 1000 years is certainly better than 5 republics in 200 years 

&gt; The fact that he was democratically elected.

So if a chimp was elected that would be better than a king

&gt; That is a myth. There is no concrete proof that monarchies bring in significant amounts of tourism revenue. The main country that makes that argument is Britain, despite Buckingham Palace only being the 6th most visited tourist attraction in the UK, and no other monarchical site being relevant. Even with this, the Palace of Versaille, Palace of St. Petersburg, and Topaki Palace all still bring in significant amounts of tourism revenue, despite the French, Russian, and Turkish monarchies being dead.

That isn’t a myth. The royal family donate their private earnings not just tourism. 

https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4950897/queen-money-economy-monarchy-2017/

So again how much money did the president of Ireland bring your country?

&gt; Yes and, as said above, I detest fascism and disagree with it, even when it's been democratically elected.

So you’re fine with democracy only when it answers to your standards? Doesn’t sound very democratic to me. And you say america is not a democracy when we allow all political parties to exist 

&gt; Abortion isn't slaughtering children, it's a surgery to remove a clump of cells that haven't developed a consciousness or brain.

So you admit it is living since cells are living. Great be consistent when can we kill any living thing whenever we want to? On top of that can you kill someone who is in a coma?

And btw biological science disagree with the “clump of cells” argument. Technically we are all clumps of cells. So stop denying science

&gt; In a Parliamentary system, yes, it very much is. The current Irish government for instance is the result of negotiation and compromise between three different parties in order to form a government.

Forming a union with similar minded parties isn’t compromise. Regardless UK has the same system and have done it better than Ireland for the past century 

&gt; But you understand why their not being bloodshed makes it better, right?

Oh don’t worry there’s still bloodshed. It’s just instead of deciding which better warrior can lead the country it’s whatever elitist the system spits out and give us a binary option. Again I prefer a system that isn’t the same as a high school prom (funnily enough democracy is more in common with choosing a prom king and queen)

&gt; As opposed to a monarchy, where nobody gets a vote and he can come to power even if not a single person likes him?

Why is voting an innately important thing? You don’t even think people should decide their leader unless it fits within what you find as an acceptable political ideology. So don’t give me a lecture on how important it is to let the people decide what they want.

Also even now the king of Spain is more popular than virtually every republic leader 

Regardless this isn’t even relevant to the current discussion. How does Spain having a king instead of a president change anything? The king has no power and is a figurehead. So tell me why should Spain replace its old white silver spoon billionaire with another old white silver spoon billionaire?

Is there anything that could happen to Ireland for you to lose faith in republicanism ?",,/r/europe/comments/i3p6tw/spain_amid_scandal_support_for_the_monarchy_sinks/g0em9so/,MiddleSignature1,1596596359

There is a significant Arab population in Romania and our intelligence agency (SRI) is actually good amd lowkey. They do their work in silence. 

The reason I say this is because my cousin who is from Syria recently applied for Romanian citizenship and I don't think I've seen this kind of vetting process in Canada (where I live). He had to get interviewed a few times from SRI and they had a full on dossier on him containing all his information, making sure he had no links to anything, etc.

Oh well, Farage and his groupies are fortunately gone now from EU parliament and reasonable people can continue their work.

It is the political legacy that survives him.  Over the course of decades, Hume argued that for nationalists—those who want Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom, to be merged with the Republic of Ireland, a separate country—what mattered was the unity of people, not the unity of territory (though this remained his long-term aspiration). To him, violence was wrong in all circumstances. And to unionists—his opponents, who favored Northern Ireland remaining a part of the U.K.—he argued that no stability could be achieved without the inclusion of nationalists like him. On both arguments, he won. For his efforts, he shared a Nobel Peace Prize, and the violence that plagued Northern Ireland for decades is largely a memory. "")  

It must have been painful for him to see Boris Johnson trampling over the Good Friday Agreement during the Brexit saga and to see his life's work needlessly put on jeopardy for political posturing.",,/r/europe/comments/i3nx76/a_1998_speech_at_the_eu_parliament_of_john_hume/g0ep9vc/,InnocentiusLacrimosa,1596598216

There are two different issues that get conflated and politicized:

1. The question of 2% spending, which has nothing to do with Trump but has been a constant request for the past 20 years due to the fact that the US military is increasingly overextended since it also has to maintain the security balance in Asia.
2. Trump's personality and populism, which are indeed deplorable.

This is the distinction that the article in the OP was trying to make, but as usual it is drowned in the noise of ideological battles and of partisanship pro or against Trump.

Yeah the fact about GNU was just to emphasize how Linux is a cooperative effort,  your point about GNU is true but you could also say the same thing about Linux(kernel), in the end, it is ""just"" a kernel you can't make an OS with just a kernel and the point you talked about with Linux could also be used with GNU an operating system could be made with GNU programs(you would only need a separate kernel like BSD or Solaris), I legit can't imagine Linux without tools like bash(A GNU shell) and as you mentioned systemd. The thing is that when a person talks about Linux they aren't talking about Android(where a lot of people are unaware that it runs on a heavily modified Linux kernel) or the kernel as an individual thing they are most of the times talking about distributions like Ubuntu, Manjaro, Debian, etc. which runs on a Linux kernel with GNU utilities and programs. Cloud systems also run on these distributions which would not function the same without GNU programs and utilities like GRUB(a bootloader without which most Linux Distros could not function), GNU C compiler and Bash.

537,"&gt;so it literally doesn't matter if someone is raised to rule and is the most qualified person to lead all that matters is people like a guy enough?

Yes.

&gt;Even then there have already been referendums in Spain to retain the monarchy.

In a democratic system the people have the right to change their minds. That's why leaders have to run for reelection instead of just getting power for life and being elected once.

&gt;Of course anti monarchist want a new referendum now so they can ride off recency bias.

Yes, and that recency bias came from the royals getting caught taking bribes from the fascist theocracy that is Saudi Arabia. (An absolute monarchy, by the way, which should give you example why being ""raised to rule"" doesn't actually make you a good ruler.)

&gt;And yet whenever a president is caught up in a scandal we NEVER hear about a potential referendum to remove them.

Yes we do, they're called ""elections"". However, monarchs can't be voted out in an election, so you need a referendum to get rid of them instead.

&gt;Like in South Korea did people start a referendum to restore the Joseon ruler and become a monarchy when they found out their president was breaking the law?

No, they just threw their president in prison and elected a new, better president who wasn't corrupt.

&gt;No republics DO have nepotism it is inevitable

Of course it's inevitable, but republics aren't a system built entirely on nepotism. Monarchism is built specifically to support nepotism.

&gt;And no it doesn't derive from the lowest level

If the people don't obey the government, the government ceases to be a government. That is why, at the absolute lowest level, the consent of the governed defines a rule.

&gt;it derives from typically two platforms both heavily funded by corporations. The doesn't even go into the details of the details of the systems where people often get no say at all with appointing a person. Like take my country where in 1973 the US Supreme court

Ah, you're American. That explains it.

&gt;Why don't you explain how the incredibly enlightened 21st century has made a system that has worked for millenniums obsolete?

By finding that democratic countries have a much better standard of life than that millennium-spanning system ever had.

&gt;why did the kingdom of france last over 1000 years yet in under 200 years France is on its fifth republic?

And here we have someone who clearly has not studied medieval French history.

France as a monarchy was a country constantly ruined by civil war. At one point half the country was ruled by the King of England, who was also a Duke of France, because monarchism. For about 500 years or so of French feudalism, the King of France actually lacked power in much of his country, and the most powerful of the French lords were effectively independent countries that only really payed lip service to the idea of being subjects of the king.

As well as that, it should be noted that France went through nine different dynasties in its time as a monarchy. Your claim that

&gt;France is on its fifth republic

must be accompanied with the fact that France had nine dynasties, some of them falling and then reestablishing themselves. In the same way that France had five republics, it also had twelve kingdoms. (Thirteen if you count the Lancaster claim, and fifteen if you also count the Bonaparte claim.)

&gt;Regardless what do you think of countries like Germany where the president is purely ceremonial and yet gets paid thousands of euros to do nothing?

I'm from Ireland, which does the same. I disagree and think we should abolish the presidency (even if I do love the current Irish president, I think the office is somewhat redundant) and simply not have a head of state. Either way, spending thousands on a president is better than spending millions on a monarch, like countries such as Britain and the Netherlands do.

&gt;Also you are literally saying the minority doesn't matter.

No I'm not. Every action is either supported by the majority, or opposed by the majority. In that way, every single political action is either tyranny of the majority or tyranny of the minority. I believe majority is better, for obvious reasons, but I support protecting the rights of everyone, and of trying to find a solution that pleases everyone, though obviously this isn't always possible.

&gt;do you like your current president?

As I've said I do like Higgins, the current Irish president, but he doesn't do much.

no it wasn't. The 100 year happened over birthright disputes. Yes I know the early kings had very little power but what does that have to do with anything?

&gt;As well as that, it should be noted that France went through nine different dynasties in its time as a monarchy. Your claim that

changing dynasties doesn't mean changing the system. Just because the crown goes from one branch of the family to another doesn't mean they ripped up the constitution and made an entirely new system. By your logic republics go through new dynasties all the time. Like Louis XVI was a Capetian the same people who ruled since 987. Even then 9 dynasties in over 1000 years is a hell of a lot better than 5 republics in 200 years

why? what makes your beloved president so much better than a 1000 year old tradition? Does your president bring in millions like every monarchy? and clearly you aren't educated enough in politics to understand why parliamentary systems separate head of state and head of governments

&gt;No I'm not. Every action is either supported by the majority, or opposed by the majority. In that way, every single political action is either tyranny of the majority or tyranny of the minority. I believe majority is better, for obvious reasons, but I support protecting the rights of everyone, and of trying to find a solution that pleases everyone, though obviously this isn't always possible.

and at one point the majority of germans thought killing jews was OK.

588,"&gt;What we see from the actual statistics is that men are just about as likely as women to have experienced domestic violence. 

The only time you get gender equal experiences of domestic violence is when you look at domestic *abuse* or make no difference between the level of seriousness (e.g being raped and slapped by your partner are both counted as the same type of offense). In this sense, domestic violence is and has always been more of a women's issue than men. 

That being said, just because it's more serious for one gender doesn't mean it should be ignored for the other, and I do agree that there is an issue where female on male violence are not taken as seriously and that should be addressed. 

&gt;The age-old and thoroughly debunked argument that ""it's worse for women"" is baseless, as the article also covers practices that most certainly aren't.

Usually it's because getting rid of them was never a priority, in most cases at least (Spain is a different situation).


e.g. in the UK, we haven't had a civil war since the 1600s (although, the one we had was pretty exciting, we even had proto-anarchists and proto-socialists) and the monarchy hasn't done anything to generate enough outrage to make them truly unpopular.  

I'm not a monarchist, but I also don't think that spending political capital on abolishing the monarchy is a top priority right now.

There is no argument. You assumed there were no foreign troops on US soil, were shown to be wrong, then tried to move the goalposts by saying active duty soldiers. 

&gt;there are no regular, active-duty German soldiers

That is false. The Patriot detachments in the US are active duty German forces. All of their ADA are active units. In NATO just because you're assigned to a non-deployable training billet doesn't make you not AD unless you're assigned at reserves base in a reserve unit. 

I like how you started having to resort to moving the goalposts to try to make your points, but still fail at it. But I'll humor you.

I have heard more good than bad about turkish turks, but can't validate this, as I've never met one.

I may feel bad for the few who are trying to assimilate and try to fit in, but those are rare, too few people to count.

Lmao yeah sure keep making shit up. Armenia is even less relevant in Turkey than Somalia.

&gt;threatens war with Greece

Greece threatened military action to enforce their unreasonable EEZ lmao you are so ignorant i don't know how you feel ashamed typing these.

&gt;threatens war with Cyprus

You are just listing whatever few things you know about Turkey at this point I am only responding because I am hoping this might be an educational experience for you. Strong-arm diplomacy is certainly isn't ethical but its not threatening war its just not giving a shit about what a weaker nation demands from you.

&gt;threatens Europe with refugees

Refugees want to go to Europe the only thing stopping them is Turkey you should be thankful that Turkey even considered keeping them here for some euros when no amout is worth the trouble and it was probably the number one must unpopular decision Erdogan did. Turkey has literally no reason to hold foreigners who just wanna use us for transit. You all fucking are okay to break every human right there is to send them back to war-torn fucked up nations but god forbid Turkey ever think of letting refugees go through as they wish.

I really wonder what will you numskulls would have done if Turkey seriously was like Russia and just wished your destruction.

&gt; threatens Israel

LOL Turkey and Israel are literally best pals they have disagreements time to time and put a show for internal propaganda but the geopolitics demand these two nations being friends more proof of your ignorance. Keep going.

&gt;claims Syrian territory

Turkey has never claimed any Syrian territory there is no attempt to Annex any lands. Occupied territories has hardly any Turks claiming them would be extremely unpopular move where millions of Syrians would get citizenship in Turkey that nobody wants and locals don't want Turkish dominion either. Turkey only there to prevent a PKK state.

&gt;send arms, mercenaries to Libya’s...

You have to gall to mention this when France is backing a genocidal warlord in Libya lol. Yes that's a whataboutism and doesn't really excuse Turkey's actions but unfortunately im not that informed in Libya situation so I won't comment on it much unlike you I don't talk about things I don't know. I have no idea why we are in Libya.

&gt;Who wouldn’t hate what Turkey is doing?

If your hate comes before understanding its not hate its brainwashing Have you ever asked why? Why Turkey doing these? Is Turkey simply some fantasy style evil nation? Or is there are reason for these actions? are you sure you are getting all the details from carefully tailored western articles?

I don't even support more than half of these things but if your understanding of the situation is Turkey is an evil, genocidal and racist nation that's out to conquer and dominate their neighbors then you are a fool.

&gt;I just hope you realize one day your Turkish media has shoved your collective heads into the sand and wake up before you find yourselves in a war with a country that can hold its own.

785,"Wow you stop looking 2h and it's back at being a neonazi dumpster fire in eastern europe.

PIS are a gang of neonazis/nazi sympathizers/theocratic white supremacists and going increasingly masks off about it. There were reports that they begun trying to use plain clothed officers to secret-arrest (kidnap?) people accused of being ""leftists"" in the last week.

The fact they don't bother hiding they consider half of society subhumans (and don't even start me on minorities) and become louder about their support for domestic violence and misogyny suggests to me that we were mistaken when we asked the soviets to go soft on the so called ""democratic activists"" for those that'd later become PIS.

Because obviously they're not democracy/progress supporters. They claimed to support ""Solidarność"" but all i see now is a bunch of barbaric neonazis shouting mysoginistic, biggoted, racist garbage plotting the persecution of women and lgbts; and i would see even my own base rights less threatened in eastern Europe if the PIS trash were in fact in prison. 

And the more they keep implying about ""inferior women needing to learn their place"", the more they keep falsely defaming minorities while PIS is ordering the polish police &amp; justice to cover up the polish catholic church's pedophiles' (while maintaining a dubious PIS/polish catholic church political relation); the more i think the soviets were too soft on the Kaczyńskis and should just have tossed them in a cell. https://www.dw.com/en/how-the-catholic-church-ties-in-to-polands-judicial-reform/a-39809383

And it certainly wouldn't be in europe's favor to have a mix of nazi germany's ""aryan polish zone"" and a 1980 saudi arabian theocracy in all but name right in the middle of europe led by PIS barbarians.

869,"Fair enough. But Sweden did have no large issues with Northern Germany during their time as an Empire historically, and other multicultural Empires that I mentioned were much further, culturally &amp; linguistically than Germany and Sweden. Norway (historically) was only a personal union - not full on annexation. It's another matter of control entirely. I do also believe that Swedes would still be the one major culture in such an Empire (especially if you count Finns as ""Swedish"" during this period, which IIRC was the case historically). Other places such as Estonia and possibly Latvia remember Sweden as ""the good days"", and so rebelling at least for a while seems unlikely (though I do realize that being nice doesn't work in subjugating people).

You're right about the Finnish rebellions. They were never ""Us Finns want independence from you Swedes!"" but more like ""hey taxes are annoying"" sort of deal. Just regular stuff. As for uprising, well. It's difficult to say. It didn't happen historically over the course of 700 years -so it does seem unlikely. But nationalism did replace religion as the leading force in the Europe during the 18th-19th century or so, so who knows? Furthermore, Swedish (the language) was more popular in Finland during this time, so perhaps only the Eastern parts of Finland would've even thought of rebelling? It's really impossible to say - the Finnish national identity is such a recent thing and, seemingly, wasn't even thought of as a thing before 1809 (or so).

You're probably right about the Orwellian oil. I don't know, and educating myself on the matter is something for another time, but that was more to show how resource rich such a nation would be. The stonks from Norway should not be underestimated, however. 

Also, as you said, the **union** of Norway was lost to nationalism. And to add to that, not only nationalism in Norway, but lack of much in Sweden. What I mean is, not only do we not know how a fully annexed Norway would behave inside Sweden (would they be as rebellious? impossible to say), but even then, historically speaking, Sweden was sort of done with wars and conquest by the 1870s or so, and so when the time came to drop Norway a couple of decades later, it was done without larger issue. Yes, I know there were some events surrounding it, but it was far from any civil war.

Truly, for such a state to prosper, is a tad unlikely but not as unlikely as let's say.. the Prussians being the dominant power in Germany. Or the Ottomans gaining power out off all the Beyliks. Or the Muscovites gaining ground in Russia. Or Rome being the one city out of many in Italy to thrive. Sweden was on it's way to becoming a really major world player by the year 1700 - definitely relative to its population and size. It would most likely require some Swedish equivalent of Peter I or an Augustus to fully work, but even with some above average ruler, I see it as not too far fetched.

957,"Our previous prime minister stepped down in February and a new government was set up by the president and the parliament without any elections. The new right-wing ruling party (especially the prime minister Janez Janša) is very polarising - it either has a sizeable cult following or is hated. Ever since they came to power in March, there have been weekly protests in Ljubljana, demanding the government to step down.

Since March there have been many allegations of corruption, allegedly exploiting the corona crisis for their personal financial gain. The prime minister is a good friend of the  equally scandalous Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban, who even previously sponsored their political campaign. He is very Trump-esque on Twitter, demeaning virtually all media and harshly criticising Slovenia's socialist past (although it was the left-wing partisans who liberated the country during WW2 - a sentiment which is still very much alive). What he has been saying recently was very much in line with the Polish and Hungarian governments, instead of aligning with the rest of the EU and the more progressive nations. His latest hobby is trying to pass a law which would dramatically cut funding for the national TV and radio, while also trying to make them more obedient and supportive of his party. In fact, they (SDS party) even unofficially run their own TV station (Nova24). It is basically our version of Fox news, spreading a very biased, far-right, nationalist and conservative sentiment. He pretty much refuses to appear on other stations, accusing all other journalists of spreading fake news and collaborating with the deep state.

Almost immediately after taking office he/they(SDS) appointed their own people to the heads of police, army, the national institute for public health, the statistical office, the Slovene Intelligence and Security agency and many other national institutions. They also increased their own salaries to the maximum still legal amount (while the country was going through a crisis, but not increasing the salaries of health workers). Other parties in coalition have also had their share of scandals, with both the minister for economic development and the minister of agriculture being accused of corruption, and two more ministers stepping down due to being in similar circumstances. The government is also under scrutiny regarding how they handled the corona crisis and how they have limited the rights of NGOs when it comes to environmental protection.

Not really. We *are* accepting insane amounts. More than 1 in 4 of all Swedes have a foreign background, the majority from Syria. The third biggest city has an almost 60% foreign population, almost the entire increase in population in 2019 came from immigration, and the immigration that year was smaller than it had been for a looong time. We actually just admitted we have no idea of how many people live in Sweden because of the large amount of illegal immigrants.

While the marshall plan was nice, it was not much. 1.4billion $ over 5 years. But it wasn't raw money, it came in the form of mostly food, medicine and petroleum. The main benefit and cause for Germanies rapid reindustrialisation was its reacceptance by the other European countries.

Can't find a source on the 50% GDP loss but I find that hard to believe considering the immense destruction due to the occupation and civil war, shouldn't it be much higher? Like 80% of industry, 90% of infrastructure were destroyed and 7-11% of population died, that's gotta have more dire effects than 50%",Deutschland,/r/europe/comments/i2uy6z/poll_who_would_eu_countries_be_willing_to_help_in/g0chvf4/,chairswinger,1596560843

1059,"&gt; Would that be the 2 countries that America invaded containing neither Bin Laden nor the promised WMDs?

No one claimed Afghanistan nor Syria has WMDs. But interesting to bring that up because Assad did gas his civilians during the uprising and chemical warfare is considered WMD. 

&gt; 9/11 was very sad and all, but there is no way to claim that the US government did not leverage it to justify ethically dubious military interventions. Here we are, over 18 years later and it's still being trotted out like some sort of prize pony. 15 of the 19 perpetrators were Saudi nationals, and not a peep from the US there. Given the evidence available, it seems likely that certain Saudi officials contributed financially to the attack ( Fahad al-Thumairy, Omar Ahmed Al-Bayoumi, Mussaed Ahmed al-Jarrah), though it's impossible to be sure.

Weird flex, the person I commented to was saying isis and osama bin laden were the same. They were not. 

&gt; Pretty sure Osama turned out to be a Saudi national who was found in Pakistan, yet the US continues to have diplomatic relationships with both those countries.

Osama did not turn out to be a Saudi National he was stateless (the pilots were), he was being hidden by the Taliban as the head of al quada. And yes he was found in Pakistan which has its own dark connotations towards Pakistan. Also the reason the US did not ask Pakistan to operate and kill him in Pakistan. And also why Pakistani relations are strained to this day. 

&gt; It's somewhat amusing from my perspective that an Americans response to 2 very dubious wars is ""we should have done more war"".

You find it dubious that thousands of people were killed and beheaded. That they destroyed countless artifacts. Or perhaps you only care about the fact that there was more refugees. All of that could have been prevented by US engagement. But the US didn’t want to do it. Probably because of all the backlash from the last war. 

&gt; I don't particularly mind if you think the US has in no way whatsoever contributed to the rise of terror organisations in the ME. I just disagree.

The US obviously plays a part. But acting like terrorism wasn’t there before is childish. It’s why the US went to Afghanistan. Iraq was to throw off Sadam and stabilize oil.",,/r/europe/comments/i3gf7p/nearly_half_of_germans_support_withdrawal_of_us/g0byvq0/,randocadet,1596552954

And people of different races tend to have different cultural backgrounds.

Interracial couples, at least as a byproduct of globalisation, are fairly recent. I would expect the majority of Europeans under 40 to be largely okay with it, but most of the ones over 40 (which is most of the people who were not raised in a multiracial, globalised era) would understandably be less open about it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_espionage#Germany

&gt;Germany

&gt;German counter-intelligence experts have maintained the German economy is losing around €53 billion or the equivalent of 30,000 jobs to economic espionage yearly.[74]

&gt;In Operation Eikonal German BND agents received ""selector lists"" from the NSA – search terms for their dragnet surveillance. They contain IP addresses, mobile phone numbers and email accounts with the BND surveillance system containing hundreds of thousands and possibly more than a million such targets.[75] These lists have been subject of controversy as in 2008 it was revealed that they contained some terms targeting the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), the Eurocopter project[76] as well as French administration,[77][75] which were first noticed by BND employees in 2005.[76] After the revelations made by whistleblower Edward Snowden the BND decided to investigate the issue whose October 2013 conclusion was that at least 2,000 of these selectors were aimed at Western European or even German interests which has been a violation of the Memorandum of Agreement that the US and Germany signed in 2002 in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks.[75] After reports emerged in 2014 that EADS and Eurocopter had been surveillance targets the Left Party and the Greens filed an official request to obtain evidence of the violations.[75][78]

&gt;The BND's project group charged with supporting the NSA investigative committee in German parliament set up in spring 2014, reviewed the selectors and discovered 40,000 suspicious search parameters, including espionage targets in Western European governments and numerous companies. The group also confirmed suspicions that the NSA had systematically violated German interests and concluded that the Americans could have perpetrated economic espionage directly under the Germans' noses.[75][79] The investigative parliamentary committee was not granted access to the NSA's selectors list as an appeal led by opposition politicians failed at Germany's top court. Instead the ruling coalition appointed an administrative judge, Kurt Graulich [de], as a ""person of trust"" who was granted access to the list and briefed the investigative commission on its contents after analyzing the 40,000 parameters.[80][81] In his almost 300-paged report[82] Graulich concluded that European government agencies were targeted massively and that Americans hence broke contractual agreements. He also found that German targets which received special protection from surveillance of domestic intelligence agencies by Germany's Basic Law (Grundgesetz) − including numerous enterprises based in Germany – were featured in the NSA's wishlist in a surprising plenitude.[83]",Europe,/r/europe/comments/i3ek5z/us_cloud_supremacy_has_europe_worried_about_data/g0bc1pa/,Romek_himself,1596538628

In 12 days of testimony, Babić described his conversations and meetings with Slobodan Milošević and a number of his co-perpetrators and their role in the commission of crimes in Croatia in 1991. Babić provided crucial insight into Slobodan Milošević’s state of mind and the control he exercised over institutions and structures he used to carry out his plan to rid large areas of Croatia of non-Serbs. Babić’s testimony showed that Slobodan Milošević played a central role in the crimes that were committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.

Babić testified that Milošević controlled all of Serbia’s institutions and a number of its highest-level leaders, as well as Bosnian Serb and Croatian Serb leaders. He stated that Milošević was at the top of the Yugoslav military chain of command and appointed its leading officers, as well as those of the Bosnian Serb and Croatian Serb armies.

Legally, Babić explained, the JNA Commander-in-Chief was the SFRY Presidency. However, Babić found out that Milošević effectively took over the JNA’s Supreme Command in July 1991, by controlling half its members (called the Rump Presidency), as well as the SFRY’s Defence Minister Veljko Kadijević and the JNA’s Chief of the General Staff Blagoje Adžić. Milošević, Babić said, was the one deploying the JNA all around Croatia from October 1991.""

Drowning persons are in panic, they cling to anything. These DLRG people are trained to break this, and even for them it's dangerous. If they can, they rather use a ship and a paddle, or throw a ring near them. Then it's non-dangerous if the person is clinging to that.

So, if you are going to try to secure one out of water, then just get a log, or pole, or a branch from a bush or tree first. Don't let the person cling to you, endangering yourself in the process.

Another reason is that people in life distress in the water are often there for a reason. E.g. muscle cramps due to suddenly very cold water. Or strong currents.

1300,"As soon as the Ottoman people left the teritory of the Principality of Serbia (an agreement that was written in 1830. in the second of the three edicts (hatisherifs) that the sultan gave out to Serbia), their land was sold and redistributed to the Serbian pesantry - this was a symbolic ""breakup"" with the feudal ""timar"" system of land ownership.

But, the complete removal of feudalism happened in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (back when it was named the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes) when agrarian reforms were the top priority and part of the normative text of the 1921. Vidovdan constitution.

So basically, feudalism was removed, but the very last of the wealthy landlords and aristocrats will cease to exist in the period of agrarian reforms (from 1921 to about 1931 if my memory serves me).",,/r/europe/comments/i354f1/1835_serbian_constitution_sretenjski_ustav_every/g0b48ys/,BogaMafija,1596530880
1301,"I think you're somewhat in the right direction, because we both have similar goals of a cohesive society, I just disagree with so much of it. 

For one thing, ""they separate themselves"" is so counterintuitive, because immigration and housing policy of most European countries often forces people into what are effectively ghettos where they all congregate. Of course ""integration"" will be less in such an instance, why wouldn't it be? The same would be true if 50,000 white Dutch people were crammed into one neighbourhood in Mumbai... Would they become Indian? A lot less than if they were more dispersed. 

""Are hostile to Dutch people,"" see as a white immigrant myself...  the people who've been nicest to me in my life here have been other immigrants from all backgrounds. In my experience, it is white Dutch people that have been most hostile to me. This is a really complex issue. Ultimately, one is the minority group and one is the majority group with power... I tend to side with the minority group that has less power in that case. 

""but it is their job to integrate to be Dutch,"" this is also such a hard thing to define. Must they wake up and eat stamppot and hagelslag to be Dutch? Or must they vote the same way as people that live in Spijkenisse? I dunno, this is such a hard thing to define. I'm not even saying you're wrong here, just that this is a really tough thing. If the parameters are undefined, then people can hide their racism behind ""oh they're not integrating"" with no true goal of ever actually being satisfied. 

&gt;They separate themselves by not integrating.

As I have written already in this thread

1. Gelou *might* have been Vlach, the others were ""Kozar"" and ""Cuman"" respectively.

2. There is no historical evidence that Anonymus didn't just made up those names.

&gt; There even is a Hungarian source if I’m not wrong that states there were vlachs living there.

More precisely Anonymus is our *only* source about this. He mentions that blacus or blasij lived in a Carpathian basin along with Kozars and other people we know from no other sources. Which is rather suspect. When it comes to the conquest of the Carpathian Basin Anonymus was not writing history, but historical fiction.

So no, he is no evidence that Vlachs would have been living here.

 &gt; There is also the stories that state how the other two Romanian states formed (Moldova and Vallachia), in which there is mentioned that people from across the Carpathians came over and created the two countries, in what we call the tradition of ‘descălecat’

The is about the situation in 1987, specifically American nuclear weapons deployed in West Germany. A country that no longer exists.

&gt; Yet, when Trump announced withdrawal of 9,000 troops from Germany, Germans have heavily criticized the move. 

We're in 2020, this is about Germany, not West Germany, and 9,000 troops are not nukes. They're different things, nukes drink less beer for example. I'm sure you can grasp what sets them apart.

&gt; I am not sure what Germany wants US to do to make Germany happy. What can American Presidents do to serve Germany better?

From anectodatal experience. I don't think anyone has done a study to find out whether that is hunderd percent the case,

Instead I will show you a few reasons why the phrase All Lives Matter is criticized and considered by some racist.

The phrase is often said as a response to “Black Lives Matter”."" It reflects a view of ""racial dismissal, ignoring, and denial"".

Philosopher Chris Lebron describes ""All Lives Matter"" as a ""disingenuous retort"" that misunderstands the problem raised by Black Lives Matter proponents.

On Real Time with Bill Maher, Bill Maher expressed support for use of the ""Black Lives Matter"" phrase, stating that ""'All Lives Matter' implies that all lives are equally at risk, and they're not"".

1740,"&gt; Firstly TikTok is a subsidiary of Chinese company ByteDance, which is an issue to begin with considering China has been at the forfront of intellectual property theft since the beginning, no one even comes close.

Not sure why IP is relevant here but kind of amusing to say that since Facebook has tried to copy TikTok with Lasso and is failing miserably.

&gt; Secondly evey single Chinese company with over 50 employees, is beholden to the Chinese goverment. Rules aren't exactly a thing there, they don't need a warrent to see data, they just do it. ""Theoretically"" they own every company in China.

You explained why this is wrong yourself in the previous sentence. China can do that to ByteDance, it cannot do that to TikTok. You further explain why this statement is wrong in the next paragraph.

&gt; TikTok specifically is a problem due to how massivily popular it is and the type of content that's posted there. TikTok is flooded with Chinese propaganda as well as massive amounts of political debate.

Never have I heard anything like it being flooded with propaganda, looking at the top 100 creators and don't see anything even remotely related.

&gt; TikTok doesn't care about international politics as long as the narrative of China good continues. They remove anything that's critical of China, there was a very popular video of a teen girl doing a makeup tutorial while speaking about Uighur activism, it was removed.

This is a typical case of only reporting what we want to be relevant, TikTok's policy document showed indications to restrict any content that may be about still sensitive themes, including the example of **Northern Ireland**. (https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tiktok-censored-talk-of-northern-ireland-independence-8kch23jtx)

1760,"Upvote for quality post! I haven't re-read my original post buy I'll do my best to answer. (I finished this 3 in the morning because who needs sleep anyway?)

First of all I think I mentioned the population issue as a future not present problem, I'm not discounting the greatness of the swedish military and military infrastructure. However it's my understanding the second army Charles raised wasn't of the same quality as the veteran army that met it's end at poltava. You absolutely corrected me on the overall point though (Sweden not being able to handle a poltava level loss).

As you pointed out the diplomatic situation was very difficult. It didn't help that Sweden had few natural allies besides the Ottomans, and the commonwealth probably wasn't super keen on allying with a kingdom that had burnt down half the country only about 50 years earlier, though stranger bedfellows have been found.

My mention about subsides from france  (I believe?) was mostly a reference to how Sweden became a great power in the first place. I guess that wasn't made clear.

I do have to disagree with the notion that controlling the baltic would've been enough to keep great power status in the 19th century with introduction of a more global imperialism and more trade routes. It absolutely would be a powerful regional power as baltic trade was still profitable, but I do not believe it would truly be a great power without significant overseas assets.

It is incredibly hard (as an amateur) to guesstimate the Swedish population in the 19th century if the empire still existed, I guess the question is if the living conditions of the average swedish subject would've increased/stayed the same, and if it increased would it increase enough for america not to be tempting? I do not have the knowledge to answer that question but I would guess that the conditions for the average swede wouldn't have increased greatly enough to make a big difference unless the crown made an effort to improve the conditions for the lower classes.

I would argue Prussia had the greater potential for empire in the long run simply by being german as it allowed them to exploit german nationalism in the 19th century and thus be able to create a greater german identity. They reached their full potential when they founded the German empire. Creating a scandinavian empire and identity would've required GB and the Netherlands to allow Sweden complete control of the sound, it would be possible with a strong ally but incredibly hard. 

Lastly Tver suddenly coming back as an independent principality seems a little EU4ish, I don't think 19th century Tverish nationalism was a thing? Or 18th century for that matter. We obvioisly don't know but it seems a bit ""out there""?
 Sweden meanwhile would possibly have to deal with a new finnish national identity emerging among finnish speakers which would've been a tricky situation. That's a huge chunk of the population.

In the end it seems to me so many things would've needed to go right for Sweden to still be a major power, which was the original topic if I remember correctly. So might technically be possible but incredibly unlikely, some areas of the world aren't as good of a startpoint for empire as others.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/hgsqoo/the_caroleans_carrying_charles_xiis_body_back_to/g0a1j9l/,Moxboiio,1596503217
1761,"&gt;Why should we help these corrupt countries with low taxes where the money will just dissapear into the pockets of corrupt politicians?"".

Clearly talking about Ireland! As an Irish person, can I just say... when we brought in that famous low tax of 12.5%, everyone thought we were brilliant in the EU and outside , our economy grew, then we started getting rich, oh dear.. then it started around 2000 that suddenly nobody should have low tax according to the EU. By the time we were no longer taking from the EU but being a net contributor, it seems like the EU didn’t like us anymore. 

When the German banks collapsed in Ireland in 2008, guess who had to pay the bill. We’ll be paying that bill for another 50 years. We know in Ireland we got screwed by the EU in that bailout.

1823,"&gt;That is not the majority of the outstanding 300 billion Euro debt and the French and German Government could have easily bailed out their banks.

Thanks for setting this straight. Point still stands, a default would've dragged the entire eurozone down, and at that point, neither the eurozone nor the IMF likely could've saved Europe from a hard crash. 

&gt;How about we ask them to give up their fiscal sovereignty?

That is the point. Neither France nor Germany wanted this, so the Euro was pretty much doomed to produce the very situation in which the group would have to take mutual responsibility for individual members' debt accumulated through trade and productivity imbalances.

---

Edit: these imbalances are also the reason why Germany's trade balance is so bizarrely positive. We benefit from the net average exchange rate. Germany has great productivity at fairly low wage levels in a currency undervalued for its economic situation. We also gain access to cheaper labour on the European market. While the press regularly hails this as an achievement, it's actually not desirable to have such a skewed trade balance. It hints at low domestic demand and low wages.

Whereas Greece and Italy have to deal with the opposite, an overvalued currency and lower productivity / more expensive labour, comparatively.",,/r/europe/comments/i2uy6z/poll_who_would_eu_countries_be_willing_to_help_in/g09mu8r/,htt_novaq,1596495337

The scapegoat will always be the thing that is most far away from you culturally that you can find. In Italy the fault is of the Southerners (but I'm sure they say the same about us) in Europe the fault is of Germany and the rest of the ""North"". 

In terms of the mishandling of funds and corruption, the North of Italy has historically being characterised by an incredibly toxic political culture. There was a time in which a serious pro eu party could win in the South while the North has always voted first for Berlusconi and then the Lega. If we wanted to be taken more seriously in Europe and for our government not to mishandle our money we shouldn't have than that, the South and especially the Centre are way less guilty for the current state of Italian politics.","Veneto, Italy",/r/europe/comments/i2uy6z/poll_who_would_eu_countries_be_willing_to_help_in/g098gb9/,Giallo555,1596488244

That's the reason Tsipras came to power, because the people saw that even with all these austerity measures the economy wasn't getting better, as it was supposed to. We didn't just wake up one morning, found out that we had run out of money and then demanded even more so we  could continue party forever. We tried to help the situation as much as we could but the measures were ridiculous. 

The whole thing with the referendum is quite complicated and I don't believe comparing countries to individuals or national debts to buying a house are good analogies, but I get were you are coming from.

The fact that other people have also been in a similar situation doesn't justify it, it makes it worse.

2033,"No it's not a stupid question at all. It is true that after Franco died, Juan Carlos led the transition to democracy. There were two main schools of thought after Franco's death: those that completely opposed the Franco regime and wanted to start anew, with completely different institutions, laws, etc., and those who wanted to work with ""the system"" and turn the dictatorship into a democracy from within. This debate is known in Spain as ""[Reforma o ruptura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reforma_o_ruptura)""

What you say is mostly true, and we are taught in schools that our Transición was ""exemplary"". There are many pieces of evidence that suggest otherwise, but this is kind of a touchy and complicated subject so I won't get too much into it.

For example, Juan Carlos is usually regarded as some kind of saviour and national hero after successfully stopping the 1981 coup d'état. Some say, however, [that this coup was fake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_Spanish_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt#Alternative_theories) and staged by Juan Carlos itself to boost his popularity among the Spanish people.    

Some people also don't consider the Transición to be a real rupture with Francoism, since in 1969, [Juan Carlos was declared by Franco to be his successor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Succession_to_the_Headship_of_the_State) after death.

Please consider once again that this is a very nuanced matter which can't be answered in one simple comment, but in a nutshell, yes. Juan Carlos I is publicly regarded as one of those responsible for turning Spain into a democracy. However, many discordant voices have appeared ever since who question his role during that period of time.

So maybe it's better for bureaucrats to not interfere too much in this regard too?

&gt; competition with other nurses, because who gives a shit

competition helps to choose better service if it's preferred or cheaper service if this one is preferred. Well governed hospitals beat badly governed ones. In public sector, is easier for badly governed hospital to stay, in worst case taxpayers will pay more.

Maybe social benefit of publicly runned hospitals can be replaced by healthcare vouchers, which seems to be easier task, less regulated and less costly than running public hospital (as you generally don't feel as enterpreneur when you are managing public hospital and don't have urge to be as best as you can when there is no competition).

How is it a threat? Litterally the only reason Its still from UK is because we have reached an era when you don't need to have a port nearby to know If there are enemy ships. We have reached an era when a single radar can do that work, or a satelite. 

&gt;And a reminder of a empire reduced to a holidays resort.

Except when you know how that conquer happened.
English troops lost a battle on the west, then tried to get alies on the east front and failed. And before going back to home they just put a flag in the name of Charles of Austria on the south. Then they changed that flag for the english flag and called it a day. 
Years after that they asked Spain to increase the size of the frontier because they were afraid of the cannons constantly pointing at them. The piece of land was so short that they couldnt even cover themselfs from a cannon ball. 
And on theese days UK is throwing sand at the sea to make it bigger...

No I don't, that's why I said ""You can't really compare those two."" but if I was to argument about former kingdoms meaning anything then those cities would still be Spanish as Spain is way more of a successor to the original settlers of those cities than Morocco. But again, subjective and pointless argument. Also Whataboutthism is a fallacy. 

&gt;It's not an 'illicit activities hub'. More drugs pass through Algericas each year than Gibraltar. 

Just because Algeciras is more illicit(citation needed) doesn't make Gibraltar any less illicit. This also is Whataboutthism.

&gt;Even if it is a tax haven, it's irrelevant where it is. Do you really think if Gibraltar was Spanish the people using it for tax purposes will just say ""oh no game's up time to start paying Spanish tax"", or do they just move to the next tax haven?

Yeah the ""on our shores"" part was more related to the ""illicit activities hub"" than the tax haven. Mainly contraband and smuggling.

They can't do that anymore. 

Germany has benefited the most from the euro since the mark would have been 20% more expensive than the euro and they rely so much on their exportations. 

European budget is peanuts anyway. 

I'm not saying that Germany isn't a great asset for the euro zone by the way. Just saying that they benefited from the euro (which is great) and the vision that they would be better off is wrong. And by Germany I mean the German industry and economy. I'm not saying that the average German worker benefited from it...

There were two Turkish invasions 

The first one was on the behest of Makarios afaik as well, and Turkey has every right to intervene. It did well to invade once. Peace talks followed afterwards. The first invasion was accepted by the international community.

During peace talks, and a ceasefire, Turkey invaded a second time, this time pushing deep inland and occupying a big chunk of the island. Turkey then refused to give the occupied land back, instead proclaiming the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus as a new state, and nobody agreed with Turkey. 

Turkey proceeded to invite settlers from the mainland on the occupied part of Cyprus as an effort to change the demographics of the island as a whole. 

Turkey has also been found guilty numerous times on the European Court of Human Rights for a number of violations. 

Turkey is the only country in the world that recognizes the TRNC, and still has a huge for (around 50.000) troops occupying the island. Greece has around ~2000 troops on the other hand. 

What lies are people fed where they live to believe that people are mad Turkey invaded to stop an ethnic cleansing? People are mad Turkey stayed, and occupied the island.

2345,"&gt;Serfdom was abolished/fell out of favor in Western Europe (especially in places like France and England) already in 14./15. century.

You jump to Western Europe because it's convenient. But it's irrelevant. I said ""the rest"" of Europe, I'll give you that - but if we're talking gypsies and slavery, France and England (or Western Europe) are not terribly relevant, are they? And as an irony, in Eastern Europe, **that's** pretty much when it became prevalent. And even more of an irony, in much of Western Europe (except for Britain), it was officially abolished **after** Wallachia and Moldavia. Great cherrypicking there.

&gt;but not the people 

Please spend 30 sec reading about what serfdom means. Yes, you could trade people, the only difference is that you'd also have to trade the land. But selling and buying serfs was a thing. But that's not the issue here. The peasant Romanians for most of the time would be just as miserable as the slave gypsies. Just because some lordling at some point mistreated this or that gypsy (and has the legal right to do so) doesn't say shit about how much worse the situation of 99% of the gypsies was compared to 99% of the Romanians.

2418,"&gt;  Abandoning the traditional family model has crashed the birthrates.

Birth rates are dropping in every single country of the world, regrdless of what they think about the traditional family model. If anything societies that seemed to care more about the tradicional family model in the developed world are the ones falling faster: Japan, most of eastern europe and south europe in the recent past.

Reason being, your idea of the tradicional family model only existed for a brief history of every country. With the exception of the last century and an half, families with many children that grew up to be adults was nothing but an ilusion. Families had a bunch of children, only to see most of them die during childhood, this is what tradition was for millenia. With modern medicine, children were less likely do die during childhood, so people started to adapt to it and have less children.

2457,"Serfdom was abolished/fell out of favor in Western Europe (especially in places like France and England) already in 14./15. century.

Serfdom was a horrible instance of exploitation by which those that owned the land (and not the people) certainly did profit immensely.

Still, as bad as serfdom was, slavery was in most instances worse. And the worst was chattel slavery. Where the person was a slave from the moment he was born until the day he died. And if he had any children, they were also born into slavery. You could beat them and rape them and treat them how ever you wished as long as you didn't kill them. And if you didn't like them for what ever reason you could just sell them as if they were chattel. That was the type of slavery under which the Roma lived in Romania/Moldavia. Basically like African in Americas. I'm guessing you'll explain now how some of them worked as cooks and weren't treated so badly?

In any case, as bad as serfdom was, and it was bad, the serfs had a number of protections that a slave could only dream of. You could never mistreat them as you could a (chattel) slave.",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/i2t97k/roma_holocaust_memorial_day_romani_holocaust/g0728a7/,Novalis0,1596452121

2572,"&gt; 15-10 years ago the topic of LGBT rights here was non-existent.

This isnt exactly correct, LGBT movement had multiple stages, each building up on the last, path LGBT acceptence taken to reach this point is much longer then you think thats why post-communist countries taken longer to accept LGBT because it didnt start in those countries then.

here is a bit of timeline of LGBT acceptence:

Homophile movement (1945–1969)
Immediately following World War II, a number of homosexual rights groups came into being or were revived across the Western world, in Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the Scandinavian countries and the United States. These groups usually preferred the term homophile to homosexual, emphasizing love over sex. The homophile movement began in the late 1940s with groups in the Netherlands and Denmark, and continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s with groups in Sweden, Norway, the United States, France, Britain and elsewhere. ONE, Inc., the first public homosexual organization in the U.S, was bankrolled by the wealthy transsexual man Reed Erickson. A U.S. transgender rights journal, Transvestia: The Journal of the American Society for Equality in Dress, also published two issues in 1952.

Gay Liberation movement (1969–1974)
The American Psychiatric Association removed ""homosexuality"" from the diagnostics manual of mental illness in 1973.

The new social movements of the sixties, such as the Black Power and anti-Vietnam war movements in the US, the May 1968 insurrection in France, and Women's Liberation throughout the Western world, inspired many LGBT activists to become more radical, and the Gay Liberation movement emerged towards the end of the decade. This new radicalism is often attributed to the Stonewall riots of 1969, when a group of gay men, transgender women, lesbians, and drag queens at a bar in New York resisted a police raid.

LGBT rights movement (1972–present)
From the anarchist Gay Liberation movement of the early 1970s arose a more reformist and single-issue Gay Rights movement, which portrayed gays and lesbians as a minority group and used the language of civil rights—in many respects continuing the work of the homophile period. In Berlin, for example, the radical Homosexual Action West Berlin  was eclipsed by the General Homosexual Working Group. 

Gay and lesbian rights advocates argued that one's sexual orientation does not reflect on one's gender; that is, ""you can be a man and desire a man... without any implications for your gender identity as a man,"" and the same is true if you are a woman. Gays and lesbians were presented as identical to heterosexuals in all ways but private sexual practices, and butch ""bar dykes"" and flamboyant ""street queens"" were seen as negative stereotypes of lesbians and gays. Veteran activists such as Sylvia Rivera and Beth Elliot were sidelined or expelled because they were transgender.

2603,"You still refuse to admit that anyone can have concerns about the way and kind of immigration that has occurred the last decades without being a fascist or racist. Just because the far right exaggerates and obsesses over certain problems for political gains and uses them as an excuse to promote morally wrong things and paints with a broad brush, does not mean that they don't exist. The left is simply willfully blind to these issues and it is completely unacceptable. I will quote here a relevant point made by a certain person:
&gt;Just because the consequences of your actions are things that your ideology does not support, it doesn't mean that your actions do not indirectly support those things. If you have the choice to change, but do not, you are culpable.

The (far) left is culpable for the consequences, including violent hate crimes/terrorism, of ignoring rampant antisemitism and homophobia among certain demographics and even worsening the problem by continuing supporting the expansion of these demographics and giving them a free pass. I have read about Belgian and French Jews voting for the far right Vlaams Belang (Flemish Interest) and Front National out of desperation because they don't ignore the intolerance and other problems associated with certain demographics. Why should the safety and well-being of Jewish and gay/lesbian communities (that have already been through a lot; not to speak of everyone else) that have lived in Western Europe for hundreds of years be sacrificed for intolerant newcomers because not letting them in is ""racist"" and ""fascist""? This is complete idiocy and simply morally wrong.

&gt;you are a racist in self-denial

Being intolerant of intolerant cultural attributes *is not racism*. You continue to maintain and refuse to admit that there is an obvious double standard and it is, again, the result of the (far) left only being capable of looking at the world through a binary ""oppressor-oppressed"" lens and therefore seeing ""brown"" people as innocent victims instead of people with agency and potential oppressors themselves (like ""white"" people).

To give yet another example, you generalized the (presumably virtually all ""white"") people in the area where you live as ""racist"" and yet it is ""racist"" to say that Lebanese are severely homophobic, when opinion polls say that 85% of them (and by the way, if it helps ease your mind, Lebanese are not only Muslim but also Orthodox Christian and Druze) don't think homosexuality should be accepted by society.",USA (from the Netherlands),/r/europe/comments/i068kp/on_this_day_29_july_1962_fascist_oswald_mosley/g06npj1/,moon89286,1596437336

Being poor limits their ability to afford media so they limit themselves to state owned TV as it’s free unlike private news channels. Again it’s mostly elderly so they can’t take information from the internet.

Guess what Hong Kong people want to be China and same goes for Taiwan, their Dream is to reunify with China but America is just standing in the way so they don't lose power, its pathetisch. America and their evil cronies like Japan want to keep power in Asia so they try to slander China.

2668,"Oh, it took me a while to understand what NS1 and NS2 meant.

Schröder did not build NS1. Companies build it. Really, it's not a state-owned pipeline. Sure, the state has a role here, e.g. in negotiating. Or into environment checking. But this is in Germany not at the federal level. Chancellors don't build such things. That doesn't mean they cannot force or hinder it, e.g. they can connect the right people.

Actually I don't know exactly why Germany and Russia want that pipeline that badly. I think the idea started when two decades ago Russia and the Ukraine had a big dispute about what Russia pays for the Gas and Oil they use domestically. I think at that time Ukraine threated to close the pipeline for good if Russia wasn't accepting their price --- or the other way, Russia threaten to stop the flow if Ukraine won't pay the price. It's so long, I forgot the details. But I definitely know the turmoil and the threats hanging in the air.

So a pipeline that doesn't cross these eternally struggling relatives makes sense, if you ask me. In any case, any pipeline makes sense. If a ship goes wreck, then usually MUCH MUCH MUCH environment will be spoiled compared to a pipeline breaking down.

I [read](https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Artikel/Energie/mineraloel-oelimporte-und-rohoelproduktion-in-deutschland.html) that Germany imports 40% of it's oil from Russia --- which saddens me, because it means that indirectly Germany is financing russian Oligarchs and their engagement in East-Ukraine, Crimea and Syria.

However, for the sole reason that the USA is now trying to bully Germany into behaving like they want, I'm now for this pipeline. This is simply not their business, especially when their motive is to just sell them their fracking oil and LPG gas instead.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/i28zuf/germany_wants_europe_strong_again/g06ozrq/,holgerschurig,1596438569

Many gay guys in Romania tell it to some girls but never their guy friends, they told me I was the first straight guy they told (especially among the Romanian community) and whilst one was openly gay, the other was acting really interested in girls with other Romanian guys around (which was why I as his best friend in uni and apartment  roommate in the last year was really surprised when he told me). At graduation his father came and because he told him about the other guy (the open one) his father said loudly ""so this is the guy that takes its up the bottom?"".

2853,"Yes, it is true. And worst thing is people don’t know what it’s for. I mean they along with Catholic Church had anti-LGBT agenda for years but are taking things to the next level. Their supporters usually come from small villages and aren’t well educated so it’s easy to make them think that LGBT people are bad because they most likely never met anyone like that (or don’t know if they did). However, PiS is now saying that the treaty on domestic violence is just western “genderism” and I’m pretty sure now they’re doing it because church told them to. As you said Poland is ultra catholic so these people from villages will vote for whoever priest tells them to vote for. Church tells them to vote for PiS and gets money and power in exchange.

2856,"The church hasn't been wielding very much influence here since the 1990s/1980s really. Liberalisation of contraceptives and the legalisation of divorce, homosexuality, abortion, same-sex marriage, etc. and the publicisation of Church scandals have all happened from the '90s onwards.

Although the last census (2016) put the percentage of Catholics in the country at just under 78.3%, for many it's just a box ticking exercise. Also between 2011 and 2016 (the censuses) there was an increase of people stating they had no religion by \~74%

Like many Catholics don't actually go to mass. I think weekly mass attendance is around 30% in Ireland, relatively high compared to other European countries but it's a collapse in attendance from \~30 years ago.

And there's been other surveys about religious beliefs and there's been a not insignificant number of supposed Catholics who disagree with fundamental Church doctrine like transubstantiation and all that. And then of course there's stuff like abortion and same-sex marriage which passed by referenda.

Going on my own personal experience there's definitely been a rejection of the Church in favour of being indifferent, irreligious, atheist or some kind of personal spirituality or Christianity less attached to the church as an institution. People are angry and disgusted with the abuses, corruption, interference and decadent excess of the Church over the decades.

There's still issues with the Church and its control over schools (\~90% of primary schools are under the patronage of the Church) and hospitals though, as a legacy of the early days of the state where certain public services were offloaded to the Church which continued up until relatively recently.

As you've said, the church has definitely wilted. I went on a bit long but hopefully it was interesting and informative :)

3221,"Boris Johnson has speeded up plans to curb the judiciary after axing a manifesto pledge to hold a commission on changing the way the courts operate. The Prime Minister is expected to announce next week that he has set up a panel to examine the issue of judicial reviews, which were successfully used to overturn his decision to prorogue Parliament last year.

Mr Johnson believes the courts have become increasingly politicised and are being used to “conduct politics by another means” and wants to define in law what they can and cannot be used to challenge.

The Conservative Party's last manifesto promised to set up a Constitution, Democracy and Human Rights Commission by December to examine “in depth” issues ranging from judicial reviews to the Human Rights Act.

But instead, Mr Johnson has decided to speed up the process on priority issues by setting up small, highly expert panels to deal with each element individually.

Government sources said an announcement on a judicial review panel was expected next week, with the aim of producing a report on how the system can be reformed in the next three to four months.

It would mean changes to the law could be passed early next year which would prevent a repeat of Mr Johnson’s humiliating defeat in the Supreme Court last September, which found that Mr Johnson’s decision to prorogue Parliament had been unlawful and ordered him to reverse it.

The case was brought by businesswoman Gina Miller, who argued that Mr Johnson had wanted to prevent Parliament scrutinising his plans for Brexit. Two years earlier she had used a similar process to force Theresa May to consult Parliament on triggering the Article 50 process to begin the countdown to leaving the EU.

The Tory manifesto said that judicial review would remain “available to protect the rights of the individuals against an overbearing state, while ensuring that it is not abused to conduct politics by another means or create needless delays”.

Mr Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has been an outspoken critic of the judicial review process, reportedly saying there had to be “urgent action on the farce that judicial review has become”.

In his internet blog, he has said that the process of judicial review needs “major reform” and that attempts to curtail its scope will lead to a “mega clash” between Parliament and the courts because it has until now been up to the courts to decide what is and is not justiciable, in other words capable of being challenged in law.

He said judicial reviews, which date back to the 16th century, were a “great blessing” when they were introduced, but he now believes the courts have overstepped the mark.

The panel examining the judicial review process will be asked to determine whether Parliament should define in law what is and is not justiciable.

The Government will then respond to its findings before tabling legislation to enact reforms.

Other expert panels will be set up later in the year or next year to examine other legal issues including updating the Human Rights Act, the functioning of the royal prerogative, and the ability of the security services to defend the country against terrorism and organised crime.",,/r/europe/comments/i2he10/boris_johnson_ready_to_curb_the_scope_and_power/g04otn7/,casualphilosopher1,1596394333

And I am not just comparing the UK to the Netherlands because I'm aware there are differences. I'm also comparing it to other Western European countries. I'd much rather drive in Spain or France than the UK. I'm not saying NL road system doesn't have its fault either, I can make a whole list for you if you want.

Always when I post some criticism of UK culture, infrastructure or built environment, straight to the point directed directly at the issue, I get a bunch of defensive reactions. But rather than acknowledging any of my points, people tend to get all worked up about things *they're implying I said but never actually said*. Or how dare I have such clear-cut straight-to-the-point opinion without saying sorry and please 3 times before, during and after. That response combined with the persistent 'there's nothing wrong with UK roads, there can't be!' attitude is where my British exceptionalism comment came from.

Nobody here is saying the UK needs to repave every stretch of road 3 times a year, but why can't I say that your just renewed roads are of shitty quality? If they weren't, I wouldn't have to say it. And you seem to also be assuming what I want for the UK is larger roads? If anything it's the opposite, as you could have read between the lines when I talked about city road networks. The amount of lanes and widths of UK city roads .. speaking of overengineering.    

You have way too many towns still that have entire streetscapes being swallowed by depressing black tarmac. Massive amounts of traffic choking the high streets with nothing but noise, fast-moving metal and exhaust fumes, rather than on an ""overgineered"" bypass. And then you're wondering why the high street is dying and why there's barely any life in the town anymore. And the hilly argument is as old as time and I assume will never die.

3460,"&gt;We do not disagree nearly as much as you think. 

I am looking for common ground.

&gt;Politicians pleasing their voter base is one thing, clientelism a whole other and is/was a well established feature in the south including Italy, knowingly pushing long term harmful policy for short term gain on a significantly larger scale (and Spain in the past but a lot less now, they are ok in the macro and will be fine).

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Most policies have winners and losers even if it's a netto benefit to society, and that is not different in the north or the south. Perhaps it takes different forms, but the privatization irregularities in the north aren't clean either. No, I have to dismiss this notion as harmful stereotyping that stands in the way of a solution.

Greece didn't increase their debt-to-GDP ratio in the decades leading up to the crisis of the late 00s. The qualification of ""solvent"" doesn't apply to repartition systems either, so I don't see what you're talking about.

&gt;to micro level policy creating and maintaining protected business classes (stupid example only specific stores can sell specific products for no particular reason).

Those are concrete policies where improvement is possible, and I actually think they're better suited to create a change in the way business is done in Italy than ideologically disputed macro level interventions without concrete effect on the street.

&gt;That is frankly not their jobs nor their responsibility, the goals of higher growth and fiscal sustainability are set.

Those goals are adhered to. If they want to put conditionality in the treaty then it can't be a blank cheque, that is normal. Unless they're also giving a blank cheque to deal with the consequences if their recommended/imposed policies go awry, like in Greece. If they want complete control of the economy they need to accept complete liability for the outcome (i.e. guarantee social security). That's the right proportionality and we can put the slider anywhere between the two extremes, but they can't impose a grand economical policy for a generation in exchange for a one-time alm.

&gt;He proposed private pension systems based on capital gains.

Frankly, what would that solve? To begin with, it would exacerbate the balance of payment problem for the current pensions and the fiscal pressure, as employees would have to pay for the repartition pensions *and* for the capitalization of their own pensions. Even waving that away, it'll take half a century to implement fully. And even insofar it *is* implemented, it's vulnerable to stock fluctuations, and if the stock markets collapse, on whose door will the poor impoverished pensioners come knocking? Right: the Italian government's. It doesn't reduce risk for the state, it's a temporary fix to make the number look better on paper. 

It's just the privatization fetish of the neoliberal/austerity train of thought playing up again.

&gt;Better to take away resources from unproductive older people (who do not buy cars and fridges) cop the drop consumer spending (doubt it, old people don't consume as much) and instead of repaying debt spend it on capital and education in an attempt to increase the capital share within the economy and increase labor productivity.

Mobilizing existing capital is something that will have to happen, and there are many methods for it. But an unprecedented move like cutting existing pensions will brutally undermine the trust in the Italian state and that's *not* something the country can afford. That's the state coming back on an essential security promise to its people, that's much worse than a state defaulting on its debt.

So to grease the gears of economic activity we shouldn't fight ideological battles in the ivory tower but instead ask Giovanni in the bar next to church who wanted to start a company last year why he didn't.

3513,"Sight. It's frustrating that the author in question name drops Michael Kofman (one of the rare Western analysts who actually tries to understand how the Russian military intends to fight, rather than projecting their own assumptions into it), and **still** frames the problem as an A2/AD one, regardless of the fact that the concept is almost nonexistent in Russian military thinking. 

It conflates a bunch of different capabilities that could be considered ""long sticks"", such as S-whatever, Iskander, Kalibr, cyber (???) and frames them as a part of some A2/AD problem that NATO needs to solve for, rather than in the terms of Russian military thinking on their usage, complete with meaningless circles on a map.

And then we have the hybrid scare, whatever the word means nowadays. Hybrid A2/AD, ugh. Just read this absurdity:

&gt;Port and supply chains are also vulnerable to Crimea-esque “little green men” operations and

So Russian naval infantry and special forces physically seizing a port is ""hybrid warfare"", and not what marines are actually supposed to do. So if Russian naval infantry take off their unit patches they become some hybrid soldiers who need to be dealt with in a completely different way?

And this is also a part of the A2/AD problem set, because of course taking a port is denying the enemy the use of a port. 

Maybe the whole of Russian ground forces are an area denial force, because they are supposed to take ground, which denies it to the enemy. Sweet Jesus. 

&gt;As hybrid activities tend to fall below the threshold of war, they also challenge NATO’s solidarity and commitment to Article V, which states that an attack on one member constitutes an attack on all.  

Dude is talking about an amphibious landing being below the threshold of war.

Covid-19 news: [Antwerp Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp_Province) went into lockdown.

* Currently the amount of Covid-19 cases is rising rapidly in Belgium, and half of those occur in [Antwerp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp) and surrounding municipalities. That's why governor [Cathy Berx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Berx) (CD&amp;V) decided to implement strict measures in the province to stop the spread of the virus.
* There's currently a curfew in place, prohibiting people from going outside between 23:30 and 6:00 except for important reasons. People are also mandated to wear a mouthmask on all public places.
* In other places the rules also got stricter, although not as much as in Antwerp. Social contacts are now limited to five people per household and those five should remain the same for four weeks (so now three weeks to go).
* Due to a problem at the railways some trains to coastal city [ostend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostend) had delays, right in the early evening when many coastal tourists wanted to return home inland. The tourists [packed together](https://twitter.com/quinten_poppe/status/1289264395575422977) right infront of Ostend station, making social distancing impossible. When the trains finally arrived, many people broke through the barriers and started running around in chaos, [videos can be found here](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/08/01/oostende-station-te-veel-mensen/).

Political news: The leaders of [N-VA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Flemish_Alliance) and [PS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parti_Socialiste_\(Belgium\)), [Bart De Wever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_De_Wever) and [Paul Magnette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Magnette), are still leading the government formation. 

* Currently they're making good progress with the Flemish social democrats [sp.a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialistische_Partij_Anders) and the Christian democratic parties [CD&amp;V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christen-Democratisch_en_Vlaams) and [cdH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_d%C3%A9mocrate_humaniste). Those five parties have 70 of 150 seats and thus need one more party for a majority. But that's where the liberals are now making things complicated.
* The five parties want the Flemish liberals [Open Vld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Vlaamse_Liberalen_en_Democraten) to join without their French speaking sisterparty [MR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouvement_R%C3%A9formateur), mostly because the other negotiators don't trust the MR's leader [	Georges-Louis Bouchez](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges-Louis_Bouchez).

3603,"I wouldn't make too big a deal out of this.

The technical difference, in this context, between a *migrant* and a *expatriate* is that a migrant is a person who moves from one country to another, as in being in the process of doing so. This is a temporary act, as you effectively stop being migrant once you settle somewhere. Immigrating is the process of moving into a country, emmigrating is moving out.

A person who is an *expatriate* is someone who (may have been forced) to leave their home country with either no intention or option of returning to the home country. Expatriates are often people who have fled, live in exile or are refugees whom are barred from returning to the home country, or people who gave up their claim to their nationality.

Now, as you see, we've fucked up the difference a long time ago, as the person to whom you responded readily seems to think that *expat* is not a synonym of *refugee*, which it actually can be. Furthermore, in common language the word is often used for people who live and work in a different country than their home country with the intention of permanent residence.

""On 1 March 2017, Korwin-Mikke sparked controversy by stating that women were paid less than their male counterparts on average due to them being ""smaller, weaker and less intelligent"", during a debate in the EP regarding the gender pay gap.[21][22] Two days later, Korwin-Mikke would make further comments stating that there was a stereotype that ""women have the same intellectual potential as men” and it “must be destroyed because it is not true.”[23] Later he was suspended for 10 days from the plenary sessions of the EP.[24]""

The smaller and weaker argument is because there are pay gaps between men.

3648,"&gt;and not crusade since Bush didn't call for a religious crusade similar to that of Erdogan  

Yes, he did. He literally refer to the war in Iraq as a crusade and the christian world vs terrorism bullshit was heavily implied all throughout.

&gt;Bush and Obama called Islam the religion peace and the US actively works with many Muslim leaders. Stop with the ""West hates Muslims"" narative. It is used in totalitarian anti-Western countries in order to steer up hate for the West. 

I'm not citing a narrative, I'm citing facts. I never said that the West ""hates muslims"". People in the West see them as some type of ""other"", not as people - and the ""West"" has been actively destroying their countries one by one in for profit wars, precisely because of that fact. I am no fan of Islam and I am staunchly against islamisation, but I don't see muslims as some caricature, regardless of this or that they are human beings.

How do you think muslim people in villages of Anatolia feel when they see what's happening in Syria and Iraq? Especially after the coups and the western support for them, even though so many people in Turkey died.

It's really easy to just pile on Turkey and what they are doing wrong, but what are the steps we the supposed enlightened westerners are taking to make the situation better? Systematically destroy every muslim country around them and fill Turkey with refugees while very thinly veiling the racism we have for them. Leading them on when they tried to take steps for EU membership...

That's no different than what Turkey is doing to Greece, Turkish nationalists don't care about the concerns of the greek people - they see them as the ""other"", they don't see the two sided picture, they just see that the islands and their EEZ is giving them a lot of trouble.

Reading from his parties' ""ideological declaration"" ([here it is in full btw](https://wolnosc.pl/deklaracja-ideowa/)) 

&gt;**VII. THE ECONOMY**  
&gt;  
&gt;**We reject any government intervention in the free market**, in which decisions are made by tens of thousands of entrepreneurs and millions of consumers. **We believe that everyone is the architect of their own fate.** We reject any forced redistribution of goods. We believe that'll bring great economic growth and lasting prosperity. For this purpose it is important to **get rid of legal obstacles to economic activity**, which should be run by individuals and their companies. **We categorically reject any economic activity by the state, including healthcare and schooling**. In the future we want to **have all natural resources be privatized**. We will strive to rely on **a currency independent of the state**. We are also convinced of the necessity to establish a **legal ban on indebtedness of the state and local governments**.

&gt;a chick with a dick

A chick ain't less of a chick if she's got a dick, if she identifies as a girl and wants people to perceive her as such it's nobody's right to police what's between her legs

&gt;hermaphodite

This is an old fashioned term that fell out of usage, you may want to use words like ""intersex individual"" (a person born with such a genital configuration, or with any other medical condition that prevents from referring to them as universally male or female) or ""androgynous"" (a person who takes on an appearance that defies standard male/female aesthetic expectations)

&gt;trap

This is a term you shouldn't use at all, cause it implies that people who act and look like and identify as a girl are trying to ""trap"" you into gay sex just because they have a penis. If that person identifies as a girl, she's a girl, regardless of the set of genitalia she was born with. You may say ""trans woman"", ""transgender woman"", ""trans girl"", ""transgender girl"", or something along these lines. These people may build an artificial vagina through a surgical procedure, but since they were assigned male at birth, it's very likely that before said procedure they may have no vagina at all. Also they don't ""look like girls"", they *ARE* girls

&gt;wtf is a femboy then? Just a person who’s male by gender but associates as a girl?

If someone associated as a girl their gender would be the one of a girl, which is female. A femboy is a person who identifies as male, whose gender is male or male-aligned, and whose appearance and mannerisms strictly associate with canonically female expectations.

3897,"&gt;With 25 companies testing their vaccine candidates on humans and getting ready to immunise hundred millions of people once the products are shown to work, the question of who pays for any claims for damages in case of side effects has been a tricky point in supply negotiations.  
&gt;  
&gt;“This is a unique situation where we as a company simply cannot take the risk if in ... four years the vaccine is showing side effects,” Ruud Dobber, a member of Astra’s senior executive team, told Reuters.  
&gt;  
&gt;“In the contracts we have in place, we are asking for indemnification. For most countries it is acceptable to take that risk on their shoulders because it is in their national interest,” he said, adding that Astra and regulators were making safety and tolerability a top priority.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dobber would not name the countries.  
&gt;  
&gt;EU officials told Reuters this week product liability was among contentious points in European efforts to secure supply deals for potential COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer, Sanofi and Johnson &amp; Johnson.  
&gt;  
&gt;The United States, however, already has a law to exclude tort claims from products that help control a public-health crises in the form of the 2005 Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness, or PREP Act.  
&gt;  
&gt;AstraZeneca, Britain’s second-largest drugmaker, has pledged to supply a total of more than 2 billion doses at no profit in agreements with the United States, Britain and European countries, among other nations and organisations.  
&gt;  
&gt;Astra’s deals differ from most rivals because it has secured government backing for production and development efforts, while competitors such as GlaxoSmithKline are looking to negotiate a price for a finished product, contingent on approval.  
&gt;  
&gt;To back its claim to forgo profits from the $1.2 billion collaboration in the United States, Astra has even granted the government access to financial accounts related to the venture, according to Dobber.  
&gt;  
&gt;“There are very clear milestones before they are going to pay. Because we made the promise to manufacture the vaccine at no profit, auditors of the U.S. administration will get free access to our accounting books,” he said.",,/r/europe/comments/i28316/astrazeneca_to_be_exempt_from_coronavirus_vaccine/g02day4/,yolo4everlmi,1596352563
3898,"Yeah, so the Nazis and the Italian fascists allowed the Church to become a country, something they still benefit from today, because they were persecuted. The surviving Nazis all files to Catholic countries because the Catholics were so persecuted. They never excommunicated one Nazi because of the persecution of the Jews, but they found time to excommunicate one for marrying a Protestant. The Church literally celebrated Hitler's birthday. The line the church has told doesn't hold up to history at all. Fascism and the Catholic right wing were mostly interchange at that time. The Church still refuses to address the anti-Semitism that led to the Holocaust, either, or apologize for the deicide stuff.

Just like Easter Island (in which the Moai were moved up to 16 km (10 miles), The early Brits cut down all their trees. First to build woodhenges, then mostly to move the famous bluestones of Stonehenge ~325 km (200miles) from the quarry outcrop of Carn Goedog, on the north slope of the Preseli Hills in south-west Wales.

Rolling them on three trees per meter, 3000 per km, took them about one million trees. They also used up all the larger trees for the giant sarsen stones. The ancients then burned the few remaining trees left in a great worship of fire to their ancestors and deities. 

After that was complete the Druids all jumped an iceberg to Canada before the Romans could conquer them. The Vikings then tried to conquer them in Canada but the Druids beat them back and used their Polynesian allies to kick them out of Greenland. 

They celebrate that great victory every year in Nevada and call it 'Burning Man'. Scientists say this all checks out as there are no trees on Easter Island, no trees in Britain, no trees in Greenland and no trees in Nevada.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/i1mc5j/stonehenge_uk_aerial_view/g01ud9s/,Devil-sAdvocate,1596337707

Sorry, but I dont buy that. Thats like saying cars shouldnt have airbags, because they will make people think they dont need seat belts. How about instead we educate people, since these are very simple things (how to wash hands properly, how to wear a mask correctly, remind people to keep distance). 

Just because we have airbags/distancing, doesnt mean we shouldnt have seatbelts/masks, even though they are a bit uncomfortable.

&gt;Also the regular masks we as civilians have access too are pretty pisspoor and most studies on masks and their protection against corona are not trustworthy and thrown together hastily.

That seems like a vague claim, what are you basing that on? There are plenty of studies showing that masks, even ""pisspoor"" cloth or surgical masks help.  

It seems odd that you doubt so many studies on this topic, yet are more than willing to believe that wearing masks will have an overall negative effect, because people will ""think that due to having a mask they won't have to comply with the distancing and washing hands a lot"". Are there trustworthy studies proving that?

4305,"I gave Gobekli Tepe as an example of revisionism, rather than using the name that was given to it portasar,


When the Treaty of Lausanne was signed in 1923, the Republic of Turkey was established. In its attempts to shroud the Armenian heritage of Turkey, the authorities of the republic began a systematic campaign to alter Armenian placenames. These attempts included the name change of the geographical expression “Armenian plateau” or “Armenian highlands” to “Eastern Anatolia.” 
And Gobekli tepe is the most “recent example”.

By 1927, all street and square names in Istanbul which were not of Turkish origin were changed.

Then after the death of Kemal Atatürk, Village names with lexical components meaning red (kizil), bell (çan), church (kilise, like ghara-kilise in Armenia) were changed. To do away with ""separatist notions"", the Arabic, Persian, Armenian, Kurdish, Georgian, Tatar, Circassian, and Laz village names were also changed.

In 1952, The Special Commission for Name Change was created whose actions included; 28,000 topographic names were changed, including 12,211 village and town names and 4,000 mountain, river, and other topographic names.

According to the Turkish government in 1981:
&gt;
Approximately 12,000 village names that are non-Turkish, understood to originate from non-Turkish roots, and identified as causing confusion have been examined and replaced with Turkish names, and put into effect by the Substitution Committee for Foreign Names functioning at the Directorate General for Provincial Governments in our Ministry.

I agree they learned turkish because they had to. But school wasn’t as easy to find except until the 1900s with 800 Armenian schools and 1913 with 1190 Armenian schools.
We  have the story of “Der totigs school” in Armenian, semi-truth as the events were real but the kid isn’t which gives an idea on how brutal the Armenian schools were, they were taught they were subhuman against the Turks, and the teachers would get paid.

Non-western Armenians joke that if Turkey would have left western Armenians alone for another century they would become Turks.


I think the issue is deeper rooted than it seems, a simple recognition and revision of history is not all that would take for better relations, as there is Karabakh and Azerbaijan on the eastern side.

Armenia is fairing pretty well, the economic boost that Turkey would have given us in the past is no longer needed “for Armenia”.

I guess by stopping the lies is the first step, for eg, Turks believe that the Armenian archives are closed for some reason, they aren’t, and they weren’t at the time when turkey made the request too.

Accepting the genocide is the second, nothing would justify the fact that it happened.

And that’s it. No reparations needed, we don’t want anything back, just let us preserve it and rebuild it.",Armenia,/r/europe/comments/i1nsy9/greek_foreign_minister_yorgo_papandreu_dancing/g00s7x1/,Yapo_ressources,1596314987

4489,"In Bulgaria we even had national [antiziganist protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Bulgaria_antiziganist_protests) back in 2011.

The reason behind the protest was that a relative of a very illegally rich gypsy boss killed a 19 year old boy. A lot of people are angry because laws do not apply to gypsies, they can do whatever crimes they want and no one will hold them accountable. Moreover, a lot of them don't work so they survive on the working people (mostly Bulgarians), from whom the government takes the taxes and give them to the gypsies as socially deprived people.

There was also another outrageous example, when a couple of gypsies broke into a doctor's house in the middle of the night to steal and he in self-defense killed one of them. He was arrested immediately, which sparked again national protests to release the doctor. If it was the other way around, they would detain them for 72 hours and release them after that for lack of evidence.

In general, we are extremely segregated. Bulgarian live predominately in cities and the gypsies live either in slums outside of the cities or in villages predominately populated by only gypsies. I get to see them only on TV on the News or in the car when bypassing their slums or villages or when they come with their carts led by horses to search the trash containers for something valuable.

It is not normal to have lived in the respective country for a couple of centuries, whenever they came to Europe, I don't know, and still not be integrated to society.

The postbox issue can perfectly be used by companies to avoid taxes, it was confirmed when the UK (when it was still a member of the EU) tried to tax a company that argued that its siege was in Denmark while it was just a postbox and their operations were still in the UK. The european jurisdiction rejected the demands of the UK and said that it was perfectly possible to do so for a company. The real center of operations from that day wasn't anymore where the companies effectively had it but where they'll say it was.

In Ireland those headquarters are real, of course, since it's a tax haven no need to dodge the law. In other countries like France or Germany, the companies, while having a real headquarter in those countries that can have the capacity to take decisions (one of the former conditions to determine a headquarter), pretend that they are completely subservants of their official headquarter situated in countries like Ireland.

It's 75 times more than what the Soviet had to cross (400 m, I checked).

&gt;What if they pushed these ""few hundred meters"", the front would collapse and much more Soviet soldiers would die?

Why? The German Army Group ""Center"" was destroyed during the Operation Bagration, Germans didn't have power to break the Soviet front.

&gt;You make it sound like WWII was a fight for humanity and not a complex war that seen the rise of USA/USSR and end of old colonial empires.

No, I'm not. the decision to start an uprising was stupid. But the decision to not help the uprising was evil. Just because the Polish leadership was stupid doesn't mean that the Stalin's decision was good.

&gt;Pretty sure the whole world war was fought for the freedom of Poland and later conquered nations in Europe.

My comment was a little bit sarcastic but in 1944 in Warsaw the Soviets didn't fought for our freedom. They just idly looked as 200 000 people die and our capital is destroyed.

Wow, your right wing authoritarian views have some nuance, I'm so sorry I misrepresented you in my arguments! You've fallen for the anti-immigration fear-mongering and I haven't, that sure makes me the unreasonable party here!

It's pretty much summed up by the fact that you're pretending to give many fucks about antisemitism whilst completely dismissing the racism against people with different skin colour, because you want to think of them as an incompatible foreign invader rather than human beings.

Does the slavery of the Arabs and Barbers have an impact on contemporary culture in Western Europe? No, of course it bloody doesn't. Our slavery, meanwhile, continued to influence the racism that had a direct impact on our society in the 20th and 21st century. People of colour did not start on an even footing simply because slavery went away, and it is a lack of knowledge on this subject that makes the left demand education on such matters. **You cannot know that society is racist if you are not taught all the racist shit that happened over the 20th and 21st century.**

We do not want a hierarchy, we want people to acknowledge that one exists so that we can tear it down together.

As for your left leanings, fantastic. You'll be one of the people dithering as to whether or not you can fully get behind the far right rather than one of the people fighting it. Good to know. If you keep defending people voting for the far right simply because you don't like where the left stands on immigration, you're not being candid with me or yourself.

So yes, please kindly fuck off and have a conversation with yourself about where you actually stand. You've decided that immigration is more dangerous than far right politics, and for that you're a fucking idiot who will bring the downfall of the planet.

The finding were replicated. They make sense in the context of evolution and they have their parallels in how other social animals behave, including great apes.

While evolutionary psychology is not perfect, so far this is the only coherent explanation we have. The alternatives are usually based on conjecture and make predictions which are contrary to what we observe.

Would you agree that families in Norther/Western European countries (such as Norway, the Netherlands etc.) are on average more progressive/less attached to stereotypical gender roles than the world average (various surveys would suggest that)? Those countries are also actively fighting those gender stereotypes (through media and popular culture) and actively promote STEM-participation of women (through various campaigns, financial incentives and even discrimination of men in admission).

&gt;But again, that was all post-war plans. They weren't going to do that during war until the uprising happened.

I'm sorry mate, but you make it out as if Polish commanders incentivized the Germans to destruct Warsaw. Not only is this the classic ""blame the victim"" assersion, but you are creating an impression that the destruction would not happen otherwise (thus holding Polish commanders responsible for the destruction). It is wishful thinking and a myth that the damage would be less significant without the uprising. Wroclaw was 70% destroyed, Gdansk was 50% destroyed. We have to take into account those cities were less strategically significant than Warsaw, which opened the route to the final thrust into Germany. Recently, those who believe in the spared Warsaw myth, always like to bring up Prague as an example. Warsaw would never end up like Prague. Prague and Czechia were one of the last German pocket holdouts. Berlin was already taken on May 2 when the Prague uprising started on May 5.

EU is not one country, so there will be differences and not only in taxation. For example I work for British company branch in Poland. If I compared my earnings to the British branch, I would be at the bottom of the company, earning about as much as cleaning lady in London, but here in Poland it is more than 80% of poles. Is it unfair that I earn less than every British employee with the same skills and experience? Is it unfair that what is pennies for British is gold-mine for Poles?

Then it comes for corporations. Is it unfair that corporation registered in Ireland pays about 12% of it's revenue to Ireland, while in Germany it would have to pay 29%?

Personally I say ""no"" to all. Unless minimal and average salaries are equal in the whole EU, why should prices or taxes be? Companies are naturally greedy, that's why they will open branches and do most work where salaries are low, and then pay taxes where taxes are low.

I must say I don't know the exact composition of logistics in late Nov/Dec or if plans were already written by then, so I'll take your word on that. The point is - if the Soviets really did just stop so that they could wait out the uprising, they would have attacked a week after the uprising collapsed, not months.

&gt;My point is that AK was barely a threat before uprising, after couple days of fighting it was crushed.

That's true.

&gt;And Soviet leadership really cared about Katyń, that's why they were doing everything to cover it and were denying (Russians still do) it ever happened. They knew that it was a black in the antifascist narrative they were trying to build around themselves.

Well, if you put it that way, then yes, they cared about their outside image. Not necessarily about the morality of their actions behind the courtain, though.

&gt;Its really quite shocking how little the did to aid uprisers and civil population considering they were really trying to pretend they are supporting Polish cause (creating communist government, people's army and so on).

5106,"Remnants of the city's Soviet history hover over this modern fast-food. At one of Minsk’s ever-expanding KFC franchises, communism and capitalism collide in a confusing contrast of heroic sculptures and crispy fried chicken.

This is the most dramatic of Minsk’s KFC outlets, just one of many fast-food chains that crept into the Belarusian market as the country began to emerge from isolation in the last few years. KFC first set up business in Belarus in 2015, while the Soviet sculpture that sits above the fried chicken shop was carved in the 1960s.

The sculpture, designed in the style of Socialist Realism that was popular across the Soviet Union at the time, is named “Solidarity” and was created by the sculptor Anatol Yafimovich Arcimovich. The KFC was designed in the style of countless other KFCs that you’ll find across the world, from the United States to China, with the distinctive red colors of the Colonel’s enduring brand filling in for the red of socialism.

Perhaps this is how the Cold War was always meant to end, as the workers of the world unite to dine on bargain buckets of Kentucky Fried Chicken. The reality is less idealistic, but this Soviet-style KFC in Minsk is still definitely a measure of change in the Belarusian capital.

Minsk suffered immeasurable damage during the fierce fighting of World War II, but once the German army had been beaten back, Minsk was honored as a Hero City and was rebuilt and restyled into a Soviet model city, on the express orders of Joseph Stalin. The wide boulevards and elaborate murals and sculptures are a lasting relic of the Socialist era, while the fast-food chains and Western brands mark the turning point toward capitalism.",,/r/europe/comments/i1ml1b/kfc_outlet_in_minsk_belarus/fzyfshx/,Vucea,1596257641

5121,"Summary:

Covid-19 has revealed the critical importance of technology for economic and health resilience, making Europe’s digital transformation and sovereignty a question of existential importance.

Rising US-China tensions are an additional incentive for Europe to develop its own digital capabilities; it risks becoming a battleground in their struggle for tech and industrial supremacy.  

Democratic governments – keen to preserve an open market in digital services while protecting the interests of citizens – find the European model an increasingly attractive alternative to the US and Chinese approaches.

The EU cannot continue to rely on its regulatory power but must become a tech superpower in its own right. Referees do not win the game.

Europe missed the first wave of technology but must take advantage of the next, in which it has competitive advantages such as in edge computing.

EU member states lack a common position on tech issues or even a shared understanding of the strategic importance of digital technologies, such as on broadband rollout or application of AI.",Luxembourg,/r/europe/comments/i1mqru/europes_digital_sovereignty_from_rulemaker_to/fzygstm/,JackRogers3,1596258407

5125,"&gt; Yes pretty random, you basically took 2 random things Romania was bad at and provided them as ultimate facts 

Romania is bad at a lot of things not just those two. Literacy rate is another one. Healthcare quality is another one. Even the road quality is garbage. Even the plumbing is bad, a good portion of Romanians still shit in their back yard outhouses due to a lack of plumbing. Again, these are very important things.

&gt;And yes. when you pass another 143 countries and are in reaching distance of another 20 then you are not a sh*thole.

You are actually, if you are near the level of those 143 countries. Again, it doesn't mean much if you're slightly better than 143 shitholes. If you're closer to those 143 in quality than the other 20 (quality wise, not numerically), you're still third world. Truth of the matter is, most of the world lives in poverty and squalor.

&gt;First country in the world by home ownership.

I agree, this is good. This is a very important aspect of Romania. Unfortunately it has nothing to do with our current regime, but with the past one which made home ownership affordable. Let's hope this never changes, and it doesn't become a renting hellscape. Because new home ownership right now is definitely not affordable. Still, a win is a win. I am actually shocked whenever I see some fellow Romanians saying that renting is better.

&gt;Generally in top 10 internet speed globally, at times leading Europe. And best price/speed rate.

5127,"*[Though the sky was dense with cloud](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/110/110-h/110-h.htm), a diffused light from some fragment of a moon had hitherto helped them a little. But the moon had now sunk, the clouds seemed to settle almost on their heads, and the night grew as dark as a cave. However, they found their way along, keeping as much on the turf as possible that their tread might not resound, which it was easy to do, there being no hedge or fence of any kind. All around was open loneliness and black solitude, over which a stiff breeze blew.*

*They had proceeded thus gropingly two or three miles further when on a sudden Clare became conscious of some vast erection close in his front, rising sheer from the grass. They had almost struck themselves against it.*

*“What monstrous place is this?” said Angel.*

*“It hums,” said she. “Hearken!”*

*He listened. The wind, playing upon the edifice, produced a booming tune, like the note of some gigantic one-stringed harp. No other sound came from it, and lifting his hand and advancing a step or two, Clare felt the vertical surface of the structure. It seemed to be of solid stone, without joint or moulding. Carrying his fingers onward he found that what he had come in contact with was a colossal rectangular pillar; by stretching out his left hand he could feel a similar one adjoining. At an indefinite height overhead something made the black sky blacker, which had the semblance of a vast architrave uniting the pillars horizontally. They carefully entered beneath and between; the surfaces echoed their soft rustle; but they seemed to be still out of doors. The place was roofless. Tess drew her breath fearfully, and Angel, perplexed, said—“What can it be?”*

*Feeling sideways they encountered another tower-like pillar, square and uncompromising as the first; beyond it another and another. The place was all doors and pillars, some connected above by continuous architraves.*

*“A very Temple of the Winds,” he said.*

*The next pillar was isolated; others composed a trilithon; others were prostrate, their flanks forming a causeway wide enough for a carriage; and it was soon obvious that they made up a forest of monoliths grouped upon the grassy expanse of the plain. The couple advanced further into this pavilion of the night till they stood in its midst.*

*“It is Stonehenge!” said Clare.*

*“The heathen temple, you mean?”*

*“Yes. Older than the centuries; older than the d’Urbervilles! Well, what shall we do, darling? We may find shelter further on.”*",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/i1mc5j/stonehenge_uk_aerial_view/fzyh1cu/,nrith,1596258591

She chose a flamenco(kind of)-latino mix sound to make a distinctive career from it, but she could have chosen anything else as she happens to be *catalana de la ceba* without any connection to that culture, so she wasn't doing any of this before music school. You should hear what many *flamencos* think of that... She's not *La Niña de los Peines*, ok?

Historically the most popular Andalusian genre in the rest of Spain has been *la copla*, by far, but I'm not expecting that tourists know that.

Yeah, there's been a lot of flamenco in Madrid because it's wild and people wanted to have fun in the capital where the Court was before the invention of clubbing (the *juerga*, folks). Do *Madrileños* consider flamenco their own Madrileño stuff? I don't think so. The thing is that in Spain nobility had this penchant for popular culture, so they pretended to be Majos and hired gypsy performers. That's the *casticismo* for you (Did I say that Spain is complicated?)

Maybe another time we can talk about how come Catalans have really been into this Cuban genre called *Habaneras*. Are they Cubans? well they're not, but for instance their independentist flag comes precisely from the Cuban one for pretty much the same reasons. It's fascinating stuff really, way more interesting than presuming all Spaniards have to dig flamenco because that's what you've been told they do (not by Hemingway, he hated the *flamenco for tourists* BTW).

And this will of course --- hopefully --- be like that. Germany tried a little to much to boss around other countries. And it ended as a desaster for both those countries and Germany. Since many, many years, the USA is now the country that bosses other countries around and creates the desaster. Germany doesn't want this role. So us being more reluctant dropping bombs or troops onto countries is a good thing.

This is also a reason why our military spending will never (hopefully) match that of the USA.

And yes, since the iron courtain went away, Germany had the impression, that is has less foes. So it went down with it's military, IMHO too much.

5219,"While this definitely is an example of a poor PR move by Nicholas II at the start of his reign, (I’m so sorry if it’s a dick move and it’s just because it was my dissertation, apologies!), but I have to make the case that the revolutionary movements of Russia had been in full swing for more than 40 years prior to Nicholas II’s coronation; assassinations such as that of Alexander II, student rioting throughout the 90s etc. The socialists in their various guises would’ve topped whoever went onto the throne, however they did at holding onto it, before too long.

Again I don’t want to come across as a correcting knobhead, just developing a fascinating topic! Bolshevism could’ve happened back in the 1870s/80s if Russia had had any semblance of an urban industrial population, and therefore a working-class labour movement. As it was, they had only a peasantry who the educated radicals failed tremendously in radicalising largely due to their devotion to the tsar as a god-like figure.

The 1910s saw the perfect set of circumstances for the final nail in the coffin, as it were, for the tsar.

5221,"I've got no problem with the death penalty.  

But I saw people on this sub on here saying that they wanted to leave her in Syria and hoped that she'd just wind up dead one way or the other and that the evidence bar was too high and the penalties too low in the UK.  And, I'm sorry, but that is indefensible in my book.

If a country is going to sentence someone to death, have a law on the books, a judicial process for it, and meet the damn bar for evidence.  If penalties are truly too soft or the evidence bar is truly too high, then that is a problem with the judicial system, and that should be fixed.  If you want the ability to have Britons killed for actions like these, then you should have to sell the country on the punishment and the judicial process entailed.  You should *not* simply give the executive an *ad hoc* ability to order Britons killed because you consider the justice system ineffective.

The reason countries have judicial systems is as the way to resolve disputes.  If you don't believe that your judicial system can do that, then you have a problem with the dispute resolution process in your country, and that should be fixed.  The judicial power should not be effectively transferred to the executive.

A lot of the protections in the US system were built specifically to avoid [Star Chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Chamber) bullshit, since once you start giving the executive power to act judicially, you are just asking for problems.  Even if you are okay with this particular use — which I would not be — you have no ability to foresee what future administrations will do.

I think that the reason that a lot of Britons are okay with this is that they perceive a process that can only affect dual citizens (or people who the UK decides to consider dual citizens, regardless of whether the other country involved considers them so) as leaving *them* still protected, only affecting maybe first, second, third gen immigrants, who are typically who such citizenship policies as Bangladesh's apply to.  But even if they accept a system with different protections for different Britons — which I think is a dangerous road to walk — they have no power to prevent another country from extending citizenship.  A Briton born in Northern Ireland is affected by this.  Austria was talking about extending citizenship *en masse* to residents of South Tyrol. Many countries have extended broad rights to apply for citizenship, like Israel.  Countries are under no obligation to permit people to freely renounce citizenship, and some do not — Turkey, for example, requires one to do military service or pay the state compensation for not doing it before permitting renunciation.  Begum was a minor at the time of her actions and at least in the US, and I suspect most countries, had no way to renounce any other citizenship anyway until she reached the age of majority.  If your basic legal protections are subject to the whims of Kim Jong Un on citizenship policy, then I'd say that you've a fragile foundation.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/i1a5vb/shamima_begums_return_to_britain_put_on_hold_as/fzy5xv6/,duisThias,1596250944

5365,"Frankly you have lots to learn about the subjects that you imagine yourself to be knowledgeable about. Alas, your glibness exceeds your competence. You seem to have no actual understanding of how NATO and the EU function and why they exist.

To mention only your most egregious blind spot: The United States has a stable and long term geostrategic interest to prevent any alliance between Germany and Russia, which is why the CEE region plays a fundamental role in US planning. The US also has an existential interest to prevent the rise of any peer competitor, which is why the same region is crucial for its strategy.

This is why CEE is not merely a ""buffer region"" for the US and the very reason why NATO expanded eastwards -- ignoring the noisy protestations of Russia, *which were motivated precisely by Russia's plans to relegate that region to buffer zone status*. It is also the reason why the US supports and will continue to support the Three Seas Initiative, which is the modernized version of Pilsudsky's Intermarium:

[http://three-seas.eu/about/](http://three-seas.eu/about/)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three\_Seas\_Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Seas_Initiative)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermarium)

I repeat that your insistence to describe NATO members as ""buffer states"" directly contradicts NATO doctrine as well as mainstream geostrategic use of that term. Geopolitics is not immutable, so your purely geographical description is nonsensical and reveals total misunderstanding of the subject. For example, there is a non-trivial chance that the Russian Federation may dismember, in which case one of the power poles in the region would disappear. In that case, your  supposed buffer states would have nothing to buffer against.

NATO is much more serious business that some random poli-sci figures imagine. It  is about the sharpest form of hard power, namely military power. Your softie description of NATO shows that you understand next to nothing about military strategy and its imperatives. You would be well advised to leave that subject to people who do.

5377,"&gt;their troop allocation moving away from Europe to Central Asia and Far East

Not really. The article says that they're shoring up their troop presence in the region in some places, but there's been no noticable shift away from Europe.

The largest change in posture in recent years was towards the Ukraine, those new divisions.

&gt;The way Russia hurts Europe is not by conventional warfare anymore, it's by hybrid warfare which is much cheaper and less obvious

Hybrid warfare is a moronic buzzword (second only to Gerasimov doctrine) that means nothing and everything, I'd suggest you stop using it for everyone's sake.

Now it basically means ""Russia doing something we don't like"", which could be all from political moves to military intervention. When you put it like that, it really can't be discussed in any meaningful way.

Empty rhetoric.

&gt; It is a woman who has without doubt committed a crime far worse than average and who has been against her host government.

Then it should be easy for the United Kingdom to prove guilt in a court of law based on the principles of a fair trial and due process. I don't want the government to tell me who is guilty of xyz and extrajudiciously dole out punishment. I want it proven in a court of law with public records of the proceedings. 

&gt; They have every right to take her citizenship away

That doesn't make it a just act. This isn't a justification at all but rather just a declarative statement of ability.

&gt; and it should not be the burden of the United Kingdom to prove the person with blood on their hands of a crime

Are you seriously arguing that a state shouldn't have to prove guilt before being able to administer punishments on its citizens?

&gt;  and to then have to spend the manpower and resources of having her in prison and likely dealing with the children. What she did was abhorrent and there must be no tolerance for it. 

Yes, it is the United Kingdom's responsibility to detain its criminals and deal with the aftermath of decisions that their citizens cause. It also bears this responsibility to its own (informal but internally and externally recognized) constitution. The UK just evaded it by taking away her citizenship, which defeats the whole point of having a codified list of rights and government operating principles if they can just ignore it and aren't held up to the fire for violating the rule of law.

They're making Bangladesh, Syria, and/or the Kurdistan unrecognized government deal with a now effectively stateless person who will never be allowed to be deported to their home nation unlike every other international criminal. European governments do this and wonder why there's such tension between them and the rest of the world.

&gt; The complete audacity to compare this to the Nuremberg Laws or Jim Crow. The absolute insanity. Not to mention what's the issue with taking away citizenship from dual citizenship holders?

Both started off as systems that undermined constitutionalism and liberal democracy by telling people that it's okay that certain people (or anybody in general) are denied rights based on conditions that are extralegal and extrajudicial. They're both took place in societies where human rights aren't seen as universal and unconditional.

The problem with taking away citizenship from dual citizens is that it promotes inequality through the law. If ""normal"" citizens don't have to worry about having their citizenship taken away even when they do the worst of the worst, then it shouldn't be used as a punishment against dual citizens either. If dual citizens can and will be punished harsher (**especially without trial**) than people with only a single citizenship, then they aren't *de jure* full citizens but second class citizens.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/i1a5vb/shamima_begums_return_to_britain_put_on_hold_as/fzwttvt/,JonF1,1596229075

&gt;  
&gt;(b) does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities;

5688,"&gt; If that's the attitude of the German people then who cares if they get steamrolled by Russia? 

International politics are not a zero-sum game.  Let's say that tomorrow the US just packs up and leaves NATO.  Gone.  Kaput.

There are a few possible paths forward here:

* Another great power jacks up their influence in the region, either through over military force or just aggressive diplomatic/economic manuevering.

* Europe federalizes to the point it can be a peer/near peer, military wise, to the US

* European nations individually increase their military strength substantially.

* European nations steam as before but just without the US influence or that of another great power.

A lot of Germans seem to think the last is how it would go, it baffles the hell out of me that Russia took a chunk of a land away from Ukraine the size of Belgium and is supporting an ongoing war and the Western Europeans just...don't care.

The rest are not in the interest of the United States.  Another near-peer/peer?  No, not at all.

Germany leveraging it's economic strength to substantially boost it's military and have an independent defence policy, along with other European nations? Also no.  We start to head into a Maersheimer realm of greater numbers fo military powerful nations entail greater risk of large conflicts.

Allowing another Great power be the one exerting influence over Europe?  Does anyone seriously think it's a good thing for the US if Russia or China being able to wield the sort of influence in Europe the US does?

And in a service-based economy, do you think many people would go to socialise with others in bars and pubs when that could be their death sentence or their loved ones'? do you think the tourism industry would be booming right now? how about all the industry built around those services?

Lockdown was harsh, and it caused a big contraction in the economy, but it saved a lot of it by managing to normalise everyday life for a sizeable portion of the population. And most of all, it was infinitely better than the alternative, which would mean a tanked economy plus no healthcare, plus several hundreds of thousands of dead, realistically millions if we account for the consequences of a collapsed healthcare.

5826,"Except there was daily briefings on the corona pandemic. The response from Trump was to shut down the borders, which is basically the power that is vested in the federal government. It's up to each state to decide how to approach the virus and the federal government is just there to help with coordination and supplying the states with emergency supplies, which they did at their request.

USA isn't just some nation where the President rules supreme and has all the power. Each state chooses their own government and are responsible for their own states response to disasters. The federal government is just there to help out when requested. Look at the rioting going on now for example. The federal government does not have the authority to just go in and stop the riots, unless they enter federal buildings or threaten federal buildings. Unless the state government request aid from the federal, all they can do is just sit back and watch and make plans for IF they get requested to help out.

What greatly harmed the US is that certain politicians started calling the travel ban from China a xenophobic move and that people instead should go to china town and enjoy life and celebrate the chinese new year rather than take precautions. Failure on state level such as NY where Cuomo placed sick people in nursing homes lead to a rapid spread to a risk group.

You also have the incentive to mark deaths as COVID where COVID deaths leads to more money, which leads to more reported deaths by COVID. This is due to the fact that a lot of hospitals weren't allowed to continue their elective treatments and therefor took a massive blow to their economies. A lot of the people that were reported dead by COVID wasn't really dying from COVID but underlying conditions such as cancer. While other nations don't report these as COVID due to no incentive to do so, this leads to two different ways to count deaths and of course it'll be inflated in the US.

Also, there's no ""ruling party"" in the US. Right now Congress is split with House of Representatives as a democratic majority and the Senate with republican majority and the executive which is lead by a republican. The President can only execute the laws and sign them. Without the Congress to pass new laws and senate ratifying them he can't exactly sign new laws.",,/r/europe/comments/i14ll0/eurostat_has_just_published_the_gdp_growth_rates/fzva30w/,Seppurs,1596207156

I played around a bit in excel after getting the seasonally adjusted growth series from the Spanish statistics office (www.ine.es).

[the data is *not* inflation adjusted](https://imgur.com/a/yavw9NM) and it yep, it extends all the way to the 2nd quarter of 2020 (excel is just skipping one out of two values in the x-axis)

They'll just come over and peacefully take your independence, which (from my experience talking to quite a number of people from Belarus over the years) most of you don't really care about all that much. Why should the military put up more than a token resistance against Russia, who for so many years was lauded as a ""brotherly nation"" by your dictator, and who most Belarusians don't really consider to be even a potential adversary? Fight against a much stronger military or potentially get a raise and join the new ""Union State army"". Hmm...
