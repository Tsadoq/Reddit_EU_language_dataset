They would probably do more if it weren't for your country. 

&gt; Heads of governments from Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have reacted coldly to the European Commission’s proposal to advance Frontex – the European Border and Coast Guard Agency – which the three Visegrad states have labelled “obsolete.”
&gt; 
&gt; **In his 2018 State of the Union speech, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the Commission, proposed a plan to increase staff and resources of the agency, in order to deal with irregular migrants as well as strengthening the EU’s external borders.** German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, during a bilateral meeting on the September 16, expressed their support for the proposal.
&gt; 
&gt; **However, Mr Juncker’s plan has met strong criticism from three of the four Visegrad countries (the fourth, Poland, hosts the headquarters of Frontex in Warsaw). During a joint session of the Czech and Slovak governments on September 17, the prime ministers of both countries said that extra funds for Frontex would be superfluous.** Instead, they advocated for EU funds to be allocated to individual member states, such as Malta, Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal. Andrej Babiš, head of the Czech government, further stressed the importance of using funds for cooperation with North Africa and Turkey to prevent economic migration from these regions.

I mean, I don't care, but I know that many people do care and I take into account their feeling aswell, it's not like I should care only about gay people feelings or whatever.

Legal partnership is the most a state can do, if they want word marriage in that, I see it more of a trolling rather than anything and I don't see why I should agree with people who just want to make other people feel bad or something.",,/r/europe/comments/fchtr2/putin_submits_plans_for_constitutional_ban_on/fjctbox/,Vyciauskis,1583235860

The most fair battle between humans, nations have began with the “best neutral referee” COVID-19 NCOV.

Too much Money, Power, Energy, Title, etc. for what if you cannot survive out of the NCOV COVID-19.

No anybody, no any nations can escape this  ultimate virus, they all have to face it and live with it, whether they  can still stay alive or not is another question.

This virus is 100% nature born after their  evolution because of man-made 5G mobile network and related. So you can  stop all the conspiracies this that, for no any nation government  benefit from this epidemic. This virus can able to fly and swim at the  same time.

There is a lot of secret information about  this virus but I am not going to telling you even if you have money,  power, energy, etc. One thing I can reveal to you that: no any machine,  drug, ritual of any kinds, super abilities gods can able to save you,  for only you can save you from this deadly virus !!!

God give curse and cure at the same time.

I do not want to talk about the Bible or any ancient prophecies for they have level above your understanding &amp; your wisdom.

God gave the **curse** is the NCOVID2019.  
God gave the **cure** is the Savior Messiah Mahdi Maitreya, any name.

So to all the rich money people, elites,  elders, etc.: if you do not seeking and asking me for help, there is no  any other choice &amp; way out of this crazy epidemic event. And many of  you are going to die for sure. This battle is not about strength, it  all about knowledge &amp; wisdom, so all of the textbook, knowledge you  have gained in your life are mostly useless and will not going to work  for this ultimate virus the NCOVID2019.

All the ingredients are already on the table. It is now all up to your choice &amp; action.

This time I not giving any entities any deadline anymore. I will do what is suppose to do and done.

The more your censoring/removing my posts the slower the cure will appear.

Now it all about go with the Savior or go against the Savior.

Only go with me you will able to survive, go against me like the Chinese Government will only lead to dead.

Choose wisely &amp; quickly.

No any “player” including some thousand  years old beings on the field know about the beautiful kingdom of the  Messiah yet, for I have only sealed it but have not yet reveal it  publicly.

Will you able to survive, able to see and live in the **Ultimate World of all Universe**?

Best Regard,  
**The Savior The Lord Messiah Mahdi Maitreya Kalki Udumbara Flower Anyname**

Essentially, a long time ago Sweden only had a very small piece of land on the western coast where Gothenburg is today while Denmark and Norway had the rest. They built a huge fortress to defend this section of land. Right after they finished building it the danish took it over. Then 100 years later Sweden took it back, but then the Danish took it over again after 20 years and burned it down. Shortly after Gustav Vasa took over the region again and decided to build an even larger fortress and when the second fortress was finished, you guessed it, the danish took it over again. Then they said that they could buy back the fortress for an insane amount of money and Sweden bought back the fortress bought the fortress they built themselves. And then the danish took it over again and, you guessed it, sold back the fortress to Sweden for an insane amount of money.

210,"Civil unions in the UK carry almost the exact same rights as marriage - there was an exclusion over spousal pensions, but it was overturned by the courts after a few years.

Gay marriage was a fringe issue here in the UK - in the 70's and 80's gay people were fighting for acceptance, and the activists doing so didn't want acceptance on the basis that they would accept all the trappings of a straight lifestyle. They wanted to end workplace discrimination and end [Section 28](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/cacc0b40-c3a4-473b-86cc-11863c0b3f30).

The 90's was a watershed decade for gay people in the UK - at the beginning of the decade no-one was out, and by the end of it almost everyone was. Suddenly gay people were living together openly and hardly needed protection in the workplace any more - what they needed was the right to adopt and protection for their partners from their homophobic families in the event of their illness or death. The Civil Partnership Act was passed in 2004.

Clearly it's homophobic to pass legislation stating that marriages are inherently heterosexual, and clearly these are attempts to deny gay people rights. But I don't think there has ever been a string campaign for gay marriage here in the UK because there has never been strong opposition (it was passed in 2013).",,/r/europe/comments/fchtr2/putin_submits_plans_for_constitutional_ban_on/fjchvuw/,strolls,1583220781

You could say the naturally-female participants are having their ""right to fairness"" infringed upon if you allow it, so in this case it's preferable not to. So sure, ""everyone should be treated equally"" may not be an absolute thing 100% of the time, but it takes very specific circumstances for it not to apply, and there's no reason whatsoever why it shouldn't apply in the case of gay marriage as it doesn't affect anyone else negatively. Or at least I can't think of a single way in which it does... well, other than bigots getting mad about it, but that's their own personal problem.

I mean, by that same ""logic"" someone could say that since men and women should have equal rights, men should be allowed in women's sports too, and I think everyone who's halfway sane can agree that would be moronic.

So by ignoring those 20% and focusing on the rest, they can reverse their demographic death spiral without disturbing liberal progress. With 20% being childless, the other 80% need to have 2.6 children per couple to hit overall 2.1 replacement level.

597,"Only because the definition of medical debt/bankruptcy was extremely broad. If you lost income because of illness and filed bankruptcy it fell under medical bankruptcy. Even Europe doesn't necessarily have 100% disability pay+bonus. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5865642/

&gt;In these studies, people who had gone bankrupt were asked whether they’d experienced health-related financial stress such as substantial medical bills or income loss due to illness. People were also asked whether they went bankrupt due to medical bills. People who reported any of these events were described as having experienced a medical bankruptcy. This approach assumes that whenever a person who reports having substantial medical bills experiences a bankruptcy, the bankruptcy was caused by the medical debt. 

Is it fair to say that every time someone experiences a medical bill and then declares bankruptcy that they went bankrupt because of medical debt? Is it fair to say anyone who has a big car bill and declares bankruptcy it's because of the car bill? It's hard to determine a ""cause"" of bankruptcy because if you've been spending every dime you make on frivolous things and then get hit with an unexpected big bill is it really the big bill that caused your bankruptcy? 

The study found a 4% increase in bankruptcies after hospitalization not a 60% increase. There's not no effect, but large medical expenses do not have a large effect on the rate of bankruptcy. There are definitely financial strains from going to the hospital but rarely does it lead to bankruptcy. I think its just as bad when people peddle bombastic nonsense that doesn't match reality as when people try and pretend the issue doesn't exist at all. 

And all of this is fairly irrelevant to this kind of statistic. Even if every bankrupt person couldn't go to the hospital and be treated (they can) it'd still be a blip when it comes to overall preparedness since they about to less than 1% of the total population.",,/r/europe/comments/fcbzk6/the_uk_is_rated_as_having_the_second_best_health/fjbtmph/,demonica123,1583201151

As you said, they aren't running. That's why there's very few Syrians on the border right now. 

Most or at least many of them would rather stay in Turkey because they've established their lives in Turkey already. But if Erdogan takes the crisis to the next level, Turkey might cancel their residence permits.

Exactly. This was the main premise of my argument, and it seems like, unfortunately, dehumanization has become the modus operandi of political extremists.

&gt;I hope people can come to their senses and start thinking rationally  rather than always being extreme, on both sides, people were talking  about how extreme and polarized politics is becoming in the USA but it  seems like we're not doing much better here in Europe. By looking at  some of the replies I don't have much hope, but whatever

Extremist voices tend to be over-represented online. I find solidarity in the fact that you spoke up. The only way we're going to be able to discuss and solve the issue of the mass displacement of people is by thinking rationally. It's a complex system of push and pull factors, and it cannot be summarized by ad hominem attacks.

For now. Unfortunately due to Greece having a lot of coastal borders, there will always be migrants that are able to reach Greece. Eventually Greece will once again ask the other EU members to take responsibility for some of the asylum seekers they're hosting. 

And that's when the solidarity with Greece will end faster than it began. People and countries stand behind Greece as long as they do the dirty work for them. 

It will then be that ungrateful Erdogan appeasing and greekophobic asshole Germany that jumps in and volunteers to take the majority of these asylum seekers. Like we always do.

803,"1. Common view towards R&amp;D, there are companies and institutes  that produce results, however comparing to the potential that there is, a lot of it is squandered simply because there's no real will or the right attitude. There are engineers/scientists (men and women) who would love to work on such projects, it's damn depressing to younger engineers that many of them will find work in QA, SQA or tech support to purchase/selling office (considering the nature of work no pay is good enough), and they can be considered lucky for having a job. IT is the only exception where there is interest.

2. There aren't many companies so whatever funding there is available (government or EU), gets to the bigger names first (better projects and a bit of lobbying), leaving very little room for smaller companies to get recognition or funding for their projects, which in return further demotivate the management to consider investment.

3. Companies do run with dummy projects that were never intended to be fully operational in an attempt to get that funding. Some do succeed in getting it.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/fc8xyq/sweden_ranked_the_eus_most_innovative_nation/fjaogoe/,KnightOfOldEmpire,1583177513

Poles are the the same, Ukrainians are Russians. Ukrainian national identity was artificially created by communists in order to undermine Russian influence. 

&gt; And Russia has hardly on the brink of destruction every half a century. The only time that was really close when Germany invaded in WW2, but that aside Russia did not nearly do as bad as you make it out to be.

&gt; The problem in Russia is it's people. Russia also has these authocratic tendencies, during tsarist times, communism and now Putin. Always needs a big man at the top to tell Russians what to do.

The second source talk about how eu is not spending enough?

They are contradictory in that manner, and do not explain why / how Europe is behind.

It has been obvious since 2015 that plenty of asylum seekers don't actually have a right to asylum. Just look at eurostat statistics, there's no need to do surveys or anything. 


But that's beyond the point. You still have to handle their asylum requests. Because even someone from Pakistan could be persecuted in their country. Refugee status isn't actually for people fleeing wars. It's for people that are persecuted in their countries. 

That's why you check their applications, decide them and then you deport the ones that don't have a right to asylum.

The first killings of civilians in BiH actually happened in late 1991 in Herzegovina, and they targeted Croats. But that was done by JNA units so it wasn't really the Bosnian Serb fault per se. The bigger issue was of course the ethnic cleansing of Croats in Krajina, and the people in power in RS were politically on the same positions as those in Krajina.

&gt;Im glad that worked out lol
And no, you're lying, Croats went for the 3hd option = independent Herzeg Bosnia,where they had their own ethnic cleansing campaign.

Yeah, later. And it was a stupid decision. The Croat-Bosniak war never should have happened. Our whole foreign policy was based on recognition of the borders of Yugoslav republics and then we shat on that because Tuđman and Šušak wanted to play warlords.",,/r/europe/comments/fbqsv0/on_march_1st_1992_64_percent_of_eligible_voters/fj9hjo1/,Magistar_Idrisi,1583148698

1210,"&gt; that Turkish media are not trustworthy and that's a fact and at least for me.

That is a fact for me as well, despite being Turkish myself. That's why I was trying to highlight the fact that it wasn't Turkish media.

&gt; you do have a problem with the asnwer of Greece calling those news fake

I didn't call anything Greece says ""fake"", I am merely providing some food for thought. Every media has their biases, none of them are propaganda free. And there are a whole lot of Greek users around here, simply sharing greek tweets left and right, not even news sources for their propaganda. I was trying to bring attention to that.

&gt; but you actually have no problem at considering those news true without any proof, with a random media being the source

I trust BBC more, a third party media in this conflict, than I trust any of the Turkish or Greek sources.

&gt; I have already stated that Police and army are not allowed and they have not be given the order to shoot or use violence against anyone.

Nobody talked about the orders. Misshaps happen. And they happen more often than you can imagine. Water canons are relatively safe. What happens if a water canon pushes someone in a way that they fall and hit their head in a corner? Greece was already doing warning fires since early yesterday. Would it really be that surprising that one cop or military officer accidentally made a mistake in the middle of all the pressure?

Second, it still *feels* that this not about immigrants in Turkey as it is about Turkish operations in Syria. I don't know how you feel about it, but seeing so many Greek soldiers on the border cannot be a good sign; there seems to be an escalation with Greece making a border accident more likely for no good reason.

That's not the case. Most asylum seekers are young males which is the most ""criminal"" of gender/age groups there is. If you compare them to their peers, the asylum seekers are on paar with natives.

Small caveats with this, it also depends on the specific subgroup of asylum seekers. Those from Iraq and Syria are below average, because 1 conviction of a crime can cost them their asylum chance. People from North Africa on the other hand are above average, as their chance for asylum is close to zero, so commiting a crime doesn't matter.

Second caveat, that doesn't mean a mass migration of disproportional many males is a good thing. But this is a separate question.

1393,"&gt;First of all you can neither measure the willingness nor the ability to integrate.

You can assess it far better than their vulnerability.

&gt;Which means you first select the ones that need urgent medical care, then the ones that have chronic illnesses. After that it's the ones that are victims of terror, rape or human trafficking. If you've resettled all of those you pick unaccompanied minors and then women who travel alone

I never said that vulnerability shouldn't be a criterium, just not the only one. 

&gt;Let's not make a mockery out of the asylum system. It doesn't exist so you can recruit people that will grow your GDP. It exists to protect people from persecution. 

And it's failing at that. The government considers countries like Afghanistan safe despite all the obvious evidence pointing in the opposite direction. Selecting people based on vulnerability is great in theory, but it's practically a disaster.

&gt;but this does not involve selection by arbitrary means either.

My sweet summer child, we already select based on arbitrary means. We simply pretend unsafe countries are safe in order to categorize people based on that. We are also relying on a shitload of things we basically just have to take people's word for. One thing where right-wing dipshits and people on the left who work with refugees agree on is that the system is failing at correctly assessing people's vulnerability.

All in all, I think it's a little unfair that you accuse me of being low on the moral scale. Believe it or not, I'm an extremely empathetic person. I just happen to see the immense contrast between theory and praxis, and that tells me we need to be more pragmatic.

A system where we consider both egoistic and altruistic aspects when it comes to immigration sounds not as clean as your theory, but I can assure you that the praxis would be less dirty than it already is.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/fby09c/euturkey_border_crisis_megathread/fj9ccfr/,Kafka_Valokas,1583141884

In addition, Turkey invades to neighboring countries (Syria/Iraq) because they want their borders to be expanded. They dream of a great Turkey (Ottoman empire). The role of a Sultan in the area. This creates more refugees and then Erdogan demands billions from Europe as help. Turkey is responsible for this. And Europe as well cause they are aware of all these. Turkey even advice smugglers and immigrants to tear up the boats while they enter at EU/Greek sea territory. The EU law, states that once they reach European land/sea they must be saved. Turkey knows that and fully takes advantage of this. The Dublin agreement is so hypocritical and so unfair for Greece. It states that if a refugee or an illegal immigrant is not accepted in EU, he must go back to the country he ENTERED. NOT the country he came from! Only immigrant pushbacks are allowed between Greece and Turkey, but Turkey does not co-operate even though they have signed the Dublin agreement. In realityTurkey has agreed only for the cash. If Turkey has cancelled the agreement of Dublin, why should Greece keep the agreement in action? The Dublin agreement must be cancelled YESTERDAY. Greece has never invaded to other nations in modern history, but yet, while trying to stand up on its feet from the economic crisis, holds all the burden. Merkel  has clearly a huge responsibility on this, because all these years she was paying Erdogan with billions for this matter (from our European taxes) and supported Turkey by selling guns to this country. A fascist country that even has put in prison Turkish civilians that oppose to Erdogan. She is so dangerous! The German parliament has to do sth about Mrs Merkel. You can’t fund with guns a nation like Turkey. The funds from Europe may have frozen this year, but all the previous years Turkey was taking advantage of that. The damage is done. Now we Greeks we have to show the world our “bad” side or else we will be packed.

First of all, the cause of refugees isn’t Turkish-Coalition incursions inside Syria, people flees from Syria because regime and Russian planes bombs cities indiscriminately, Turkey getting out of Syria won’t do shit for the refugee problem, the civil war should be solved diplomatically.

Secondly, every official Syrian refugee inside Turkey (around 3.7 millions) gets around 200€ a month, which makes a 740 million euros a month, agreement or not, with these numbers you should be able to understand what kind of a burden sheltering refugees in a humane way is, 3 billion euros that EU gave Turkey is nothing compared to what Turkey already spent, which is 40 billion dollars.

Turkey can’t sustain the 3 million more refugees would come from Idlib if the Turks weren’t dying there to protect their homes from absurd amount of bombardment made by Assad and Russia. If EU doesn’t want to support Turkey on this, of course Turks will say “open the gates.”

What war am I talking about? I'm talking about African and Middle Eastern disputes among the populations themselves that they take with, along with the general condemnation of Western politics and culture.

They are the war. They are taking it with. Their arrogance is already the cause of geopolitical chaos. They might even start more wars. They're used as fucking leverage by Turkey.

The majority of Syria is safe, ISIS has been practically defeated, and they are currently saved from the supposed war torn living conditions they fled from. But “fuck Turkey”, says their mindstate, “hurray lets go to Greece”.

And then suddenly, for no reason at all, people voted Hitler into power.

Yes. The Turkish Army shouldn’t be there. But there’s nothing to be done if there’s 1.5 million refugees leaving Idlib due to Assads rule. If Assad takes control of the entire Syria, where will the anti-Assad refugees go? They definitely won’t go to Syria due to the fact that they left due to Assads rule in the first place.

Anatolia isn’t a dumping ground for Europe to dump refugees in. If you are worried about the millions of refugees in Europe + Turkey, then you should be happy that Turkey is legitimately trying to create a place where they can actually go.

Just because the US has historically received a lot of immigrants doesn't mean the US has no sovereign right to protect itself from illegal immigration.

&gt; I think the US should have almost open borders but that this would be a disaster for Europe.

Open borders is already a disaster for the US. There is a ticking demographical time bomb in the US caused by illegal immigration and chain migration and massive family sizes among Latinos in the US. It's a means by the left to culturally destroy American holdouts who still value the constitution, value our history, and oppose socialism.

Unlike past immigrant groups, Latinos in the US have almost no loyalty to the US and they don't need to, because their demographic group sees itself as distinct and part of their home countries and when they congregate and become the majority in any area, they act as a group completely separate from mainstream American. This means they have no loyalty to the US, no desire to adopt American values, and will vote based on the well being of their group and their home countries. This results in Latinos, especially Mexicans, being foreign agents rather than actual Americans. 

Illegal immigration in the US is destroying the country slowly but surely by diluting the voice of actual Americans and handing over the country to foreigners who have completely dissimilar cultures and values. The left in the US, who are traitors, love this because it's a way by which they import their constituents and voters from foreign countries to dilute the voting power of Americans who oppose their agenda.

At the exact time psychopaths like you are calling for open borders, there is also a huge leftist SJW narrative that constantly race baits and convinces minorities in the US to hate white people. This is extremely dangerous and is by design. The left in the US couldn't sell their socialist propaganda when the vast majority of Americans were culturally similar and self-dependent. So the left's solution is to import hordes of people from different cultures and constantly fill their eyes and ears with anti-American propaganda and tell them that they deserve a piece of somebody else's pie, so they'll vote for politicians that are basically selling themselves as revolutionaries.

1) Every single country in history was formed by subjugating or displacing other people. That's pretty much the definition of a country. One group takes the land from another group. People like you are absolutely brainwashed when you think that you can apply this stupid double-standard to the US but no one else. 

2) The US is a sovereign nation. Your empty historical critique of the US doesn't change the fact that the US is a country, with borders, a culture, and the right to protect itself from being invaded. The land the US has IS ""rightfully"" ours. 

The people who you think actually ""rightfully"" possess the US are who? Mexico? You mean the country that itself was founded by stealing land from natives? Or is it the tribes that never had countries or borders in what is now the US but were constantly killing each other for territory before Europeans came to the Americas?

Piss off with your disingenuous, idiotic propaganda. What is actually going on is that you're an anti-American idiot who fantasizes about harm being done to the US by illegal immigration. The reason you defend Europeans who want to protect their countries from illegal immigration but think the US is not worthy of the same national sovereignty, has nothing to do with some historical sense of justice, but it's just because you're a slimy anti-American moron who loves the US being criticized for shit that Europeans are immune from criticism for.

World Wars wiped out those wealth, but Europeans were still the same Europeans who knew how to produce wealth and form a good state. Poor Congolese people never actually had a chance to think about those stuff while being forced to slavery and starvation. 

In the case of Greeks, they learned about those stuff from Western Europeans who also provided them large financial support. Greeks weren't oppressed by the Ottomans the way Africans, Middle Easterners, Indians etc were oppressed by Western Europeans. The Ottoman oppression was more of a cultural one, which is still bad but nothing like colonization.

but aren't there ways to adjust IF they wanted to adjust?

Same like you I'd call myself a leftist but I more and more recognize traits in me I really don't like when thinking about such topics.

I'm a gay guy, ftm trans* and a dog owner and the hate thrown at me by migrants sometimes is just not bearable.

In the last 3 years I had 5 situations where I almost did get beaten up by people that barely were able to speak german, 2 times when I was walking the neighbourhood with my partner, 1 times because a group of (what I think) muslims didn't like my dog barking at their kids (that were running towards him screaming, barking at him and trying to hit him with a stick while jumping around him screaming) and 2 times simply because I was at the wrong place at the wrong time.



I lived in migrant heavy areas like Neukölln and Kreuzberg 20 years ago without much trouble and overall it was a more or less friendly getting along with each other but I feel like things have changed a lot already and are in the process of changing even more.

I even moved to a more ""german"" neighbourhood to actively avoid ""potential bad situations"" by now and this would have been unthinkable for me 20 years ago since I -as said- never had any issues back then in Kreuzberg or Neukölln even.

The thing is, I barely can talk about this with anyone. Not only do I hate myself for having those thoughts in the first place, I also do get a lot of flack for expressing them when around my leftist friends.

Whenever I meet the ""average Joes"" in the dog park for example, those guys sometimes are fully racist (the kind of people that think the AfD would be the ""good guys"") and that's not a position I do support in any way and hence don't want to express my concerns there either to not give them any more fuel for their already heavily toxic and hateful stance.

The thing is, as much as I try to keep those thoughts away I cannot really ignore them either. I feel like things ARE changing and not in a good way.",,/r/europe/comments/fbuer3/greek_civilians_stop_boat_full_of_migrants_and/fj85p9r/,HealthyCarrot,1583105721

Honestly it's not. Nato covers all the EU countries with any real danger of invasion. The seat is a question because the UK even blocked wording at the UN where it might imply it's acting without their say.

'
The Turkish government has long complained that the EU has not paid out the €6 billion sum in full, and that the EU is dragging its feet on the accession negotiations and other agreements. The European Commission has begged to differ, claiming the money has been paid out in full — albeit to refugee aid organizations and not directly to the Turkish state.
'

'
Still, the EU has yet to fully implement the measures it agreed to at the time. For instance, despite massive financial assistance from Brussels, Greece remains woefully incapable of processing asylum applications from Syrian refugees in a timely fashion. The entire procedure can drag on for months, even years.
'

'
To complicate matters, many EU member states have been unwilling to accept adequate numbers of those Syrian refugees already in Turkey. ""If the EU doesn't change that soon the deal will collapse,"" said Gerald Knaus, a migration expert, in a recent interview. Knaus advised Austria and the EU in 2015 and 2016, and is largely seen as the architect of the EU-Turkey deal.

They differ slightly on the estimates, but its around about 80% of people who arrive in the EU eventually get granted asylum.

Your article doesn't contradict that refugees didn't get asylum elsewhere, only that under Dublin they shouldn't (but as we already established, Dublin had collapsed at this point).

&gt; most of the refugees were in Turkey for many years, but suddenly in 2015 ""everyone"" moved to Europe. Again there was no reason for a massive, unorganized move of people that lead to a crisis, as the refugees were already out of the danger zone.

Most of the refugees in late 2015 did not come directly from Turkey. They was a sudden uptick in violence in the North of Syria in early 2015 which had previously been relatively ""safe"". That new wave could only get to two places, Lebanon or Turkey, both of which were already struggling to cope with the number they had. Lebanon in particular was very badly hit and for a time you were statistically more likely to die from malnutrition or disease in a camp in Lebanon than you were back in Syria. Europe had until this point refused to take any refugees, but essentially it reached breaking point and once they were forced to open their doors they took the full force of the overflow.

Many analysis that look back on the crisis point out that if the EU had accepted refugees earlier, rather than bottling them all up in Turkay and Lebanon, it probably wouldn't have had a major crisis, as it could have controlled the numbers in a slow stready flow. But thats mindsight for you.

&gt; Israel is a signatory of Geneva's Convention and Protocol and it also borders Syria, but it has taken no refugees. The same goes for Russia which isn't far from Turkey and is also a signatory. Even countries like Azerbaijan

Israel is loathed my most Arabs including Syrians. They'd be the last place any of them would try to seek refuge. Russia took in about 300,000 refugees, the second highest of any European country (after Germany). Azerbaijan is almost impossible to get to from Syria. The direct route would be Turkey -&gt; Armenia -&gt; Azerbaijan but the Turkish/Armenian border is completely closed, as is the Armenian/Azerbaijan border. The alternative way would be through Iraq and Iran (equally as bad, especially considering that would be straight through the heart of ISIS territory).

&gt; The problem in Europe arises because, both migrants and refugees select a small number of countries as their destination.

Refugees generally don't choose, they just go wherever they heard they're going to ba accepted. Germany and Sweden in particular invited refugees to come, so they did.

&gt; Things would be much better if more countries shared the burden.

Applications are purposefully delayed so it takes months or even years to get an interview. During that time while you're waiting they make it as difficult as possible to get support, often relying on NGO's to do all the work for them, and you're kept right on the border of a warzone which is far from safe. Of course, if you get desperate waiting they'll happily let you pass through Turkey to go and be someone elses problem.

2023,"Erdogan hater opposition here, got some words to say:

Don't worry guys, Turkey just wanted to prove that we can use Refugees as aweapon. Most likely that issue will be resolved in couple days.

I know that doesn't look good to Europeans. Some of them already downvoted me. But there are reasons that happened. And if u want to avoid further issuses like that, you better try to understand why we are having this ongoing.

**Why Turkey is backing those mostly jihadist rebels?**

First of all, those people being jihadist doesn't really mean anything. It is middle-east and most groups are jihadists. I wish In future we can make peace with Kurds. They are literally the best sociecty here since they are secular, thats why west is supporting them.

Rest of the people are pretty jihadists. The ones fighting with Assad like Hezbollah, or significant amount of people in SAA. ( Syrian Arab Army)

a rebel being jihadist is a common thing there.

Turkey got 3  reasons to do that:

1. Avoiding new Refugee wawe

Those are the most radical rebels since Idlib is their last Stronghold. The more Assad moved further to north, the more people escaped from him to north. Now, If Turkey decides to go back to border and leave these people, They will drop their weapons, take their children and women, among with the other people who ran away from Assad before, will march into Turkey Border.

Turkey has no chance of dealing with 3million more refugee and that certainly is also Europe's concern. If a new 3million+ refugees start walking ( and those are the most radical ones... )

those people eventually will go into Europe as well. This is our **Mutual Interest** with EU to stop that refugee wawe. Avoiding new refugee wawe is the main public reason.

2) Buffer Zone

If Turkey can get a Buffer zone, ( that can be autonomous or ruled multi-national etc, don't see that like neo-ottomanist land dream )

We can make some construction there, so we can move some of our refugees to that buffer zone and also those people wouldn't have to run away and they stay on the other side of the border. Again, when it comes to refugees, its our **Mutual Interest** with EU. This is second public reason.

3) Some control over M4 Highway

Russia is trying to increase its power in Mediterranean. With ports of Latakia, they look like achived it. USA doesn't want to give the whole power to Russia there, M4 highway feeds that city. We shouldn't leave entire M4 highway to Russian control to decrease their power their.

This is not just EU, It is **Mutual Interest** of NATO. It is most likely a private reason there that we have promised to USA behind closed doors before.

**What happened lately?**

Turkey wanted some land around idlib, a buffer zone, to make some constructions and move some of the refugees there. In sochi and other agreements, we seemed like we were gonna achive it. But eventually Russians claimed we broke the sochi agreement and they started their march into Idlib.

In Seraqib/Idlib, There were many outgoing battles all the day. By evening, Turkish backed rebels won in Saraqib. Russians probably got mad, and they attacked our HQ, killed at least 35 people, they didn'T even let us use helicopters to evacuate our woundeds.

**Why Russia Did this?**

They want the M4 highway for their ports in Latakia, Thats why they accused us of breaking sochi agreement, and they started agression. Anyone still asks why Russia is an agressor? Well, They are being Russia. They are always agressors. Look at Ukraine, Look at Georgia. You can look even deeper if you want...

**Why Turkey had to Open Borders?**

Even though Turkey is defending our mutual interests with EU and NATO, because of our SHIT IMAGE in western countries caused by Erdogan's greed, we get very little international support.

Turkey tried to get that support with soft-power: diplomacy first. Failed. Russians probably saw this as a weakness and they started their agression to Idlib.

Eventually, we got left alone by West againts Russia, even though we were defending our mutual interests.

Diplomacy didn't work, and Turkey had to try something harder.

Now we are blackmailing, bullying Europe. Giving a clear message. Refugees are our mutual problem and Turkey has done much much more than all Europe.

Some might say that you gave us money. First: money doesn't solve all problems.

Second: you can divide 4 million people to 3 billion Euro ( that we have got by now ) yourself. Taxpayers are dealing with Syrians and that war. Europes financial help is a joke. ( I am kinda okey with that though, since economy is shit, Erdogan will lose next election )

I can tolerate money as an Erdogan Hater here. But on the battleground, we need more help from EU.

Thats why we had to do that after Russia destroyed our HQ and killed at least 35 soldiers.

**What is gonna happen now?**

Looks like that move actually worked. Some might claim that refugees are pawns of Erdogan. I doub it. They are much more powerful than pawns. We have got 4 million and couple thousands solved our problem already, it seems.

For 2 days, Turkey is destroying SAA forces, shooting anything moves with armed drones, and Russia literally is doing nothing.

Most likely your European Leaders "" made some phone calls "" and gave us this. And there is an ongoing patriot bargain there.

To get more support from Europe and Nato, Turkey had to do this. Sorry for that. But we have no choise. If oppostion ruled the country at the moment, we would still do the same.

**Who's fault is this?**

Syrian Civil war is happening for 9 years. I think we are all guilty. As a Turkish citizen I agree that we are guilty.

But Europe is not angel and they should take more responsibility.

If EU gave their supports to us before, that incident wouldn't occur.

**What were EU thinking about Russia ?**

Trump is right about his criticism on Europe about military defence. Looks like Europe doesn't want his hands to be dirty and they want to escape from Russia forever. And your leaders are making Russia even more agressive, more dangerous and more powerful everyday. You can't escape from Russia forever. I have no idea what EU is thinking about aggressor Russia.

**What were EU thinking about Refugees?**

My assumption is: Your boomer generation tend to beileve that Turkey is desert, we are pretty similar with arabs since we share same religion, we ride camels etc.

None of this is true.

I think EU expected Syrians to adapt Turkey eventually.

Unfortunetely, Arabs and Turks hate each other and this will never happen. Imagine the tension between Turks and Kurds. We can adapt to each other every day despite of that. Arabs are really a hard case. We can't get along with those people.

Their culture is so unaccaptable for even Turkish people.

Racial Tension in Turkey increases tremendously between refugees and Turks. So that "" adaption "" will never happen.

And we can't control their reproduction as well.

for fucks sake someone give them condoms... Their birth rate is higher than Turks.

**My final note:**

Those are hard times, hard issues. Especially with a shit leader like Erdogan, everything is even harder.

But EU certainly should take more responsibilities about refugees.

If we don't do anything, if you don'T do anything, you will just postpone the apocalypse. We have to find a way to solve that problem. Turkey can't hold those people forever.

Like the idea of a buffer zone for those people in Syria which Turkey offered, EU should start doing things to solve it.

Otherwise, Turkey will collapse, and then EU will collapse.

Hating Erdogan is not an excuse to not take responsibilities. Even though its hard to get along with Erdogan, Europe has to try his best for our mutual interests.

I hope I have explained myself.

Which means the Syrian refugees now have a large incentive to enter the EU before Turkey deports them back to Assad-controlled Syria. 

There's zero chance to prevent that many asylum seekers from entering Greece. The current situation is basically a photo OP for Erdogan. He picked some angry asylum seekers and sent them to the Greek border, so the press takes dangerous photos, which should convince the EU that the threat is real. Once the Turkish orchestrated phase is over, the migrants will quickly realize that their chance to reach Lesvos and other Greek islands is much larger.

The shipping container city is a god damn mess as well. Wall to wall rickety bunk beds and a sanitation system that's simply a joke. Either there's barely any water for washing or the toilets are overflowing yet again. You can smell that place from a mile away. During the summer, there's regular ambulance deployments, because the people in the containers are passing out from the heat. Infections and diseases are also a regular occurence.

Locals at this point probably don't care whose fault this is, they don't care if they are legitimate asylum seekers or if their claims for asylum are fake.

The only think they can understand after 5 years of continuous migrant arrivals is that they have been left alone to carry a burden that's beyond their limits.

If no one offers a solution, I guess it seems logical to them that they should take the law in their hands.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Unimportantly, if those people are refugees or just migrants, there is a law we uphold in our democracies. Following that we have no choice than to help them for time-being.

The fact that failed asylum seekers are not deported and when it happens it takes many years, is what intensifies the problem.

So basicly there were a de facto war on the ground. Turks avoided Russians all day while they were hitting targets, Russia was doing the same.

But when Turks have won the Saraqib, Russia most likely got mad.

As a European, what do you prefer? Turkey cuts his support to rebels? What do you think going to happen after that? Can't u see? your hate of Turks makes you blind rationally.

The moment Turkey decides to go to its own border,

1. up to 3 million refugees ( and they are the last/most radical rebels ) will march into Turkey, all those rebels will drop their weapons and run from assad, that happened many times before, but this time, there is not last stronghold of rebels. There is Turkish border instead. and since Assad will get the whole control there, dreams of moving some of the syrians to back to syria will fail as well.

Turkey has no chance of controling up to 10 million refugees.   
Eventually they will flow into Europe.

2)Russia will get massive power there, Russian activities and   
agression will be on Mediterranean next years. EU and NATO   
certainly doesn't want that either.

2290,"I know this dude is talking about the border, but the Greek government itself also ""invaded"" its own islands (Chios and Lesvos) with half of the entire country's riot police, in the middle of the night, who then proceeded to roam around destroying property and injuring Greek citizens for 3 days.

The plan was to beat the islanders into submission because they were protesting against the construction of ""closed camps"" (prisons) for the refugees in remote places with no plans of extradition or integration. Pretty much every single person agreed this was not a good idea, from right wingers who wanted them gone, to left wingers who didn't want them shackled, to everyone else in between, including the local government.

Of course, the media, led by ERT (the government channel) are spinning this like the islanders rioting and their thugs resolving the crisis and the only scenes they've shown are pretty much heavily edited footage cut to only show the citizens fighting back.

I should mention that at some point halfway through the ordeal, citizens stormed the hotel where the riot police were staying, attacked some of them and threw their clothes out.

The Greek government has finally acknowledged that the British Museum is the lawful owner of the “Elgin Marbles”. That, at least, is the logical conclusion of the recent news that Greece has dropped its legal claim to the Parthenon Sculptures.

The surprise announcement came only 48 hours after Amal Clooney and the team at London’s Doughty Street Chambers sent the Greek government a 150-page report admitting that there was only a 15% chance of their success in a British court, and that Greece should consider pursuing the claim at the International Court of Justice. However, quite understandably, the Greek government has decided that what Clooney is really saying is that they have no case.

The Syriza government is keenly aware that British courts are recognized the world over for their experience in resolving international disputes, including those involving British interests and institutions. So, quite reasonably, the new Greek government has concluded that an international court will probably not reach a different conclusion. Nikos Xydakis, culture minister, has therefore announced that Greece will drop its legal claim and pursue “diplomatic and political” avenues instead.  

This is unsurprising, as — contrary to the widespread misconception — there was nothing illegal about the way in which Lord Elgin saved the Parthenon Sculptures from acute ongoing destruction. The mauling had started when the Greek church smashed up a large number of the ancient temple’s carvings in the fifth century. The Venetians then blew up chunks of the building in 1687. And in the 1800s, when Lord Elgin arrived in Athens, the occupying Ottomans were grinding the sculptures up for limestone and using them for artillery target practice.",,/r/europe/comments/fbtfgy/historians_call_for_remains_of_napoleon_iii_to_be/fj6ex6t/,Emergency-Sport,1583069702

I oppose the idea of using humans as a weapon, that is using immigrants as a threat to Europe to try and get what you want. This whole situation is very complicated, and while I do not support the way Turkish government has acted for the last years, you must know Turkish history and demographics to understand why Erdogan (who is supported by half the population, who think the same way he does) acts this way.

Turkey and Syria has been adversaries for many reasons since decades, and Turkey has unfortunately played itself into a corner. Turkey holds close to 4 million immigrants as of now, and wouldn't be able to take in anymore. However, it seems as if it is going to have to. That's why Turkey is trying to force Europe into taking more immigrants. I do think that Europe should be accepting some of the Syrian immigrants, but Turkey should have achieved this by diplomacy.

For me, Turkey has all the rights to defend its borders, but I think it was wrong to ever step into Syrian soil. Greece also has the right to defend its borders, and naturally will and should defend its borders against illegal trespassers.

So 1600 pepole that are already married to each other stack on top of it 2nd tier marraige with family B. But not to confuse - it's not a marriage ""AB"" with 3100 people. They are still two separate marriages/family, but only married to each other on the 2nd tier (think inception). But since marriage, even on 2nd tier, shouldn't be limited to only two... ~~people~~ 1st tier marriages, so we have 1600 2nd tier marriages (each of them 1600 people married) married to each other.

Strength in numbers. This situation and problem will not disappear. It will only get worse. No nations can avoid it. Only possibly delay, by throwing the nations further forward in the flow under the bus. Which then results in that forward nation collapsing, buckling or as has happened, just letting the flow pass through in hope of further nations having to share the burden.

Only way we realistically can survive this is pooling resources. Spread the force of the flow over greater constant area, so that there isn't nation buckling pressure spikes in the flow. The Force will happen, it is driven by factors way beyond our control. We aren't the masters of universe. There are things, like climate, that are way beyond our full control. We can affect climate as we did in making this mess. We can't control it as in turning the clock back to make the problem disappear. So the force will be applied. What we get to choose is the area the force is going to hit. spread it wide enough and the construct might take the pressure.

You had 75 years of freedom and development after genocidal war your country caused and centuries before, that war did not deprive Germany of achievements and advantages created in the past, cultural heritage survived, society survived, other side since 18th had 20 years of relative freedom after WWI and now ca 30 years after devastating war and Soviet occupation/communist regime. Country was pulverized, there is very little cultural heritage left, society was crushed and reshaped many times, lost development is irreplaceable.

&gt; 

This is just completely opposite of reality. This problem in particular is best answered by the nations with their troops. The EU has only done harm to the response by screaming about how immigrants are supposed to be treated and hamstrung the countries in their responses. See how EU reacted to Hungary stopping the migrants for instance. This was and continues to be very anti european. Also EU doesn't even have the required weapons to guarantee success at the mission where as the member nations all have enough weapons to guarantee border security.

&gt; How are these nations exactly supposed to stop them?

With their border guard or military.

1. Europeans peeing their pants and giving Erdogan everything he wants, out of fear of either refugees or the anti-refugee crowd.
2. Europeans *actually* putting a bunch of money and manpower into this, letting people cross the border one by one, and processing asylum applications. Those who are actually eligible for asylum or refugee status get sent to countries who are willing and able to accommodate them, the countries who don't want to host them still chip in for the accommodation. The people who aren't eligible for any sort of protected status are sent home. Erdogan loses his most valuable bargaining chip.

Two major fixes:

2. Bosnia and Herzegovina: New -12.3% vs old -8.2%. Old data erroneously counted Sarajevo Canton twice (by adding Sarajevo Canton, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska to get totals for Bosnia and Herzegovina).

2728,"The Guardian is always the best it bashing everything conservative or brexit without any context. Immigration today is not like what it used to be.

I mean all you have to do is look at the people on the Greek and Bulgarian border. Hordes of people who have no interest in anything but the welfare the developed nations provide. The same applies to Eastern Europeans who came to the UK because of the welfare system. 

A lot didn't contribute much to the economy and from several acquaintances of mine I learnt that they usually do jobs off the books and accept cash only to avoid paying tax, etc. There were areas in my borough that essentially became hubs for immigrants who were not contributing back and leeching of the backs of the rest of us. I had Polish neighbours once who came here together as a group of builders, 8 of them, and they lived together in a 3 bedroom house. He practically told us how they usually come here because of the welfare system and the job opportunities. The idea is that they work for a few years, make money and leave but the vast majority of it isn't taxed whilst they gain access to our services. 

I also know a lot of Europeans who like it here and are great contributors to the economy. These good folks are the kind of people we want and that's all. As a final year student, many of my European friends are currently in the process of starting their life here and getting graduate jobs which is exactly what we need.

Our point based system makes sense in today's connected world, it's similar to what Japan has and it works very well in filling the gaps in the job market. It allows us to accept people from any country in the world as long as they will give back to our economy, and we no longer give preferential treatment to a certain group.

What's wrong with this? We aren't being xenophobic or hateful. We just want people that want to come to the UK and become contributing members of our society. We don't have money and resources to just hand out to anyone and we need to look after our citizens first.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/fbp7f9/new_immigration_rules_are_elitist_and_selfish/fj5tdbw/,Virosep,1583042427

2762,"You also can't draw welfare if you're present illegally.  Which dramatically changes the implications of that illegal immigration.

Here's Milton Friedman on illegal immigration from some decade back.  Won a Nobel in economics, was on the team that designed the US income tax system.

* [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eyJIbSgdSE)

* [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfU9Fqah-f4)

&gt; It is one thing to have free immigration to jobs.  It is another thing to have free immigration to welfare.  And you cannot have both.  If you have a welfare state, if you have a state in which every resident is promised a certain minimum level of income or a minimum level of subsistence regardless of whether he works or not, produces it or not...well then it really is an impossible thing, if you have free immigration in the way in which we had it before 1914.

-

&gt; Look for example at the obvious immediate practical case of illegal Mexican immigration.  Now, that Mexican immigration over the border is a good thing!  It's a good thing for the illegal immigrants.  It's a good thing for the United States.  It's a good thing for the citizens of the country.  But it's only good so long as it's illegal.  That's an interesting paradox to think about -- make it legal and it's no good.  Why?  Because as long as it's illegal, the people who come in do not qualify for welfare.  They don't qualify for Social Security.  They don't qualify for all the other myriads of benefits that we pour out from our left pocket into our right pocket.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/fbbzi3/powerful_image_of_an_african_refugee_who_made_the/fj5ui4u/,duisThias,1583043582

But the author is right on one core point: There is no societal agreement on the future course of german politics and the military is where the disagreements are most marked. But that is the result of 30 years of debate avoidance by political Berlin. For four decades military force had no constitutional, societal and moral place in west german thinking outside a potential World War III fought on german soil so combined with the unhappy memories of german history it should not surprise anyone that the notion of ""backing political demands through a credible use of force"" would not go down well.

You should read up on Hellenoturkism. Turks always liked Greeks throughout history, to the point where even Mehmed after he conquered Constantinople made people call himself ""the greek emperor"". There were statesmen as recent as the 1960s and 70s who worked for Turkey and Greece simultaneously in order to create a Greek-Turkish federation. Even in 1999 after the big earthquake Turks saw Greeks as their best ally and best friends who helped to rebuild. We even made a joint bid for Euro 2008 tournament to host it together in Athens and Istanbul.

 Unfortunately from what I've observed is that anti-Turk propaganda from the EU made Greeks hate Turkey again in recent years.

First of all, stop referring to the Syrian branch of [PKK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers%27_Party) (which has been declared a terrorist organization by most of EU including France) as Kurds. There are more than 10 million Kurds living in Turkey, and it is delusional to think that Turkey can get away with an ethnic attack on Syrian Kurds without any repercussions back in Turkey. Kurds in Turkey do not see them as their representative, who are you to present them as such? 

&gt; Also, it allows him to weaponize migrant wave to get money.
&gt; Seems Fair to me. 

It doesn't matter what seems fair to *you*. This is not a high-school debate. 

[EU-Turkey Statement, March 2016](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/03/18/eu-turkey-statement/)

Turkey has agreed to *take any necessary measures to prevent new sea or land routes for irregular migration opening from Turkey to the EU*, and it had been keeping that promise up until now, whereas

EU made the promise to deliver the *second* €3 billion *up to the end of 2018.* and many other promises that they have not fulfilled. 

The premise that Erdogan is making a profit from this money is also ludicrous, as the bill for hosting (currently) ~4 million refugees has reached $40 billion, while the EU hasn't even fully paid €6 billion.
 
&gt; There are still migrants wave, now caused by Turkey and Russian Dicking around in Syria. 

Except, Turkey is currently trying to prevent additional refugees by creating a safe zone in Syria where millions of refugees currently running from Assad can stay, rather than them being forced to create another surge of million(s) refugees to Turkey and Europe.

Cypriot Republic didn't want to unify with Greece, a coup happened. 

Greeks didn't take anything. Republic of Cyprus exists long before the occupation of the north of the island.

Turkey occupies 37% of the island for itself and not for the protection of Turkish Cypriot population (in which they had a legal right to do an intervention as a guarantor state, but only for 3% of the island).

Republic of Cyprus is much better off, because it's a state that follows some liberal economic policies and the tourism thrives. The occupied areas pretty much cant do anything and are dependent on Turkey, because they live under embargoes in everything since the occupation happened.

2927,"&gt; You've been facing ""harsh"" realities in the East since the beginning of times, you should ask yourself a question or two and stop blaming foreign intervention everytime.

I have actually thought about it many times. And this is my conclusion. First of all populations are pretty uniform developed across common territories. The East Europe has its own specific characteristics, the Northern countries as well, the southern ones too, the Center ones are also pretty much at the same level. Then, you can characterize populations by their Slavic descent, or Germanic, or Latin, and each also has its own set of characteristics. We are the sum of these characteristics and the environment we grew up in, to an extent or another. Americans for example developed in their own way and share kind of the same characteristics and mentality across the board.

So, we are the result of past and present environment to a degree or another. It's not like Greeks are lazy and Eastern countries always blame someone else. It is a more complex scenery one should take into consideration. Yes, Germans worked hard after the 2nd world war are rebuild everything to where they are now. But it was inside of them already.

It's also easy to say be self aware, but rather hard when you are born into this.

It's like ""shaming"" Syrians for not being able to have a prosperous and peaceful country. Or some religions for not being able to choose more peaceful Gods. The reality of things is always much more complex and it doesn't always depend on the individual. It's easy to be where you are and point fingers. You haven't lived through communism, you haven't lived through austerity, through shaming, harassment, violence and chaos. Most of my generation and certainly that of my parents did.

Also, as far as capital, we all started at zero 30 years ago.

All I'm asking is to not come on a high horse pointing fingers without having lived our reality and without a good understanding of it. You can, but it will not help you or us.

I am simply describing you reality, it is not blaming, it is not whinning. Just as I told you all our property is now owned by foreign entities. It is the reality of things. So, please do come here and act all self aware when nothing belongs to you. Yes, we were the ones that sold everything, but after communism, when we were eating each other, so we could stay alive this is pretty much all we knew. Thing South Korean type communism to a certain degree, to get a picture.

This was against the narrative, so they copied some more from the 2013 report.  Media didn't bother with the checking and happily reported the worrisome trend.

As for abortions and homosexual rights- currently, these topics were not priorities and my prediction is nothing will be changed in this area in the following 4 years, meaning that abortions will remain legal and homosexual rights such as child adoptions or registered partnership will still be non-existent.

Cute.

&gt; The Iranian drone strike on Abqaiq oil facilities was just the Iranian leadership measuring the American reaction. The Americans didn't care. The Iranians can remain assured that when they do invade Saudi Arabia, the Americans will not arrive to rescue Saudi Arabia.

Unlikely. The cost of war would be too costly for them. This relies on the idea that Iran could be certain that it could conquer Saudi Arabia quickly, which won't be the case. Again, the potential money which is made is too much. But since Iran is sanctions, they could care less, because they aren't profiting of that anyway.

&gt; EU trade is mostly internal yes, but looking at the demographics, and demographics don't lie, things right now is as good as it can get. Like I said before, as the average Europeans become older, they don't consume as much. ...

Let's assume it's true. How has anything of that to do with my original comment? That is what I mean by rambling

&gt; Now, I'm going to cover the importance of a navy. A navy is essential to maintain maritime trade between you and your trading partner. ...

Sure, and being able to protect trade doesn't require a navy the one the US currently has. 

&gt; On the importance of aircraft carriers, they are necessary to project power. If you're going to invade a country, an aircraft carrier is more effective than a destroyer. ...

And how is being able to invade country relevant in that? Your point was that one has to have a good navy to protect trade, then you start acting that aircraft carriers are somehow important for that and when asked your argument is because one can invade countries easier.

&gt; China as it exists today is an aberration. If you know anything at all about Chinese history is that it is constantly marked by internal warfare. For the past millennia, China existed as a unified state for only 3 centuries. Half of that was under Mongol occupation, the Yuan Dynasty you have mentioned, and the remainder? Under the American order.

Wow, man. That's really wrong. This is even wrong if one only considered the time after the mongol conquest and it is especially wrong if one considers the whole history.

Yuan dynasty lasted for about 100 years. Then came Ming for 280 years. Qing lasted for about 280 and 140 years before the US even existed let alone there was something like the American order. How long is that? About 650 years or about 500 years before the US. More than half of a millenia of being unified.

If only talking about the last millenia there was also the song dynasty which for the most part had core China except some northern parts. Before that there was the Sui dynasty, which was completely replaced by the Tang dynasty (290 years).

So yeah. Your statement is wrong on many levels.

Also, it was hardly an occupation if the conquerors pretty much assimilated into China. That's like saying just because many big monarchs in Europe were had German blood or descent that places like Spain, UK were occupied by Germans for the most part.

We europeans **like to have** some kind of a refugee barrier. Take the refugees in and take care of them collectively as EU and then Erdogan has no power over EU. Sure it is going to cost some, but so is going to cost being in dept to Erdogan.

One could see from mile away, that the deal wasn't going to hold and at some point when Erdogansta wanted something, he would open the flood gates. Then call ""give us what I want and I close the gates"". Dealing with guy like him is shooting oneself in the foot. Better just to take care of the core issue ourselves, instead of outsourcing it to a racketeer like Erdogan. and with ourselves and we I mean all of EU. lets say on per capita basis. It is the only way this thing is going to work on long term.

If the Union is  going to crack the over this, well then the Union will crack. It was always going to crack and well it just happened to be this that was the trigger.

3335,"&gt; Only if you also have a unified command structure up to and including the political, and an agreed unified foreign policy. The EU lacks both. And even then it doesn't replace NATO, nor replicate what NATO brings. A federal EU with a single army, as a NATO member would be one thing, an EU army, now as a replacement? Not so much.

I think you take the term ""EU army"" too direct. If the EU gets a EU army, it will be at first basically many EU armies, but simply working under one banner. Basically NATO but more comprehensive.

Yes, a EU army won't replicate what NATO brings, since what NATO brings mainly is the US army.

&gt; No, this argument is, that an EU army would not be functional now, and would not be able to do what NATO does and so would weaken european security.

We are quite secure. As I said before, our only threat is Russia, which in my personal opinion isn't really the case, but most would regard Russia as the only big threat. To suggest that Russia would start directly invading EU territory without NATO, is more than sensationalist and fear mongery.

But otherwise yeah. Having the biggest army not as basically our only protection would weaken our security, but not by much.

&gt; Except it has to work as an armed force, and if it is replacing NATO it has to step into the role of being the primary defensive mechanism for Europe pretty much immediately. It doesn't look like it'd be capable of it any time soon, likely not without massive change within the EU.

True, if one takes my comment literally, I guess.

&gt; NATO is an alliance that does a lot to work toward interoperability, that leans on larger members for specific capabilities. It isn't an Army and doesn't pretend to be. 

Depends. Just because it doesn't call itself one, doesn't mean that it doesn't represent a unified army in some aspects. Last time I checked the EU doesn't call itself a country either, but has many aspects of a country. The world is fluid.

&gt; The US and other NATO members carry out continuous operations and are permanently placed to protect Europe right now. The US could pull out of that, and that would be a massive problem. An EU army wouldn't however solve the problems that a US withdrawal would cause, that's the issue here.. The risk of the US dropping out of NATO is pretty damn small at the moment, while your argument is that the EU members should...

I'm not saying dropping out. I'm saying that the US would simply stop supporting stuff, if they do not agree with something enough. In this case, NATO would be practically paralyzed because most is built upon US support.

Why not? Again, you have a point that for a while the EU army would have to build up, but otherwise there won't be a big problem.

&gt; No, I'm saying that an EU army won't replace NATO. If the EU wants to pull together an army that's up to the EU. I'd again point out that there are potential issues if the EU doesn't do a good job of it, structures it poorly or tries to paper over the issues (Which seems quite likely in context). 

Well true. But that applies to most things if one doesn't do them in a good way.

&gt; I'm saying that if you are creating an EU army, it can't be a fudge and it should become part of NATO. I'm saying that under any circumstances there are massive issues for the EU politically and practically, and so far, under the current way the EU operates, that isn't something I'd want to rely on for defence.

Well, I don't necessarily disagree. I'm not really that big of a supporter of ""simply leaving NATO"".

&gt; No.. It likely won't, but it'll suddenly have a lot more scope to use the same sort of mixed methods to push influence in that direction. It'd weaken Europe massively and reopen the risk of central european states being forced back into a sphere of Russian influence, never mind the issues along the med.

How? The only real type of influence NATO stops are the military ones. Russia will try to influence Europe in their favor regardless of NATO.

I'm not really sure why a EU army would push countries to Russia. Most eastern EU countries want to have a guarantee against Russian aggression (personally I highly doubt there will be any, as Russia's main goal is to stop NATO expansion, but it is what it is). NATO or EU army would do that, since EU has an article similar to NATO's article 5.

&gt; Again, it assumes that the EU would invest. It's just as likely that the EU fails to do so, members like Germany can get rid of unpopular defence spending and make it an EU thing, and then the EU in general can strip defence spending to support things that they'd actually like instead.

Well, my idea would be that there would be a certain percentage which has to be spend on defense in the EU. 

Tbh I highly doubt that such a thing as above would happen. Firstly, because if that was really considered in Germany, Germany would have advocated a EU army since the start. Secondly, the EU budget is voted on. And in general, when the EU does decisions it usually tries to get almost unanimous support, highly doubt that they would simply reduce the budget, which would anger eastern EU much.

&gt; Even that notion (NATO without Turkey..) is a bit of a drama given that Turkey is important in a strategic sense (much like Scotland..) that is often ignored. Without it, defending Europe more generally becomes harder.

Yeah, most have a ""higher than thou"" attitude here in regards to Turkey, as if NATO members is some sort of group of friends who just hang out or something.

&gt; And the issue with an EU army is that the EU isn't ready to actually have one and that in establishing it, it could well undermine NATO, doubly so if it is sold as an alternative. ￼

Well, yes, because as is NATO is basically the US protecting Europe, because it increases their power projection. If Europe/EU could protect itself, of course it would undermine it, because it would make NATO pointless in many ways.

Racism is not a desire to protect your own people in their native country against foreign competition or to want your native people to remain the majority in their ancestral homeland. If that were the case, the Native Americans would have been ""racist"" for opposing the European invasion.

this is the dictionary definition of racism:

1.) a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race

2.) a doctrine or political program based on the assumption of racism and designed to execute its principles

3.) the belief that people's qualities are influenced by their race and that the members of other races are not as good as the members of your own, or the resulting unfair treatment of members of other races:

3475,"The article says, that funding will be hold back for the activities of the Polish Ministry of Justice under the EEA agreement. The recommendation came from The Rafto Foundation, that NGO and partners have worked for a year to support Polish  judges under heavy pressure to conform their judgments to the positions  of the Polish government.

One thing we should make clear. The judicial independence means not only that the judiciary should be independent from the other branches of government representing the separation of powers, but also means that judges must be free to exercise their judicial powers without  interference from other actors, litigants, the media or powerful  individuals or entities, such as large companies or even from NGOs (like Rafto Fundation). 

In the CEE countries, judicial independence from government has been created in extreme high level after 1989 for two reasons. They wanted to prevent the comeback of communist regimes and they wanted to meet the EU criterion. They created unbalanced juridical systems with lack of accountability and check. The judiciaries are extreme independent from the governments but not from other influences. Those systems are anachronistic and almost unchangeable, preventing the states to give quick and decisive responds to the economic, social and other challenges. The juridical reforms has been failed under the coalition governments, only governments with majority could start the reform processes in the CEE states. 

The juridical reform process in Poland, it is a respond to the decades of unbalanced operation of judiciary. The idea is good, *the implementation is bad*. However, no other (better) solution has been seen yet. 

Everyone fears the violation of judicial independence from government in Poland, while nobody has cared about decades of interference by non government actors. If the reform process is against the European law and standards, it should be ruled by the EU court. Not sure about the reactions of other member states and other national judiciaries, when that kind of rule creates precedent in the EU.",,/r/europe/comments/fbbdjq/norway_halts_european_economic_area_funding_for/fj3qz2j/,FDGirl22,1582991121

3558,"&gt;Of course they do, you are blinded by selection bias. In a sense that you are asking the question backwards. Instead of wondering why people from far away hop around once they reach Europe, ask yourself why that isn't the case for local conflicts. That's what I've been hinting at and why I mentioned the Yugoslav Wars, the Albanian Civil War or the War in Ukraine. The countries surrounding those places had to bear the load (and still do in the case of Poland and Belorussia) much like Lebanon has to shoulder the Syrian Civil War.

I still don't get your conclusion about local wars and their difference to wars in the Middle East. If you wish you can try to explain it.

Also keep in mind that in some cases like the Yugoslav wars, the vast majority of the refugees returned to their home countries after the end of the war.

 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Do you realise you are arguing in circles by starting from a faulty presupposition? Asylum ""shopping"", if you want to use such a wanky term, is common on all continents; sure there might be a slightly skewed total for (western) Europe, North America and Australia but its obvious that richer countries are not only more likely to grant requests (and have a robust bureucratic appartus to do so in the first place) but they themselves form more attractive options if given the chance.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is no outlying fenomenon occuring in Europe unless you ardently cherrypick points to fit it your erroneous inital assumption.

Asylum shopping is not my term, it has been used not in a legal capacity, but semi-officially . And I have to disagree with you about it. There are no any significant flows towards any rich Asian countries and the reason is that trafficking networks direct the flows towards Europe.  Another reason is that political conflicts, like now with Turkey, also have the same result.

Richer countries are not that likely to accept requests as you make it sound, surely not  indefinitely.

In 2015 Germany accepted more than 1 million migrants. In 2016 after Austria's request or lets say encouragement (I personally believe that Germany was behind that evolvement) the Balkan route close.

Today 50% of the migrants in Germany are still unemployed and live on benefits and the vast majority of failed asylum seekers has not yet been deported. Imagine how these stats would look if the Balkan route had never closed and Germany kept accepting every year migrants at the same rate as in 2015. The situation would probably had been derailed by now.

Furthermore, there is also political cost and destabilization. The 2015 influx of migrants was followed by a sharp rise of far-right parties ""all-over"" Europe. Political cost is something additional that governments and political parties have to handle along any other adverse effects of immigration.

Finally, ending up to a richer country [as I described in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/fawet0/greek_pm_says_no_illegal_entries_into_greece_will/fj3baty/), does not necessarily mean that this is the best outcome for the migrants. They are exploited in ""good"" countries too, sometimes in inhuman ways.

(Germany for Germans, foreigners out!) and her supporters would start talking about the evil of muslim immigrants and you would ask yourself: Wait, this isn't an anti FFF demonstration, these guys are just right wing extremist who are looking for another excuse to spread their neo fascist ideology. And guess what? You would be right.

FFF has not mixed up stuff as much as this right wing puppet right there. You can go to an FFF demonstration and people would talk only about climate change and how we are all fucked if nothing is going to happen. Nobody would start talking about LGBT-Rights, abortions or feminism. I know that right wing Fake News will write about how Greta Thunberg is against white people, for islam and communism without having any source or proof that she said any of this. They just come up with things that their readers hate and project it on a disabled Swedish girl.

There is also another thing that bothers me: Greta and FFF are constantly talking about studies and facts while this anti-Greta piece of shit only talks about ideology and has literally zero facts to offer, except for faked studies (and by that I mean studies that have been proven to be faked in order to suit the world views of big coal and big oil and gas companies).

3683,"&gt;You do realise those number are a drop in the bucket? If you take the total number of refugees in the EU, some 5.5 million, that is still less than merely Turkey and Lebanon combined.

The numbers shouldn't be examined out of context. Direct comparisons don't tell much. Take into account Greece's high unemployment rate, economic status and total population to make the comparison more fair.

 

&gt;You answered yourself in the previous paragraph. Greece can't handle the amount of people it gets due to economic reasons. The further east you go, the more this problem is exacerbated. Even with it's economy in shambles and Italy's shaking one, they are still far more preferable alternatives to the likes of Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazachstan, or Thailand (and disregarding the sheer distance to the Pacific here for the sake of argument).  
&gt;  
&gt;Not to mention other critical issues, like the political and social situation. Azerbaijan was in a state of near-war for what is now more than a decade, Lebanon went through a devastating civil war, Israeli invasion and sectarian violence in the last 3 decades with little respite. Iran took in millions of Iraqis, Afghani, and Pakistanis.

First of all, we should examine where these refugees end up. Ending up in ghettos like the French banlieues for example, practically means that they don't live any better than staying in Serbia or Bulgaria or other Balkan countries.

The gain for reaching rich countries for many migrants is only theoretical. If the end up belonging to the 10th lower percentile of  general population regarding quality of life, then they actually become vulnerable and don't have any benefits compared with living as an average citizen in a poorer country.

Here's another example. African women have been forcefully prostituted by Nigerian mafia members (who shouldn't be in Europe anyway, it's unacceptable for mafia members not to have immediately been deported) and possibly other mafias in Italy and other EU countries. Wouldn't it be better for them to stay in the Balkans far from the reach of those mafias or is it better to stay in a wealthier country and getting repeatedly abused?

As for Asian countries there are way more in Asia than those you mentioned... How many refugees has Israel received which is by the way a neighbor to Syria? How many has China? Or South Korea?

You shouldn't only mention countries near Syria. [Bangladeshi people](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/07/bangladeshi-migrants-board-boats-libya-reach-europe-190711070559458.html) travel half the world and get smuggled from country to country in order to reach Libya and cross to the EU. Probably there are easier alternatives than this endless trip.

The fact that signatories don't distribute the refugees among them is beyond unacceptable. What's happening now is that refugees (and also people who don't fulfill the requirements to get refugee status) move from country to country by using traffickers.

A refugee system that's based on trafficking is from the beginning failed. The distribution of refugees should happen officially among the signatories and their transportation should be assisted by them.

My last point is that it is illogical to cross through a country that is a signatory and not apply for asylum. That makes the stay illegal and risking deportation while being in severe danger does not make any sense.",,/r/europe/comments/fawet0/greek_pm_says_no_illegal_entries_into_greece_will/fj3baty/,TravellingAroundMan,1582976837

3784,"You’re making this very personal and I’m not inclined to participate in such thing.  Going ad absurdum is not the way to rationally discuss things either. 

No I’m not stating any of absurds you mention. Not all Germans and not always so here.  

Now would you admit that since at 18th century and times leading to the Partitions German Prussia was working tirelessly on destruction of Polish state and nation? This policy continued for next century, then after 1870 became all German policy? Will you acknowledge this:

&gt; German academics between the 18th and 20th centuries attempted to project, in the difference between Germany and Poland, a ""boundary between civilization and barbarism; high German Kultur and primitive Slavdom"" (1793 racist diatribe by J.C. Schulz republished by the Nazis in 1941).[35] Prussian officials, eager to secure Polish partition, encouraged the view that the Poles were culturally inferior and in need of Prussian tutelage.[33] Such racist texts, originally published from the 18th century onwards, were republished by the German Reich prior to and after its invasion of Poland.
&gt;Frederick the Great of Prussia nourished a particular hatred and contempt for the Polish people. Following his conquest of Poland, he compared the Poles to ""Iroquois"" of Canada.[33] In his all-encompassing anti-Polish campaign, even the nobility of Polish background living in Prussia were obliged to pay higher taxes than those of German heritage. Polish monasteries were viewed as ""lairs of idleness"" and their property often seized by Prussian authorities. The prevalent Catholicism among Poles was stigmatised. The Polish language was persecuted at all levels.[36]

...

&gt; In the politics of inter-war Germany, anti-Polish feelings ran high.[60] The American historian Gerhard Weinberg observed that for many Germans in the Weimar Republic, ""Poland was an abomination"", Poles were ""an East European species of cockroach"", Poland was usually described as a Saisonstaat (a state for a season), and Germans used the phrase ""Polish economy"" (polnische Wirtschaft) for a situation of hopeless muddle.[60] Weinberg noted that in the 1920s–30s, leading German politicians refused to accept Poland as a legitimate nation, and hoped instead to partition Poland, probably with the help of the Soviet Union.[60]
&gt;The British historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote in 1945 that National Socialism was inevitable because the Germans wanted ""to repudiate the equality with the peoples of (central and) eastern Europe which had then been forced upon them"" after 1918.[61] Taylor wrote that:
""During the preceding eighty years the Germans had sacrificed to the Reich all their liberties; they demanded as a reward the enslavement of others. No German recognized the Czechs or Poles as equals. Therefore, every German desired the achievement which only total war could give. By no other means could the Reich be held together. It had been made by conquest and for conquest; if it ever gave up its career of conquest, it would dissolve.""[62]",CE,/r/europe/comments/f5j9ee/macron_broke_the_nuclear_taboo_poland_rebuffs/fj36vyn/,wontek,1582970360

3812,"From [here](https://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/roma/gft/gft056.htm) :

&gt; In a letter of 8th February 1898, Mr. William Larminie, of Bray, Co. Wicklow, the author of West Irish Folk-tales (1893), writes:--'I have never heard of Irish Gypsies proper. They seem never to have settled in the country for some reason.' On the other hand, three or four English-Gypsy families of my acquaintance have certainly travelled Ireland during the last thirty years; Simson's History of the Gipsies (1865) contains allusions on pp. 325-8, 356-8, etc., to visits of 'Irish Gipsies' to Scotland; and, according to a note by Mr. Ffrench of Donegal in the Gypsy Lore Journal for April 1890, p. 127, 'there are two tribes of Gypsy-folk in Ireland.

You should check your numbers...

The total number of displaced people in the world is about [70 million, of whom about 30 million are internationally displaced. (""refugees"").](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-48682783) Turkey houses about 4 million. 4/70*100% = 6%, or 4/30*100% = 13%. A lot, sure, but not 64% of the world's refugees. Lebanon and Jordan are far worse off (in terms of refugees to population), and have been for a lot longer than Turkey. Yet they don't get nearly as much support.

I am not sure where your $800 billion comes from, as Erdogan himself says [it is only $37 billion, with Europe chipping in about €2.5 billion.](https://www.tccb.gov.tr/en/news/542/107006/-we-should-boost-our-economic-cooperation-as-the-balkan-countries-in-order-to-increase-our-competitive-strength-)

Turkey itself agreed to the refugee deal which [includes far more than just money.](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-towards-a-new-policy-on-migration/file-eu-turkey-statement-action-plan) If you could kindly point which points are not fullfilled while they should have be, I'd be much oblidged.

&gt;Also, Erdogan ""adventured"" into Syria to rehouse the migrants Europe wouldn't help.

You don't actually believe that, right? The middle east is a mess of a power struggle between, mostly Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia with the US and Russia tipping in. The 'rehousing refugees' was just a nice bit of propaganda to try and convince Europe to support him.

&gt;And let's not forget that the Syrian civil war was started by American and European support for the Arab Spring. It wasn't Erdogan who destablized the Middle East.

Oh and btw,if Iran managed to get a hold of Iraqi oil fields,with their own oil fields,then your economy goes to shit if they decide to not sell you the oil.

4046,"&gt; Also we can threaten to sanction them if they won't take them back.

Turkey will just release more refugees. They have porous borders with not just Syria but Iraq (conduit for Afghans and Pakistans) too. 

Pakistan is a nuclear state. They have often used their nuclear bombs as blackmail to get what they wish (if our country collapses, there is a high chance terrorists with anti-Western views get ""dirty"" nuclear bombs in a backpack to explode in major western cities). Afghanistan's budget is something like 1/3rd funded by Western foreign aid. If their country collapses even more, more refugees will come. 

Even beyond moral issues, you are not thinking about economics. Do you know how expensive it is to find people and then coral them, put them through the legal system and finally deport them? The plane ticket itself is very costly. There are often multiple instances of appeal. 

Just today, a US court struck down a Trump rule to prevent central Americans. In a democracy, the ruling party/coalition is not the final arbiter. The judiciary gets the final say and they stick to the constitution, which is often very liberal by design. Something Trump is now realising.

The USA was greatly influenced by folks fleeing the power of the state, many facing persecution and exclusion as the Romany did/are. Because of this, there is a lot of legislation on the state and federal level that protects life styles like this. There is also far less taboo for living on communes, otherwise isolated communities, or pursuing a nomadic lifestyle. Some forms of it are even revered as a way out of the late capitalist grind. We also have a lot of non inhabited land, so it's easier to duck out of society and start your own collective without there being tension between your group and others. This, of course gets a little murky when it comes to Native Americans, but that has a lot to do with with the fact that they are the colonized group rather than the oppressors, which garnered them less privilege.

Something else I've been mulling over is how guns effect this. It's pretty common for  folks to have guns, especially in the boonies. A friend invited me to a pagan ceremony out in the middle of nowhere in a state much more red than mine (see: firearms) and I met these folks who were talking about starting a planned community. They were pretty into guns. If I hadn't gone with someone I trust, I would've been pretty scared. I'd imagine that kind of thing would keep folks from messing with them, and, if they're truly isolationist, they wouldn't mess with other people.

Correct. I don't owe you anything, but that doesn't mean I can just kick in you door and start sending people into your living room. Doing that *is* a hostile action.

I'm not talking about strongarming. I'm talking about reacting to a hostile action. I like to again stress out, that if Tehran had been using Afghan refugees in a similar manner, Turks would be absolutely pissed. The EU doesn't automatically have a responsibility to save the whole world and risk our own stability just because we've managed to build up a functional society.

*&gt; Turkey has millions of what Europe fears the most. Europe won't sanction Turkey for that reason, and Erdogan knows this.* 

Duh. That's whole point. We should put ourselves in a position where authoritarians can't threaten us and react in kind when they do. This involves automatically rejecting anyone's refugee status if they come from a safe country and making deals with other countries to ship them to if they refuse to go home. Putin also vetoed us in the UN so we couldn't ship them directly back to Libya if we found them just outside their waters. We need to treat that veto as Russia treats the UN resolutions against itself.

*&gt;  That's what happens when you bribe a country to become your refugee dump.*

On top of that any gypsy going to highschool or university gets extra points and benefits on enterance exams,regardless of them being from a good standing family or piss poor one, while everyone else fears not being accepted for 0,1 points.

They also get certain amount of money for every child, which is enough that they decide to make 3+ kids and live off of it as well as family with 2 employed adults.

In the Middle Ages right up through the early modern era governments didn't really have any authority outside of towns and country estates, so you could pretty much live however you liked.

As the scale and power of the state expanded the possibility of living outside of it withered away. The change in the way economies worked probably took away a lot of the traditional livelihood of trading, too.

4214,"&gt;Dream on. Turkish-Syrian border is too long to have effective border control

Irrelevant. The footage was clear enough to show activity near actual border, not a desert.

&gt;Sure, let's forget that Assad started this and the role of US, France, Russia, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iran etc.

No one said Assad didn't cause it, he did, by being a reckless powerhungry idiot just like Erdogan was and due to which he put his soldiers at risk like this. This whataboutism won't bring us anywhere in this argument. If it hadn't been for the Arab-Turkish support for insurgents, rebels and jihadists, hundreds of thousands wouldn't have died and millions wouldn't have left Syria probably for good. 

&gt;This is Russian propaganda for downing their jet. 

When you have neutral relationship with a country, as Russia, you're not going to blackmail the country unless the relationship is shattered already. That's when you blackmail. And that's what Russia did. 'Propaganda'? Lmfao. Probably Arma 3 footage, right? It's a clear video footage. 

&gt;Yeah I can see it already happen. Al those people tortured by Assad happy to go back. /s

Laws are laws, rules are rules, refugee should be returned back to a stabilized country. Definitely there will be families that are recorded as being anti-Assad, but you won't see Assad put 3,5 million people into jail. There were huge numbers of repatriation and amnesties. There were arrests of highranking rebels though. It's not 3,5 million rebels that fled, many fled because they were besieged by two or even three to four sides at the same time. Pretty sure many are homesick.

&gt;Let's forget that Assad butchered more people than ISIS could ever dream of. Let's forget Hezbollah. Normal Syrians at mercy of these terrorists.

You're talking about Assad like he's a Hitler that hates his people. You're forgetting that people that were butchered were rebels, jihadists, insurgents and whatnot. Your whataboutism is prevalent once again, even downplaying attrocities of ISIS. I am beginning to doubt your objectivity here.

Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think Turkey's purpose in Idlib is to fight PKK terrorists. They wanted to create a buffer zone against the advancing Syrian army to keep Syrians in the region from fleeing. It seems they have underestimated the boldness of Assad's forces and the people have fled regardless.

If Turkey hadn't entered Syria, it would still be facing ~1 million refugees fleeing the advancing Syrian forces.

The idea of those 6 specific counties having any sort of  separation from the rest of Ireland or even as a grouping of counties was invented to get the largest patch of land possible in Ireland that would have a majority Protestant population (with your religion being fairly accurately used to define whether you were nationalist or unionist).

You'd honestly say it was reasonable enough if there was a majority Protestant population in the province of Ulster and that whole province stayed in the union, but instead they Gerrymandered 6 out of 9 counties. 2 of which were actually majority Catholic.

&gt;  
&gt;We first need to build so much renewable energy that there actually *is* an excess that can be converted.

So, in essence, storage is not an issue because Germany's plan is too slow and unambitious for it to be necessary in the following decades?

How long until German grid carbon density reaches France's level? And at what cost?

Reminder that the energy transition is a race against time, the goal being to reach sustainable levels of CO2 emissions *as fast as possible*. The longer you take to reach that level, the more CO2 you'll have pumped into the atmosphere and the greater the impact on the climate.

&gt;[The majority of new heating systems installed in Germany use natural gas. Last year, a natural gas boiler was installed in almost one in two newly built homes (49.8%), and a heat pump in around one in five homes (19.9%). The percentage of new homes that use a district heating system is even a little higher (21.5 per cent); around 6 per cent of homes use wood and wood pellets as their primary source of heat. The share of oil-fired boilers installed in new homes has become negligible, reaching only 0.7 per cent in 2014. Ten years ago, the situation was completely different.](https://www.bmwi-energiewende.de/EWD/Redaktion/EN/Newsletter/2015/09/Meldung/infografik-heizsysteme.html)

That's for new homes, though? Or am I reading this wrong?

&gt;We're not going to swap to carbonless sources overnight. We will continue to use some fossil fuels for the time being, and if any, let that be gas, the least harmful

Maybe you should apply that reasoning to electricity generation in the first place, insteal of building new coal mines and plants.

It's kinda weird seeing you use electricity taking a long time to decarbonize as an argument to defend gas use, while at the same time paying no mind to NPPs being shut down *which slows down grid decarbonization even more…*

&gt;because it enables renewables (or nuclear for that matter), and it will be used less and less the more and more renewables we have (unlike nuclear),

Gas infrastructure for heating enables renewables and nuclear? How? The only renewable source it enables is biogas, which only accounts for a ridiculous share of gas supply.

4620,"&gt;France still uses fuels, I don't see them reducing their fuel use, or switching to something nuclear-based. While their emissions are low, they are stagnating and they're not making substantial progress. They'r reducing their reliance on nuclear too, anyway.

This is a real weird argument all around.

1. France still using fuels for heating doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.
2. Same thing for our governments wanting to reduce reliance on nuclear. (Which is nowhere near as radical as your government's approach on the matter, BTW).
3. The part about emissions from France ""stagnating"" and ""not making substantial progress"", implying Germany has the better transition solution, is downright bizarre. It's like an obese person bragging about having a better diet than a somewhat fit one because he's losing weight faster. It gets even weirder when you look at the actual decrease in Germany's yearly CO2 emissions per capita over the course of the energiewende. [From 9.92 tons per capita in 2013 to 9.15 tons per capita in 2018.](https://knoema.com/atlas/Germany/CO2-emissions-per-capita) Better than nothing, but even if we extrapolate from that data to predict future progression (using a linear regression, which is a very optimistic scenario), you still won't be beating a stagnating France (DE: 6.2 tons per capita vs FR: \~5 tons per capita) and will have emitted a lot more CO2 during the transition period.

&gt;Gambling everything on nuclear ignores the numerous uncertainties and observed impossibility to build a nuclear plant on time and within budget, and locks us into that gamble for half a century.

""Observed impossibility to build a nuclear plant on time and within budget"" is downright false. The first French nuclear plants took around 6 years to build. The new EPR design, made to be even safer than previous PWRs, is the one that tends to get over budget and seems to take 10-15 years to build for the first models ([Taishan's 2 reactors took 9 years to build](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taishan_Nuclear_Power_Plant)). But it's not the sole reactor design currently available, regular PWRs and CANDUS are other examples. Small Modular Reactors (SMR) are also being developed to take advantage of economy of scale and serial production.

In any case, I find the criticism of the cost and construction time of the newest reactor designs a bit odd, considering Germany's energy transition 1) requires massive subsidies and infrastructure work, and 2) appears to take a *very long time* before reaching acceptable grid decarbonization. Germany apparently doesn't deem it necessary to close its *coal power plants* before *2038.* By that point, even EPRs that start construction now would be supplying power, even if we assume they go through all the possible fuckups we've observed so far.

I'd rather pay a bit more and be guaranteed low-carbon electricity in less than 2 decades than pay about as much and be certain that goal won't be achieved in that time span, or even achieved at all.

&gt;Fossil fuels with the necessary climate cost included are not competitive. But they're also a worse fit because they rely on concentrated deposits, allowing some countries to have an oligopoly. That's not good for the market. And there there obviously are the enduring fossil fuel subsidies all around the world too - there is no energy source without subsidies, and while renewables at least have some projects without subsidies, there is not a single nuclear project without state support.

And? Who cares whether every single renewable plant requires subsidies when any and all large scale renewable makeover requires subsidies, advantages like grid priority, not to mention massive infrastructure changes. You think connecting offshore wind power from the northern coast to your industrial hubs in the south would go well without any public investments in infrastructure changes?

&gt;But the sun shines for everyone, and it's not like someone can cut the sun off.

The Russians can certainly cut off your gas though. So relying primarily on it for heat generation isn't the best idea.

&gt;They have plenty of hydro, that's easy mode, whatever else you add to it. I'm pretty sure they don't use their NPP as backup sources - they're simply prohibitively expensive that way.

That's not what I meant by ""backstop"", I meant they use NPPs for baseload and keep using them for as long as they're functional and necessary for a low-carbon grid.

&gt;And it worked: Germany's commitment was one of the factors that finally drew enough confidence and therefore investment into renewables, allowing the economies of scale that have precipitated the continuously falling prices of renewable energy.

That's not a ""solid plan"". A solid plan would involve having a good idea of how to achieve a low-carbon society in a reasonable timespan. Making low-carbon power sources affordable is only a small part of that.

4635,"&gt;No, I'm estimating *investment cost*. That's why they use kWh: it doesn't matter what the nameplate capacity of the installations is, just how much kWh they delivered over time.

[You said:](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/f67sv5/two_weeks_of_wind_power_production_in_germany/filb9af/)

&gt;This shows that a kWh from wind only costs 45% of a kWh from nuclear, in the worst case scenario, taking the cheapest numbers from nuclear and the most expensive wind. So you can build 222% of **capacity** for the same money.

&gt;~~Ok, but that's not for tonight.~~ edit: skimming the table of contents. It has headers for:  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;It does *not* seem to account for initial investment costs, which is the bulk of the cost.

You shouldn't have simply skimmed the table of contents. You should've at least read the conclusion which I gave you the location of (p161):

&gt;Cette méthode du CCE repose sur une approche « théorique » qui conduit à calculer a posteriori un loyer économique annuel constant depuis la mise en service des centrales et qui permettrait de reconstituer, à la fin de leur durée de fonctionnement, un parc identique au parc initial. Cette méthode définit ainsi un coût global moyen sur toute la durée de fonctionnement du parc, utile pour comparer le prix des énergies entre elles.

Which translates to:

&gt;This method is based on a ""theoretical"" approach, which consists in calculating after the fact a constant yearly rent, starting from the moment the plants have started supplying power, and **which would account for rebuilding a new, identical reactor fleet once the current fleet expires. This method thus defines a global cost**, averaged over the entire duration of the fleet, which is useful for comparing the costs of various energy sources.

You can see in the tables throughout the report that the ""loyer économique"" is a specific item, separate from running costs (dépenses d’exploitation), maintenance costs (investissements sur le parc existant), future costs/provisions (provision pour gestion des déchets et du combustible usé, provision pour démantèlement)... There's even a section which discusses how prolonging NPP service from 40 to 50 years impacts this ""rent"":

&gt;Le niveau du loyer économique : a priori, ce dernier ne devrait pas évoluer si la durée d’exploitation des réacteurs est limitée à 40 ans. Mais comme on l’a vu précédemment (chapitre II), dans cette hypothèse, le niveau des investissements de maintenance serait sensiblement réduit par rapport aux projections actuelles du projet industriel d’EDF ; parallèlement, on peut imaginer que la production du parc serait réduite soit du fait de pannes plus nombreuses, soit même par l’arrêt de réacteurs avant leur 40ème année, les investissements nécessaires pour les maintenir en état de marche n’étant pas rentables pour une durée d’utilisation courte.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dans le cas d’une durée d’utilisation prolongée à 50 ans, deux méthodes de calcul du loyer économique peuvent être envisagées :  
&gt;  
&gt;o soit lisser l’effet de la prolongation sur l’intégralité des 50 années de production des réacteurs avec un loyer recalculé sur 50 ans depuis l’origine (méthode retenue par la Cour des comptes) : cette méthode a un faible impact sur le niveau du loyer, comme l’avait déjà souligné le rapport de 2012, mais est cohérente avec la logique du calcul du CCE ;  
&gt;  
&gt;o soit reporter tout l’impact positif de la prolongation d’exploitation sur les années d’exploitation restantes à partir de la date de prise de la décision165, par exemple 2014 (méthode retenue par EDF) : cette méthode diminue le montant du loyer pour les années à venir ; elle rompt avec la logique et la définition du calcul du CCE et s’éloigne du calcul du coût global de production du parc. If you want further detail on what the ""loyer économique"" consists in, you can look in the appendix, p211: Dans cette approche, on cherche à mesurer le coût annuel de rémunération et de remboursement du capital permettant, à la fin de vie du parc, de reconstituer en monnaie constante le montant de l' investissement initial (c'est-à-dire le montant qui permettrait de reconstruire, à la fin de vie du parc, un parc identique au parc historique). Pour faire ce calcul, EDF retient la méthode du coût courant économique qui permet la prise en compte du coût du capital dans le calcul du coût moyen de la production d'électricité nucléaire en la combinant avec le modèle financier, dit ""modèle d'évaluation des actifs financiers"" (MEDAF), d'usage courant chez les industriels, qui fournit une estimation du taux de rendement attendu par le marché pour un actif financier en fonction de son risque systémique. Le coût de rémunération et de reconstitution du capital investi y est mesuré à travers un loyer économique à échéances annuelles constantes sur toute la durée de fonctionnement du parc. Ce loyer est calculé de façon à permettre à un investisseur d’être remboursé et rémunéré de son investissement à la hauteur de sa valeur réévaluée à la fin de sa durée de vie. En d’autres termes, le loyer économique, constant en euros constants, reflète le prix qu’un fournisseur serait disposé à payer s’il avait à louer le parc nucléaire plutôt qu’à le construire.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cette approche ne tient pas compte des conditions historiques de financement de la construction du parc et cherche à donner une idée de ce que coûterait aujourd’hui sa reconstruction à technologie constante. Elle permet de calculer le coût global moyen, pour l’exploitant, de production du parc nucléaire sur toute sa durée de vie.

TLDR: This report absolutely *does* account for initial investement costs. That's the entire point. I've given you the page of the conclusion section of the report, why didn't you read it?

As for this claim:

&gt;Nor does it evaluate whether there are items in the military budget that ended up subsidizing the enterpirse, in particular relating to the nuclear missile capacity.

You're the one who claims that such items exist. Is the Cour des Comptes lying? Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence: You should provide proof that such unaccounted for costs exist, of their amount, and then detail whether they are:

* R&amp;D costs, which don't apply to subsequent uses of the resulting technology Or
* Construction costs, which remain part of the initial investment whenever a new project is planned

&gt;And that's assuming it's possible to average out the cost of large accidents, which it isn't.

Not sure what this is even supposed to mean. You can calcullate the average externalities (in lives and material) of dam failures, oil spills, CO2 emissions, coal fumes, mining accidents, renewable construction accidents. Nuclear power isn't any different in that regard.

&gt;That would be acceptable. But the problem is that the state support also covers risks like meltdown risks, and by necessity, risks of mishaps with waste storage. Insurance for that on the private market would triple the price.

See above. Every energy source has negative externalities and accident risks. Why would insurance for dam failure ([which once caused 171,000 fatalities *in the deadliest power-plant-caused catastrophe ever*, and which has frequently led to hundreds to thousands of deaths per accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam_failure#List_of_major_dam_failures), not to mention habitat and arable land loss) be a non-issue but similar insurance for nuclear accidents be a no-go? This makes no sense.",,/r/europe/comments/f67sv5/two_weeks_of_wind_power_production_in_germany/fj0o3b9/,Perett2822120,1582904260
4636,"&gt;Another reason is that renewables are making such advances that the private market expects that nuclear plants will be obsolete, and they don't like their capital getting stranded in an unprofitable investment.

...Or maybe they simply want to make bank on renewable-specific state-subsidized advantages while they're hot, and expect to make a quick return on their investment before they end. After all, the expected lifespan of renewable sources built today, which subsidies are designed to make profitable, is of about 20 years, which means the vast majority will have made a return before 2040, when countries will need to get serious to meet their 2050 goal (or will simply quit).

Besides, investing in renewables in countries with advantages such as grid priority, low intermittent generation, and a high dispatchable capacity is a safe bet: Renewable producers are guaranteed to sell whatever energy they produce as long as there are enough dispatchable sources to exercize right of way over. Even countries where peak intermittent delivery sometimes exceed consumption pay be fine if renewable ""production losses"" are compensated for.

But such an advantageous situation can only last until a certain point; Increasing renewable capacity yields diminishing returns in terms of CO2 reduction once production regularly exceeds consumption, grid priority won't guarantee sales, and loss compensation will become a higher and higher share of electricity bills if it doesn't get straight up dropped. This will make investments in renewables less and less appealing.

Reminder that without subsidies, investors would (and *did*) invest in cheap fossil fuel sources instead. They don't look at what the cost of going 90+% renewable would be for the public in 20 years, they look at how much they can make based on the economic situation and policies in place *right now*. The private market's decisions are the reason we're in this mess in the first place, and you're using their stance as an indicator of sustainability?

*Engineers and researchers* are the ones who plan out decades-spanning climate transition plans, not bankers who expect a ROI in &lt;20 years or politicians who seek short-term elections. And so far, I haven't seen any study that gives us a nuclear-less &lt;80gCO2eq/kWh grid without the use of currently non-existent technology. From a technical standpoint, nothing seems to indicate that nuclear power, as an indispensible source of power for low-carbon electricity grids, will become obsolete anytime soon.

&gt;Obviously renewable energy needs support to catch up with the suport other energy sources have been getting over the years, to get to a level playing field.

A ""level-playing field""? What are you talking about? The goal here is to transition towards a low-carbon grid for as little as possible, right? To minimise Cost\*CO2/person? Then a low-carbon electricity source fitting in nicely within our current centralized network and needing little to no further R&amp;D to be viable as a major power source *is an advantage, which needs to be taken into account when comparing it to alternatives.*

Research and infrastructure costs necessary for renewable integration are part of your transition strategy's costs, you can't just ignore them. Nor can you ignore the lost revenue caused by shutting down functional NPPs prematurely.

&gt;You mean fixed tariffs, like the Hinkley Point NPP is getting? But Hinkley Point is getting tariffs that are substantially higher than the price of wind energy... [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/10/uk-windfarms-become-cheaper-than-hinkley-point-c](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/10/uk-windfarms-become-cheaper-than-hinkley-point-c)

This is a typical, incomplete comparison between the two prices, where the negative externalities of wind as an hypothetical main electricity source aren't taken into account. This sums it up:

&gt;The nuclear industry argues that no single low carbon source could meet the UK’s power needs alone.  
&gt;  
&gt;“With two-thirds of the UK’s currently dispatchable generation capacity due to retire by 2030, including all but one of the current nuclear fleet, the UK will need the full range of low carbon technologies to provide the reliable, secure and readily available power for homes, businesses and public services,” said Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association.

Again, as long as intermittent production doesn't exceed production and dispatchable power is largely available, the advertized cost of intermittent renewables isn't something you can simply extrapolate when planning an actual low-carbon grid long term.

&gt;The link I gave earlier has an outline of the needed steps on a timeline. And a lot of links that I didn't all follow either.

What link? What part of it? You'll have to be a little more precise, I took the time to give you the location of relevant information when sharing sources, you should probably do the same.

&gt;The current fraction of renewable energy on the German grid is already higher than expected, so it seems to be working out fine.

33% is higher than expected? How do you expect to get to into &lt;100gCO2/kWh territory in a reasonable timeframe with such an unambitious plan? Not to mention the definitive shutdown of your remaining NPPs will set you back years in terms of carbon footprint reduction (that's \~70TWh/year of low-carbon energy you'll need to compensate for one way or another. Renewable source construction in Germany generates an additional yearly 15TWh *at best*). Then again, if Germany was really concerned about the urgency of climate change they would *at least* build new gas power plants instead of shiny new coal power plants *which emit twice as much*. Go figure.

As for ""working out fine"", check out OP's pic. How much more installed renewable capacity can your grid handle before peak intermittent production overtakes consumption? Looks to me like you're a 50% increase away from having to shut down renewable capacity during peaks.

Your grid is ""working out fine"" because of an abundance of dispatchable energy sources. It has very little to do with currently available storage capacity, which you'll need a *lot* more of if you want to reach acceptable grid carbon levels through renewables alone.",,/r/europe/comments/f67sv5/two_weeks_of_wind_power_production_in_germany/fj0o49e/,Perett2822120,1582904276

A dodgy liver and MDMA is way more likely to produce a bad reaction than with alcohol. A quick Google of, ""mdma liver failure"", makes for an interesting read.

For the record, I think MDMA is a great drug with a wealth of both recreational and therapeutic benefits, but a person's first dose should always be cautious. It's also a really bad idea to be consuming alcohol with MDMA, and unfortunately in the UK that seems to have become the norm.

MDMA is a pretty safe drug all things considered, for those who don't have a condition that may react badly.

4667,"TL;DR - you will not stop people that work abroad from going back home. Example: currently working with Hungarian Colleague in a project in LATAM. We will all use the same to go back home. Flights from China and other 30+ countries go through there. How long till a person like him gets infected by no fault of his own and goes back home?

**Opinion:** Closing borders, for whatever reason, is a placebo to appease the masses and allow a path to place responsibility for the failure of public policies to the “other.” 

—————-

I have one Hungarian colleague in this project we are working at in Latin America. There are no cases in this country in specific. And the healthcare system is quite good; I feel confident they will eventually catch infected people coming in and preventing from continuing forward  because they have become better and better at testing temperature watching for signs and quarantining potentially infected (so far all negative).

**But here is the thing:** there are direct flights from China and to China, Spain, Portugal, France, Turkey, Germany, and like 30 other countries....from here. 

We all use this airport. How long till someone sick unknowingly touches the same surface? (The virus survives close to 9 days) How long till someone gets to his flight because he had zero symptoms at the time of boarding? 

How long till someone working abroad goes back home, infected and without symptoms yet? 

*This is the nature of the world we live in. You will not stop business travelers, diplomats, expats, freelancers like, humanitarian workers... because that is what we do to eat, pay taxes, social security, contribute to our economies. And have a life. And sometimes we even do it because the world needs us to do it, and trust me you want us there. We are so interconectad that closing borders is just a placebo to placate masses and blame the problems on the foreign instead of admitting we need systemic (and expensive) changes if we want better democracies. *",,/r/europe/comments/f9rkw8/corona_virus_megathread/fj0okgy/,yago1980,1582904540

The problem is that no European country wants to get itself involved in the post-conflict political settlements in the Middle East.

It just seems that no matter what we do, our interventions simply do not work in the post-crisis stage.

So it looks like that with an intervention, you are basically setting yourself up to stay indefinitely, being solely responsible for enforcing the status quo and the moment you leave everything falls apart again.

1. Water diffusion inside the pasta, from the surface to the core. It happens even when the water is cold.
2. Starch gelatinization, in which starch grains absorb water and dilate. It starts at 60°C.
3. Gluten denaturation and aggregation. It starts once the water has reached a temperature between 70°C and 80°C.

To properly cook pasta these three phenomena should occur simultaneously and the whole cooking process should last for as long as, but not longer than, the pasta maker suggests.  
I suppose you might believe that putting pasta in cold water is the same as cooking it in boiling water, because you have always overcooked it resulting in something we call ""pasta scotta"", a crime for which in Italy you might lose your citizenship.",,/r/europe/comments/fatrnj/are_you_german_heavy_accusations_from_an_italian/fj0de66/,Kelioh,1582897140

We're left in this weird place where there's simply no room left for structural reform to be implemented, simply because we don't have the resources to make it possible.

I issue is that Western Europe mostly makes our climate and tax rates work in its favor and fight to keep them at the same levels, but on the other hand we're asked to invest more in structural development. Well, how ? Can someone explain how this may be possible ?

In others, the UK might reach the floor, but France or Malta might exceed them, thus being superior to Britain in that area.  The EU says its wants a fair competition between them, so I suggest that the EU raise their standards to reach the UK's, and then in future allow both Unions to build new regulations as needed independently of each other.  I'd probably be fine with setting the current standards at what the EU currently has and allow them a small competitive advantage as I believe the main reason the UK would have set tougher standards in certain areas is because there was political/scientific demand to go further than what the EU calls for.

I can accept that the UK sticks to current EU standards, I'd be happy with this as it will protect British consumers from the Tories setting a Thatcherite bonfire to regulations, but it is morally reprehensible and undemocratic to demand that the UK follow EU law going forward in their own country when they had no voice in the passing of those laws.",,/r/europe/comments/fasa15/eu_banks_tell_brussels_markets_are_no_place_for/fj0dg5z/,thecraftybee1981,1582897184

One big thing would be that the US would have less leverage over us, because Europe has basically no real army. If we combined our current spending we would still be before China or closely after it, enough money to deter any real threat.

Without a real need of US protection, we can pressure the US much more in following the EU's wants unless they want to be kicked out. And I think one of our most shared wants is not destabilizing the middle east which will always affect us, while never the US.

old people being more vulnerable DOESNT mean other people cant get pnemonia and cant die of it. that just mean they more likely to get it, and more likely to die.

thats first. second - you know how viruses work, right? like if you breath in 2-3 (i'm taking number from my head, just for example) virus cells. thats not enough to get you infected, your immune system detects em and kills em in some time. you're good. but if you breath in 2-3k (again, for exapmle), it's enough to get you infected, your immune system is unable to take them all down and you fall sick. 

and just try to imagine, which was the dose of the virus this dude got? all while being stressed, which also affects immune system in bad way.

Estonians don't want to adapt their state to the wills of the illegally-imported foreign minority. Either they integrate and enjoy the benefits, or they don't and they will lose out. It's really not that different from most other European countries except the scale due to our unfortunate history.

Then, base mdma isn't water soluble, but mdma hydrochloride is, at about 23mg/ml. So that leaves 400-ish milligrams in an average gulp. That's upper limit of what people might take recreationally, typical pill is 100mg-ish, but I've seen ppl take 4-5 pills over a night.. Anyway, my best guess is that this lady didn't ingest a crazy amount.  However. You can have an deadly reaction to mdma even on a normal dose. Very rare, but possible. Especially if you're already taking antidepressants. Very common in Belgium. So a high dose with some bad luck on top?

(GDP). This share has steadily decreased since 2012, when it stood at 49.7% of GDP.

Among the main functions of general government expenditure in the EU, ‘social protection’ is by far the most important, equivalent to 19.2% of GDP in 2018. The next most important areas are ‘health’ (7.0%), ‘general public services’ (6.0%) such as external affairs and public debt transactions, ‘education’ (4.6%) and ‘economic affairs’ (4.4%). The functions ‘public order and safety’ (1.7%), ‘defence’ (1.2%), ‘recreation, culture and religion’ (1.1%), ‘environmental protection’ (0.8%) and ‘housing and community amenities’ (0.6%) have more limited weights.

Social protection represented the most important area of general government expenditure in 2018 in all EU Member States. The ratio of government social protection expenditure to GDP varied across EU Member States from less than 10% in Ireland (9.0%) to nearly a quarter in Finland (24.1%) and France (23.9%). Five EU Member States – Finland, France, Denmark, Italy and Austria - devoted at least 20% of GDP to social protection, while Ireland, Malta, Latvia, Romania, Bulgaria and Czechia each spent 12% of GDP or less on social protection.

Christianity was evidently perfect religion for collapsing Empire with with the message of hope, equality and love.

Here is a community that invites you, which makes you an equal with all other members of that community. Which does not give you any disadvantages. On the contrary, it gives even the lowliest slave personal dignity and status. Moreover, the commandment of love is decisive. That is, the care for each other becomes very important.

Erdoğan's deal with EU about refugees has had been a disaster for him, monetary help didn't cover any refugee expenses, visa free travel promises weren't fulfilled, any refugee caught on EU soil was deported to Turkey, Turkish policy in Syria was opposed by EU and most importantly, Erdoğan lost votes because of refugees. Now either Europe has to help him or refugees arriving in EU will help the rising far right. If this free border policy becomes permanent and Turkish troops has to withdraw from Syria; refugees from all over Turkey ( now since it is only for 72 hours, many refugees will not make it to border in time), refugees still coming from Syria and refugees from Iran ( people coming from Afghanistan and Pakistan also come through Iran) will try to get into EU in hopes of making it to Western and Northern Europe.

It is not even unheard of people dying from cancer before they are able to commence treatment.

It is also very expensive - a cost that will primarily be levied onto the middle class. This is the situation in most, if not every, European country.

Not really. These aren't corporations, these are governments. If they made an OS/browser/..., all they have to do is bundle it into some kind of legislation about digitising education. Instead of text and notebooks, every kid gets a portable device (laptop, tablet, hybrid,...,) that has it preinstalled and unremovable. Same with school computers. Textbooks could be updated on the fly, homework and tests could be checked automatically,...  

If it worked well, it would spread as those children grow up, since if there's one thing we know about humans, it's that we're resistant to change. Why switch to Windows/Linux/Mac or Chrome/Firefox/Edge/... when you're used to the OS/browser/... you used throughout your education?

You have claimed that Coronavirus hits mostly wealthy people who frequently travel for business. I have argued that this is true right now, but will not be true in a future and is not true at all in the epicentrum of the virus in China or in countries neighbouring China.

This is because one can divide disease spread as either short-distance diffusion or long-distance jumps, i.e., through ships, planes or birds. And given that planes are generally expensive, poor people  cannot afford flying (although this is also not entirely true, a lot of spread was on the Chinese New Year and many people returning home from visiting family/friends in China), at the current stage, middle class would be more likely infected.

However, once the disease spreads further, as it did already in Italy, poorer classes of people would be more disproportionately affected. If (or when) the coronavirus gets into some refugee camp, you can count on that the coronavirus will infect almost everyone with cramped conditions and poor hygiene facilitating spread; and panic will spread with the disease.",,/r/europe/comments/fajmah/turkey_will_no_longer_stop_syrian_migrant_flow_to/fiz6x8f/,Unicorn_Colombo,1582855592

He's referring to something that can compel home users as well as businesses to use it on the desktop, instead of Windows and MacOS. Likewise for an EU-made browser, it's not enough to just bundle Chromium with a different skin.

Organizations and companies that make and leverage successful operating systems and other digital platforms, like browsers, mobile devices, or cloud, get to dictate how the digital world turns. For all intents and purposes, right now that's almost all American.

All major online services (be they built on Linux) are owned by American companies. People are chastised for using Facebook but what's their alternative? FB is not just gossip central, anybody who thinks that is naive. They've made themselves indispensable in many ways. You need them to organize or join events, to communicate with pretty much anybody, to promote your small business, to organize groups etc.

Where's the European-made and-hosted answer to these useful online tools? Where's the secure European messenger? Where's the alternative to having all our data under Google and Apple's lock and key? Well it's nowhere, because they control their own platforms and you either play nice or to home.

All these fines that the EU is waving around are empty posturing.

5520,"... The UK has officially agreed to no such thing at the current moment. The criteria in the GFA for when holding a poll in the North is appropriate is quite vague. Plus, we all know the DUP are vehemently against a border poll and the Tories will prob take that viewpoint on board. The only ones even broaching the topic with any level of planning are SF. My point was that it goes without saying that the Irish government wouldn’t force unity without a referendum on both sides, and would respect the North’s right to self-determination. The key issue here is - actually getting a border poll for both sides.

Also. They kept the EU customs border open as it was one of the key promises they made when exiting the EU, but not without first slandering Irish politicians and people over their views and purposely making the backstop out to be an unnecessary (undemocratic) barrier etc etc. Actually, their hatred for the backstop only proves they had no respect for the GFA and safety of the Northern Irish people and showed that they would have happily acted against their interests if they had been given the chance.

A nation's similarity to its past self (we'll call this historical legitimacy) is something all nation's should strive to be assuming this does not come into conflict with modern social progression and the functioning of democracy. I would argue the most valuable and effective way a nation can ""score historical legitimacy points"" is to have its source of sovereignty be the same as it has been for the majority of that nation's existence, and for most nations, including Austria, that was the crown. 

And re-establishing this does not have to come at the cost of any social progression (look at Scandinavia) and it does not interfere with democracy as you could always have an elected Govoner General type role to carry out internal head of state duties (such as intervening during crisis) and leave the monarch to the ceremonial and external-facing issues (such as hosting foreign delegates and appointing the PM).

I have skimmed the article stopping at the crucial points - and as I said - there is no data to really back up what is being proposed. There is no actual model behind the idea, there is no attempt in explaining why only a few countries are sliding back in their rule of law, the attempts to back up the claims by data are dubious - for example remittances resulting in stronger support for incumbent party and pointing out that Hungary has high part of GDP in remittance - with no word of commentary about Poland that has dropped the remittances significantly and yet faces the same problems. 

Nevermind that this researcher essentially cites himself for support of crucial conclusions essentially touting his own horn. I am not impressed enough by his work to go diving deep into his work to dissect it thoroughly.

Or use influence in the state trough family connections and cause misery for all. 


&gt;In socialism such fluidity is impossible and effect of nepotism is much more dangerous as it's spreads to other institutions, 

As if this only happens in socialism, as if wealthy private owners never become minister or presidents. 

&gt;tying it to judiciary and military.

Like a monarchy or like having the upper class be officers? It's well known wealthy private individuals tend to get better positions in militaries. 

&gt;Corruption has more place to inflict damage as state has control over companies.

A state run by those very same private individuals who run the companies that benefit from the state... 

&gt;There are many examples of socialists countries that went that way.

And many of capitalist countries run by rich private owners who act in their own intrest. 


&gt;I'm just living the fact that having family ties in businesses might actually have benefit when it comes to running company.

&gt;And sorry if this sounds rude, I never knew. I considered you guys one and the same, just in different countries.

That's fine. As long as you dont call us germans anymore it's completely fine. The annoying people are the ones that, after being told that we're no germans, still insist that we are. As if they knew better being foreigners and all.

&gt;If you have other things to add and share it is greatly appreciated.

It's just the general way of acting that greatly separates Austrians from germans. 

To get the elephant in the room out of the way, culturally Austrians and germans aren't really similar. The only germans that are similar to us are the Bavarians. And even within Bavaria there's many people that aren't similar to us. So there's really only a tiny part of germany that is similar to us Austrians. 

Another thing is that germans are very demanding. They don't ask for things when they want something they order it. If they want something to eat at a restaurant they don't use the subjunctive (would like) or say please/thanks, they'd say ""I want this"", which to us is incredibly rude. In Austria you'd say ""I'd like to have this, please."" and then a thanks. 

We Austrians are very proud of our country and of what we are, as well as our dialects. That's the polar opposite for germany. If you say you're a proud german in germany you're likely to be called a nazi by someone and if you speak a dialect in germany people think you're a some hillbilly.

5922,"\*\*After Brexit, who will be the British of the EU?\*\*

There are lots of contenders for the New Brit awards

Britain was an awkward member of the EU. It joined late, complained lots and has now become the only country ever to leave. Yet beneath the cantankerous caricature, Britain played a useful role. It championed a liberal vision of the EU and was a bulwark against dirigisme. British diplomats gummed up projects of which they were sceptical, such as a common defence policy, and accelerated those which they supported, such as the single market. Contrary to its self-image, Britain rarely stood alone in the EU. Britain was the noisiest advocate of policies that are commonly (but quietly) held across many member-states. Even with the Brits outside the bloc, those views will still be there. But the messengers will change. Who will they be? Welcome to the Brit awards, where your columnist will name the New Brits.

Sorting through the contenders is no easy job. There are so many. Take the EU's budget negotiations, which will come to a head this year. Britain was far from alone in its determination to curb EU spending. Rebates, whereby some countries receive back a chunk of what they put in, loom largest in British Eurosceptic lore, but other countries have secured them, too. A proposal in 2018 to do away with the cash carousel led to howls in Dutch, German, Swedish and Danish. Britain had exactly the same policy goals as other net contributor countries; it just had the loudest voice. Since then, Austria, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands have teamed up to turn up the volume. This skinflint foursome proudly refer to themselves as the Frugal Four. Any one of them could take the New Brit award for best Brussels belt-tightener.

Discomfort about the idea of the EU as a military power goes well beyond London. Germany does not want anyone to think it is throwing its weight around. On many issues, it prefers to remain in the back seat; when it comes to defence, it climbs into the boot. Any proposal that undercuts NATO's role as Europe’s defender makes German diplomats sweat; never mind their peers in the Baltic states, for whom NATO is the only thing that keeps Russian tanks at bay. Poland is even touchier. It has greeted attempts to forge a more European defence strategy by embedding itself ever deeper into America’s military nexus, slyly suggesting that a garrison on Polish soil could be called “Fort Trump”. Poland easily wins the New Brit award for defending the status quo on defence.

Beyond a few holdouts in the European Parliament, European federalism, the bête noire of British Eurosceptics from the moment Britain joined, has died a quiet death. EU wallahs may busy themselves with plans for a grand-sounding conference on the future of Europe later this year. But it will be a far cry from the constitutional convention of 2001-3, at which former French presidents and other grandees cooked up a European constitution (which was then rudely rejected by French and Dutch voters). Any suggestion of a similar effort this time round makes diplomats choke. Referendums, they have noticed, can be disruptive. The New Brit award for dreading federalism goes to everyone.

Liberal member-states have already clubbed together in the face of a more state-centric approach to the economy advocated most prominently by France. Dubbing themselves the New Hanseatic League, ministers from the Baltics, the Nordics, Ireland and the Netherlands now meet regularly to stave off statism (the Germans occasionally show up, too). Brexit has shaken the Dutch out of their political dysmorphia, in which the euro zone’s fifth-biggest economy tended to behave as if it were the size of Malta. As the de facto leader of the new league, the Netherlands wins the New Brit award for defending free markets from the French.

A Utopian fantasy still exists in some quarters that an EU without Britain will be more coherent. As the largest country outside the euro and the Schengen passport-free travel zone, Britain did stick out. But the eu will hardly be one-size-fits-all, even with the biggest constitutional kink ironed out. Denmark has opt-outs from the euro and justice and home-affairs policies. Ireland is not a member of the passport-free Schengen zone and has a common law legal system, unlike the civil law in the rest of the bloc. Special treatment abounds even when not written into law. Iron rules on fiscal discipline seem curiously flexible whenever France is involved. Visegrad countries (Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic) created their own opt-outs on migration policy by simply ignoring laws. Technically all countries bar Denmark are obliged to join the euro. Yet Sweden seems in no rush. Poland is five years from joining the common currency—and always will be, goes the saying. The eu will remain a constitutional camel rather than a thoroughbred even without Britain.

And the big winner is…

The fact that the Brit awards attract so many entries suggests that Britain was not such an odd man out. Once Britain has left, the EU will still have a rain-sodden, low-tax, English-speaking island in the north-west: Ireland. It will still host a former imperial power with a tendency to write geopolitical cheques it cannot honour: France. Likewise, anyone who thinks Britain was the only country with a morbid determination to bring up the second world war should glance at Polish politics. Perhaps Britain was a normal EU country after all.

Still, there can only be one overall winner. The Netherlands would be an obvious choice, given the similar policies of the British and Dutch governments. But the Dutch sit happily in the euro zone, as the Brits never would. Poland, like Britain, is outside the euro and recoils from European defence integration. Britain, however, was generally a constructive partner in the EU, which cannot be said of the current Polish government. This leaves one candidate. Liberal on trade, yet miserly when it comes to the EU's budget, this country also enjoys opt-outs on a Britannic scale. Congratulations, Denmark! It is a long time since Danes ruled half of England, but the two nations have much in common. ■",Born in the E.E.A,/r/europe/comments/fac5cy/after_brexit_who_will_be_the_british_of_the_eu/fix202w/,w00dy2,1582810600

5951,"After you reach a speed of like 30kph all the noise emitted is from air resistance. So that doesn't matter.

And the problem is nuclear is much bigger:

There are four real concerns with nuclear: time, cost, expertise and platform, which is the one you addressed.

First of all, you can count on 15+ years from now to completion of a new power plant.

Then, it is a massive multi-billion investment to build one nuclear powerplant. This is already causing massive hesitation.

Then, there is a limited number of people who know how to build a nuclear powerplant on a limited budget in a limited timeframe.

Also, we live in a democratic society, meaning that if people have concerns about a new power plant, these concerns need to be taken seriously. it doesn't matter if they are wrong, they still matter.

Now, let's put these three problems in the global warming framework. Let's assume Nuclear as 50+% of our energy mix by 2050 will be our target.

Globally we would need to build thousands of nuclear power plants, even though we're currently struggling to put out single digits. We'd need to find people to finance these thousands of plants, we'd need to find people who are able to design, build and operate them, and we'd need to find all these locations where people would accept a nuclear power plant in the vicinity. We'd run out of viable locations pretty quickly.

And we'd have to do this within 30 years

This is the actual reason why nuclear won't solve our problems. Nuclear has had it's (metaphorical) boom long ago, and now it's too late to start it back up.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/fa9qqm/eu_makes_cheap_cars_unaffordable_for_poor_people/fix27qe/,TheAmazingKoki,1582810763
