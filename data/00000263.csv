5,"&gt; in our school books, it sounded like the US beat the nazis, while the ""truth"" is that the hardest part of the war was fought by the UDSSR.

Hardest part of the war - in terms of blood? Absolutely.

Hardest part of the war - in terms of all the factors you need to a win a war, from equipment to logistics to tactics to strategy? Far more debatable, because war is about more than just how many died and how many you killed.

It'd be like saying China was the reason Japan lost in the Pacific - after all, more Japanese were killed fighting in China (and China itself suffered tens of millions dead) than in the Pacific Ocean.

But Japan - an island nation - having its Navy utterly smashed and its own home becoming defenseless against US naval and air forces - lost the part of the war that didn't have massive casualty counts, but had a far larger strategic and logistical impact on its ability to win a war.

In Europe, fear of Soviet treatment of German POWs led many Germans to keep fighting to the end rather than surrender. Consider this: more Germans surrendered to the Western Allies in one year of fighting than they did in the entirety of four years of fighting on the Eastern Front. So if you could fight an enemy and make them surrender, or fight an enemy until you and both sides are bloodied and lots are dead, which would you rather choose?",,/r/europe/comments/7r9bik/deaths_in_ww2_by_european_country_8582_6999/dswp100/,technique_only,1516341110

26,"""Kidnapping"" isn't a Chechen custom in the context you're applying. It's just, in the past, if a girl wanted to marry with somebody her family wasn't agreeing with at all, the guy could kidnap the girl meaning she can run away with him and that was her and his ""right"" to do. To assure that she wanted to go with him, the guy also had to call one of her female relatives within a day, and show that she is for it, she is totally fine and did it with her consent, etc. and both should seek apology of her family, bla bla. That's what ""kidnapping"" means. Today, in some many ceremonies, people act like the girl is running away, just to show that it's a marriage based on the romance, and girl would run away for the guy, in other words, guy would kidnap her. 

I don't know what ""sick"" stuff is, but Chechens even hadn't had invaded anybody's land during the times they can remember. Slavery was totally outlawed, the country was with democracy something similar to the Western democracies today, and even Tolstoy admired their democratic and free nature.

That's not to say that the EU might not give the UK a special get back in deal later as well, but it will probably not be as good as their current position, nor will EU legislators take account of the UK on policy after they leave meaning it may be less beneficial. 

My point is if the UK starts to have second thoughts towards the end of 2018 when the real effects of Brexit will start to show itself it should stop directly.

74,"&gt; Tatars are a remarkable minority: they are incredibly well-assimilated, but still maintain a strong awareness of their distinct cultural identity.

You'll find plenty of ethnic Russians complaining about Central Asian and Caucasian Muslims ""taking der jerbs"", but you will never hear them complain the same way about Tatars. It makes sense, as living under the same rulers for ~500 years will do that, but what's fascinating is that they still managed to retain their Tatar-ness through those 500 years.

You are somewhat right. A good amount of Chuvash live within Tatarstan, and the Chuvash are the Tatars closest kin. Most Chuvash are assimilated into Russian identity.

112,"Italy has (*checks*) two STOVL aircraft carriers.  She cannot fly aircraft off them that lack the ability to operate on these smaller carriers.  There are few aircraft rhat can do this.  I'm a layman, but I suspect that her military options look something like this:

* Give up aircraft carriers.  Depends on what Italy's foreign policy is, but this will significantly impact Italy's ability to act abroad.  I an not familiar with Italy's goals, but I would imagine that if she has carriers, she has them for a reason.

* Operate them only as helicopter carriers.  Again, depends on Italy's goals.  This will limit Italy's ability to fight other navies or attack targets in countries abroad.

* Continue to operate [Harriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_AV-8B_Harrier_II) from them.  These are being phased out by most other users already.  Depending upon Italy's goals, it's possible that these are acceptable.

* Use F-35Bs.

* Develop a new aircraft.  High-risk and for the number required, not going to save money unless the EU radically increases its demand for such aircraft and Italy can get people to buy it.  If this is what Italy wanted to do, switching after spending money on F-35B development probably does not make sense.

* Adopt a Russian or Chinese aircraft.  Limited options as well.  The risk will be higher for aircraft under development.

I'm not familiar with Italy's strategic goals, so it's hard for me to comment on what would make sense.

*Googles*

https://www.japcc.org/italian-naval-air-power/

According to this, Italy is looking to deal mostly with MENA.  If so, I guess that there aren't any real navies that she'd have to deal with and she'd probably be using the aircraft in an attack role.  It does say that she's also planning to start using [A129s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agusta_A129_Mangusta) off her carriers.  If she chose to only use these, I suppose that a disadvantage would be that they can't get high enough to avoid being vulnerable to [MANPADS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-portable_air-defense_system), which I imagine are an issue.

So 36,000 EUR/year?  Who cares?  If it helps deter a PM from using corruption to obtain cash at all, great.

Apple's CEO made $102 million last year at a company that had revenue of $230 billion last year.  The federal government has over an order of magnitude more revenue than Apple does, at $3.3 trillion.  Say pay for the President follows that ratio and is $1 billion/year.  Pay in installments and if he gets into trouble, he forfeits some of it.

Trump and Hillary both spent in the neighborhood of $1 billion running for President.

144,"&gt; That's not the reason why the houses in USA are made mainly from wood: cost of wood in USA is lower, there is more availability and when pioneers went to America there were a ton of unclaimed wood, not like the deforested Europe (remember all those major civilisations that inhabited the land? they chopped all the wood during centuries basically).

I don't know if you realize it, but when the Europeans first arrived in North America, it had also been deforested. By native Americans. Using the wood. For houses.

And yet. 

The native architecture used wood. Even though there were other materials available to them. Because that was what they had traditionally built with and it was what they were comfortable with. So they farmed wood. 

And modern American architecture uses wood, too, because of tradition, even though wood is more expensive to grow and we face regular shortages, and we farm wood even though the quality has gone down to the point that we keep having to revise the building codes to deal with less strength. We use wood because we have a native tradition of using wood.

I see you ignored my additional examples of adobe construction and the quonset hut. This is because you haven't traveled much in the US and don't really understand how those forms have influenced modern American architecture. You probably also have never studied the architecture of the US, which is not surprising. It's hard to study the architecture of another country from abroad, especially when what is being broadcast at you is a jumble of mashed up fakery that has little to do with the real America. 

Look, I know you feel pretty well educated, and I'm sure you are. But you know *nothing* about native American cultures. You don't know the first thing. You don't know how much of an impact they have had on modern American culture, and you dismiss every influence they have as I point them out. And I swear to god, I laughed out loud when I read this:

&gt;I know pretty well the native peoples, it's very interesting to me. I would say that probably know them better than some Americans. Always loved western movies and took interest in that, reading a lot.

Western movies? Are you kidding me? No. No, that is not what native culture is like. It just isn't. I don't even know what to say about ignorance that deep. That's such a profoundly stupid thing to say, as if I thought, say, Spain was a state in Germany. And yet you assert that as a sign that you know American native cultures. You know *nothing* if you think *western movies* which are well known to be *white stereotypes* of *faked up native peoples* played by *white people in brownface* will teach you anything about native Americans.

I would say the average American sixth grade public school kid knows native American culture better than you do if that if your primary source.

&gt;As for food What do you mean? We have that food too, who do you think brought that here?

I see. So somehow Americans have no native architecture, because it was brought over by Europeans (according to you, please do not say I thought such a stupid thing), and yet when American food was brought to Europe, that also somehow because European, because Europeans touched it? Do you have any idea how racist that sounds? Because it sounds *very* racist.

American food is so amazing it not only reshaped the diets of Europeans who immigrated to the US, but reshaped the diets of Europeans in Europe. *That* is a powerful culture. Sure, tapas have been a big thing in the US for the last 10 years, but what would Spanish food be without any native American foods?

&gt;Well, sadly the average European knows much better the US than any US citizen knows Europe.

I don't doubt that. The average American is pretty uneducated, which is how we ended up with this turd as a president.

We aren't talking about the intelligence of the average American, though, as fun as it is to shit on my fellow Americans. We are talking about cultural diversity in the US and whether native cultures have an impact on that.

&gt; Also, Europe is not a country and the history and culture of each country is so complex I don't even know more than the basics on every other country that is not Spain.

I don't know who said Europe was a country but it wasn't me. Go ahead and insult the intelligence of the average American, you won't hear me argue with you about that. But don't try to play like I don't know what Europe is. I am a citizen of an EU country and have lived in another.

I was just trying to talk about something of similar size so I was going for Europe as a whole rather than just Spain. If we are comparing cultural diversity of *just Spain* then the US beats you in number of cultures represented hands down, no problem. Alaska alone has more than 200 native peoples, and that's not counting any non-native people. Your country is tiny compared to the US; you just don't have the level of immigration the US has. The number of immigrants (both naturalized and not) living in the US right now is about equal to the *total population* of Spain. We're just not talking about the same scale of country at all. Which is why I wasn't comparing just Spain to the whole US.

&gt; When I said they were annihilated and not assimilated I mean your country stole their lands and confined them into reserves, they didn't get along each other incorporating the native culture into the emerging American culture.

What does annihilated mean? It means ""destroy utterly; obliterate."" The closest Spanish verb is ""aniquilar."" There are *2.9 million* native Americans alive today. Does that sound like they were utterly destroyed?

You can't simultaneously say ""you don't have many separate cultures represented in your country"" and then say it's sign of that that native cultures are not fully assimilated in mainstream US culture. We do have many separate cultures, and the fact that we have pockets of native culture surviving intact is a *sign* of cultural diversity, not the opposite.

&gt;It's probably as diverse as any other and possibly less than other older countries. 

If we're talking about older countries, maybe. We'll count the current version of your country, only, because you are counting the current version of mine. So if the US dates from 1776 (actually 1787 for the current constitution), your country dates from 1978. No comparison, the US is much older. In fact, there are surprisingly few countries in Europe whose current form of government existed 200 years ago. I would argue the US is more diverse than, say, Sweden or Norway; you can see the stresses of diversifying in those countries already. 

Otherwise, stop saying the US is only 200 years old. The house where I live is on land that has been in a city for thousands of years, through various occupying governments. If you are racist and think no culture that is not white counts, then even so, white people first came here around 500 years ago. That's quite a bit more history than you think the US has, which is ironic given who those white people were.

Look, Spain is a great country. My mother lived there for a year and loved it, I have visited and really enjoyed it.

Ekhm. Who is elected to rule a country is the personal choice of its people. Because people - as the ones living in that country are the best judges of rulers.

The fact that PiS despite having Brussels and most media in Poland aggainst it still has a rising support should tell you a lot about how Poles feel about the rule of pervious (more liberal) parties - that were liked by Brussel very much.

Angela Merkel - for putting in place ""Anti hate-speach"" law - that is in fact censorship as it is not clear what is hate speach or not - and even slightly anti liberal texts might be removed.

Macron - for undermining common market with delegated workers law as well as regulations that make it harder for smaller companies to compete. The regulatins naturally beneficial to larger countries.

Or if you like candy and cookies you should go see our old bakery museum.

And after that you can take a boat to [Enkhuizen](http://www.vvvhartvannoordholland.nl/content/plaats.asp?menu=0025_000109_000000_000000), also big in the time of the Dutch East India Company and visit the [Zuiderzeemuseum](http://www.zuiderzeemuseum.nl/en/10/home/) to find out how people used to live here back in the days.
Also lots of old buildings, and you can see more of how these kinds of cities used to be defended like old guard towers.

265,"&gt;whatever else has tentatively taken its place nowadays it's seen by most people just as make-believe. 

That's why I mentioned all that stuff about radiation emergencies: it is make-believe *in both directions*. 

The expectation of government *not helping* in the Eastern Europe is a bit exaggerated, because things did get better since the 1990s. But the expectation of government *actually helping* in the West is also exaggerated. 

Things are chaotic and nothing is guaranteed in emergencies. Even in a big city the help may take many days to arrive, if at all. Case in point: [Hurricane Katrina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_Hurricane_Katrina_in_New_Orleans#New_Orleans_Convention_Center). We can hardly say that the US was lacking money or other resources. 

So even a ""nice"" government is probably not coming to help in a major disaster.

Really the cost to the EU of this, geopolitically, with the US’ withdraw from global leadership under Trump, is huge. The UK will destabilise the EU from outside now, which will be very much to Russia’s benefit in European geopolitics and China’s economically.

284,"&gt;1) We have democratic oversight of EU laws by a) choosing representation in the EU parliament, and b) voting for governments who can veto measures or ratify laws and treaties.

An EU Parliament that cannot propose legislation. That power resides solely with the unelected Commission. It's democracy by dynamic, and it's not good enough. 

&gt; 2) We will lose a degree of 'sovereignty' anyway in the case of an FTA that compels us to align ourselves with other blocks in order to trade. 

No more than we have already lost. It's rules our exporters will have to adhere to only if they wish to trade with the EU. They won't effect domestic policy. 


&gt;3) The idea of sovereignty is dicey considering our shitty two party system beholden to lobbying and coprorate interests. 

Albert Venn Dicey (irony), British constitutional theorist, defines sovereignty as a ability to make or unmake any law. While we are in the EU, there are certain laws we cannot unmake without first unmaking the European Communities Act. First past the post has nothing to do with it, although for what it's worth I woukd certainly support some forms of proportional representation.

As for your question regarding ""who sees cultural assimilation as racism"", this is large prevailing view in current post-modernistic philosophy. I personally consider it as fringe, and not mainstream, however it is loudest and oft promoted. This ideology is currently mainstream ideology within university humanities in US, Canada or UK. Although, it is more pervasive accross the pond than here.

As an example you can see this article which links cultural assimilation with racism

341,"This sounds like it is from Douglas Murray's book. In one chapter he argues that the loss of belief in Christianity has left a void inside of Western Europeans. Christianity provided a spiritual basis to the big questions that every human has. What are we doing here, what is our purpose and what happens to us after we die. The painful 20th century with the deaths of millions over fascism, socialism, petty nationalism and so on have given Western Europeans a civilisational tiredness. 

So we resort to those hedonistic things which I think began in the 1960s. Now many people realise that those things aren't worthwhile. There must be more to life than just going on a nice holiday and getting a new car. 

What enters this spiritual void? Islam. It has no uncertainty. The Koran is literally the word of god (not true of even the bible). The path is laid out quite clearly. The clerics aren't soft Church of England types. They actually believe in what they say. It can be a powerful, liberating message to uncertain people who are given the burden of figuring out what the hell they're here for and how they should live their life.

357,"&gt; The shape and form of native buildings strongly influenced American architecture. You know how Europeans always express shock at how American houses are made entirely from wood? Guess who that came from?

That's really interesting, but we're even comparing? That's not the reason why the houses in USA are made mainly from wood: cost of wood in USA is lower, there is more availability and when pioneers went to America there were a ton of unclaimed wood, not like the deforested Europe (remember all those major civilisations that inhabited the land? they chopped all the wood during centuries basically).

&gt; You can visit museums and see historical costumes and handcrafts of native peoples all over the US (usually regionalized, so you would have to travel to see the local native cultures).

Yeah, there are museums here too. And while I find pretty interesting the American natives I think that our cultural ancestors are much more varied and they left a much large footprint on our day to day costumes.
&gt; 
&gt; You learn the local cultures in addition to the history of European cultures in American public schools.

I really doubt you learn about European history and culture at the same level of any European citizen unless you have a degree in History. Also, Europe is not a country and the history and culture of each country is so complex I don't even know more than the basics on every other country that is not Spain.

&gt; As for food
What do you mean? We have that food too, who do you think brought that here?

&gt; I know it's a bit much for a European to be expected to understand the US. 

Well, sadly the average European knows much better the US than any US citizen knows Europe. That's because USA it's the most influential nation in the world. We consume all your shit, your movies, your music, we know the name of your presidents, we know your civil war, we know the history of the pioneers in the old west. In the other hand I hear all the time Americans who thinks Spain is in Mexico and things like that.
I know pretty well the native peoples, it's very interesting to me. I would say that probably know them better than some Americans. Always loved western movies and took interest in that, reading a lot.
The apache wars, Cochise, Navajo nation and their codes used for communications in WW2 and Korea, everybody knows the Inuits, etc...
I didn't say they are dead. I know pretty well there a still a lot of them and they still live in ""their land"". When I said they were annihilated and not assimilated I mean your country stole their lands and confined them into reserves, they didn't get along each other incorporating the native culture into the emerging American culture. I don't say that's good or bad, there were other times and every country has done that kind of shit, but that's not what happened during thousand of years in Spain with each nation. Maybe the jews where the only ones who where driven out without much cultural remains.

&gt; I didn't say that, by the way. I specifically said, ""I'm not interested in a pissing match about which is better because I think both countries are interesting and full of culture in their own ways.""

Well, I intervened because one guy was saying that USA is much more culturally diverse than any other western country. Which I, and many others judging by the downvotes, think it's false. It's probably as diverse as any other and possibly less than other older countries.
I end writing all of this because it's a bit annoying to continually read a lot of misconceptions about European countries here all the time. It shows that the US in general have a very self centered view of the world. Just think about the president you have now, the ignorant declarations about other countries he makes, and that he was supported by half the population.

When it comes to cultural trait, you also have a pyramid there. Of things that you consider most important and beneficial to society all the way down to national / regional, often silly quirks that come as pretty huge amusement to those from outside (like for example in Bulgaria nodding the head means no, in Slovakia and Czechia during easter its tradition of ""whipping"" and so on).

The big ones being separation of church and state. Democratical values and liberal system as first defined by John Locke and leading from it. Removal of taboo on sex. Equality between males and females. These all are paramount beneficial to our societies as proven by history. If arriving group believes that religious law should be primary and civic secondary, they either need to assimilate by full removal of that mindset or it will come to clash (remember those Sharia4Britain, Sharia4Belgium and so campaigns? You know what they led to, they became literal instrument in ISIS recruitment).

And what I consider something that ends up worse, is when arriving society / group / culture calls directly, or via proxies, on reverse cultural assimilation.

 Its a mimic of the nationalist groups in the host countries, just taking arbitrary cultural trats and setting them as boundaries, that way they get to create a paralell identity and assert themselves, its just reactionary.

Russia will economically-punish Finland for joining NATO.  So Finland has to weigh a possible cost — Russia attacking — with a certain cost — punishment from Russia.

Finland gambled badly in 1939 that neutrality would be sufficient and that Russia would not attack.

However, since World War II, Russia has not attacked, so the gamble has paid off.

My guess is that ""will Russia attack Finland"" is probably a matter of importance in Finland's foreign policy and that the decision was not taken lightly.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7r91g5/nato_drawing_in_a_finnish_highschool_book_made_by/dsw0pn7/,vokegaf,1516312506

""a country, especially when thought of as a large group of people living in one area with their own government, language, traditions, etc.: ""

or 

""a large group of people of the same race who share the same language, traditions, and history, but who might not all live in one area""

German and Austrian traditions are similar, but different. There are so many differences between Danes, Swedes and Norwegians but somehow you see these different ethnic groups that share somewhat similar ancestry as part of a ""nation"". 

&gt;The German nation also includes Austria, most of Switzerland, parts of Luxembourg, parts of Belgium, parts of Italy

Do you get your information directly from internet memes? Just because northern Italy was part of the HRE for a while doesn't make it a part of a ""German nation"". Also, you made up your definiton of a nation and called it German, you literally just made up your definiton of what you think ""a German nation"" is. 

&gt;I am not a nationalist, so I don't think these nations have to be in the same state but I think today a federal European state would be advisable at this point for a number of reasons. The best template we'd have for this would be Switzerland but I don't agree with all of their system.

Do you also make up your own definition for what ""being a nationalist"" is?

It's not just that the 500,000-800,000 job loss prediction was wrong. The FT today has an article ""The Bank of England's anti-Brexit bias threatens its credibility"" which says this:

&gt; In August 2016, the bank produced updated forecasts. Exports in 2017 would be down 0.5 per cent, despite the strong boost they had received from the devaluation of sterling. Looking at the year-on-year figures for the third quarter, in practice they are up 8.3 per cent. Over the same period business investment in 2017 would be down 2 per cent. Yet, in the most recent Office for National Statistics figures, it is up 1.7 per cent. Housing investment would be down 4.75 per cent. Looking at the most recent data (end September), it is actually up 5 per cent year-on-year. Employment growth would be zero. In reality, it is up 1 per cent from already very high levels.
&gt; 
&gt; The bank’s forecasts were so far adrift as to be embarrassing. And because the Bank of England not only makes predictions but also sets monetary policy, poor forecasting can lead to poor policy

The reality is that the ""experts"" have a long track record of being very wrong and wrong in the wrong direction.

693,"Turks might be the biggest ethnic group, but not the only one.
Furthermore, during Turkey's War of Independence, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk promised the Kurds that the new country would be a country for both nations. That is one of the main reasons why Kurds fought on Turkey's side, unlike the Arabs, Greeks, Armenians, etc. During that war, Kurds were your only allies left. Look up who defeated the colonialists in Urfa, Antep, etc. Kurds did. Who defended the East? Furthermore, thousands of Kurds fought in Canakkele and Galipolli and died there. Go to the cemeteries there and see how many people from Hakkari, Diyarbakir, Urfa, Mardin, Bitlis, Van, etc. are buried there! So with this context in mind, I believe your reasoning is illogical, wrong, and immoral. 

How did Turks thank the Kurds for their support? Not only by completely ignoring the promise Ataturk made, but also by renaming all their towns and cities, banning their language, banning Kurdish names, banning Kurdish culture and traditions, by massacring them... And you complain about the PKK?

Never. Bad governments come and go. We currently have an awful government, but I would choose that over any perfect EU government any day. Democracy and the freedom to choose who leads you is too precious to let go. Besides, you're working on the idea that the EU will always be doing well or will always be run by competent individuals.

Sure, *some* people don't like eastern Europeans, but don't pretend that that applies to all of us, or that eastern Europe is a beacon of tolerance. I've lived in Poland and Albania. The UK is paradise compared to those countries when it comes to racism and xenophobia.

But there's some truth in what you say. Many of us aren't in favour of distributing our money to poorer countries, or at least not as much as we do now. But we aren't completely against it. That being said, we hate the Common Agricultural Policy about a billion times more.

To be clear, though: our opposition to giving you money has nothing to do with who you are. We hate giving it to the French and Germans far more.

784,"&gt;Hey, we only entered because you asked us

Very false.

EXPLANATION EDIT : We entered so that we could save our colonies in Africa from the Germans. We entered because we thought that fighting an ultra heavily industrialised country almost 11 times more populated than us alone just might not be a good idea in the era of industrialised warfare. We were very aware of the fact that we weren't in the times in which we actually could think ""*meh, we can fight and win battles in which we literally [are 170 times less](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cochin) against civilizations as advanced as us in enemy territory because we are valiant, bad-ass, skilled, have awesome tactics and that we, the Portuguese, are God's chosen people*"". The acceleration of weaponry technology and industrialisation quite changed our war-hawk set of mind and over-developed our (already very good) diplomatic talents. Which we used there. We knew that participating into WWI and being on the winning side would just secure our colonies from the Germans (and the fucking Brits, that we knew thanks to our spies, wanted to back-stab us once again and ""give"" our colonies to Germans so that peace could be agreed. You read that sentence right. The Brits didn't want us to go to war for that very reason, and we still went after influencing the French to pressure the Brits to ""ask us to block the German navy in Lisbon"").",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/7r8nir/world_war_1_mobilized_forces_per_total_population/dsve585/,MestreBigode,1516290851

850,"Good to know Treaty on European Union is theoretical. Then a would say NATO is also theoretical, since it is also based on a treaty. Exactly how many times has Article 5 been tested in a real world situation?

And is the harm to edge positioned troops any more greaater incentive to act for NATO countries, than the incentive caused by disruption to everyday business of EU and say the Schengen zone and Single market by for example Russian incursion to Finland?

These are all treaty based, wordings may be harsher or leaner. Thing is the real quarantoor is not the level of treaty language. Treaty is just a piece of paper. The quarantoor is society's will and incentive to honor said treaty, whenrubber meets the road.

You think rest of EU is going to stand aside and not act, when one of it highly politically and economically integrated members is under attack? It isnt just about damage to Finland, but say damage carried to say Italy or France via the disruption of single market. Or how about disruption to EU institutions located in Finland. There is kinda a reason EU machinery and agencies are distributed among members. It literally makes attack on one, attack on all via the propagating distrupting effects.

USA? Whole Europe could stop existing or get magically frapped in glass and would not affect everyday live in USA minus the petrified Troops and bases. Ocean in between is a kinda good insulator of sorts.

 Finland gets attacked it might immediately  affect everyday goods prices via whole EU due to the integrated nature of Union. The EU business critical services of European Chemicals Agency located in Helsinku, Finland would stop etc.

Sweden and probably Norway would see immediate civilian evacuation specially of children to further away from the front. This happened in WWII it would happen now.

854,"In the Sahel various jihadist groups have come together under the flag of the islamic state and have declared war to the counter-terrorism force of the G-5 (FG-G5S) made up of Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Ciad.

It was announced by a jihadist spokesperson to the french agency Presse. The group, lead by Adnan Abu Walid Saharaoui that calls itself “islamic state in the broader Sahara” (ISBS), has stated of being responsible of various terror attacks, which took place in the five african countries. Amongst them the attack agains the french forces of Operation Barkhane in Mali and the one that killed four members of the US special forces and as many nigerien soldiers the 4th of october.

ISBS makes it knwn that in the Sahel is active in the “zone of the three borders”. That is the one between Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. Exactly in the area in which will be concentrated the activity of the FC-G5S. “we will do everything to make sure that the counter-terrorism [force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuK6n2Lkza0) won’t be installed in this area”, said the ISIS spokesperson, a close and longstanding collaborator of Adnan Abu Walid Sahraoui who identified himself as “Amar”.

“our brothers Iyad Ag Ghali and other mujaheddin like us are defendin Islam”, he continued while refering to the malian tuareg leader of Ansar Dine. “to fight the infidels, we go hand in hand – he concluded – we will continue to fight together”.

The new jihadist alliance is worrisome not just for the countires of the G-5 but also for thei european allies that are about to deploy military contingents in the Sahel in addition to the alredy present french and *statunitensi* [united-statesian, that is, american] troops.

Its not yet clear who actually is joining, but to the ISBS could have even joined groups belonging to the opposing galaxy of al-Qaeda that in the Sahel manifest itself in the form of al-Mourabitoun and also with al-Qaeda in the islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Beside, the two formations, together with Ansad Dine in march of 2017 had ufficially declared their fusion in the new group Jama’at Nasrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen, that means “support to islam and the muslims”.

At the head of the new formation stands Iyad Ag Ghaly, to wich Sahraoui was talking to in the communique. but at the moment from the leader have yet to come any sort of comment or response and thus isn’t clear if the alliance has joined ISBS or not.

There are also no comments for the algerian Makhtar Belmokhtar, the leader of al-Mourabitoun, active especially in Mali. The terrorist group, and opponet of ISIS, was officialy born the 22 of august of 2013 with at the head the egyptian Abu Bakr al Muhajir. But he was killed in a raid of the french special forces in april of 2014. Following his death, the leadership of the formation went to Tilemsi who was also killed by Paris’ commandos in december of the same year. The only one left alive is Belmokhtar, that since then as taken control of the organisation.

Belmokhtar is a vey charismatic character, considered a legend and nicknamed “the uncatchable” by the french intelligence and “mister malboro” by the locals because he became rich with the smuggling of tobacco in the Sahel. Or also “the one-eyed” because of war wound. He is an islamist veteran that fought against the soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s. the malian spies think that he has many contacts not just with the jihadist groups in the region but also with the tuareg tribes amongst which he is considered a “friend” for his important role that he had in the battle against the regular forces of the country in order to obtain the indipendece of Azawad, unilateraly declared the 6th of april 2012 and ceased the 14th of february 2013.

862,"As the President of the French Republic meets with the British Prime Minister in Sandhurst on Thursday, it is crucial that he does not lose sight of the fact that Brexit has not yet been completed. A new referendum could well be held on its terms, and that is likely to be the case, once its conditions are defined, but before the departure of the United Kingdom on 29 March 2019.

It is therefore essential that Emmanuel Macron - who passionately believes in a strong and united Europe - continue to express his sincere support for Britain's continued membership of the European Union, if that is the will of the sovereign British people. While some in Brussels, Paris and Berlin believe that they can take advantage of Brexit for commercial purposes, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel fully understand that the disadvantages of Brexit, in the long run, would far outweigh any immediate advantage.
Theresa May's mistakes

Why am I so confident that the Brexit process can still be stopped? When Theresa May became Prime Minister eighteen months ago, she called for national unity behind the very small majority of British voters who voted in favour of Brexit in the June 2016 referendum. Unwittingly bartering her unenthusiastic support for maintaining Brexit's stance in the European Union for a hard Brexit position, she naively hopes to appease both the right wing of her party and Nigel Farage, the leader of the Ukip identity party, by supporting the idea of leaving both the European Customs Union and the single market.

This national unity will not be achieved. The idea of a ""Hard Brexit"" has alienated not only the British business community but also many moderate voters and the majority of young people who vehemently oppose a ""fortress United Kingdom"" that would restrict their freedom to live, love and work across Europe. This idea is also causing a crisis, both in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland, as the idea of seeing a new ""hard border"" encircling the island in two is so displeasing.

In an attempt to resume the initiative, Mrs May is therefore calling the early elections last June. It's a total failure. Ms. May is the victim of a dramatic reversal caused in large part by the vote of young people (many of whom did not take part in the referendum), she loses the relative majority she enjoyed and the Labour Party is making significant progress, both in Parliament and in public opinion. Under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party is reluctant to make a firm commitment against Brexit, but voters - especially young people - want to believe that Labour will eventually oppose the Hard Brexit and even the whole of Brexit. Rightly so: the DNA of the Labour Party is fundamentally European.
Revolution of opinion

Opinion polls over the past few months have shown that a majority of the British are now opposed to Brexit, and we are witnessing the emergence of a very sensitive surge of support for EU membership among the under 50s. The exorbitant cost of Brexit, in particular, is frightening, with many reports suggesting that British growth is now 0.9% below what it would have been if Britain had voted to stay in the EU, which amounts to a loss of almost £350 million per week, which is precisely, as everyone knows, the amount that supporters of the exit from the Union had claimed could be ""recovered"" from the EU.

We are also witnessing a change in the tone of Brexit's media coverage in the UK. Until recently, the break-up was considered inevitable, and the only issue regularly dealt with was the ""conditions under which Britain could protect itself from Brussels"". Now this split is no longer considered inevitable, and commentators rightly point out that while Brexit monopolises the UK's energy, our European partners continue to build a single market for services, deepen the integration of their economies and stimulate trade. My fellow citizens are well aware of this: the curse of Brexit would be, if we continued along this path, to be obsessed with it for a decade, if not two.
Behind the Brexit, the social crisis

Brexit's capacity for nuisance turns us away from Britain's real challenge: to deal with the major social crisis affecting the country's poorest cities and regions, those who have spoken out in favour of leaving the EU to send a strong signal of protest to the London elite.

That's something you hear a lot, but it's wrong. It was a type of ""study"" done in the Netherlands as well during the 2014-2015 mass influx of refugees, to assuage fears that the refugees could be criminals. 

What they did was take refugees in refugee centers where petty crime was handled internally and occasional riots and fights were tolerated and refugees who sexually assaulted other refugees were not handed over to police, and say ""look, police aren't arresting these people, they seem to be your moral superiors, you bigots, so don't you dare complain about them."" It was a tremendous feat of massaging raw figures to reach a politically necessary conclusion.

Of course, the other side of the coin is that refugees, once they receive permanent residence/citizenship (and are no longer stuck in centers with curfews that hide their crimes), are three times as likely to be criminals as the general population.

If there's one thing Europe should have learned from the Bush jr saga in the US: do not cheer if an seemingly bad choice gets replaced by a wolf in sheep's clothing. Usually, the one you're cheering for is way worse.

Not sure why Clinton got cheered on considering her speeches in the runup to the elections by European politicians, since if she were a Rep instead of an Dem she'd probably be booed at - while Clinton's agenda wasn't that far off when it comes to foreign policies in comparison to Bush jr, and was also a large step back when it comes to Obama (remember her wish to execute Snowden with a drone strike, or put Manning in the death chamber, or invade Iran while saying that the US would shoot down any Russian aircraft in Syria or Iran if they threatened to interfere with US actions if it was up to her?).

The Internet determines an increasing amount of whether a country ""exists"" in the eyes of the public -- and controlling one's own root nameservers would do that.  Today ISO does that.

Today, Kosovo and South Ossetia do not have TLDs.  But if Russia had her own roots, she could ensure that Kosovo continues to not do so and that South Ossetia does have one in the eyes of Russians.

1080,"&gt;Perusing Jewish interests

Literally how? Lenin (Figurehead of the USSR's foundation) abhorred ethnic Anti-semitism, but directly was hostile to all religious practices, including Christian, Jewish, Islamic and Orthodox practice, going so far as to say 'All modern religions and churches, all and of every kind of religious organizations are always considered by Marxism as the organs of bourgeois reaction, used for the protection of the exploitation and the stupefaction of the working class.'. And what would Jewish interests be anyway. If you refer to Israel (A commonly cited example), then why did the Soviets later support more Arab nations and eventually support Palestine int eh Israel-Palestine conflict? If otherwise, why did the Soviets abolish Jewish community councils?

&gt;Created and run by Jews

OK we get it, Lenin was ethnicly Jewish, but not only did he pay no thought to it, Stalin was not Jewish in any way often held quite clearly antisemitic views and policies, like the famous 'Doctors Plot' which made ethnic Jews somewhat of a target.

&gt;They were killed on basis that they were Christians.

No, not only were Priests and Bishops only killed, they were killed because they were Religious Leaders, Imams, Kohens, Baptists were also persecuted. while a tragedy, that is the nature of such ruthless state atheism. Individual practice of religion was discouraged, but never actively persecuted too. 

&gt;(Ukrainians were in conflict with jews and it was a revenge).

[CITATION NEEDED] If the deaths were intention (Which is already a stretch) then it would be to curb the Ukrainian independence movement most likely. If it were revenge for treatment of the Jews, then why did the Soviets ever ally with Nazi Germany with their non aggression pact.

&gt;The same laws should apply to all big genocides or non of them
Agreed, and personally I don't really think that Denial should be illegal personally, but that does not excuse spreading this revisionism and falsifications to such an extent.

1140,"&gt; The German state was responsible for these atrocities and it owes a debt to make sure its populace cannot forget what its past is and what could happen if people are not alert.

Uhuh, so because the German state, a state that no longer exists and occupied a slightly different land area was responsible then people who were born after that have a responsibility now?

This is why I think tribalism is so fucking stupid; sooner or later later it always comes down to ""hold people accountable and responsible for something they never did but whom people place in the same 'tribe' with their fallacious markov-chain machine.""

The _persons_ who were responsible have been dealt with (hopefully) but this mentality of holding people who weren't even born back then responsible just because ""same tribe hurr durr"" is ridiculous.

&gt; Human lives have value and killing innocents on such a barbaric scale is something no one should accept.

Then why is the holocaust special? Why doesn't it apply to all the other events? Why can you ""deny, trivialize and relativize"" what Stalin did?

&gt; Denial would be publicly promoting falsehoods

Oh please, if publicly promoting falsehoods was a crime in the general case then religion would be illegal; falsehoods have always been allowed to be promoted.

&gt; and belittling would be promoting an abherrant value system which Germany wants to make sure never takes place.

How about the simple alternative explanation: 'it's a sensitive issue people get emotional about ignoring that there were a tonne more identical mass murder events in history they aren't emotional about.""

Don't pretend like there is actual consistent reasoning behind it; it's purely because it's a sensitive, emotional issue in Germany.

&gt; This is Germany's past and Germany's responsibility.

1181,"Here is the problem with your logic: most Muslim families will probably not care too much. I lived in Middle East and have seen girls of all ages without hijab. Their school uniforms include one, but as soon as they leave the building they just take it off. No one is policing young girls to wear hijab in normal everyday circumstances. 

That being said, we all know there are groups out there who take their religion far too seriously. Unfortunately those very conservative families that will care about such thing, will just stop sending their daughters to public school. So not only will those girls still wear their hijabs, but they will also miss out on education that might give them empowerment to stand up to their oppressive relatives. 
Nothing wrong with hijab. It’s just a scarf on your head that does no harm to others. I believe it would be better solution to teach girls just that, instead of punishing them for something that they have no influence upon. Most importantly, they need to be thought that it is their choice to wear it or not. You need to pick your battles. Let the girls go to school hijab or not, and make it your goal to teach them critical thinking.

It kinda has. One of the reason why so many Americans are obese is becouse they never walk anywhere.

There is no such thing, you created yourself a myth. Urban sprawl happens everywhere in the US, as a matter of fact, the biggest suburbs are lying nearby the biggest economic hubs. There are no major differences between the midwest and US shores when it comes to choosing a dwelling type. People are driving to their google job from their detached house much more often than from their downtown flat.

Hydra / Ydra town has a real charm. (No motorised transport on the island.)

Other less obvious favourites include -
Trizonia, Kythera, Elafonisis, Kalamos (Ionian)

There are also many so small uninhabited islands with splendid isolation. 

I suppose it depends what you are looking for but if I had to choose one island, i would probably choose Zakynthos. Stunning countryside and mountains as well as a beautiful coast.

We asked them to pay close attention to the juniors, because the main problems we have there, and not in high performance sport.

That is?

– Someone really could disease, and someone just didn't came.

– So is the official protocols. At first people were in the application and then suddenly withdrew.

Protocols now serves only through information technology system. And applications will begin approximately two weeks before the start, and ends in three days.

1438,"&gt;Really? I thought that Serbs mostly want to try to keep ethnic Serbs in one state, as much as possible? Which I think is a perfectly reasonable aim (of course, it needs to be done through peaceful negotiation not war).

It's different with Kosovo, with historical and cultural ties we have to it, it's mostly all of it, not just ethnic Serbs.  

&gt;I mean a negotiated and mutually agreed population exchange. The enclave Serbs would be given the choice to remain in their homes but within the state of Kosovo, or to be moved to a new part of Serbia cut out from the edge of Kosovo, and given appropriate housing to compensate them for the homes. I don't mean forcibly moving anyone. 

I don't think they'd agree to it, after all they stayed because that's their ancestral home  

&gt;Do Serbs still hope to regain the whole of kosovo? It seems futile, like Greeks still hoping to get Constantinople back. Sometimes reality sucks but needs to be accepted. 

Not regain, but a lose confederation with it, or a hong-kong and china scenario would be good.  

&gt;Hmm, well hopefully a peaceful way forward can be found. Do you think there will be any serious effects from the murder of the Bosnian Serb politician recently?

Well there already are, it was the last straw for the Serbs in Brussels, Serbia has been negotiating and fullfilling all its Brussels arrangements, while Kosovo didn't do crap. Now even a leading politician is dead.  
&gt;Btw, thank you for discussing this with me. I'm happy to be learning more about the situation in the Balkans and also to hear a Serbian point of view, because I have never met a Serb or talked to one before :D It's a really interesting area of the world.

No. It originally comes from WW1 and was then assumed to also have happened in the Second World War. It's actually somewhat true for the First World War. In the beginning of the war Russia had a shortage of rifles, like many other countries as well. 

Like Britain they bought Arisaka rifles from Japan, more than half a million. It was pretty common during the First World War. Russia, France and the UK bought rifles from USA.

i will reiterate and elaborate, since it seems you cant interpret things inside your head: 

&gt;...what this textbook is actually trying to say, is that there are over 4.3 million **foreigners/immigrants** in italy

the textbook might be saying that there are 4.3 million refugees in italy (i say ""might be,"" because this part could have been mistranslated). however, what it means is that there are 4.3+ million **foreigners** (just so you understand, a foreigner to italy can be an immigrant, a migrant, a refugee, or anyone that wasnt born inside italy). 

the problem isnt the number 4.3 million, thats correct. there ARE 4.3+ million foreigners in italy. the problem with this book is that instead of using foreigner, they, for propaganda purposes, use the word refugee.

1479,"There's [New Classical Architecture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Classical_architecture), which is interesting but a bit of a mixed bag. Some of it includes really skilful reproductions of earlier styles. Others (and the best of it imo) are a fusion of classical and modern design. And some others are kitsch, of course, but you inevitably get that when classical teachings have been effectively phased out of most architectural schools. 

The best of it includes buildings like [this](http://i.magaimg.net/img/2dl0.jpg), I think. They conform to enough modernist principals to potentially be accepted by the admittedly dogmatic and ideologically-driven architectural institutes of today, but also have touches of classicism, especially in their proportions. As much as I love some of the really ornately beautiful styles of the past, like Art Deco and Art Nouveau, I just don't think the world is ready to jump back into similar styles at the moment, and architects especially would oppose it ferociously. 

But I think the problem lies with architects in large part, because they've wrapped themselves in an echo chamber for 70 years now. This shows itself most in some of the 'award winning' buildings that pop up every year. Architects adore them, but the public almost always hate them, and this highlights a disconnect. And I'm uncertain as to whether architectures generally don't realise this disconnect exists, or just don't care. I actually sort of lean towards the former. I had great interest in becoming an architect, but decided I didn't want to be apart of institution that is often so unfriendly to anything that doesn't fit into its rigid set of aesthetic principals. 

I'd recommend looking into the so-called ['Berlin Style'](http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=2004897), a kind of architecture that has been popping up mostly in Berlin over the last decade or so. Again, it's modern and sleek but still classically beautiful — probably the best you can hope for today. You might also be interested in the growing reconstruction wave that's taking place (mostly) in Germany. Lots of German cities are undergoing moderate reconstruction of parts of their historic oldtowns, usually destroyed or heavily damaged in WWII bombing raids. This includes cities like Dresden, Frankfurt, Potsdam, and Berlin. Increasingly, other cities are advocating for rebuilding waves of their own. This is, of course, a reaction against the modern rebuilding do these places in the 50s/60s.

But 3D printing and a growth of similar technologies could radically change the direction of architecture, for good or ill. Changes also depend on the social, political, and economic developments that take place in the next decades.

&gt;Nationalism is a political, social, and economic system characterized by promoting the interests of a particular nation, particularly with the aim of gaining and maintaining self-governance, or full sovereignty, over the group's homeland. The political ideology therefore holds that a nation should govern itself, free from unwanted outside interference, and is linked to the concept of self-determination. Nationalism is further oriented towards developing and maintaining a national identity based on shared characteristics such as culture, language, race, religion, political goals or a belief in a common ancestry. Nationalism therefore seeks to preserve the nation's culture. It often also involves a sense of pride in the nation's achievements, and is closely linked to the concept of patriotism. In some cases, nationalism referred to the belief that a nation should be able to control the government and all means of production

Saying that it has to do with supremacy just to hit nationalism below the belt is pretty weak. ",Greece/Canada,/r/europe/comments/7r525s/great_nationalist_speech_relevant_for_all/dsucvlc/,Keldore,1516233437

Now, just now you were whining about working under slavery-like conditions, 24h and in the cold. And now you're back trolling. Which is it? Let's get back to the subject, shall we?


&gt; **Refugees are not required to have come ‘directly’ from their country of origin. The intention, reflected in the practice of some States, appears to be that, for Article 31 (1) to apply, other countries or territories passed through should also have constituted actual or potential threats to life or freedom, or that onward flight may have been dictated by the refusal of other countries to grant protection or asylum, or by the operation of exclusionary provisions, such as those on safe third country, safe country of origin, or time limits. The criterion of ‘good cause’ for illegal entry is clearly flexible enough to allow the elements of individual cases to be taken into account.**

http://www.unhcr.org/publications/legal/419c778d4/refugee-protection-international-law-article-31-1951-convention-relating.html

&gt;  **The fact that Article 78 TFEU provides that the common policy on asylum must be in accordance with the Geneva Convention and that Article 18 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union makes clear that the right to asylum is to be guaranteed with due respect for that convention and the Protocol relating to the status of refugees of 31 January 1967**

http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=155104&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=1st&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=321873

&gt; A person may be qualified as a refugee in the sense of Article 1 letter A of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (Geneva Refugee Convention – hereinafter GRC) if he or she enters Germany with the intention to apply for asylum. **This even applies in the case of entry via a safe third country as long as it has to be assumed that the country, due to systemic deficiencies, does not provide for adequate protection in accordance with the standards required by the Geneva Refugee Convention.**

&gt; **A refugee does not lose the protection provided by the Geneva Refugee Convention by entering via a third country if he or she only uses that country as a country of transit. The term “directly” only excludes those who have already resided elsewhere.**

&gt; The privilege of not being punished for illegal entry or presence accorded to refugees by the Geneva Refugee Convention does not place an obligation upon the contracting states to not punish other criminal offences, even if committed concomitantly. **This follows from an interpretation of Article 31.1 GRC in accordance with the international law on treaty interpretation.**

https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Entscheidungen/EN/2014/12/rk20141208_2bvr045011en.html

They all agree on GRC 31, without exception. They all agree that GRC 31 means that having transited through other countries on the way to the country of asylum application does not necessarily mean no right to asylum.

Alt-right propaganda REJECTED. Fuck outta here with that lying, brainwashed bullshit.

I don't agree. If I had to flee my country because of war, I would pick one that I think is safe *and* provides an opportunity at rebuilding a decent life, not just any place. Fleeing for your safety means abandoning everything you've built, and building from scratch in a foreign country is hard enough that I would think further than one day ahead while I flee.

I would also account for the fact that neighbouring countries would be overwhelmed (like Lebanon was), so spreading further is best for both these countries *and* my fellow countrymen, who would be hated as a result of being too many.

So as I flee I would think about the well being of the host countries, the future of people from my own country, and how best to fall back on my feet so I can rebuild.

Oh there's plenty of evidence that it happened but whatever, I'll let this one slide for your argument's sake.

&gt;was a reaction to Serbian actions since the start of 19th century.

First of all, the main victims of those cases were  Ottoman Turkish colonists but yes Albanian colonists came too and settled in Serbia which means that they, like the other muslims in the Balkans, oppressed the non-muslim peasants (in the case of Serbia, mostly Serbs), became rich and successful at their expense by exploiting their labour and when the uprising erupted, the peasantry responded accordingly and drove out the colonist landlords who have been oppressing them. The same happened in Greece, Romania and Bulgaria as well, with the exception of south Bulgaria (Rumelia), there you still have a few percent of ethnic Turk minority.

So no, it didn't start with the Serbian uprising as it was also a reaction to the centuries-long oppression that the non-muslim peasantry had to face with. If you really want to trace down this chain of massacres then you should start with the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. That is when it was established that those who aren't muslim are lesser people, so they have to pay more taxes and work for the muslim landlord.

&gt;Simply, Serbs pursued a campaign of ethnic cleansing since the start of your states existance.

Germany and the Dual-Monarchy shared obvious links and Britain and France had allied against them (broadly) since the Franco-Prussian wars.

1810,"What you refer to as the ""defining principles of our society and our civilization"" only really came into existence after WW2 and the atrocities of the Nazi regime.

You're completely dismissing centuries of European history in which is was considered *completely normal and expected* to put your own people and their well-being before that of others from half-way around the world. The US's first immigration law considered only ""free white people of good will"" to be naturalized and granted citizenship. Europeans fought against Muslim invasion multiple times. 

Those principles that will ultimately lead to Europeans becoming minorities in their own home continent and the countries they built into what they are today are a rather recent addition to Western civilization and in my opinion not a good one.

Fighting against racism in the sense of racial oppression and superiority is a noble cause, but this concept has been bastardized in our contemporary society to demonize any in-group preference of the European people. Almost every other racial on the other hand is afforded these freedoms in which they put their own people before others, without constantly being called racist, Nazi, \*insert ethnicity\* supremacist and other nonsense. Whites and Europeans becoming a minority is even celebrated everywhere these days, with diversity being  fetishized in a almost religious manner, while being nothing other than a euphemism for ""not white"" (see [how the UN seems to think diversity looks like - no white people](https://twitter.com/un/status/943437071317745667)).

The EU is ending bespokes deal all over Europe and Switzerland is the first country that they will target. One year, is before the exit of the UK of the single-market, which is planed for january 1st, 2021.

&gt; That would depend entirely on the (unilateral) regime Switzerland applies to immigration.

TBH I don't know enough about swiss politics to have any certainty on the matter but knowing a bit about it, I wouldn't be surprised that what happen on the French side is different that what happens on the Italian side or the german side.

It's one of the good thing about Switzerland, direct democracy. 

In any case, it's never going to be unilateral, you got to be two to dance tango. Some Swiss cantons can uniteraly refuse any deal but any agreements will involve the other side of the borders.

And considering that France, Italy and Germany are all part of the Euro-zone and Schengen Area it is very unlikely, I would rate it at 0%, that any kind of billateral agreement is done between Switzerland and any of those countries.

If the UK, worldwide 5/6th economy, Europe's third most populated country, couldn't change the rules for itself, do you really think they will change them just for Switzerland? Get real Bro ;)

Poland has become a military training ground confirming the power of populism in the West, writes Gideon Rachman, a publicist for FT.

The author is the head of the foreign section of the Financial Times. In 2016, he received the Orwell Prize for his journalism and the European Press Prize for the best commentator. 

In the text just published, he points out that Poland can once again play a key role in the history of Europe. ""The struggle between the European Commission in Brussels and the Polish government is a life trial for the European Union,"" says Rachman. 

In December, the European Commission launched Article 7 with regard to Poland, which addressed a request to the Council of the European Union (Ministers of EU member states) to state ""a clear risk of a serious breach of the rule of law by the Republic of Poland"".

The European Commission criticises the Polish authorities for the following: the degradation of the Constitutional Tribunal and the infringement of the principle of separation of powers and independence of the judiciary in the laws on the system of common courts, the National Council of the Judiciary, the Supreme Court and the National School of the Judiciary.
""populist strength test' populism test

""The battle for Poland has by chance become a test of populism - not only in Europe, but also all over the world. (....) However, those who hope that the European Union will win the decisive battle against populist authoritarianism in Poland may be disappointed,""says the Financial Times. 

According to Mr Rachman, the EU is most concerned about taking control of the judiciary and the leap in public service media. 

""State television is a poor joke, but there are still strong independent media and energetic opposition parties. However, the Polish government has already started to make life more difficult for the independent media, and is also pushing the"" reform ""of the electoral system, which raises concerns about the fairness of future elections,"" says Rachman. 
Orban went on"" go further """".

The author draws attention to the trap Europe finds itself in. ""If it does not act, it will be accused of ignoring threats to democracy and the rule of law. But by taking action, the authorities in Brussels are provoking the nationalist government to claim that foreign bureaucrats are attacking Polish sovereignty. Worse still, it is a battle that the EU can lose. Hungary, also plunging into authoritarian populism, is threatening to veto Poland. This may result in the EU being powerless, divided and incapable of defending its fundamental values,"" he notes. 

It also recalls that the closest Polish ally, Viktor Orban, has gone further in undermining the independence of the media and the judiciary, but has not been criticised so far. According to Rachman, the Union slept in Orban. To the detriment of Jaros?aw Kaczynski is also affected by the fact that unlike Fidesz his party is not in the structures of the European People's Party (it belongs to it OP). 
The case of Poland and Hungary is more important than brexit

""The compromise is perhaps already being developed. Last week, Poland reconstructed the government and removed some of the politicians regarded as' madmen' in Brussels. In Warsaw, it is said that the Polish government can make cosmetic changes in the hope that this will suffice to silence the European Commission,"" says Rachman. 

""The European Union, which already has a lot of work to do with the reform of the euro area and the brexit, may be inclined to accept any kind of conciliatory gesture on the part of Poland. But that would be a mistake. The cases of Poland and Hungary are more fundamental than brexit. They challenge the foundations of the EU as a democratic community that respects the rights of nations. If the EU now refuses to take action on Poland, the problem will return with a doubled strength,"" he notes.

The structure realised in 2014 with the founds of the italian Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT), today hosts around 60 people between men, women and childrens from the entire province.

The director of the structure after having received the goods from the soldiers, donated by the Civic Protection of Sassari and from a charity organisation of Villacidro (province of Cagliari), has pronounced words of gratitude and respect towards the italian people that continues to give a concrete help to the poor and unfortunates that today can find in the shelter a welcoming enviroment that takes care of them in every aspect, among which take center place medical assistance and education.

The support to the population is one of the activities that go alongside the main one of training and assistance to the afghan Security Forces, which is the primary focus of the mission Resolute Support, and that is realised both in a direct manner with projects identified and conducted by the national contingent, and by facilitating the distirbution of humanitarian aid coming by the national charity organisations.

The reality, however is that our 'independence' outside the EU is rapidly becoming illusionary, especially globally speaking.

In the current system, if a business isn't doing well enough, they have to close. So only the best businesses will survive (theoretically).

As an example, the amount of shitty Youtube channels/Twitch streamers without any views we would have. It's not that those people don't want to work (almost everyone does, to some extent), it's that the work they choose to do is more or less worthless, but there's nothing stopping them from doing it anyway. 

It could be argued that the will to make more money in itself would drive these people/businesses to do something else/better, but I honestly don't think that is enough in this case.

minus razing entire country to ground and killing hundreds of thousands of people... not much. 

Timur is only military commander who came close to conquering Georgia by force(technically, Russians did too, but that was politically very complicated), he took control of almost everything,including most of mountainous villages, but still failed to defeat Georgian resistance and had to offer Georgians somewhat acceptable peace terms (Timur had to recognize Christian and an 'independent' Kingdom). 

Objectively, Timur was by far the best enemy we had, he defeated us in every battle he personally led, but on the other hand, it's one of the best example what being Georgian is about, One of the greatest military commander ever,who formed one of the Greatest ever empires waged eight wars against us and still had to accept that he had no way of defeating Georgian resistance and accepted Georgia as a christian, somewhat independent Kingdom. And we are nation of 4-5 millions (highest estimate). We would rather die than abandon our way of life.

conquering Georgia was insanely hard, country is full of hills and almost everyone had military experience and skills because we never had much peace before Russians,just one enemy replacing the other.Iranians and Arabs never had much success outside of Eastern Georgia.

&gt; Likewise if I saw a white guy then they are likely not ethnically from an African country.

Yeah because ""ethnicly"" simply means that, _skin colour_; people come with less racist sounding terms like ""culture"" and ""cultural differences"" to make it sound like it's not about race but fundamentally it is.

* France uses [""metropolitan""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_France) and apparently includes nearby islands.

* The UK [apparently uses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) ""Britain"" or ""United Kingdom"" to refer to England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.  It uses ""Great Britain"" to refer to just the large island, excluding Northern Ireland.  Neither term includes nearby islands (which are possessions) *except* apparently the islet of [Rockall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockall).

* [Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark) doesn't seem to have a word for just the mainland bit (Wikipedia says ""the peninsula proper"", which I'm sure is not a standard term).  ""Denmark"" includes Greenland and the Faroe Islands.  It looks like ""the Kingdom of Denmark"" is equivalent to Denmark.

* For the Netherlands, ""the Kingdom of the Netherlands"" includes the Netherlands in Europe and the Carribbean islands.  [""Netherlands""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands) apparently refers only to the land in Europe.  This splits with the convention for Denmark.

* Spain uses the term [""peninsular""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsular_Spain) to refer to Spain on the Iberian Peninsula.  Nearby islands are not included.  I assume that [LLívia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ll%C3%ADvia) is included.

Inbreeding is even more pronounced amongst aristocratic families  who tend to stick to their own and marrying ""down"" is fairly rare throughout history.

Also even without direct ownership of land, these same families have dominated the upper levels of society, for example people with Norman names are over-represented as elite universities such as Cambridge and Oxford [link](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/universities-and-colleges/10413798/Same-names-have-attended-Oxbridge-since-the-Norman-Conquest.html).

At the other end of the class system, people have found that again there has been little mobility. For example, a study in Newcastle found that in the poor estates many of the families there can trace their origins to poor tin miners that moved from Cornwall to work in coal miners in Newcastle.

2574,"&gt;there's a different language

Fair enough, although most Americans have trouble understanding a lot of the harsher Southern accents. Although that's cheating; I'm sure you could get by with French in Switzerland or German in a number of countries. And we can go to Canada! They speak English, although a shoddy version of it.

&gt;different movies

While there are certain universal blockbusters, stuff like American Sniper or The Passion of the Christ are enormously more popular in different regions than elsewhere. You won't find indie films outside big cities, mostly, especially outside the coasts.

&gt;different songs

I'm assuming the 'different artists' is excluding musical artists, so I would point out American taste in music is very much associated with regions. Country music is almost exclusive to the Midwest and South, whereas EDM is mostly in fashion on the coasts. Rock and roll is universally popular, though punk is not popular in the more conservative areas of the country and black metal is right out among the religious nuts.

When I mean associated with regions, I mean for example no one I know where I was born and where I live now willingly listens to country. Only when I moved to the South was it popular, but they had barely any modern rock and rap was largely for African Americans. 

&gt;different artists

Outside big cities art might as well not exist. There are exceptions, but mostly popular things that everyone's seen.

&gt;different television programs

Local television is mostly dead, I'll give you that. Our nationalized stuff is mostly the same.

&gt;different newspapers

While some papers are nationally read, the biggest in any region tends to be the papers associated with the nearest city, in additional to small town papers that are generally gossip sheets/police blotters. You won't find the New York Times in the hands of a good ol' boy from the South or a rancher in Montana.

&gt;different school curriculums

You...really don't know much about the United States, do you? Up until fairly recently, the American Civil War was referred to as the War of Northern Aggression in the South. Sex education is constantly struggled over. Evolution is contested state by state. LBGT education and student groups are accepted in some states, protested in others, all but banned in the rest. Those are just the political aspects.

&gt;different foods

See above. American regions vary largely in their diet and some things you just can't find in others. I've yet to find a good chicken fried steak by me. I don't miss the deep fried moon pies, and the only good ethnic food in the South was from South America.

&gt;different history

Texas was its own Republic before it joined the USA. Much of our Southern territory was bought from France and we kept the people there. Every state that was one of the original 13 colonies had its independent founding and not all of them were English originally. Kansas was born as a battleground between pro-slavery and anti-slavery settlers. West Virginia got pissed that Virginia joined the South in the American Civil War and seceded to join the North. We stole a lot of land from Mexico and Native Americans. I really could go on, the original thirteen colonies that became the first states almost went their separate ways numerous times in the process of forming a government due to their differences. 

&gt;different religions

There is no Church of America, either. 

You mean like Jehovah's Witnesses headquartered in New York, the Church of Latter Day Saints in Utah, Pentecostalism, the Southern Baptist Convention...all of which are regional. We don't have shared religious roots, and we have even more religious movements than that!

I mean, I look upon purity pledges, quiverfull people, and Dominionists with disgust. Those are very much not near the coast.

One in six births in France is of immigrant motherhood, while only one in twelve is an immigrant - born outside France without having French nationality at birth, and has lived in France for more than a year. If immigrants contribute more to the birth rate than the native-born, it is because they are more likely to be of childbearing age and their fertility is slightly higher than the rest of the population - they have half a child per woman more on average.
**This fertility gap hardly weighs on the national average: the fertility rate in metropolitan France, which was 2.00 children on average per woman in 2010, would be almost 1.9 without immigrants.**

http://www.international-divorce.com/France-Child-Support.htm

&gt; Child support is not paid in about 10 per cent of cases and irregularly paid in another 40 per cent. The resident parent can ask the family benefits office to recover child support on their behalf after two months of non-payment. Payments can be deducted from the salary or bank account of the non-resident parent, or collected by a tax collector or bailiff. There is provision to recover a minimum maintenance amount but this measure is rarely used.

State-paid family allowances:

http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1110&amp;langId=en&amp;intPageId=4532

&gt;The amount of family allowances is adjusted depending on the number of children (from 2) and income:
&gt;
&gt;maximum amount for 2 children: €130.51
&gt;
&gt;maximum value for 3 children: €297.72
&gt;
&gt;maximum value for 4 children: €464.94.

Paper from 2002, [*A Comparison of Child Benefit Packages in 22 
Countries*](http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/73510/1/Document.pdf):

Fertility and size of child benefit package are correlated.  Excluding the outliers of Austria, New Zealand, and the US, r=0.60 for monthly benefit correlation with TFR (page 182).  At that time, France had almost the highest child care benefit.

The authors didn't try it, but doesn't look like PPP-adjusting the benefit (to account for more-expensive countries needing to pay more) would make a large improvement in correlation; Germany and France spent about the same in the 2002 paper, but Germany got a dramatically lower fertility.  I'd expect them to have had comparable PPP indexes then.

Hmm.  That does sound like there's a pretty good argument for an increased child benefit if one wants to increase TFR.

In fact, if free movement is permitted, there might be a pretty good argument for an EU-wide increased child benefit, if the only goal is to increase TFR EU-wide, as it's probably cheaper to increase fertility in poorer countries.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to start a dick measuring contest here; I've got nothing but respect for the Europeans (and Canadians and Australians) who got dragged into this mess due to our incompotence. But the fact of the matter is,  with a handful of exceptions like France and Britain, it was largely a symbolic gesture. Sending a force of a couple hundred people to guard outposts after the real fighting has stopped, or sending in support staff to rebuild infrastructure is simply *not* an equivalent experience to fighting a full-scale war. Even the British and the French have had documented issues with sustaining their own initiatives without American support, and the rest of Europe really hasn't had any large scale live experience to speak of in decades.

2799,"I live in the united states but have visited sweden annually my whole life.

No actually guys like Soros profit from instability &amp; that's why his organization, OpenEurope chooses to ""rescue"" with Boats military aged men who demonstrate to be risk taking by getting in boats &amp; illegally crossing the mediterranean. That's not to say the people that crossed the mediterranean should be blamed or that they are going to be *mostly* criminals but rather George Soros relies on this method of selection because it is most likely to find, &amp; select for, the **RARE** criminally inclined migrant as it has been proven that criminally inclined individuals are more likely to be risk takers. Again not to say that risk takers are all criminally inclined &amp; I surely might do the same thing if I was in the same situation! Again they are  NOT all bad people &amp; **the overwhelming majority ARE GREAT PEOPLE**.. Most are great! &amp; some of my best friends ATM are immigrants that got to their country by illicit means &amp; I think that it's only ethical to provide amnesty to them &amp; that deportation is unethical. 

But a welfare state is not stable or sustainable with infinite immigration. It's not rocket science. If you have a castle on the top of a hill &amp; you start giving out free bread &amp; providing living quarters to anyone who shows up.. How long before word spreads &amp; you are overwhelmed with people asking or even demanding the same kind of help!? We can only provide **so much.** A small european country can only provide *so much!* Now their citizens **are** going to have to make sacrifices that they otherwise would not have because they need more money for social services. In the immediate future that means higher taxes **less social services available for native citizens of the country &amp; immigrants *that are already there*** In the long term though it means economic regression &amp; **total collapse.** At this rate it's inevitable. 

The idea always was that a country like Sweden was more stable &amp; resistant to recessions (as well as limiting growth) but they have limits even on their stability &amp; the economic shrinkage is becoming exponential decay now &amp; it's just a matter of time before it enters a death spiral, even though their beacuratic goons pretend like they don't know exactly that. Most government types just want to keep their jobs but the top bureaucratic goons are actually hoping for disaster because they think they can ride chaos to profit like S0R0S did in Ukraine &amp; they are not tied down to any one area.. that's why they are called globalists! Unless major industrial advancements take place, Europe really is fucked &amp; even then the leaders will just try to fuck it some more! That's why **industrious people that are not in their little authoritarian club usually move ELSEWHERE!** Even south america seems to be growing more at this point or other emerging markets like Singapore or even Puerto Rico! 

And crime rates *have* been going up in correlation to the immigrant waves, but again that is not racist to say because it's obvious that only a very very very small amount of them are criminals &amp; the statistics do not lie &amp; surely it cannot be racist to talk about statistics.. In fact the global ""criminal mean"" is probably close to what it is in America. It's not racist to suppose that people who grew up in situation that was more violent could possibly have a greater proportion of people that acquired violent coping mechanisms or ptsd. Compared to America Sweden was a jewel with almost no crime but that is rapidly changing &amp; **it's approaching the global violence mean.** 

They made America look like a *shithole.* **I live in the united states but have visited sweden annually my whole life.** Sweden is becoming America tier. I have witnessed multiple violent altercations &amp; one of them was started by a swede. Swedes are becoming violent themselves, as they learn new coping skills that they would not have had to before &amp; suffer traumas. Inevitably the country will be just like America, especially **without a social safety net because the citizens refuse to form voluntary networks** of social aide instead of relying on an inept government to take of them with the false assumption rich people pay for most of it.. haha yeah right!

The Swedish government tells the citizens to submit to attackers &amp; it's illegal to fight back or even defend yourself in the slightest way! I know someone that did a year in prison for defending himself from muggers (i wont say what race or if they were immigrants) &amp; **when he was with WOMEN.** In Sweden women are taught to let men rape them &amp; would actually face prison time if they fought back. It really is worse than Trump said, although not nearly as much about individual immigrants who are often great people but more about a corrupt &amp; disaster seeking, almost suicidal, bureaucracy. Swedes try to downplay it but some are honest but I visit there many times a year &amp; know firsthand. 

Firearms would prevent this kind of tyranny coming from the government! Firearms are the most basic forms of defense **&amp; have been demonstrated to lower crime with increased ownership** among the population of some communities. Guns help if the community has any cohesion at all. The latest church shooting in texas was stopped by a civilian with a gun! &amp; the **prime reason for gun deaths in America is gang violence &amp; black market surrounding drugs**. Governments promote gangs and drugs. Ask yourself why is heroin cheaper than ever after we saw pictures of American troops guarding poppy fields &amp; Hamid Karzai's (president of afghanistan) brother was caught trafficking heroin. Coincidence? Look up Freeway Rick Ross... He has **direct** evidence the CIA sold Crack in Compton, Los Angeles, California.

Then there is the whole Barry Seals thing &amp; the CIA rendition (torture) aircraft that crashed full of cocaine. **This is all by design! It's exactly why centralized authority cant be fucking trusted with any money!** End the welfare state &amp; come up with a way to provide a social safety net voluntarily &amp; in a decentralized manner where people can **see the money they donate affecting their communities.**  Leftists are literally the biggest advocates for **empire**!

I know people that grew up in ""white trash"" trailer parks in the USA who suffered violence &amp; these people, as nice as they are, are the kinds of people that are used to violence &amp; know how to cope with it *in violent ways.* Swedes usually were raised in safe, *privileged* environments. **I'm not saying immigrants are like this** but if even some of the white people I knew went there it would be like a **""wolf in the sheep's pen.** I would never ever advocate for white Americans to move to places like Sweden! Because I know they would irrevocably change it for the worse!

The problem is that even a relatively small amount of criminally averse people can vastly change what used to be a Utopia like Sweden. I doubt immigrants would have much effect on America because it's *approaching* the global mean of violence but, again, I would never advocate for massive waves of Americans coming to Europe! **Tbh I am not a big fan of inviting more MEN to the party!** As a man myself I like it better when there are more women around! That is just a fact.  Most of the immigrants coming to Europe now are men (80 percent) &amp; that can adversely affect the *pole to hole ratio*! It's ok 4 people 2 have dating biases. That is not racist and it's not prejudice to say that I want less men, overall, in my country. **If it was ethical I would deport millions of Swedish men from the country so I would have a better time dating Swedish women.** Also, Muslim women are not likely to date European men because their families won't usually let them. 

Anyway you can get Soro's playbook by researching his actions during the Ukraine uprising. Also that's not free market libertarian capitalism but rather authoritarian globalist chaos instigating crony capitalism. It's absolutely 100 percent true that there are factions of ""elite"" authoritarians that manipulate their powers in a way that causes instability in Europe &amp; America. They think they can ride the wave of chaos to benefit themselves. In fact the Rothschilds infamously profited massively from *both* world wars &amp; a lot of people think they helped/encouraged Hitler's rise to power. 

Because a few Jewish people do something bad that doesn't mean all Jewish people are bad ofc. **Their race and religeon has nothing to do with it and same goes with immigrant violence.** There are just as many elite mischief makers that are protestant. Ironically and hypocritically these bad actors like Merkel will use **hate speech laws is a way for them to terrorize the citizenry.**

And **immigrants that gain voting rights are more likely to vote for parties that support more immigration specifically because of tribalist instincts** (foolishly because instability doesn't help them anymore than it helps native euros) which is a **total positive feedback loop!** They have created a situation where the more immigrants that come in the easier it is to get more immigrants to come in! I don't hate them as individuals AT ALL but anyone with half a brain can see how this self perpetuating chain of events can become a ""runaway train"" with no brakes to stop a possible derailment!

2838,"&gt;you

More like they. I'm Polish, not Russian.

It isn't de jure part of Ukraine. There wasn't a consolidated power which might form the kingdom which then could make some lands de jure to it. It is quite of an old concept, but it is reflected in our country's borders like for example Polish-Czech border on the Ziemia Klodzka. The only reason it is shaped like this, is the old de jure princedom of it. 

Again this concept shaped the regions throughout centuries, and is still of importance. So, no. Crimea is absolutely not de jure part of Ukraine in any sense. It would be de jure if you claimed the Horne and Dolne Luzice for yourself (it is obviously not reasonable right now, just saying), but not for Ukraine to claim Crimea.

&gt;Crimean Khanate

It was wiped out by the Russians, which is sad, but we cannot undo it. If we want to call it a Russian occupation, we should at least admit it was occupied by the Ukrainians beforehand. 

&gt; it would be best if you left the peninsula alone

Perhaps yes, but there cannot be a vacuum power in the politics, aspecially in regards to the land possesions. Simply impossible. 

The title is provocative, and untrue to conclude. There is no occupation, or if there is the Russians of Crimea support it. It's all anti-Russian rhetoric, which then creates the anti-western rhetoric in Russia. For what.

2865,"&gt; Crimea was once part of Crimean Khanate, and has no connections to Russia before you conquered it in the past

This is factually untrue. Russians first came to Crimea in the mid-10th century ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Crimea#Rus'_and_Byzantium)).

Crimean Khanate was formed only in the early 15th century ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Crimea#Crimean_Khanate_(1441–1783)).

Fun fact:
&gt; Crimean Tatars introduced [raids into Ukrainian lands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean%E2%80%93Nogai_raids_into_East_Slavic_lands), in which they captured slaves for on-sale. For example, from 1450 to 1586, eighty-six Tatar raids were recorded, and from 1600 to 1647, seventy. In the 1570s close to 20,000 slaves a year went on sale in Kaffa.
&gt; Slaves and freedmen formed approximately 75% of the Crimean population.  In 1769 a last major Tatar raid, which took place during the Russo-Turkish War, saw the capture of 20,000 slaves.

Well yeah. The reality is that men are just better for combat roles, so obviously they will be preferred. Given that there is no shortage of young men, combat roles are very easily filled. Supportive infrastructure is already in place and makes better use of men as well - women aren't going to be as good at digging trenches, doing heavy lifting in the warehouse and other heavy labor duties. 

You are just living in your idealized egalitarian dream and totally out of touch with real world practical limitations. What do you propose? Instead of taking 100 male soldiers, should they take 50 men and 50 women? The women obviously won't be carrying 50kg worth of combat gear, lifting artillery shells and felled lumber for trenches, so what will they be doing? Administrative stuff?

2959,"Anecdotal evidence here, but my great grandfather (who I knew) lived in Transylvania and was about 20 around the time of Trianon. He spoke perfect Hungarian, but was Romanian. Why? Because he had to go to a Hungarian school. Absolutely everything he learned was in Hungarian, to the point that when he spoke German or Romanian he screwed up names of famous people because he only knew the Hungarian version of them. He resented the fact that he was forced to speak Hungarian, and that the entirety of his professional life was predicated on his essentially pretending to be Magyar.

As a result that man had a chip on his shoulder you wouldn't believe when it came to Magyarization - as did other (completely disparate, and in fact Slovak) branches of my family from that time. Do you think that this hatred was due to nationalism, or that it was a reaction to the oppression each (again, I have to stress, completely separate) non-Magyar branch of my family endured? 

I don't want to sing the song of *boo hoo* victimhood here - all of that happened a long time ago, and I certainly don't hold a grudge about it - but I think it's important to be honest. Magyarization was a thing, and oppression of non-Magyars was also a thing. That was the foremost reason why all those different nations wanted to break away from Hungarian rule.

As a result less fuel is needed, making the technique cheaper and greener.

I don’t know who to believe but it does seem a bit backwards to go back to burning more fuel and dragging nets across the sea floor. I also get the feeling that it’s more a political decision than one based on researched facts. But my news was probably pretty biased, haha.

As I already mentioned, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. However strictly from an architectural design standpoint it makes little sense: the top floors don't do anything but bring more shade to the lower ones (not particularly useful in a ""sunny"" city like Rotterdam), and the towers are way too close together, which creates wind tunnels, and you guessed it, blocks out light. 

The sunlight issue still stands for the building on the left, which should really have the incline the other way around.

3062,"&gt; Isn't Estonia the country with the biggest gender gap in wages in the EU? 

It is, and it's a problem. It seems to be systematic because it's largely caused by women picking lower-paying jobs and several surveys have shown women's expectations for remuneration to be lower from men's by largely as much as the wage gap is. 

However, I don't it's directly related to having children. I mean, if child benefits are relatively high but wage lags behind men, wouldn't having children rather not feel that threatening to your income? Also, as parental leave is a generous 3 years *and* you usually can't lay off pregnant women, and there are restrictions to laying off mothers of young children, I don't see why children would threaten their career, at least more so than in other countries.

Also, as I said, Nordics do not do that much better with their birth rate, it's immigration that's mostly growing their population.

3216,"It's hardly a mental breakdown, and I'm bemused that this article could be written by a Cambridge don.

The Scottish indyref very much asked the excellent question ""is there any reason why Scotland should not be a full voting member of the EU Single Market and Customs Union, just like tiny Malta or Cyprus?""

The unionist political class utterly floundered on this question, because they have the greatest difficulty articulating any convincing conception of something that so many people hold fundamental to their identity: nationhood. And they have particular difficulty doing this not in relation to the European Project (an argument that would only boost the SNP's position).

The Yes campaign failed pretty much because the UK was *not* fully integrated into the EU: it maintained its own currency. If the UK had adopted the euro then there would have been no 'currency question' for Salmond to crumble under. 

For many people except the victorious elite (the votes are in? Good. Tick. Done. Now onto English Votes for English Laws.) this was all a bit concerning. Is there still a purpose for this union of four nations? Or should we disband and separately join the union of 27 other nations? 

The 2015 General Election manifested that concern, in that a late swing away from a likely Labour-led coalition was affected by concerns that Miliband would be in the SNP's pocket. 

Then the following year Leave made the case that the UK is big enough to have an economy of scale, small enough to be agile, and could have a purpose worth Taking Back Control for. Remain, on the other hand, said 'although things might be getting shitter and the country falling apart, unless we stay on the same course things will get shitter and the country will fall apart.'

Brexit is fundamentally an attempt to test whether or not the UK-as-a-union can find a purpose again, or whether it should just disband like ageing rock stars that have had their time.

Many people were happy and proud because it seemed that the SPD   finally showed integrity again.
Then it was all thrown out and they started talks about coalition talks. The results show almost no influence by the SPD and have almost none of their main points in it.
And they are proud of it and talk it up as the best thing.

3272,"I don't really know about current Russian alcohol drinking habits, but ""liter of alcohol per capita per year"" is a stat that can very easily be abused to say something it didn't mean.

Eg in France it is heavily influenced by the fact that wine is very accepted ""food"" drink; eg people will often drink a glass of wine with their meal, even on working day with collegues, several times a week. Go to a restaurant, and the majority of food/drink/dessert menu will include a glass of wine in the drinks choice.

That makes the stat much higher per capita, but it's obviously much less of an issue than drinking half the total yearly amount but in a few localized binge drinking hard liquor event, rather than a little every day.

So, that stat alone doesn't tell us much about whether there is less russian drinking but they still heavily abuse it, or if they all still drink like before but they abuse it much less.

No it isn't. 'America' is a shortened version of 'United States of America' so it's a valid term. 'England' appears nowhere in the name of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and so it's not a valid descriptor of the UK, which is why no Brit would call their country 'England' (obviously they would call themself English if they are from England, but they wouldn't try to conflate Scotland and Wales with England like Americans do).

1. Even *if* vlachs are the present day Romanians and *if* they lived in the area, there was no Romania as a country,  a legal entity, or as a concept at all -hence nothing to take *back*. By this token Hungarians could take back a lot of territory in the Urals.

2. The Carpatian Basin has pretty good studies of 8-10 century populations. Avars, Slavs, Saxons... a lot of people. there is absolutely nothing that would point to an uniform ""vlach"" populated area anywhere.

wealth - The Turks have been in the country for 150 years, constant wars destroyed wealth, and prevented capitalization. It is hardly our fault that Austrians became richer than us by the XVIIth century.

&gt; infrastructure

We were building it as fast as we could, most of it on minority territories, as I pointed out in earlier comments.

&gt; literacy rates

The literacy rate of Romanians in the Kingdom of Hungary was still higher than in the Kingdom of Romania.

&gt; minority rights

As you can see the minority rights were quite wide in the Kingdom of Hungary. i am not familiar with Austrian laws in the same era, but I seriously doubt Austrians gave more rights to their minorities than us.

&gt; It one thing you can't govern and develop yourselves, but you dragged whole innocent nations through this shithole called Kingdom of Hungary.

How so?

&gt; Magyarisation is a despicable crime.

While it really was a despicable thing, the measure of magyarization  is overstated. As you see, the usage of minority languages were guaranteed by laws, and there were ample minority language schools, before 1880 anyway.

&gt; Shame it didn't come some centuries earlier.

You are making the false assumptions, that ethnic tensions were prevalent before the XIXth century. This is not true, in the Kingdom of Hungary before the emergence of nationalism it didn't matter which language was your mother tongue, it was your social standing which determined the range of your opportunities. We had a ton of Slavic palatines, and a quarter-Romanian king.

Literally in the first two comments they said that one was referring to the county and the other to the city. They did discuss about who was allowed to live in the cities in the following comments.

&gt;  Hungarians were oppressing us, so serves them right what's happening to them, and they should just shut up

What is happening to them? I think the discussion might be that Hungarians are not as innocent as they might let people to believe and not that there is any justification for any kind of oppression, if there is any, today.

&gt; So you agree that your countrymen are NOT very interested in accurate history after all?

No, I don't agree with it. I said we moved on and most of our sources are external now.

&gt; Sure thing. As soon as your country treats its minorities like an European country should, and your (now) ex-PM does not threaten with violence, I will.

The press, us all already forgot about that statement. You ask why? Because we know about the political intricancy and what our former prime minister is. He didn't meant what you think he meant. He is a hillbilly that uses phrases like that to make a statement but doesn't mean them in the literal way. That is why it was not a big deal in Romania.

&gt; So you agree that your countrymen are NOT very interested in accurate history after all? So where does it leave us with them spewing historically inaccurate statements to justify the oppression of Hungarian minorities?

Please, please!!! Visit Harghita, Covasna, Mures, Cluj. I will come with you so you can point me where the oppression is. Why do Hungarians think we are oppressing our minorities ? Also sources please.

I am from Brasov and I live near side Hungarians ethnic from nearby counties and never have they told me they feel oppressed aside from the autonomy jokes we did on them.

Also, reread your comment and see how biased you are towards believe everything you read in Hungarian sources.

&gt; By the way what would you say if I said about today's Transylvania that ""Romanian-ruled Transylvania""?

&gt; In the 80s we did smuggle in clothes, books and food for people in Kolozsvar in Romanian-ruled Transylvania, I have you know.

Got to be honest, I don't know what that means.



What do you think about your prim-minister, ministers, political figures coming to Romania every year to hold a speech about how the future of Transylvania is in Hungarian?

3504,"&gt; They are not deciding anything it is a mental condition called Gender dysphoria and changing gender is the treatment for it. You are welcome to find a better treatment if you don't find the treatment sufficient and it is the doctors who decide whether the kid's gender dysphoria bad enough to require sex change treatment.

The thing is, is it really a good treatment for it? Of course at first it does handle the issues the person has, but further down the line new issues then pop up.

Like the 20 times more higher suicide rate and new mental difficulties starting about 10 years after transition.

It's often said that gender is not equal to sex, but that does not mean that sex is not part of gender. For example if we image that they are 20 at the time of transitioning that would mean 30 when the new issues pop up. The perfect time for people to think about raising children. Which is simply not possible (unless they adopt children) with the current treatment.

Now, suicide is not my problem, it's their life and i do consider it their right to decide on that. And all is fair when they can make an educated decision on the advantages and disadvantages that transitioning entails. But surgery is not a magic fix-it-all solution.

And the criminal statistics do point to the same conclusion, as MtF transitioned people commit crimes at the same rate as the average male population even though it should be lower (like in the female population).

So it all points to the conclusion that surgery alleviates the symptoms only for a while, but does not fix the issues.

Bonus idea i had a while ago, transgender people often feel like (for a lack of a better word) oppressed or disliked. I wonder if it can have something to do the so called Uncanny Valley encountered with artificial representations of people. They human brain really hates when things (like people) don't act according to their expectations. So computer generated people who look nearly identical to normal humans but don't exhibit the same reactions or motions as expected, are automatically disliked. What if it's the same reaction with people who have transitioned? If a person looks like a female but exhibits male traits, would that also subconsciously put a dislike tag on them?",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7qk274/the_annual_number_of_referrals_to_the_gender/dsr74os/,Alcobob,1516088707

3517,"&gt; I don't get this dispute at all. The argead dynasty wasn't Slavic but not Hellenic either. They were considered Hellenic/""Greek"" later. Macedons counted as barbarians before that. And Macedons were proud to be Macedon and to be different than Hellenic people.

What? Where do you get your history from? 

*Alexander the Great addressing his troops:*

&gt;Our enemies are Medes and Persians, men who for centuries have lived soft and luxurious lives; we of Macedon for generations past have been trained in the hard school of danger and war. Above all, we are free men, and they are slaves. There are Greek troops, to be sure, in Persian service — but how different is their cause from ours! They will be fighting for pay — and not much of at that; **we, on the contrary, shall fight for Greece, and our hearts will be in it.**

*Alexander's letter to Darius III:*

&gt;Your ancestors came to Macedonia **and the rest of Hellas** [Greece] and did us great harm, though we had done them no prior injury. I have been appointed **leader of the Greeks**, and wanting to punish the Persians I have come to Asia, which I took from you.

*From the Pseudo-Callisthenes record:*

&gt;**Youths of the Pellaians and of the Macedonians and of the Hellenic Amphictiony and of the Lakedaimonians and of the Corinthians… and of all the Hellenic peoples**, join your fellow-soldiers and entrust yourselves to me, so that we can move against the barbarians and liberate **ourselves** from the Persian bondage, **for as Greeks** we should not be slaves to barbarians.

Georgian healthcare isn't public. That says it all. Some doctors are super good. Maany suck. And you need to know the decent ones and be prepared to pay quite a bit. And we have good doctors in almost every direction of medicine. So if you have that knowledge you are good, if not... Good luck.

3602,"&gt; he paints it as a new totalitarian move

Talk about being biased here. I don't see him painting it as anything. He merely lists what they have done.

&gt; Hartz IV was a mess because it came from the SPD

Hartv IV would be a big mess either way. 

&gt; Again, I don't support it but considering the political parties that got the votes it does make sense. 

I don't really see your point here. Let's say (hypothetically speaking) Golden Dawn got the absolute majority in Greece (not to directly equate them with your government), would you in that case also just say: ""Yeah, it makes sense, that they would mold Greece much like the 3rd Reich, that's what they said they would do.""

Of course stuff like your current government is doing is to be expected from your current government but it's still noteworthy and a pretty big move. You could shrug all critique of with ""yeah, that was to be expected"", doesn't make it any better.

&gt; But we are talking about Austrian politics, and shit went down in a different way. 2015 ruined an already declining SPÖ. 

Oh trust me, the SPD would dream about doing as well as the SPÖ currently.

If you would have refuted any of his claims, I would have done research but it seems like you actually do agree that what he says is more or less true but you merely disagree with some kind of implicit framing that you see because you assume he is a green voter.

Their methodology is also flawed in that it is measuring ""cultural diversity"" by the number of languages spoken. 

From the wiki page: ""This index of cultural diversity is biased towards linguistic variations as opposed to genetic diversity and other variations.""

It doesn't take a genius to know that you can have very different cultures and subcultures that happen to have populations speaking a common language. Take three Spanish speakers: one from Spain, the Philippines, and Colombia. Are they culturally the same? Fuck no they aren't, but according to the methodology used they are. The methodology is also biased toward countries whose primary language is the lingua franca. We get a million immigrants annually but according to your source, these are ""less culturally diverse"" because they, like most of the people in the country that they are immigrating to, speak English. Having literally any other language as your primary language would inflate the ""cultural diversity"".

edit: I should say ALMOST any other language, because Spanish, Mandarin, etc are common as well. My main point though is that there is an inverse relationship between the number of international speakers of a country's primary language and the cultural diversity metric in their methodology.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7qklcg/spain_is_set_to_replace_the_us_as_the_worlds/dsr4lvl/,Genorb,1516083885

On top of that Stalin was a very paranoid man and did everything just to be sure to stay on power resulting in deaths of millions.

Communism was not supposed to be authoritarian, the contrary, it was supposed to have no government at all. But that was quite impossible to achieve with revolutions, not to say governmentless communism is hard to create in general. So you get one man, the leader of the revolution to dictate everything and with an opposition that could kill him. And that results in authoritarianism with ""communism"" used as a tool for obedience.

Fascism on other hand, is inherently authoritarian, and supports the theory of one ""race"" being superior to others and so it has the ""right"" to do with the inferiors anything it wants.

&gt;unemployment

Unemployment is mostly cyclical and has always existed.

&gt;stagnant wages

Wages in certain European countries have been slow/stagnant to grow Post-2008, which to a degree is understandable given the severity of the crash. Long term however wages continue to grow.

&gt;mass marketing manipulation

Propaganda has existed since time immemorial in every possible system of Governance and organisation of the Economy

&gt;rampant inflation

What..? Inflation is actually too low in several countries at the moment. We're not in Venezuela 

&gt;unaffordable house prices

True, housing prices are rising at a rate higher than wage growth. Although I'm skeptical you support scaling back zoning laws, which is one of the few ways to truly combat it 

&gt;indifferent political elite

First of all a vague, meaningless term, and once again, not at all unique to the ""Neoliberal Capitalist"" system.

&gt;One cannot argue that a perversion of an idea is thus the nucleus and sole interpretation of that idea

I didn't give a single and sole interpretation. I talked about Communism in the USSR, which consists of 15 Soviet Republics, and the Warsaw Pact, hosting 6 members excluding the Soviet Union. There's also Yugoslavia under Tito, Maoist China, Cambodia under Pol Pot and Ethiopia under the Derg. And honestly, that's just the examples I remember that were *notably* pseudo-Genocidal or oppressive. I could mention India's stagnation under the Licence Raj if need be.


You're right, a single perversion of an ideology is not the basis for good-faith debate of it. But you cannot define an ideology as ""society is perfect"" and then when *multiple* attempts at implementation fail, and lead to a society only more oppressive than that which came before, act as if your negative perception is entirely unfounded ",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/7qicb1/on_this_day_99_years_ago_rosa_luxemburg_was/dsqzhr8/,Blackfire853,1516076202

3801,"First, you need to be aware that Russia has historically used ""we feel threatened and want some buffer space"" as a justification to take over neighbors.  Ask the Estonians or Finns in World War II, where she made the same claim.  So if you find the idea that it should be okay for Russia to annex her neighbors because she says that she needs buffer space to be compelling, then you need to understand that this logic entails ceding a number of countries to her.

Second, this isn't World War II any more.  Yeah, for Napoleon or Hitler, supply line length was significant.  Any conventional war Russia has with NATO involves Russia rapidly losing an air war.  Aircraft can zip across this space in very little time.  Let's pretend that Russia seizing parts of Ukraine was actually done because Russia wanted defense (ignoring the inherent contradictions in defending yourself from a supposed western threat by kicking off a war).  You're talking about, what, 100 miles of Ukraine?  That's five minutes of flight time for an F-35.

Third, any existential threat involving invasion would — at least according to Russia — involve nuclear escallation anyway.

Fourth, if Russia would like to feel secure, what about other countries?  Sure, Nazi Germany invaded her — after she took parts or all of Finland, the Baltic countries, Poland…what right does she have to make *them* need to be her buffer?  If she claims the right by virtue of being a major military power, one would point out that NATO is considerably stronger than her — and, for that matter, is hardly structured offensively.

Fifth, Russia is the largest country in the world.  If she fears attack against a strategic asset in her west, then she has a very simple, safe, and peaceful way to buy that resource a hundred mile buffer — place it 100 miles further east, moving into her interior.  We do exactly that with our ICBM silos to avoid Russian subs — we don't seize all Russian subs to provide us with ""buffer space"".",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7qmc8b/why_not_integrate_russia_into_eu_instead_of/dsqrmv4/,vokegaf,1516067101

3803,"* The oldest Caucasoid skull was found there, which is why the race that Europeans, MENAs, [most] South Asians, and [some] Central Asians belong to is called 'Caucasoid'.

* Their languages, known as Kartvelian, can be divided into Svan, Zan, and Kartli. Kartli is Georgia's national language. Laz is the variety of Zan that is spoken in a Turkish province (Artvin). The Kartvelian languages are a distinct language family.

* Some of Northeast Turkey and I think the Lori province of Armenia used to be Kartvelian/Georgian before.

* Joseph Stalin (whose original name was Joseph Jughashvili) and Lavrenty Beria (head of the secret police) were from there. Stalin was a murderous behemoth that killed several thousands of Soviets in purges and his economic policy of collectivization led to the death of millions, largely peasants, but it didn't bother him because it helped in forming his Bolshevik dreamland. He was a close comrade of Lenin originally (who Lenin eventually tried to replace with Trotsky) and then became his successor. Stalin eventually died of a stroke. Khrushchev (Stalin's successor) had Beria executed.

* Used to be part of the Soviet Union and Tranacaucasian Federation.

* Large swathes of Georgia were conquered by Iranians and others for centuries, but Georgia was never fully conquered by anyone and they voluntarily became part of the Russian Empire.

* They call their country *Sakartvelo*, which is named after the Kartli region of Georgia.

* Ingiloys are Muslim Georgians that live in Azerbaijan and have largely assimilated.

* Batsbis and Kists are Chechen sub-groups living in Georgia. I think the former are native whereas the latter are not.

* George XI of Kartli (Gurgin Khan) was a Georgian crypto-Christian that served as ruler of the Kandahar region when most of Georgia and Afghanistan were part of the Safavid Empire. He was assassinated by Mirwais Hotak (an Afghan/Pashtun) who was a rebel that later went to conquer large parts of Persia for a short while.

* English/European name comes from Saint George.

* In the ~~19th or 20th~~ late 17th century, a Frenchman that was visiting Georgia described it as culturally Persian. Historically, their only cultural contact with Europeans was with Russians and to a lesser extent Greeks.

* Names end in -ishvili and -dze. One suffix is used in the eastern part and the other in the western part.

* Abkhaz is not the original name of the people that live there. Their original name is *Apsua* and they were a Circassian tribe.

* All of Abkhazia and South Ossetia (Samachablo) were originally Georgian majority if we go back far enough (though I could be mistaken on Abkhazia).

* The English and Russian name *Ossetia* comes from the Georgian name for the region *Osseti*, which is *Oss* (ethnicity name) + -*eti*. The *-eti* is a Georgian place name suffix. The Osses are of Sarmatian descent.

* Capital is Tblisi.

* Abkhazia and South Ossetia are regions Georgia lost in a war because of Russian interference. Georgia despises Russia for that.

* They have an autonomous region called Adjara which used to be Muslim majority, but became Christian majority because of strong pressure on the people there to convert after communism ended.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7qm2ur/what_do_you_know_about_georgia/dsqromb/,UnbiasedPashtun,1516067155

I don't see how that is relevant to the point; you said reversing choice is rare and I said it isn't.

This is basically a no true Scotsman argument of ""But those who reversed weren't really trans!"" well maybe they aren't but that's not of much use until you come with a way to differentiate them _before_ the reversal happens as a way to decide whom to give the blockers to.

3811,"As a Russian this is the reason why I come to /r/Europe from time to time - to savour this unmistakable salty bitterness of the angry Europeans I've never met hating on me and all of my ancestors. To be honest, that's quite a sobering thing to experience, a reality-check of sorts. As a person in my 30's I wasn't aware that being born Russian makes you in part responsible for all the crimes and mistakes committed during both Imperial and Soviet periods of our history. 

However, despite the vague sense of uneasiness, these not-so-friendly comments also give a rare opportunity to glimpse into this dark and nasty part of the European collective consciousness, one that compels people to simultaneously abhor, disdain and fear Russia. It's also very impressive how this metal technique is able to sustain itself through time and space - I saw young students studying in the West with no experience of living under the Soviet rule, and yet a few of them were clearly showing that similar attitude of ""loathing of all things Russian"". 

Thе prevalence and the level of magnitude of this racially motivated antipathy differs from person to person - the attitude of an average EU citizen is often neutral or sometimes even cautiously friendly; on the other hand, there are certain demographics (especially in particular countries) that are known for their passionate, all-consuming and unwavering hatred towards Russia. For centuries this animosity was diligently nursed bigger and stronger, developed in secret and carefully shared it finally flourished into almost an ideology, becoming an integral part of the diplomatic and political agenda for many decades to come. They take it so seriously that there is no doubt they'll carry this legacy well into the next century. 

The conclusion here is rather mundane: the best strategy for Russia is to normalize the relations and then try to keep them friendly and mutually beneficial, however there should be an understanding that due to historical realities, national grievances and a plethora of other factors there will always be an angry minority hell-bent on hating Russia, going out of their way to thwart its development and try to hamper its achievements. Their hate is mostly unreasonable and groundless, they don't hate us for doing something wrong, they simply hate us for who we are.

3814,"&gt; And no, putting refugees and migrants in barracks isn't the same as gassing jews

Gassing Jews is not necesarilly imperative for being a national socialist. Above all it's an ideology seemingly combining nationalism with socialism (at least that's the claim; for the third reich nazis sozialism never actually played a huge role, only in campaigning). The FPÖ is for instance the #1 workers party in Austria (they got over 50 % in that group) and now they actively fuck them over (which to be fair was evident enough from the beginning). They are not as bad as the FN, which I'd call modern day nazis without hesistation (they truly got the entire package) but there are too many allusions to completely ignore them. 

So are the FPÖ nazis? Some of them almost certainly, some others are probably more right-wing liberal (in the european sense, not the American sense), as a party collectively I don't know what describes them best but that the question itself is relevant is concerning. They are by my estimation significantly closer to nazism than the AfD in Germany for instance but the AfD is currently moving the goalposts...

The thing is: I don't like the way people use nazi. It's usually meant only to bring someone or something in connection to the holocaust. That's purely a political smearing campaign. But I do still think that national socialism as an ideology is not unfit to describe certain political developments in Europe today (like for instance the FN).

I only read half of it, since it is too long, but what the text basically says:

Companies/people tend to produce stuff, most people would eat/use. So what´s the problem in that? What is the big negative thing you would get, if your beef would be halal? There is nothing negtaive about it for any christian. Also the text (as far as I read) doesn´t imply that (for example) pork suddenly disappears. This is basic economics. I don´t´understand why you are even making a subject out of this. If Germans do that on their own, then it is their decition and not a forced decition by a minority. 

In addition to that, the ""sample number for this theory"" is way too small. This means statistically speaking nothing. I live in a city with 1/3 of the population beeing foreigners and 1/10 turks alone. For decades this is the case now. Yet the city is not even close to offer halal meet everywhere.

I never made any specific claims about his statements, I genuinly don't know whether he is right or wrong but just claiming they are heavily biased without evidence isn't convincing at all? Aber natürlich wäre das dir nicht eingefallen Mr. Joker (oder darf ich Violet sagen)?

&gt; Is about child support that leaves Austria. Bunch of Kids that live from Austrian Child support are not in Austria. I don't mind and I think it makes sense, OP still left out so much information that he was essentially lying. 

What about the tax cuts to the disadvantage of people with low wages and single parents? Apart from that calling it ""Changing child-related subsidies"" is not ""essentially lying"", he's just not being specific. They did change child related subsidies as you just told me.

&gt; That's nothing new either. Every new government did and does that

Ehhhh... so you're telling me in this case it's neither wrong nor heavily biased? 

&gt; Don't even know where he wants to go here. The new right coalition wants to somewhat (nothing significant) relax immigration laws. 

Again I'm assuming his claim is true from your description.

&gt; Most of these issues are none issues, and I say that as someone that would never vote for either of the two parties. It is simply the very same crying from their ivory-tower that crippled Austrias left, and it seems like they refuse to learn. 

Well, taxonomically he listed them pretty well, Hart IV (which he listed first) in Germany basicly led to the formation of an entirely new party (or at least the full package that came with Hartz IV known as Agenda 2010) and initiated the full-on decline of the SPD (popularizing the well known Slogan ""Wer hat uns verraten""). It's perhaps the single largest political dealbreaker in German politics this century so far. Rent in Germany is likewise one of the biggest actual political topics there is and it affects peoples lives in a very direct way. If this is crying from an Ivory-tower, then what isn't? 

Edit: if you issue is with the greens in Austria or identity politics I don't like that either but a lot of what he pointed out were real issues as far as I'm concerned.

Sorry but that's stretching the facts to breaking point. Pan-slavism, language connection (Russian I believe is as widely spoken as German if not moreso in most West Slavic countries), huge cultural similarities, economic similarities, etc etc. And most obviously in political terms, you share a recent history of Communism and a current politics of ultra-conservatism, white supremacism and anti-democracy that is utterly alien to Western Europe.

Also this may be a linguistic difference, but in English we wouldn't really class Russia as Eastern Europe, Russia is Russia. Eastern Europe is anywhere that speaks a Slavic language that is not Russian (plus Hungary and Romania). That may be an inaccurate characterisation to people who live there, but I'm afraid every region has to put up with the geographical misconceptions by other regions when it comes to the correct use of language.

4092,"I love the country and the people there! They are so kind and inviting, like I've never seen before! 

And the nature is beautiful there, the sapperari wine tastes great and drinking with the Georgians is a lot of fun. You're taking turns on toasts until you can stand or speak properly anymore and the food is the very best I've ever eaten! I love khinkali (dumplings filled with soup and meat) and their cheesebread (forgot the name). If you like to eat on your vacation, Georgia is the place to go. And they serve a lot! Also give cha-cha a try if you like liquor. 

It was in Georgia where archeologists found the first traces of wine agriculture. However Georgia and Armenia still fight over who invented it. 

Georgia has incredible gold treasures from ancient times. The metalwork is so fine and detailed, modern goldsmiths struggle to recreate it. 

There are many abandoned castles, watchtowers, churches and monasteries that you can visit. 

Tiflis is the capital and has quite a beautiful old town. However it's overrun by tourists and the streets are full and dangerous to cross. I think most tourists are from Turkey or Russia and you can hear russian pop songs on many corners. 

There are many stray animals on the streets, but they seem harmless. You can eat on the outside and feed the occasional passing cat. 

Georgians are incredibly proud of their country and their culture. 

Primary religion is georgian-orthodox, IIRC. Many Georgians believe in god and go to church. However many churches are in disrepair and need assistance. 

One of the most popular historical people in Georgia is the holy Nino, which is why so many georgian women have that name. 

Part of Georgia is occupied by russian puppet states. People that live along the borders are constantly harassed and I think there have been arrests of farmers who were accused of crossing the border. 

Georgia has great mountains, great for hiking. I can reconmend you a good german-speaking tourguide if you like. He offers culture as well as adventure trips and will invite you in his mountain village high in the Caucasus.

They have a lot of watermelons. Come in the right time of the year and you will see watermelons everywhere. Huge ones at that, and again, they taste fantastic! You can often buy them on the side of the road. 

They have a unique alphabet and their language is one of the oldest in the world that is still widely in use. 

If you feel sick, drink Borjomy water. It's a kind of wellness water that is supposed to cure sickness and be healthy in general. I can confirm that it's been a help in my travels.

4105,"Rarely assimilation. The majority were killed in the holocaust - 2/3 of the Jewish population of Europe. The country my family were from had 92% of the population murdered. The lowest rates were in Denmark (where the entire population barring a few thousand fled to Denmark) or countries like France, where foreign Jews were the primary victims and ‘only’ 1/3 or so of the population were killed. This affected every community on the list except London and Baku.

However a lot of the starting population is pre-war and a lot of people were migrating in this time. If it was pre-1910s, then the U.K. in particular and pre-1920s then America. Many fled pogroms and antisemitism (particular in 1903-1905 and during the Russian civil war). They went everywhere; Argentina, South Africa, Mexico, Ireland, wherever. 

Fleeing the holocaust was the other big migration. There’d been migration from Europe to Israel and the Americas already. The US had closed off a lot of the emigration, and more were leaving to Israel even before WW2. In the lead up and during the Holocaust, Jews fled to Japan, the Domican Republic, etc but that was a very small number to be fair. Most emigration came afterwards. I had family who practically walked across Europe to get to the displaced persons camps. People lived in DP camps for years and years, and were resettled largely in Israel (after its independence), but also in America and some to a variety of countries they had links to via family or where there were small resettlement schemes. 

The ones who didn’t flee or get killed, left for other reasons too. During WW2, just prior to the Nazi invasion of the USSR, there was mass deportation of people living in the area stalin had invaded - poles, minorities, Latvians, etc, and Jews were over represented. They went to Siberia, Kazakhstan etc. Some Jewish people in valued professions were evacuated to Central Asia - I know about some Jewish film animation makers in Uzbekistan i believe! Of the 300,000 polish Jews to survive the Holocaust (original pop. 3 million), about 200,00 were in Central Asia and eastern Russia for those reasons. Some stayed (either due to being forced to, or willingly living in the Jewish Oblast in Siberia).

Then there was far later emigration going on. In the 70s and 80s communist countries had resettlement agreements where Jews could apply to emigrate to Israel or America. Often they would face discrimination on doing so (losing jobs etc) but many got out. This was in the Soviet Union, Romania as well. Jews also fled countries when other people tried to escape. My family hosted a Jewish family who had escaped following the Hungarian 1956 uprising, our home is and was basically an open home for passing jews lol. 

Following the collapse of communism, there was also mass emigration. In Denmark, Polish jewish emigrants ended up living on ships in the harbour for a bit I think! Many Jews migrated to Israel and America, some to Canada and elsewhere, Australia etc. 

There’s also some specific reasons for the cities. Salonica had been the centre of the Jewish Mediterranean economy. After the holocaust, there was no reason to emigrate there any more. Vilnius had been the centre of Eastern European Jewish education, culture etc but increasingly the Jewish population would centre around cities with the largest survivors, such as Moscow which had of course not been affected. Sarajevo also saw the Jews being evacuated to Israel to flee the conflict. Turkey was unaffected by the holocaust but had contemporary antisemitism - pogroms and the Varlık Vergis law which financially threatened the Jewish population.",,/r/europe/comments/7qkifl/europes_jewish_city_populations_then_and_now/dsq6nkr/,HarknATshaynik,1516045491

&gt; Why might an approved drug be used for an unapproved use?


#


&gt;From the FDA perspective, once the FDA approves a drug, **healthcare providers generally may prescribe the drug for an unapproved use when they judge that it is medically appropriate for their patient.**
You may be asking yourself why your healthcare provider would want to prescribe a drug to treat a disease or medical condition that the drug is not approved for.  One reason is that **there might not be an approved drug to treat your disease or medical condition**.  Another is that you may have tried all approved treatments without seeing any benefits.  In situations like these, you and your healthcare provider may talk about using an approved drug for an unapproved use to treat your disease or medical condition.


It's done all the time and the FDA knows about this. The APA, NHS, BPS, and other reputable medical bodies have approved the use of HRT to treat transgender individuals so healthcare providers have sufficient backing to provide treatments. There is just no drug specifically used to treat trans people because they constitute so few of the general population, that's why they have to rely on effects from drugs commonly used to treat other diseases. Androcur is a drug used to treat prostate cancer but it's androgen suppressing effects have made in a preferred choice for countries outside the US in the treatment of trans people. The fact is still that prescribing hormones for trans people is still the most effective option for treatment as other methods have failed and the FDA's stance reflects on this.",Westernized Asian,/r/europe/comments/7qk274/the_annual_number_of_referrals_to_the_gender/dspzaea/,StuckInABadDream,1516038363

4236,"Though I understand your point, I'm convinced that you overestimate the popularity of Europe as a destination for those from the Americas - successful emigration to the US is the dream for the vast majority of those from Central and South America. I dare say that, with the exception of a few Brazilians (oftentimes in possession of Italian citizenship), Europe doesn't register. 

&gt;. The problem is that in most countries you can't hire a highly qualified American or Mexican over a lousy Swede or Bulgarian.

I don't know where you got that impression, but if a Swede cannot fill a job then an American will be offered it. If both are equally qualified then it will be given to the Swede - that is merely practical, what with visas etc. Besides, in my opinion there ought to be a Europe first narrative, that is, in many ways, the purpose of the European Union.

I think the confusion on your end stems from the belief that Europe is short of low skilled labour - currently, that is not the case. Individual countries may be low on labour, but the EU doesn't, at present, require a mass introduction of low skilled labour. 

I should add that if, a some future stage the EU does require low skilled labour, and MENA immigration dwindles, then it would makes sense to consider promoting immigration into the EU from the Americas.",,/r/europe/comments/7qcc2g/germany_is_silencing_hate_speech_but_cannot/dspzj4j/,jackiec1990,1516038599

People don't talk about Germans that much here because idiots talk about them all the time, I don't think there's a more boring and common insult than calling a German a Nazi (kinda like calling Romanians gypsy), and they've been pretty apologetic about them overtimes (unlike Turks or Hungarians), don't deny what happened at all, exactly the opposite, there's this thing people call ""German guilt"" which kinda affects them in weird ways, to the point that even now they hate their own army and are willing to allow no matter how many people in their country, things for which your own ""Viktor Orban"" is accusing them now. 

In general the ""Germans Genocides"" topic is a corpse which has been beaten so much it doesn't even have meat anymore, what's the point of bringing it up more ? 


For the Turks people do bring it up, but the ones most affected by it (The Armenians) simply don't have that many users of reddit, so it is usually brought up as a way to annoy Turk users, so it's not that common. 

Romanian redditors however are quite common on /r/europe so of course the issue has more coverage. If the Danes did some sort of Genocide in the recent history of Sweden, I assure you Swedish people would bring it up on reddit all the time too. 

Or Poles too, they bring up what happen to them in WW2 pretty much in almost absolutely any Polish thread that appears and gives a chance for it. 

So don't think you're special, you're not. It just annoys you because you hate that Romanians talk about it, and you wish you just wouldn't see it at all, which is no different than Turks hating someone talking about the Armenian Genocide, that annoyance is wrong and it gives me pleasure to see it appear in people who are such in denial of ""historical crimes"".

That's true for Romanians as well, I had a gigantic scandal on Christmas with my entire family because somehow the topic of WW2 was brought up, and the invasion of Odessa and I was insisting that Romanian soldiers did a lot of crimes in Ukraine, and my family thought they were ""justified"" and I couldn't accept that and had a hard line ""crimes are crimes, none are justified, our ancestors were criminals too"" and I was kinda alone on defending my point but instead of giving up I just argued the entire Christmas day with my entire family and left pissed, and I still don't regret it.

4365,"&gt;Taking somebodies property is violence.

No, its theft.

&gt;If not directly, then it is certainly backed by the threat of violence.

Threats of violence aren't violence. The very law itself is backed by the threat of violence, the concept of law is still ethical.

&gt;There's not much moral difference between threatening to kill somebody in order to take their stuff and just killing them and taking it.

Thats not the threat they make. ""We are taking your stuff and if you try and stop us, we will resist your attempts to stop us."" is not ""We will kill you if you don't give us your stuff."" Ultimately the only place violence can be introduced is by the owner of the thing being taken.
&gt;There is also a significant difference between the state, through a democratic mandate, using the threat of force to take taxes and providing things in return and a small number of radicals attempting to take what they feel they are entitled to by force. 

You are right: The state taking things it never contributed to at all, by the will of people who never had anything to do with that thing, is quite clearly far *less* ethical than 1000 workers taking control of the factory they actually work at, from a single individual who did not work there.

Contrary lithuanian-language schools were opened after uprising in the Suwałki region which at that time was part of the vestigial Polish Kingdom, and lithuanian identity was promoted in a opposition to polish identity which was dominanting in the whole Lithuania at that time.

Ideas is what shape humans and society first and foremost. This is idealism

Marx the materialist would flip this and note that before anyone can even have ideas of any note they first need to reproduce themselves as people, and that the manner and circumstances under which they reproduce themselves inevitably shape their world view. Material  conditions and relations take primacy over ideas.  This is materialism. This is also why Marx was so  extremely critical of the Utopian Socialists who preceded him  and who believed that people would just have to be made aware of socialism as a concept and the ruling class would by the power of the idea simply agree to implement socialism.

True, the Netherlands are also affected and it's an issue, but Germany is 25% of the Eurozone in population and maybe a third of it in GDP. This problem has direct consequences on other countries, so unlike say Bulgaria, it's not only itself that Germany would fix by fixing its current account surplus, so it's more interesting to study.

Fortunately if as OP's article says austerity is ending for real and focus on investment and public spending is increased, this is a good sign that in some 5 years the current account surplus issue will start to improve. Usually I don't buy ""trust me, I'll do it"" appeals, but on one hand public spending has already increased to accommodate for migrants which did drive up consumption, and on the other hand wages have started to increase again to follow productivity growth and inflation.

A very recent scandal involved the minister of inner affairs who stated that we should ""concentrate immigrants to certain locations"" (very bad choice of words considering Austria's dark history in WW2)...that definitely made more people go onto the streets and protest against that government. 

But there are many other things which this government is trying to implement like education fees for students, cancelling of a law against smoking in restaurants that was already in place and ready to be implemented by the start of this year, shortening of social benefits and so on...

Indeed, but they haven't have they? Some of the campaign aspects have been shown to be misleading, at best, some people lied, but there are many perfectly valid reasons for voting leave, and have been for quite some time.

&gt;When they blame immigrants for all the problems, yes you can call them racist.

You can to a certain extent, but if they don't you can't.

Essentially you are picking a set of arguments that you find easy to dismiss rather than address, and that's hardly new. It's generally far easier to do that than to actually look at the issues..

&gt;The date has shown for a long time what the EU does and how it has benefited the UK. The people who don't like the EU are generally are the ones who like to abuse people, or still live in the age of the British Empire.

Economically? To some extent probably yes although not without negatives. In other ways? Less so. If the UK were Poland it would be far easier to argue the former (the EU provides a lot of benefit to quite a few of its members), but it isn't and so it's a bit more complicated.  

As to the people who don't like the EU being people who 'like to abuse people, or still live in the age of the British Empire', again, you seem to be building a nice caricature that is easy to ridicule and dismiss, rather than anything based in reality..

&gt;Facts are facts, people who voted leave ignored them.

They didn't, they had different priorities and used the same facts to inform their decisions.

Based on your comment above though, you seem convinced that you get to create your own facts and prefer to argue against constructs that have little basis in reality, but make you feel better... Of course idiot racists, acting against the data and opposed to the facts would make the wrong choice when offered one! That'd make it incredibly easy to see that they were wrong and you were right, because after all, you are not an idiot racist, who acts against the data and opposed to the facts. Unfortunately for you, that isn't the situation and all you seem to have managed to do is miss that the other side has valid arguments, because you decided you already knew what their arguments were.

4481,"Mate, don't know what your source is, but first, there wasn't anything called Turkish Cypriots back then but it's Muslim Cypriots, and secondly, it wasn't a mob, but pasha's own forces. You pretty much saying what I've said, local pasha hanging the archbishop and seizing supplies and try to cut off the funding. There hasn't been any clashes or massacres between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, but local pasha went and hanged the archbishop after closing the walled city of Nicosia, and trying to curb and cut down help to the Greece by force which of course meant violence. That was pretty much it though; no conflict between communities, no clashes, no intercommunal violence or massacres by any community on anyone. Keep in mind that Muslim/Turkish Cypriots and Ortodox/Greek Cypriots revolted against the pashas in Cyprus in the 1833 and during the 1804-1805 period, together. In order words, nobody was fine with the pashas, nor any Cypriots were siding with the ruling elites of Ottomans in the island before or after the Greek Revolt. 

Cypriots are also responsible for what have happened for sure, yet they pretty much played the roles Brits made for them in the first place. Nobody says the sole responsible party was the Britain, but Britain was the one that enabled and pretty much started it. 

I also don't recall saying TMT and EOKA not committing crimes against the other community and their own community. Those were terror acts on the civilians, but both weren't there for those or their aim wasn't terror against their own community or the other Cypriot community. They have became terror organisations in that sense, and I do agree on that.

&gt; Didn't hear about a massacre in one of the bases, could you tell me more about it ?

Not in the base, but Brits refused to send any convoy or any of their forces they used to send to accompany the Turkish Cypriot workers of the bases, even after they were called to send since it was the possibility of them being attacked on the way. Turkish Cypriot workers decided that they had to go there since otherwise they won't be paid and the whole enclave would suffer, and their bus had lost on the way as expected. At the end, a mass grave has been found and the remainers were identitied as those workers.

&gt; And they did allow refugees to enter, there is even a town in one of the bases now founded by them. But yeah mainly they stayed in the bases

Well, they haven't done anything other than staying in their bases, while the very legitimisation of those bases were to protect the order in Cyprus and so on.

&gt; Well unless you are omniscient you can't. Also there would of been both Turkey and Greece wanting the Island for their own ends which would likely create a conflict.

Ah that's for sure, but without British tactics making both sides killing some from each other for no reason, like recruiting poor Turkish Cypriots as the special commando forces just against the EOKA fighters, or spreading rumors about this or that group is going to attack to this and that and trying to ensure some stupid fights and so on, tensions wouldn't turn into a whole scale violence or at least it would have been a lower degree.

&gt;Those against the war were expelled from the SPD in January 1917 (including Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht and Hugo Haase) - the expelees went on to found the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany, in which the Spartacist League was influential.

And in the [Spartacist Uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartacist_uprising) she was explicitly against violence, just as the majority of other KPD leaders:
&gt;Liebknecht demanded the overthrow of the government. Rosa Luxemburg, as well as the majority of KPD leaders, considered a revolt at this moment to be a catastrophe and explicitly spoke out against it.

Notably this ""uprising"", despite being called that, was neither planned nor organised by the Spartacus League or the KPD. The [Freikorps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freikorps), predecessors of the Nazi militia, were the ones opening fire on the demonstrators. 

Sure there were radical elements within the protests who wanted to violently overthrow the government, but neither was she herself part of that group nor did that group ever get into control. Most of the people participating immediately surrendered because when military shows up to your protest with machine guns, flamethrowers and artillery - that's what you do. More than hundred protesters were still killed.

And finally she was murdered in her home under the orders of [Waldemar Pabst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldemar_Pabst) with the intention of making it looks like a random homicide.

Sure the British forces didn't help and were occupiers, but let's not remove all agency from the Cypriots. You can hardly blame all the communal violence on us and ignore your part it in.

&gt; I've had several brits tell me that, so I'm a bit surprised.

Loads of British people have no clue about beer.

Our traditional beer brewing industry was (nearly!) destroyed by mass industrial standardisation. And then people moved across to drinking continental style lagers. So knowledge lost.

The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) were instrumental in stopping the decline and keeping our traditional cask beer (‘real ale’) in the UK. And they can take good credit for keeping alive beer making that then exploded in to the worldwide craft beer movement.

With the vast worldwide interest in good beer (craft beer etc) the battle is arguably won!

Edit to answer this:

&gt; Personally I'd call anything ""warm fermented"" an ale, as opposed to pilsner/lager,

4699,"&gt;On the morning of January 15, 2018, in one of the schools in Motovilikhinsky district of Perm, a fight was fought between two schoolchildren with the use of cold weapons (knives), which teachers and schoolchildren tried to prevent. As a result, students and the teacher were injured. 

&gt;In the school was sent 8 ambulance brigades: 2 resuscitation, 2 pediatric and 4 linear medical.&lt;...&gt;At the moment, 15 people were injured, 12 of them were hospitalized. A woman (teacher) and two young people aged 15-16 years in serious condition were sent to the city clinical hospital No.4. At the moment, they are in the operating room. Another 9 injured children have already been examined by doctors, superficial injuries have been found, they have been sent to the Children's Regional Clinical Hospital. All necessary assistance is provided to them.

&gt;Sergei Sarapultsev, deputy head of the Investigation Department of the Perm region, added that fourth-grade pupils were injured in the attack.

&gt;Specialists were also sent by the Ministry of Education and Science. The press service of the department also added that the need to attract additional measures for the psychological support of schoolchildren is being considered. The situation in Perm is supervised personally by the Minister of Education.

&gt;In addition, Anna Kuznetsova, the Russian president's authorized representative for the rights of the child, flew to the scene of the incident.

&gt;According to the children's ombudsman, she intends to find out ""How the armed guys ended up in school. Who did not react to the situation and why, where the guards were."" ""Fourth-grade pupils defended the teacher, who tried to stop 16-year-old boys fighting on knives,"" Kuznetsova noted.

Studies have shown again and again that the whole population benefits from immigration, yes especially heavy immigration into one sector can lead to a wage shock, however the lower prices etc. balance that out, so while a small group of people in a certain field might suffer, the overall population greatly benefits.

So the governments duty is more about how to alleviate the stress on that small subsection through the surplus of ressources it gets from immigration.

And that is with the most extreme example which would be massive immigration into a single sector of the economy, with spreadout immigration the negatives are a lot smaller while the positives still apply.

Most people who lived at that time usually say ""We didn't believe that we could ever break out"" and that can be understood, look at Russia and their population and then Estonia.

Once the USSR started breaking up certain events took place (such as the song festival) that moved that grey mass into thinking ""look, no one opposed us"" and more people became activists on a certain level.

But in a sense it was peaceful as no real war happened, only quite heavy control of people and their movement and censorship. Most people still had to go to work to earn to eat to live, that didn't change.

Still only a couple of generations 60 years ago these peoples parents or relatives fought in the independence war against Russian reds (and whites on occasion) and at that point only about ~35 years ago independence was lost so most of the living population remembered those times.

Could I ask what the name of these agencies are?

This is probably where it's hurting me. That's *a lot* less than my income here. Less than half even. I guess I need to ask myself how much of a pay cut I'm prepared to take to get to Germany.  

For reference, I am having no issue finding work in London for the GBP 65,000. But for some reason, no cigar in Germany. 

&gt;I would suggest Berlin, Frankfurt (especially with Finance experience) or Munich

Munich is definitely my preferred area. I guess my draw to FinTech is that I have a solid decade of experience as a Financial Accountant plus my CompSci background....

4760,"&gt; Wont help those killed in WWII or the KZ`s or by nazi terrorist attacks since then.

Yea it will help. You can easier ridicule something when you are free to talk about it. Hell it is even easier for them to ridicule themselves just by letting them talk about it.

&gt;And we Germans believe there should also be asterisks for denying the holocaust, different cultures different history's.

And there is no reason for that. Like that 89 year old grandma is a threat to your security for not believing in the Holocaust.

&gt;Also asterisks against libel.

&gt;&gt;Grow a thicker skin.

Libel is damaging to the freedom of others. It can ruin lives. How did you even make the comparison? 

&gt;you linked me 2 articles of Nazis being imprisoned, does seem to help.

And they didn't stop being nazis. And I am pretty sure it made other nazis more persistent. 

&gt;We have had very little nazi activity since those laws were passed.

You obviously haven't read any far right philosophy to understand that nazism won't go on the streets rioting like communist. They believe in ""riding the tiger"" untill it is exhausted. Of course you won't see any nazi activities. 

&gt;These laws don't ""prevent terrorism"". Terrorists will be Terrorists without calling themselves Terrorists .

You Germans were always bad at irony. You just confirmed it. I didn't say ""prevent terrorism"". I said ""prevent terrorism incitement"". A jihad calling imam for instance. Like the one Belgium expelled.

&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance

You seem to consider intolerant an 89 year old grandma for not believing in a historical fact. That is simply ridiculus.

&gt;We let Nazis freely express there hatred once beforehand, didn't go so well so we decided to stop that practice.

4774,"It should be noted that this post may be controversial, due to her political views, but I feel that [Rosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Luxemburg) was a figure which is important to understand the monumental history of Germany between both World Wars. An avowed Marxist who associated herself with the SPD and quickly became a staunch critic of the First World War and worked with people to oppose the Kaiser, and the War. Even as an avowed socialist at the time, she became one of the staunchest critics of Vladimír Lenin and the October Revolution, going so far as to proclaim in her writings that “Freedom is always the freedom of the one who thinks differently”. She was imprisoned for her writings and advocacy against the war, but once freed, her and Karl Liebknecht, a close ally worked to establish a Socialist Republic. The attempts of Her, Karl and the Spartacus League League she created were largely unsuccessful, with minor trade union and direct action sometimes succeeding , but large scale demonstrations being suppressed. The revolution was considered a failure by Rosa, and she and Karl were swiftly executed.

This post is not meant to be a glorification of Rosa Luxemburg, and her controversial legacy certainly is understandable. but to understand the political and social life from within Germany during this period of time,and how her and other political views like hers grew, it is important to understand Rosa as a figure.

4830,"I feel like this guy just wants to write about guerrillas.

&gt;The light, armored, NATO conventional forces stationed in the Baltic States would put up a determined, if brief, fight, but would be defeated or brushed aside by numerically superior advancing Russian forces. NATO reinforcements would neither be available nor able to arrive in time to prevent the occupation of territory.

So?  I don't get the obsession with the vulnerability of the Baltics.  The RAND paper a while back kept going on about it too.  Yes, they're vulnerable to a surprise attack.  And Russia would achieve nothing of war-balance-changing effect by doing that, so she'd give up the advantage of surprise — which would be pretty much the only thing she has going for her — and start a war with a considerably more powerful alliance.  As a result, that would be a bad idea for Russia to do, and thus she's not very likely to do it.

The aim is not to defend every point against attack.  It's to keep anything from falling that would keep successfully fighting back from happening.  As long that it's clear that this will happen, a deterrent exists, so you can likely avoid even the damage from the conflict itself.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7qaw9h/modern_guerrillas_and_the_defense_of_the_baltic/dspayq2/,vokegaf,1515997067

&gt;Canada has donated a bevy of non-lethal military equipment, totalling about $16 million, according to access to information documents obtained by CBC News. 
&gt;
&gt;The support is in addition to the roughly 200 military trainers who are helping instruct Ukrainian army troops, many of them conscripts, in the finer points of close combat.
&gt;
&gt;Overall Canada has provided $700 million in economic and stabilization assistance to Ukraine since Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula and backed a separatist insurgency in the east of the country.

Both Canada and the US just authorized arms export of heavier weapons:

https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/12/13/ottawa-opens-doors-for-canadian-arms-exports-to-ukraine.html

&gt;OTTAWA—The Trudeau government is opening the door to the export of Canadian-made weapons and ammunition to Ukraine in what is being touted as a sign of Canada’s enduring support for the battle-scarred country.

http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/world/american-made-lethal-weapons-heading-to-ukraine-1.4463682

&gt;U.S. officials said Friday that the Trump administration approved a plan to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine, a long-awaited move that deepens America's involvement in the military conflict and may further strain relations with Russia.
&gt;
&gt;The new arms include American-made Javelin anti-tank missiles that Ukraine has long sought to boost its defences against Russian-backed separatists in the country's east. The fighting has killed more than 10,000 since 2014. Previously, the U.S. has provided Ukraine with support equipment and training, and has let private companies sell some small arms like rifles.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7q519s/this_photo_was_taken_last_week_in_eastern_ukraine/dsp5009/,vokegaf,1515987871

The difference now is that it’s baked into the first price you are shown and not the second price. And a business we’re few customers use credit cards the overall price increase will be minuscule (say cc fee is 1.4% and 5% of customers use cc that means the business would have to increase their prices overall by 0.07% which is not noticeable. The same also applies to every competitor.

In fact a uniformed price standard will increase competition resulting in lower prices. Currently, comparing the cost of a product across many suppliers is not easily possible because of all the extra charges that are hidden till the payment step. Hence, the EU regulation for airlines to disclose total cost as otherwise price comparisons are difficult.

There is a difference between ""the resistance"" and simply ""not fighting for Nazis"". The people in the countries which Germany conquered weren't about to start fighting in the Nazi Army regardless of the resistance. 

And even if they DID put on Nazi uniforms, there still wouldn't be enough Nazi soldiers. Spain was out of the war, the Italians fought with the Nazis but the Italian soldiers were worthless. Where exactly was Nazi Germany going to get all these other soldiers from?

The fact of the matter is that ethnic Germans were the only demographic base that would ever populate the Nazi army and there simply were never enough ethnic Germans to win World War II. Even today there are less than 100 million ethnic Germans living in Europe.

5073,"&gt;They even did that in WW1 DESPITE it being an ""European civil war"" and the American pop. being split on the issue.

Ehhhhhh…the US was generally very opposed to entry.  US public sentiment had been to stay out of Europe pretty much since the the US was born.  Pre-World-War-1 US was very unlike post-World-War-2 US.

[George Washington's Farewell Address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington%27s_Farewell_Address):

&gt;Washington goes on to urge the American people to take advantage of their isolated position in the world, and to avoid attachments and entanglements in foreign affairs, especially those of Europe, which he argues have little or nothing to do with the interests of America. He argues that it makes no sense for the American people to become embroiled in European affairs when their isolated position and unity allow them to remain neutral and focus on their own affairs. He argues that the country should avoid permanent alliances with all foreign nations, although temporary alliances during times of extreme danger may be necessary. He states that current treaties should be honored but not extended.
&gt;
&gt;Washington wraps up his foreign policy stance by advocating free trade with all nations, arguing that trade links should be established naturally and the role of the government should be limited to ensuring stable trade, defending the rights of American merchants, and any provisions necessary to ensure the conventional rules of trade.

Additionally, the US had long had a major aversion to maintaining a substantial military in peacetime: this was seen as a potential tool of tyranny.  A major concern was that large peacetime armies were something done by European governments who sought to control their people.  [When World War II kicked off, the US had a smaller army than Portugal did](http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/jun/13/ken-paxton/us-army-was-smaller-army-portugal-world-war-ii/).

It required two major international incidents to break the US out of isolation in World War I:

**[Resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrestricted_submarine_warfare)**

&gt;The Germans disregarded the law during the First World War following the British introduction of Q-ships with concealed deck guns, and in the most dramatic episode sank Lusitania in 1915 in a few minutes because they believed it was carrying war munitions.[4] Though denied by successive British governments for decades, it was eventually revealed that the Germans were correct about Lusitania's cargo.[5][6] The U.S. demanded it stop, and Germany did so. Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff, chief of the Admiralty staff, argued successfully in early 1917 to resume the attacks and thus starve the British. The German high command realized the resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare meant war with the United States but calculated that American mobilization would be too slow to stop a German victory on the Western Front.

And the **[Zimmerman Telegram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimmermann_Telegram)**:

&gt;The Zimmermann Telegram (or Zimmermann Note or Zimmerman Cable) was a secret diplomatic communication issued from the German Foreign Office in January 1917 that proposed a military alliance between Germany and Mexico in the prior event of the United States entering World War I against Germany. Mexico would recover Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. The proposal was intercepted and decoded by British intelligence. Revelation of the contents enraged American public opinion, especially after the German Foreign Secretary Arthur Zimmermann publicly admitted the telegram was genuine on March 3, and helped generate support for the United States declaration of war on Germany in April.[1] The decryption was described as the most significant intelligence triumph for Britain during World War I,[2] and one of the earliest occasions on which a piece of signals intelligence influenced world events.

5098,"&gt;Ergo they're ugly enough that we should just get rid of them. 


Them being ugly was my point, something you initially denied the OP said (""The person I replied to said nothing about modern skyscraper design.""). Again, the OP said ""sure they might offer more efficient use of space, but is it really worth it?"" Nothing in this implies they should be torn down, only that perhaps skyscrapers should no longer be built — the comment was postulative. 

&gt;I don't think the arguments against modern architecture are even slightly as simple as simple as people just not liking it much of the time. Just in this thread we've seen the ""They're not European"" argument - I consider the demonising of any architecture that isn't in the revered category snobbery. 


Considering that modern architecture was created in Europe, I don't see how it can be ""not European"", and frankly, this isn't an argument I've ever really come across. Europe is absolutely covered in modern architecture – just not skyscrapers. I've never heard of anyone say ""I really love the look of modern architecture, but I just can't stand to be around it because it doesn't fit into my preconceived notions of Europe"". No, 99% of people don't like modernism because they don't like the look of it. Plain and simple. 

&gt;It's not about hating what replaces the building, it's about humans having a pathological fear of losing possessions and general change. 


While this is partially true, the case of the church in Germany was more complicated. People loathed its destruction not because they had any connection to it, or because they wanted to visit it someday, or even because they thought it was of particular historic value; they genuinely hate that a beautiful testament to art and craftsmanship will be replaced by a coal mine. Said coal mine will dry up in 30 years and become yet another hole in the ground, *itself* a testament to environmental destruction. 

&gt;It doesn't matter what circumstances happened to generate a situation where German cities are difficult to distinguish from each other, it just matters that it's the case. Frankfurt is unique because of its skyscrapers and if it weren't for those, it would be completely nondescript. Do you disagree with that or not?


I suppose this is true. However, I don't think the general blandness/nondescriptiveness of modern architecture that created this situation should be ignored, especially seeing as it relates heavily to the complaints put forward by the OP (""zero personality"", ""no idea what continent the city is on""). 

&gt;This feels like such a shoehorned point just so you can air some general grievances you have with people who defend skyscrapers. I don't think I ever said that Frankfurt's skyline being impressive was important? It is unique as the only German city where you can walk around, look up, and see lots of very tall glass buildings around you. It's so ridiculous to go into an argument automatically assuming that the person you're arguing with simply has no idea what's *actually* important, while you naturally do. Obviously if I disagree with you, it's because I'm just looking at cities as things to see from afar.


No, it's a point because you said ""Frankfurt without skyscrapers has absolutely nothing to distinguish it from any other town in the country, and there is little value in being pretty when every place around you is equally so."" Your point was clearly to do with your own grievance that European cities are so lowrise and all look similar from a skyline perspective. You talk of the supposed sameness of these ""pretty"" towns around Frankfurt (because they lack the skyscrapers that makes Frankfurt distinct), ignoring the diverse architecture, city layout, geography, and histories of these ""pretty"" places. By this reasoning, Heidelberg, Reutlingen, Wiesbaden, or Marburg are all very much the same merely because they lack a distinguishing skyline. 

&gt;That is part of the problem with your argument. Whether or not skyscrapers are worth it requires this to be taken into account, and cannot just be a discussion of aesthetics. If you don't want to discuss the economic side of high-rise building then you should never have initially replied to me arguing with someone who posited that skyscrapers may not be worth the efficiency they bring.


The only part of your initial comment I replied to was your assertion that the OP wanted skyscrapers torn down. 

&gt;I don't get how you can tell me that I shouldn't boil housing crises down to one factor (I never did - I said lack of high-rise was a ""huge contributing factor"") while simultaneously arguing that skycrapers don't help anything because Australia has them and still has high prices. I'm aware that housing prices are affected by many factors, but most of them don't apply to Ireland. Unlike Australia we don't have huge investment in our property market coming from China, and unlike cities like Barcelona, Dublin is not a huge tourist destination, so AirBNB isn't leaving us with tons of empty apartments. We just have no room. And even if other issues are at play, making more room still relieves pressure.
In addition, I find it baffling that you think that skyscrapers rarely just being very tall apartment blocks means that they can't alleviate space issues. You realise that if you don't have skycrapers, office space needs to be more spread out, right? The smaller and taller a spot you can pack all of your companies into, the more room there is for housing. Paris can only sustain its relatively low-rise city centre because La Défense is extremely tall and very dense.



I never said ""skyscrapers don't help anything because Australia has them and still has high prices"". I was making a general comment about how the height of buildings in far less contributive to inflated housing prices than you make out. It's not about height, it's about density. And, as I said, there are many lowrise city's that are much denser than city's filled with high and medium rise structures. 

Also, there is a well defined CBD within Paris proper (La Défence is outside the city limits), and it houses 4 times as many offices as La Défence, largely because it's infinitely denser than La Défence, despite all those dreaded low rises. And even though these offices affect *population* density, Paris proper *still* (as I said) has one of the greatest population densities on earth. Odd how apart from the Tour Montparnasse, there are scarcely any high rises in Paris city. 

&gt;Using this quote to discuss your broader point on urban planning. Essentially yes, it is true that you can build for density without resorting to a skyscraper district (at least up to a point), but what are you to do when your country's urban planners aren't flawless? Just accept that you won't have enough room? And if your urban planners are good enough that they can sustain a high-density city with a fairly low-rise skyline, they should be good enough to make skyscrapers work with space efficiently anyway.


There needs to be a shift in urban planning and government towards the conscious creation of dense, yet liveable and people friendly urban zones. The issue is that governments and investors are so keen to just get buildings and apartments on the ground, that there is little long-term forethought — they're thinking about solving the *short-term* housing issues that they have *now*. Blocks are dropped wherever they'll fit, contributing to the very same urban sprawl that we're constantly being told needs to be reigned in. This shift *will* have to happen I think, but the longer we put it off the more expensive and painful it'll be. The rapidly growing world population actually *necessitates* that this happen, lest our cities become urban hellholes that have long foresaken environmental preservation. 

As for how high-rises/skyscrapers fit into this, that obviously remains to be seen. I still think New York is a great example of traditional residential density combined with the large office spaces skyscrapers usually provide. Now granted, you can't have too many skyscrapers in this kind of model, because that reduces sunlight down below, where most people live. The skyscrapers in New York work because they are usually *neatly* into the classical blocks first laid down in the 18th/19th century. The very same kind that Paris (and other similar European cities) owe their density to. Look at [Paris from above](https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/5715/0279/e58e/ce1a/e000/0057/large_jpg/Arc_de_Triomphe.jpg?1460994656).

Or [Barcelona](https://twistedsifter.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/eixample-district-barcelona-from-above-aerial-satellite.jpg?w=800&amp;h=450). Or [Vienna](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U2sY_GByds8/Vi5b68rL6OI/AAAAAAABEHA/aSvjeF9zTsc/s1600/vienna_aerial_street_view.jpg). Compare these to [Los Angeles](http://happeningindtla.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ANTHELIONDTLA13DSC_2292Printable-768x960.jpg), or even [central Dublin](http://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/2675491/original?width=600&amp;version=2675491), which damaged its close knit streetscape during shortsighted 'urban renewal' in the decades after WWII. The potential future of a skyscraper-filled Europe will depend on population growth. And in lots of places the population is stagnating or even shrinking. If I remember correctly, Ireland is one of the few countries that can expect sizeable population growth in the next decades, so I think policy will change. At the very least, Dublin will probably develop something á la La Défence. 

Regardless, I wish Ireland and Dublin luck working through these issues :) It can be done, there just needs to political will and well thought out policy.",,/r/europe/comments/7pz4fs/frankfurt_germany/dsp1w4m/,Viva_Straya,1515983730

5123,"Germany saw a large increase in 2016 as well. 2017 numbers will probably not be published before June. 

- 2013: 459 UK citizen were naturalized. 1.94% of all EU citizen naturalized in 2013
- 2014: 515 - 1.94%
- 2015: 622 - 2.30%
- 2016: 2865 - 8.96% of all EU citizens naturalized

Interestingly the UK citizens that got naturalized in 2016 are quite old. Average age was 52.9 years. Compared to a EU-27 average age of 38.4 years. Which makes sense when you look at the next statistic. 

With the years of residency it also becomes obvious that Brexit is a driving factor for the increase. On average UK citizens who were naturalized in 2016 have been living in Germany for 30 years. That's the highest duration in the EU, EU-27 average is 21.5 years. 75% of them have been living in Germany for more than 20 years. Among the EU-27 44% have been living here for more than 20 years. 

65% of the UK citizens that got naturalized are married. Unfortunately there's no statistics about the citizenship of their partner. But only 65 of them used naturalization via marriage to a German partner as the way to naturalization. Which could be either because they aren't married to a German, or because they have been staying in Germany for so long that the naturalization after 8 years of residency was just easier. The latter was chosen by 84% of the people.  

99.8% of them now have dual citizenship. Only 10 gave up their citizenship. 



Enough statistics for tonight. 


----

And before someone claims that these are all 2nd generation Germans whose parents migrated to the UK, they aren't. Germans don't have to naturalize. And also only 79 of the UK citizens that naturalized live outside of Germany.

As such she does not live in a vacum. Her decisision WILL be influenced by others - the father who is too young and afraid of the consequences? Her peer is even more of a kid than she is. Or is the father a mature, married man afraid to ruin his marriage for a fling with a minor, so sure, he'll pay for the abortion? 


These influences, and a host of others, are a given and you're fine with that, but not with the parental input?

5211,"&gt; No they are not. No scientist will ever make such a ridiculous statement.

that is in fact untrue. Open your school biology book of choice and you will find that single celled organisms are considered to be life. Of course they are, they reproduce, consume energy and maintain themselves. They are alive and every biologist will tell you the same thing. Again, you cannot escape the discussion by doctoring with the definition of biological life. 

&gt;The difference is that fertilized human egg has the potential to become a human

a sperm and an egg are perfectly capable of being potential humans already. If someone commits a murder are they also murdering everybody's potential offspring? Potential life is of no moral consideration either.  

&gt;Animals eat each other all the time. Totally different context and discussion.

Not at all. Animals are alive, we eat animals. We end their lives daily. 

&gt;Okay and some people are not okay with ending a life. What can you do? The issue that we have in our societies general rules like don't kill each other. Why would it then be suspended for any circumstance

Many people are okay with ending life all the time. In Poland for example I assume it is perfectly legal to end someone's life in defense of your own property. I could consider theft of your property to be a mere inconvenience compared to the value of a human life.  Yet, why is this defensible? Because we respect the autonomy of individuals, and we don't consider life to be unconditionally valuable at all.

Oh for god's sake man, you're just repeating what I said and misinterpreting it as something else. I've reiterated that Germany is the most powerful country in the EU. You're confirmed this. Good, now let's move on 

&gt; Per capita Germans are underrepresented in the EU, if anything.

Yes, but in absolute power, they are still the most powerful. If your'e trying to suggest that Luxembourgers and Cypriots are the real leaders of Europe, you'd be wrong. If you're trying to gather sympathy for ""wounded Germany"" then you'd also be mistaken.

&gt; And that's not true. There's a big chunk that see it as a useful bureaucratic tool

But, again, why do Germans take the effects of Brexit so much more personally than the rest of Europe then? According to Eurostat, Germans very much do take a personal stake in Europe, how can you even deny that? 

&gt; I don't know.

&gt; Maybe Germans are just more wary of retarded decisions based on nothing but populism and vague xenophobia. And this explanation is just as good as yours.

Right so what you're suggesting is that Germans are simply better people? **You're suggesting Germans are.. in one way intellectually.. superior**? You are suggesting that it is only Germans who are able to see past populism and xenophobia and able to see what a utopia the EU really is? Remind me what happened the last time Germany had a ""we are better than you all"" mentality? Let's not pretend Germans are immune to xenophobia or populism, the fact that a far-right party has seats in parliament and yet the UK doesn't even have a far-right party is worrying

The fact that you resort to childish language by referring to Brexit as ""retarded"" or the psychology behind German power int he EU as a political ""hard-on"" is just illustrates how little you really understand of the situation and how poorly you are able to convey your points. You keep forgetting that most British redditors on here (including myself) are Remainers. There's no need to resort to (again) belittling entire nations and their populations just because you feel like you're right or feel the need to resort to using frankly offensive terms for 65 million people. I imagine you don't paint Muslims or Jews with the same brush, so who gives you the right to do it to the entire European continent (bar the ""wise Germans"")

Do you really think this or are you taking the piss?

Again, without being condescenging, have you ever been to Ireland? Because for example saying

would suggest to me youve never e.g. lived with Irish people or discussed this with them

Edit:

Regarding this paragraph

&gt; No-one in this thread said anything counter to Ireland being a separate entity. And while we're on the subject, no-one in the UK regards Ireland as any more ""ours""...

 I edited my earlier comment, I meant separate cultural entity. But anyway, the last link I posted above is an example,of what you hear sometimes, and the ""youre no different than us"" thing gets thrown around a lot. In this context, I think there is a definite tendency of some badly informed British people to wave away Irishness. Any Brits I know who hqve lived here do not think this.

It is a minority opinion, but the frequency it is aired gets annoying. Regarding the rest of that paragraph I agree completely.

Anyway as far as Im concerned, its not a big deal, since (as Ive said a few times) British people in general dont have a bad attitude about the topic at all, its just crossed wires",,/r/europe/comments/7qc799/percentage_of_eu_citizens_who_have_positive_view/dsof27a/,lbcbtc,1515959465
5344,"canadian soldiers have been training Ukrainian soldiers. Western training and equipment has actually helped the ukrainians quite a bit, since the national guard and army were using extremely dated equipment and were terribly organized and trained when the war first broke out. If you just compare pictures from 2014 and now you can visibly see the difference. The ukrainian forces have also become way more coordinated and their soldiers are getting more training. There’s a national guard battalion called Dnipro - 1, in 2015 the training time for a soldier was between 4 days and a week and a half, they’re now trained by foreign soldiers and have a month or so of training. 

People don’t really understand that at the beginning of the war quite a lot of ukrainian soldiers were just young poorly trained and under equipped men, who had basically zero idea what to do, now they’re very competent. And you have the US, canada, poland, and a few other countries who helped with that.

At the end of the day the problem is that our countries have been so stable also due to how tight the control on all types of communications was: the government could wiretap your phone, open your letters, censor newspapers and so forth.  
It worked because it wasn't feasible to do it for anyone but the small number of potential suspects of terrorism, espionage and other dangerous actors.

next time you work on your algo, give this a try:

write it as you normally would, once you're done, time it;

now, supposed you have matrices A, B, C, and you perform some operations in a loop using matrices a1, b1, c1, such as:

    mat A, B, C;
    //... code here
    for ...
       mat a1, b1, c1;
       a1 = A op B
       b1 = a1 op C
       c1 = a1 op b1
       A = someFunction(c1)

bring matrices a1, b1 and c1, at the beginning of your function and reuse them within the loop in stead of reallocating for each iteration, this is the first thing we do when we optimise code, for the scientist, it's easier to reference it when he uses it, performance wise, you want to avoid reallocations in loops, especially loops that have a few tens or more iterations

once you're done, time it, you may want to look at your activity monitor or task manager to see the amount of resources used, out of curiosity

the real optimisations are boring and time consuming, but it brings in quite a bit of boost, at minimum 2x every time

I'm not against Europe building it's supercomputer, however, that would divert some funds from other shiny machines, hence my original comment about cost effectiveness, if it's going to be used 24/7, it probably makes sense to build one, if it's going to be used something around 12h/day, it's questionable, anyways, it's not in my power to swing the vote in any direction, I'm merely a guy on the internets.",,/r/europe/comments/7q616z/europe_enters_race_to_build_worldclass/dso1pc0/,iroflmaowtf,1515944924

Comparatively, Lusophone countries are certainly closer in a brotherhood, shared values / culture kind of way. Francophonie is much tighter as an organisation, given that France is its strongest country, an international heavyweight, and capable and willing to lead. 

To understand the first, the ""brotherhood"" sense, just look at countries of the OIF such as Egypt or Central African Republic. Indeed there's plenty of cultural diversity in the Portuguese world, and the situation varies from country to country, but for various historical reasons (which would take a while to explain) there is some sort of bond. 

Regarding the second, the CPLP has Portugal has its most invested member, and Brazil as its heavyweight but comparatively less interested. This leads to leadership problems. It is also the source for some dysfunctionality (e.g. Angola finds the space to throw its weight around, often for the worse given it isn't the most functional country in the world, despite improvements). 

Note that there's little CPLP ""social pedagogy"". Meaning the society is quite removed from what's been happening in the organisation, which leads many to underestimate it. This is true even in Portugal, and I would say it is even more so in Brazil.

5574,"Well we also have formal bank id scheme. That is what government uses. But being part of that program means having contract with bank and it doesn't allow access to bank information. 

You go to some website wanting strong auth, they show what options they offer, like which banks, you select your bank. You get forwarded to banks website and log in, it then shows what website is asking authentication / payment authorization etc. You tell your bank to approve the request and get forwarded back.

like *the government population registry wants to know your identity*, which is verified by said entity and bank having formal relationship and them exchanging verification information so bank can reliable say *It really is population registry, since they have authenticated the request origin to us and we know them from our formal contractual relationship*. It isn't just that *request came from vrk.fi*, because bank doesn't grant authentication to random websites. Instead only to known entities they have contract for providing ID to. 

Screen scraping bypasses all this. Klarna might say *we are doing this*, but there is no way to verify what is being sent to bank, since it is Klarnas word. To be sure it would have to be bank telling it directly on a connection under banks control say Klarna/Third party can't modify the request information aka typically bank telling it directly on banks website/web form, which is out of Klarnas control.

Which Klarna can't do, because a) they don't have formal relationship with bank (banks charge money for providing authentication services, though if I remember correctly governments gets a freebie, since it's the government) and thus access to official request/forward to bank/ verify in bank/ return routine. B) the information isn't even available through the official APIs since it is still the transition period.

France, and specifically de Gaulle, saw this as a problem. They knew that one day European and US priorities wouldnt be guarenteed to be similiar. He was right.

It was an immense project and stretched across the Oppian, Esquilin and Palatin hills, lavishly decorated with frescoes, gilded stucco (hence the name) and marbles from across the empire.

After Nero's fall and murder, the later emperors imposed what the Romans called "" damnatio memoriae"", i.e. the deliberate erasure of emperor Nero's name and legacy from history. His palace was stripped of marbles and valuables, apart from the frescoes, and buried under meters of soil. The big lake of his private gardens was drained to make room for the construction of the Flavian amphitheater, better known as the Colosseum, as it stood originally next to a 35 mt high bronze statue of emperor Nero as a divinity.

The palace was only rediscovered in the 1400s and soon attracted many artists in search of roman antiquity. Its underground location made it look like a grotto and people climbed down with ropes from holes made in the ceiling. The bizarre and original style of the frescoes, which was a new style for the epoch, was called grotesque style and spread in European courts in the 1500s and 1600s.

But actually it would have been much better to let the old monarchical elites sign the surrender, because they couldnt have spread the stab-in-the-back myth later.

There are also some more points which can be criticized on Wilsons policy: That the represants of the Weimar republic havnt been allowed to take part in the peace negotaitions (unlike the defeated France in the Vienna Congress), that the self-determination of the people concerning their nation hasnt counted for many areas populated by Germans and that the Weimar Republic hasnt been allowed to the League of nations until 1926 surely hasnt helped the general acceptance of the Weimar democracy.

I don't know much about Schinkel other than that his real life works never matched his artistic aspirations. But I do know that the art nouveau that inspired Jugendstil should attribute partial credit to Japonism and that its abstract turn later on was mostly continental. 

Britain has had cultural sway, there are all sorts of interesting things to note if one knows what to look for, but I think your point is exaggerated. It's not overwhelmingly one-sided, Bauhaus and German expressionism are two easy examples that are widely influential. Nor is it unique - we certainly wouldn't want to deprecate the French, Latin, and Slavic influences. Russian literature and iconography have left its mark, and it's rather trivial to point out that the exchange of ideas and artistic idioms between France and the south are deep.  

There are many influences in the UK that may not be immediately obvious as being German in origin. Much New Testament scholarship even to this day begins with 19th Century German theologians, the modern research university is a German scientific legacy, and Joshua Billings (alot of great scholarship of German culture comes out of the UK, by the way) argues that the contemporary western understanding of Greek tragedy is really an interpretation stemming from German Idealism. Then there are more noticeable things, like the large presence of German composers in classical repertoires. But I think I understand what you may be thinking of now, since historically Germany has been quite open to English ideas while the island itself remained rather insular. That absolutely would reflect itself in older architecture, art, and texts. But I don't think that's as true as it once was, in part because German emigres and visitors have been so influential to British society in the latter half of the 20th Century. For the British, the names of Hayek, Wittgenstein, and Popper - but never Marx! - might as well be English. The British cognoscenti have certainly been influenced by German ideas of modernism and fine arts and philosophy, though not so much the broader society as a whole.

5771,"These are very interesting points and I’d like to take more time than I could to respond to them. And I presume you mean to say that you have little reason to believe that African and South American nations will ever reach EU levels of prosperity.

American political thought *has* changed and has begun to reshape policy, certainly among the American political left and more certainly still among younger American policy makers (eg. Obama). 

There is reason to ensure the economic prosperity of developing nations. First, because of the national security interest in building a close relationship with the developing world which will at some point become “developed” and are currently holding larger and larger places on the international stage. In fostering those relationships now - the Western paradigm and western ideologies of world order are built into the foundations of the social and political development of those countries which evolve right along side their economies. So there is a legitimate  reason to ensure their development, these countries seek aide and guidance in their determination to develop and modernize, we want to be there to provide it as opposed to allowing our current, “real”, competition (such as China) from being there. 

Again I’m on mobile and wish I could expand on a lot of this but to your later points, surely to suggest that 20th and 21st century world order has shifted back to power is true but I think it also ignores the last last eight years of policy from the US. Policy under the Obama administration is likely an indication of direction of policy, current administration notwithstanding. The Obama administration put a specific focus on world order based on legitimacy, using the state department to foster the building of democratic institutions abroad. Reducing military footprint. Attempting a Russian reset might be considered naive by critics but at least it indicates that he is driven by ideology. I’m not saying world order isn’t driven by power, I would say it’s driven more now by soft power, but I am saying that the pendulum has moved slightly 

We’re seeing protests for change in Egypt, Syria, Iran, Argentina. We’re seeing larger democratic movements in Mexico and to some extend in Africa. Technology is allowing the exposure of corruption through things like the Panama Papers which actually result in leadership shakeups across the world. It certainly seems like development and progress are happening at a faster rate today than it has before and that’s fostered largely by technology driven innovations and interventions, as well as US and EU backed world institutions like the UN or more importantly perhaps the IMF or World Bank.

&gt; ""scientists"" tend to use the most inefficient tools available

??  

Regarding the (honestly confusing) ""examples"" you're providing, there is always a trade-off between learning to use and setting up simulations with a new code, and the gains in computational time you'd have changing the code or optimizing for specific hardware et c. (e.g.: gcc / icc compilation).

That being said, *of course* if you are going to run simulations lasting weeks or months you will be more than careful about performance and possible improvements in computational cost.  

Also, this ""they use code over 100 times slower"" is just.. jsut nonsense.

5869,"&gt;Unemployment hasn't been this low since 1975, economic growth is doing better than what was forecast

Yet they're both worse off in real terms and growth than *every other similar economy*. The truth is that the world is riding a strong recovery, but the UK is doing worse relatively than everyone else. And that is due entirely to Brexit.

And honestly, and this point goes straight to Leave motivations, the recovery that has been happening is very split. The people at the bottom are *not* seeing this growth. They're pushed into precarious employment such as the ""gig"" economy without protections or guarantees. They're not property owners, and thus are getting screwed by the economic growth in asset prices. Real wages aren't rising at all for most (look at median wages). And in fact, they've trended down after the Brexit vote when they were rising before...

&gt;If you are of the opinion that net migration is too high and unsustainable, it will be a positive.

Most immigrants to the UK are *not* from the EU. They're from Commonwealth countries. The UK has *complete* control over that immigration and always has, yet the UK government has chosen not to restrict it. 

On top of that, when it comes to EU immigrants, the UK could implement stricter controls over employment and other checks, otherwise they need to leave (as other EU countries have implemented). The UK government, not the EU, is the one that chose not to do so.

The vast majority of migrants to America come through family, though; migrating via ""merit"" to the US is insanely complicated. Moreover, there is another way: the diversity lottery.

EDIT: I checked, less than 20% of the permanent residents are admitted on employment-based applications. In comparison, over 60% are family-based. The rest are mainly refugees, and to a lesser degree, the diversity lottery. Apparently the US accepts a similar number of employment-based migrants than refugees every year.

He keeps trying to make the point that Greece are underdogs compared to Europe. You will notice that in more than half of his charts Greece is ""deep red"" because of scoring very low in something. It doesn't matter if the data is legit - it is cherry picked or twisted around to paint Greece as a victim. Here, he claims that the chart shows ""households unable to make ends-meet"" but does not mention that this is based on a survey, i.e. the opinion of the respondents.

[This is the core of the argument right here from the guy's own site.](https://jodi.graphics/2017/11/07/%CE%BC%CE%AD%CE%BD%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BC%CE%B5-%CE%B5%CF%85%CF%81%CF%8E%CF%80%CE%B7/)

Top header ""We Stay in Europe!"" (ironic title of course, supports the ""No"" side in the 2015 referendum.)

Sub header ""Ranking of Greece among the 28 countries of the EU (2015)""

Source :""Eurostat""

* #1 in unemployment
* #1 in the reduction of disposable income (compared to 2008, that should ring a bell)
* #2 In the ineffectiveness of measures against poverty
* #2 In the percentage of unaddressed medical needs due to cost distance or waiting time
* #3 In the men-women employment gap
* #3 in risk of poverty or social exclusion
* #5 in the percentage of youths not in education or employment
* #5 in the increase of economic inequality
* #7 (from the bottom) in the percentage of population with basic digital literacy

It is not clear what all this has to do with Europe : you could argue that the Greek government is perfectly capable of doing a shit job on its own - but it is very effective in stirring anti-EU emotion.

Transsexualism will no longer be on the list of illnesses and handicaps that cause incapacity for active military service, according to a project prepared by the Ministry of National Defence. Transgender people can already serve in the Bundeswehr, for example.

Immediately after Christmas, the Government Legislative Centre published a draft of a new regulation prepared by MON on the determination of the ability to perform active military service and the procedures of military medical commissions in these matters. It would replace the current 2004 Regulation.

Basically, the proposal addresses three issues. Firstly, the need to prepare a new regulation results from the adoption at the end of 2016 of an amendment to the law on the general obligation to defend oneself, which established a new type of armed forces - the Territorial Defence Army.

 This amendment, which introduces, among other things, a new type of military service - territorial military service, foresees that the Ordinance on medical committees of 2004 will expire on 1 January 2018. MON is therefore delayed and now wants the new ordinance, including the WOT in the lists, to come into force one day after its publication in the Journal of Laws. However, it should be noted that this year's military qualification, i. e. the time when the military medical committees have the most work, will start on 30 January.


Secondly, once the proposed regulation comes into force, military psychological studios will be able to carry out psychological examinations for the benefit of military medical commissions. Today such research is outsourced to external commercial entities. In this respect, the project is intended to bring savings and to ensure adequate protection of information that is sensitive for both MON and the respondents.

Thirdly and finally, as stated in the explanatory memorandum, it adapts the provisions to the guidelines of the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) report on Poland, prepared by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance. ECRI is the Council of Europe's independent monitoring body for combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and intolerance. It is composed of independent experts from all Member States of the Council of Europe.

As admitted by MON, the recent ECRI report ""contained a number of detailed recommendations to the Polish authorities, which should be implemented before the next ECRI monitoring procedure"".

Until now, the military medical commission's statement of transsexuality meant that it automatically assigned category E, which is to say that the person concerned was permanently and completely incapable of active military service in peacetime and in the event of mobilisation and war. If the proposed regulation enters into force as it stands, transsexuality will no longer be included in the list of diseases and disabilities to be taken into account when assessing the physical and mental fitness for active military service.


Transsexuality is one of the gender identity disorders in which gender identity does not agree with morphological sex. The causes of this phenomenon remain unknown. It occurs on average in 4-5 persons per 100 thousand people.
Transsexuals serve, for example, in the Bundsewehr.

 In mid-October 2017, the Polish media circulated information about Lieutenant Colonel Anastasia Biefnag, which included command over 381 battalion of information technology in Storkow near Berlin. According to the Polish editorial staff of Deutsche Welle, Biefang had started his military service 23 years earlier as a man.

The current top supercomputer is the TaihuLight, listed at 93 Petaflops, which the TOP500 gives us as having around 10 million cores [1]. This project costing, as /u/irofimaowtf calculated, 14'000 EUR/hr, should end up being a ~1 exaflop cluster.

Making a comparison with the AWS service [2] for a middle-range machine (the m4.2xlarge) we have a 0.48 USD/hour for 8 cores.

If we were to make a very raw equivalency for cores/flops between the tianhu and this supposed new european cluster, and suppose we will have to rent all of that from AWS, we should rent a hundred million cores, which at 0.48 USD/hour for an 8-core machine ends up at 6 million USD/hour.

So, your 14k EUR/hour *ching-ching* ... 

Please note that a lot of simplifications went on in the above, but the important thing, of course, is that comparing building your own infrastructure versus renting on-demand from a private company **doesn't even make any sense**.

5990,"I *do* know how the method works, what I find (almost) too good to be true is getting a perfect sample, that old, perfectly preserved in a standing structure, complete with all the rings still – probably including the bark, as removing it would probably have damaged the outer rings. However, leaving the bark on usually leads to uneven drying of the wood which causes cracks to form, increases the risk of rot and insect infestation, all of which can be a problem with preservation (especially of the outer rings).

Additionally, what they've dated is tree, and I'd like to see how it accurately dates the building. It hinges on the idea that the tree was instantly used after being felled, and used in one of the first, structurally integral parts of construction, where it can't have been put in later. Presumably this means the foundation or a similar place, which again is usually a problem for preservation.

Either way, ""lucky"" is an understatement, and that's why I'd like to read the report.",,/r/europe/comments/7q2ztb/largest_roman_city_gate_north_of_the_alps_finally/dsnpgun/,LegalAssassin_swe,1515918146

It might be easier to maintain discipline if we had more, smaller more-homogeneous parties, but that would involve changing the voting system from FPTP. ",Británico en España,/r/europe/comments/7q7gke/tories_take_credit_for_eu_directive/dsnph0r/,dpash,1515918157

As in the [widely reported case of Just Eat](http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/just-eat-50p-service-charge-14135414), a vendor can comply by slapping the same charge on all payment methods. Hence this regulation is to the benefit of credit card companies, who can continue to charge a premium for their service - the government will force *other* payment methods to subsidise it!

If only more people watched Sesame Street in the 70s:

&gt; Mr. Hooper has a plate with cookies, and another plate that's empty. He gives Cookie Monster a bag of cookies, and asks him to make the two plates look the same. Cookie Monster eats the bag of cookies, and then eats all the cookies on the plate. Now the two plates look the same!
